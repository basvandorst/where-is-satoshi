Do you want to part of a science project that may invert the global wealth pyramid?  Do you believe that counterfeiting should be impossible, for everyone, including banks and governments?  Do you see value in storing your wealth online and having access to it 24/7 from anywhere in the world regardless of capital controls?   Do you value financial privacy?  Do you like cutting edge technology?  Are you computer savy?   Do you like endless drama about scaling and which direction the price is going? Can you handle losing money if Bitcoin goes to zero for any number of reasons?

Many people argue against it everyday.  Direct blocksize increases require a hardfork because it breaks concensus.  That's not happening anytime soon, as we've seen XT, Unlimited,Classic, 1.x, etc..   
You're not getting a blocksize size increase without going through a contentious hardfork.
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:02:40
you're spreading the rbtc/xt/classic narrative word for word.  You are incorrect on all accounts.
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:08:13
nope,  Just watch the bitcoin days destroyed metric.
@_date: 2016-08-01 12:35:05


I doubt this will happen until we have exhausted all other options.  Even then, it will be met with a lot of opposition and still has a chance of splitting the chain in two.  The ease of a hardfork opens the door for more hardforks down the road, which directly conflicts with the early adopters principles of what Bitcoin is.  
Some see the opposition of hardforks as being the downfall of bitcoin, while others see it as the only way to ensure the 21M limit is never subverted.   It's an argument based on principles, the same way ETH/ETC split is based on principles.   
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:05:20
The only thing that has collapsed is your subs feeble attempts at hardforking based on several made up crisis. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:08:59
When you say you want the blocksize increase, what you really want is a throughput increase.  Segwit does this.   A direct blocksize increase, requires a hardfork, which will create two chains. I doubt you want that, but if you do, then you're essentially attacking bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:47:53
It's his company.
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:15:52
If it's contentious, then it's not happening without fracturing into two chains. Raising the blocksize may happen, but not for a few years and not until Lightning is tapped out and begging for more capacity.
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:52:07
the bigger question is, what good is ethereum once RSK comes out?
@_date: 2016-08-01 14:26:09
I'm pretty sure that the 2-way peg that it requires does.
@_date: 2016-08-01 05:53:38


It's the change in principles.  
The same would occur within Bitcoin if principles of decentalization, immutability or fungability are jeopardized.
@_date: 2016-08-01 09:41:29
Decentalization is arguably jeopardized by kicking a portion of the nodes off the network.  It's almost guaranteed to result in two bitcoins after a hardfork... Then ask yourself which Bitcoin will the ETFs track? It's a giant mess and therefore should be avoided.  Hence the current path of softfork improvements.  I think bitcoin can be a huge success, even if it never hardforks.
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:07:38
speculators are going to speculate.  Eth/etc is a perfect trade right now, so there's no reason to think bitcoins long term value proposition is being jeopardized by that clusterfuck.
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:44:00
I doubt we'll hardfork until Lightning network, and/or RSK needs it.  
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:17:31
Segwit transactions are cheaper, so obviously wallets will implement them unless they want to lose customers.
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:24:28
probably Zander or Justus R
@_date: 2016-08-01 09:49:38
Segwit does that.   Hardforks to change blocksize are not wise, especially after witnessing the eth/etc debacle.  Do you want two bitcoins chains?
@_date: 2016-08-01 09:41:49
Nope, we need more of them.

I'm sometimes surprised by the profanity that flies out of my mouth after reading Gavin's comments.  But I feel like his only purpose now is to cause drama.   He needs to accept the current trajectory and work within that roadmap if he wants to be helpful.  All this other shit he does is creating sides and fueling a pointless war.   We all want bitcoin to dominate!

Sounds like a blackswan event.  But the fact that we can identify all the variables and hypothesize about the outcome makes it unlikely to happen.  
 As the event gets closer, people will take precaution and limit exposure so they are not at risk and are not caught off guard.   Therefore, folks will not be rushing for the exits using onchain transactions moments before the halving.   They would have already moved their coins in anticipation, effectively nullifyiing the event entirely.
Markets are funny like that.

serious question.  which apps are synergistic on ethereum?
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:49:45
It is revolutionary.  The internet allowed permissionless expression and freedom of information.  Anyone can run a website and share information.  It's led to dictatorships collapsing.   Crytpo-currencies are going to lead to central banks losing their centralized command and control over the economy. 
You're going to be kicking yourself 10 years down the road for not realizing the impact this is going to have on the world.    The years to be skeptical were 2010-2015.  2016+ many people have realized this technology is not going away and begain investing.  It's now 2018, either learn or be left behind.  
Here's a live snapshot into bitcoin.     
@_date: 2016-04-30 23:32:57

@_date: 2018-01-11 20:33:32
Your arguments are very similar to the folks that didn't see the impact the internet would have on the world.    What could you do with the internet in 1995?   Proponents would say you can "chat",  check the weather, read news, etc..  Each of them had an analog version which skeptics would use against the internet.  We didn't see facebook, google, twitter, reddit, 4chan being possible in 1995.  
The fact is that digital money is far more efficient and allows anyone to participate in global commerce, crowd funding, investing, smart contracts, risk hedging, prediction markets, etc.   All financial activities that Wallstreet has had exclusive access to (and is a trillion $ industry) is now available to anyone with a smartphone.   
It's REVOLUTIONARY.

You're looking at the wrong stats.  The on-ramps are the exchanges.  They act like AOL, Compuserve, etc, in the 90s, creating a friending onramp into the new financial ecosystem.  Once you have Bitcoin, you can go anywhere.  Leaving behind the walled gardens and able to access a plethora of exchanges and financial services that were previously only available to those insde Wallstreet. 
Have you not seen exchanges stopping new signups because they can't handle all the demand?   This industry is expanding rapidly.

Bitcoin isn't about buying consumer goods.  Why would you convert fiat to BTC to buy something on Amazon when you can already do that with credit cards?   The reason you use Bitcoin is because it allows you to do things that weren't possible before.  Financial services.  Wallstreet in your pocket.

Read the first paragraph a few times.  There is a ton of emphasis on "trust".


trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.


allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The
system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
cooperating group of attacker nodes.
The only way to minimize trust, is to be able to run your our own node, therefor creating a decentralized network.

I'm onboard as long as you dont tout that artificial scaricity is needed for 'fee pressure'.  
Blocks should be allowed to scale up to handle load based on network usage.  Miners need enough blocksize flexibility to clear their mempools and also allow them to charge adequate fees to keep them in business.   Its up to them to figure how they will do this and which resources they should invest it to stay competitive.  (Hashpower,  electricity, bandwidth and storage)

True, and the folks that believe miners are selling all their bitcoins, aren't doing their ROI calculations correctly.
Bitcoin is going up in the long run.  It's just going to take a few years for it to happen.  1200 was a fat bubble that shook out a lot of coins.  We're still processing them today,  Eventually they'll land in a hoarders hands and supply/liquidity will draw up.  As long as the utility of bitcoin increases, then we should be good.

Note to readers: in its current form there is a near zero chance of this getting merged due to a number of BIP-level issues in addition to debate about the patch itself. For instance, Gavin has never given any details about testing; at minimum we'd need a BIP16 style quality assurance document. We also frown on writing software with building expiration dates, let alone expiration dates that trigger non-deterministically. (Note how my recently merged CLTV considered the year 2038 problem to avoid needing a hard fork at that date)

However, Bitcoin mining today has been industrialized by ASICs and access to cheap energy.    So no, I don't see any evidence in the white paper that he thought about energy generation as a centralizing factor.

The scary thing about Peter Todd's RBF Fuck All solution, is that it completely removes the nuances of our transaction rules.  If it went through, 0-confirmations transactions would be 100% unreliable.   He proposed this change because it gives his Level 2 Bitcoin more power.   
The alternative solution FSS RBF, that Peter also has a pull request for, supposedly ensures that first seen transaction outputs have priority and are not replaced.  We should probably review his code with a fined tooth comb to ensure he is not sneaking anything else in.  
Now think about what Peter just tried to do.  He tried to push a change that will cripple some use cases of Bitcoin in favor of his own. Unilaterally.  0 consensus. 
He literally attacked bitcoin, but was defeated by developers who are paying attention.
I don't want to scream too loud here, because you'll think I'm sensing a conspiracy, but look at what he tried to do!
This "bitcoin expert" can not be trusted because he is willing to destroy the things we love about bitcoin, to push his own agenda.

@_date: 2015-06-11 19:33:39
Because they can see that in the future it results in more profit?
Everyone is staring at the trees without seeing the forest.
* Less block reward = less profit  (known calculation)
* more transactions = more profit from fees  (unknown)
Miners need to define a fee schedule that consumers need to pay to receive the utility that the miners provide.  It's as simple as that.
The devs don't need to worry about the economics.  Miners just need to collude a little bit and determine what their fees are to stay in business.
The same way you used to pay 50 cents for sms messages, or $20 for overnight mail.  They define the price and you pay for it because you value the utility.   
Running an auction model because of limited space in a block is retarded.
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:17:30

No, bitcoin is for the people, not the State.   Bitcoin puts so many constraints on a modern state that it would have to be rebuilt from the ground up on a solid monetary footing.

And yet it doesn't happen. 


If that is true, then why are you here trying to sway us with your FUD?  Decentralization is important, but 1MB blocks will strangle this baby in its crib. 
You'll probably cite node counts, but the likely reason node counts are dropping is because the price is down and we have SPV wallets.  Bandwidth costs are negligible.   But even if bandwidth costs were expensive, would you rather have a bunch of bitcoin businesses running nodes as part of their business model?  Or a bunch of nodes ran by hobbyists? 


This can't be. You have VC money backing you.  Unless you're saying that none of you are looking to profit from bitcoin, in which case, you're probably saying this from the perspective of Blockchain yes, bitcoin no. Does this mean you don't think it will become a currency, but instead a settlement network?   
Come out and say it.   Peter Todd is forward with his opinion.  He thinks it should be a settlement network with hub and spoke bullshit, just like the existing banking system.  L1 bitcoin will cost a fortune, just like wire transfers today, and all of our money will be locked inside of 3rd parties once again.
We know that that is not the system Satoshi envisioned.  Gavin is staying true to the vision of Bitcoin.


I think it's funny that you "proved" that a distributed consensus is impossible before Satoshi proved you wrong.  And I think this goes to the heart of the problem between the programmers working on Bitcoin today and the free market mechanisms that Satoshi built into bitcoin in the first place.  You guys understand the code, but you miss the big picture.  Programmers broke the market based scaling mechanism with the 1MB cap based on an irrational fear of spam.  AKA premature optimization.  Satoshi wanted it removed in the future.  You guys were worried about dice games filling up blocks, but fast forward to today and we have stress tests because micro transactions have been discouraged because of hard drive space.  Another premature optimization.
Essentially, you guys have broken bitcoin and now you're prepared to turn it into something it was not meant to be.  
and are the only ones staying true to Satoshi's vision.

Why do we have to talk about fees in this debate?   Miners have the power to charge us a fair market price to transact on bitcoin.  We don't need artificial scaricity to get me to pay 20 cents per transaction,  or whatever the actual costs for them to secure the network are.  I will pay for the utility to use bitcoin,  the same way I used to pay 50 cents per SMS message.  
I swear this debate sounds like a bunch of aircraft designers arguing how big a plane should be based on how much customers should pay for a ticket to ensure all airlines succeed.

I look at it as a proof of concept.  The gain is that the device is plug and play and generates satoshis which can be used to pay for services.  Simple as that.  Any argument about profit from mining is ridiculous and shouldn't even be entertained.
Another interesting thing is that all the devices have the same mining capability so they create a base cost of services for their test economy.

@_date: 2015-06-03 18:24:31
How can a miner consume more resources than he is giving back?    If he wins a block, then he has to have some substantial amount of mining power, which is helping to secure the network.    A block limit ensures that he can't clear all transactions from the mempool.   This creates a bottleneck on the entire network, which is far worse than allowing him to create a large block containing peoples transactions.

I think the more likely scenario for companies is to issue a portion of stock as crypto.  Say 5% of their company is represented as a crypto like colored coins.  These coins represent ownership in the company.  This means we can have peer to peer transactions of stock instead of an arbitrary company currency.   Stock is bound to the fundamentals of the company, thus it should always have value as long as the company exists.  
Pay for a beer with a portion of Amazon stock, why not?   Tip a friend with some FB stock.  etc.  
It's not about currency, it's about ease of exchange of something valuable.  With color coins, that underlying asset can be anything.

1) This is true for anything that appreciates.  You have to pay taxes on the gains.  I'm not sure how anyone ever thought we could get around this.  
2) Simple computer program.  No trust required.  It can be built directly into your wallet or tax software.  
3) When reporting your taxes you have to make a decision of what accounting method to use.  LIFO or FIFO. Easy, and the software will do all the calculations accordingly.  Logically everyone should use FIFO because you'll have a reduced tax burden for coins over a year old.  There's no reason to pick newer coins. Ever.

The miners job is to append to the ledger,  They don't give a fuck about attacks.  They don't even know an attack is happening unless there's a "unusual" amount of orphans and chain reorgs.  And even if they do realize an attack happens, all a miner can do is point his hash power at a different pool, which they assume isn't being malicious.    Miners are fucking idiots.   All of this hype about securing the ledger is bullshit.   The network of nodes secures bitcoin,  miners are rent a cops.  If they ever act malicious, we fire them and hire new ones.     
This is what a miners does:
sha(sha(blockheader)) == 00000000   (some number of zeros, per difficulty)
and if they find the answer, they broadcast it, appending to the ledger.

Miners aren't mining to prevent attacks.  They're mining to get block rewards.   How does this guy not understand the basic incentive structure?




by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides
a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending
resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

You mean the snake oil sales men?   Those guys are such frauds. 


That's the funny thing about economic systems.  You can't A/B test them so everything is conjecture.
However, I really wonder what our transaction rates would be if we didn't have caps and dust limits.  Would we have 8MB blocks today naturally?  Or would the network be spammed to death by peter todd, just to prove a point?  
Without these limits, miners would have to cope with these variables and plan accordingly.  We would probably be surprised with the things they would come up with.  I highly doubt bitcoin would be dead without limits.


Are you saying that orphan rates will be too high?   What is "too high"?  Isn't that just another variable that miners have to optimize for?  Sounds to me like the free market at work, fixing problems.   If miners in China can't play with large blocks, then maybe they need to mine in a country that has more expensive power, but better connectivity.   All of these variables balance out.

There is always an issue with Colored coins being backed by something.  There would have to be some trusted market maker that issues options and then delivers.   Havelock investments seems to be trusted for bitcoin IPOs so I could imagine them getting into this market.  And it's technically possible for exchanges like BTCE to do it as well.
.... Actually it seems like Options creation could be automated.   You deposit the coins, create an options contract, and push it out to the market.  Then once the option expires an algorithm performs the distribution.  Relatively simple. =)

Exactly, so we either have businesses running nodes for their own benefit to verify transactions and they will include that cost in their business model, OR we make the network so restricted and bottlenecked that every neckbeard on earth can run a node for fun.


Nope, if bitcoin provides enough utility for your business then it should be worth it for you to run a node.  
If bitcoin is a success we should have way more than 6000 businesses running nodes for their own operations.   That would be a huge success.

Speeding up the block time also increases mining rewards, which completely fucks bitcoins inflation schedule.  It also means that if you change it once, people will be expecting it to be changed again later down the road to increase rewards or something dumb.  The block reward interval is about work being done over time and the odds of orphaned blocks.  10minutes is a sweet spot.  Coins that have faster blocktimes have higher odds of orphans.  Which means that your transaction confirms, you walk out of the store and a minute later the block is orphaned.  It's all about time, not fast blocks.

You can't force in a gigantic block without it propagating to 51% of the other nodes.  The larger the block the more difficult this becomes and this is prime reason why some mining ops choose not to include any transactions.

I get what you're saying. We've heard it here a million times.  The fact is that currencies, commodities, stocks, etc fluctuate based on supply and demand.  As more liquidity comes into the market, it will stabilize.
Look at the S&amp;P500, what if THAT was your money over the past few years?  What if you could spend and exchange S&amp;P500 "bucks", without the tax man chasing you down for "capital gains".   You would feel pretty rich right now, correct?.    That's what are proper currency that doesn't inflate is supposed to look like.  It would go up in value as an economy grows. It's probably the simplest most prosperous feedback loop in nature.  
Instead we're stuck shuffling this shitty fiat garbage which allows for governments around the globe to overspend, tax us and then we get hit by inflation too.  This is the system that allows the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer.  
That is why I am an user and shareholder of Bitcon.

Its pretty obvious if you understand the relationship between banking and governments.    they use monetary tools to stimulate growth, increase inflation, cool down bubbles, etc.  Crypto currencies have their own inflation rate that the government and banks can't control.   eventually this will cause issues for them and they will probably become hostile towards the competition. Its not difficult to understand the potential conflict.

Oh, you mean the employer chooses to reduce pay to a point that the employee quits?  Good.  That's a real market that is NOT based on exploiting the average joes knowledge of economics.  At least it is presented to the employee as a choice.   
In the current market they will probably work for years getting raises that they may think is generious, but are still below inflation.  Then the government steps in as the ole mighty savior and raises minimum wage for the common Joe forcing businesses to comply.
Of course with the minimum wage increase, unemployment goes up b/c some jobs just aren't worth X.  Yeaaah, lets continue this cycle forever.

Think about how toxic our political system is currently and how partisan it is.  There is an exact line in the sand between Liberal and Conservative media.   Every politician is tared and feathered when they vote.  They are directly called out in public and are mocked by one side or the other.   There is no middle ground, because votes are either yes or no.   
No wonder everyone is "hard on crime", that's the only publicly sensible position to have, however that leads directly to our over populated prisons and many other problems.

That's right,  It's not fucking DOGECOIN!!!  Are you fucking kidding me?   Your shit is worth 27 Million dollars and dropping every day.   Hollywood prima donnas make more than that in a single year.
Just wait until Bitcoin can handle hundreds of millions of dollars, or billions of dollars.  We have at least two more giant jumps before we top out and billionaries can move their wealth to bitcoin.   At that point we will be global and mainsteam.    Marketcap matters more than a meme, toaster boy.
This is Bitcoins end game. 
The only people who trade in Fiat currencies are State employees.  Everyone else will work for a specific companies currency. You will work for Overstock dollars, Google dollars, Sam's Glass Shop dollars, etc, all made possible by Colored Coins.  You will either hold those dollars or trade them on an open exchange to a prefered currency.  Imagine a system where your money is company stock.   Of course Bitcoin will be THE independant currency.  The global reserve currency.  It's perfect because it IS based on nothing...  nothing except our faith in a system that is better than the one that exists.
All other currencies will float on an open P2P liquid market, exchanging between each other based on supply and demand of their company fundamentals.  Companies will have to compete in every manner to make sure their currency is competivitve in the market.    It doesn't just mean good profits and dividends,  but in popularity, doing what's right, not being evil.  In a moments notice, you could swap your currency for something else.  We hold currencies that WE see as being beneficial to our world view.   Don't like nuclear energy?  Short them!  Like self driving cars?  Buy stock/currency in those companies.   The entire stock market and currency markets will become one.   Fiat = States, Stocks = Companies.  All will be openly traded by everyone in the world.
Anyone will be able to actively trade on their phone anywhere in the world.
The stock market is currently for the upper middle class.  The folks with 401ks and IRAs.  There is a huge percentage of the people in the world that doesn't even have a bank account.   
Reduce the barriers and we will have a global market that doesn't discriminate financially.

You are trying to debate everyone in here from the perspective that you already know how miners are going to behave.   You will be proven wrong because nothing in the market is as black and white as you make it sound.  
Remember, miners are speculators too.   Their ROI calculation is not simply:
if( cost today &lt; revenue today) mine()
else sitWithThumbInAssAndWatchHardwareDepreciate()
Every miners ROI calculation is based on a different vision of what the future price of bitcoin will be.

I don't see why not.  In your example, you want to record that X was at Y location at Z time.

Yep, except that the marginal cost of including a transaction is near 0.  So once the block reward halves a few more times, miners will have to figure out how they can keep fees high enough to ensure they cover costs, but low enough to encourage usage.    That's the market.

I don't think it's 100%, but I think that if a crypto-currency survives, it's gonna be bitcoin.  And I think that if a fixed currency is every going to exist it's gonna be bitcoin.
You don't have to be very smart to figure out that one currency is designed to inflate while another one is not.  The price volatility so far shows that there is a lot of interest in such a thing.   If there wasn't, Bitcoin would still be worth less than a dollar.
Many people may never 'get' bitcoin and that's fine, but it's going to be ubiquitous on the internet regardless.  
Know why?  Because all the programmers who built the early internet are here exploring Bitcoin and are making it happen.  I work in this space, I see programmers eyes light up with possibilities.   Many amazing apps are waiting to be built.   This snowball has just started rolling.


You're right, I may not be in touch with reality.  But that's probably because I live and work on the bleeding edge wanting everything to be faster and frictionless.  Bitcoin is frictionless and freedom.

Upload/Downloading of blocks is not required with bloom filters, which is the entire point of that link is4k gave you.  Majority of transactions are already in the mem-pools of the miners.

From the white paper.
The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.
Satoshi used the word POOL in the white paper.  He knew it would happen.

In a perfect world money would not inflate like it has in the past.  All holders of it would reap the benefits of being an integral part of the shared economy. 
In the current system, banks and governments have the privilege to create money out of thin air.  Everyone else in the system feels the repercussions of this via inflation.
Bitcoin is designed to put an end to this and it's sort of based on the concept of Ideal Money.

No, they don't store the "password".  It's a single use auth handshake that your wallet would make using on a nonce.  
Your username becomes a bitcoin public address of which there is a ridiculous number of.   [Fun with numbers](   
This means that everyone would have a different username for each website.  Breaking into the database to steal usernames/passwords becomes completely pointless because they don't mean anything.   Hackers wouldn't have stockpiles data for rainbow table attacks and there wouldn't be a market for this information any more.

Scarcity makes something more valuable.  That's why gold still has value after all these years.   Satoshi designed it this way on purpose because it's arguably better than forever inflating fiat currencies.
Dogecoin is forever inflating... Or have a look at Friecoin which uses demurrage to discourage hording and promote spending.   
However, given the choice, why would you choose to store value in a depreciating currency?
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:22:08
What is up with your attitude? 
Sidechains do alleviate pressure on Bitcoin main, because all transactions that take place in them are propagated within the miners that merge mine that sidechain.  Most other miners don't need to know about it.  
Each sidechain can be as fat or lean as they want depending on what the chain is used for.
When I was at the Blockstream event they talked about Governments using sidechains.  If this turns out to be true, then you can imagine a government being the one that merge mine their alt-chain and define specific rules and taxes on transactions.   This would also keep their transactions within their network and would not "clog" the submarine pipelines you're so concerned about.

If we're talking about a &gt;$50 transaction then you should wait for a confirmation.. if you're paranoid.  But for media sites and pay per view access we're talking about .50 to .99 cents.  How many people are honestly going to go through the trouble of trying to perform a double spend on a transaction of that size?   It is possible, but it's not very likely.     
What's the issue again with a .03 fee?   That's not very much at all and it's meant to prevent transaction spam. (old dice games).  Actually the minimum fee is only in the reference client.  You can use a smaller fee with other wallets.  It may take longer for the transaction to be included in a block, but it's an open market so it will work itself out.

Compared with other payments systems, Bitcoin notably lacks a governance structure to shape
or constrain its operations. For example, Bitcoin imposes no obligation for a financial institution,
payment processor, or other intermediary to verify a user’s identity or cross-check with watchlists or embargoed countries. Second, Bitcoin imposes no prohibition on sales of particular
items; in contrast, for example, credit card networks typically disallow all manner of transactions
unlawful in the place of sale. Finally, Bitcoin payments are irreversible in the sense that the
protocol provides no way for a payor to reverse an accidental or unwanted purchase, whereas
other payment platforms, such as credit cards, do include such procedures

I've read that some miners create smaller blocks to ensure their block propagates fastest.  This behavior creates a special market dynamic that IBLT would completely remove if Bitcoin was O(1).   In my opinion this is an actual problem of today that should be fixed before raising the blocksize.   Blocks still aren't very full.   You could completely remove the blocksize today and I doubt it will change anything because the miners incentive is to keep the blocks small.   I doubt we'll ever get to 40MB blocks without IBLT because miners will be scaling out transactions across multiple blocks for the sake of propagation.  We see this behavior today and our blocks are like 300 to 600k.   
I read most of your IBLT gist and it sounds like it's the holy grail that will allow Bitcoin to scale for years to come.  At this point you are right that technically we don't need IBLT, but its more about changing mining incentives before the current ones give us more problems.  It would make the network more efficient and we should stop seeing empty blocks.  
Empty blocks are a sign that market incentives are not aligned correctly and some miners are not doing their job.  They're being selfish and hurting the network.  IBLT should fix that.
Anyway, keep up the good work.

Exactly, if they actually offered something novel, then we would use it.  But otherwise Alts are pump and dump schemes. 
Also miners have to choose which sidechains to merge mine, thus allowing them to vote for which tech they want to survive.  This will introduce a new level of fragmentation which could dilute Bitcoins network effect.  We don't know how this will affect the market.  
What motivates a miner to choose which chains to merge mine?  How is that corruptible?  Who accepts these coins and more importantly WHO exclusively accepts certain coin and who mines it?  Lots of interesting dynamics will grow out of these choices and we should very be cautious here.  We could be opening Pandora's box.

This "doomsday scenario" is happening all around the world right now.  Don't you watch the news?  Do you pay attention to anything outside of your little bubble?  Probably not, since you're trying to represent the "average joe".
Argentina default or the situation in Venezuela...
Look at the ever increasing debt to gdp ratios of countries around the world, and the relation to inflation rates.
Do you know how Rome collapsed ?
One significant reason is:   
"Constant wars and overspending had significantly lightened imperial coffers, and oppressive taxation and inflation had widened the gap between rich and poor."
Everyones wealth evaporated as the empire fell.   There are so many examples of this throughout history, it's unbelievable that people don't think it will happen again.
Taking a step back, do you even realize that you are on the internet right now??  The internet is a distributed network that was built by the same geeks that are building out Bitcoin today using the exact same principles.  At the heart, it's a distributed global communication network that is designed to allow anyone in the world the freedom to access information, innovation, trade, and, now with Bitcoin, borderless financial services.
Many books were written on how the internet would change the world and how it would threaten oppressive governments.  That sounds like "whacko" talk right??  But the fact is, we see it happening all the time now.  The same will be true for bitcoin.  You can stick your fingers in your ears and yell "la,la,la,la" all you want, but it's going to happen.
Money that is independent from the State has been needed for thousands of years.  It's now here and it CAN'T be uninvented. 
You are right that average joe doesn't have much use for Bitcoin, the same way he didn't have much use for the internet in 1992.

You have no idea when exactly he bought.   You just pulled a fortnight schedule out of your ass and assumed he bought like a robot every 2 two weeks.  What if it was approximately every 2 weeks?   what if he doubled down when the price was at a sweet spot.   The point of this post is dollar cost averaging.I've been dollar cost averaging for the past 6 months too. But I also bought at various other sweet spots and I've also spent BTC along the way.  My account is waaaay up.   if I make a post about DCA, do I have to post my transaction history to convince you DCA works ?  If I approximate does that make me a liar?    DCA is investing 96.

Knowing that certain friends accept bitcoin creates a small economy amongst yourselves.  It must go way beyond watching the price and thinking that you're getting rich.  They just need to realize that it's value transfer. Plain and simple.

Only in hind sight does it look like a zero risk operation.  I heard about bitcoin in 2011,  tried mining for a few hours, but I didn't win any blocks,  my computer was near over heating and the value of coins was near 0.  I didn't want to invest anymore time or electricity, so I stopped.   some people decided to stick with it, spending their time, money on something that was worth nothing.  The risk is your time and money.

That's not internet regulation.  That's IP enforcement and drug enforcement.  The same laws that exist when you walk outside are still in effect when you're online.
This entire conversation is about additional regulation that is supposed to make the bitcoin environment "safe", but when you look around Coinbase has already implemented tons of new security features as have many other sites with NO formal regulation.

Sure, but the large shops want ROI and they have real investors that will pull the plug on their financing forcing them to liquidate.  They all over built hoping for $4k within the next 18 months, but it's nowhere insight.   I expect many large shops to go out of business if the price doesn't rise substantially.  
Who is going to buy their old equipment?   Hobbyists, because they have a primary income already and their ROI target is probably 10 years out, if that.  Large operations are more like 6-18 months out and they have real expenses that eat millions of dollars.... eventually the plug will be pulled.

ok ok, 
It doesn't have to compete on transaction volume.  Large companies can perform settlements on a periodic basis, which should alleviate the need to have every transaction hit the network. Imagine if Facebook had a bitcoin wallet and you bought something from Amazon.  That transaction doesn't have to hit the bitcoin network.  Facebook could send Amazon an IOU through Ripple/Stellar, then settle up with a bitcoin transaction at the end of the day.   However, If businesses never hold bitcoin, then they are just using it as a payment rail and should instead use Ripple or Stellar to send USD.
IMO, The success of bitcoin hinges on it having value and acting as a store of wealth over fiat currencies.  Theoretically, based on the track record of fiat, bitcoin should win given enough time.   
Side chains and tree chains *may* solve the scaling issues, but they're still very experimental.

Bitcoin is going to exist along side all other financial instruments.  State fiat currencies aren't going anywhere.  However, the State needs to watch their inflation targets, because the common man(anyone with a cell phone) can buy Bitcoin and hedge against out of control State spending.   
Imagine if Bitcoin was an option for Argentinians in 1999.   While State fiat was inflating away, they could have started using Bitcoin for exchanges instead, thus preserving a portion of their wealth.    Yes, Bitcoin is volitile, but State fiat is historically on a crash course to destruction.  It's only a matter of time.
The thing that excites me the most about the future of crypo-currencies is colored coins and all the new global financial instruments that can be created and exchanged.  Global P2P stocks, bonds and options.

ZOMG, let me connect the dots for you.  
The reason most people create accounts is because it allows you to save your CC information so you don't have to type it in the next time you shop.   
IMO and most bitcoiners, is that it is strangly liberating to arrive at a payment screen enter your address, (which your browser pre-fills)  click on a bitcoin link to have your wallet open and send a payment in a few clicks.  You no longer feel like you need to create an account because it's really easy to shop without it.
Sense you are being extra dense and smug, I'll also add that there are ways to use the blockchain and pub/private keys to completely replace usernames and passwords.  Your public key becomes you AccountID and all you have to do is sign a message with your private key and it validates your identity.   It's completely secure.   The days of having to remember usernames and passwords are numbered.  Especially with multisig wallets and 2fa.

Price volatility is natural for something like Bitcoin.  I can stomach all the wild swings, because I understand what it is.  You clearly do not if you quote a single price decline as your evidence against me and then ignore the price increase over the past few years and the increase in adoption.
Bitcoin is spendable.   Have you ever been to another country and offered to pay with USD over their local currency and they jump at?  I've been all over the world and I've never had anyone turn down a USD.  It's going to be the exactly same way on the internet with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is going to replace Paypal for P2P spending.  It's giving birth to microtransactions.  And with ATM rollouts we're closing the gap between the re-world economy and bitcoin economy.  I'll be able to store my wealth in the cloud and pull out cash in any country.  Without any bank or government knowing anything about it.  Freedom.
Did you know that your browser already has support for bitcoin the same way it does for email?  Bitcoin is not going away.  It's only going to become more prevalent as developers close the usability gap..  Bitcoin has huge potential that we developers have only started to tap.  I build software and web apps for a living.

That's the way all transaction are.  Miners are not required to bundle up any transactions if they don't want to.   This gives them the ability to pick and choose transactions which allows them to create a dynamic fees market(Uber/supply/demand) instead of hardcoding arbitrary fee amounts.
It's much more flexible.

No, I mean, that's the way the whole world balances itself.   Supply and demand.  It's when you have artificial floors or ceilings that create problems and imbalances.
Is there a better solution?  Maybe some arbitrary bureaucrat can set an arbitrary rate and force all miners to do their bidding?

Yes, it is theft,  google freicoin,  its a fork that has demurrage.  Basically the money in your wallet erodes and is recycled through the miners.   interesting idea, but chains like this can't compete with no thieving chains.  No one with half a brain will voluntarily use something that losses value when there is an alternative that doesn't.  This is why fiat is doomed in the long run even if it becomes digital.
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:33:43


Look at it this way.  Bitcoin is sort of like real estate.  Real estate is fixed, in that the Earth isn't growing, and as our population increases we must fit in the existing space.  This creates an increasing demand for a limited resource.
Historically, land goes up in value as populations increase in certain areas.  In addition, if my neighbor does renovations on his house, it increases the value of my property as well.  His investment in his property spreads outward to the surrounding neighborhood.  This is well documented and everyone agrees that this is how real estate works.   
It could be the exact same way with a currency like bitcoin or a fixed asset that can be easily exchanged.  As businesses and individuals increase production and economic activity it has to be represented in the underlying currency.  More commerce equals more demand for a fixed amount of units which increases in value(work done) as output increases.
This is how our money SHOULD have always worked since the beginning of time.  This bullshit theory saying that your underlying currency MUST deprecate for a stable economy is the biggest lie in history.   
Bitcoin is the first currency that can be 100% accounted for and ensure that the value put into the system can not be stolen through inflation by the issuers.
Google 'constant dollar GDP' and you'll see what I'm talking about.  A dollar from 1950 SHOULD be worth more today.
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:06:29
Once the reward halves it turns into short game of chicken.  
Everyone will be expecting the other guy to turn off their rigs, so that they can get a larger share of the block reward.  If no one turns off their rig, then everything says the same.  If 50% bail out, then the remaining miners make what they used to make before the halving.  It will probably be along the lines of a 10-30% decrease in hash power, but that is highly dependant on what the price is doing.  If we're in a bull market, then it probably won't matter.  If we're in a bear market, some people will turn off their most inefficient miners.
Another thing you have to consider is that when you run a real mining operation, you can claim expenses on your taxes. (hardware and electricity) 
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:32:18
No, I'm saying that you pay for fraud in the price of all goods.  It's baked into the credit card processing fees.  Businesses pay for it first and then pass the fees on to you in the price of the goods.   
When you get refunded for a fraudulent charge that money comes from the CC processing fees that every merchant pays on a continuous basis.  The system is all connected.

1 If you're into politics, then it's fun to think about the political ramifications of borderless internet money and what it will do to states ability to tax and control commerce as more and more commerce take place purely online.  Digital goods, micro transactions, gambling, etc.   It comes back to freedom and the feeling that our government and banks have overstepped the boundaries outlined in our constitution.  In general though, I'm excited about all the great things that have come from the internet age.  Twitter, Bitcoin, Bittorrent, Google and many others are blazing the way to give people access to an unprecedented amount of information and person freedom.  Things are changing.  Bitcoin is just another piece of the puzzle.
2 I love to speculate on how technology will change the world, so I put my money where my mouth is.  I think that bitcoin has a huge opportunity to redefine what we think of as money.  And seeing how polarized people are about Bitcoin proves that it's happening.  Owning bitcoin is like holding shares in everything that grows out of this technology.   I think it's going to be huge and I'm not afraid to say it.
3 Delusions,  suure.  I like to speculate and dream of a crazy world where people can transact with each other without any middle party.  I can send value to anyone connected to the internet, regardless of country, with bitcoin.  I also think that Bitcoin could give rise to pay-per-view news, blogs, movies, that don't require any identity information.  Which is a complete reversal of the advertising centric model we have today.  This is exciting because frankly, I'm tired of entering my CC information into every site and then worry about identity theft.  Or having my card be declined, because my bank thinks a transaction is risky.  
3b Paranoid, na, I don't worry about it.  I understand how the internet currently works.  The world would have to make a huge swing to an authoritarian government to stop the current trend we're on.   The price fluctuations don't bother me either because it's just fickle speculators having fun gambling.

Paying with cash is cheaper in a lot of States.  Businesses are required to list the CC surcharge on their receipts so that consumers are aware of it.

@_date: 2014-12-21 02:51:52
The thing you don't get is that Bitcoin is libertarian.  It doesn't matter if the world isn't libretarian, when they use bitcoin they are using our money.   Our philosophy is hardcoded in the algorithms that govern it.  If Bitcoin subscribed to keynesianism, it would have had inflation build in, if it subscribed to being controlled by a single party, it would have reported itself to the government and asked for permission to exist.
It's like half of the people here didn't read the sidebar and they don't understand the root of what was invented here.  So here it is again.


That description screams libertarianism, which is free market, personal responsibility, and no government/bank.

Oh and then you're going to send that regulation out to every Bitcoin exchange in the world at which point they will read it and laugh in your face because you can't do price fixing in a free market.

Bitcoins decentralized nature that requires mining to secure it is also a potential attack vector that a government would not open its self up to.  Imagine countries trying to 51% each other.  There is also no reason for a government to reward people for this function.  They would use a centralised system that doesnt need a democratic 51 percent consensus to "validate" transactions.  See Ripple, and also why it has no value.

That bank just made that money up and now they're going to collect the interest from it.    If we had a P2P lending system, that interest would go to savers.

The difference I was trying to point out is that the conversation dynamic between the employeer and the employee flips. 
Currently the employee has to go to the employeer and argue for a raise.  If they are not assertive or able to present a good argument, then they get left behind and will work at the same job for years without a raise.  
In a defaltionary environment, the employee gets raises automatically and the employeer has to come to the employee and make the argument for the pay reduction.
IMO the employee has the upper hand in a deflationary environment.

Why can't we reflect on the blockchain to see how full the blocks are and then set the maxblocksize accordingly.  It's essentially the same way we set the mining difficultly.  We just have to decide on the target.  
For example, Blocks should be 75% full.. If we are above that threshold, the block size gets adjusted up, if we're below, block size is reduced.  
Then we never have to revisit it again.

The "thing" that is currency is going to be irrelevant soon.  Anything that has "value" can act as currency with blockchain technology.   We all know that textbooks claim that currency must have those attributes, but that's going to change.
Eventually, we'll have stocks represented as crypo that we can trade and spend as easily as bitcoins.  We'll be able to spend Amazon, Apple, SPY stock at Starbucks.    The base or reserve currency will be bitcoin, since the blockchain will be at the heart of all value transfers.
I'm sure governments will still have their currency and demand that we pay taxes in it, but otherwise everyone else will choose to transact value using anything else.   Government fiat will be the last item on the list of things we'll use as currency.   We'll actually have to buy their bonds directly instead of having the Fed do it for us and then steal our productivity and hard work via inflation.    
Those cats are going to be irrelevant.

Good to hear that there are proponents of Bitcoin chiming in.  
IMO, Bitcoin is the only solution, especially since bitcoin: protocol handler is already in browsers and the HTML5 spec.  Another reason is that Bitcoin is not a company, but instead an open source value transfer protocol built specifically for the internet.
As we've seen over the past few months, websites are getting hacked left and right and stealing huge amounts of credit card information that can be very damaging to someones real identity.  If we all used Bitcoin, e-commerce sites would not be the honey pots they are today.  
This is the quote that stood out the most.

Stocks and Currencies become essentially the same thing because they are easily transactable.  This means Stocks = Currencies.  Sending Bitcoin to Kenya is just as easy as sending Apple stock to Kenya.   If Apple pays a dividend on stock holders then everyone owning even a fraction of a share will receive it.
Why would someone pay using Apple Stock?  Maybe because that's what the merchant or individual requested.  Maybe they want some Apple stock to go allow with their Tesla stock.   But they don't accept Monsanto stock no matter what.   
Who knows what all the potential use cases are.

Yes you can.  
Also DRM for music, movies, ebooks.
You would have to have a media apps that know how to validate against the blockchain, but technicially it's possible.
Imagine an artist creating only 100 copies of their B-Sides album by issuing 100 colored coins.   They can then sell the coins on a open market, just like an IPO.  A few years later, you can sell your colored coin to someone else, thus exchanging ownership.   
It allows you to create verifiable scarcity of digital content.  
It's fucking amazing.

Consumer protection should actually be consumer education.  
We need websites that we can trust to provide legit reviews of merchants.  This includes the individuals running it.  
If we can't get our money back, then we have to do the work up front to ensure that we are not being scammed.  This work can be crowd sourced and I see a huge opportunity in this space.   We also need community auditors that investigate sites and ensure that they are complaint to OUR requirements before they get our stamp of approval.
This is very similar to what bureaucrat regulators would do when they create laws and force business to comply or be fined.  Since the internet is not centralized, we (internet users) have to create our own trust system and requirements that businesses must comply to before they get our business.  
In a free and competitive market, we decide who we trust and who we want to do business with.  Vote with your Bitcoin.

The upper class are immune to inflation because their wealth is distributed across real assets.   Poor people only hold fiat, which is depreciating year over year and they don't have the extra money to invest in things that beat inflation.  This is why the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  
Bitcoin on the other hand, allows everyone to hold hard money (in theory, because it's deflationary).  This allows them to actually save money over time.  It is currently impossible to save money in a savings account and beat inflation.

What they're saying is that the entity that created the sidechain have an incentive to mergemine their chain to allow transactions to flow back and forth.  However, if the sidechain is something the majority of the community wants, then a few mining pools may choose to mine it too.  See namecoin.  
One use case the Blockstream guys were tossing around at their launch event was the possibility of government sidechains.  In that case the government would merge mine their chain to allow coins to flow between the two worlds.

I'm about 100 pages in and I'm not buying that mining is going to ruin the planet and cause the entire earth to be covered in Solar panels.   He's essentially saying that Bitcoin has to use 51% of the worlds energy to ensure the security of the network.  All value created by the network goes to miners in a zero-sum game creating useless hardware and burning through energy.  If that is played out, Bitcoin is going to turn the world into the next Easter Island, all in the name of creating a system with no trust.

Exactly.  The early adopters and people pushing the technology are getting hosed because no one else in the market wants to hold Bitcoin.  They see it as a payment rail and not a commodity/currency.

Not necessarily.  Backing it with stock means that it would be worth what the stock price is.  
Creating a currency out of thin air, which has miners, fees, new coins etc, creates a very strange dynamic market that is completely different from a companies stock price.  
If 1 Amazon coin = 1 share of stock, then all the research and evaluations of the company will immediately be represented in the colored coin and stock, since they are the same.

You seem to think that costs of ASIC hardware will always be expensive.
I believe the market will work itself out.  ASIC hardware advances are likely to plateau in the next 6-12 months, which will then cause hardware costs to drop.  Once prices drop a redistrubution of mining equipment will occur and the market will reshape itself again.

I kind of wanted a better explanation than that.
Is it that the mining majority will include a bunch of span to increase block size, thus pushing out the little guys in the long run?
Or is it a technical issue, like you can't easily lookup the number of transactions per block and/or have it enforced across all mining nodes?

Not really.  It's all about work being done.   Work in this case is computer cycles.  If a computer is running at 100% to do X, then it doesn't matter what X is.  If the chip is at idle, then it is not being utilized at full capacity and therefor can be tweaked and optimized to do more work over a time span which outcompetes the competitor.   
At the heart of Bitcoins zero trust system IS competition.  Without fierce competition you end up with a system that has to have a gentlemans agreement(POS), which is not zero trust.  The energy used to secure Bitcoin is the price we pay.  Some don't like it, but history shows that we can't trust "trusted" parties.   
Ripple and Stellar are trusted digital currency platforms.  They are faster and more efficient, but you have to trust the creators.   These platforms also suffer because they don't have a natural bootstrapping mechanism like Bitcoin.
The fierce competition for the diminishing block reward gives Bitcoin its value.  Otherwise in the case of Ripple and Stellar you're just handing out tokens to those who want them.  Users didn't put any energy into the system, so holders of the token don't see it having much value in return. It's literally monopoly money.  There are billions sitting out there just wanting to be handed out at the creators discretion.  Zero work = zero effort = zero value.
Work = Computers crunching number = electricity being used = Value.

This marks the beginning of Scrypt mining scale up phase.  These machines are going to be way more efficient than GPU mining.  GPU miners will have to switch to the next most inefficient coin. Or go nuts on Max Kiesers Quarkcoin.
I'd guess that Bitcoin should be maxing out mining technology within the next 18 months.  I think we're down to 14nm chips in KnC Neptunes.   Another generation or two and the improvements should plateau.  Which will cause another phase of scaling out for Bitcoin miners.  Thats when mining may become democratized again.  Only the deep pockets can keep up with new hardware every 6 months.

The main issue with block size is the initial broadcast of a new block to all nodes.  Bloomfilters make it so the initial broadcast message is always the same size.  This means you can create blocks with virtually unlimited transactions in them and not have to worry about propagation times.  Storing the full blockchain on a hard disk then becomes the only issue and even that isn't a big deal... Just look at the recent hard capacity advancements..  However, that doesn't even matter because most nodes don't even need the full blockchain, they just need unspent outputs, which is a fraction of the size.Tldr; bitcoin can scale

Compared to our entire financial industry and all the fees they collect?


Mainly because of regulation or lack there of and AML laws.  Otherwise it would be dead simple to buy/sell BTC and also buy anything you want with it.  It's getting easier though. It's a work in progress, like most technology.


That sounds like the practice that nearly destroyed the financial markets in 2009.


It's the price we pay for having a zero-trust system.


Any law worth a damn can be written in code and enforced via the blockchain.

Basically governments would have to use sidechains to gain control over their economy to tax and regulate things.  It's pretty scary the amount of power they would have over money if/when they adopt crypto money and smart contracts.   Lets just hope that government 2.0 is more responsible than the current ones.

TLS is all about exchanging certificates for the purpose of securing a communications channel.   Read the step by step flow.
The pubkey auth flow has nothing to do with securing a communications channel.  
Here's how simple the pubkey auth flow is.
Give the website your public key to create an account.  You then sign a message using your private key and send it to website via a form or even a browser extension.  They check the digital signature using your publickey.  If it checks out, a logged in session is created and you're good to go.  All communications flows over standard https.   It's dead simple, impossible to break into and does away with usernames and passwords.

Comcast does the same shit.  They'll sneak in extra fees because most people autopay whatever amount they request.  If you setup push payments(ala Bitcoin, or reoccuring payments at your bank) of a certain amount, then when they magically increase the bill, a much larger percent of customers will be arguing with them about why.  
It comes down to who has the leverage.  If they already have your money then it's hard for YOU to get it back.  If they request more and you say NO, then fuck em.  They'll have to do the extra legwork and it will cost them more money than it's probably worth in the end.
I would tell them to send it to collections and then fuckoff.   I'll pay pennies on the dollar for that fee in the end and they'll lose a customer.

You already gave them a shit ton of money in fees.  Probably way over the amount you're being refunded.  You pay for it with EVERY SINGLE PURCHASE over your entire life time.
Maybe you think that is a fair trade off, but lets do some math.
** Updated math.  
Example,  if you buy $30,000 a year of stuff using your creditcards, with a fee of 2% = $600   Adjust the numbers and add that up over your lifetime of purchases and you have an idea of what it costs to use credits cards and cover fraud.
Surcharge figure came from here.


This shows a $2 surcharge fee.

Even if you mine at a loss today, with a 25% price increase you'll suddenly be in profit.  Of course the opposite is true.  
My point is that mining is not simply a break even calculation on todays price.  
Miners are speculators too.  Each speculator has a different ROI horizon.  Some can stick it out for 3 months others 18 months.  It all depends on price.

Ripple isn't decentralized and the creators are SELLING the coins that the generated out of thin air and are distributing them as they see fit.    
If you don't care for a zero trust system, then Ripple/Stellar are fine.  They are essentially the postal service for money.  They sell you stamps, so that you can send value to another trusted party.  
Ethereum doesn't exist.
Bitcoin is very different from those systems because it's zero trust.

He's actually correct.  All of your coins move from that wallet the instant you send it.  The remainder is sent to a change address.  Which coins moved?  All of them.  The previous inputs are rejoined into new outputs for the transaction.  So there is no guarantee the *oldest* coins where the ones that were spent.  IRS doesn't care either way.  You just have to pick an accounting method and stick to it.  If you claim FIFO and show them records, then you're good.

He revealed that Overstock was in the early stages of looking at the legal propriety of dual listing on NASDAQ and another stock exchange. While they have not ironed out any concrete plans, he said:
    “We could either issue securities in bitcoin and translate those and collect funds in dollars. I am less interested in that than just taking it and listing it and maybe even creating a new security and issuing it through such an exchange. Or we could take our security, which is already publicly registered and publicly traded and just get it dual listed on somebody’s technology.”

There are so many variations crypto-currency right now that one of them should be showing signs of challenging bitcoin, but they haven't even came close. 
If you're ok with centralization there's Ripple and Stellar,  If you like inflation there's dogecoin.  If you like your coins to erode over time there's Freicoin.  If centralization of mining worries you there's x11 coins. If you want to be annoymous, there's Darkcoin.   Then there's all the "2.0" coins like Mastercoin, Counterparty, Ethereum, etc, but again they have zero network effect and/or piggyback on Bitcoin anyway.  
The fact remains that none of these have any features that challenge bitcoins dominance .  They may live side by side, but they don't diminish Bitcoins value proposition.  This is because the underlying tech is simply a global ledger with a fixed supply of units which act like hard money.    
NONE of the others can compete with that.  Bitcoin is so simple because it does just enough to make itself useful and valuable at the same time.

In addition to slowing consumption and cheap products, it would suddenly recreate the incentive to repair instead of replacing your durable products. (Refrigerator, Washer, Dryer, TV)  This may also force the manufactures to build better products that last longer... You know.. Like the good ole days.  There's a reason old folks always say "they don't make it like they used to".   Quality craftsmenship has gone out the window.
It would also end minimum wage adjustments made by the State.  If your base currency is increasing in value, then your employeer is going to have to have a 1:1 talk about lowering your wages because of deflation.  That would create a very interesting dynamic.  
Say you work some place 1 year and Bitcoin has appreciated 10%, which results in in essentially a 10% raise, all things being equal.  You're employeer then needs to come to you and give a reasons why you're not worth it.  Assuming you're doing a good job, you should have more leverage than today.

Scrypt has a more decentalized network than bitcoin, but with ASICs, it will centralize the same way bitcoin has. These machines are far more efficient, so GPU miners will be out of luck and have to switch to the next most inefficient algorithm.
You'll basically have to run the most inefficient algorithm that can't be optimized by ASICs to keep a coin decentralized.  OR the cost of ASICs will eventually drop b/c the technology will be maxed.  Another words you can't scale up anymore.
Once this happens anyone should be able to buy a super efficient ASIC and get a small portion of the bitcoin block reward pie.  It's still going to be proportional to how many units you have, but you'll have to scale out instead of up.   Scaling out is how scrypt has been, but it's going to start scaling up, with these ASIC advances.   Eventually Bitcoin will plateau and everyone will have to scale out again.

I wonder how you would convince miners to merge mine your sidechain.  Seems like you would have to pay a fee for the extra overhead that MAY cause them to loss out on the next block.  We already see miners optimizing their operations to only take powers of 2 number of transactions for some odd reason.    Greedy miners may not be interested in sidechains when they're all about the block reward.

I can't believe you are asking this with such assurance.
The incentive is that better roads equals more efficient trade.  Which equals more money and the ability to reinvest and further the transportation network.  Pretty fucking simple.  No government required.  Do you think a government carved out the Silkroad in China first and then trade was established?   No!
In fact, many of today's highways are based on old wagon trails that were carved by the pioneers in the 1800s.   Railroads were created by private business too, not government.
You're clueless if you honestly think everything would stop if the government stopped.

Colored Coins is one method.  I think CoinPrism is the platform that lets you do it.   I think Havelock investments is another.

I've pondered the possibilities of having taxes built into the protocol that go directly to known accounts (Transportation, Charity, Defense, etc).  The taxes would have to be legitiment as 51% of the miners would have to agree to accept it. Essentially voting. 
Not sure how this could work internationally though.  Maybe download a custom client for your Government and the taxes are automatically deducted on every transaction.    Just spit balling.
It's an interesting concept, but I doubt it will catch on, because people don't like taxation b/c it leads to inefficient government that then has power.

I understand that. 
But only malicious miners and they also have to be the ones finding majority of the blocks to actually make a difference and force up the average.   It's also something that we would notice immediately and the community would yell from the roof tops for it to stop.  If it's a mining pool, miners that don't support this behavior would move, causing them to lose hash power.   It's self defeating.

I'm very biased here and see the world through bitcoin colored glasses.  So it's hard for me to imagine such a thing.
However, off the top of my head, it sounds like a religion if there isn't a reward other than an ideology.  What would the promise be for such a system?   
Also, if this system doesn't have a reward, then it can't be zero trust.  The selfish battle for the block reward and fees is what secures the blockchain.  
Without that, you have to trust people/institutions.  Ripple and Stellar are the "trusted" crypto coins, but they're a true scam.  The creators hold majority of the coins and the distribution method.  They are the "Fed" of their coin.  Also no "work" was put into the system, so it doesn't have as many stake holders and thus weak network effects.

 It doesn't have to be fiat any longer it's about value transfer.  Bitcoin is internet money and it's the easiest way to send value around the world.  The path of least resistance will win.  There is no doubt about it. There is always going to be a market for that.   I may buy a videocard from some guy in canada.  He could then purchase beefjerky with his bitcoin. or whatever.  The network is large enough today to sustain itself.   Meaning that if you have bitcoin you can find someone else who wants it for legal goods or services.    
USD is still used in places where it's been deemed "illegal" to buy and sell legal good and services.   Just because they make the means of value transfer illegal doesn't automatically make everything thing you buy and sell illegal.

@_date: 2014-12-21 20:14:27
Not sure if you got an answer for this in the past, but here's my take on it.  
You have to calculate the existing cost to run the entire US monetary system.  Including all banks, CC processors, fraud, insurance, etc...   This includes millions of employees, office space, electricity, etc.  
Bitcoin is starting from scratch and even if bitcoin is at scale it would be cheaper than our existing system, especially when comparing the perpetual cost of fiat inflation for the entire world since inception.

That makes no god damn sense.  I'm so tired of hearing that argument over and over again.  There is no way that Satoshi would kill his baby and cash out on exchanges where he would have to make his identity known.  THINK about it for fucks sake.   
Satoshis investment is not about the coins he owns, it's about the success of Bitcoin.  He is not going to jeopardize something so important to cash out to fiat and put the chains back on.  Satoshi spent years building Bitcoin.  He built internet cash!  If you don't understand how important this is then you need to seriously pick up a book.  I recommend Sovereign Individual.  Or just Google for internet cash and read some white papers that people have wrote about this subject over the past 20 years.  
It's amazing what he created and we have the source code, so NO we don't need to know anything else about him.  PERIOD.

Microsoft is embracing opensource, which is a complete 180 from their tradition.  So the fact that they took a gamble on bitcoin is no surprise.   The new CEO is shaking things up.  
The conversation probably went something like this.  
dev: Hey, we should accept Bitcoin.
ceo: To the moon!
The big question is if they're going to build it into other products.    Microsoft is the king of APIs, so I wouldn't be surprised if they offer a Bitcoin API and possibly use it for in-app payments.   
Bitcoin is perfect for a global app-store.  Surprised Mozilla hasn't added it yet.  The web is open and global, so is bitcoin.  Embrace it already.

Bitcoin is freedom from Inflation.  It's freedom to send value to anyone in the world for any reason, no questions asked.  It's freedom to store your wealth away from all existing government entities.  
Freedom to exchange goods is at the root of our civilization dating back to the very beginning of it all.   Gangs/criminals/barbarians gave rise to governments and banks because we needed a way to protect our wealth from being stolen.   Governments and banks have gone too far though and now they try to exploit us at every turn with fees,taxes,tariffs,inflation and restrictions.   With Bitcoin, we no longer need their protection or permission.  We have the tools to secure our own wealth.  This is freedom!  
It seems that only a few people in understand this.
@_date: 2014-12-07 21:21:31
Their entire job is to beat inflation.  (AKA unlimited printing of fiat money)  If they don't beat inflation then they fail at their job.

Larger the block, the larger the potential orphan rate.  It's all about propagation and how many transactions are floating around.

Fiat is guaranteed by design to loose value.  Everything you choose to do to avoid this is an investment.

Hot potato is when no one wants bitcoin because its decreasing in value.  So even if Overstock paid one other merchant in BTC, that merchant will probably sell for fiat.  It all depends on how many hops it makes before it is cashed out because someone can't handle the risk.

That's a really good point about incarceration and bankruptcy laws.  Before 1970 a congressman could vote against such things in privacy and not be labeled as being "soft on crime" or "against poor people".   They could vote against laws based on larger principles such as free market, free choice, small government.   These days, everyone in office is meant to have something to say about every little issue that comes up.  And if they don't take a stance on it or vote against it, they are directly called out in public and ridiculed by the media for it.

Mastercard could technically create a chain they control but what hashing algorithm will it use? It has to be a new one that no one can efficiently mine yet.  Otherwise it will get torn apart with 51% attacks. 
Who will choose to mine it?  How many coins will Mastercard own?   Are these units actually shares in Mastercard?  Sounds like the SEC needs to be involved here.  What kind of restrictions and rules is the SEC going to force Mastercard to make?  How do they change their parameters and how transparent is it?

Patrick Byrne from Overstock.com hired the Counterparty team to build a crypto exchange.  He also wants to be the first company listed that has a crypto version of stock.
Reddit expressed interest is creating crypto shares that represents about 1% of the company.   Imagine tipping each other on reddit using real reddit shares?  Pretty awesome.
Once this happens in a few places, the advantages will become very obvious and more companies will follow suit.   Crypto stock allows for global ownership of public companies.  They can even issue dividends, allow voting, etc.  
Currently my investments are locked up in WallStreet because they control the large exchanges.  This keeps US financial prosperity locked inside of the US.

You are very wrong on this one.   21 Million coins is the contract that all of us have agreed on.  Miners will use fees to pay for their expenses.  It's a floating value on PURPOSE that they have complete control over.  That wasn't by accident.
Bitcoin will never raise the hard limit beyond 21 million coins.

Dogecoin is the facepalm to crypto-currency.  The entire reason we are even here discussing this topic is because of the limited supply of Bitcoin.  Inflationary currency, aka fiat, is a destroyer of your hard work.
Dogecoin removes that fundamental attribute, which removes any incentive to invest in it.  Thus insuring its downward spiral.  Yet, the community rails on about going to the moon.  It looks like insanity to me. Yet there are 80k people there.
If they really just want a community that donates and is all for the lolz, then please kill the dogecoin chain and create a colored coin.  More of your hardwork/energy will go towards the cause and it won't inflate away in time.   Cryptos should be a value-add, not a destroyer of wealth.   We already have the State doing that to us.

Bitcoin is based on the thoughts of crypto anarchism and previous work done by others that shared that interest.

It seems like we need to implement IBLT (bloomfilters) first since it changes miners incentives and see how they respond. 
Then revisit this Blocksize limit after.  Otherwise we're "solving" the Blocksize problem before it is actually a problem and we don't know how miners will behave with O(1) propagation.
I'm just saying that we may have to revisit this issue again after IBLT is implemented.

*Rub3x's comment was deleted.   Here was my response.*


You're essentially saying that because this technology(or product) has not reached it's full potential yet, that it's a pyramid on the verge of collapse.    That is your logic.
We can take that logic and apply it to every single business that has not reach it's full potential and RELIES on the vision of it's founders to keep pressing forward until it succeeds or fails.   Everything has a starting point and it takes dedicated founders and believers to push a business or technology from the prototype stage to the mainstream.  
Every established multi-billion dollar company started from nothing and the founders had to CONVINCE people to work with them and then turn around and SELL their VISION to venture capitalist at every fucking stage.
This is the natural progression of business and technology.  
Obviously you don't know anything about what it takes to become successful.  Maybe you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth?  I don't know, but you are clueless.
 &gt; Nobody begged people to use the internet. 
Do you remember how many FREE AOL CDs came in the mail every month begging for you to come online.  100 Hours free!!! 


Yes they did, it's the same thing, Many business were sending promo CDs, dialup plans, (Juno).


Paypal (X.com) had a huge referral program that went on for years to build their network effect in the late 90s.  I referred a lot of friends to X.com and even then, they didn't see the point of it.  They didn't trust it.   Paypals success did not happen overnight.

Geopolitical events will be the catalyst and then we'll never go back to government money.   you would think that we would have learned by now.  There are numerous examples of governments destroying their money and robbing their citizens of wealth, but it's obvious that most people don't know history so they think we're crazy for saying such things.    Some of us use the internet to learn, but most use it for cat pictures.  So ya, bitcoin is probably doomed.

IMO, they're better at it, than the Federal Reserve or any other bank.  Know why?  Because it's their money!
Let capitalism rule the market, not the stupid government that spends other peoples money.
If bitcoin becomes mainstream, the ridiculous government spending will be caught off.  They'll be forced to balance budgets, because they can't inflate the currency and outrun debt forever.

Why do you want to get paid in USD?  Because it's widely accepted and everyone accepts them, right?    Once Bitcoin is ubiquitous, the crypto framework will be everywhere, allowing colored coins to flow around the world just the same.  
The train of thought is that today trading stocks is difficult, expensive and only a small percentage of the world can do it.  If Stocks are just as liquid as currencies then they will be used like currencies, the same way bitcoin is used.   If a company has crypto-stock trading on the open market alongside bitcoin, then the lines are completely blurred and they become the same thing.  A way to exchange value.

I guess it depends on the topic and the host.   The way I see it is that Bitcoin is technology, not a company.  So if you have a general Web hackathon, people are going to reach for the open standard tech. aka HTML5, javascript, css.  
They're not going to code with Flash, ASP or some other proprietary tech, unless the company hosting the event is promoting it.
So in the case of Money 20/20, open tech (bitcoin) is probably going to win because there isn't a single company promoting their APIs.  Plus Bitcoin is more exciting, not matter what.
Why are you trying to figure this out?   Curiosity or do you work for one of those companies?
@_date: 2015-05-07 22:53:58
It appears that way doesn't it.  Lightning networks and sidechains are their babies.  Don't get me wrong, I think that it's amazing technology that allows near infinite scaling, but it should not be forced on us via high costs from artificial scarcity.
Cheap access to raw bitcoin should be a priority too.  The mining markets have technology on their side to become more efficient and decentralized, let it happen.
@_date: 2015-05-15 20:24:39
The NASDAQ is using colored coins which only requires fractions of bitcoins to operate.  These types of services do not create enough demand to push up the price in and of themselves.   They're using the blockchain, not the currency.
There are other applications where the currency is needed, primarily in ecommerce.   The more market places and services (Saas) that are created that require bitcoin, the more demand is generated for large sums of coin. 
I guess you can think if it as two different use cases.  One is the blockchain and the other is currency.

Investments are a balance of risk/reward.  Nothing changes that, whether we're using an inflationary or deflationary currency.  
When a deflationary or fixed supply currency is used then the increased output of the economy through innovation and advancements are shared automatically will everyone in the economy.   No more raising minimum wage instead you'll end up with lower costs and over time lower wages, but you know what.   Those dollars that you made last year are worth more this year because the entire economy grew.  Shared prosperity.   Instead of having to work 40 years you'll probably be able to work 20 again and retire doing something you love.
Inflationary currency causes people to run around shifting their wealth from one asset to another essentially gambling at an attempt to prevent their wealth from being erroded.   What you end up with is exactly the situation that we have today.  Rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer at an increasing rate.   This is because the rich are educated and have the ability to mobilized their wealth to hedge against inflation.  The poor get left behind because they can't invest or save.  They can't afford to save and what they save gets eatten away by your lovely inflation.  Soo please pull your head out of your ass son.
Inflationary currencies are the root of many of todays problems that people are looking for the Government to solve.  If they would stop stealing our wealth through inflation then we wouldn't need all these fucking programs attempting to redistribute and correct the inequality their system created in the first place.  Its pretty fucking simple.

I think the biggest issue with your argument is that you're looking at it from a pure $$$ cost to attack the network.. You also have to consider the feasibility of building 51% more hashing power than exists at the current time along with the fact it will take a long time to build that much hashing power and get all of it online... 
At which point, are they mining? Or keeping everything offline until the time of the attack? All of this has to be calculated into your attack ROI... 
Also with recent release of 21inc slides, it's clear that they plan on socializing the cost of mining over billions of devices...We're all going to be paying for the blockchain via our own electricity.. Also these micro miner chip are going to be very efficient for their hashing power and scaled out over the entire world... It would be very difficult for an attacker to build enough ASIC rigs in a short period of time that can compete with that.

Governments would adopt a model similar to ripple.  Where they create a huge stash of coins then distribute them or sell them at a fixed price.  They would also have to buy any excess that comes onto the market to reduce fluctuations.  Its no longer a cryptocurrency like bitcoin in the sense that it doesnt need mining, its centralized, no block reward, holders are also dependent on that controlling entity not to inflate it.  Sounds like the USD that we have today.  If the government creates a coin its will water down everything that makes bitcoin revolutionary so that they can control it.   Governments need to be in 100 percent control of their local currency.

Algorithms are essentially laws written in software.  They are not politically neutral.   They can be anything.  The fact that bitcoin has a fixed supply means that it subscribed to the philosophy of hard money.  Which is VERY political.  


Why the fuck would you own bitcoin if you don't think it is going to be successful.  That's like buying Tesla stock and then shitting on  everyday.  But not only that, it would be like commenting on every post about how electric cars are never going to work.   You guys are mental and should be banned.  Seriously, you offer nothing.

So if a 1TB block is sent from a malicious miner then it means that miner has to find the block first, then literally upload 1TB to 51% of the miners BEFORE someone else finds the block too.   This is the reason some miners publish 0 transaction blocks.  They don't want to risk losing the block reward due to propagation.

Large miners are not bandwidth constrained.  They can probably run a DSL line from their mining hardware up to their pool that lives in the cloud.    The blocks propagate across well connected nodes(EC2), not remote data centers where power is cheap.
This is why the argument for smaller blocks is so retarded.  Bandwidth is already centralized in the cloud.

I never said that.  You can still use law to sue Mt.Gox for losses and maybe get a little bit back.  You can use the exact same tools that the victims of Berney Madoff used.  
But as far as getting BTC back from the anonymous crimials, who ever they may be.  There's just no way.  We don't even know if it was stolen or if Mark lost the keys yet.
I understand you're pissed, but what do you expect to happen?   Taint coins and remove fungibility?   Reverse transactions and remove all security in the blockchain and give that authority to whom?  
The whole point of Bitcoin is that there is no authority for people to go crying to to fix things.  It's up to you to protect yourself.  It's brutal and harsh but the reward is that no central authority can ever control this system.  The ramifications of this are huge and will ripple through history forever.

5 years old is accurate, but probably a misrepresentation.  Only in the past 2 years have we had convenient services that allow average Joe to buy bitcoin if they want.  It will take a while for the market to mature and for real use cases to surface which solve a business need.    I think the biggest take away is that it's still very early in the life of bitcoin.  We're still building infrastructure and onramps, so that when the Apps and marketplaces are created people can easily participate.     If you want a global payment system with no restrictions, then bitcoin is the only choice for your app.

The problem is that the queue can reach a tx/s that is higher than 1MB/block can ever empty.  Then you end up with everyone's mempools filling up and crashing all the nodes.  Bye bye bitcoin.
You have to have a large upper limit on the blocksize so that miners can use it when necessary to clear out a surge of transactions.  (payroll day, 1st &amp; 15th).  Otherwise it might take days to churn through all those transactions.

I read your blog post and still didn't understand that part.  I agree with dellintelbitcoin.
The miners select the transactions with the most fees attached because that's where they make their money.   However, they also have to balance the number of transactions they're going to include and the amount of time it takes for their block to propagate to 51% of the nodes.   There is a chance that if their block is too large, it will get orphaned because someone elses block with less transactions spread to 51% of the nodes before theirs.     
So a miners incentive is simple:  Maximize transaction fees collected but keep the block as small as possible.
   
Because of this, arbitrarily raising the hard coded block size does not change the existing incentive structure.   IMO, the hard coded blocksize limit is pointless, because the incentives already prevent spam.
HOWEVER, Bloom Filters, may change the incentives. Correct me if I'm wrong, but bloom filters allow O(1) propagation time, which means miners don't need to worry about large blocks slowing down propagation time.  Doesn't that mean that a miner could spam the network with a large block of dust, with zero ramifications?  
So if Bloom filters are on the horizon, we need a hardcoded blocksize limit to prevent spam, because the incentives are switched.
IMO, bloom filters need to be implemented first, so that we can see how miners behave on a different incentive structure and then revisit how to raise the blocksize limit dynamically to allow growth, but also prevent spam.

Let me put on my thinking cap here.   This is big challenge.  You may have stumped me.... 
Oh, wait... how about ~4000 transactions per block!
If we were running into bandwidth, data, or computing limits at 7 transactions per second, then it would be fair to use that term.  But the fact remains that those parts of the system can handle way more than we can currently throw at it.    
The only reason we have 1MB artificial and arbitrary block limit is to prevent spam and allow for faster block propagation to miners.  Once Bloom filters solve the block size propagation issue, THEN we can talk about transactions per second, because then we will be trying to optimize bandwidth, computing, and data limits.

If bitcoin becomes successful, we should have way more than 6000 nodes because they will be ran by businesses who need to access the blockchain to verify payments and send transactions.  
6000 businesses running high capacity nodes is far better than 6000 DSL users who run nodes as a hobby.

We all know L1 bitcoin doesn't scale to their needs. They will have to aggregate their transactions.. Why are you playing this up? 
@_date: 2015-05-09 07:47:17
I choose: 
1. Inexpensive direct access to bitcoin because that ensures uncensored P2P transfers.  ala freedom. (Large blocks + ~5 cent fees to ensure my transaction gets included within the next 3 blocks, maybe charge 30c for 1 block)
2. Global access to the network, because everyone can benefit from hard money that is not tied to a government. (See Greece, Argentina, etc..)(Large blocks + Lightning network where applicable)
If we're forced to use lightning networks, because direct access to raw bitcoin is too expensive, due to small blocks, then we will be living in walled gardens designed by Coinbase(banks 2.0) and governments.
Censorship can happen at the mining level to some extent, but its a free market with balancing economics. Boom and bust cycles.  Centralization during big technology/energy advances, then decentralization as the competitive advantage plateaus and profit margins shrink.   It's a self balancing system.   Not everyone can run nodes, it's not economical. However, any businesses that deals with bitcoin should run a node to ensure network integrity and to have a vote.
As far as fees, miners just need to start playing with them to see how much we are willing to pay for transactions.  We pay the default fee today, even though blocks aren't full.  Raise the block size to 100MB, and the same will be true.  We pay, because we value the utility of bitcoin.  We don't need supply restrictions to force fees.

Not really. If they(Banks,Nasdaq, BitUSD) can do all of their business within a few hundred thousand satoshis, then whole bitcoins are essentially worthless.  If we keep the blocksize at 1MB and push everything to level 2 bitcoin, then I think we may end up inadvertently building a Ripple like system.
Individuals on the bitcoin-dev mailing list have talked about creating assurance contracts for miners.   These contracts don't have to be Bitcoin,  they could be BitUSD.  This means the value of the native token could go down substantially and miners can still be funded.   
If it's too expensive for the average Joe to do L1 bitcoin transactions then there is no need to hold them.  They'll hold BitUSD instead and transact on L2.
Is the 1MB restriction going to kill the Bitcoin that we know today?

Exactly, anyone can sit around with their thumb up their ass talking about what ifs, but when you digest the current landscape, momentum and how much of a breakthrough Bitcoin is, it's obvious that it's going to take some time to come up with something better.

Sure, it would cause a little centralization in the cloud, which where all of this is headed anyway.  But there's a different type of centralization that occurs if we can't afford access to the raw bitcoin.
Centralization is when you have to use a Coinbase lightning network because it costs $100 to perform a single bitcoin transaction on your own.
Centralization is when Hive Wallet and many other small wallet providers close up shop because they don't have enough customers to create a lightning channel with enough transactions to pay the fee to record the transaction in the blockchain.  
Centralization is when giant banks run lightning networks with millions of transactions in them and requiring KYC signatures on all transactions.
Congratulations, you have build banknet.  Please sign over your freedom at the nearest approved lightning network provider.
Running a bunch of tiny nodes around the world isn't going to be worth shit, if you can't afford to send transactions on it.

Ripple isn't even block chain technology.   It's a centralized service that just so happens to allow other computers to help come to a consensus, but this is in no way required.  Ripple owns and controls the entire system.  They can shut it down, censor it, and get sued.   They are ultimately liable for any thing that happens on their network.  They claim that it's distributed, and resilient, but it's not.  It's bound to go the way of e-gold or Liberty Reserve if illegal activities like money laundering happen on the network.
Bitcoin and real blockchains are not centralized.  They rely solely on network effects to succeed.  If bitcoin continues to work, then it will be unstoppable because you can't hack the head off.

There are "frictions" in both environments.  It just depends on the initator and who benefits by taking no action.
If you're making $15 per hour and your employeer comes to you and wants to reduce it to $12 per hour, the employeer needs to have a good argument why after X time the employee isn't worth it.   
My argument is that experience should be rewarded.  In an inflationary environment the employee has to start the conversation and justify the raise.  With deflation it flips the dynamic and makes it easier for the employee.

If a publicly traded company chooses to issue colored coins, then value should be backed by respresenting ownership in the company.  Same as common stock.    So the value of a colored coin of company X should be equivalent to their share value.     
The awesome thing about representing shares as colored coins is that it allows p2p stock transfers.  Imagine buying an xbox game from a friend in exchange for 1 share of Nike that was given to you as a birthday present.

Increasing the max block size doesn't magically increase all blocks, it only means that miners can choose to fit more transactions into a single block IF there are lots of transactions pending.    But the responsibility is still on the miners.  They can choose t include zero transactions if they want, but they can not include more than the max block size.   Maxblocksize is a lame artificial limit that should be removed completely.

The economics will prevent P2P transactions.  That's what you guys seem to want!  You want small blocks, to increase fees on a per transaction basis, which forces everyone to use payment channels.
Am I supposed to open a channel between me and my buddy for a couple transactions?   If it costs $10 to close the channel a month later as a blockchain transaction, then P2P transactions are dead.
We should have used Coinbase.
I know that there are special use cases where payment channels are the way to go, but we should not ignore the P2P use case, because that's where bitcoin derives it's power.  Otherwise we should just use Ripple.

He was talking about hardware, so that's what I was referring to.  Everything else that you mention are protocols that run on lower levels of the OSI stack.   Similar to sidechains running on bitcoin.
I agree that alt chains can and do provide value, but there is no reason for them to be segregated from the Bitcoin network.  I really like the idea of sidechains.  Sounds like the perfect solution for innovation that doesn't cannibalize Bitcoins marketcap.   I'm so tired of these pump and dump altcoins.  These sidechains should usher in a new period of real innovation that supercharges the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:07:37
Lets do some math then.
Current has rate is 155,085Mh.   Favorite bitcoin mining GPU is ATI 7950 which does about 500Kh.
155,085 / .5 = 310170.   
So about 300,000 video cards are being used for mining right now *ONLY* on litecoin. That doesn't count all the other Alt-coins.  
A new Titan ASIC does 100Mh.   They just sold 2000 of them.   That's an extra 200,000Mh being added to the network in a few months.   That's a huge increase in hashing power and means that those 300,000 GPU are going to be making about 1/3 as they do today.
So yes, I would say there is gonna be a firesale on video cards in the next few months.

You need to rethink everything if you're still trying to apply that principle to bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not an IOU.  I own bitcoins and they are debt free. 


You are describing perfectly why our system is completely broken.  It's more absurd that you think this is how it's supposed to work.
The current system miss-prices debt and risk.  It's all based on a giant confidence game that is not sustainable.  Countries are using negative interest rates and talking about banning cash, all so that they can keep the game going.   Debt as money eats itself over time.  That's why rich people get rid of it by buying gold, homes, art, etc.


500 years ago, they didn't have computers, infinitely divisible units, perfect global communication or access to social networks(trust/reputation).   The system that they create worked ok for the time being.  But it wasn't fair.  The original banking families ended up owning the world over, by using fractional banking.   They stole 100x everyones hardwork and built/bought every thing of value they could.
So we're not traveling back in time.  We're able to create a new financial system that is more efficient and provably fair.  Many won't like it, because it flips the current system on its head, but a fixed unit monetary system, combined with p2p microloans will completely rewrite the rules of finance the same way napster upended music distribution, and the internet changed communication.

We can create 1000 transactions per second and the "network" can handle it just fine.  The issue is that it will take time for all those transactions to get included into a block.  We can only fit about 4000 transactions per block.

Here's proof.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:29:54
From the sidebar:


Running your own node means that you don't have to rely on some other node to send payments and receive payments.   There's also privacy benefits, along with enforcing the consensus (validation) and 21M coin limit.

We saw what happened when GHash got close to  ~50% hash power and how everyone yelled from the top of every forum they could for miners to moved their hashpower elsewhere.  Everyone seems very aware of this problem, plus I don't believe they will act maliciously.   (sans 0 confirmation satoshi dice incident).  


I wish I took screenshots of the hash rate distribution changes over the past 2 years.  It's pretty clean how it's going to play out.  Mining centralization only occurres temporarily because of a rush of VC money into the space, prompted by a huge run up in price.   Technology, energy and bandwidth are always becoming cheaper and we all know that that makes hashing power more accessible.




No, not miners.   I'm talking about who opens the payment channels for us to use and in addition, what rules we have to follow within their channel.  
If Coinbase is required to open a channel so that I can transact, then they can just as easily deny my payment to a darkmarket, for example.  As a counter argument, you can say that Coinbase already does that today.  I agree.  The difference is that today, I have alternatives.  
I can send money from Hive wallet, using raw bitcoin, because it is cheap.  If everything is going through payment channels for block efficiency sake and cost, then it will be too expensive for anyone to transact outside of approved channels. Sounds like Banking 2.0 to me.  We will lose our freedom to send money to anyone we want, because it's too expensive. 
I've seen what is possible with chain analysis and it seems pretty clear that whitelists are coming soon.   In addition, it looks like payment channels are the perfect place to implement transaction filtering.  I don't see why you can't implement even more logic and establish rules between parties.  Tariffs and taxes 2.0.
You can argue that the same can be said about miners being able to filter transactions.  However, their incentives are not aligned to do so.  The instant that miners starts filtering transactions for political reasons, will be the day that we switch to P2P pool to ensure our freedom.


Of course they can't take your bitcoin if you control your keys, but if 99% of your money is IN Coinbase, because you have to use payment channels, then it's the same thing.  They (Coinbase+pressure from government) can seize your funds at any moment.   Where's the freedom?   
We have to have cheap access to raw bitcoin.  Payment channels are centralized points of control if you can't afford to transact without them.

Good points, but just because the ceiling is raised, doesn't mean the blocks will instantly fill up.  It will be gradual.
I think what everyone needs to realize is that your personal node has no political power.  
Exchanges have power because they provide a market to all the coins that are created on a given fork.  Bitpay has power because they process payments for a given fork.  These companies already control the market and are the reason we have trading liquidity.  
So even though we have the ability to run a bunch of nodes at home on DSL, we don't matter.   All it takes are the miners to create blocks &gt; 1MB and for exchanges recognize and sell those coins and your little node will be left behind on a fork that does not matter.

Sure, we'll be using IOUs again, but that's the world that we live in.  It also seems like the Blocksteam guys are not only ok with this, they are actually planning for it to play out this way.

True, but that will plateau.  Eventually advances will be inline with other technology (cpu,gpu) and we'll have to scale out instead of up.  Which is exactly what 21 Inc plans to do.   Millions of devices, versus, thousands of large scale ASICs.   
I think ASICs will still be more efficient, but their market advantage will be eroded as profit margins are reduced.  One operation running at peek performance requires lots of capital, and has a defined ROI because VCs want to cash out.  
Millions of users spending some electricity at night with marginal return isn't going to be that big of a deal.  The users aren't looking for high ROI, because the price of their device is probably subsidized by manufacturers trying to gain market share.    It shifts the incentives and costs around.   We all know that mining equalizes and margins go to zero in the long run.  21 inc effectively socializes the cost.
They are also building open technology and chips that can be added to many different devices.  This means companies don't have to be professional miners, they just have to buy a few batches of chips to embed in their devices so that they can talk to the blockchain and be part of the IoT (which is mostly a gimmick at this stage).  However, if the gimmick allows them to push mining into the mainstream and undercut large mining operations, then that's a good thing right?   
The only thing I'm worried about is all of this mining power being pointed to one pool.   I'm not sure how much market share this is going to represent.  I doubt it will come close to 51%, but it could be 20-30%.

You are still going to have to wait 45 minutes for confirmations no matter how many blocks are created.   This is because the secureity comes from the amount of work that is done, not the number of blocks created.   so whether we have 45 blocks or 4 blocks in 45 minutes, its the same amount of work that is securing the transaction that has to be redone for a double spend to occur.

I've been reading about them and asking questions and you can absolutely create programmable conditions inside of the channels.   That's how they work.
So, I extrapolated out and tried to imagined what they may look like if its really expensive to commit a single transaction to the blockchain.
Imagine $20 transaction fees.
Who do you think will open a channel for you to use?   Technically, you can open one, but do you foresee doing 200+ transactions in your channel to make it worth it?  Probably not.   That leaves entities like wallet providers, exchanges, ecommerce and governments to create them.   Essentially, they must aggregate together huge chains of transactions and settle on the blockchain.  That's the only way to solve the scaling issue using small blocks.  Raw bitcoin essentially becomes a settlement network that is too expensive for you to use.
My conclusion is that you won't be able to donate to Wikileaks, because Coinbase, who has been closing accounts on people who that use darkmarkets, wont have them on their whitelist, due to government coercion.
The governments are moving into this space pretty quickly and when they see that they can have a part of crafting the rules of the road, then you can bet they will.
Part of my extrapolation has to do with using chain analysis software and seeing the clusters of darkmarket activity.  White lists cans easily be built.  Some people call them green addresses.   They are essentially deposit addresses for known entities.    
It's all coming and if we don't have access to raw bitcoin, then we are locked in.  There is no escaping ubiquitous digital currency.  Everything is trackable.

Fine, lets not increase the blocksize.  Lets not change anything. The core protocol is complete!  Lets tag it 1.0.0 and call a press party announcing our wonderful payment network that can handle 3tx/s.  
Then in 6-12 months, when all the miners mem-pools are full and we're running thousands of transactions behind, we can all enjoy the wrath of real CUSTOMERS posting in asking why their transactions aren't confirming.  Of course, we'll ping all the people you list above and have them carefully explain over and over again how they must send a fucking RBF to get it confirmed. 
At that point, you can count on the price tanking, while someone scrambles to fork Dorkcoin and releases something with sensible limits that actually allows the miners to create a competitive pricing model, instead of relying on artificial scarcity.

What you're saying is that miners must make money to provide adequate security for the network.     Yes and No.
There are ways to break the relationship between token price, tx velocity, fees and hash rate.    Satoshis system is a balanced equation, if the network is allowed to scale up (eg larger blocksizes).  However, if the 1MB cap is left in place, then the economics will breakdown at some point and we might be left with an overly centralized attackable network.
Some devs talk about creating assurance contracts that miners collect at intervals.   This means the price of bitcoin could drop substantially, the fees could be low, but the For-Profit companies, who need bitcoin to be secure, will pay the miners to keep it together.
21Inc on the other hand is planning for the endgame scenario.  This is where mining is so competitive that it is no longer profitable for any centralized entity.  The cost must be socialized.  Their devices aren't meant to make money, they're meant to secure the network and spread the cost out to billions of devices and a billion users.  21Inc has the right plan for Bitcoin to survive.

I'm going to point at the internet as being a huge free market with no regulation and the ability for anyone to purchase a domain name and build a website in a matter of minutes.  It's the fastest growing entity on the planet because of this.  Of course there are many "bad" things on the internet, but the fact is that there are many more good things.   The instant you slap down regulations requiring a Forum license, E-Commerce license, Blog licence and Bitcoin licenses. innovation will slow because of the wasted energy to comply.  
The government should be used to break up monopolies, NOT raise barriers to entry.   The free market will determine which businesses survive and how many should exist.

It's funny how everyone is trying figure out how to build a market into bitcoin fees when one already exists.  
Minimum fee and Max block size are spam prevention mechanisms. They  were not meant to be used as a way to determine the actual price we pay for transactions.
We don't know how much people are willing to pay for global P2P payments, but its &gt; zero..  Western Union and PayPal built billion dollar business out of it.
Essentially its up to the miners to test us and see how much we are willing to pay.. They already give priority to higher fee transactions. They just need to explore the pricing models. 
We'll see more explicit fees after the next halving.. They'll have to figure something out when their revenue gets sliced in half.

If there wasn't a cap today, it would be impossible to add one, unless there were actually DOS attacks taking place.   
In which case, the argument for a cap would be much more clear.   It's been clouded by a bunch of different views and turned into something it was never meant to be.
It is not for fee pressure and it is not to ensure you can run a personal node on a shitty internet connection.

Right now is the time to sell your goods and services for Bitcoin.   If you look at the previous Bitcoin bubble pattern, you'll notice that they are very similar in shape to what is forming now.  I know that past performance is not indicative of future performance,  however, patterns do repeat as do economic cycles.  
Lets say that this bubble pattern is actually an economic cycle.  Right now we're essentially in a recession.  However, as the price of Bitcoin decreases to your base currency, it gives you an advantage to sell your goods/services for more Bitcoin.  This causes bitcoins to be redistributed to the people who sell essential goods and services.  The core economy.  For example, now is the time to sell your mining rig at a discount.  This increases economic activity and will establish a base to the market as transactions increase.
On the high end of the bubble the exact opposite happens.  Your goods and services net you very little.  This is when you need to take a vacation, buy some luxury items, buy a car, make capital investments or make your business more efficient . Eventually the bubble will pop and you'll be well positioned to be even more competitive doing whatever it is that you do.  
Repeat until happy.
tldr; bubbles are economic cycles, take advantage of them.

The funny thing is that the cap was meant to be a spam prevention mechanism in case of a malicious miner.  That's something we have yet to witness.
Some can argue that it's because the cap prevented any such attack, others can argue the natural incentives of the market prevented it.

My bet is on the market.

Sure, at a certain point in time, but on a longer timeline all profits will go to zero and likely negative.  That's what the adjusting difficulty ensures.  So the question becomes, who will mine if it's not profitable?   Stakeholders will or it will have to be socialized via microminers.


Whatever chips Qualcomm builds will be an order of magnitude better than the current ASICs.   The ASIC fabs will then catch up, but there 's maybe one or two more generations before die size is on par with CPU/GPU then it will plateau.

If the network grows and more transactions are done and more wealth is created within the network the price will natural rise as well.  The value of the network is that it allows global commerce without middleman using a fixed number of units.  IMO, that is bitcoins intrinsic value.  That is why we are all here.


Actually, no one is exploited in this system.  It's a transparent economy with no central control.  No entity can arbitralily control the inflation/deflation schedule and the government can't create money out of thin air.


It's not even close to socialism.  Everyone will still have private ownership and profits.    Bitcoiners will simply share a currency which has a fixed inflation schedule.  In fact, it's the absolute opposite of socialism because the State can't siliently take your wealth via inflation and then redistribute it on things like war and social programs.     
Minimum wage could also be done away with because we wouldn't have government inflation targets.  The economy would have to naturally adjust to what the purchasing power is of the currency.

They are possible though.  Just because you don't foresee them does not mean they will not become common place in 10 years.  Look at what coinbase is doing with chainanalysis and closing peoples accounts.  They're building up a blacklist.   If it's too expensive to transact in L1 bitcoin, then we are bound to the rules in L2.

So, essentially whitelists and blacklists.     
I know that I'm a little over the top sometimes, but I would appreciate it if you would read a few of my recent posts.
Basically, I think that cheap access to raw bitcoin is more important than extreme network performance with 1MB blocks and forcing everything through payment channels.  Sounds like premature optimization to me.
@_date: 2015-05-13 01:57:54
I don't think you can throw any amount of money at the blocksize debate to resolve it.  It has to be won by reason, or by market forces.(aka price is crashing because blocks are full and wait time is several days)
I think the free market will win in the long run and we'll have blocks as big as the network can support.  Even if it's pushed up initially by 21 Inc.

Why don't we have better contact with miners?  Why can't we/you ask them these questions?
It seems like they should be politically involved in Bitcoin and also be open about their tx selection process.   It would be helpful if they had Twitter feeds to broadcasts their tx fees, so we know how much to pay.
Why so secretive? 
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:17:18
You're not running the device to mine and make money, per say, you just have tons of devices that happen to have miners in them.. They switch on at certain times( off hours with cheap power) and provide hashing power to the network... Basically you won't ever care... Maybe it costs $10 a month in extra electricity, but when it's spread out amongst 500'000'000 households it really adds up to a lot of security... 
If this plays out, then we don't need bitcoin inflation or super high transactions fees to subsidize miners, we simply help secure the network with our own power. Also with the rise solar, tesla gigapacks, and other renewable energy, we can decentralize our power grids too.. The world will become more robust with decentralization.
It's pretty fucking genius on 21inc's behalf... They figured out the bitcoin endgame and are now implementing it. No wonder they have a ridiculous amount of funding.
My only worry is sending all of this hashing power to one pool.. Maybe their devices only make up 20-30% of the network and there are a few large scale mining operations around the world that run off solar or something.
But yeah, the future of bitcoin is bright.

Devs talk about fees not covering the cost of bitcoin anyway and that they need to use assurance contracts instead.   The contracts don't even have to be in BTC,  it could be BitUSD. 
I think if the economics of Bitcoin are broken then bitcoin as money is broken too.    I also see the devs making matters worse with artificial blocksize constraints and default fees.   Let the miners handle all of that.  They have the profit incentive to figure out what works.

That's the future I see as well.  I'm not sure if Blockstream members see it as being a problem though.
It appears that while they are focused on network decentralization (nodes/miners), they are inadvertently building the same system we have today using trusted payment channels and sidechains.   Same shit.
We have to have complete control of our keys and be able to afford access to raw bitcoin and real P2P payments.  If we don't have that, then Bitcoin, in my opinion, has failed.  We may as well use Ripple and register our wallets with FinCEN.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:06:11
So they just bundle a bunch of transactions together and publish it at some later time.   What if they don't submit it?   Won't that put the transaction at a risk of a double spend?   
How will the person you're paying know that you actually paid if a transaction doesn't hit the network?  How can they verify it?   Does each lightning channel creator have to create an API so that people can see if a transaction was actually published or not?   
At some point the receiving party will receive an UTXO.  How long will that take?

I don't draw the line at a fee value.  Fees are based on supply and demand. If people are willing to pay $500 for on-chain transactions, then it must be worth it.  Right?   You're not forced to use Bitcoin.  You use it because you value the utility.  The question is, how much will you pay for that utility?    
If on-chain fees become too high, then off-chain solutions will be developed.  It's all still bitcoin, and bitcoin is just crypto.

This is massive bullshit.
Look at the current mining pool hash rate charts.  We already know how it's going to play out.  Huge price run ups cause centralization, price drops cause decentralization.  Centralization only happens because of a quick competitive advantage from better ASICs or cheap power.   
It usually doesn't last long because the ROI calculation is so simple.
It bubbles, then normalizes and naturally decentralizes.  Bitcoin will keep doing this until it is running purely off of fees.  And since we have perfect competition, marginal profit should always drop to zero.  
So then the question to ask is.  Who will mine, if profit is zero?
I think there are 3 options. Business, Governments, or People.  Who has the most to gain?   Business (smoother commerce with approved parties), Government(Taxes and tariffs), People (store of value and financial freedom) 
HOWEVER, if we can't afford to do transactions on raw bitcoin, then we are bound to the rules within the payment channels, created by Government and Coinbase(central bank 2.0).
That means you don't really control your money.  The government can still pull a Greece on you at any time.
Raw bitcoin has to be cheap.

@_date: 2016-03-07 05:49:19
There are at least three things wrong with raising the blocksize by using a hardfork.
1.  It increases centralization by increasing node requirements.   Without nodes, the common user can't vote, even if they wanted to.  That's where this path leads.
2.  Getting 2x capacity increase is desired by people bitching about 6 cent fees.  At the same time people are stuffing blog articles into the blockchain because it's cheap.  Obviously there isn't enough GOOD transactions to out price that bad behavior.  (yes higher fees)
3.  It requires a hardfork, which is dangerous in the first place, but in addition, Classic is trying to activate it at 75% mining power, which means that there could be a show down between forks and people losing money.  
2MB + hardfork is the worst idea ever.

@_date: 2015-01-21 17:59:01
Sure, but we don't have O(1) propagation times yet.It's up to the miners to set their fees.   if a pool is 20% of the hash power and requires a $1 fee then you have to pay that fee to ensure your transaction is included in the next block.  If you don't pay the fee then you have a 20% chance of your transaction not being included.   Miners control the fee market no matter what.   You want your transaction confirmed asap, they want to get paid for their service.  If you don't pay up, then odds of your transaction not being confirmed go up.That is a functioning market.

You're assuming we would still be wildly in debt.  I beg to differ.  Debt has became a huge issue since the 70s with the convenience of credit cards.  Everyone lives beyond their means, borrows on tomorrow and then pays for more for it.  Again, what option do they have?  Put money in a savings account and have it loss value?  Savings is non-existent because of the Feds policies on inflation and interest rates.
You are that correct global output is increasing but wages are not.  My view is that it's because the base monetary system is disconnected from where the wealth is generated.  
Wealth is generated through improvements and efficiency.  This usually results in some sort of net increase of GDP.  With an inflationary money supply, GDP will grow, but the amount the worker gets paid will go down.  CEO gets a bonus, workers keep working.  All benefits stay at the top.   
If we were still on the gold standard, or had a magic deflationary currency we could all use, then as economic activity increased, everyone would benefit.  
Essentially increased economic efficiency and activity is forced to be reflected in the fixed supply of the underlying monetary system.   
This means everyone benefits from efficiency.  Robots doing our jobs would no longer be a big deal, because everyone would see the benefit.   You may only have to work 10 years instead of 40.   
It flips our current economic model on its head.

The "block reward" acts to reward miners for securing the network and distribute coins.  You can think of it as a bootstrapping process.  Since miners use computers, electricity and time, it eventually gave the rewarded coins value.    
At that point, a market was born and we are still trying to figure out what these tokens are actually worth.
I should add that the reward is cut in half every 4 years.  Eventually(&gt;100 years) the reward will reach zero and transaction fees will have to be enough to incentivize miners to secure the network.

Currency inflation(the invisible tax) is the issue.  Just play with a CPI calculator or take a drive.  Motel 6 is a great example.  
Hard money is a pretty obvious solution for many of the imbalances in our economy, but it was impossible to enforce.  Bitcoin makes counterfeiting impossible and it's enforced by software and a huge network of computers.   
Bitcoin also introduced provable digital scarcity.  Think of it like global DRM.   We just need software that respects it.
It's a pretty fucking epic invention.

It's not about YOU running a full node.  You live in a first world country will great bandwidth, stable currency, and tons of financial options.
I think the reason we, in the first world haven't seen bitcoins killer app yet, is because so far it hasn't delivered anything that's 10x than what the average Joe already has access to. 
If bitcoin really is digital gold, a store of value, and medium of exchange, then there are millions of people that don't have the options we have.  They are stuck in countries with poor bandwidth and shitty currency.  It goes hand in hand.     Bitcoin "could" be 10x better than what they already have.
But for the seed to be planted in those regions, we need tiny nodes, and lightning hubs handling local transactions.   It sounds far fetched, but this would be a huge success for bitcoin and a valid argument to keep nodes small.
With Core's 0.12.0 release they added a blocks only mode that reduces requirements even more.    That's the common theme among Core developers.  They want bitcoin to be smaller, more efficient and extensible.  Once you have that base, you can build all the scale you want on top of it AND maintain strong fungability and decentralization.   
Bitcoin remains the digital gold we all want, and the payment layers will be built on top.

I agree that it's difficult, but at the same time, look at 21inc's node map.  There are nodes in Venezuela, Argentina,etc..  So it's possible today.  If we double node requirements I'm not sure if they can survive.    Once LN is working, I can imagine hubs developing in those areas to handle localized transactions.     That's a business opportunity in my book.  Their local currencies are complete crap.

I would hire social media experts to taint the publics' opinion of it.  No need for real journalism, cheap 20cent bloggers spam is good enough.   Rumors are more powerful than fact.
I would also buy cheap coins through p2p markets at every drop and then resell them at the top of a rally on the exchanges, ensuring that the downtrend continues.
As a hedge, in case this crypto fantasy materializes,  I would create a few research panels to investigate the technology for government use.  Any findings would obviously be biased against bitcoin.
I would also ensure that regulatory agencies create vague and difficult to follow regulation to slow things down.
If the technology doesn't seem to die, then the final straw is to outlaw it the instant there is any evidence of terrorists using it to move money.  It's a threat to national security and is therefor illegal to use.
At this point the price should be so low that I can create a secret batch of ASIC miners for a fraction of price of today and 51% the blockchain to death.

If that were true, hashrates should drop immediately after every difficulty increase, as it's no longer profitable to mine.  But we don't see that.  We see a spikes as new hardware come online, followed by a difficulty increase, then a gradual reduction as the unprofitable slowly turn their equipment off.

It's because at the end of his augment he promotes gold.  In honesty, gold has performed way better than bitcoin this year.  However as time progresses and bitcoin utility increases, there is no doubt that the price will increase with demand.  There is a possibility of bitcoin surpassing gold because golds utility never increases. It's always the same stone.  Bitcoin is a dynamic platform that has big plans to increase its utility.   If you're in computer technologies, there is nothing more exciting than decentralization.  So what would you invest in?
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:02:35


There already is one.  The min fee!
It doesn't have to be a perfect fee schedule in 100% agreement.  They just need to fuck with the odds of your transaction making it into a block and that will force you to pay more.   They don't even need a fixed fee schedule.   
Miners are the gatekeepers to all transactions being accepted.  They have plenty of mechanisms at their disposal to figure out how to make money from fees without having to rely on an artificial blocksize limit.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:59:36
I'm saying that currently users are paying fees even though blocks are not full.  They are paying because they value fast confirmations.  The question is not how will miners undercut each other into failure, its how much will people pay for the utility of bitcoin.  This is the key to appropriate pricing and mining revenue. Do you think it costs $75 a month to provide you broadband internet access?  Nope, but that is how much you are willing to pay for it because you value it.   Cost is rarely based on the actual cost to provide a service.  You don't need an artificial block size cap to force people to pay.  They are already paying fees because having your transaction float in limbo for days is not ideal in most use cases.

Lets say it's 2100, bitcoin inflation is near zero and dogecoin is 1%.  The economy is growing at 3% y/y.   
If I held 100% of my wealth in bitcoin, I would have 3% more buying power after a year.   However, with dogecoin I would only have 2% more buying power because 1% of my savings went to miners.  That sucks and there is no way I would hold dogecoin just because I think 1% creates some magic spending incentive, when there is an alternative that has the same functions.  
3% per year is a shitty return; so odds are, I'll find a better place to invest my capital.  I'll probably buy stock in growing companies, just like I do today.
The magic part about deflationary currencies is that no one gets left behind.  As the economy grows, so does everyones purchasing power.    
Central banks shoot for 2% inflation.  On the surface this doesn't seem like much, but 2% compounds year after year and pretty soon you're left wondering why Motel 6 has such a funny name and why your parents and grandparents tell you stories about how when they were young they could buy a coke for a nickle.
Inflation literally takes your wealth and savings, and gives it to the person in charge of the money supply.  For dogecoin, it's miners, for fiat, it's central banks.  
Not everyone can escape inflation.  There are many people who don't make enough to diversify into stocks, bonds, etc.  They hold all of their savings in some form of fiat.  Given that, inflation is a prime reason for the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
The government is then required to step in and redistribute wealth to "even" things out.   
Pretty amazing system isn't it.

We're still trying to get out of the "gox" bubble.  Once we hit base value and end this down trend then we should see some form of stability.  It might be a lot lower than most of us expect, but we should hit it within the next 3 months.
Once that happens and we shed the  "down 75% in the past year" headlines, then we can see how bitcoin does as a store of value.  We have enough exchanges now that a new bubble to $1200 should be a lot more difficult.  There are many stops on the way up that will take lots of new interest(money) to overcome.  Bubbles create bag holders that are waiting to unload on the way back up if they don't care for the technology.  
The other question is, what will bring in new users?  What kind of compelling apps will it take to create demand for bitcoin?  
We need more 100% bitcoin ecosystems that create value.  
Value is created when there is an exchange of goods or information.  Since Bitcoin is built on top of the information superhighway, there has to be ways to monetize these exchanges.
 
Things like research bounties, creative writing, art/media design, app stores and web apps are pretty obvious things.   What else can you think of?  I feel like we need to define these things and knock them out.  It would be awesome if these platforms were open-source but there are obvious businesses here too.
If even half of the energy was spent building these apps instead of scamcoins, we would have a flourishing ecosystem by now.

I agree with the protocol setting up reasonable constraints, but there is no way we should start whitelisting miners.  That pretty much destroys the trustless nature of the system and ends the free market of mining.  Anyone want to buy a taxi Medallion? 
As I mentioned in the comment above, you guys are treating the blocksize limit as a market creation mechanism and arguing that we must find the "right" size.
IMO, the correct size should be unlimited.  Gavins incremental doubling seems pretty arbitrary and somewhat ridiculous and after reading the thread above, he seems to think the same thing.  We simply need something to prevent malicious activity and scales with time.  That is all.   
The blocksize should not be part of the argument when talking about the market dynamics of fees and how the miners are going to make money when the block reward subsidy ends.
Fees are a way to quantify the value of transaction priority.  People value their time and they will pay to ensure that their transaction is confirmed ASAP.  The miners simply need to decide how much they want to charge to cover their expenses.  Then the market will work itself out.

If fees are so high that we have to use L2 bitcoin, then we are bound to the rules defined within the payment channels.  Who do you think will aggregate payments together in channels?  
It doesn't make sense for my friends and I to open channels between each other because it will probably take a lifetime to make it worthwhile.   If each transaction on the blockchain costs $20, then we'll be priced out and have to rely on other entities.
Am I missing something?

Gavins argument is that miners are already in charge of the block size, so we can technically raise the ceiling as high as we want and miners will still build smaller blocks based on propagation time and fees.The ceiling is more of a precautionary limit to prevent "spam" transactions.

For me, it's the finite money supply.
If you look up the history of fractional banking, it dates back to around the 1500s according to wikipedia.  In my opinion it was probably early because it was based on the simple observation that the majority of people left their money in banks for security and rarely requested 100% withdraws.  Based on that simple fact, the bankers took it upon themselves to the loan it out.  Once a bank no longer holds 100% reserves they are acting as fractional banking.   The question then becomes, how much should they loan out.
The interesting thing about this is that they now have the power to fund the projects they want to fund.   Bankers vet the validity of each loan based on risk and return.  With this power, they became the gatekeepers of capital.   You had to meet their expectations to get money for your business and idea.  If they didn't like it or didn't like you, then you were SOL.   
Take at look at the Rothschild family.  They were the first banking dynasty which was born in the 1700s.  Their lifestyle and history is heavily documented.  So I'm not talking conspiracy here it's just really cool to learn about the family that setup Banks for most of the governments that are still present today in Europe.  They found that lending to governments was way less risky than lending to people.  Governments were very low risk borrowers and would rarely default on their loans because they have tax payers.
The Rothschilds are the perfect example of how much wealth banks acquire by being in control of the money supply and running fractional reserves.  Their name is spread all over the modern world.
I mention this history, because Bitcoin is the first thing to challenge this model in over 500 years.  
This model of Bank &gt; Debt &gt; Government &gt; Taxes &gt; People.   
I'm not saying Bitcoin is going to change this system over night or anything.  I'm simply stating the fact that Bitcoin's fixed money supply puts an end to instant wealth creation at a flick of a pen.  It means that if I own 0.0001% of 21 million bitcoins, I will always own that many.  That is powerful, especially when everything else on the internet can be copied, bitcoins can not.

One problem is that bitcoin doesn't know the price.  The other is that distributing coins based on transaction volume is just adding another magic number to the system that folks will want to tweak to fit their view of an efficient monetary system.  Each change would result in a fork/altcoin.  Stability will come from the swaps and derivatives markets.

Chip manufacturing tech plateaus after a while as does performance.   So we're not going to see a large gains in hashrate for each generation of ASIC like we saw in the past.   
21Inc, is going to be using top of line fabs that build the same processors that are in our phones.   So they will be building the most efficient ASICs on the plant for their first batch of chips.  KnC and other small batch ASICs manufactures aren't going to be able to compete with that.  They roll out a meager 10,000 units.  All in hopes of being the first to market and to have the short lived competitive advantage to mine more coin, while their competitor finish their own 10,000 units, which brings everything back into balance.   Their advantage doesn't last long.   And it's because everyone is marching along the same trend we saw with CPUs.
ASIC performance is going to follow the same trends in that graph... it will plateau.  Once it plateaus, then all operations have to scale out massively instead of up.
Given this fact, think about how CPU cycles are distributed around the world on a per device basis.   20 years ago, it was all desktop and mainframes.   Today, are their more CPU cycles available in mainframes, desktops, or mobile phones?   The scale of many small devices wins.   The trend is clear.  This is what 21Inc is planning for. 
Over time, 21Inc's devices will undercut for-profit mining operations that have to pay for power and house their large scale mining operations. 
The funny thing is that 21Inc is not looking at competing with existing miners.  They don't have to.  They just want to roll out a lot of devices that secure the network and distributes this cost across a billion users.  
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:14:50


Yes, miners are the gatekeepers and you will have to pay their fees to send transactions.   They are being nice for now because the block reward is a bootstrapping mechanism of coin distribution and mining subsidy. 


Of course you can defect, its a free market, but what percent of blocks do you mine?  It's always an odds game because finding the next block is a lottery.  What are the odds that I can get away with not paying the top tier fee and still get my transaction in the next block?   That is the question users have to ask.  As long as that calculation exists then we have a functioning market.  
Miners will have to charge a fair market rate for the service they provide otherwise no one will use it(if its too expensive) or they will go out of business(too cheap).
One can use the defector argument for all competitive markets.   It boils down to the price to provide the service.   For bitcoin, security(hashrate) and confirmations are the service.   Miners must raise X in fees to cover the network costs, otherwise the whole thing collapses.  


Your assumption is that fees will go to zero without artificial block scarcity.  I know this argument.  You guys have been using it for ages.    I think the perfect rebuttal is to just look at the fees market today.  We don't have full blocks and people still pay fees because confirmation times are important to users.  They are willing to pay for it.  All you have to do is uncap the blocks so that miners can create their own buckets the way they see fit.  This will increase throughput and allow miners to be responsible for pricing confirmations competitively.


Hmm, maybe it's Price/Priority?   How much will I pay for **certainty** that my transaction will be confirmed in X blocks?


No, it's that price because that is what you are willing to pay.  If you were only willing to pay $1 for overnight service anywhere in the US, then that service would not exist because it would be impossible to achieve.    For bitcoin, costs are heavily subsidized, but fees will have to replace them.  If no one is willing to pay $X for next block confirmation, then speedy money transfer must not be that important to them.   If they value it, they will pay regardless of the negligible marginal cost of adding one additional transaction to a block.  
Remember how expensive text messages used to be?  Even though the marginal cost was near zero, they would charge 50 cents, because that's what customers were will to pay.


Good argument. There are real costs to logistics as there are real costs to securing the Bitcoin network.   It is up to the miners to figure out how they can provide us the service of secure and fast bitcoin transactions.  Putting an artificial cap on the blocksize does not help them achieve this.  They simply need to enforce rules that will incentivize their customers to pay their fees to get the service they desire.   That is all there is to it.

I agree for the most part.  My argument is that in time apps will surface that require bitcoin.  You'll stumble across bitcoin paywalls and other services that require it.  That's the only time you'll need it.  But once that happens and all the onramps are in place along with hedging options it should be more appealing to use.  Average Joe will probably only need $50 of BTC per year for actual uses, but it's a start.I still love the speculators and wild dreamers in the bitcoin space.  They make it very interesting because you never know where bitcoin is headed next.   It's still growing into lots of new markets, so its way too early to write it off.

Charitable trusts. With a charitable remainder unitrust, you put $100,000 or more into a trust that pays out income to you for your life, with what’s left going to charity at your death. If you put appreciated assets in the trust—say a vacation home—you defer a big capital gains tax hit. If you’re in a low enough bracket when you take the payouts, you avoid the capital gains tax altogether.

I don't think there is anything to learn at this point because the block reward is still too big and the number of transactions is far too small.  Keeping the blocksize small in hopes of learning some valuable market fee dynamics at this scale is a joke.   
Block propagation times are interesting and we need to allow miners to build larger blocks so they can experiment with it.  If they see orphaned rates increase substantially, then we'll have a real problem to solve and O(1) solutions will be proposed next.    


Very true and that's what we're going to figure out.   IMO, we need to make it valuable first, then more stakeholders will enter the market and ensure that it is secure.  Especially if we end up with Government sidechains.


I don't think that a shortage of block space should be responsible for forcing a more efficient way to process micro-payments.  It should be related to cost.  If micro-payments cost too much to be confirmed in an acceptable amount of time, then maybe a sidechain with faster block intervals can process them for a reasonable rate.
The market can figure this out without artificial blocksize limits, you just have to give it the opportunity.

Blocks don't have to fill up to create a market.  The other limited resource at play is bandwidth.  Because of this miners have to balance the odds of an orphaned block due to propagation time of larger blocks.  Each mimer can set their own fee structure that may cause your transaction to be delayed.  You then have to pay the highest fee to ensure your transaction is a priority for all miners. This is true until bloomfilters are used to transmit new blocks.  Then the incentives change completely because propagation time becomes O(1).   odds are they will have a complex fee structures to ensure they can pay for operation costs.

Bitcoin is unique in the financial world... it is a digital asset.  Banks are passing around IOUs, so they still have to settle all those loans/assets at some point, which takes additional time.  Bitcoin can settle instantly if you place it in a multisig wallet, like Liquid.    If Banks create a crypto-asset protocol they all share then they can shuffle bitcoin too.   The difference is that you can take ownership of a bitcoin and prove it.  There's no delivery.
It is possible that groups of banks will create their own digital asset that is backed by something they all agreed on and can verify, but the odds that ALL banks(countries) in the world agree on a digital asset is slim.    Even IMFcoin wouldn't be all inclusive to the world... for everyone else, there's Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is the only digital asset not controlled by the banks... It's value is derived by the market, you can digitally prove that you own it and it can not be counterfeited.

This is horrible and doesn't scale.   You'll end up with huge queues of unconfirmed transactions that can not be cleared no matter how much money you throw at the miners.    
At that point bitcoin will essentially be a failure and a laughing stock because it does not scale.


Why don't we let miners figure this out for themselves instead of trying to predict how they will handle each halving. 
Miners have the choice to include a transaction or not.  **They are the gatekeepers.**  That means miners can setup a fee schedule that you'll have to adhere to if you want your transaction confirmed a reasonable time frame.
For example, miners could charge $X for 1 block, $Y for 2 block, etc...   This allows them to price the confirmation times according to the urgency needed.   How much will you pay for 1 block confirmation, vs 2 block confirmations?
If you uncap the blocksize limit, it gives miners more freedom to figure how to make fees work for them and offset the reduction of block rewards ALONG with increasing transaction throughput.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:05:22


Sure, nothing is stopping them, but if they keep undercutting each other they will be cannibalizing their profits eventually too.   
Miners have two jobs,  secure the network and process transactions. 
If they don't charge enough in fees on transactions to ensure the network is secure(hashrate) then bitcoin fails.    If miners can't figure out a way to make charge for these services and stay in business, then bitcoin fails.  It has nothing to do with artificial scarcity of block size.  
They must charge for their services.  The question then becomes,  how much will you pay for their service REGARDLESS of blocksize capacity.
It doesn't matter if they can fit 100,000,000 transactions per block.   They must charge you a sufficient fee to stay in business and my bet is that people value fast block confirmations and will pay.


This is bullshit.  It will only approach zero if users don't see value in paying fees.
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:42:23


Fees will fund POW security and miners will have to ramp up fees regardless of the blocksize limits.   Odds are they will create fee tiers.  Currently there is a min fee which gives you pretty high odds that your transaction will make it into the next block.  If you don't pay it, then the transaction floats in limbo until a nice miner decides to include it.  People pay the min fee, because they value fast confirmations.  This is proven.
If I was mining and had an operation of scale, I would charge $X for 1 block, $Y for 2 block, $Z for 3 block, etc.   Of course I don't mine 100% of the blocks, but these are the rules for MY blocks.   If my rules are known, then people will have to consider the odds of me winning the next block and if they should pay my fee or not.
The question is, how much will you pay for confirmation certainty?   That is the market.  
Not artificial blocksize limits that reduce transaction throughput and con us into paying more because only 10 transactions will "fit" in our arbitrarily little bucket.
Imagine payroll days.  The 1st and the 15th of every month there will be a huge number of transactions pushed into the network at once.  If we have limited blocksize, it doesn't matter how much money you throw at the miners in fees, they can only process enough transactions that fit into a block.  That is a complete waste of available resources and could result in days of backlog.


Everything has always boiled down to two things.  Spam and market incentives for fees.


Inflation?   Nope, miners will get funded through fees.  There is no reason to subvert the entire currency via inflation.




Time.    Not bytes.   
I will pay more for fast confirmations the same way I pay $45 for first class mail.     I don't care if it's a jumbo jet flying my 1 package next door.  I paid $45 because I want **certainty** that my package will be delivered on time and UPS, USPS, FedEx provides that service.

that there be some fee pressure, and that blocks be relatively
consistently full or very nearly full. 
Bullshiet.   That's like saying all of FedExs trucks and planes must be full to ensure that you pay their fees.  People pay for the service offered by FedEx, UPS, etc, because they value the utility.  The sticker cost is a rough estimate of the companies total cost to provide you the service when you need it, plus profits for stockholders.
If you remove the blocksize limit, you'll end up with the same kind of market.

I am listening, but you are operating under the premise that we must have an artificial limit on block size to create a functioning market.   
I'm saying that a functioning market will be born out of the end users need for ASAP confirmations.  Actually, this market already exists.   AKA min fee.  If you don't pay a fee then your transaction floats in limbo until a nice miner decides to include it.   This market is already working and we don't even have full blocks yet.
The limited resource here is Time, not block size.   And we all know that time is money.  For example, I will pay $45 for a first-class mail if it's important. However, if I'm mailing grandma a letter then I'll pay standard postage.  This same kind of priority system will develop with bitcoin transactions.  
At some point miners will probably declare that it costs X to process transactions in 1 block, and Y for 2 blocks, Z for 3 blocks.    Not all miners have to agree, but if the fees are reasonable, then the end user will pay to ensure their transaction is confirmed in some predictable time span, the same way they do today.

The issue I have with these arguments is that hundreds/thousands of miners will not shut off their equipment at the same time.   Even if their ROI turns negative.  It's a game of chicken.

Imagine if a miner demanded $100 per transaction and had 20% mining control. You are making a high priority transaction and want to ensure that it gets confirmed the next block, what do you do?All you need are a few miners to raise their fees and start to fuck with the odds of your  transactions being confirmed and the market will be born.

Sure, but it balances based on the marketcap of bitcoin.  If the marketcap is 100B, then that opens up the market to have more security.  But the additional money isn't spent solely on electricity. It's spent on more efficient chips and facilities, which results in a higher hashrate but the actual amount of electricity does not increase by the same amount.  
I'm just saying that a higher price does not result in the same increase of electricity usage.

in 20 years, but because we know how it works today, and it is not
thanks to fee pressure.
Gavin is correct here.   But the larger question is how much are we willing to pay to use bitcoin?   I believe it's up to the miners to test us.  In the past, we used to pay 50 cents per SMS message, and Telcos made billions.   What is a P2P on chain transaction worth to you?   If the block size limit is raised, miners will be in charge of figuring that out.  We'll probably see it happen around the time of the next halving.   They'll have to figure out how to replace their revenues, or go out of business.
Maybe they're liquidate their equipment and mining will become a charity operation again, like it was back in the old days when bitcoin wasn't worth anything.  At that point Peter Todds Viacoin can take over.

I thought I knew how bitcoin was going to scale.  It seemed so easy.  Just raise the blocksize, right?  I thought hardforks should be common, since it's just software.  Let's upgrade this beast and bring in the masses.  But none of the core devs agreed... This was about a year ago...  so I dug around to see what I was missing.
I don't recall what caused my epiphany, but I stopped seeing bitcoin as a payment network that needs to reach scale ASAP and instead as an odd self enforcing digital gold based on decentralized trust.   But the only way for that to be valuable is if you can run your own node.   That's where the power lies.   If you can't make sure the currency is following your rules, then you're trusting someone else.  I now run a 0.12.0 node and couldn't be happier.  I appreciate what Satoshi built.  He created bitcoin so that you and me can run our own nodes and reinforce the rules of the money we believe in.   
My thoughts on hardforks also changed.  Now I see it as an attack vector, not an upgrade path.  You don't just kick people off the network for something as lame as a blocksize increase.  If you're gonna hardfork, fucking pack it full of features that make bitcoin bulletproof for the next 100 years.
So, ya, looking back at all my arguments about zeroconf, RBF, blocksize, scaling, etc..  I didn't get it.

Because we know that we can't keep increasing the blocksize each time this happens.  Even at 2MB, it will be an issue in 6-12 months.  
The max blocksize variable is to ensure that the blockchain will not filled with spam AND that hardware/bandwidth requirements don't out grow the common PC&amp;internet connection.


You can say that about the 21M coin limit too.   The point is that all consensus rules and variables have a role in keeping bitcoin alive, decentralized and has given it a $6.5B market cap.
Scaling will come with level 2 solutions.

The price should be an upfront and known cost.  We shouldn't have to bid for a space in the blockchain the same way I shouldn't have to bid on FedEx to deliver my package on time.   Could you imagine if FedEx came back and asked for more money because they couldn't fit your package on the plane?  Extreme failure.  
Miners should tell us, via twitter, what the current price is to get confirmed within 1 block, or X blocks. 
Maybe it costs 10 cents to be confirmed in 1 block, and .001 for 5 blocks.  The price should be public.

I work with a large tech company in Silicon Valley and I would say Bitcoin has about 15% penetration of people who really get it.  If you don't see that Bitcoin is a game changer for money then you really don't get it.  The people who think bitcoin is "horseshit" are going to be eating their words sometime in the next few years.  The only thing that can stop Bitcoin is if Governments see it as a threat and ban businesses from using it.  That is the ONLY way it's gonna be stopped from mainstream adoption.  It is the path of least resistance for payments on the internet.  Everywhere you see Paypal, you're gonna see Bitcoin eventually.

A hub allows many to many relationship instead of a 1 to 1 relationship.   So you open a channel with the hub, the hub already has channels open with the coffee places, so if you purchase something, you send the payment to the hub, then the hub sends a different payment to the coffee shop.  That's my understanding of it.   
LN is trying to create a mesh of these hubs and then figure out a generic routing pattern to get your payment to go to where it needs to.   That's one way to do it, but I think there's a business opportunity in creating wallets that all connect to the same hub and then connect you to certain places you frequently shop.

Incentive might be an incorrect term for this.  
Miners can filter transactions by fees.   They can use fees to prioritize transactions as they see fit.   So fees are more of a tool that miners can use to regulate tx throughput and generate revenue.    
Fees are not a passive incentive that miners are lucky to get.  Miners have full control, the same way FedEx has full control over the prices you are required to pay for 1st class mail.

Roger sees bitcoin from the consumer perspective, Johnny understands it from a technical level.     
Roger's observations are mostly correct, however, there are real technical reasons why hardforks are not easy, why on-chain scaling is a bad idea, and why for bitcoin to handle global scale and remain censorship resistant, it must be built in layers.
Johnny and Core devs understand the trade offs and have come to terms with the pros and cons of a building a global censorship resistant network.   
The payment system that Roger wants can be built on-top of bitcoin, as Johnny mentions several times.   However, Roger is too stubborn to acknowledge this though and continues to insist on a hardfork.

Provide a reference then!  
This entire exchange could have been prevented if you presented evidence in your first comment instead of being a jerk.   
When I ran the 21BC, I took a series of advances to use the APIs before my device mined anything.  So it's pretty obvious they aren't too concerned about mining output.  Plus the device isn't meant to make you or them money, it's to provide satoshis to access the API endpoints.  Their entire model is to convince everyone to mine at a loss to have access to various APIs, which provide more utility than is spent in electricity.   I don't know how viable that is, but the point is that trying to make traditional mining arguments against 21Inc, is incredibly naive.

It's kind of funny that these pools are acting like it's the Core devs fault, when it's really themselves.   If they had a shred of common sense they would activate segwit.  It's the only path forward.  They either take it, or get forked.  Either way, everyone should be realizing that nodes are more in control of the situation, than the chinese mining cartels.

The main thing about L2 systems is that they can come and go.  There's nothing locking us into one system over another.  Centralization to some degree may occur, but you'll also be able to route around it if necessary since L1 IS decentralized.   
There's also the 1:1 capital requires for all channels.  So if a "hub" wants to support 5000 people with 1 btc of liquidity, each, then the hub must have 5000 btc locked up.     As another poster mentioned, the opportunity cost of having funds locked up might be enough of a deterrent to prevent large hubs from forming.    
A mesh might actually be more efficient in this case, so instead of having 1btc locked with 1 hub, you'll have 0.1btc locked with 10 other nodes.   Time will tell if the topology becomes more mesh like or hub/spoke like.    There's also the possibility of having a mixture of hubs and mesh.    
I think there are 5 different implementations of LN, so each one may have different topology characteristics and there's also the possibility of using lightning networks to link different coins together.  btc&lt;-&gt;ltc&lt;-&gt;eth   
So ya, lots of unknowns, but at this stage, centralization is not a worry of mine.

I'm not saying it "can not"... I'm saying it's not good enough.  Meaning, that it isn't better than any existing payment tech.  Venmo and Paypal are way better payment networks.
You have to understand what Bitcoin is actually good at and play to those strengths.   
Bitcoins advantages today is that it's censorship resistant, fungible and scarce.    These are not properties of a payment network.
If you look at Bitcoin as a payment network, it sucks.   It can't handle many transactions, confirmations take anywhere from 1min to 2 hours, IF you paid enough in fees, which is also erratic.   
Bitcoin doesn't become 10x better that the competitors until we have something like Lighting Networks.  Then bitcon payments suddenly become instant and confirmed, for any amount dollar amount (up to channel size) and for low fees.
That's the point when applications can build and chain together reliable value transfer and open up all sorts of possibilities for their users.

A better analogy might be something like a government restriction on the number planes that airlines can use to fly passengers.  Some devs think that restricted supply is the only way to get people to pay for the network.  I don't buy it though.
I pay fees today because I want my transaction confirmed ASAP and miners provide that service.  If I don't pay, then my transaction floats in limbo until a nice miner decides to include it in a block.  
Everyone values fast confirmations, the question is, how much are you willing to pay for that utility?   We don't know yet.  
We have a suggested minimum fee in some wallets, but miners do erratic things.  eg. blocks with 0 txs. 
Some devs talk about fixing this "problem" by creating complex algorithms to measure the mempool and average current fee, blocksize,etc.. all to protect the miners and ensure they have enough money to stay in business and provide the arbitrary level of security we think we need and blah blah blah.  It's all bullshit. It is up to the mining industry to figure out, because it's critical to their business.   
If we don't pay enough in fees and the network is weak and gets attacked, it's because the network doesn't provide enough utility for us to pay for it.  Bitcoin can die.. and it should, if the economics don't work.  
However, I think once we see the next reward halving we'll probably see miners begin experimenting with fees.   The main thing they need is a way to broadcast their current fee schedule.  
Here's a thought,  imagine if they tweeted their fee schedules?
GHASH.IO, 10cents for 1block confirm, 5 cents for 2 block,  3c for everything else.  
Miners don't have to agree, but you can bet they will mess with the odds of your transactions making it into the next block.
This way the miners can keep transaction throughput high and only delay folks who don't mind it.  If they pay a 1cent fee, then they are expecting to wait.  However, if they pay 10cents, they need a high certainty that their transaction makes it into the next block.  
That's why we pay a premium for First Class shipping, Western Union, and many other express services.
Free markets rule, not central planners.

Sure, but you run nodes because you want to validate your incoming payments or send out transactions without relying on someone else.
If you're taking payments for some reason then you're running a website/business.  Odds are your website is already running in the cloud.   So why not run your node in the cloud too?

The amount spent on bitcoin mining represents the lack of trust we have for each other as a human species.   If we all trusted each other and would never think about censoring someone else, then we wouldn't need mining at all.  Mining is the cost we pay for being lying dishonest scum bags that are willing to steal and censor each other at every turn.  
You are comparing the cost of a bitcoin transaction to driving 100km with no threats.  
Now imagine the cost of driving 100km through the waste lands of Mad Max with 5 billion dollars strapped to the roof of your car and no outside protection from a government which is subsidized through tax dollars.   
How far do you think you're going to get on this journey before someone attacks and steals your money?  
How much money goes into the roads, the police, the justice system(courts,prisons) etc, that allows you do get from point A to B unharmed?
The internet is its own waste land that is governed by computer protocols.  Everything is easily reproducible and open to be stolen.  We have giant centralized computer systems behind firewalls and layers of isolation to keep data safe and they're still being hacked into.   
However, somehow in the middle of this wasteland we have an open source system, that uses cryptography, and openly advertises value being transacted between anyone in the world.      
It's like seeing pallets of cash being being transported on a flatbed truck in broad daylight that you can not hijack.  It can go straight through the worst neighborhood in the world and no one can touch it.
The reality is that bitcoin provides safe transport over this global wasteland for a fraction of any other mode of value transfer in the world.  I don't have a calculator handy, but you have to account for the layers upon layers of costs that go into providing a safe physical world for all of us and our things to live in.

I understand that we locked funds with the hub for the initial channel, but the transactions that we sign later should be able to be more complex.  For example, we create a signature that requires the hub to also present a transaction that they are paying the coffee shop, before our transaction is valid.  Both transactions have to happen, or nothing happens.

It's a sliding scale of decentralization.  I don't know where we're at, but there are things which push this scale in positive or negative directions.  
Let's say we're at 0 right now.   Classic wants to hard-fork and raise the blocksize.   That pushes the scale to at least -3, if not more, because it's a contentious hardfork and they are increasing the bandwidth requirements.
Core, in contrast, released 0.12.0, which speeds up signature validation, reduces sync time and includes a blocks only mode to save on bandwidth.   They push the scale +3, because they are actively working on improving decentralization, and Bitcoin's strengths.

Everything you said is wrong.
From the wiki:
Until now, smart assets that were built on the Bitcoin Blockchain, used other Blockchains to hold the metadata or stored it in a centralized DB. Colored coins new rule engine will automatically store the metadata in torrents, where they can be freely accessed and verified. There are important advantages to this approach:
Decentralization Robustness: Even if our servers go down, the data is not lost Ownership: No one owns the data Provable immutability: A SHA-256 hash of the metadata is (optionally) stored on the blockchain. This allows our code to verify that the data loaded using torrents is indeed the correct data.

An alternative to fee estimation(dumb) and RBF is:
1.  Enormously large block size to prevent backlogs or queuing
2.  Openly publish fee schedules according to expected priority.   Just like FedEx or UPS.  It costs X to be confirmed in 1 block, Y for 2 blocks, Z for everything else.
Not all miners have to follow the schedule, but if over 30% of the network obeys such rules, it will force users to at least consider paying the premium or face an unknown delay.  Lets face it, people want their transactions confirmed ASAP, and if they want that service, they have to pay for it someday.  Eventually the block reward will be gone and we'll need a flexible pricing model to ensure miners can make ends-meat to secure the network.  You can't handy cap them with small blocks.

We can bump to 2MB and then what?  We'll never hear the end of it.  Once 2MB is tapped out, then the community will be up in arms again, raving about the fees and expecting another increase.
This congestion will happen no matter what we do.  The sooner it happens the more effort will be put into moving transactions to L2 Bitcoin.  
Core devs are focused on increasing Bitcoin's fungibility, extensibility, and efficiency.  The scalibility layer will be bolted on top of that.
The sooner everyone realizes that this is Bitcoin's destiny, the sooner we can bury this debate.

Miners have always been the attack vector, especially after pooling became the norm.   Pooling took a decentralized system, and made it very centralized, however, at least we still have our nodes.   Our nodes ensure that if one day miners decide to try and overpower us with 51% attacks or hardforking, we change the POW and render all of the equipment useless.    It seems that Bitmain and BU are attempting this very attack today.  Of course it's under the guise of "scaling", but it's really about control of their profits.   They want to scale on-chain and render all of our nodes useless, so we can't ever get rid of them.

I'm willing to bet that Coinbase will build a lightning network... what do you think their blacklist will look like?  
Look at the evidence.  
They are already blocking accounts.  Soon everyone will be forced transact between LARGE TRUSTED PARTIES via lightning networks.  Bitcoin isn't even needed then. 
What you're proposing is effectively turning bitcoin into Coinbase coin, which is backed by (The New York Stock Exchange, USAA, BBVA (Spain), NTT Docomo (Japan), Valor Capital Group, Vikram Pandit, Tom Glocer and Carlos Rodriguez Pastor)  Or even worse IMFCoin.
Good job.
Satoshi put a message in the genesis block to give Bitcoin a political meaning.    Do you think that was by accident?  Maybe you're too young, dumb or liberal to understand the political context  So I'll spell it out.  It's freedom from banks, which is just another arm of the government.  That means we have freedom from asset forfeiture without due process.
Smart contracts can go hand in hand with lightning networks, which means rules can easily be written.  Imagine pulling taxes on each transaction, or tariffs between certain parties, or whitelists and blacklists.  All of these things are enviable,  I just want to be able to opt out and still buy things with my hard earned money.


You said it.  Expensive.  It will be expensive for the common man to use, which means, we wont be able to afford freedom.
Cheers to the folks that know what I'm talking about. We are the crazies because we have political context.

He's saying that since Bitcoin isn't a liability on anyone's balance sheet, there is no guarantee that someone will buy it from you... ever.  Thus it's value is zero.
You can make that argument about everything.  If no one wants to buy your Lamborghini, then it's value is zero.   If no one wants gold, then it's value is zero.    He stated a truism, then tried to use it against bitcoin, without also comparing it to everything else in the world.   
Before that he say's its just used for drugs and speculation, which are two enormous markets on their own.  So ya, he's clueless.

Less effective?   It solves malleability, increases blocksize and adds hooks for LN and many other improvements.  It's 10000x more effective scaling solution than a block size increase.

This spec has been around for years.

It allows permissionless creation of hubs which can connect huge numbers of people for things like p2p exchanges, micro tipping, shopping, gambling, etc.   LN creates a buffer of locked liquidity that buffers smallers transactions and allowing on-chain to be more efficient.


Na, that's bullshit.   There is no such requirement.  It's up to the market to decide the size of the channels.   While in beta, the limit is $30 in LN. 


Which hypothetical entities are you worried about?   You seem to be worried about a boogey man that doesn't exist.    
LN is trustless and opensource.  Anyone can open a channel with anyone else.   If people choose to use a common node, it's because they CHOOSE to,  not because they are force to.

Yes, this makes sense.  It's been talked about for well over a year.  
This ensures L1 nodes are not centralized in datacenters and nearly anyone can be their own bank.  Since nodes are tiny, many will be able to run a LN node as well.  There should be lots of competition and routes around hubs of censorship.

It's not the # of nodes, it's wether they are increasing or decreasing in count.

There's no way that would happen. The best feature of bitcoin is a store of value.  Non-inflatable currency is a big deal.  You'll always own at least a small % of the overall network.  So a constant inflation schedule would cause the price to plummet and so would the value of the inflation that was meant to go to the miners.   It would completely remove the bottom of the market and it would go into free fall, landing some where along the lines of ripple or dogecoin.
At that point, litecoin would be better.

Replace by Fee is the natural state of the mempool, because miners are greedy.  RBF is simply a flag that says " Hey, merchant, if my tx is taking too long to confirm because of congestion, then I may send a new transaction with a higher fee."
But really, nothing in the mempool should be trusted.  That's why we have blocks.  And every time the rbtc crew mention 0-conf as being safe, they are really displaying their complete ignorance of blockchain fundamentals.

Yes, I do!  They can and will be replaced if they attack the network.  They are locked into mining sha256 hashes.  WE, the nodes, can simply change the hash algo to something else, switch the difficulty and watch their fork drop to zero, because no one wants mining cartel coin.

I learned that many people are concerned that raising the block size limit wouldn’t actually solve anything. They believe that at best it buys some time, but very soon there would again be pressure to simply raise the limit to alleviate congestion on the network. It’s important to remember that raising the block size limit does nothing to actually improve the throughput of Bitcoin. Segregated witness, the use of Shnorr signatures, lightning network, and thin blocks are real scaling enhancements. These are all important projects that need to keep progressing forward.

No, no one is saying that.  There are multiple cloud providers with huge pipes.  Pick one.  Or go with a hosting company.  
The point is that the average joe isn't going to run a node anyway.  Businesses will.  We have 6000 nodes today, most being ran by hobbyists, but in the future, there will be a lot more than 6000 businesses that run nodes for their own good and they can afford the bandwidth it takes.   It's a business expense.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:25:27
Nodes define the rules of the network.  The miners must follow them if they want to get paid.   Miners can not unilaterally change the rules of the network.  So if you're implying mining nodes will run BU and change Bitcoin, you are mistaken.

Nodes and miners hold Bitcoin together giving us a trustless settlement network (~10 minute blocks).  It's only trustless because we can run our own node to ensure that everyone is still following the rules.  That's the most important part.   
If you try to treat this layer as a payment network, we will inevitably increase node requirements (BIP101) until we are priced out and can no longer trust the network... We'll have to trust the guys in the cloud again.     Gavin was OK with this.
So no, I don't consider Bitcoin a payment network.  It's a decentralized consensus network, that we can verify, by running our own node.
From a development perspective, you don't scale this part of Bitcoin like a payment network,  you scale it like a decentralized consensus network.   The priorities completely flip.  Small nodes, efficiency, and extensibility.  Push transactions to a higher level.
Thankfully, since Bitcoin is all math, we can create some big ass equations that validate transactions off chain.  The hooks are being added right now.. and we'll be able to create some very interesting constructs on top of it to build the high capacity layer.  
I was just thinking about LN Wallets today.   
Does any of what I said help your own understanding of Bitcoin?  For me, it's been a rabbit hole.

I find that most people who don't get it, look at bitcoin solely as a currency and how well it performs that role today... which admittedly it is not very good at.  (Low tps, volatility, lack of merchant support, etc)  
What they fail to grasp is that currency is the end goal, which will take years to get there.  The foundation though is solid, but they don't understand the computer science and market incentives that built that foundation or just how scarce (and immutable) 21M BTC really is.  They think a Facebook coin can be a serious competitor.  They think, Bitcoin is the MySpace and something else will surpass it, therefor they can continue to ignore and poke fun at it.
The only way for bitcoin to become a currency is through years of price discovery (bubbles), distribution of coins and increasing network effects.
It's a journey and we're already further along that many ever imagined.

Have you thought about how the scenario will play out using Lightning Wallets ?
Here's a coffee example:  Imagine you are actually an adult and have a budget, so you give yourself $60 a month for coffee.
You simply open your trusty LN wallet, pick a coffee hub (it's connected to all popular coffee places) and this allows you to pre-purchase your budgeted amount for coffee, by locking it into the channel.  Checkout is easy, as you simply scan a qrcode,  your wallet signs it, and sends them a micropayment.

This is only the case until the marketcap gets high enough.  If the block-reward OR fees are high enough in nominal value, then it will always be worth it to create an ASIC and demolish your competition for a short time.

I don't even know how you made the jump from fees to defining what a currency is.   L1 bitcoin isn't going to be the currency layer. It's the settlement layer, because it's a bid for limited space in blocks that occur roughly every 10 minutes..  There's no way around that.   Also the $500 fees aren't just created overnight.  It's a process of people using bitcoin because they value the utility.  I don't know how much you value sending $100000 across the network.  Maybe you are willing to pay $500 if you're in a hurry.  Is that wrong?  No, it's just supply and demand.

It might have high capacity, but remember, no one is using it.  No business is going to run BU nodes, until XBT and Core is dead.   Which would take months to resolve in BU's favor.  
I see BU price spiking as r/btc and Roger Ver dump XBT for BU and euphoria erupting, then the realization that they are not the economic majority and then a mad rush back out of BU into XBT.

Segwit has it's own merits completely unrelated to LN.       We're using segwit for approximately 50% of the transactions in BTC, so it's already a success.    
LN could fail 10 times and we could rewrite it from scratch another 15 times over the next 100 years.  There are many ways to achieve scale on L2 systems. Currently it's by far the best route.   
"Just raising the blocksize" will not fly, because its risks are too high (hardfork, increased node costs, which decrease decentralization) for very little gains (temporary cheap tx).
Having both cheap fees and decentralization is pretty much impossible.   BCH,BSV will collapse under their own "success" into centralized honey pots of censorship and control.

They're rebranding their hash power behind other pools.
@_date: 2019-03-18 05:04:36


That is where the problem lies.  Which nodes see a transaction first and flag the other as a double spend?  It's a classic race condition.   I can transmit one tx to China and then double spend it near a Bitpay server (US-East AWS node).
So it is not true that nodes reject tx that have the same UTXO.  That would create a clear partition where one tx stays in China near miners, and the other stays in the US, near the merchant, without them ever knowing about the other transaction.   
The fact of the matter is that it is up to the miner to build a block which doesn't contain any double spends.  Businesses accepting 0-conf transactions are asking for trouble.

Coinbase can take your USDC at any time. Coinbase is the 3rd party, which backs the liquidity of the coin.   Read the first paragraph of the Bitcoin white paper.
USDC is about as good as Liberty Reserve, or WoW gold at this point.  I'm still surprised the US government isn't cracking down on these companies which are creating their own currencies.   My guess is that they see the writing on the wall, and think that as long as these companies can extend some form of USD into the digital realm, then it will prevent Bitcoin from becoming the new value standard.

21.co software uses payment channels and their own internal version of lightning network.  They are essentially acting as a payment hub for all of these computers.  So there are no "confirmations" to worry about.
In addition, once the real Lightning Network boots up,  you'll be able to connect to that system instead of 21.co.  Enabling a completely trustless mesh of machines and humans paying each other for various services.

It appears that Bitcoin might be resistant to tyranny of the majority.  aka Democracy.  Instead it requires near 90+% consensus to change.  
Another interesting aspect is that the lazy, the anti-social, the people out of the loop, the folks that don't activity vote, are still in a way voting by merely doing what they always did.  Even if some majority hardforks, the network will still be intact for the old users.  It might be a little slow, but their wealth is still intact.

I honestly can't imagine miners going with Bitcoin Unlimited and their pie in the sky dynamic block limit proposal.  It sounds like an absolute train wreck of hardforks and uncertainty.   Replacing that market based voting bullshit with a simple algorithm is much more akin to Bitcoins fundamentals, than introducing a huge conflict of interest into the system. e.g. (miners controlling upper bound to blocksize)

@_date: 2016-11-19 20:15:43
There are two camps in the current "debate" that is fueling all the drama.
1) Big Blocks on-chain scaling, which means that we want to try and process all transactions on-chain.  Each time transactions fees reach a certain level, increase the blocksize again.   There are many issues with this method, the main one being the centralizing effects that occur when the blockchain gets larger and requires additional bandwidth to run a node. 
Major parties in this camp include.  Roger Ver, ViaBTC (mining pool), (owned by Roger Ver),  Bitcoin.com (also owned by Roger Ver), the failed alt-clients BitcoinXT (Mike Hearn) and Bitcoin Classic (Thomas Zander and financier Olivier Janssens), and the new project Bitcoin Unlimited project.  Which wants to scale solely on-chain, by allowing miners to control their blocksize.
2) Scale off-chain, which means instead of trying to process every transactions on-chain and store it in the permanent record, use smart contracts and transact off-chain in higher level systems.  This allows virtually unlimited scaling, without the adverse effects of increasing the size of the blockchain and the node requirements.  
I feel that the majority of people are in this camp.  It's a more conservative path for the main Bitcoin network, but more ambitious, in regard to bringing bitcoin to the world and enabling innovations like lightning networks.  Bitcoin Core is the standard bitcoin client which is planning on scaling this way.  
Have a look at their release notes for the latest release 0.13.1.
A few Core developers are funded by Blockstream, which was founded by Greg Maxwell (formerly worked at Mozilla) and Adam Back (hashcash inventor). Majority of the developers, however, are volunteers and some previous releases have had upwards of a 100 people involved in it.
As you can tell, I'm biased and support Bitcoin Core.  However, as a software engineer, I can say that their code is world class and they have very high standards to ensure they don't break the $12 billion network Bitcoin.
There's a lot of nuance in both camps, as well as a laundry list of drama that has unfolded over the past 2 years.   It's difficult to unearth the truth because there are many folks spreading conspiracy theories as facts.  Plus there's censorship in both popular reddit subs that prevent a direct debunking of the bullshit. So it just keeps getting deeper.   
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:12:48
Go ahead and use it as money. Just pay the fees.  
The main problem I have with the bitcoin must be money and must be done on-chain mindset, is that you must also dilute bitcoin's security to achieve it. 
I use my bitcoin as gold, so the fees don't bother me.
Once LN activates, then I'll use it as money.

If BU actually worked within the consensus, instead of starting everything with a hardfork, then maybe, just maybe, their ideas would have merit.   But you can't simply walk into an ecosystem and claim that you have a solution IF only everyone just stops what they're doing and switches to your code. 
It's like making the claim that the internet would be 1000% faster if everyone would just switch to your version if IP.  
It simply doesn't work like that in the real world.  The fact that BU doesn't realize this, proves that they are not here to "help", they are here to disrupt, split the coin into two, and inadvertently lose people money and ruin Bitcoin's networks effects. 
 Imagine if instead of getting a working version on IP4, we kept creating backward incompatible changes every 9 months, which forces everyone to upgrade.   That's a perfect way to destroy the network effects of your protocol.  Each time a hardfork occurs you lose supporters and nodes.  See Ethereum.
 
In addition, just skimming through the issues of Bitcoin Unlimited, shows immense technical debt they are creating and they're falling far behind Core.  Look at the way they are not willing to incorporate SegWit, merely out of spite, rather than technical merits.
And here's more incompetence, by BU.


Their code is a train wreck of incompatible changes.   
These devs couldn't even hold an altcoin together, let alone a $12 billion Bitcoin network.  
In contrast, Core produces very high quality code, that is scrutinized under a microscope by very knowledgeable developers.   Just look at the release notes to 0.13.1 for example.
Or look the original SegWit pull request and the amount of review that occurred.
These are professionals and it's very difficult to compete with their level of code.
 I'm not saying it's impossible, but what I am saying, is that BU and Classic currently do not.

They're angry (Mike Hearn fan club) because we didn't want to fork.  And when they invaded with their shitily coded BitcoinXT and rampant sock puppetry and we kicked them to the fucking curb.  
They didn't get the picture with XT so we had to kick their arse 3 more times. Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, and then btc1 (segwit2x).          scroll down through each of their attacks and pure sock puppetry of fake ass nodes.
Finally they decided to create a fork (BCH) to increase the blocksize, and now they circle-jerk themselves to death over the largeness of their own blocks.   Meanwhile, no one cares to use their network, because literally every other blockchain is cheaper to use than BCH, and doesn't have the criminal baggage of Roger Ver and Fake Satoshi.

Pay 15 cents and get confirmed!   How difficult is it?
The 10-30 minute lag more likely from simple variance based on ~10 minute block times.   BU is introducing a whole new level of uncertainty and the network is essentially in a broken state until miners/nodes sort out their blocksize.   But even then, nodes will be kicked from the network if they don't keep up with the miners.   
BU is a horrible idea.
@_date: 2016-11-15 20:11:55
Spam attacks.  A miner can create a big ass block with junk and pass it off to his competitors to validate, while he marches along mining the next block.  Also the transaction fee, which is only enforceable when blocks are full, prevents users from sending dust back and forth to each other for the lolz, which bloats the blockchain.   Also cheap blockspace encourages abuses like cryptograffiti.   This just clogs up the blockchain with garbage.
Basically there is unlimited demand for blockchain space and would end up  growing into terabytes of non-financial junk use cases, if there wasn't a blocksize limit and respective fees.

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 100 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, **this results in a fee of 22,600 satoshis (0.15$).**

If we close the loop, then I could see that happening, but you still need to control your private keys, which means we require an on-chain transaction to get started.  There's also limited liquidity in LN.  Large transactions will have to be made on-chain with substantial fees for Bitcoin to be healthy.

None of their work amounts to anything unless they're able to hardfork.   It's all completely wasted unless they can convince people to run their code.  So in their mind, it's money well spent.

He's thinking about providing a convenient user experience and quoting AWS security features saying that they'll probably do a better job than an amateur running a server at home, which is probably true.   If you know how to run a server at home and expose it to the internet so your phone wallet can access it without getting pwned, go for it.

I don't believe it's correct.  
From the Ethereum home page


Ethereum is a  decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.
All of that is bullshit after the DAO and the following hardforks to counter different attack vectors.
The Federated peg of RSK is upfront, well known and I would say its guarantees are stronger because of it.    We know that it's trusted.
@_date: 2016-12-06 06:18:17


Because everyone is running the same software.


If I can't run a node, then I have to trust miners and everyone else who can.   Bitcoin is no longer trustless at that point.  If nodes must run in data-centers, then bitcoin is dead.


No, that's a completely ridiculous thing to say.
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:26:14
How many node do you estimate losing if we hardfork?   I'm guessing we'll lose about 2k.
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:04:29
The progressives shouting for hardforks and block size increases are anti-bitcoin.   Our current trajectory is nearly perfect.   I think our restricted growth is building more demand.  There's still posts from people complaining about how hard it is to get Bitcoin.... and yet the price keeps climbing.     The 'fees' are negligible, and the 'backlogs' are temporary.
Do you think Facebook created more demand by being an exclusive network (.edu only) and slowly expanding?

People have been saying this for years but the data shows that merchant adoption is miniscule and no one wants to spend their BTC on anything but things you can't already purchase with CCs.  This means drugs, gambling, getting around capital controls and other forms of regulatory arbitrage.  Retail and Bitcoin just doesn't make sense.   That's why the big blockers who cry about 10 cent fees harming adoption are so ridiculous.

You still hold the keys (smart contracts) to the coins in a channel, so they yes you own them.  Just like in Bitcoin.

The use case is very similar to accepting 0-conf payments, except the window is reduced from ~10 minutes down to a few seconds.  The same way merchants take precaution with block confirmations, LN nodes will monitor for premature channel closures.    This sounds like a very trivial use case that was addressed early in the design process.

I used to use this logic too, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized majority of the people that buy into bitcoin don't even understand this anymore.  
Bitmain has something like 60% of the hashpower disguised as 3-4 pools.   Where is the outrage?    Instead we have rbtc saying that we  should be concerned about "dev centralization", instead of "miner centralization", while also push miner friendly BU.    Does anyone else think this is suspicious?
How is this not a bigger red flag?
Luckily, I don't think they have the balls to hardfork.  There is too much evidence that a hardfork will result into two chains, which will kill our uptrend.

It's acting as a store of value for me.  The only transactions I've been involved with are on exchanges, when I'm converting more worthless fiat into finite bitcoin units.   
While you can buy a movie ticket with Bitcoin, why do it?  Why sell bitcoin for something so mundane especially when you have more convenient options to use like credit cards?  It makes no sense to send BTC to a retailer who then turns around and converts it to fiat.
I don't buy anything with bitcoin unless I'm concerned with my privacy.

The guy got lucky and now his stupid rants backed by conspiracy theories are turning into an anti science movement which appeals to the scientifically illiterate and the dip shits who can't comprehend how Gresham's Law is playing out in front of us.   
They want to treat Bitcoin like bad money and spend spend spend, but we all know how counterproductive it is to spend BTC on the mundane things.    Retail is the very last part of bitcoin's adoption cycle.  We have years of acting as a store of value ahead of us, without any need to push for retail adoption.   
The folks that want low fees to power retail adoption, really just want to own PayPal 2.0 stock.   Bitcoin is far bigger than any payment network or currency.   Bitcoin will be the thing that backs all digital assets and all digital scarcity.

it's the only solution that doesn't require a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:53:22
I'm a programmer as well.   It's not crippling the network.   You must step back from seeing Bitcoin as a payment system that must scale up, and instead see it as a global consensus network that needs to scale out.  The broad network of nodes that are able to be ran in remote places in China, Venezuela, and Chile are Bitcoin's main value proposition and must be preserved at all costs,. BECAUSE without low node requirements we'll have to trust entities to run nodes for us.   That completely defeats the purpose of Bitcoin.   
The 'economic' arguments are all second to ensuring the global consensus network it healthy.     I'm a CS + economics graduate, so I know when econ voodoo applies and when it's irrelevant to computer systems.
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:42:16
lol, case in point.
@_date: 2016-11-29 16:53:58


It wasn't a majority.  It was a group of new and naive bitccoiners who didn't understand the tradeoffs that come with scaling on-chain.  I know because I was one of them.   But as I learned more, and did the blocksize math, and realized that scaling on-chain was not the way to go, and it doesn't even make a dent in the number of people we want to on-board.   Jeff Ratcliff had a similar journey, in that he was all for a hardfork, 2MB increases, and then learned the nuances and changed his mind.


He simply contributed to the debate.  That is all.  There wasn't any set upon plan.  Bitcoin XT then decided they were going to uni-laterially fork and take everyone with them to Mike Hearn land. 
Then scaling HK happened.
And shortly after SegWit SF was planned.
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:36:11
Roger Ver is an idiot.  How does he honestly think what he's doing is a good thing?   His actions at best will delay SegWit, at worst will split Bitcoin into two.

@_date: 2016-12-18 20:17:05
The network must be in consensus or nothing will get done.  So either the miners accept SegWit, or they fork off.  It's pretty obvious that  the developers who actually build cool shit for people are in support of SegWit.  Miner are our little bitches, so if they actually want to be able to sell their coins, they need to support the network of developers.    
@_date: 2016-11-16 01:32:56

IMO,  hardforks are an attack vector and should be avoided and frowned upon, UNLESS it is to fix something technical that the entire community agrees on.
Block size increases are probably the worst reason to perform a hardfork.   There are many amazing improvements that developers would love to have in Bitcoin that would fuel many different types of applications, that require a hardfork and should have priority.

Yes, it is.  You have no idea what you're talking about.  The 1MB limit is enforced by every node on the network  Miners can't just raise the blocksize without support of the network.    BU makes it so they can PUSH and PUSH and nodes either keep up or get left behind.  There's nothing preventing miners from centralizing and making blocks so big that we can no longer run nodes.  At that point we have to trust MINERS and large exchanges like Coinbase to enforce the consensus rules... INCLUDING the 21M limit.
We, the little guy must always be able to run a node on our home computer, otherwise we'll have to trust the men in the cloud again.

There is no guarantee that my transactions will get confirmed on both chains.   I'll see that it confirmed on my chain, while the business I made a purchase on won't get a confirmation or vice versa.     
This is a pretty obvious issue.  Consumers and merchants aren't guaranteed to be on the same fork once miners start pushing larger blocks.   The entire network is in an unworkable state until the conflict is settled.   The attack vectors and uncertainty goes through the roof.    
How is this idea getting any traction?
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:42:25
demand for finite blockchain space is only going to increase,. that means fees will continue to rise even if we use LN.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:39:32
Are you saying that it's ok to randomly split the chain in two while miners fight it out of how big their blocks will be?  Nodes are essentially bystanders, and are forced to accept the blocks or get left behind.

@_date: 2016-12-06 02:14:50
No! That's not how it works today.  Nodes ensure that miners can't create larger blocks.  It's part of the consensus rules.  Changing that to where miners drive the limit, allows miners to drive UP costs of running nodes, while they collect profits.  It completely fucks the checks and balances of Bitcoin.

It allows you to take bitcoins and use them on an alternative network for things like micro-transactions, eth-like contracts, privacy, etc.  
So it's obviously a way to offload transactions from bitcoin main, to other chains and scale.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:37:06
Hash power will split making one chain much weaker than the other and everything else will follow through from that.   You can't keep two bitcoin chains alive.   It's impossible for the ecosystem.   
The chain with the better promise will survive and it will become obvious rather quickly.  No one is going to buy coins from the dying chain.

Why not dogecoin, why not litecoin, why not any of the thousands of altcoins?  Why is Bitcoin Cash special?   It still suffers from malleability.  It has one developer who unilaterally declares hardforks.

Bitcoin cash is a nostalgic throwback for the people who found out about bitcoin in 2013, got all googly'd eyed for gavin and mike, and never evolved.   There is so much better technology and blockchains these days, that Bitcoin Cash looks like a clunky piece of shit in comparison.

It's just that many people think cheap transactions are the main value proposition, when it isn't.   It's about immutability.   We have cheap transactions with VISA,  Venmo, paypal, or any altcoin.   
You just have to ask yourself why you're here.  If you don't value immutablilty, then sell your Bitcoin.  If you want the fastest payments, buy Ripple.   There's an altcoin for everyone.

Miners can charge anything they want.   Everyone seems to forget this.   
With a little agreement between a few miners, they will determine fair market value to process your transactions within the next X blocks for $Y.   It's as simple as that.

I didn't say they control bitcoin.  But that's where the money is.  If miners can't sell their coins then they are obviously mining the wrong fork.   
Most of the exchanges have shown support for larger blocks, so it's pretty obvious which side of the fork they will be on.  Everyone follows the money.  There's no possible way two forks will survive.

This is such an arbitrary argument.   If we have more transactions on the network, more users, more everything, then we'll have more businesses that need to run nodes to ensure their payments are legit.  If anything, this will remove the number of pointless neckbeards that are running nodes as a hobby and increase the number of nodes ran by legit businesses that depend on bitcoin for their product/services.  That is way more important than having a network of hobbyists running nodes on their home DSL connections.


It's obvious. Larger blocks provide more tx throughput which means more utility and higher marketcap.    Centralization/Decentalization isn't even a factor at this point.  1MB blocks every 10 minutes is a joke.
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:47:23

Miners can't change the hard rules of Bitcoin..  21m coin limit, 4MB block weight, etc.  However, they do have control over transaction selection.  They can create any sort of arbitrary rules for the tx they include in a block.   
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:04:53


They will be worthless.  I mean, you can make a speculative bet, but if XT activates with 75% of the miners(or nodes?) in support of &gt; 1MB blocks, then the market has already made up its mind.
We're not going to have two forks of bitcoin running for any amount of time.  It should work itself out within a few days, because the cost of being on the wrong side of a $3.6B market ecosystem, is far too high.

Yes technicially, hashpower can be pointed at both, but there won't be any market for the &lt; 1MB chain.    So no one will buy them.  You can't spend them at Bitpay, you can't buy them at Coinbase or Circle.   That's over half the ecosystem right there.    The miners in China are in support of bigger blocks too.    
If I can find an exchange that still sells Bitcoin(neckbeard edition coins) after the fork, then you can bet your ass I'm going to sell those shit coins and buy more bitcoin and transfer that shit out of there ASAP.

BTC will win in the long run, but this BCH pump is impressive.   Onchain transactions are not that fast.  Even back in 2013, (the glory days of BTC), i wasn't impressed with the speed of blockchains, so these people who think on-chain tx is as good as it gets are very mistaken.   LN actually has the ability to create a verifiable instant tx network.  On-chain tx and big blocks won't stand a chance.
@_date: 2015-08-21 06:39:08
It really sounds like a nightmare to bootstrap.  What's the plan?
@_date: 2015-08-20 04:38:47
Imagine we go back in time 2 years and remove the 1MB limit.   At that point, China is just starting to get into the mining game.   If larger blocks were a norm, it would have put China's mining operations in check because they would have had more orphans due to poor connectivity.. right? 
That's what they keep telling us.  Big blocks would prevent people with poor connections from running nodes.  
It looks to me like these core devs caused the China centralization problem.  Combine that will having high dust limits and high minimum fees that choked out SatoshiDice and now we have a lack of transactions flowing on the network.  
Now they are saying that you shouldn't use L1 Bitcoin for anything except settlement transactions and to wait another 2 years for LN to materialize.  
XT is garbage, but these core devs need to pull their head out of the code and look around at the ecosystem of pissed off business and users.
@_date: 2015-08-20 02:58:24
The business usually fails because most engineers can't see the forest from the trees.  A strong CEO guides the company while engineers make sure the system can support his vision.   Jobs and Woz is a perfect example.  
The problem with bitcoin is that it's just a bunch of neckberds who don't give a flying fuck about anything except how many bits can be pushed over their grandmas dsl connection even tho grandma doesn't give a fuck about bitcoin.
Freezing the blocksize is stalling adoption and will continue to send the price and mining hash power down.

I can't find the thread.  I think the topic was on BitID/Onename and how you can use pub/priv keys for auth.  Your argument was that certs are the same thing and because they didn't catch on then there's no chance of BitID or any other scheme of succeeding.   You then ran in circles with the same type of arguments you're using here against mesh networks, while everyone else is talking about Bitmesh.  Classic trolling.

@_date: 2017-11-10 19:49:05
It's not 'manipulative'.  
Think about who benefits from high fees.   Miners do!.  They provide the security, so as the block reward diminishes, we need a healthy fee market to ensure that miners will continue processing blocks.   
The more services that rely on bitcoins immutable consensus, the more each block is worth.   Everything else can be essentially pegged to these blocks via side-chains or whatever.  The point is that we don't need multiple PoW chains, we only need one.   One internet of value with Bitcoin as the base currency.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:23:41
Support for more transactions = more users = brighter future = higher speculator value = miners making more off their rewards = higher profits = more hashpower = longest chain = big blocks ftw.

Do you always stare at hockey stick graphs?  Because that's what you're suggesting here.  If it goes to infinity blah blah, red herring.
Everyone forgets that miners can charge anything they want.    They can charge $20 for a 1 block confirmation for a transactions over $10000.   There is nothing stopping them from acting this way and it doesn't have to be 100% effective, it just has to be effective enough to mess with the odds your transaction getting approved in a timely miner.  
You'll have to consider if you're willing to pay X for Y or something else for a different priority.   Eventually other miners will catch on and realize that working together is better for everyone.  Collusion, how can it be stopped?  Either miners are spamming their selves to increase fees, or they set prices for their service.    
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:25:18

What are you talking about?  
Are you implying that having a dynamic fee system is somehow a bad thing?  Miners make more money off of the fee markets and YOU get the ability to change priority of your transaction, depending on urgency.
Doesn't sound like a bad thing to me.  
You have to understand that we are dealing with a limited resource.  Block space!  The best way to determine what this limited space is worth is with a market.     
Any other blockchain that promises to process all transactions all the time, will end up being inflationary or run by a miner monopoly.  
@_date: 2015-07-23 03:05:04
For every doubling of the block limit, it will double the attack cost.   Wallets need to be updated anyway to use replace by fee and miners need First Seen replace by fee code.  With a little more money these stress tests will force progress.
@_date: 2015-07-07 05:53:03
*Queue Peter Todd*
Well, you see, if the miners would run my replace by fee, free for all patch, then fees will go up even more, ensuring the mining monopoly is strong!  The users of the network will be forced into a bidding war over some arbitrary period of time to get into a blocks.   It's a fun experience.  But if you don't like that, then you can sign up to one of these "Coinbase-approved" lightning networks.

My question is: Why isn't this obvious to everyone?
This is how all the markets work, this is how business works.  
If a company is posting positive growth numbers and positive outlook, then the stock price goes up.  It's a no brainer.  If a company says that they are going to keep production as it is and focus on R/D for the next 2 years (realistic LN rollout time table), then the stock price is going down.  That's a problem for the company, so they need to manage shareholder expectations so that they don't lose funding.   The company needs the shareholders money to spend on R/D.   
In our case, VC money needs to keep flowing into the Bitcoin ecosystem to make sure that all these little startups have the money to survive until the killer apps arrive.   At the same time, Bitcoin core devs are scaring off many businesses with their stance on not wanting to raise the blocksize, that L1 bitcoin should be only for settlement, and to wait until LN arrives.
If LN is the game plan, then there needs to be a HELL of a lot more resources being put into making that a reality.  Because every piece of software that uses bitcoin TO DATE, will need to be updated to use LN instead.  That is a ridiculous amount of work.

Bitcoin rose from the depths of the internet as a grass roots, financial freedom movement, after the 2008 banking collpase.   
Send money like your sending an email over a distributed network, just like bittorrent.  One big difference between the two networks is that bittorrent is for duplicating data, while bitcoin prevents duplication or counterfeit coins.
Bitcoin spans the globe, touching every country that has internet.  Only 21 millions coins will ever be created, so it acts as a digital gold.  
If the people of Greece used bitcoin, they could have avoided the current capital controls and protected their wealth from confiscation.  Too late now but maybe next time the people will wise up.

Sure, that's a possibility, but that's assuming bitcoin is gaining value faster than all other assets.. which is not likely if bitcoin is mainstream.  It should plateau and then slowly increase as we increase our productivity.   
The other thing to note is that crowdfunding should be the new way to fund all large projects and business ventures.  Your savings, capital, should be allocated to projects that you approve of.  Instead of the government spending wildly on anything they want, funded by debt, they would have to balance a budget and get support from the people to fund it.  
Have you seen Captain America?  His initial job was to rally support and get people to buy war bonds to fund the military.  Essentially the government has to beg you to support their causes.  It's quite a bit different than the world we live in today.   If bitcoin becomes mainstream everyone should have control of their saving/capital and be able to choose precisely where it goes and what they support.

LOL you wanna bet?   
Here are the two options:
BitcoinXT has larger blocks which means more tx throughput, cheaper fees, more users, more businesses running nodes, and a larger economy.
Bitcoin (Neckbeard edition) has 1MB blocks, lower throughput, higher fees, smaller economy.
If both of these coins where listed on the same exchange, which one do you think would trade at a premium?   It's pretty obvious.    It's all about money and future growth.

@_date: 2015-07-09 01:23:41
Yup, the issue is that coders want to code, so they think they must solve it by clever fee structures inside bitcoin core.  But really fee structures can be completely arbitrary and based off what people are willing to pay.  Not what it costs to shuffle a few KB across the network and store it.   Odds are that we are willing to pay more than the actual cost, because the utility of bitcoin is so high in comparison to legacy systems.

Previous policy was to bump the soft-limit as tx throughput increased, which would eventually run into the hardcap and cause that to be lifted as well.
What he's saying is that you are declaring a policy change, in that you want to see a fee market develop by putting a cap on tx throughput.
You and few other devs are the ones declaring a policy change, that's why hates you.  =)

Companies have put their bitcoin integration plans on hold because of the blocksize debate.  Suddenly core developers don't want to scale bitcoin.  They want everyone to use LN instead... which is still vaporware.  So what are large businesses supposed to do?   Everything is in a holding pattern now... combine that with the reward halving next year and we could be seeing new price lows, which may kill confidence even more.  
Downward spiral?
So yes, if we had more capacity, then we could have more businesses, which would create more compelling services, which would attract more users and create more transactions, which increases demand and prices too.

Not everyone has access to Visa and Mastercards.  Bitcoin payments would create a "cash" like payment mechanism for their service.

He's breaking the original social contract that brought bitcoin together and layed out its future.  He's a deep coder who thought that he proved that a distributed consensus was impossible.  This should allude to his hubris and also his problem solving abilities.   He thinks within the box.  Satoshi proved that it was possible over time &amp; work to come to a consensus.  nullc didn't see that as being a possibility because he thinks in much more absolute terms.  Even Peter Todd says that bitcoin doesn't work in theory, but it works in practice.   
Non-computer science glue holds bitcoin together.  This glue is what Mike is talking about.  It's the social contract that brought together early bitcoiners, miners, developers, stakeholders, etc and is the only reason it's popular today.  
The genesis block set the tone.  Satoshis correspondences set the roadmap.

4) There are so many cool Bitcoin projects right now it's crazy to think that it's not catching on.
The client side cert argument was basically the same argument you're having with other folks about what a mesh network technically is, versus what Bitmesh is actually doing.

Here's my reasoning for saying that bitcoin has a "strong network effect"
Network effect for bitcoin means that it has more users, exchanges, merchants, businesses, github repos, etc than any other crypto-currency, which then creates more demand for bitcoin, which then attracts more users, speculators, exchanges, merchants, businesses, dev projects, etc.    Each of these things adds value to the network and increases utility.

Who is going to buy a governments debt if the people aren't holding their shitty fiat?  What do governments produce that would entice investors to give them money?  
@_date: 2019-04-20 06:15:03
LOL, that's not accurate.  Core didn't say fuck it.  They said good luck hardforking without consensus. Also hashpower does not equal consensus. UASF then came along and upped the anty, saying basically,  miners are little bitches that work for the network and they either do what the network wants (softfork) or they get fired.    Miners gave in, activated segwit,  BCH kids still threw a fit and finally launched shitcoin cash which collected all big blocker retards into one sub/coin and here we are today.
For historical context.
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:10:30
The so called liquidity is basically a few whales that throw down 40-100 BTC on the bid or ask, that tells the market which direction they want us to go.  I watched ~70BTC bids push us the entire way up to 5400, Which suddenly vanished and became a 60 BTC sell wall.    Typical whale bullshit.  The market buy FOMO kids move the market in the opposite direction of the whale walls.   If you watch the actual trade history, it's a small fraction that appears to be on the books.  Majority of volume disappears as soon as the price gets near it.  0.0029x volume trades print more candles than &gt; 1 BTC.

Dude, do you watch the news? Governments fail every day.  
Fixed money supply would put the government in chains and force it to work for the people.  Also if the people push for programs, they will feel the rise of taxes instantly, which would curtail their desire for shitty services.

@_date: 2017-04-06 03:35:05
nope, they will double down and wait for their next opportunity to try and hardfork.   They don't care how or why, they start with the goal of hardforking and work backwards, hitching their wagon to anything that comes along.
Cargo cult hardforkers.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:33:16
Exactly, we're not getting 10x over existing systems with on-chain transactions.  It doesn't matter how big blocks are.   
However, we might be able to get 10x improvement by using something like Lightning Network where transactions can be instant and fractions of a penny..    But it still depends on the use case.  Maybe Bitcoin can't out compete directly with old use cases, but new use cases are being created.
For example, Brave, the new browser, needs to make use of trustless micro-payments... The old payment tech can't even touch that.
@_date: 2015-07-10 17:03:54
Or they can raise the price arbitrarily and see if you'll pay it,  like every other industry.  Everyone is over thinking the idea of fees from a technical perspective.  No one is going to pay for bytes or number of utxo or some other shit.

@_date: 2016-02-07 09:10:07
You're 100% correct.  
I think it will take less than 24 hours after the first large block is created for all pro Classic bitcoiners to realize their plan to fork was actually a disaster and switch back.  As soon as those large blocks go through, it's going to be a cluster fuck...  Of course, the price will dive when this happens.   I **should** sell now and wait for the buying opportunity. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 09:04:46
This could be really good for bitcoin.  P2P transfers will become more and more popular in the future and Im sure some of these transactions will be for semi anonymous bitcoin.    Which is a stark contrast to Facebook knowing even more about you...

It's funny how reality is  the exact opposite. The only people that can be fired in Bitcoin, are the miners.    How are miners this dumb?  
 They re locked in a zero sum gamr and an arms race.   Their survival as large entities is impossible over the long haul.  20 years out, the current mining cartels should be extinct. 
The reason is, eventually mining tech will plateau and  block rewards will be near zero.  So if there is any profit left, then new players will enter until there is none left .   
Profit for miners will always trend towards zero.

With RBF, you can pretty easily change the fee to make it into a block.  Ideally, a wallet would have an auto reestablish channel option, so it checks the fee needed and creates a new channel, according to your preferences.
I guess my point is that these issues are not insurmountable.   We can create user interfaces that hide the complexity.    
The internals of sending this packet across to the internet is complex too, due to the stateless nature of the TCP/IP,  but to me, the end user, it just works.

The current idea of bitcoin birthed a $6.5B market cap because it is resiliant to change and manipulation.  Hardforks unmine that and set a very bad precedent, especially if it's orchestrated by a loud minority of the ecosystem.
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:43:52
Welcome back!
I went full circle on the debate too.   I never supported XT or Classic, but I wanted big blocks for the longest time. 
Eventually I realized Core was right, we can't scale up the blocksize very far without threatening fungibility.  In addition, a hardfork should be the very last option we take.. and we should strive to avoid them at all cost.   
Hardforks are the attack vector malicious actors have to take to change the fundamentals of Bitcoin.  We can't make them easy or routine or safe.  Anyone selling you that hardforks should be common doesn't understand where bitcoin derives it's value.

The original discussion was about merchants accepting bitcoin.  Since you lived through 2013-2015, you should remember the huge push for merchange adoption, only to watch the price fall month after month as people cut their loses and spend their coins on shit.    Remeber Bitpays "bitcoin bowl"?  LOL!  Bitpays numbers where horrible during those days, and are probably still shit today.   No one wanted Bitcoins.  Merchants didn't hodl, so the price kept dropping.   It didn't matter how many people accepted bitcoin.


It wasn't until the merchant narrative basically died, and we went back to the of store of value,  digital gold, hedge against the worlds inflationary currency, that the price found a footing and then started to climb again.  Bitcoin went from being a laughable currency, to an interesting commodity and then wall street starting spreading the word about a non-correlated asset, ETFs, and then BOOM.  We ended up with the 20k bubble.
Merchant adoption is fucking pointless at this stage.   If they want to connect to the Lightning Network and help build a payment network that's actually faster than VISA, then awesome.  Otherwise, they only act to depress the price.

Thanks for doing this. I've been here for a long time.. 7 years according to my account creation, and refuting FUD gets very tiresome.  There are a few oldtimers on that try to keep things sane, but it's very difficult to educate all the newcomers as they flood in.  
I always wanted to build a reference guide but after seeing what has done with their "reference" material, all attempts look more like propaganda than anything else. 
An interesting aspect that gets lost is WHEN things happen and what sort of names/memes are born from events.  (Context)  For example  "BlockstreamCore" came from a napkin sketch shortly after Peter_R got involved in Bitcoin and decided to bring "economics" to an engineering debate.    Then we have the mirgration of angry BitcoinXTers that made \r\btc their new home.   There are old posts in \r\bitcoinxt that set the tone for \r\btc narratives and game plan of attack.  \u\ydtm (from xt) played a huge part in building majority of the \r\btc's original narratives.     
There is a pretty solid history on reddit that show the escalation of lies, FUD, etc, if one was motivated to datamine it.     The difficult part is presentation.  How can you show the vast story behind our memes, culture, values, and division.

@_date: 2018-03-09 21:20:33
Redditor for 6 weeks,   I've been here debating bitcoin for 5 years.
At first I thought day to day currency and merchant adoption where the obvious path, but the more I learned about the network, software, capacity limits, and what a decentralized consensus is and how it applies to hard currency, I found that the foundation of bitcoin is at least 100x better than anything before it.   All incremental changes that altcoins have done, are at most 2x improvement over what Bitcoin already offers.  They say that for a new technology to break through, it has to be at least 10x better.  For day to day currency and payment networks, Bitcoin is horrible in comparison to VISA, swift, etc.    For international transfers, Bitcoin is maybe 3x better, depending on the use case.
However, for an immutable store of value with an algorithmic fixed inflation schedule, Bitcoin might be one of the biggest technological breakthroughs since double entry accounting in the 1500s.     So while you sit here and attempt to debate the merits of merchant adoption and price increases, the long game is simply more of the same,  because the foundation of Bitcoin is monumental, to say the very least and merchant adoption will come in time, but it is not the "killer" app.

Segwit allows for more throughput  (same as having bigger blocks)

@_date: 2017-09-28 22:41:02
The point of HKA, was to show miners that there is a solid roadmap, with throughput increases, and doesn't require a hardfork.   The Core developers see this as the best path forward.
The point of NYA, was to hardfork, but also activate segwit.    Not a single Core developer thinks segwit2x hardfork is necessary or worth the risk/reward at this stage.  
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:29:26
I used to think the same thing, but bcash exists.  so I'm obviously wrong.  Miners are willing to throw money away on pet projects with no users.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:34:53

I dismiss it because he doesn't have access to much more information than standard users do.  I think only admins have high enough level of visibility to get the numbers to figure it out.   However, it doesn't take much to see the clashes between the two subs on a weekly basis.  
Buttcoiners pretty much fuel up on karma in a buttcoin circlejerk, then head over to bitcoin to get down voted.   It's pretty obvious, when their accounts only post in two subs.  I've aggregated karma on a few users using the API, but that just proves the user is a troll and our mods don't give a shit.
It might not be a bad idea to have admins look closer into the parasitic relationship of buttcoin, but I doubt they'll do much.  Ban users? They can just create more accounts.  Ban the sub?   I wouldn't mind, but they would just regroup.  Isn't it amazing how determined they are?  They get banned over and over again and keep creating zero day accounts to spread some negative bullshit.  It's ridiculous.
It's just technology for fucks sake.

@_date: 2015-04-28 22:20:26
Yes and no.  There is a chance that they(IBM, IoT folks, banks) form a consortium to secure their own blockchain for their purposes and convince people that an independent and global blockchain is not needed.    Of course, some other companies will not trust them, so they'll create their own.   All while bitcoin is humming along, being independant.   We know the difference between the two systems, but hardly anyone else would.

How long before they get sued for enabling money laundering or funding individuals on the USA blacklist.    There's a huge liability issue that occurs with Ripple, Stellar, Eris, IBM, etc..

You guys, however, are a broken record with no new arguments.  You have been debated hundreds of times and yet you still pile into every /new/ thread with canned FUD.  You get down voted because we're tired of hearing the same shit arguments again and again and waste energy on you.

Seriously?   DERP!!
Followed by you poking the hornets nest.  


Yet it gets immediately downvoted because it's not pumping up bitcoin.
This is a place to talk about the up and down sides about this new digital currency.
The fact that simple questions are downvoted exemplifies why everyone else outside of this subreddit thinks this is a cult.
The community will upvote and downvote anything they please.  Many posts that get downvotes initially, turn around and get voted to the front page because it spurs a debate.   You're a mod, you should be aware of such things.  Calling the sub you moderate a cult is very poor taste.  If you had any social skills what-so-ever, you could have posted something of interest to start a debate.   Instead, you post something to win points by your new pals in r/buttcoin.    Your 'MODERATOR' privileges are not helping this sub.
The facts are that is a cult of glass half empty, negative jerks, who go out of their way to stir up shit, vote brigade, stomp on every reasonable effort to show the advantages of bitcoin and then laugh about it.   It's a group of trolls plain and simple.
Now go pat yourself on the back for joining You're so enlightened and wise.

Also, much of the larger pools hashing power comes from random people pointing their personal hardware at it and they can switch to a different pool at a moments notice.  Pool hashing power is not static.  It can literally change in minutes, as we've seen in the past with GHash.

Yup,  It's pretty easy to get bitcoin these days.  All we need is a little run away inflation or something bad in the real economy to happen and the traders will do the obvious.  Buy Bitcoin, because lets face it, traders are gonna trade.   
The second thing to look for is if regular Joes start buying.  At that point, it will go viral and probably turn into a huge fucking bubble.We have $1150 pegged as the high water mark and it was still relatively difficult to get bitcoins back then.  Exciting times are ahead.

A better option would be to create services that require bitcoin, which then generates organic demand and spurs a market.  Silkroad(drugs) is one, but more markets for information, betting, remittance, etc, will create more demand.

People may use it, but when you start thinking about a business like Factom, which is built on the premise of an immutable blockchain, then they can't fuck around with something that may or may not be supported by IBM in 10-20 years.  When you are anchored to Bitcoin then there is a market mechanism that will keep it alive if it's valuable.  IBM and any other centralized blockchain could be forced to shutdown under government pressures, or they loss interest and deprecate it on their own, or the government adds constraints to what can be stored in it,etc...   Lets be honest though, there is no technical reason why a centralize blockchain can't work.  The issues are always political.  If you want immutability at all costs, then you choose Bitcoin.  
Did you notice the infinity sign in that last Factom video?   It's because The Blockchain has potential to outlast any government or organization.

I guess it's kind of complex to grasp why an incentive token is needed if you think a blockchain is just a ledger that cryptographically signs all the blocks before it.  That is ONE part of the system, but it has no purpose if the chain is locked behind closed doors, because the chain can be rewritten at any time.  All bitcoiners know that this is where proof of work comes in.   But even POW, doesn't have a real purpose unless others are doing it too.  It must be distributed.   But even this concept gets mangled into people thinking that consensus could be established between trusted parties (Ripple, Stellar, IBM, etc).  But we all know that if the owners of the network are known and hold control over even one part of the system, it can be corrupted, sued, censored, shutdown and abandoned.
It took me a while to realize how absolutely vital the token is for bootstrapping a decentralized network.  It can not be done without an incentive unless you add trust.    There is NO getting around that.  Competition for a scarce token is what secures the network.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't all of those pools public and allow anyone to point their hashing power to them?  If so, do we have any idea what percentage of that hash power is not actually under their control, meaning, that it can point to another pool at any time.  If so, the strength of any given pool or pools, for that matter, could be highly inflated.   As soon as an attack is identified, hashing power needs to coordinate and shift to another pool that is not participating in the attack.     It would be interesting to simulate how to overcome a 51% attack... and in the case of the NSA attacking, it probably wouldn't come as a double spend, but they instead stop processing transactions.

 What does your Samsung refrig API look like?  I'll bet it's different than a GE refrig and every other connected device out there.  They all speak a different language.   
Another problem is if the refrig is online right at this moment or not.  What if you send a message and it doesn't get to your frig?  Where does that message go?  Does it go to Samsung's private cloud, which will then relay that message back to your frig next time it comes online?   That is a possibility, but it's easier to publish that message to The Blockchain and then when the frig comes online it checks it's state and looks for commands.
The blockchain can be the common language and state among all devices.

It's these little jabs that make buttcoiners stand out.  And you do it too.  It's "concern trolling".   Don't you see it?  LOL.


More concern trolling.
The only echo I ever hear, is the echo of trolls, talking about ponzi schemes, cults, 2.5 transactions per second (like it's not on our list of improvements), price dropping to zero, flatlined usage (even though most graphs are up) and how any dissenting opinion is shut down (which it's not, we've talked about everything).

They came from someone who wanted to buy $10k worth of bitcoin for their own reasons.  
It could be for speculation, a wild hedge on economic uncertainty, online purchases, maybe they're traveling to another country for a few months and want to spend cash instead of credit while they're there.   There are many reason why some one would purchase bitcoin.    
If you think it's a ponzi then everything is a ponzi.  I bought comic books 20 years ago for a $1 and can sell them on ebay for $20 now... Where did that $19 come for... with your logic it's a ponzi, because I can now sell them for more than I bought them for.

I would work towards blanketing the world with "BitcoinWifi" access points.  These would allow you connect to the access point via a small bitcoin payment.   This would essentially do away with broadband contracts and dealing with ISPs. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:02:02


If they do and if the community finds out then all confidence will be lost and the price would probably plummet.   Bitcoin is only viable if there isn't a majority in control of the network.  It's essentially a failure at that point.
The fear is that they will be able to create blocks faster than all other miners combined.  This means they don't need to accept anyone elses blocks and can essentially control everything about the network.   The "fork" is initiated as soon as the other miners work is no longer needed.   The longest chain wins.

I doubt 21 Inc APIs will stay closed source forever and if they do, then there's nothing stopping someone else from creating something similar and open sourcing it.
Everyone thinks too myopically around here.
Here's my take.
**IF** 21Inc's pool gains substantial hashing power via these IoT devices, then it means IoT is a success.   At that point, I can guarantee that there will be competitors in this space.    It also means that Bitcoins hashing power has been decentralized from large farms  to millions of small IoT devices.
What about pools?   If IoT is really using the Bitcoin blockchain as its central nervous system, then it requires millions of transactions per second.  This means we will have to have something like lightning networks + sidechains to validate and submit all the transactions (aka state changes).
LN is supposed to have a very low barrier to entry, so odds are that there will be thousands if not hundreds of thousands of LN nodes allowing your devices to open small channels to transact and update its state.
You see this:
21 Inc Toaster -&gt;  21 Inc Pool -&gt;  Blockchain

Toaster -&gt; Generic open source protocol -&gt;  LN Hub -&gt;  Blockchain

To bypass the spam attack, pay a slightly higher fee..   The nice thing about bitcoin is that it has unlimited express lanes to bypass congestion, if you're in a hurry.
**Which fee should I use?**
The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 100 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 22,600 satoshis (0.12$).
@_date: 2016-10-25 04:21:31
Before sending a transaction, it's wise to check the current state of the network.. Ideally, your wallet should do this for you.  If your wallet supported replace by fee (RBF), then you would be able to fix it.

I'm not sure what the trigger was, but at some point in mid 2015 I stopped looking at Bitcoin as being a payment network that must scale up, and instead saw it as a consensus network that must scale out.
From then on Core's roadmap made perfect sense.

You are wrong.
There are various skills that give you an edge whether you're betting/investing in stocks, horse racing, boxing, MMA, or openining a coffee shop on the corner.
The end result is always the same.  You are spending your savings or borrow  money (leveraged) based on your ability to predict the future.  It could be the future of iphone demand, super bowl winners, or coffee demand in your local neighborhood.  There is always the chance of you being wrong and all of your capital plus everyone else's capital being wasted... therefore it is a gamble.  Hell even choosing your major in college is a gamble.  You're betting on your ability to predict the future demand for the skills you want sell to an unknown future employer.
It's all the same and there are many bad decisions made by everyone that leads to non-optimal outcomes.  Having open betting markets like Augur, is a huge step forward in removing the taboo of "gambling" and rebranding it as risk management. AKA insurance.

Does this blockchain have native tokens?  Do these tokens have a value?  If so how?   Are these tokens backed by bankers willingness to accept them in exchange for fiat? or something else, like gold, silver, oil? etc?  
How do bankers create a new token that has market value with NO counterparty risk and is zero trust, like bitcoin?  
If they can't create this, then they have a fancy settlement system for IOUs and everything is based on trust again.  Which means that the whole system can come crashing down again when they can not prove their reserves.
I made a post about this topic the other day.

Thanks for asking the community what they think.   I feel that while Blockstream does great technical work, they haven't been as communicative about Bitcoins pivot.   
We've been left out in the cold when the bitcoin mission changed from being P2P cash for the world, to a global settlement network.  I understand that it's possible to build P2P cash on top of the settlement network, but it's all vaporware as of today.  This misunderstanding, runs deep and even the most well funded startups in this business believed we would scale bitcoin by raising blocksizes without much controversy.  
Somewhere within the last few years, things changed.  
Maybe it was always obvious for the devs close to the source code, but somehow this was lost in translation to the growing community.  Most don't understand how important decentralization is, because it's largely political.
In addition, hasn't been the most friendly to the folks who understood this for the beginning.  Libertarians.  So while this place was overran with haters, trolls, statists, etc,  the people who best explain what bitcoin really is, have left, or stopped posting because of the ridicule.  In turn, the messaging changed and everyone forgot what bitcoin was.
So to the new naive populace of bitcoiners, they think the killer feature is being able to send transactions around the world for cheap.  And in turn, for bitcoin to succeed, we just need more capacity.  If a little centralization occurs, then that's ok, because the network will always adapt as technology gets better.   
However, as we learn more about Bitcoin, we realize how political its roots are.  
Decentralization is the only thing that keeps it from being tampered with and ensuring that Bitcoins most valuable attribute, 21 million coin limit, can not be changed.  Fixed money supply is probably the most controversial topic on earth.   It has the potential to completely rewrite everything.   Maybe you guys (Blockstream) like to bury yourselves in the weeds in the technicalities and not speak publicly about what this really means, because it is so controversial.
However, at the same time, this community would be 10000% more interesting if everyone understood WHY decentralization is the only feature that matters, IF you want to keep a fixed currency base.  Without it, everything else is in jeopardy, and the most important invention in history will be subverted into transmitting debt around the world instead of value.
So the root of the entire problem, are the mods of They allowed the smart folks who understood the importance of decentralization, to be chased out by moon kids who just want adoption at all costs and trolls because they think it balances the conversation.
tl;dr;  decentalization

(efficient/cheap paths to those types of services)  Then go about your daily spending using that wallet.    Reload it when you deplete your stash.    Easy peezy.

Bitcoin can be the new bedrock of value.   If you fuck up bitcoin and sacrifice it's decentralization for scale, then who is next in line to fill those shoes?  Litecoin?    Eth?  Monero?  
There must be an asset that is completely immutable, and the only way to ensure immutability is to prioritize decentralization over all other concerns.  
I think Bitcoin is the best digital asset for that task.   All other networks can be used as payment rail, I don't give a flying fuck about coffee transactions or Bitpay going out of business because onchain fees are too much for them.

Exactly, they try to use terms like gas and fuel, but there is a market price for gas.   If I'm not mistaken, Etheruem will be inflationary too.  ~3%.  I think the difference is the messaging.  Bitcoin tries to be a store of value, currency, medium exchange, while ether is fuel to power smart contracts.
I won't be surprised if there will be some conflicts in messaging in the future as pump and dumpers try to buy up ether, then try to convince others too because of moon.

If what you claim is true, then we'll have a million insecure blockchains waiting to be 51% attacked by any botnet.   You're forgetting that bitcoin is worth something because of the huge network of cpmputers that secure the blockchain.  This is only possible because of the block reward and fee structure that incentivize the miners.  Without that, a blockchain is meaningless and should be replaced with a centralized SQL database.

Software that is based on compromise is shit.  That's why Etheruem has the edge.  They have a unified front of development.

Before sending a transaction, it's wise to check the current state of the network.. Ideally, your wallet should do this for you.  If your wallet supported replace by fee (RBF), then you would be able to fix it.
**Which fee should I use?**
The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 100 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top. For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 22,600 satoshis (0.12$).

Here's Matt ripping Zander to pieces.  
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:55:51
No no no,   Bitcoin was birthed to create a trustless system of value transfer.   For the system to remain trustless, YOU must be able to run a node.   
The game theory piece to prevent arbitrary rewriting of the ledger is PoW and that ensures you burn energy to extend the chain, and makes it expensive to change it.  Validation of the rules, is the job of the nodes.  Miners don't make the rules, they follow the rules as defined by the nodes.   If miners try breaking consensus rules, they'll hardfork themselves off the network.
A UASF, is when the nodes decide to change the rules slightly, and if the miners want to be paid for their work, they must follow the rule change as well. 
I point to the coin.dance poll, as a simple metric to show that majority of the ecosystem, who run nodes, businesses, users (aka economic majority), want Segwit, and will support Segwit blocks if the miners created them. (&gt;0.13.1)   
BIP 148, says that any block that doesn't signal Segwit will be invalid.   All we need is a subset of hashpower to only create Segwit blocks, and the BIP 148 nodes throwing non-segwit blocks and we'll effectively orphan every non-segwit block until the miners realize, if they want to get paid, they had better follow the rules.
Bitcoin has always operated this way, but for some reason miners don't know how to comprehend the white-paper, so they continuously spread misinformation making to sound like they make the rules.
There is no sybil attack here.
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:13:43
It is larger blocks.  If you use segwit transactions, which 86% of the ecosystem is already prepared for ( then it should provide substantial increase in throughput.  Plus the transactions are immutable, so LN can use them for long lived channels.   PLUS, the segwit discount allows for the cleanup of the UTXO set, since it makes it roughly about the same cost to perform a 1-&gt;many transaction and a many-&gt; 1 transaction.
Currently it's almost 4 times more expensive to perform a many -&gt; 1 operation, than a 1 -&gt; many.    This feature also makes coinjoins more efficient.
Segwit is larger blocks and a whole lot more cool shit, that we need to improve the health of bitcoin over the long term.    
Big blocks doesn't do any of that.  
It's actually makes the system less healthy and only does 1 thing,  alleviate transaction fees. THAT IS ALL IT DOES.
Do you get it now?

In addition to everything you say, I still think it's gaining market share because it's a new outlet for crypto innovation.  
We've seen just about everything they are selling in one form or another exist first in the bitcoin ecosystem.   That isn't stopping the hype, if anything it's fueling it further because people make assine comparisons that Bitcoin = myspace , Eth = facebook, or some shit.   Whatever the moon kids need to tell themselves and their friends to keep the speculators pouring in.   
Eth does have some serious technical challenges facing them in the next few years, as does Bitcoin, but the big difference is the unified community+developers in Eth aren't worried about decentralization or what it takes to be a currency.  They don't have to worry about softforking as to not disrupt legacy nodes.  They are able to sprint because they are starting from scratch.   They also seem to be much less worried about the authorities.
Bitcoin came from a much more cautious and pessimistic world, where everyone was a threat to it.  It had to continue operating for years, to build trust and prove to everyone that a decentralized consensus was possible AND support a currency.  It proved the model that Eth is able to leverage.
Now that Eth is gaining market share, the target will no longer be solely pointed at Bitcoin.   Eth is going to come under the same scrutiny and MORE, especially with the success of the DAO.     Eth may sidestep the scrutiny of trying to be a currency, because they marketed as being a platform, but we all know it's a trojan horse.  The DAO, even if it fails miserably, is a testament to where this technology is leading.   
If the financial system didn't see the writing on the wall with Bitcoin, Eth and the DAO pretty much lit a bonfire in their front yard.  How are the authorities going to respond now that there are TWO decentralized systems routing around their artificial barriers?  Especially when Ethereum's founders are known and are still actively developing their system!

Scaling on-chain is such a bad idea.  Anyone who supports it hasn't thought through the ramifications 10 years down the road and the impact it can have on countries with less bandwidth.  
I support smart scaling on L2 systems.  
Big blockers have shown themselves to be selfish and lazy.   If all these big block proponents just put some resources into L2 systems, Thunder, LN, Liquid, payment channels between their services, it would alleviate majority of the load from L1 bitcoin.
Instead they push forward the easiest solution for themselves and the worst solution for Bitcoin.
My opinion is that Bitcoin should be unchangable, only then, can it support a marketcap in the trillions.

I doubt its meant to mislead, its just hard to explain that there is implied trust with banks and that bitcoin makes it so you don't don't have to trust them any longer to debit/credit peoples accounts.   Bitcoin does the accounting for you and prevents double spends.  You no longer have to have a mutually trusted 3rd party for global transactions.  That fact gave rise to a trustless p2p money claims that everyone uses.   context matters.    If you're buying something from someone else, of course you should do your due diligence so that you don't get scammed.  This has always been true.  Bitcoin doesn't change this.

Here's Adam talking about IOUs 
If you issue an IOU, usually you have to post collateral.  As I mentioned in other responses, Bitcoin could be used as collateral and also act as the backing behind this new banking system.  No more gold.  Bitcoin is a bearer asset.

I like Eth too, because it's an outlet for a lot of new innovations.  The crypto space feels like it's heating up again.  I bought some Eth early on, but a bug in the wallet I used ate them.  
Bitcoin does feel stagnate as a lot of energy is being diverted, but we all know how the hype cycle works.   When you strip all the hype away and look at the real utility of the systems, I'm still unsure if Eth smart contracts will generate wealth or dividends for the DAO.
The prime innovation that keeps these systems running is the decentralized consensus and if Etheruem can't keep that together, it's will break apart at the seems.   They are facing a much bigger challenge than Bitcoin on that front, but people have **hope** that it will be figured out.  And hope is all speculators need.
Bitcoin isn't hopeless, but the blocksize debate has created enough doubt, that speculators are beginning to bail out.  The next leg up didn't happen and trading technicials are beginning to fade, so naturally the hype train is shifting.   Etheruem currently has the lead. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 17:59:14
I'm assuming these IOUs are backed by bitcoin or at least collateralized by bitcoin, is that true?   It seems like the exchange could/should sign a bitcoin address, and/or timelock collateral for all IOUs, in case of default.
@_date: 2015-10-30 16:14:21
To understand why private blockchains applied to Banking are completely different than Bitcoin, you have to revisit the financial collapse of 2008.   
The prime reason the banking system came to a halt was because they could not trust each other to repay their debts.  They had NO idea which of their partner banks were on the verge of collapse.   They all had massive amounts of IOUs on their books, but nothing tangilable to back it. (collateral)  And they could not prove otherwise, without showing their COMPLETE books to regain trust and solvency.  An Audit!


This is the heart of the entire problem.  One bank claims that they accounted for $1 on the blockchain and issued a digital token for it, right?  Prove it!   How do we know that $1 still exists?  Banks hold gold reserves. Technically they could issue a gold token, but how do we know if the gold is redeemable?
Once a single USD or gold brick is on a blockchain, there is no guarantee or PROOF, without a complete audit, that it's redeemable.  So even if you tokenize USD, you still don't have a settlement free digital asset.  It's just an IOU and everything is based on trust again.
Bitcoin is a native digital asset, that allows you to send value instantly, with zero settlement and zero trust.  If you control the keys, then you own it.  And if someone wants you to prove it.  You sign a message with the private key, that you in fact control those bitcoins.     
The financial collapses would not have happened, if banks could prove their solvency by signing messages on their reserves.
This is the motherfucker.   This is the invention!  It's not the blockchain.  It's the token, that requires no settlement, no trust and derives it's value from the free market.  
Banks can't recreate this, because whatever they "CREATE", has to either be backed by something with counter party risk OR they have to compete in a free market against deflationary bitcoin.


What benefit is there, if you still don't have a native token with zero settlement?   All of the banks money is based on government debt.  All of it is an IOU.  
What is accomplished?      
They can claim their blockchain tech is streamlining back-end processes and settlement between all their other IOU machines, but this isn't ground breaking.  It's still settlement and reconciliation of IOUs.   
How are they going to derive a settlement free asset?
Bitcoin is a digital bearer asset.

By protect, what exactly do you mean?  What does local mean?   Does that mean geographically?  Because you can't enforce geography on the internet. (proxys, vpns)   
I think what you're saying, is that we have to signup to the local DMV blockchain so that we can transfer ownership to another "approved" party that also has records in the local DMV.   My question is, if that transaction is local, THEN WHY USE A BLOCKCHAIN?    What does that accomplish if you still put the ownership records behind a 3rd party?   
The point of a permissionless blockchain, and the only reason blockchains are interesting, is because you can remove the 3rd party completely with a smart contract.
You guys are completely missing the point of everything this technology represents.

Another example of this is Coinado for torrents.
We absolutley need many more services like this.  Audio and video conversions using ffmpeg seem like anothr good proof of concept.
I've been thinking about the next level above single services.
 If you create a hub of identitcal services, then you can connect together 100s of machines running  VMs (docker images).   I can imagine huge video files, from cloud providers or uploaded to the hub, being transcoded in parallel across many machines for a small fee.
At that point we'll all have access  to an army of machines for hire that are running well defined micro-service of all kinds.    And the awesome part is that the people running these VMs are getting compensated for it.   
I can imagine this creating a new market, that is only possible with crypto currency.

My observation is that if a transaction does not get included within 24h, they start to bitch and try to find a way to fix it.   Having the default be 2 weeks, means that the user is SOL or they have to do some complicated double spend, which majority of wallets don't even support.

That's the problem.  Big blockers don't understand how bitcoin works, or how the markets work, so they think they can magically fork and become bitcoin, but they can't do that.  All exchanges have said that they will list BU(or whatever the name is) as a new asset, which means they have an empty order book and must be shown side-by-side with Bitcoin.    That alone is a death sentence for this new coin no matter what it is.   Litecoin will have stronger network effects than the fork. 
Bitcoin is 1MB, and while I hated that fact and have rallied against it in the past (view my gilded posts), I have come to accept it, and embrace the decentralized nature of bitcoin and its resistance to change.   The consensus fights against all changes, which sucks if you think Bitcoin should scale up and change for world adoption, but it's exactly what is needed to prevent corruption and ensuring immutability.
There's no way to change this reality, unless suddenly everyone wakes up one day and decides to run this new incompatible client... which is not happening.   Most early adopters of Bitcoin are in the Segwit, L2 systems camp, so the likelihood of a big block hardfork ever becoming the majority is slim to none.
The sooner everyone realizes this, the sooner they can appreciate how this immutable bedrock sets the stage to become a perfect store of value.

BTC is a bearer instrument and can be used as collateral and settlement because you can cryptographicly prove you own it.  If you're holding an USD-IOU there isn't a guarantee that its redeemable from that counterparty.

Agreed, it's all about collateral. 
If banks had Bitcoin in 2008 and if the marketcap was high enough, then they could have lent money to their peers and requested time-locked bitcoin for the duration of the loan.
This single feature would allow them to continue operations and keep capital flowing with manageable risk.
They don't have anything like this.  
All they have are recipes for claims on assets that are held by custodians.  But all of those records were in question too. They had claims on deeds to homes, but didn't know which organization had possession of them. 
Ownership was a completely mess and they did not have anything they could put up for collateral that didn't require an audit to prove that it actually existed, they owned it and what it's value was.
That's why everything stopped.

Decentralization is to ensure censorship resistance, and immutability, so Rasb Pi's DO ADD value to Bitcoin because it makes it impossible to kill.   That property is the only reason it's lasted this long and built enough confidence that people actually put money in this experiement.

The reason is because you can stand on the backs of giants and get more done for less.

No one cares, Bitcoin is here as a hedge against reckless monetary policies.  The only way to ensure it doesn't get cooped into a corp-coin, is to keep it decentralized with tiny nodes and if that means corporations can't use it as their personal meta-data dumping ground, so be it.

A better option might be to create a Git repo and give partner banks access to it.  Each bank is only allowed to put messages in their folder. (To prevent merge conflicts)   Then on every push, Travis-CI runs a reconciliation script to ensure everything balances out.  If it doesn't pass, then the push is rejected and the bank has to resolve the merge conflict.
Now they have an private append-only(blockchain) database, that is secured via ssh keys and consensus is handled via Travis-CI.  
Someone needs to alert Github, they've been in the private blockchain business for years without even knowing it.

employee:  "But over the past year, I've learned so much and I'm alway on time and I'm kicking ass helping your business grow."
employer: "True, we are doing better, but I've had to drop prices 2% over the past year due to deflation."
employee: "Ok, but you can't reduce my pay 2% because I have more experience than a new hire.  "
employer: "Good point, but lets work this out..."

I completely agree with you.  My question is, how long before existing database providers add a "blockchain" structure that allows you to define a shared append only table, confirmed table and consensus script, to keep it all together?

So let me get this straight.  
We have a protocol upgrade ready that will give us effective ~2MB blocks, LN, sidechains, schnorr sigs, and later MAST, doesn't require a hardfork, also fixes malleability, AND can be activated in a few weeks... 
BUT WE shouldn't activate it, because of ONE miner who has a lot of hashpower and is blocking this upgrade because it disables his covert asicboost. Instead we should cater to his whims, hardfork, risk a chain split, drop approx 30% of the nodes in the process, allow this miner to keep an unfair advantage, add more load to the network, don't fix malleability, and then what?     More hardforks later? 
You honestly think that's a better direction?   
Get the fuck out of here, you dumb fuck!
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:54:39
So everything you take for granted in an inflationary environment is pretty much reversed in a deflationary one.  It doesn't mean that loans are impossible, it just means that your assumptions on how they must work need refactoring.   Instead of positive interest rate, you would have negative interest, which would be based on the current rate of deflation.   
The bigger mind fuck with a bitcoin economy is loan creation for large projects.  Currently bankers can create huge amounts of money out of thin air and deposit it into your account and you'll be able to access all of it instantly.  This would be impossible in a bitcoin world because you can't create new bitcoins at will.  Instead of receiving 1000000 bitcoins to build a space station on mars, you would create a capital flow of bitcoins (based on smart contracts) that would be delivered on some intervals.  You would then use more smart contracts to funnel that money to different aspects of the project.   If the flow drys up for what ever reason, then the project comes to a halt.  
Another example is a home loan, instead of taking a 500k home loan, you would pay a 500k/20year flow of bitcoin to pay to the seller of the house.  
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:40:59
The swift jump to bitcoin is usually prefaced with the collapse of the dollar due to a coming hyper inflationary cycle from all of the QE and zero interest rates over the past 7 years.   Who knows if that's going to happen, but there is a *slight* chance.  
The Fed keeps talking about hiking rates, but they are very wary about executing it.    The first sign of rate hikes means that the housing market will stall which usually drops us into a recession, which then requires lower rates to get us out again.  If we're already near zero and if things start to slow, then we'll have to go negative interest rate territory.  How low can we go?   
There is overwhelming evidence that China is slowing down, EU is struggling, Australia is dropping rates, and Japan is doing their own QE.   Central banks are struggling to keep their economies treading water.   The global economy is not looking very good. It doesn't take much to trigger a sell-off and then a cascade of the defaults which could cause another financial apocalypse.   
Time will tell how this plays out, but what we do know is that Bitcoin stands apart from this system and it is not based on debt.
@_date: 2017-07-15 01:58:26

The script/stored proc should be on all machines and they could run in a round robin taking turns so that no one messes with it.
Ordering of transactions on an append only table, is pretty obvious.  It doesn't matter because this is the dynamic pool anyway.  
The reconciliation script ensures that no double spends, or whatever crazy consensus rules they come up with are enforced.   Once it passes, then everything is dropped into the confirmed table and propagated using standard replication.
The incoming "block" of confirmed transactions should be doubled checked using the reconciliation script.
My point, is that if you gave the gist of how a blockchain works to a DBA, he could recreate it pretty easily.

If the financial system didn't automatically steal and depreciates everyone's labor then maybe we wouldn't need to work our entire life.  If you took one bitcoin and said that the entire global economy had to function within it, then we would see jumps in efficiency as prices drop for things. In a bitcoin system, deflation would be an indicator that we are doing more with less.  All of your hard work stays in the system and continues to accumulate generation after generation.  The reason why the rich get richer is because they benefit from inflation, you don't.  Inequality is one byproduct of inflationary economics.  The workers (middle class) are left behind as gains in efficiency are funneled to the top and then paid out to shareholders.

Their argument is to create artificial scarcity to force larger fees for the sake of the miners (security).     
My argument is that the utility that bitcoin provides (security and fast confirmations) will determine the appropriate market price and that artificial scarcity is not needed.


You are not forced to include a fee, it simply means that the ODDS of your transaction being confirmed in a timely manner drops significantly.    You must decide if you want high ODDS of it being confirmed within a few blocks.  Otherwise pay no fee and watch your transaction float in limbo for a few days.
I used the analogy to show that it's not about limited capacity that causes a consumer to pay the fee.  We pay the fee because we value a fast delivery.  We are willing to pay $99 for next day delivery.  If actual marginal cost was $500, then not as many people would use the service.  The market price is somewhere in the middle between actual cost and how much you are willing to pay.


Currently that is true, abut all you need is a web service where they can post that information.  Miners just have to publically announce their fee schedules.  I doubt miners will be on the same page at first, but eventually, they will come to a far market price for their services.


Yes, there differences.  The main difference is that with shipping you rely on a trusted company like FedEx to deliver your package on time. In return, you end up with very high certainty that they will deliver on their promise.  
With bitcoin, the best we can do is increase the odds of our transaction being confirmed next.   Miners are faceless, for the most part, so who knows who is going to confirm or ignore your transactions.  However, if a few pools that control a significant percent of the network hashing power define that it costs X to be included in the next block, then you need to pay that to increase your odds.

Segwit solves the quadratic hashing issue that zcash is experiencing which causes validation time to skyrocket.  2MB+2MB would make the matters worse.  You obviously don't understand all the different features in Segwit, if you think 2mb+2mb, is even remotely the same as segwit.  But that doesn't stop you from having an opinion in the debate and push stupid ideas like extension blocks and 2mb+2mb, out of pure fucking ignorance.

Yes, they have been saying this since day 1 and Bitcoin is still here.  It's growing in every country and allowing people from all over world to send value to each other.    When do you think they'll start writing new reports saying they were wrong?  Never, because they're not objective.  They start with the premise,  "Bitcoin will fail, because only banks can make money"  and dig up a bunch of shit to support that while completely missing the point.  These are the "experts" who think Bitcoin technology is cool, but bitcoin isn't.   That should be first sign that they don't know what they're talking about.   
Blockchain tech is not cool.  It's inefficient, overly redundant and there is no reason to ever use this data structure in a centralized system.  The network effects and incentives that keeping miners honest to secure a distributed blockchain is genius. 
Pull your head out of ass and you may learn something.

Is it?   How else could you estimate the value of bitcoin?   Current market cap is 3.2 billion and Bitcoin hasn't even begun to compete in these markets.  
Of course if velocity is very high in the remittance business, then maybe it won't affect the price much at all...  It would probably provide more liquidity and price stability.   Unless the remittance business turned into a bunch of HODLers.

The difference between someone who thinks bitcoin is silly and the trolls who have 50% buttcoin posts to generate karma and 50% bitcoin posts to troll are obvious.  These guys have made it a sport to troll.I know that you have to walk a fine line between censorship and moderation, but these buttcoiners have been a constant issue for this sub and it's getting worse.  You guys are far to lax.  Personally I can spot these guys from a mile away.  They live in /new and try to spew their nonsense from the get go of a post, derailing the comments section and causes numerous members to engage them.  They never reply with anything of value, its also some bullshit that has been covered a million times in the past and then they'll cry censorship.  You should ban these guys from the get go.  If their posting history is 50/50 between buttcoin and bitcoin, Ban them.  Buttcoin is a thriving troll community and its growing large enough to derail bitcoin on a constant basis and cause valuable and insightful posters to never come back.  Ban the buttcoiners.  They can circle jerk all they want in their own sub.

Yes, Bubbles create frenzies.  This is true in all markets.  Sure the bitcoinmarkets folks are all about the price. So what.  That's their job and the sub is dedicated to it.  They use technical analysis which says that if there is a pattern then there is a chance that it will repeat again in the future.  They thought that bubbles will keep happening because of the past bubbles.  Of course they ended up being wrong THIS time, but there's NO WAY of knowing for sure because the market is thinly traded, so it is possible for a massive rally to occur and the frenzy to happen again.      The rise to 1200 had no fundamentals behind it in hindsight, so that means that it doesn't take much to push to 1200 again.   Markets move fast with thin liquidity.  
Sure, you make good points.  Security is shit.  Our computers are a hackers paradise and now we're storing real digital cash on them.  I hope that this will cause everyone to build better software that is actually secure and that people become more aware and take precautions.   It is scary, but this is Bitcoinland and there are NUMEROUS posts warning people about all of these risk every week.    You have to take responsibility here, that's why its a libertarian paradise.  Libertarians are all about taking care of yourself and coving your own ass.   We try to have PSA about potential scams.  All of it makes it to the front page.  We don't hide it.  We don't pretend that there is no risk.  Every hack, scam, and lost coin story makes it to the front page and it's always been this way.    
I think that the Bitcoin ecosystem is growing stronger everyday.  There is a real need for the utility that bitcoin provides today.   The next few years and going to be very exciting.  Agreed, to the MOON!

Everyone knows that decentralization is the top priority of Bitcoin.  Larger nodes and higher throughput on-chain directly raise the cost to all participants.   The network gets heavy and easier for governments and corps to corral.


He is, but you don't see the big picture.   Bitcoin isn't about p2p cash, it's about maintaining an immutable ledger that the entire world can rely on to be neutral to their business.   If NYA can change it, bitcoin isn't as important as we thought.

I think the main issue is the competitive nature of humans and rival gangs.  One gang will get larger than the other and take over using force.   How can you escape this gang ?

Are we doomed to repeat this scenario over and over again?

Yes, that's the argument for small block sizes.  If the block is full then you have to pay more because space is limited.  You must essentially BID more than most other transactions to get a spot in the block.   
Many transactions will be stuck in limbo because there isn't any room for them even if they paid a reasonable fee.
It turns into a giant cluster fuck when you have a surge in transactions and get a backlog that can't get cleared no matter how much money is thrown at the miners..   A good example would be payroll which usually occurs on the 1st and 15th of every month.

Yes and that's the biggest barrier to bitcoin adoption.  The people who don't believe the government is needed, latch on to bitcoin instantly but those that believe money is a function of a government have a hard time believing it can work.  But make no mistake that it's the people who make a currency work, not the government.  If people want bitcoin to succeed then it will.  If they don't then it wont.  Simple as that.   Money is a confidence game.  Aka a con.  It's only backed by your faith that it is worth something... because pets face it, money is just pieces of paper with dead presidents on it and bitcoin is just entries in a ledger.

The alternative theory of Willey and subsequent accounts that follow similar patterns is that it was dark pool trading at MtGox.  Another words, someone asks Mark to buy coin for him, but doesn't want to be known in the exchange.  He doesn't want any records traced back to him purchasing coins.   This could have been Mark, this could have been some other nameless individual that wanted to launder cash for coin.  Maybe they gave Mark access to an offshore account with millions in it and in return he created a few fake accounts to buy coin and deliver to this person.   
The fact is that we don't who was in charge of those accounts and if the $$$ really existed in the exchange to purchase the coin.    The investigation is still ongoing and eventually they should be able to narrow down the causes.  
Simply saying Willy was created to pump the price is probably incorrect, to say the least.

Please show me a single example of a government that is not running a deficit and preaching the standard lie that 2% inflation is "good for everyone". 
Every country is running a debt based pyramid scheme economy and thinks they can continue to force growth on the backs of their aging population by handing out cheap money.  It's doomed because you aren't supposed to be able to create unlimited capital out of thin air.  Everything else on earth has real costs that prevent over supply, except fiat money.  It breaks the rules of scarcity and allows debt to be backed by debt to be backed by debt until the country looks like Greece today or has a financial crisis like 2008. 
 They have 3 choices. 
1. Austerity,  cut expenses and balance budgets 
2. Default,   giving your creditors the big fuck you and end up with junk bonds and limited ability for future financing.
3.  Pray that every creditor will just forgive your debt because they're inflating away their debt obligations away at the same time.  
Do you have any idea why the Turkish Lira used to have 20,000,000 bills that equated to about $20?  Do you remember how much a Drachma was worth before the EU?   How about Italian Lira?   All of these countries had weak currencies because they had Government spending problems.  Nothing has changed since they joined the EU.  The people of their countries suffered year after year because their officials can spend without limits and steal the wealth of their people through TAXES and then through INFLATION.
So again, please tell me more about this efficient system of debt that you support.

It's not purely speculation.  If it was pure speculation without utility and fundamentals then it would be a lottery or a game of roulette.  Those don't activities don't have any underlying usefulness beside to gamble.  Bitcoin does have utility.  It allows transfers of value that previously were impossible due to regulation, fees, boarders, etc.   Just because we haven't figured how to value that utility like a balance sheet calculation, does not mean that it must be zero.    
You would be 100% wrong if you think that bitcoin is 100% pure speculation and does nothing of value.  
The gold comparison is interesting because the price of gold has barely anything to with actual demand for it at an industrial level.  It's a symbol of wealth, which is then treated as investment against fiat inflation.  I think less than 10% of gold is actually used for industrial purposes.  Golds price is mostly speculation.


You are ignoring that fact that it has utility AND that the market is searching for a price that represents the future potential of that utility.  It's the markets job to figure this out, not you.   Obviously, if bitcoins price was $0 right now, then you would be correct.  However, that is not the reality of it.   No one is trying to trick anyone else into buying bitcoin.  It is a very interesting technology that allows value transfer outside of traditional means and is more efficient.  How much is that worth?  Do you honestly think it has no value at all?  


Hmm, no.  The fact is that volume continues to rise across all markets including OTC and more businesses are being created all the time.

I think that they are doing their due diligence, because everyone else is.    I think that blockchain tech, is simply a way of thinking about how data from multiple parties can be reconciled in a simple way.   
There's no reason they need a specialized "chain" to do this.  They can tell their DBAs that they want a blockchain like consensus and it wouldn't take much for them to create it using their existing databases and API layers.   It doesn't require specialized software and a separate team of blockchain experts to administer it. 
The difference between these "chains" and The Blockchain is trust.  If you trust these other parties then you just have to come up with A scheme, any scheme to communicate with each other.   That's it.

I don't know where you think it's a predatory construct.   That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.   Human behavior creates bubbles in every market from oil, to housing, DotCom, Tulips, roaring 20s, and bitcoin.   Of course some people lose out when it pops.  You can't stop this behavior no matter what you do.  It's just a fact of market/human behaviour.   


It's just a market.  So does this mean you guys don't understand and therefore hate free markets?  Pretty naive, but it seems to be par for the course over at buttcoin.


Bitcoin is functioning and providing utility for many users... what the token is worth is up for speculation.  That's the market trying to figure out what 21 million tokens are worth if they become the primary mechanism for value transfer on the internet.   It's not predatory..  the markets are growing stronger everyday.


It's just speculation.  There isn't anything wrong with this behavior.    You really just hate markets.  


Bitcoin allows me to send value to anyone regardless of country.  That function is valuable.  If it wasn't valuable, bitcoin would have died 6 years ago.  The price would have stayed 0 because no one would have gave a shit.   The fact is that bitcoin is growing everyday because that function is valuable.  You can't deny that.


The price will only reach zero if no one used bitcoin.  If no one valued the utility that bitcoin provides then the free market will cause the price to go to zero.  No bailouts. Everyone will sell their coins if they saw the ecosystem collapsing.  The crazy thing is how resilient the market is, even in the face of all the recent exchange hacks.   


The entire point of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust an authority.  Sure if you want to trust a company or government to handle your data, money, property, stocks, etc, then you can.  Bitcoin is an alternative.   You may think it's dumb and you're entitled to your opinion, but there are millions of people who think it's an interesting concept and are looking into the possibilities.   
How much do you think a trustless global network, that holds records of ownership, is worth?
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:29:32
It's because they missed out and now that the price is down they figure that they were right for ignoring it, so then they will continue to ignore it and talk shit about it.
Here's their thinking.  
Price surges to 1200:  Oh fuck, I was wrong.  I missed out.  My friend X was telling me about it for months.
Price drops to 200:  HAHA fucking idiots,  I knew I was smart for not looking into it.   Shit it going no where.  Just look at the price.  Derp derp derp derp derp derp!

Not really, because you're using it to reinvent the wheel, when you should be using it to reinvent transportation.   
You're up against DBAs and 60 year of database technology.  This so-called private blochchain concensus, can be achieved in many different ways using a traditional database that these companies already have deployed and have people who know how to maintain them.   You're advocating that they ditch these experts and employ a bunch of snake-oil sales men on consulting gigs selling that the latest fad.  


No, I get that, what you don't seem to get is that it already exists and these companies could use their existing relationships with Oracle, Microsoft, Postgres, etc, to achieve the same "concensus" that a blockchain would provide.    What do you think a database is?   It IS the consensus on the current state of data.   
Having a shared append only table, with a reconciliation procedure is child's play.
You are miss applying the technology. 


That's fine, but in a few months, when real data management firms realize the snake oil you guys are peddling, you will be the laughing stock of technology.

Bitcoin is country agnostic.  There's nothing the state can do about that, sans breaking the internet.   Only a few completely oppressive countries like Russia have outright banned bitcoin, but that doesn't stop their citizens from using it.  


It is happening.  Right now, under your nose.
Programmers built the internet and open technology has proven to win over closed solutions every time.  Bitcoin is open, so it will be the defacto payment solution for all programmers that don't want to deal with Paypal and other shit.

@_date: 2015-02-09 18:47:45
It's largely engineers who think about it in terms of game theory.  They think that if you have unlimited blocksize, then the cost of transactions will go to zero because there will always be a competitor that is willing to include transactions even if you're charging X.  They believe this will cause a race to the bottom and there won't be any incentive for miners to secure the network because they can't cover costs.
I think of it from the perspective of utility.   It doesn't matter how much the marginal cost is for including another transaction, it's about how much I will pay for my transaction to be confirmed within X blocks.  That's the market.  It's the same reason people pay $99 to overnight a letter, even though the marginal cost to put that letter into a plane and fly it across the US is far less.
It's not about capacity, it's about how much we will pay for the utility of fast confirmations.
IMO. =)

I know the argument. I've read it hundreds of times on here.  Everyone uses it. I've debated nullc at length about it.   I'm proposing a different way to look at the market and each time I bring it up I get positive results.   
Your argument is about miner behavior operating in a vacuum.   You only look at one side of the equation.  The supply side.    If supply is limited then the price will go up.  Obviously, but lets keep going.  We must force limited supply to ensure that people pay the fees to secure the network.  This ensure freeloaders don't take advantage of the network and undercut other miners.  It also ensure that all blocks will be as full as possible (and probably with a nasty backlog), miners will sort by fees and the network will be perfect.  
Fuck that.  Complete bullshit. No one will use it and it can't scale to meet surges in demand.
If bitcoin can not scale and provide enough utility that people are willing to pay for then it should die.  No amount of game theory on limited block sizes will save it.

Scaling for transaction throughput is fine if you want to compete with VISA.

Imagine if this was the rate schedule to send a bitcoin transaction with reasonable certainty that within X number of blocks your transaction would be confirmed.
Of course some other miner could run a charity mining operation and include all transactions, scooping up the fees, but all you need are a few big players that set fee schedules and they will mess with the ODDS of your transaction being confirmed in X blocks and you will have to pay for that certainty.  Your transaction may get lucky, but you can't count on that.

I can't ignore the interesting apps that are being created and I know that many more are on the way.  Developers will use Bitcoin over all other payment gateways eventually because it allows them to be country agnostic.  Every other payment gateway has shitty terms of service and can and will lock your funds away at any whim.   Bitcoin is freedom to do business on the internet whether it's a gambling, trading, shopping, freelancing etc.  The list is endless.  Everything that happens on the internet today can benefit from using a cryptocurrency and thus allowing anyone in the world to purchase their services.
It's an enabling technology that is just getting off the ground.  It is highly speculative as far as price is concerned because it has such thin liquidity.   Exchanges are getting better, liquidity is increasing, more markets are opening and you think it's all a pump and dump. LOL. 
There are a few individuals in this space that are sketchy, however that has nothing to do with the ecosystem that is being built.  The fact is that there are "smart" individuals/economists who write those papers that you read, who can't recognize innovation even as they hail an Uber cab.   These clowns can't recognize how big of an innovation a trustless network is and what it takes to bootstrap such a thing.   They literally think that a bank is going to create a blockchain for internal use.  LOL.  It's so hilarious.    It's like taking a solar powered flashlight into a cave.
Bitcoin is not perfect, but it works.   I have yet to see any other cryptocoin being built upon like Bitcoin.  Hash rate is still increasing and miners are still working on more efficient chips.  The whole ecosystem is flourishing and you're going to come at me with a tired ass argument like "It's all a scam dude, pump and dump!".   Get real and pull your head out of your ass.   There are scams in this sector, but it is not Bitcoin.

This could be used to collect economic data, which may give you an edge on the official data release.
For example, you could  attach a 21 Inc computer to a camera on a tripod and let people snap pictures at intervals of their choosing.  
Take pictures of ships coming and going from a port.  (counting containers)
Take pictures of popular shopping centers.  (counting cars)
If you get enough samples from around the country/world you could predict economic conditions before the governments release their reports.    There are companies already doing this with satellites and another startup named Premise that's paying people to take pictures of things.

Because they're mostly miners who want to process ALL the transactions on-chain (big blocks) so they can make the most money.   
They misunderstood the purposed of bitcoin, and why this entire system is built in such a way as to remove trusted 3rd parties.  Now they want to become the new permanent 3rd party to all our transactions and collect fees for majority of economic activity.   
However, the economics of bitcoin mining ensures that their profits will ALWAYS trend towards zero, as long as the system is trustless, meaning that new miners can entire the ecosystem and compete for the remaining profits. 
Large identifiable miners will eventually all go out of business, as mining is re-decentralized to anyone who can run a node. Especially once asicboost is neutralized.

It's just another payment rail for them.  You can ask the same question about Discover card, Amex, Stripe, Paypal, Venmo.  The payment space is getting more competitive so it's reasonable to assume Bitcoin is going to right there battling it out.

Gas stations Point of Service machines would just need a software update.   A gas station could display you a qrcode that you scan and send coin to.  It would be faster than cash if they allow zero confirmations from green addresses.

You have to think of Bitcoins as being the new gold.  So you don't loan bitcoin, you loan fiat and ask for a % of that fiat value in bitcoin to be posted as collateral. (it could be time locked, for the during of the loan)  It's roughly how pawn shops work.  But the banking system works much the same way between trusted banks.

Yes, because they are mostly miners.  They want big blocks as a way to fight against the block reward dropping to zero, and their profits reducing too.  The only way they can ensure more profits is to ensure they can process more transactions on-chain.     Off-chain (Lightning networks) competes with their business and Segwit is the first building block to enable a bunch of new off-chain use cases, which means less money for them.

You are right, I'm not and it's because of the following.


This means that people will not pay for Bitcoin because it has no utility.  It's idiotic to say this.   
How much are you willing to pay for the utility that bitcoin provides?   My personal answer is &gt; 0 and there are a shit ton of people TODAY who say the same thing.  
We are the ones paying the 'suggested' minimum fee and getting fast confirmations because of it and the blocks are not even full yet!   The market is working.  
His conclusion is complete bullshit that ignores the current market demand for fast confirmations and he specifically states it!
He setup a strawman and then beat it to death.

The 1MB proponents think that they are protecting miners by creating artificial scarcity.   They don't realize that miners will figure this out when it comes time.   1MB  for economic arguments is a premature optimization.  
For technical reasons, it puts a cap on the usefulness of bitcoin for the sake of protecting the miners.  Arguments are that the block size will be too big or propagation time will cause more orphans.  Each of which have several proposed solutions.
One hard fork for a dynamic limit is difficult enough,  imagine trying to hardfork to increase the block size to some other arbitrary value in the future.   Gavins solution is to get it over with once and let the miners figure out how they can run a profitable business later (6-20 years from now).   
If Bitcoin provides utility, then people will pay for it.

Its not a risky gamble. The use case that bitcoin is filling and people are willing to pay fees for, can not be easily duplicated or surpassed.  Dogecoin can easily be used to throw pennies around, but you cant move large sums of money through it, because it has shit liquidity and very few global connections.
If low value transactions flood over into altcoins, then it means the big money has priced them out of bitcoin because they are willing to pay for the limited block space.    That is a good thing.  
Big money will move the price up much more than moon kids, and theyll pay for the utility without bitching about variable confirmations and 10 cent fees.

It won't destroy bitcoin "today",  it will weaken the security model of the network and set a bad precedent.   
Basically segwit2x says that if a subset of miners and exchanges decide that Bitcoin is going to change, then it will.   So when governments want to change Bitcoin, they simply lean on the miners and exchanges to get what they want.   Decentralized network?  Nope.  Censorship resistant?  Nope.  Privacy? Nope.
Segwit2x is a trojan horse for all the coming fuckery that is going to ruin Bitcoins foundation.... and for what?    LOW FEES, COFFEE and a compromise for Jihan??

Its not risky.  There is zero risk in losing the onchain tipping use case or onchain coffee purchases, because they never existed in the first place because of 10 minute confirmations and shitty UX. 
In addition, small peer to peer transaction do not make sense when you start to scale up and think about the bandwidth requirements and the effect that has on decentralization.  
These use cases can thrive in level 2 solutions, like LN and become the liquity for the active economy, while L1 is left for settlement, savings accounts and large transfers.

The price of bitcoin is the barometer of that sentiment.    IMO, the fact that bitcoin is worth more than $100 proves that it has a chance to become a permanent store of value.  Market prices are based on confidence.  As the price of bitcoin goes up over time, confidence increases.  Every day that bitcoin doesn't die, confidence increases.

I accept bitcoin as money.  In fact I accept bitcoin over many other fiat currencies.  If someone tried to pay me in Russian rubles I wouldn't accept it because I couldn't do anything with it besides frame them.  I couldn't even get anyone else to accept them because I don't live in Russia.  But everyone lives on the internet and everyone can turn bitcoins into something actually want.  The market is fluid and global, so bitcoin is a better internet currency than all fiat and that is a fact.

Decent metaphor.  
Service and food will suffer if we try to service everyone.  It is impossible to keep the menu the same because there are limits on sustainable farming for all the dishes on the menu.  
People who advocate that we should service all the customers at our original location, should probably just go eat at McDonalds instead, since they don't value our unique value proposition.  Also there are real limits on the number of parking spots and roads to/from our restaurant. 
That said, we are trying to start a franchise, assuming the food will be up to our standards.  However, the companies that built the roads in the surrounding area are blocking it because they think they can charge tolls to all our customers forever.    It's really ridiculous.  We would like everyone in the world to experience our dishes and understand that it's not practical for everyone to visit this one location.

The issue is that the network couldn't handle larger blocks until various improvements were made to the protocol first.  (signature validation)   And even then, we still face the challenge of hardforking a decentralized network... that some argue shouldn't ever be hardforked unless there is 95% agreement.  Hardforking for something as ridiculous as a couple dollar fees, is ridiculous risk/reward ratio.


I can tell that you're completely ignorant to Bitcoin's history.     If you want hardforks and a leader to decide the direction of the project, there's Ethereum.

Bitcoin isn't peer to peer.    You broadcast your transaction into the network, which then floats around in mempools until a miner decides to include it in a block.  If anything Bitcoin L1 is peer to miner.  
LN, on the other hand, is peer-&gt;peer-&gt;peer-&gt;peer-&gt;peer-&gt;peer as needed.  It can be perfect peer to peer, or it can hop through a bunch of other peers.
Get your facts straight.

gawd, I sound like the rbtc dipshits in that post.  :(    I would downvote my own comments from last year if I saw them today.

Ah, no worries though because they just create more money out of thin air and refill your account.  No harm bro.  Money is infinite.

High fees?   Shut the front door!!!

this is nothing.   buy the dip

Its not elitism.  It's the market for a limited resource.   We can onboard the masses into LN. 
500mb sounds a bit high.  
How about we build LN first, see how much traction it gets, see how much fees rise/drop, see how the network is handling the stress, then plan for an appropriate throughput increase... and a hardfork if needed.
There is no reason to change the blocksize before L2 solutions are built... Especially when you acknowledge bitcoins primary use cases today and how the current fees dont mean shit to them.

Everyone wants 2x their stash of bitcoins.  Some how everyone has forgotten about scarcity.

No, thanks.  It's probably filled full of bugs and attack vectors.

What we need are awesome services that only accept bitcoin.  Something like Spotify or Twitch or WoW or Kickstarter.   the consumer has to arrive on a site and be like "fuck, I have to get some bitcoin to use this.". We need to generate real demand, not just an interest in bitcoin.

Thats it! Im officially 13 for anything I publish online.  You get so much more respect.

Before bitcoin we really didn't have a choice and it was scary to think about these scenarios.  Now, I laugh because the little guy can now store his wealth outside of the current financial system.
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:01:11
I don't consider anything that requires a hardfork "adding benefits".  It's an incompatible change that results in an altcoin.

Pretty much.  If you sent all the outputs to a coinjoin, then output them to a new address, you would be covered.

Here's a great example of capital flowing from around the world to help a small cause.  This was unheard of before Bitcoin.  The people donating can be from anywhere in the world.  No restrictions!

Why?  cars go down in value.

Daaaamn, I like this idea.   This could work for anything..  A QR code on TV, Website, Newspaper or even a billboard.
BitPay, are you on this ?
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:29:15
Bitcoin actually allows capital to flow freely around the entire world.  I can invest directly in a hardware store in Mongolia, support an organic farm in Columbia or donate directly to a charity in Cuba.  All capital controls are lifted and people will find many ways to move their wealth and invest in things you can't even imagine yet.  The little guy is going to have unlimited opportunities to do something valuable with their money.  Not just mutual funds and domestic investments.  Microloans, crowd funding, charity and Venture Capital on a global scale.
