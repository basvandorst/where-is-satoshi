It's more like: Burger King refusing to hire additional service staff to adjust to their growth, so people have to wait hours (for Bitcoin Read; weeks) to get their food. So some one made a competing restaurant with the exact same menu, but with more service staff.

It has everything to do with economics. What Core is doing is destroying Bitcoin Core as a currency. Fee's being high is 100% Core's and those who support them's fault. Their lack of understanding economics has led them to make bad decisions on the development of Bitcoin.

Where did I indicate even slightly that they are a shadowy governing body?  I'm claiming they are incompetent.
Their scaling solution have done nothing to fix Bitcoin's problems, I don't care how good developers they are if their solutions suck, which it does.

Why would you think I'm a bot?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:10:53
And that there seems to be no one that supports Core, that know anything about economics. They all seem to come to BCH, from my anecdotal experience.

You omitted the part where I included their followers in that 100%. I know how Bitcoin works.
I don't have much faith that the Lightning Network will do much to fix fee problems, even if it's pushed to it's theoretical limits. But we'll see when/if it get's fully implemented.

I don't know what you are implying since your typing and grammar skills are horrible. But before the deal, there was a stalemate between the proposed solution to the scaling issue and SegWit was not the leading proposal. After the deal, there was full support for SegWit AS PER THE DEAL. Now that SegWit has been activated, those opposed to 2x have gone in full swing to spin their narrative to demonize the 2x part, effectively breaking the deal that got them SegWit in the first place.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:42:09
You are correct, as far as I can see, my bad.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:03:02
That's because you don't matter, but the people that matter in Bitcoin made that agreement.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:59:01
I did not agree to SegWit either, but in order to move on, a deal was made to implement SegWit and later 2x.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:13:33
Cool so me, and I voted against SegWit with my node, and after the agreement I switched my bits to support it and SegWit2x so we could move on. If you don't want a hard-fork then don't vote for it. Just realize that SegWit would never have been a thing without that deal.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:00:54
I know, but that was the deal, to get support for SegWit was the intention to implement 2x as well.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:28:59
If I'm not mistaken, the 8mb blocksize is the default setting and can be changed on a whim with ABC. So increasing block size to 80mb could easily be done, when people see the need.

If you can't buy small stuff like Coffee, it's bloody useless as money and will be replaced with something that can. Most people are not investors.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:37:57
There would be no SegWit without that deal.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:42:29
Damn, I'm getting paid? When do I get my check?
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:30:15
Thanks for this. It's the first explanation that I've seen that lays out why 2x is a problem without resorting to conspiracy theories or actors with malicious intend.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:38:03
SegWit and 2x was a package DEAL, how can it possible be a takeover.

I'd very much like to be a paid shill, where do I sign up?
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:02:20
I bought some bitcoins back when we topped 1000$+ some years ago, and it almost immediately crashed after that. I kept the Bitcoin's since then on the exchange and now we're at 2000$+. Very bad decision for me short term, but turned out fine in the long run.
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:51:47
we'll see, every other major increase has been followed by a crash :P
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:38:46
inb4 crash to 1000
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:43:29
What makes you think SegWit will "bring back the builders" ?
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:32:05
Seems you've been doing it wrong then.
