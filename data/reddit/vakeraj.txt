You're not addressing the issue even remotely. You're literally just citing what "people say."
Bitcoin does not share any of the features of a traditional Ponzi scheme. The people who called it a Ponzi were idiots who said that reflexively with no knowledge.
Onecoin displays **all** of the features of a Ponzi scheme: recruitement by members who were themselves recruited by someone higher up, an official Onecoin organization, promises of huge returns by members of that organization, sales of some nebulous product (educational packages), fancy conferences with chants and motivation speakers, little to no mention of technical specifics, etc.

You're 100% right. Bitcoin is **not** slower than bcash, it's more expensive. If you pay Bitcoin's higher mining fee (which gives you access to a more secure blockchain), your transaction will confirm, on average, just as fast as bcash.

@_date: 2016-04-17 19:05:49
I think the Bitcoin Uncensored guys covered this pretty well in their [conversation with James]( Basically, mining is based in China because it's the most efficient location. Why?
1. Energy is heavily subsidized
2. People can convert their cheap electricity into fungible value (Bitcoin) for the purpose of evading capital controls
The minute the Chinese government attacks Bitcoin by seizing mining operations, they'll just relocate to another jurisdiction. Bitcoin will always have just enough decentralization to prevent a takeover of the network, but not much more than that (because decentralization is inherently inefficient).

The yelling is at companies with tens of millions of venture capital that loudly whine about fees, but don't implement a basic upgrade that has been available for over a year.
I'd also like to point out that those Core devs were the ones that invented, tested, and coded up SegWit. All these loud whiny CEOs had to do was implement something that someone else gave them for free.

Private blockchains don't make any sense whatsoever, even in the context of private networks. There's no benefit to arranging data into blocks if you're not using proof of work. "Blockchain" is a buzzword disguised as a plan.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:13:13
And what happens when thousands of transactions are being sent per minute? Either it becomes more expensive, or the blocksize rises until nodes drop off the network and mining centralizes. Blockchains do not scale without second layers.

Dude, ETH and XRP are ICOs. Ethereum ICOd in 2014, guys like Vitalik and Joe Lubin got instantly rich by creating their own currency out of thin air and gifting themselves the early shares. And the vast majority of XRP was gifted to Ripple, for free. Their entire business model is pumping the coin using fake partnerships and announcements so they can sell out for real money.
Litecoin was less unethical, there was no premine, but it was still built on lies like ASIC resistance.

HODL just means hodl at the current price. As the price goes up, some investors stop hodling. That's how it works. Encouraging people to hodl is just the same as saying don't accept a price this low.

That scenario doesn't make sense. If everyone hodls at a given price, the price goes up until the marginal price at which someone doesn't hodl. You're describing something that can't possibly happen. 


Again, this makes no sense if you've actually studied economics. There's no such thing as "no supply," because we know there are people who control the private keys to bitcoins. Demand doesn't have to "ramp up." As long as there is some supply and some demand, there is a market price.

All of those are features Bitcoin Core has developed, but wallets are laggards at adopting, which would greater enhance users' experience.
1. RBF = replace by fee = you can speed up stuck transactions
2. connect to a full node so that you don't need to rely on third party nodes
3. multisignature = many people have to sign the transaction before it can be sent (like 3 out of 5, or 7 out of 7 private keys)
4. Bech32 = new addressing format with various small enhancements
5. SegWit- I don't need to explain this one, do I?
Bottom line is, a wallet (but especially a hardware wallet!) that takes **full** advantage of all the features of Bitcoin Core would be awesome. But it takes a lot of engineering resources (which Microsoft has) to realize that dream.

Ok, but a person would have to be physically present at the game. This isn't broadcast on tv. And they'd have to lift their hand to aim their phone/laptop at the jumbotron. It really comes down to who in the audience has the fastest reflexes.

One day it'll be the Miami Heat, the next game it's the Sacramento Kings, after that the NY Rangers. We could just flash the QR code without any pre-announced warning.

It's not waiting on Bitcoin to "get its shit together." Any coin that wants to be worth a damn has to fix its flaws before it can go mainstream. Big blocks are worthless if only large miners can deal with the increased rate of orphan blocks and the regular forks that will occur. You're trying to pick the quick and easy, but wrong, path to scalability. Genuine scalability requires hard programming work, testing, and bug fixes. What you're doing is jeopardizing Bitcoin's future for some dumb hypothetical short term price gain.

You're right. There are opposing forces at work here. The expected miners revenue should be:

Ummm, so I'm actually in medicine. And trust me, your layperson that spent 30 minutes googling a topic doesn't know shit about health care. Most people with hypertension are not qualified to say if they should be on a thiazide diuretic, a loop diuretic, a beta blocker, a calcium channel blocker, an ACE inhibitor, or an ARB, let alone what dose they should be on. There are some things that only come with years of studying and hands-on experience. 
And the same goes here. Watch this [speech]( by Greg Maxwell and tell me you carry even a fraction of his knowledge on Bitcoin. Your average reddit bitcoiner doesn't actually know shit about bitcoin, and probably isn't a frequent user. In fact, they're most likely a speculator with dollar signs in their eyes which is why they support raising/eliminating the blocksize cap: it's a get-rich-quick scheme to them.
Experts are experts because they've spent years doing nothing but working on a specific area. Economists call this division of labor. Almost no one understands Bitcoin as well as Greg Maxwell or Peter Wuille, and that's why they're held in such high regard by the development community. And until I see a preponderance of Bitcoin experts support something besides Core, I'm not going to hastily cast aside their opinions.

Probably wallet companies would do this, as a means of advertising their software. And I imagine it'd have a pretty good download-to-cost ratio compared to other forms of advertising.

Two points:
1. The credit card infrastructure that exists can be built on top of Bitcoin. And indeed, I fully expect someday for AMEX, Visa, and Mastercard to enter this space. What they'll do is vet customers, create their own wallet, and then offer a service to vendors to guarantee the validity of payments, thereby eliminating the risk of 0-confirmation transactions. Some merchants may come to demand that you use a service like that for face-to-face instant transactions.
2. Those protections (reversibility) come at a significant cost. Visa, Mastercard, and AMEX all charge non-negligible fees to merchants as well as the interest they earn unpaid bills. This is fat that could be cut out.

The price of a good or service or asset increases until the quantity demanded equals the quantity sold.

End of story.

Where is the evidence that another system will pass Bitcoin by? I'd rather have patience and do things the right way- work out the bugs, add new features- and only turn to raising the blocksize **after** we've exhausted methods that don't feature the tradeoffs inherent with raising the blocksize limit.

b. Primarily reliant on personal attacks. They tend to base their arguments on some nebulous theory about how Blockstream is corrupt and trying to destroy Bitcoin so that they make a lot of money off their own scaling solutions (can anyone explain that one to me???).

I've said this before and I'll say it again: a reddit where it costs some small amount to post links and comments, or to up/down vote, but for which you receive the money from upvotes given to your link or comment would be the best. Traditional voting is good, but incorporating markets- i.e. incentivizing people to be judicious with how they post and vote- will produce the best content and commentary. And best of all, it can run on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:28:33
Sure, but does Gavin know more than Peter Wuille, Nick Szabo (created Bitgold), Adam Back (invented Proof of Work), Gregory Maxwell, Peter Todd, Bram Cohen (invented BitTorrent), etc? Without those guys, Bitcoin wouldn't even **exist**.
Make no mistake, Gavin and Mike are in the minority. Only by utilizing populist tactics (manipulating non-technical Bitcoiners), which gives the illusion of a large majority supporting their position, have they even gotten this far.

You hit the nail on the head. Any trend in society- cultural, political, technological- occurs because people "feel" it's catching on.

@_date: 2015-06-25 00:42:38
Exactly. Financial "innovation" prior to bitcoin was around creating more and more risky assets, like CDOs or subprime mortgages. Any geniune innovation that challenged the status quo firms (Goldman, BofA, JP Morgan, Citi) was regulated out of existence via the Fed, SEC, DoJ, Treasury Dept, or any number of other captive agencies. Bitcoin finally unleashed a new space where, even if something doesn't work, it could be **tried**.

If the swing is to the upside, I don't know why I'd stop at $5000.

The fundamental problem here is that there are too few highways here, i.e. ISPs. The modern cable/dsl duopoly in each community is a product of a myriad of local regulations that keep competition for these companies low. Google Fiber didn't pick Kansas City/Austin/Provo by accident- these cities agreed to waive their thick book of regulations to let Google come in and compete on a fair playing field. So if you want to complain about losing net neutrality, don't blame the ISPs, blame the government which hands them a market captured by regulation and refuses to realize the consequences.

Do you not see oleganza's point? Currently, only cash-based businesses can easily evade taxes. Cash has its natural limitations- it must be stored someplace, it's liable to theft, you can't buy this online with it, etc. Bitcoin takes the ease of cash and moves it online. Suddenly, businesses can hide an unlimited amount of money from taxing authorities, they don't need to transport it, and they can use the Bitcoin to buy virtually anything from anywhere. All the limitations of cash are solved.

Bitcoin, in this case, would first be used by illegal businesses: drugs, online gambling, prostitution. Then it would spread to small businesses that want to avoid taxes. I'm thinking of my local Chinese take out that only accepts cash.

Economics 101 dictates that, in the long run, economic profits are zero. This is perfectly applicable to mining. If miners are making a ton of money on transaction fees from someone trying to clog the system, that will incentivize the entry of new miners (because there is no barrier to entry, apart from purchasing the mining rig/electricity). Eventually, occupying the network will get progressively more expensive for that entity, until it is completely unsustainable. They'll stop their attack, miner's fees will fall, and some miners will once more have to exit the market.

You're confusing two very different forms of regulation.
Public roads are planned, constructed, and owned by the government (although financed with stolen money- taxes). Requiring some license to use them isn't a ridiculous proposition. 
Seeking investors for a business venture, on the other hand, does not use public infrastructure. It is a voluntary transaction between two parties. Government intervention here is wholly unnecessary, and the whole point is to limit competition with existing firms (the Goldman Sachs, JP Morgans of the world) while occasionally extorting men like Eric Voorhees.
Corruption isn't a problem of government, it's an inherent feature. Whenever you hand one entity an exclusive monopoly on violence, corruption will inevitably follow.

These people had the vision and foresight to buy Bitcoin when it was virtually unknown and/or routinely mocked. They learned the technical aspects of storing and transacting Bitcoin back when many of the user-friendly wallets and services were not around. They held and didn't panic through the numerous crashes. They resisted the temptation to spend their newfound spoils (10000 BTC pizza anyone?).

If own a pizza shop and the pizza shop next to mine is offering pizza's 20% cheaper because they're evading taxes (but I don't know it), you're damn right I'm going to start finding ways to cut my expenses. Starting with the 300lb gorilla called government that taxes a huge cut out of my revenue and profits. 
The tax evasion won't become full-blown overnight. My customers will at first bug me to take Bitcoin, so I'll start researching it. I'll accept maybe a few bucks per week at first, then maybe a few hundred. Eventually, while the tax collectors go crazy trying to stop every individual and business in town from hiding their income stream, tax evasion will become damn near ubiquitous. Once you throw in coin mixing services, decoy addresses, and alt-coins with better privacy features, crypto currencies will make hiding income a cinch.
Need an example? Torrents. Commonplace, and no one cares about the potential consequences.
This is what's coming within the next 10-20 years, you better be damn well ready for it.

I've never made a transaction there, but if you're a seller of BTC, I think a good way to avoid getting scammed with counterfeit dollars is to insist you meet near a public ATM and watch them withdraw the money themselves.
BTC buyers, though, I feel wouldn't get scammed because BTC can't be counterfeited.
Also, break a large transaction up into several smaller ones, just to avoid the possibility of losing a lot of money.

Merchants, in general, have not done a good job of incentivizing Bitcoin use by their customers. The truth is that many Bitcoin holders believe the price will rise tremendously. Simultaneously, merchants are saving on transaction fees, but not passing those savings on. Until this changes and stores start offering steep discounts for Bitcoin use, there's simply no reason to spend your Bitcoins when dollars do just fine.

This myth that Milton Friedman somehow abetted a mass murderer like Pinochet has to stop. It's the left way of taking a subtle dig at Friedman without actually engaging him on the issues, and it's akin to taking shots at Krugman because he was once an Enron advisor.
Friedman (but mostly the Chicago Boys) gave Pincochet **economic** advice. Get that? That means advice with respect to taxes, spending, business regulation, monetary policy. **Not** how to round up 50 dissidents and kill them. There's a big difference.
And guess what? It was probably Friedman's free market policies that ultimately led to Pinochet's downfall. The country because so prosperous under the Chicago plan, the people started rioting for freedom. Poor, tired, huddled masses are easily ruled.

**Thank you** for pointing this out!!!! Everything about Warren Buffett's personality and investing strategy is an act. Buffett's *awww shucks I'm just an old man from Nebraska who lives in the same house and drives the same car and doesn't invest in anything too complicated* schtick is so overplayed by the media. First of all, when you're a jet-setting billionaire, you can afford chauffeured limousines as well as 5-star hotel suites. But more importantly, Buffett's investing strategy is much more savvy and politically connected than he lets on. For example, Buffett negotiated a huge chunk of Goldman Sachs in the midst of the financial crisis for dirt cheap. And part of the reason Obama rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline was to increase demand for Burlington Northern's services, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.

The Ugandan farmer is merely an example. It could be a software programmer in Bangalore. A basket weaver in the Phillipines. A writer in Ukraine. Doesn't matter who. Enabling these people to buy and sell their goods and services anonymously, in a way that can't be blocked or reversed is an unbelievable innovation. No longer are these persons disconnected from the global economy. Their savings can't be drained by bank fees, inflation, or just outright theft. 
Your criticisms have little to do with Bitcoin, and fail to see the big picture. That's okay, because very few people in 1993 could see what the internet would develop into. The ability to engage in commerce is the opportunity to lift oneself out of poverty. That's why Bitcoin is valuable.

Bitcoin needs to first take advantage of those cases where it is the only option- online gambling, darknet markets, etc. Then it'll be used by small businesses to skirt on their taxes and pay employees under the table (I like to think of my local Chinese take out, which I'm sure is staffed by undocumented immigrants). Finally, it should tackle remittance markets where users are robbed with high transmission fees. Only after these phases should we even think about entering traditional retail.

There's lots of Google results. Do your own research. Even if Willybot wasn't real (which it was), no person in their right mind would take one outlying data point- a brief &lt; 1 week spike in the price- and use that as an isolated starting point for their analysis. The Bitcoin price today is higher than ever and done enormously well for the last 17 months.

As long as there are sufficient nodes to handle the demand to retrieve very old, untouched addresses.

Likewise, most human innovations wouldn't exist- mass air transit, electronics, etc.- because all of these companies depend on financing.
Besides, antibiotics only cover one narrow type of healthcare issue, namely bacterial infection. They are useless in other medical issues- viral infections, heart failure, cancer, etc. Sure, antibiotics are extraordinarily important, but they are not the end all be all of healthcare.

Buy Bitcoin at a steady amount in a regular interval (dollar cost averaging). This will mostly protect you from volatility, depending on how often you purchase.

Bitcoin is used pitifully little in retail transactions (hence Bitpay's woes), but it is still the dominant currency of the dark net.

Your raspberry pi is not the totality of the system. There are thousands of raspberry pis just like yours running Bitcoin. The costs of Bitcoin is the cost of operating all of those nodes, plus the operation of all those miners running the expensive proof of work algorithm.

Please tell me where Satoshi promised you cheap payments.
Bitcoin is not cheap to operate. Just cause you've gotten used to free or nearly-free payments over the past few years doesn't mean that's the way it's always going to be. Someday, fees will be $50 per transaction. Why? Because **blockchains are expensive**. It is expensive as hell to have a decentralized ledger, with every transaction being verified by thousands of nodes. Centralized databases are way more efficient. Nothing you say is going to change that economic reality.

Please link me to this "business model."
Blockstream has $21 million from Reid Hoffman, a multibillionaire. That's peanuts to him. He has explicitly stated that his goal in financing Blockstream is to build out the Bitcoin infrastructure. 
Every Blockstream development is open source. Even if they run Lightning hubs, for example, anyone else is welcome to run a hub and compete with them. They will have no competitive advantage. Hell, they don't even have the only implementation of LN, the original creators Tadge and Joseph have their own version.
Like Andreas has said, the worst thing that can happen here is to "assume bad faith." That's precisely what you're doing. Instead of debating Core vs. Classic on technical issues, you're distracting by calling the other team corrupt. It's a cheap cop-out conspiracy theory.

Why would anyone trust them after the Hearn debacle?
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:44:11


No, there's just a lot of reddit accounts calling for increasing the blocksize. Let me give you a hint: r/bitcoin and r/btc are not the people who use bitcoin. If you want to see bitcoin users, go over to r/darknetmarkets. And they don't care about spending even $0.50 cents on a transaction, because they're coming to bitcoin for something they can't find anywhere else: **uncensorable, trustless transactions.** That's what bitcoin is for.


Actually it will, it's just a matter of degree. You'll lose a little bit of decentralization for a little bit of increased capacity. That's all. But the more important point here is that, by engaging in a contentious hard fork, you're proving that Bitcoin is no longer a stable platform. Now, every parameter is up for debate- 10 min block times, 21 million coins, etc. Just to gain a small amount of additional capacity, you've undermined the whole project.

@_date: 2016-03-05 19:05:48
The problem is that too many people got used to the idea of Bitcoin as a cheaper payment option. Even worse, many businesses (Bitpay) were built around the concept of being Visa, but cheaper.
This is completely wrong. Bitcoin is not cheaper than credit cards, it's much more expensive. It is much more costly to record a transaction across thousands of nodes, some of which may be adversarial, than it is to record a transaction in a singular, centralized, trusted database.
So why do we put up with this? Freedom. Bitcoin allows us to do things that weren't possible before. We can now have dark net markets. We can evade the blockades against Wikileaks and Backpage. We can get our money out of countries with strict capital controls. But to do any of these things, we must be willing to pay the price of using the network.
Bitcoin will scale eventually, but it's going to take higher layers to get there. Because I highly doubt blockchains alone can achieve that.

Like I said, any advancements in bandwith and storage will apply to centralized databases too. In terms of scalability, Bitcoin needs to advance *faster* than the banks, and the only way to do that is Lightning Network. And we need to improve fungibility, which is why we must implement Confidential Transactions. Both being worked on by Blockstream and Core.
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:43:05
Precisely. If Classic supporters believe Core is doing such a bad job, why don't they just fork right now? Why do they have to wait for some arbitrary 75% threshold?

Nice strawman, Erik. I guess that's the only way you can win a debate.
Reputable exchanges examine the assets they list for sale. They require strict accounting practices, background checks on executives, and quarterly reports at a bare minimum.
What does Shapeshift do, in comparison? Nothing. Do you examine the claims of the assets listed? No. Do you examine how genuinely anonymous DASH transactions are, for example? No. Do you look at the actual uses for Siacoin or Vericoin or Potcoin? No. Do you see how genuinely decentralized these tokens are, or if decentralization is just a buzzword they use to win investors? No. Do you ban the blantantly scammy practices of ICOs or premines or instamines? No. 
Yelling "FREEDOM" doesn't absolve you of responsibility to your customers. You'll pump anything for a profit Erik. Which is ideal for this space because it's filled with noobs that have no technical capacity to evaluate claims. That makes you a scam artist.

Why aren't we discussing the blocktime then? Or the 21 million cap? The only reason you and thousands of other redditors give a damn about blocksize is because you've been relentless propagandized into believing it's some sort of life-or-death emergency. It's not. Fees are still extraordinarily low (I sent a 4 cent transaction yesterday, confirmed in the very first block). And even if they were a lot (10x) higher, it still doesn't matter, because the primary userbase of bitcoin, dark net markets, cannot use traditional methods of finance. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 23:42:33

1. BTCPHD's argument is that the poor **don't have** disposable income- they're too busy living paycheck-to-paycheck to invest.
2. Not really. Austrians argue that inflation is not accurately measured by CPI, PPI, because it is a **dynamic** process- inflation is felt least by those who spend the newly created dollars first (financial institutions that are lent the money by the Fed), and that it progressively increases as those dollars are spent and re-spent throughout the economy. This does not apply to Bitcoin because new bitcoins are not created arbitrarily, but rather by a systematic, predictable process.

Experts are experts because they spend time developing their knowledge. If you haven't once looked at the Bitcoin source code, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Spending hours arguing about the blocksize on reddit does not make you knowledgeable about Bitcoin or even the blocksize debate. Have you even once gone to the [github]( and read the Bitcoin code?

Lightning Network ultimately settles on the blockchain. Might Blockstream offer related services- sure, but who cares? It's an open-source program- anyone can utilize their work. 
That $21 million in funding is nothing to a multi-billionaire like Reid Hoffman. He has said, over and over, that the purpose of Blockstream is to build out Bitcoin's infrastructure. That's what they're doing: reviewing code, inventing Seg Wit &amp; Confidential Transactions, and building up LN. And you have no ground to stand on considering that Mike Hearn works for R3CEV, a direct competitor to Bitcoin, run by a guy who regularly bad mouths Bitcoin to VCs and the media.

I'm not saying the *nobody* on the bigger blocks size is technical, but rather, that their solution to scaling *sounds* a lot simpler and thus inherently appeals to a wider audience. It's kinda like why Bernie Sanders get a lot of support; his "solutions" for societal issues, like education and healthcare, sound straightforward- let's just raise taxes on the rich and provide those things for free to the poor and middle class. Simple, right? But you and I have a deeper understanding of Austrian economics, unintended consequences, regulatory capture, etc. We get that this "simple" solution is the wrong one.

Satoshi wasn't wrong, per se. But we have 5 years more experience in blockchains than he did.

And for what it's worth, the most likely Satoshi (and one of Satoshi's most prominent influences), Nick Szabo, completely agrees with me that raising the blocksize is a bad idea. And the inventor of hashcash, whom Satoshi cites in the white paper, Adam Back, also agrees with me.

This is so so so awesome. Fungibility is the most important issue facing Bitcoin at this moment, not scalability. Once we can get bitcoins to be much more like "E-cash," then the true benefits of this platform can be realized. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:36:45
Speak to people who actually follow the development process in-depth. It's well-known that Mike Hearn persistently floated awful ideas, that he undermined fungibility at every turn, and then when nobody paid any heed to him, he started whining and went and made his own fork. And then, when even that failed, he goes and blabs about how Bitcoin has failed to the New York Times instead of departing with grace and dignity. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:00:58
One of the common refrains around r/btc is that Adam Back failed to get involved in Bitcoin early (despite Satoshi having emailed him in 2008), which means he shouldn't be treated as an expert. 
I'd also like to point out that it's remarkably humble of Dr. Back to acknowledge that his own invention, Proof of Work, doesn't scale without higher layers. Contrast this with Vitalik Buterin, who acts like he's solved every problem in computer science with a wave of his wand.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:55:22
ETH can hard fork easily cause anyone remotely skeptical of Vitalik was weeded out in the first one.
Also, ETH is a pump and dump. There's no real commerce conducted on that platform.

I presume that if such a route exists, the software will automatically find that route.


What kind of vendor that wants to receive uncensorable transactions enters into an exclusivity agreement with a hub that adheres to KYC/AML?
I find it more likely that we'll have an equilibrium between the two- use hubs for legal activities, and then more surreptitious routes for other transactions that *need* censorship resistance.

@_date: 2016-01-22 21:18:02
You're right. The Core devs vet each others ideas. All of the code they write is open source. And ultimately, miners and nodes must choose to run their code. I'd call that a pretty good set of checks and balances, even if I myself don't understand every concept.

Bitcoin is not meant for coffee. People today have **no** trouble buying coffee with their cash or credit card. It's meant for transactions that cannot occur by any other means. The transactions that are illegal and targeted by governments. The dark net.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:08:43
Because Bitcoin is not a consumer-facing product. Satisfying consumers is the jobs if wallets, exchanges, and other members of the ecosystem. The job of Bitcoin developers is to create a robust platform for various businesses to build upon.
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:10:17
But any blockchain that has creates more blocksize space for transactions will inherently have less security. I think that's ok, but it should be acknowledged that you're using a lower-security network.

Lol, I'm an ancap and the last thing from a central planner. But I also get that blockchains have their inherent technical limitations, and that the only way to genuinely scale is to build layers above them that don't require us to broadcast every transaction to every node, as well as to use the existing blocksize more efficiently.

So, if not Gavin, who the hell is in charge of Classic? What is their long-term scaling roadmap, outside of raising the blocksize? Will they be building higher order layers to go above the Blockchain? How many programmers that thoroughly understand blockchains do they have lined up and will they be working full or part-time? What is their fix for transaction malleability? How do they plan on improving fungibility?
So many unanswered questions.

These are fundamentally technical issues. Not everyone has a degree in computer science and is going to understand it. For example, I work in medicine. Occasionally, I have to tell a patient a diagnosis. Am I supposed to sit down and run through all of their labs, radiology, and other findings to prove my diagnosis to them? Obviously not, and I know of no doctor that does this. On some level, you have to take on an element of faith in your provider. In medicine, the patient trusts things like the Hippocratic Oath, competition with other physicians, and if need be, the medical malpractice process. In Bitcoin, we have Core developers that check each other's work, as well as the miners/nodes choosing what software to run. But there's a fundamental information asymmetry here, and no amount of "communication from the Core devs" is gonna solve that.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:15:37

So you think a brand new consensus mechanism should be assumed that it works, without any real world evidence? Despite the fact that devs have identified numerous very simple attack vectors?
Bitcoin works because of Proof of Work. That's the consensus mechanism behind blockchains, even Satoshi said so. You can't just wave your wand and say that we no longer need the most critical part of a functioning blockchain.

The purpose of Segregated Witness is to finally fix transaction malleability. The scaling benefits are purely coincidental. 
There is no blocksize crisis. Fees are still cheap. Fungbility, not scalability, is the most important issue facing Bitcoin today. The benefit of bitcoin users, miners, wallets and exchanges for demonstrating *patience* and allowing the current roadmap to play out will provide immense benefits. We will have scaling (SW, LN, IBLT), we will have genuine fungibility (Confidential Transactions + Coinjoin), and we will have fixed transaction malleability. And all this will be done in a much safer way, via soft forks. Unfortunately, patience is in short supply these days and populist rhetoric is appealing to the masses.

Lol, none of the people you mentioned have made any contribution to Bitcoin in two years. They didn't invent Confidential Transactions, Lightning Network, Segregated Witness, etc. The 40+ Core developers did that. Hearn actively betrayed this project, badmouthing it to the New York Times. Satoshi hasn't been heard from in years, and anyone can cherry-pick quotes to support their cause. The most likely Satoshi, Nick Szabo, is completely opposed to XT/BU/BC. And the attacks on Blockstream are ridiculous; two years ago Bitcoiners were whining that we didn't have enough funding for development, and now that we have a company that's financed and dedicated to building out the infrastructure, suddenly they're "corrupt?" Give me a break. Blockstream only employs like 6 of the core developers, and all of their work is open source- anyone is welcome to copy it. You know what's a conflict of interest?

You're just stating your own nebulous personal opinions that have no relation to the genuine limitations of a blockchain architecture. Blockchains cannot scale to include all of the world's transactions; that's a fact. Requiring thousands of nodes/miners to record every transaction will never be as efficient as a centralized database. Therefore, we shouldn't try to compete on that measure. The **only** way this project works is if the base layer, the blockchain, remains decentralized, and then other transaction layers, some trusted (banks) and some trustless (Lightning), are built on top.
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:59:53
Roger has no ability to grasp the tradeoff between scaling on-chain and the underlying security of the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:11:32
"Technical reason" merely means a reason that Bitcoin is better than traditional options for that particular transaction. 
Satoshi designed bitcoin as a censorship-resistant payment method.  Want to know who **needs** Bitcoin? Dark net markets. Prostitutes. People in dictatorial regimes evading capital controls. Etc. That's who Bitcoin is for. No government on earth is trying to block your cup of coffee. Maybe in the future, when payment channels and lightning network becomes more commonplace, then we can expand to other use cases, but until then, if you want your transaction in the blockchain you need to stop complaining and pay up.
Another note: this challenge will face all cryptocurrencies because they all face the same fundamental limitations of the blockchain.

Classic hasn't released their code, yet, but we know they want to do a hard fork to 2 MB. Okay, let's say they get that. Then what? Hard fork again to 4 or 8 or 20 MB? How do they plan on improving fungibility? How do they plan on fixing transaction malleability? How they plan on **genuinely** scaling bitcoin to tens of thousands of transactions per second (because no, raising the block size by 2x or 20x does not accomplish that)? Or are they just going to hard fork the network and then go back and copy all of the solutions Core is already building and testing like SegWit, Lightning Network, and Confidential Transactions?

I kinda disagree. SegWit is a really, really big upgrade for Bitcoin. It fixes a **lot** of problems and opens up the door for Lightning Network, which has a good shot and becoming viable. I'd be okay to risk the network splitting over this, simply because the non-SegWit chain would be drastically inferior from the get-go, and eventually die out as users shift to the SegWit chain. I necessarily have said the same for smaller upgrades, like CSV. And that gap will only widen since Core devs (the largest development group) have such a talent gap over competing devs.

Bitcoin is a broadcast network. The Internet is not. That's why the Blockchain inherently won't scale- every node must record every transaction.

You mean the way XT supporters have been hurling insults at Maxwell for months now?
R3 is a definite conflict of interest. What is Blockstream's conflict? Saying they're crippling bitcoin to help LN is like saying I'm going to pop my car tires so that the engine gets more work.

We've been discussing private blockchains this entire thread, none of which use proof of work. Don't blame me that you're not paying attention.

Of course. Roger is a politician. He is appealing to the uninformed with rehearsed talking points and lowest-common-denominator rhetoric.

Because raising the blocksize is like deciding you need to get from LA to New York by driving at 200 mph. It's using brute force to solve a problem that can have serious consequences (crash and burning, or destroying decentralization). Using the Lightning Network is like boarding an airpline. It's the smart, creative solution that is much more efficient and sustainable in the long term. Bitcoin is a 7 year old project that needs time to develop.

I tend to think that stocks, bonds, real estate, and many other traditional investments are wildly overvalued because they serve as ways to protect your wealth from inflation. If Bitcoin succeeds, it will deflate that bubble, and their values will decline considerably.

Blythe Masters is clearly competent when it comes to banking, but for blockchains she's utterly clueless.

We do have a development decentralization. There's Litecoin, Dash, Ethereum, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited developers, etc. But most people willingly choose to use the product put out by Bitcoin Core.

Ummmm, some of those women are just as bad as Perianne. For example, Blythe Masters would probably also do poorly in an interview that challenged her technical competence. She leads a "private blockchain" company for Christ sakes! Blythe is the business arm and Perianne is the regulatory arm of the same nonsensical beliefs.
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:11:37
No one is "priced out." The fees are high **because** people demand to use bitcoin, and they do so **because** it's the most secure blockchain. If you want an insecure blockchain that can be modified at the whim of political interests, go use the dollar or Ethereum.

Raising the blocksize doesn't necessarily add more users. And it compromises security for negligible scaling benefit.

Please explain what the advantage of bundling transactions into blocks are relative to traditional databases. There's no evidence that, once existing regulations are applied to this space, it won't be just as slow, expensive, and cumbersome as the status quo.

The Fed's experts are academic economists. They make quasi-economic/political decisions. Bitcoin is a computer science project, first and foremost. If you have bad code, the project will fail. Conflating the two types of experts is disingenuous at best. Your average Bitcoin user has no understanding of UTXOs, Proof of Work vs Stake, etc. The only reason you even care about the block size is because Gavin and Mike Hearn told you to.
@_date: 2016-06-20 01:16:58

Coinmarketcap is one of the chief reasons there is the weird perception of a cryptocurrency industry, when in reality it’s Bitcoin and a bunch of garbage.
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:34:00
Blockchains simply aren't good at scaling. That should be painfully obvious to anyone that gets how they work. Running a global ledger where **every** node must record **every** transaction is inefficent by design. Only through innovations that don't use the blockchain, like Lightning Network, do we achieve genuine scaling (with almost none of the tradeoffs!).
@_date: 2017-01-07 07:39:19
As a long-term hodler, it makes me wonder who these people buying and selling so much are. Do they not realize how revolutionary Bitcoin is? What a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity it is to own a whole Bitcoin?

Yeah, but this goes beyond being technically competent regarding what a blockchain is. Her entire organization would have to change. The CDCC is fully on-board with this private blockchain ridiculosity, promoting companies like Chain and Digital Asset Holdings. If she actually understood what a private blockchain is and acted on her newfound knowledge, those cushy gigs repeating talking points in front of [the Fed]( or Congressmen would be over.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:34:46
Monero has lower fees because it is less used. And because ring signatures create larger transactions, meaning it doesn't scale as well.

Because, as many Core developers have pointed out, and I tend to agree, there are fewer tradeoffs associated with offchain scaling. I'd rather keep the base layer, the blockchain, decentralized, and build both trustless (Lightning) and trusted (Coinbase) layers on top.

I was paranoid about there being some flaw in my Trezor, so I loaded a small amount of money onto my first Trezor, then using my passphrase restored the same amount on my second Trezor. But I was still paranoid that that might be because I used the same computer (my laptop) for both Trezors, so I bought a third Trezor and restored the balance on my work computer.
But now I'm paranoid that all three Trezors were used in the same city, so I might buy a fourth Trezor to test when I fly home to visit my parents.

Is this necessarily true though? I'd think there are two opposing economic forces: 
1. the incentive to make your blocks propagate faster that your block is entered into the chain instead of that from a competing miner.
2. the incentive to make your blocks propagate slowly so that you can mine upon them first.
Wouldn't these two forces balance one another out?

**How do you see the Bitcoin industry evolving in the next 5-10 years and where does General Mining fit into your vision of the future?**
Marco Streng: It is hard to forecast what is going to happen in the next five days in crypto-land. In 5-10 years, Bitcoin, or one of the other cryptocurrencies, will be well established and accepted as a currency. Smart contracts and second layer technologies like lightning will play an important role in some parts of the financial industry. Mining and proof-of-work will probably still be used for some major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but the industry will be more settled and the product cycles will be much longer. Cloud computing is still in the the early stages of its development, and due to its enormous computational power, we will probably be able provide services beyond mining.
**Describe the potential in the Bitcoin space and how you believe people should be looking at the industry?**
Marco Streng: Bitcoin has the potential to become the most important non-government form of money, or even the one and only form of money.  In other words: if Bitcoin succeeds in becoming a good store of value the Bitcoin price can easily go up by a factor of 500. This would just take into account being used only as store-of-value. However, Bitcoin is so much more: with second layer technologies it could facilitate very fast and cheap payments all over the world. Projects like Rootstock would allow Bitcoins to be used in smart contracts and so on. So the potential is enormous, which is why Bitcoiners often encourageone another with the phrase "to-the-moon!”
**Bitcoin is understood as a form of currency for the future — But what other functions does Bitcoin serve and what added value does the industry add to the new economy?**
Marco Streng: Bitcoins are durable, divisible, easy to transfer and Bitcoin is a scarce commodity. Because it is easy to divide, simple and cheap to transfer and almost impossible to counterfeit one could argue that Bitcoin are a better store of value than gold. Global micropayments - with 2nd layer technologies like Lightning, it would be possible to transfer even the smallest amounts from one person to the other in almost no time and at almost no cost. Bitcoin could then be used for micropayments of any sort around the world. Complex contracts can be written and their execution can be guaranteed on a blockchain (called rootstock); Bitcoin would be the currency used for such smartcontracts.
**How do you see the growth of the Bitcoin industry shaping the global economy and impacting politics, social enterprising, e-commerce, etc. ?**
Marco Streng: The world is getting smaller every day. Traveling by airplane became relatively cheap, and technologies like the internet, email and skype allow people from distant places to work together. For example, programmers in San Francisco and Armenia can work together without ever meeting. But, how do they get paid? With the legacy of the financial system, it takes a long time to make wires, and they are expensive too. How is it possible to tip someone who created great content? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will allow all of that. Not only will we be able to easily move around the world and share information, but we will also be able to transfer value between each other quickly and almost no cost. This will allow us to create many new solutions for consumers. Crowdfunding of projects becomes a lot easier, workers that work abroad to earn money for their families can be paid without delay. Smartcontracts will replace expensive third parties and will make businesses between entities easier and safer. But these are just the simple obvious low-hanging fruits. The interesting question is what people will come up with going forward. The technology is young. It's reminiscent of the early days of the internet where no one had youtube, wikipedia and online universities in mind. You could speculate about the future but no one new exactly what shape the tech would take.
**You travel at least 30 weeks per year all around the world to expand the business — Describe what your hustle is like and how you balance the different demands of the job?**
Marco Streng: We have teams all around the world working to innovate and improve our services, so one of my chief goals as we travel is to make sure those teams are empowered to stay innovative and delivering top of industry services for our customers. I also believe strongly in the fact that the success of Cryptocurrency and fintech rely on community support and innovation. That's why all of our leadership regularly attends and speaks at industry conferences to help imagine the future with other leaders in these efforts.

And if you listen to what Bitcoin devs have to say about Ethereum, it's common knowledge that the Ethereum codebase is horrendously buggy, poorly designed, and is gradually becoming more centralized as the on\-chain load grows. 
IMO, there has been no proven use for blockchain outside of a secure, uninflatable currency (Bitcoin).

If ETH is your unit of account, it's irrelevant who holds the rest of the supply stock. Just as I, as a BTC hodler, don't care who owns the rest of the BTC in circulation.

Blockchains don't scale. Recording a transaction across thousands of nodes and miners- some of which may be adversarial to the network- is super fucking expensive. Definitely more expensive than a single, centralized server like Paypal or Visa. It's necessary to have a more lightweight method of making payments, whatever that may be. Even [Hal Finney]( foresaw this 6 years ago.

Only Bitcoin has an extensive network of nodes to enforce that scarcity. If Bitcoin Cash actually had full 32 MB blocks (their current limit), it'd instantly centralize, and then be trivial for the government or another party to inflate the supply. The touted "coin limit" of a cryptocurrency is meaningless unless you can enforce it.

Since being introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, Bitcoin has swiftly evolved to transform the way we imagine global currency in a digital world. Developed by programmers and released as open-source software in 2009, Bitcoin is credited as the first decentralized digital currency, commonly referred to as cryptocurrency, serving as an alternative peer-to-peer payment system.
Deviating from traditional payment methods, transactions are direct between users, without the need for third-party systems, such as physical dollars, coins or credit cards. Additionally, bitcoins can be exchanged for other forms of currency, products or services.
Bitcoin transactions are verified by a network of nodes, then recorded in a publicly distributed ledger known as a “blockchain”, which authenticates bitcoins as monetary units of measurement – or money. Bitcoin mining refers to bitcoins created as a reward in which users verify and record transactions in the blockchain. Users who mine successfully receive fees per transaction in the form of new bitcoins.
In 2015, the total number of merchants accepting bitcoins as currency surpassed 100,000 -- with users being charged less than 2% per transaction, as opposed to the 2-3% processing fee assessed by credit card companies. Even with the impressive strides made, the Bitcoin space has a lot of room to grow.
Much like Gold, bitcoins can be used to store value, minus being a tangible form of currency. Yet, Bitcoin currently has a market cap of around $12.5 billion, while the market cap of gold is $7 trillion. Noticing the potential of the emerging marketplace, one young entrepreneur stepped away from a promising career path to focus on building a bitcoin empire.

Founded in 2013 by 27-year-old Marco Streng, Genesis Mining stands as the largest bitcoin cloud mining company in the world. Boasting more than 300,000 daily customers, the startup has grown to become a global power that employs over 100 full-time staffers from all parts of the world.
Prior to developing the idea for Genesis Mining, Streng was on pace to become a mathematician, dropping out of college amidst his training to pursue his business idea full-time. Strong would eventually team up with two unlikely entrepreneurs and began incubating a concept that would eventually reshape how today’s digital generation makes purchases and accumulates wealth.
Boot-strapping from the start, as the growth of the company began to accelerate, venture capitalists began expressing interest in funding the startup, but the founding team decided against taking outside investment. Instead, the team turned to using profits to fuel growth, which is a very uncommon tactic for hyper-growth startups.
In March, the Genesis team adjusted their strategy by launching Logos Fund, an investment fund catering to top-tier venture capitalists. To date, the fund has raised a reported $100 million in assets.  which went on to raise a reported $100 million in assets under management.  Now, Genesis Mining is respected as one of the few companies within the Bitcoin industry that has created a highly profitable and sustainable business model.
I spoke with Marco Streng about the vision behind his company, battling the skepticisms surrounding the changing industry, and his ambitious plan for reshaping global currency.
**What specific void or opportunity did you discover that inspired the idea to launch Genesis Mining?**
Marco Streng: We found that there was a lack of trustworthy mining companies in the altcoin market. Not enough providers were enabling users to mine the coins they were most interested in. After establishing our brand and a reputation as a reliable and trustworthy mining company, we also entered into the Bitcoin mining space.
**With the space developing so rapidly -- What have been the biggest challenges or surprises you’ve experience while building your business?**
Marco Streng: The cryptocurrency world as a whole moves at an incredible speed. Almost on a daily basis, something in the market changes, and we have to adapt our strategy and business accordingly. If you are not smart and fast in the cryptocurrency world -- you are out.
**Each co-founder comes from a very interesting background — How did the three of you come together and what does each member bring to the table the gives the company an edge in the space?**
Marco Streng: Two of us have a background in mathematics and physics; one already had experience in running a company. Also, everyone brought in good and valuable contacts, such as our entire legal team. The vibe between us is very good, and 99% of the time we quickly reach consensus about how to go forward. We all also share the same goal: making this world a better place by spreading the idea of cryptocurrencies.

Gold beat out silver because of its higher stock to flow, which is because silver tarnishes (reducing its stock).

First, don't memorize your phrase. It makes you a target, cause someone can beat you senseless until you give it up (the $5 wrench attack).
Some people have suggested splitting your 24 word passphrase into two, and hiding them in separate places. That way no one robbery would be able to take your entire seed. Of course, this raises the risk that you lose one of the two halves and thus lose your coins.
There are some metal bitcoin wallets like the Cryptosteel or Billfodl that you can engrave your seed, and then bury it. Or if your house burns down, it'll (hopefully) survive.
Long term, everyone should migrate to multisignature. That means requiring some X of Y private keys to sign a transaction. Then you hide the various private keys in different locations. This is kinda difficult to do now on your own, but companies like Casa and Unchained Capital offers services that help with this. But multisig is definitely the future of Bitcoin security.
If you want to learn the absolute best system in bitcoin security, look up the Glacier Protocol.
Hopefully this helps. Bitcoin security is always evolving. Practice with small amounts before sending large transactions, or use testnet bitcoin. Remember that losing your seed through your own mistake is just as likely (or even more likely) than being robbed.

2. Intermediate (understanding the platform's applications, growth, and potential) :

This is not true at all. Basic game theory dictates that colluding private entities do not last long term because each member has a direct incentive to cheat on the group. Especially in a market where we allow free entry by outside entities.
And re: your opinion on corruption in politics/government: it will **always** exist. As public choice economists like Gordon Tullock and James Buchanan pointed out, providing monopoly power to one institution will inevitably lead to corruption because unscrupulous players will attempt to influence that institution in their favor. That's why you see higher prices, more waste, and less competition in highly-regulated areas of the economy than purely free market ones.
Edit: Also, law enforcement will likely be subdivided into multiple categories, unlike the status quo. Power will be dispersed. You'll have separate companies for:
1. Investigating crimes (private detectives)
2. Defending people and property (private security guards)
3. Prosecuting and defending the accused (private lawyers)
4. Administering courts (private arbitration or courts)
Reputation in this world will matter a **lot** more, because you gain or lose business on the basis of your reputation. Unlike the monopoly status quo of government courts and police.
Realizing this world is scary, yes, and it requires imagination, but we can do this. Don't get locked into status quo bias, that because something is and always has been done some way, that's the way it must always be done. With that attitude, we would still have monarchies, slavery, and every other evil of past eras.

It's also not sufficient to just say that "blocks are full." We should look *at what price* are blocks full? And it turns out fees are still really, really cheap. If you pay 3 or 4 cents, you will get your transaction in, eventually. If you pay like 7-10 cents, you're most likely in the next block. There is no urgency to this issue, so we need to take the time to make sure we scale in the safest manner possible.

Satoshi was human. Quoting his word like gospel 5 years after he left is a bit silly. We have to figure these issues out for ourselves.
And there's no proof people are being "driven away." If this was the case, we'd have much higher fees than what they are today. There's no evidence of the public clamoring to use Bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2016-02-25 18:03:15
You made a major assertion that numerous large players were going to use the Bitcoin blockchain, but in the end opted for another altcoin or their own proprietary blockchain (which is not a blockchain at all because it doesn't use proof of work) because of Bitcoin's limited transaction rates. You have yet to present a single shred of proof to support your assertion. I'm still waiting.

There's virtually no middleman risk in the modern finance. How often do you see banks go belly up and tank their depositors' money? Virtually never.
If your money is being lent out to another person, evaluating the credit worthiness of that person is the job of the bank and its employees. Without real people performing that function, the quality of borrowers drops until the default rate on these loans are sky high.
You can't replace bank employees with dapps, because assessing credit-worthiness is not simply an algorithm.

I've watched a couple of the lectures on Lightning, but it never really answered this question for me. If person B has exactly one bitcoin, and he gives it to D via LN, how does C know that he already spent that bitcoin when B later tries to give it to C?

There are two forms of censorship. One is blocking someone from broadcasting a message. This is impossible due to the nature of the internet. It isn't even possible on reddit, because it takes two seconds to go ahead and start a second subreddit, like the cesspool that is r/btc.
The second form of censorship is via noise. Have lots and lots of sockpuppet accounts that raise FUD. Keep raising the same issues over and over again, even if your proposal has been clearly rejected. Endlessly inject the block size into every issue and thread, be it about malleability, Lightning Network, Seg Wit, whatever. 
So you can whine all you want about Theymos and Core engaging in the first form of censorship, but the XT/Classic crowd are just as guilty of the second form.

Except that the Bitcoin Foundation was horrendously run and had nothing to do with Satoshi- unlike Linus and the Linux Foundation.
Blockstream conspiracy theories are ridiculous. The best devs want to work there because the best want to be around the best. It's that simple. These guys are old school cypherpunks that have been building e-money systems for decades, and have learned from that experience.

This is an inherent feature of blockchains. Blockchains are really, really, really inefficient. Centralized databases are way better. This is an incontrovertible fact. Regardless of what Satoshi thought (and I think he'd agree with me), blockchains work well for transactions that need censorship resistance. That's why, even today, most Bitcoin transactions are for the dark net markets. Raising the blocksize so you can turn it into a "dual use" network would be killing Bitcoin in order to give it a purpose no one will use it for. And trying to accomodate government is inviting a snake into the lair. People like their credit cards and Paypal.

You will have censorship resistant transactions, via Lightning Network. As an added benefit, your transactions will be even more private this way since they're not broadcast to the world. As for settlement, you will indeed be able to settle on the blockchain, but it'll only be once every several thousand LN transactions.

It's impossible to debate an issue without some measure of generalization. Otherwise, you can't characterize anyone's positions- liberals, conservatives, Yankees fans, whatever. But it's clear to me after spending lots of time on that other subreddit, that nothing short of the ouster of Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, and Luke-jr from Bitcoin along with an immediate 2 MB hard fork will make them happy. Don't believe me? Go over there right now to see the reaction. They're primarily upset the hard fork is a year and a half away.

I'm all for being open minded. But there's a false equivalency here between Core vs. BU. One side has the vast majority of users and programmers, and a strong track record of quality development. The other peddles inane conspiracy theories and produces buggy software. And now we have a clear explanation for the support they've gained amongst miners. I cannot simply take the latter group at face value.

The whole concept of buying an ASIC from a manufacturer is dumb. If anyone can earn a profit from running those machines, why would  Bitmain sell it to you? The only way you could outperform them is if you somehow have access to cheaper electricity, which I doubt most buyers do, unless they're hooked up with subsidized electricity somewhere.

Well, I'm considerably less idealogical than when I first met you. You've convinced me to buy cheaper pants. 
I definitely think that, in the short run, taxes are inevitable, but they will slowly, over decades or centuries, be reduced as people use tax evasion strategies to minimize their payments. That includes tax planning, hiding income, and even moving to another jurisdiction. Bitcoin, to me, fits really well into that mold. Also, countries are forced to compete with one another on tax rates.
I'm not sure low taxes would necessarily mean we're invaded. There are lots of countries where taxes are lower than never end up invaded. It's more likely people buy the debt of the country with the world's strongest economy.

The block reward is paid by the entire network. If it didn't exist, miners would not be able to get by without the existing level of fees.
@_date: 2016-02-25 18:57:27
If the block space was in extraordinary demand, transaction fees would be way, way, way higher than they are. The fact that you can get an entry into the global ledger for 3 or 4 cents is a sign that there isn't that much demand yet. Even so, raising the block size cap to 2 MB would hardly change that.
Care to address my point about the private blockchains those companies are running? It directly contradicts your point about desiring space in Bitcoin.

If Bitcoin isn't being filled up by large value settlements, that leaves it open for the small and medium sized transactions you so cherish. So what are you complaining about?
It's also worth noting that no major corporation is using any cryptocurrency. Not even Ethereum. They're using private blockchains, which is an oxymoron, and no different than a traditional database. These companies literally see decentralization and censorship-resistance as a drawback, because their primary objective is to comply with federal regulations. So they never were in the market for Bitcoin to begin with.

That equilibrium would be reflected in the price of entering a transaction into the blockchain. But we're not seeing that.
Now if, someday, many big actors do decide to use the Bitcoin blockchain (and I believe that will indeed happen, but not yet), the price will spike. And then we can make a choice to raise the block size cap when the pressure to do so rises. But right now there's no urgency whatsoever and we should focus our efforts on using the existing space more wisely (SegWit) or to build overlay networks (Lightning).

Strict moderation is not inherently bad. r/AskHistorians is perhaps one of the best subreddits on the entire site precisely because moderators  remove boatloads of threads and comments.

It's like complaining that the plane is full when everybody got their tickets for a buck. Bitcoin transactions are heavily subsidized through the block reward. The reality is that your 4 cent transaction costs way, way more to process. As time goes on, the block reward declines. Unless fees go way, way up, there's no way the network can remain secure. Which is why everyone begging to raise the blocksize is missing the point; it's not about the cost, at all.

Bitcoin is fundamentally a technical program. You only consider this a non-technical question because the technical consensus conclusively disagrees with you (sour grapes?).

Not to derail the conversation, but there's some evidence that it was really Jed McCaleb (the original founder of Mt. Gox that went on to start Ripple and Stellar) was the one who got the Ponzi going. He knew it was going to collapse, so he gave it to Karpeles for nearly free and said "pay me back later." He may have even subsequently hacked Gox after leaving (using the passwords he had access to) and stolen more money. And from there, Karpeles- incompetently- tried to keep the sinking ship afloat, but kept falling farther and farther into debt.

Completely false. That’s a misconception based upon a misunderstanding of economics. Spending bitcoin does not incentivize businesses to accept it. The vast majority of businesses do not want to hold bitcoin because it is too illiquid. That’s why they instantly convert it to dollars. A larger market cap (and hence liquidity) is what incentives businesses to genuinely accept bitcoin. Which requires other people hodl it first.

OP's statement is objectively not true. A currency has value because of hodlers, not spenders. When you spend a currency, you are literally giving it away, and depressing its value. When you buy Bitcoin by exchanging your labor, goods, or a different currency, you are increasing demand for Bitcoin, and hence, its value.

The entire point of Bitcoin is a scarce store of value. The moment you diversify into altcoins, you defeat the purpose of digital scarcity.
Also, LTC, ETH, and XLM are simply retarded. Everything you think you know about them comes from their marketing. They have no non-speculative use whatsoever. XMR might be useful in the case of buying something off a dark net market, but it's not a good store of value.

@_date: 2018-03-11 14:59:58
Because: 
a. Low fees are a temporary state of a blockchain that is not widely used. Once the number of transactions starts rising, fees inevitably will rise. And raising the blocksize in response is simply centralizing the system. 
Also, it's silly to keep switching currencies every few years as soon as one becomes too expensive to transact on. 
b. Lightning Network would be production-ready **much** sooner if real resources by venture-financed companies were placed behind it. There's been probably &lt;15 people working on LN full-time over the last 3 years. 
Bitpay, quite simply put, is a poorly run company that will go bankrupt sooner or later.

You don't contribute to consensus if you have nothing at stake. Otherwise, someone could run a million nodes and control the network.
Running a node to control your bitcoins is important because it reduces the influence of powerful nodes (Coinbase, Bitpay, Trezor, Ledger, Square, etc.) and decentralizes the network.

That's economically backwards thinking, and more in line with Keynesianism, which Bitcoin is in opposition to.
People value currencies with greater liquidity. Hodling increases liquidity. Spending/selling decreases liquidity. It's literally getting rid of the thing you claim to value, which is hypocritical.
Bitcoin **is** an investment. That's how a currency is bootstrapped from 0 to world domination- enough people hodl it.
Your line of thinking was debunked years ago: 
@_date: 2019-01-12 06:12:36

There were probably less than a couple hundred people worldwide that were into bitcoin in 2009. Even by the end of 2010, it was probably only a couple thousand. There were no functioning exchanges at this time, no actual liquid market price until mid-2010, so everyone was either a miner or made p2p deals to buy some. 
So frankly, whenever anyone tells me they were into Bitcoin within its first two years, they are a liar until proven otherwise.

Investing in **companies** gets more difficult, because it's harder for companies to keep topping themselves with better and more popular products.
Currencies get stronger as they get larger, because their network grows larger. In Bitcoin's case, that means more hash power --&gt; more security --&gt; more legitimacy --&gt; more business and developers --&gt; larger market cap. There's a positive feedback loop that isn't true for companies.

We've known that there would only be, at most, 21 million bitcoins for years. None of this is a surprise. Bitcoin's price fluctuates because people have varying, and constantly changing expectations regarding its success.

It doesn't require everyone to pay attention. As long as some speculators recognize this phenomenon (and **everyone knows it's coming**) it will be already priced in.

It's called the Efficient Market Hypothesis. When you know the outcome of a situation in advance, markets will adjust to that eventual outcome. If everyone knew Mayweather would beat Pacquiao before the fight, no one would bet on Pacquiao. Everyone, right now, knows there will be at most 21 millions Bitcoins (regardless of the time it takes to mine them). They factor that number into their calculations, even if not all of those 21 million have materialized today.
@_date: 2015-09-25 16:56:58
No, I don't know the future, but thanks for assuming things I never said. In fact, you're the one who predicted the future here, not me. I merely understand the Efficient Market Hypothesis- events for which the outcome is known well in advance will not shift the market. The block halving is already factored into the current price. If it did indeed guarantee an increase in price, speculators would just buy now and bid up the price in advance. Your argument makes no economic sense.

Could a dynamic block size limit work? For example, if we have a full block (say, the current 1 mb limit), the next block will automatically be 25% larger. And if the next block is still full, the one after that will be 25% larger than that. And so on. If blocks are not full, they will then decrease by 20% each time, bringing them to their prior state. That way the block size will always tend to equilibrate around the current transaction volume.

Oh okay, what wasn't clear is that, when you're talking about deflation, you are considering the passage of time (50 years). But when it come to Bitcoin you're only talking about appreciation (100x).

This is a really interesting, insightful point. I'm not sure if I agree or disagree with you. I'll have to think it over. 
Perhaps, in the future, Bitcoin will fork: one version of the currency of the currency retains the 21 million limit; the other version builds in a permanent inflationary rate. Bitcoin hodlers are automatically hedged  during this fork, as they will retain equal numbers of both coins at the time of the fork. 
And then we will see the outcome of that experiment. Which will survive, and which will die?

I wouldn't say that. I just think he has a profound misunderstanding that there is a tradeoff between on\-chain scaling and decentralization. He refuses to acknowledge that, by putting more and more transactions on\-chain, it will rapidly become prohibitively expensive to run a node. Moreover, the latency in block propagation increases, which incentivizes miners to start merging into larger groups so that they can propagate a block internally before they send it out to the rest of the network. And this isn't even getting into the inherent centralizing effects of hard forks, such as how it breaks the promise made to people running old node software.
No matter which way you cut it, raising the block size exacerbates every potential attack vector against Bitcoin.

I guess it's kinda like paying a fixed salary vs. a base salary + additional incentives (like tips for a waiter). The block is a base salary for winning the block race. Fees are the miners' bonus.

Because ICOs and premines mean handing millions of dollars to a bunch of devs, upfront, without any proven product. It's a perfect avenue for scams- hype a project as the "next Bitcoin," ICO, make millions, then slowly fade out.
Satoshi and everyone else involved in Bitcoin in the early days had to fairly mine or buy the bitcoin themselves. There was a real opportunity cost and they bore real risk to obtain those bitcoins. The fact that they gambled well and the price went up subsequently is a testament to their skill, not that they were scammers.

The more I think about it, the better BitMarkets' approach seems. Reputation-based systems are inherently subject to being gamed. You can see this today with [manipulated Amazon product reviews]( And who knows if you can trust any third-party arbitrator? Pseudoanonymity and reputation just don't seem to go hand in hand. On the contrary, if you force both parties to escrow 2 or more times the actual cost of the transaction, and only return the surplus funds if the transaction proceeds smoothly, that provides a very strong incentive to avoid shenanigans by either party.

They're not saying a central committee should plan the Bitcoin economy and manage interest rates- merely that perhaps the supply should continually expand algorithmically.

There's a constant tug of war between decentralization and centralization. Centralization is probably more efficient, but subject to regulation, which undermines that efficiency. Decentralization introduces massive technological redundancies, but the gain in freedom allows massive efficiency gains in areas with high levels of regulation (banking) or outright prohibition (drugs). I believe that, in the long run, regulation won't be eliminated, but it'll be minimized to the point at which its costs are in equilibrium with that of decentralized protocols.

Adding a mandatory deposit on the part of the buyer and seller is a really good idea to incentivize both parties to be honest! May I also add that the deposit should be greater than the cost of the item?

a. Money has strong network effects, and in the long run the largest currency tends to win out over the smaller ones.
b. Hashing power is scarce, and every new altcoin steals security from other blockchains.
c. 99% of altcoins are built upon touting either useless or outright fake features (DASH is a good example here).
d. Many of them are premined/instamined and then dumped onto gullible noobs who believe the lies of these founders.
e. Sidechains will make **all** altcoins 100% useless because you can obtain the same feature set without speculating on a new currency.
f. Many of the altcoins are not genuinely decentralized, but just use the "blockchain" buzzword to sell their project (i.e. Ripple).

As I've said below, there is a huge difference between cooperating with regulators and authorities when they come knocking on your door with rules and subpoenas, versus **proactively** creating an organization that helps law enforcement conduct their investigations. Let the police do their job on their own; that's what they're paid for. We shouldn't be cozying up to Uncle Sam any more than we have to.

The strength of Bitcoin is in its decentralization, which allows it to be immutable and permissionless. The federal government cannot subpoena Bitcoin. But since private blockchains are maintained by centralized entities, they are subject to present regulatory constraints. This leaves them with nothing more than a traditional database. "Blockchain" has become a buzzword for businesses that want to appear like they're innovating, but without truly changing anything about how they operate.

I respectfully disagree. Can governments prevent you from sending blacklisted coins? No. But by marking them as illicit, those coins will be seen as inherently "inferior" to unmarked coins.

First of all, avoiding blacklists is not the only reason to implement fungibility. Another huge reason is privacy.
But you're wrong with respect to tainted coins. If you try to pass those coins on to a merchant, he or she may refuse them because:
1. Won't be able to pay his taxes with them
2. His employees, suppliers, landlord, etc might refuse tainted coins
3. The government might see he possesses tainted coins and launch investigations 
So that merchant will find it much, much easier just to deny the transaction. 
Your entire argument rests on the assumption that the black market will continue to grow, and illicit coins will begin to vastly outnumber legal ones. I see no hard evidence this will be true, or even that it will produce the outcome you're expecting.
The reason why there is no discount to DNMs, yet, is that blacklisting has yet to come into effect. Many of the early bitcoins mined are still anonymous. But as time goes on, and more people onboard through regulated entities like Coinbase and Circle, the number of coins that **don't** have a history attached to them will shrink. Someday, maybe 50 years from now, every satoshi will have a clear, traceable history. That's why we need fungibility implemented into the core protocol **now**, before it's too late.

You're assuming this pump will follow old patterns. For all anyone knows, we could see a decoupling and Bitcoin soars while altcoiners drop their bags to get back into BTC.

It's impossible to know the precise blocksize at which Bitcoin becomes dangerously centralized. The reasons why we shouldn't do so is because hard forking to increase the blocksize sets the precedent for repeated future hard forks. Every time you hard fork, consensus has to be rebuilt from scratch. The system will become increasingly political.
It's, quite simply, a very bad approach.

If your investment thesis is correct, then no, hodlers do not lose money.

Again, you don't know this. You do not know if the Bitcoin price is going to go down another 50%, or quadruple. YOU DO NO KNOW.
The only thing a smarter investor can do is develop an intelligent, coherent investment hypothesis, buy assets accordingly, and then wait until their theory is proven true or false. Trading is for losers.

Those small businesses that are barely scraping by are **precisely** the right fit for BTC- they can't afford the fees major credit card companies foist onto them.

Power, some would argue, is the ability to control others. Freedom is the exact opposite of that.

I think a lot of those places don't take cards because of the fees they charge. Which isn't an issue with BTC.

A lot of people haven't even *heard* of bitcoin yet. I told my gf about them, and she said they "sounded silly."

Yeah, I've never understood why merchants aren't offering Bitcoin discounts, considering many expect it to keep going up and up.

Never underestimate the greed of Wall Street. Once the first major hedge fund takes a position and starts making real $$$, the rest of the sheep will follow.

A vast majority of dollars (around 98%, I believe) are digital as well.

Lightning Network does enhance privacy, but not via mixing. It enhances privacy because only connected parties are known to each other, at least until final settlement (which will be further obfuscated through onion routing). Furthermore, because many transactions can be made both ways before settling onto the blockchain, any monitoring parties can only know that final settlement amount and not how much funds were genuinely transacted across each channel.

Dude, .1 BTC will be worth a helluva lot in 10 years. Save, keep buying, and you'll be ahead of 99% of humanity.

Yeah! Once people start getting paid in BTC, then we won't need to worry about all the bullshit of exchanging fiat for BTC. The number of adopters will skyrocket.

At least he's not on the short buss.

Is this not a huge impediment to Bitcoin's mass adoption? If transactions keep failing because no miner will verify against double-spending?

Will this be a regular thing? I'm out of town for the holidays, but would love to partake after the New Year.

Perhaps a more sympathetic judge or jury pool? The same reason why most patent litigation occurs in one small East Texas district.
