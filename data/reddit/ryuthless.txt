How would this help us know who has hardware and who doesn't? 
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:02:01
Thanks! I didn't even notice lol

I use coinbase for my Cloud Hashing wallet. Works fine for me.

I lost BTC as well when BTCt.co got shut down/moved. I bought a few full shares of Asicminer before they offered partial shares. By the time freidcat moved them to havelock, i lost 7 BTC from the shares falling in price. There were also neo shares on there at one point too. Look at how that turned out.

Thanks!

idk. cloud mining company giving away btc- you have to sign up and call them but they do give you free btc. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:33:43
50 free Gh/s - it pays out daily. like i said, not much but still cool.
I shared it with my friends who don't have any and they all got some too. 
edit- great way to get friends into BTC who don't want to buy..

she mentions the lottery at 00:57.. but yea I get what you're saying. Very difficult to explain especially when discussing with btc virgins. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:14:44
LOL right.... fkn hot
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:07:09
Mike from Coinfire made a post on reddit about the hack that was recently deleted- I have screenshots and the link 
edit: Added Screenshots from the CF twitter

Thank ya! 
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:43:11
Yea you can if you want to. - it varies from day to day but i get around 0.00057 BTC ($0.15)
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:13:31
Idk it was free 
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:46:18
Not sure. Leave a message on the YT channel 
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:49:41
It's definitely not perfect but it's a start. we need more great vid explanations like this in this sub. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:34:39
yup. but free btc is still pretty cool. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:16:43
Thanks for the tip. I knew there had to be a better way. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:37:23
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:40:57
haha wow... No one wants to fight. I just have no idea what you're talking about. I feel you will see you're mistaken once you actually visit the site. You must be thinking of another website.... 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:27:45
Huh? I didn't see anywhere asking for phone number? 
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:42:21
Hell yea same! I'm receiving 10¢ a day from them. They also answer any questions you have about bitcoin and setting up a wallet. 
r/bitcoin is full of haters nowadays. I don't even like visiting this sub anymore. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:30:16
I did go through the site. It asked for email and social media but no phone. Maybe I missed it. 
Edit: just checked the site again. Does not mention phone number. Not sure what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:04:22
LOL! So you delete all your comments showing how wrong you were? Typical bitcoiner. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:26:14
yea. I thought so too. Good domain name as well. I'll be watching this site closely to see what else they do. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:36:22
Uhh. This site is new as far as I know. Yes, I got my free bitcoins without a phone call, they also have an option to donate it. PLEASE TRY THE SITE BEFORE COMMENTING AGAIN!  I don't think you're making it up. Screen shot it to prove me wrong then. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:52:16
Howdy - Pass dem bits! Thank ya kind sir. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:37:58
lol.... you're like a broken record. I got my free bitcoins without a phone call. Did you even go through the site? If so, screen shot the part where you have to call. Maybe they updated since your visit. I have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:18:01
No, I got my free bitcoin in a couple minutes. They are actually paying out a decent amount. It seems very similar to a faucet but done differently. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:30:59
Did you even go through the site before posting?!
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:29:16
 This was the purpose of the post. thank you for your honest opinon. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:00:11
I'm afraid by the time I actually get my unit, mining will be so difficult that it will take me a year or more to start turning a profit.

@_date: 2013-05-17 05:27:25
Yes, I understand this. I was wondering the most efficient and secure way of doing transactions in person though. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:26:49
What is the best way to sell locally? Through a wallet app, exchange, or the LocalBitcoins site?  I have been holding my BtC for a while now so I have little experience moving them around. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:40:15
Awesome! Thank you so much for your quick response.. I'm a little confused on how to purchase form MTGox. After I make an account can I use my bank account to buy BTC? How long does verification/transactions usually take. Sorry if these are stupid questions, I can't access the site while at work. The security system kicks me offline every 10 min or so. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:52:09
40 seconds now
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:46:17
Do you think it would be wise to put more money in?  I have some extra cash to play with but didn't want to go all in. I wanted some new astrophotography equipment but wouldn't mind putting it into BTC :)
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:18:30
Time to buy or last chance to sell in the 90's?
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:23:47
I'm sure we will see a few more dips. Just my guess based on the current downward trend 
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:28:19
Can you post a link to the chart you are using? Thanks!
@_date: 2013-07-09 20:45:47
Stuck at work tonight but I'll try my best to make it to atleast one of these this month! 
@_date: 2013-04-27 05:45:05
Pay in Bitcoin!....
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:20:43
The company would not last long term. Why would they cash in on one quick scam when they have the ability to create a business?
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:57:45
Thanks! I'll give this a shot when I get off work. Do I need an account with BOA in order to deposit to Bitfloor or do most large banks allow this? 
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:10:50
to me the risk is worth it. I can lose the money and still be fine. I would rather lose 1200 than and be kicking myself in the ass later for not going through with it. It's just money.. right?
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:29:40
I'm a little confused here.... so bitinstant is a site that allows me to transfer cash into an account like MTGox that will then let me buy bitcoins from other sites? I cant buy bitcoins through them? Sorry for all of my newb questions. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:07:13
How do you know they won't deliver? 
@_date: 2013-04-27 06:29:09
I'm there! Exhange BTC for buddah?!

Hell yea that's a great idea. Thank ya sir!
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:48:25
Hopefully soon I will have BTC to share! 
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:43:06
Thanks, that's great to hear! I read about these recent issues so I'm really glad to know they're getting everything back up. The low rates and easy bank transactions is what caught my attention. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:46:36

so why not stay in line? If I'm so far back in line I can get a refund when the first reviews start coming out.
@_date: 2013-04-27 06:49:51
uh. You could be mining or bought BTC when it was cheaper.
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:08:24
Can you explain why you think they won't deliver? links etc..

Thanks for the honest response. I understand this is a gamble and not an investment so I wouldn't put in any money I couldn't lose. I'm getting really excited to see what the future holds for BTC.
