The process is pretty easy:
* First, send 0.1 bitcoin to 1ADYU9hnVPJAng2RVjLEvK9JWUdiFSPKx. A small amount, just to prove how gullible you are.
* Second, send a PM to the Bitcointip bot, subject = "Withdrawel"
* Third, watch as the price goes all the way to the moon.
Buy a yacht or start a charity. You're welcome.

Don't do this. It's true that Google Voice SMS verification is working on Coinbase, but it's an anomoly. Most 2-step SMS codes don't. Just try to use Google Voice with a bigger company like Yahoo or Twitter. It won't work. Google voice is unreliable for SMS verification - for SMS in general. Read their FAQ and TOS.  While Coinbase might work today, who knows about the future. As the company grows you may find yourself locked out of your account.

Finally a "charity" website hosted on a free service &amp; created by a high-schooler with an immature Reddit history, full of bad grammar and poor coding. No guarantee that the coins will go anywhere other than your own wallet. Add a dash of juvenile humor. Who could resist?
Here's a little something to get you started.

Well, today it looks like it's the way downward.
 But who knows what the morrow will bring? The price swings up and down with such volatility I wouldn't be surprised if it started moving backward and forward as well.

Perhaps implementing previews to text might prove beneficial?

It does work with Authy,  which is a 2-step authenticator similar to Google.

The tip may be fake, but the argument is solid. I was trying to offer you some advice, kiddo. If you want to start a charity, you may want to work on your customer service skills. Here's another, for lessons.

First you'll want to hire somebody to write your letters and releases, perhaps a marketing manager or an English major. Here's a little something to get you started. Spend it on grammar lessons.

Please provide a list of those bitcoiners who are easily scammed. For my own research, of course.

As much as I want to buy this story from an unknown author, without foreknowledge of the plot or the even a brief summary of what to expect, my sensibilities won't allow me. That cloying typo on the very last line of your poem does not inspire much confidence.

I don't think they want me there.
