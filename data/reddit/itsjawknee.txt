This seems right based on their FAQs: 
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:09:52
I have no idea what security measures they take... Vault services aren't even mentioned in their user agreement - we have to rely on web copy and the limitation of liability in the user agreement.  That inspires even less confidence.

Agree though not on the fee front. Circle and Xapo have figured this out and their fees are minimal. The CB blog post just seems counterintuitive...
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:55:56
Surprising that this is something blogworthy. It only just highlights that the cold stored coins - 97% of held coins - are up for grabs. Makes me also wonder why they haven't been able to obtain insurance for their vault. My suspicion is that their security isn't up to snuff in the eyes of their underwriters... Either way, not storing coins in their vault. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:49:40

I'm still hoping that Lawsky's first draft was a negotiation tactic and not an accurate depiction of his office's expectations about what the regs ultimately will / should look like.  Not a good outcome for bitcoin if NY gets blacklisted by the big guys like Circle, Coinbase, Xapo, etc...
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:25:29
Interesting. Though then I would want to know what security they use for the vaults. Otherwise why not just keep all my coins in a hot wallet if actually 100% fully insured?

I agree I was oversimplifying and that there are numerous factors to be considered. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:26:54
Currently? Simple - nobody pays with it in the market I'm in (US). The cost of implementing doesn't make sense. 
About me: bullish on Bitcoin and work in the ecosystem with the largest companies. My original comment was to point out that the source of the statement isn't compelling (even though I can't say I disagree with it).

Ok. Someone please tell the vote master to call for a vote. I can't seem to find 'em. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:44:13
Sure. I think node incentives might be one thing we should consider at some point. 
I'm interested to see what they say as well. I also haven't seen or heard of any implementation of a side chain by blockstream (though the side chains operated by exchanges and hosted wallet providers certainly do help take strain off of the network). So it's hard for me to defer to sidechains as an end all be all. 
I'm also concerned about on-chain transactions coming out of the developing world where services like Abra and LocalBitcoins find compelling use cases for the unbanked. I just want the network to be ready and am open to novel solutions.

@_date: 2015-05-31 14:47:21
Economic incentives are great. Though it's not a good outcome for zero fee / low value transactions to go unconfirmed for long periods of time / indefinitely. That would undermine the whole point of the system. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 22:49:36

@_date: 2015-05-21 00:15:42
It would be more compelling coming from a strategist at a payments company. 
Btw - Gavin believing this is a good thing. I want him focused on scaling the protocol for when adoption does reach an inflection point. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:52:19
Indeed. Pay for lowest risk (no centralized authority / no fractional banking) then a continuum of paying for a service up to earning interest based on risk appetite.

That would make sense. Build in an ROI for nodes that reflects cost + some small % profit

@_date: 2015-05-21 01:14:14
Troll. But I'll indulge. 
Looks like you just answered your earlier question about business strategy for not accepting BTC...? Which I already answered - because there's no reason for consumers in my market to pay with BTC. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:12:41
I disagree. Many operators will be incentivized to run their own nodes (miners, wallet providers, individuals that want the security for their own funds, etc.) and this alone will maintain the network. I would favor a system to help incentivize individuals to maintain their nodes as well (though admittedly I don't know what that would look like). 
Curious - the current network needs to scale dramatically if it will ever support reasonable expectations of future volume (with or without side chains). What would your solution be for this without increasing the block size?
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:38:38
I like the idea of an emergency plan. My concern as a business operator is that my efforts for user adoption might be hampered by bottlenecks in the network, which could be really bad. I also think we will see large increases in adoption from the developing world soon so we need to be ready.

Changetip's integrations, though laudable, are nightmares from a user experience perspective. I'm not convinced the soundcloud announcement is even newsworthy. Let's see some actual adoption and tipping numbers. So far change tip has not been impressive on metrics either. Would be great for them to succeed - and I'm waiting patiently. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:13:35
If the benefit is $0 then any cost outweighs. I'm also pro BTC. It's a far harder sell for others. 
I should mention that I have a side business (a brick and mortar) and we are set up to accept Bitcoin and have never once had a customer ask to pay in Bitcoin. And this is SF. I recognize this is anecdotal but does serve to highlight the point I'm making. Elsewhere I'm sure it makes sense (Philippines, Argentina, parts of Africa, etc.). 
@_date: 2015-05-21 01:46:03
There was a thread about this that I'm having trouble locating on mobile. Coinbase, Xapo, Andreas(?) and others were among the supporters (and the thread linked to the expressions of support - tweets, blog posts, etc). I'll link here if I find it.

Gavin is a technologist, not a business strategist, so I don't attach a lot of weight to this. That said, on matters of bitcoin core I defer to him 100%.
@_date: 2015-05-01 19:59:49
Seriously. Boos from the sidelines are the cost of "doing" though.  It's a small price to pay and REALLY cool launching stuff notwithstanding.

I also believe fractional reserve w/ bitcoin is inevitable. circle and coinbase simply aren't doing it yet - likely for the exact reasons you cite

But otherwise the node is a cost without a reward? I haven't ever hosted one so just trying to understand. 
If so, how do we ensure there are enough nodes in the future? Perhaps miners should share rewards to cover cost of the node network?

Theory and practice are vastly different. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 16:26:55
Perhaps though I find this to be the easiest way to hook people who have no idea what Bitcoin is. If I say anything using the standard buzzwords - "protocol", "decentralized", "ledger" etc. - eyes glaze over and nobody cares. Have to start with answering the why (as in "why should I care") before you can address the "how does it work."
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:05:42
Can someone ELI5 what the benefit (incentive to the individual) of running a node is (regardless of max block size)?
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:16:58
Which becomes more of a factor when the price goes up. It would be a pain in the ass for some folks either way. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:30:57
If you're new and not a technical person just use a cold storage solution if you're just holding for long term. Coinbase and Xapo both have very user friendly versions of these. I'll get downvoted for this because they are centralized services - certainly a trade off. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:03:45
Agree completely that the low value transactions are best dealt with off chain or on side chains. Especially for non-currency applications like using colored coins for ownership interests of a physical asset, tipping, time stamping, etc. We still need quite a bit of off / side chain infrastructure to be built out for those use cases, however. Also, though not sure what the potential volume would be on a long term basis, but some will always want to go on-chain to truly "be their own bank" so we need to account for some volume coming from there (both on the consumer and merchant side). 
@_date: 2015-05-21 01:24:33
Fortunately he's getting support from the companies responsible for the bulk of on and off-chain volume. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:16:45
Betting on altruism seems risky. A miner-like incentive would be better.  Perhaps the miner network pays the node network an amount determined by average cost per node. The node fees could be set according to a formula based on size of blockchain relative to cost of electricity to run the node. Amounts could be paid out to nodes every 100 blocks or so (definitely not every block). 
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:23:29
For promise of a global currency or to solve an incredibly cool / complicated engineering problem?
I'll say this - if in 5-10 years his statement is untrue then something went horribly wrong. It's a safe thing to say. My point is more that Gavin isn't the best source for adoption / economic metrics given that he is a brilliant engineer NOT a business person. I don't know that he'd dispute what I'm saying (Gavin feel free). 
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:42:22
What's your rationale?
@_date: 2015-05-01 14:45:46
All will be forgiven and forgotten after launch. 
Maybe not for you though. I've been reading your comments and noted your general bias towards disparaging what Barry and his team are doing. Not sure what your interest is but I think it's fair to say that the BIT could do no right in your eyes. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:24:12
This is correct. Most of the other comments in this thread are speculative (borderline conspiracy theory for some). Obtaining an MTL is how they would have sought approval from New York. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:51:43
Xapo announced at some point that it has top rated insurers covering it's vault storage insurance in addition to its captive insurance. Unclear what type of coverage elliptic, circle or Coinbase have -- anyone know if they've ever disclosed insurers / coverage amounts? 
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:36:48
a lien can be placed on an individual's holdings just as easily if held by the individual or a third party -- multi-jurisdictional multi-sig could solve this potentially.

The problem with this is adoption. ChangeTip will do better with in-app tip button integrations where Bitcoin isn't even mentioned. Could be a "tip" or even more simply a "money" button. This is better from a product perspective. You also don't need a full keyboard to send a tip. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:54:42
I can't get it to work within the Facebook environment using the standard changetip formula. Is this only working through the changetip homepage? 
@_date: 2015-01-21 08:13:12
Some will want interest for stored coins though. I don't think the answer is outright fractional reserve ban but more clarity for the type of service one is signing up for. For instance, proof of reserve for coins that are being stored for a price then a sliding risk scale of expected interest rate and anticipated risk of investment. This would be wayyy ahead of the current system but also allow for some to earn interest in deposits (or even invest, etc). 
TL;DR: pay for 1:1 storage and be made aware of sliding risk scale for btc deposits that earn interest as a middle ground. 
Pretty sure I get downvoted for this...
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:22:03
Gotcha. Thanks for the prompt replies and congrats on the achievement!
@_date: 2015-05-11 16:56:07
Technical compliance and practical likelihood of enforcement are two separate concepts. Merchants can't enable money laundering and, at certain transaction thresholds, would need to perform KYC. Not a great idea to make pronouncements about the need to comply either way. Coinbase got flayed for their "Regulated Exchange" PR, for example. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:37:54
Great idea! I hope the folks you contact don't hide behind confidentiality restrictions...

Use circle or coinbase to start. Some of the favorites from r/Bitcoin lack functionality or are hard to use for someone new. Once you move up the learning curve a bit you can try some of the more secure but harder to use ones (armory, mycelium, etc.). 
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:12:22
Wait until they put a gun to your head. In-person entails its own risks as well. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 06:27:22
They aren't good enough blockchain devs to make their own and they wouldn't want another provider knowing about their embarrassingly low tipping volume. It'll be a while before they have this, I'd imagine. Agree it would be a great feature for them / the ecosystem. 
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:48:52
KYC may apply regardless of whether a currency exchange occurs. Be careful. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 16:28:02
Sure - but if we're going for elevator pitch you are already getting too technical in even mentioning satoshi or white paper. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 06:09:52
Fine. But I also think full nodes should receive a direct incentive as a function of the value to the network and cost of operation.

Some services pay miner fees on behalf of their users and batch to cut cost. You can also send a zero fee transaction. 
Instant because once broadcast the transaction will show up in any block explorer. 
This is why Bitcoin, as an industry, is terrible at marketing. Too bogged down in technical details that the end goal average user won't care about and won't even be aware of. 
All that said, I also think a more accurate way could be to use the absolute superlative to compare. "Fastest and cheapest method of sending money anywhere in the world." I don't like that as much though - less punchy and seemingly defensive. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 06:33:57

@_date: 2015-07-09 19:58:30
How would a normal person access the content and what would they see? Some amount of centralization is good for purposes of productizing and ensuring smooth access to content. I'm not technical enough to understand if this would be a problem but I do know that trying to surf through GIFs / videos in BitTorrent format would not work for the average reddit user. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 09:46:25
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:40:18
If each user is paying I wonder if the content ends up being as good though. I would bet there'd be far fewer users. Splitting revenues associated with good content between the creators and the service might be a good option. Thoughts?

Totally get your point - the reason why it's complicated is that "at fault" as you mention has many shades. Most execs try to cover their asses as much as possible (understandably) so it really comes down to their peace of mind re value storage options. We have the US legal system to thank for making "at fault" an extremely complicated concept, btw ;)  
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:57:38
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. A big piece of my job is to grow adoption of Bitcoin and I can confirm that starting the description with "it's a set of protocols" would result in immediately losing the audience. 
Focus on how the product USING Bitcoin is beneficial to the potential user. Nobody ultimately cares about the "why" they just want something that's better than what they had before (if even they're looking / can be convinced to switch). Frankly I've found that even mentioning Bitcoin makes things too complicated. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:07:47
I understand that. But the CEO and COO don't want to be responsible is the point. This is what I've observed directly - not theoretically. Personally, I use multisig with my and my wife's coins. It works great but I'm also willing to be responsible if something happens because it's my (our) money. It's different for a company / investment fund because you're responsible for other people's money and, especially as a CEO or COO, you have fiduciary duties and other legal obligations. The fear for the CEO or COO is that if ANYTHING happens - doesn't matter what, could be a freak accident - they're getting sued and they are the defendant of last resort because they were responsible. In the case of a custodian who specializes in security they can feel better that they've checked a box and outsourced security to a professional. Also, the custodian is there to sue in the worst case scenario situation. We can peel back further layers of this like D&amp;O insurance (or the lack thereof for anyone dealing with bitcoin) but that's beside the point because I see this on a daily basis when meeting with folks in the space.
All that being said, the early adopter bitcoin millionaire that mined their coins is a great use case for multi-sig!  They get it, understand how to protect themselves, and are also likely more interested in managing their own wealth personally than outsourcing. Multi-sig is a great use case for that.
@_date: 2015-04-20 04:22:22
All of the functionality you mention is already available. Also the hardware wallet would be a very big bet on Bitcoin adoption - putting a wallet on a phone does not guarantee adoption (otherwise we'd be further along). I think their play is more sophisticated than hardware wallets and was probably worth an enormous valuation because what they're doing stands to proliferate blockchain technology (regardless of whether consumers know they're using it).

You can always count on a dick response like this in r/Bitcoin. Dude asked a genuine question (I don't know how best to respond otherwise I would)! Nobody will ever accuse r/Bitcoin of catalyzing mass adoption.  
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:37:48
it doesn't work in practice since the custodian is supposed to be the one responsible for securing the value. having an individual be responsible for a private key undercuts the reason why people hire custodians.
works very well for the tech savvy HNWIs that understand bitcoin though!
@_date: 2015-09-30 19:47:07
I agree with your theory but in practice Bitcoin doesn't have a history to support such a switch. It's 1) volatile, 2) subject to price manipulation and 3) difficult for a layperson to use and secure. I don't think global economic catastrophe, in the near term anyway, is the user adoption strategy on which to hang our hats.

Nope. Nobody cares what "Bitcoin" is and references to it and blockchain will be reserved for the geeks like us. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:01:09
It makes sense. It's a legit way for money managers, funds, etc. to invest in Bitcoin. That's why there's a premium (though 100% seems VERY high). 
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:40:52
Operational accounts are easy. An account used for settling Bitcoin trades is another story.

Can't really use multi sig for other people's assets. Need a custodian for it to work at the institutional level. This is why BNY Mellon exists instead of splitting up cash amongst multiple banks, for example.

The problem is really market cap / volatility. B2B transactions tend to be huge and involve a local fiat currency so using the "rail" causes problems at the on/off ramps.

I would bet it was written by a lawyer who is using these types of risk factors for numerous financial services clients.

This is such an over-hyped article. The letter was basically a vanilla risk factor that you SHOULD include if you're a public company in a letter to investors.

The idea that "he" isn't still involved in Bitcoin is ridiculous. There isn't an all knowing nameless God just a tactful decision made by the early scientists in the project. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:36:34
Open source for a project like this would also be good given its implications. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:32:28
Thanks for taking the time to post those. 
The "who are they" links you posted only speak to one of their investors (and some of their other investments). I can't seem to find anything about the actual team and whether I think they can pull off what they're claiming. 
Also, I'd like more technical details on the solution and what its vulnerabilities are. One of the best ways to steal coins would be via a device attached to the hardware storing the coins which is why I'm interested to learn more. Reddit posts don't really give me any comfort.

What do you mean? I put Bitcoin in my Xapo wallet and the card works. No pre-loading other than simply having BTC in the wallet. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:19:38
If your card is an EU card there isn't a fee. The 3% fee only applies to fx transactions (meaning that there's a currency conversion). 
@_date: 2015-04-24 22:41:13
I think the APs will come. That said the holding period would remain the same unless Barry finds a different exemption under U.S. securities laws. Perhaps there will always be a spread since you're basically buying an option contract and the writer of the option (and the market) assumes a rise in the price of BTC.

This is an odd move for a presidential candidate since the global Bitcoin community isn't very big. Also, Bitcoin has a taint to it to a layman that would seem politically risky. At best, being outspoken about Bitcoin would be neutral for a politician (I'd think). I wonder what his angle is...
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:46:27
sweet prank, Farva...
@_date: 2015-04-22 07:48:02
You either misunderstood the instructions or are making this up. The card pulls from your BTC balance in your wallet automatically. No pre loading except to have BTC in the wallet. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:23:09
Even if you assume the worst of intentions behind the use of the term "user" isn't the integration still a good thing for Bitcoin?

@_date: 2015-04-23 10:39:51
It's not misleading. It's just another figure and represents the total number of potential users for the program (assuming flat growth). It's the same as defining the market size in a pitch deck - though I would argue that market size figures are far more misleading because they tend to rope in fairly lofty assumptions about growth potential. Your nit picking on a distinction and totally missing the point.

Taringa + Bitcoin is an epic win for Bitcoin, content creators, social media, etc. etc. and will garner media attention for decades up and down the Americas (and perhaps the world). The commenters in your thread recognize that, the commenters in the original post about the announcement recognize that and everyone else with half a brain recognizes that. The only ones that don't are the PRAW bots you made (if you're even that clever) upvoting your mindless post. 
Btw "users" can be broadly construed. Their use of the term wasn't deceiving at all. So Im wondering what did Xapo do to you personally to piss you off enough to have you post a very deceiving neg in response to such a monumental achievement?
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:47:36
It's true - what's actually happening in Bitcoin is so far removed from what goes on in this sub. Your post was heartfelt (and I sympathize because getting slammed in here by anonymous semi sociopaths affects anyone) but I think you have better things to do with your time (I mean that constructively, not disparagingly) and I'm 100% sure r/Bitcoin has zero impact on the success of your hackathon. 
Time to move on. There are great industry group slack channels, google groups, etc. (some of which I believe you're in) that are better channels for real discussions and announcements.

Yes. I think any payments company, whether Bitcoin based or otherwise, needs to have good security measures in place to combat these types of attacks. 
I'm hoping to see more Launchkey integrations in payment provider platforms for this reason.

You're a purist, which I totally respect. Some tech isn't meant for the average consumer though. Look at what the Internet is today (apps) vs. what it started as. To be successful, Bitcoin will need to shed the naming conventions of "seeds", "private keys" and even "bitcoin". It will need to just be faster, cheaper and easier to use (and this includes security). 
There will always be a place for the purist though. Understanding the engine underneath it all will always be valuable and will help you secure your own wealth cheaply. 
Edit - grammar. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:27:26
This is why the average consumer doesn't want to / probably shouldn't hold their private keys. If you're posting here then I assume you are more sophisticated than even the average consumer. Companies like Coinbase, Circle and Xapo are really geared towards protecting consumers from themselves. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:00:16
haha - "donate"
@_date: 2015-03-26 01:11:06
This is cool but to make it work for the average consumer you need to ditch references to 'multi-sig' and especially blockchain addresses.  None of that means anything to the average consumer and it never will.  Keep it simple and focus on what it does instead of why it does.

Easiest way to get your cold storage solution hacked is to use someone else's code - this is how a hacker could get around an air gap. I'm sure you're legit but I'll have a lot of trouble trusting an Internet stranger's code on something like offline transaction signing.

*What gives it the potential title of “killer app” is the fact that Abra is powered by Bitcoin, but the user has no idea that Bitcoin is what is powering it.*
Aside from the fact that saying "killer app" makes me cringe, this is totally spot on.  The notion of consumers holding private keys or transacting in bitcoin is baseless.  Focus on the beauty of it as a payment rail, build on top of it, and enable a truly competitive product!

it was funny to watch some of the other "how do I acquire $[x] worth of bitcoin?" threads changetip the poster well beyond the inquired-for amount.  So far my tip jar is empty though I do agree with the methods folks have been posting for buying large blocks.  Maybe I'll go pose the same question to the receptionist at Boost.vc 
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:21:28
Changetip's flow is also in need of a revamp. I've been trying to tip folks and have heard "I didn't know how to do it" from a number of folks. I bet a lot of refunds can be attributed to the poor new user flow (especially from Facebook). 
The way for this to work is for native integrations and for the user to not necessarily even know it's Bitcoin they are receiving. Consumers are dumb but do like money. Remove the complexity and then tip. Bitcoin still gets to be the payment rail and everybody wins.
