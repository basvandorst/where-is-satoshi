Also used to be a regular. Also unsubscribed and don't check very often. Still a big btc fan but the moderation here is very off putting.

So it can't ever go to zero unless it does ;)
@_date: 2015-12-30 05:09:18
I was mistaken. I previously checked at giftcardzen not giftcardgranny. Giftcardzen is not currently buying amazon cards so I can't check again. Giftcardgranny just aggregates sites and does not actually buy or sell cards. A quick look around at other sites that buy amazon giftcards are offering 65% of value. You could sell on ebay but then there is a 10% commission and paypal fees and some risk of scammers and paypal/ebay are notorious for siding with the buyer. 
I'm sure there is some (or maybe a lot who knows) of fraud of purse.io. But they are US based, if fraud was rampant I would have expected them to be taken down by now. 20-30% is within the range of rates giftcard buying sites offers.

Didn't soylent used to take btc too? Don't see the option on their site anymore.
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:11:41
On that note. I recommend the book "The tipping point"
@_date: 2015-12-30 04:10:23
That is not necessarily true. The buyer may only get a 1% discount but the seller of the card to gift card granny is likely getting much less. When I checked in the past the spread was 15% or more.
Edit: I was mistaken, giftcard granny is just an aggregator they don't buy cards. A quick look at a site that does buy amazon cards offered 65% of it's value (Card Kangaroo)

Yes he's a tool but surely there are some respected people who have their reasons why they don't think it will succeed.

That would be a fantastic feature! I don't have a twitter account but if I could tip from here I'd have no excuse not to tip people on twitter!

@_date: 2014-12-07 03:03:57
How do they profit? I've never heard of that either. Also, even if the ATM doesnt charge a fee, my old bank would charge a fee for being out of netowkr. So I'd pay $2-3 to the ATM and another $1-2 to my bank. My new credit union is awesome though! No out of network fees and any 711 ATM is free to use.

I'm fine with my basis being 0 since what I paid is so small compared to what its worth now. I'm just mainly concerned about getting the long term capital gains rate. Thanks for the help. +$5
@_date: 2014-11-17 11:17:29
This has been debunked. Not fake after all. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:55:14
Yep exactly. Paid something like $5-10 so it really makes no difference compared to $0 when its at $800
@_date: 2014-11-19 01:02:31
Thanks, but I'm trying to find one that offers discounted gift cards. Basically one user gets a gift card they don't want and sell it to the site for less than face value and the site resells it to you for at a discount. For instance I can get an autozone gift card for 20% off from giftcardzen.

@_date: 2014-01-03 22:40:29
I bought my coins a while back with cash in person so I have no record of when I bought them or what I paid. How can I prove I've held them for over a year? Is there a way I can document holding them now so a year from now I can be 100% certain I have proof of holding them for a year?
Do we have to report what our untouched btc are worth or only report something if they are sold/traded etc.
@_date: 2014-11-07 12:39:44
I wonder what would happen if there was an effort to tip a large amount (say $100) to popular users on youtube. I wonder how many would mention it in a video, and how long it would take for talk of these large tips to go viral?
@_date: 2014-12-09 05:21:28
I wonder how that would legally work. If I have the private key to an address and you deposit money to that address, is that not giving ownership to me?
What would this be comparable to? The closest I can think of is a joint bank account.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:41:48
Damn that's a shame! Hopefully they have it figured out soon. A tip that doesn't work is much worse than no tip functionality at all.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:08:21
I may have written down when they were acquired and for what price in my personal docs somewhere but that doesn't seem like it would be valid proof.
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:41:26
Once you scan the code from the card in the funds on that card are no longer cold and no longer as secure. As long as you don't consider the card cold storage once you have scanned the code you've got a great method.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:17:12
Wow! Now that is special.
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:51:54
Do you have a source on the $10k figure? I have never heard of any reporting requirements for holding bitcoin unless you sell it. I may be wrong but I think what you're thinking of is if you have more than $10k in a foreign bank account you need to report it, or something along those lines?
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:43:42
I'll bet 5btc. Same terms: If bitcoin stays between $100 and $500 for over a year, either of us can cancel this by paying the other .25 btc to get out. If btc price touches 100.00 you win and if it touches 500.00 I win. Did you figure out a secure way to escrow the bet yet? Would you like to use bitfnex as the exchange rate?
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:22:24
If you're spending from cold storage with mycelium isn't it no longer cold?
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:02:10
They can definitely both be true! This is true for most consumer tech! People know how to use it enough to get themselves in trouble.

Heres an waesome recipe....ok im going to type very slowly so I dont fuck this up becayse its an amazing recipe of mine, cheap and delicous
Shoyu Chicken (Shoyus is soy sauce ok)
1cup shoyu
couple table spoons of fresh grated gingers
AS much gralic as you fucking want minced (at least 3-4 cloves but I've done way more and its amazing)
1 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup vinegar (you can leave it out no big deal)
3-5lbs boneless skinless chicken thights
1 cup water
Throw all that shit in a pot and simmerf or 1 hour and it will come out super tender and delicous. It drops panties. If you over all that shit up and the chicken is still pokig out ever afer it melts then your pot is a weird as fuck size and you should add more more ingridients in ratio.
Pretty much just follow this shit and make sure the chicken is covered and for the full out and move it around every 15 min and you have an amaxzing cheap assmeal....sever with rice
