More mining power without difficulty adjustment means more blocks are found (every 7.5 min instead of 10min). It will go back to 10min at the next adjustment.

How can it realistically have had its peak? For (when/if) Bitcoin to be a stable currency it would need a deep enough market to not be moved by huge orders. A market cap of 14bln$ (or ~30bln$ by the time all coins are minted) is almost nothing. Large orders would easily manipulate the market at that price.
The only way it could realistically end up as both viable and &lt;1200$ would be if there somehow formed a universal consensus of the exact value of bitcoins. I have more faith in supply&amp;demand than universal consensus..

The difficulty increase is proportional to the time under the previous 2 weeks. But that only increase it back up to the "current" 10 minutes. It does not try to "compensate" for "lost" time.
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:27:54
No, because within these 2 weeks the average block time will slowly decrees every day that more power is added. So on average, the block time will be less than 10 minutes.

I think you misunderstod me about prices in bitcoin.
I ment; nobody values things in bitcoin. I don't value my camera at 1 BTC, and then price it thus. I value my camera at the expected price in my local currency (or expected price where I want to sell it), and then convert that to the equivalent in bitcoin. Unless bitcoin manage to become the new world currency, this change will likely not to come in the foreseeable future.

The problem with PoS right now is that Bitcoin is the only none-forgable asset that works for PoS. Prior to Bitcoin there was no such asset that could be used for it!
This means that all other decentralized crypto-currencies that use PoS are derivatives of the current distribution of Bitcoin! This currently creates a very unfair advantage to people holding a lot of Bitcoins, and is a good reason why most currencies using PoS a.t.m. will probably fail.
There is no reason why Bitcoin can't switch to PoS in the future. However, PoS is still very immature compared to PoW, and a lot of work is needed in the area to determine if it could be a reliable alternative.

I can only speak for myself, but; I hold bitcoins now, because I think the future market value of bitcoin is higher than it is today. Not because I belive Bitcoins will rise in value for ever as a deflationary currency. When I feel the market has come to a fair consensus about the value of Bitcoins, be that 10$, 100$, 1000$ or 1mill$, I will be more than willing to spend it.
Greshams law is absolutely interesting, but I'm not sure how relevant it is when it becomes more trivial and stable to exchange frictionless between fiat and bitcoin. That bad money drives out good isn't bad for bitcoin - it's bad for individual countries.
I'm not of the opinion Bitcoin will be a traditional currency - I think it will be used because it has technological aspect that enables new ways to transfer wealth.

If you guess 100 times a second, and find a hit every 1000 guess it would be 10 sec between each time you solve a puzzle which the pool can verify. Then the pool can calculate your computing power. 
If you guess 100 times a second and find a hit every 100,000,000,000 guess it would take too long time between each time you solve the puzzle and the pool would never know how much computing power you contributed. 
But its all random, so you could have guessed it on 1, 10, 100 or 10000000th guess. You are always solving the same puzzle, but you report all finds of the lower difficulty.
Let's say the task is: find a random number higher than X. A difficulty of 10 makes it easy and 100000000 is harder. You tell the pool when you solve the easy one, but you still have shots of the harder one.

You can't eat gold, so you value it after what you can get for it. I can't sell my house for 1 oz of gold if the gold plummets in local value -  It would be more rational to sell it in local value and trade for more gold than I would have gotten initially.

Hardly an unsecured line either.

WHY CAN'T I TRANSFER MONEY TO MY MASTERCARD INSTANTLY FROM MY DEBIT ACCOUNT IN THE SAME BANK.
*edit: it occurse to me you might just have had a reading problem; I did in no way go over any credit limit. I had more than enough money in my account. I transfered money to mastercard which didn't go trough instantly, but cleared from my bank account, leaving me with none on either

But that means it will only rise in value ("deflation") if it gains value.. This is true for EVERYTHING.

Oh, I did know money aren't transfered on holidays. 
I just transfered money and crossed my fingers and hoped there was any common sense in the system since it was an in-bank-transactions, which usually never require "real" transfers.
It was just frustrating to have the solution (mastercard) to the problem (a missing visa card) right there in my pockets - yet for "no" reason being unable to use it (transfer it money).
Then to add insult to injury, the money I sent from debit to credit was "locked in limbo" for the whole easter, so even if I would have gotten ahold of my card it too would also be unfunded!!

The computer generates a "random number" based on the text. It's practically impossible to find the text given the number, but trivial to check that the text gives the correct number. The task is to find a number that is lower than a certain difficulty requirement. 
This difficulty is adjusted (according to the network computing power) now and then to make sure the work required to find it takes about 10 min. 
The pool sets their own artificial requirement (according to your computer power), so that you might find a block every now and then. By checking  how fast you find these artificial blocks, the pool can calculate your share in the pool!

Very good point.  I don't think it's possible to rule out speculation.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:12:02
A very simple explanation, based on how this would work in my head:
X bitcoins are sent to an address with a script that says it belongs to a sidechain.
The sidechain now has a "genesis" owner with 100% (X btc). The sidechain are free to operate however it like, independently from the mainchain.
Doing transactions on the sidechain further divides the 100% into multiple smaller  parts, where each fraction now has a MagicTM proof of ownership as a % of the X bitcoins. 
By burning your % of the sidechain, you get a magical signature you can show the mainchain, which allows you to transfer your % of the X original BTC.
This makes small transactions possible, since they do not need to be processed by the mainchain. Sidechains can do all the small work, and the mainchain needs only to consider the "important" transactions.
Think of it like this: Sidechains for each planet. Each planet has a block time of 10min. Since communication is slow between planets, the mainchain in the middle has a block time of 1 day. Now everybody can do small transactions on their planets, but every day, huge transactions will be done between planets.

Since Bitcoin isn't bound by a state, it makes no sense for people in a country to value things in BTC. They will "always" value things compared to their countries fiat. Goods won't be worth more or less because of bitcoin-deflation - but you will be able to buy more with your bitcoins.

60% control gives you 60% chance to fake a double spend in 1 block. If the double spend is done in public the receiver would decide to wait for more blocks before accepting the payment since they will see the double spend. 
If the double spend is done in private it has a 40% chance of failing for each block. If we assume the receiver want to wait 6 blocks before accepting the payment the double spender will need to mine 6 blocks in private in a shorter time than the rest of the network. There is a 4.5% chance of them doing that (60%^6). That means they are 95.5% likely to lose all the possible block rewards for the 6 blocks they could have mined!

That's not how fractional reserve banking works.
If 10 people deposit 10$ each, the bank can loan out 90$ of it and earn loan interest on it.  They are only required to keep 10% in liquid assets, in case people want to withdraw money.
It doesn't matter if it's $ or bitcoin. The ledger doesn't change anything. The ledger does make it possible to audit and/or prove an arbitrary fractional holding level, but that doesn't change the fact that fractional reserve banking is still possible.

It perfectly agrees with everything i said.
 You can not start a bank, have 10$ deposited and lend out 100$. How will you pay out the 90$? Please tell me.
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:07:45
Jesus christ. I realize you don't know what you are talking about, and are just copy pasting wiki links while watching crappy youtube conspiracy videos about the banking mafia, but if anybody else reads this thread, I'll explain it for them:
Banks can't loan out money they do not have! If they could, anybody could start a bank, deposit 1$, take out a 10$ loan, deposit 10$, take out a 100$ loan, etc. Yey, you are now the  richest person in the world. 
The money would first need to be deposited to them. 
Fractional reserve banking works because all the people who deposit money seldom want to withdraw the money at the same time. Hence, 90% of the money can be returned to the economy instead of sitting under and mattress and losing value to inflation. There is no magical unethical bank conspiracy where they make the money from thin air. 
How it does work is, 10 people deposit 10$. The bank pays out a 90$ loan, while having 10$ in reserve in case a person want to withdraw their money. The 90$ is returned to the economy, and can be further utilized again. If this 90$ in turn gets deposited to a bank, the same can happen again. In the end the economy ends up with a total of 1000$, instead of the "real" 100$ from the beginning.  This is the money multiplier for a 10% reserve. 
Now, all of this hinges on only one thing. The assumption that all the people who put the money in the bank don't all withdraw  their money at the same time. If they did, a bank run would occur. The bank would have to get back enough of the money they loaned out, to be able to give back the money.  This is where the issue of trust comes into play for a fractional reserve economy. 
But wait, there's more! Why do people willingly put their money into banks, when there is such a risk!? Because of interest rates. You see, the bank are actually paying you for being able to use your money, so they can make even more money with your money! And guess what; how the bank earn the money doesn't matter! It doesn't have to be trough loans. In fact, almost all banks also have investment portfolios to put money into. 
Regardless of inflation or deflation, fractional reserve banking will continue to be a thing, as long as unused capital can be put to better use. If bitcoin is expected to rise with 10% each year and a bank thought it instead could make 20% gains from unused capital, they would gladly pay you 15% interest rate to be able to use your unused money! 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:17:42
No. You can not start a bank, have 10$ deposited and lend out 100$. How will you pay out the 90$? Please tell me.
You can have 100$ deposited, lend out 90$, thereby incressing the economy by 90$.

@_date: 2017-10-01 10:15:05
You don't put money into banks because you need a place to store them. You put money into banks because you get paid for it via interest. As long as it is possible to earn more money on unused capital then the inflation/deflation rate, fractional reserve banking will happen.  
If bitcoin is expected to rise with 10% each year and a bank thought it instead could make 20% gains from unused capital, they would gladly pay you 15% interest rate to be able to use your unused money!
People are greedy, so they will put their money at the most lucrative interest-over-risk ratio they can find. If that is etherum, then sure, fractional reserve banking will be useless. But that is highly improbably, as it would lead to everybody staking into etherum, making it less and less lucrative until it ends up at the average economical growth.

If you sent bitcoins to f.ex. 1burnmybitcoinsforeverandeverever, nobody will  "ever" be able to generate the private key that corresponds to it by chance.

Theoretically it has one, but it is unknown and almost impossible to discover.
Normally you make a public key by generating a private key at random, and perform some one-way-functions to generate the corresponding public key.
For the burn-address, you make a fake public key (1aaaaaaaa..) where only the last few characters are a "random" checksum (...aaaaBdc1) to make sure it's a valid key. Since it wasn't generated from a private key, the only way to find the private key is by brute force (luck/chance) but in this case, that is practically impossible. You are more likely to find at least 50% of all other private keys before you find this particular one. And just finding one random one is  impossibly hard.

Somebody should make a bot that replies to comments with text containing "0.XXXX (btc|xbt|bitcoins)" with the calculated value in bits!

Maybe not right now, as all previous exponential peaks have corrected quite a bit afterwards. But it's impossible to say if it will correct higher or lower, so you have to follow your gut feeling on that. Maybe wait for the correction and hope you can buy a bit cheaper. Or wait until it corrects higher and buy at a "loss" compared to now.
However, the important part is to decide: Do you think Bitcoin has long term promise? If you do, Yes, you should invest a bit of money if you can afford it. 
And then you should hold on to them, and not sell, no matter what the price goes to. If you believed in the technology, the short term price and adoption from everybody else shouldn't matter to your perspective. 3 years from now, the will either skyrocket or be worth 0. That's whats important. Not the price tomorrow.
To help Bitcoin succeed, it's also important to make it a more viable currency. Set up a coinbase account, to refill to your limit every time you spend. That way you can stimulate the Bitcoin economy by spending Bitcoins, while also keeping your investment!

No, everybody should have access to bitcoins! However, INVESTING is a different game. Bitcoin is made for transactions, not for the good of the early investors.

I didn't sell, and don't plan to what ever the price becomes. Either the 50$  I put into it 2 years ago becomes my retirement fund, or fuck it, it wasn't much money anyway. I believe Bitcoins are the future of international money transfers, so for me this is a long term investment no matter what. 
I've gone trough both bubbles "knowing" the crash would come, but I've been holding both times. I would kick myself if it turned out I sold my investment at the wrong time, just for a quick slump of money..
The bubbles only contribute to correct the price, get more people aware of Bitcoins and diversify the Bitcoins held by the early adopters who are cashing out. Good for the long term survival of Bitcoin!

Im implying no such thing. In addition, i still think  time is ticking.

Found what I was looking for: Digital signature
Private key encrypts a message, x: E(x, private) = Y
Public key decrypts the message, Y: D(Y, public) = x
To make sure you can prove ownership of private key and a text:
x = "public+text"
E(x, private) = Y
Send the public key, text and signature: public+text+Y
Using public key you can now decrypt Y to "public+text", which shows that it's equal to the sent text and key.
However, it's now impossible to change the text and re-encrypt it with the public key!
It's amazing that this proves that you know the private key, with out even sending something of it back and forth..

Then either A or (not A) is wrong, and does not have an unshakable belief that will stand the test of time.

Undercooking the rice actually increases the performance of the miners, since heat release a lot of the energy  stored in rice!

This is how I used to do it many years ago..
    results = query("UPDATE table SET value=value-5 WHERE value&gt;=5 AND ID=1")
    if (results == 1) YEY!
(Is this still a reliable method?)
