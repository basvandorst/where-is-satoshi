Very good points. I need to check out zerocoin.

agreed. I'd hate to see Bitcoin become just another payment method controlled by the banks when it could be a catalyst for so much more.

It works very well as a currency but it is a scarce "resource" so to speak. There are no widely used currencies in the world that have a fixed supply. This makes it very hard for people to treat like a currency. Its a simple economic fact that I think is getting muddled because people think its a knock on Bitcoin.

The deflationary argument is an interesting one because many economist believe that a steady rate of inflation is necessary to keep the economy moving and to encourage spending. I think this is where our economy and its participants need to undergo a transformation... As long as our psychological need for growth exists (in numbers, not necessarily in value or production), we will need an inflationary currency. Bitcoin could be a contributing factor in breaking this infinite growth paradigm that causes wild fluctuations in economic output and consumption.

Yes, there is some value here... if the regulators don't change this.

Yea there are definitely other exchanges but everyone seems to be flocking to the same one which has over 70% of the market! 
See ebaley's link below! sorry for repeating.
