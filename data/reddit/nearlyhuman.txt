First of all, like many others, I want to applaud your generosity and the signal it sends to the broader community (and society at large) that there's more to Bitcoin and Bitcoiners than just hodling for a greater fool.
On to actual giving. I think there are many dimensions you can toggle in terms of resourceful giving: belief in God, immediate cost-effectiveness, sustainability, systemic change, species-wide existential threats, to name a few. However, nearly everyone would agree I think that within such variation you would do well to invest in verifiably useful solutions implemented by organizations with verifiable track records - much the same way you would choose your crypto portfolio. The reason that non-profits are one of the easiest ways to make a quick buck is because too often one of the commodities bundled together with impact is trust - simply because it takes far longer (sometimes infinitely) for the consumers of a charity to hold it accountable, compared to the consumers of a normal business.
I am a Christian and claim a value system very different from Holden, Singer and other utilitarians, yet I still believe GiveWell.org (non-OPP) recommendations represent some of the lowest risk giving opportunities across all causes simply due to their calibre of statistical analysis (always or almost always requiring RCTs), on-site interviewing, expert discussions. E.g. even if you think they underweight autism by 5x in terms of lost utilons per person or underestimate chance of terminator by 500x, you still might want to go with their recs given the possibility that comparative advantages in org efficiency, room for funding, certainty of tangible good done, scalibility/sustainability of their solution, etc. multiply out to more than a factor of 5 (or 500) in your estimation.
If U look at what their researchers have come up with and compare it to something like Charity Navigator not to mention whats posted on the sites of mega charities etc. It's like comparing technical arguments of Bitcoin to those of Bcash:

Not really sure what's happening here; can't he just apply wrench until you give up second key?
Only wrench immunity is when it's physically and provably impossible (by you or anyone) to access keys for a month. And not just keys but an encrypted version of the key that will require attack to be elevated to one month kidnapping. Such service is what's really needed, honestly.

Hi I clicked on this link like a dummie, got a blank page, do I have anything to worry about?

Kidnapping yourself is too easy for this to ever be an option

Except if this is a reality what % of time locked transactions will be truly time locked as opposed to fake time locked come on boys
Edit: I just realized you could encrypt and put the shortcut key in a fingerprint-access bank vault, hmmm

Obviously, don't do this.

Is there a way for vendor to prevent firmware from being changed w/o vendor dig sig?  Do you know what functionality this would impair?

Newbie question, is it possible to hack / change the code of hardware wallets?  What would this take?

In a way Microsoft's PC monopoly worked out really well for crypto users

No, the person buying it from you can't know that you didn't duplicate the private keys.
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:41:49
True that would be the only way to do it.  But then, the buyer would probably expect you to send the BTC out yourself.

Point was to sell s2x coins while they still have value... or am I missing something?

Pitchforks aside, how likely is it that Coinbase, Gemini, and Blockchain.info have some non-public access to what exactly the miners will do, and have waited this long to confirm that the 'majority hashrate' chain will definitively be Bitcoin (1MB)?  
At some point it's just hard to imagine that Coinbase is so grossly incompetent at PR as to make this ridiculous flip-around otherwise.  They should be crafting their statements to cater to as many customers as possible both before and after fork, and there are clearly enough on both sides to warrant extremely careful language right now - which might just mean they're very sure 2x will be minoritized (otherwise too high probability that Core supporters will give them hell for reneging on the wording of their previous post).
In fact, has ANY miner claimed they will be devoting ALL hashrate to the 2x chain?

XMR vs Taproot and why?
@_date: 2019-05-21 06:16:44
Good point and calls for a good answer.
I'll give it a shot.  Couldn't you make the same argument for, say, the real estate of a small island?  That early settlers who see clear potential for a micro-economy developing on the island are getting a 'free lunch' by staking out with minimal effort land claims that can only grow in value?  Likewise for holders of extraction rights of fixed commodities on the island.
Now, replace the island with a pre-Columbian continent.  How does Bitcoin differ?
