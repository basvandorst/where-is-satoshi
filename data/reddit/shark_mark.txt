I though that if the transaction wasn't confirmed in three weeks it became void and the coin returned to the senders wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:39:38
Im a huge advocate for Bitcoin, but mannnnn thats bullish!

Ohh sorry im with you now..

By the time they got registered on an exchange (days or more) and was able to buy the coin, the hack would have been exposed.

Hope so!!! lol! Its funny, I would like to see myself as a hardened to this shit, but every time it happens, it feels just as disheartening as the last. Eyes on the prize, a decentralised currency and power with the people!

Different currency, like what? Fiat is dying, it’s over inflated and outdated in this digital era. Gold in not fungible and is unsuitable for a currency. Most other crypto currencies are a joke.
Bitcoin is the only truely decentralised, time tested digital currency and most of the world doesn’t even understand it yet. Until the world wakes up to this revolution, it’s true value will be unknown.
To answer your question, no.

One of the largest exchanges in a 300 billion dollar market capped virtual commodity, pretty sure they are past the 'basement' phase. This was blatant insider trading in a, now Wall Street connected market.

Last time I tried being a smarty pants day trader (bitcoin) it cost me a lot (over 5k) of cash. Lesson learnt. If you believe in the technology and are in it for the long term then you have to just ride the waves. The reality is that nobody knows what will happen tomorrow, up, down, whatever, in the scale of things it doesn't matter. Everyone likes to see quick returns on their investment and its true that when it drops it causes fear and unsettlement. Zoom out a little on bitcoins life trend and you will see many of these dips. This one are currently experiencing is directly, or indirectly a cause of the futures, but this is also a necessary step towards mass adoption. Im rambling on a bit now, but the point is if your in for the long haul, then just buckle down and hodl on!

Bitcoin.org is defiantly above bitcoin.rogerverisacock.com, however the latter has a bitcoin symbol to the right of it which makes it stand out more. Tested on an iPhone.

Bakkt, ETFs and others in the works. A question if I may.. why the fuck are you here posting if don’t believe in BTC? You really must have very little to do if your wasting your time in a forum about something you clearly have little interest. Kinda sad really.
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:05:30
Interesting to read this and compare to today’s market. It also really makes me think that TA doesn’t work with BTC.

Horseshit, once institutional players step in, the price will move very rapidly. Don’t underestimate FOMO. Once things hit 10k again you’ll be surprised how fast the average Joe does a complete 180 and starts throwing money at it..

I suppose that is correct, there would need to be more transparency. The customer would have options which are currently not available to them, i.e. be their own bank.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:03:26
Similar to a conventional bank I would expect, without the fractional reserve element though of course.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:32:26
I certainty wouldn’t be interested in any services a bank might offer, but people who are less familiar with crypto might require them. I suspect that would change over time though.
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:18:41
This model has a flaw. It should be based on a model which considers current wealth distribution as a large portion of the worlds population will never own any BTC as they do not currently have any fiat to purchase it with.

All good mate, it was my fault, trading BTC against BCH. I did really well initially and was about 2.5k up, I had drawn it and the cash was sat in the reserve. BCH was still rising and I (with my wife in my ear (lol not her fault)) a bought in again and it just rocketed down. Lesson learnt. HODL!

What would be the odds if a third party had something big on Craig and were blackmailing and funding him to do this in an attempt to disrupt and tarnish Bitcoin? I see no real benefit in him trying to claim this title otherwise.

I would imagine less than 1 million people in the world will ever 1 full bitcoin. I haven't done the math, but when you think of the amount of people with over 1 (some with over a hundred thousand ( it dramatically reduces the opportunity for other to hold a full coin. So well done!!

I’m not super keen on the CMC changes, there’s too much going on in the dashboard, though adding a portfolio tracker was a good move.

Is that what happened before December?! No, look at the charts mate. Maybe it is dead this time. Maybe. Personally I doubt it, but the reality is that every time it has done this prior to 2018 it has raised in value.
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:43:26
Bitcoin is not controlled by a single entity (an arguably corrupt one at that). The decentralised nature of bitcoin makes it a better option for the modern world. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 08:37:23
BTC settled futures, it should create an fair bit of volume and liquidity in the market.
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:09:16
I’m not a huge fan of banks, however, this seems like a great way to get the average person using BTC. The reality is that it is fairly difficult to use and easy to make mistakes, keep safe, etc., at this stage. Oblivious people have faith in banks, so it could be a good way to get things moving.

Horse shit. They love their customers being in dept, thats their business. They couldn't give a single fuck if you as an individual,  go out and max out your cc on toys, beer, hookers, whatever. The real issue here is that they don't want people to use crypto.

My advice to you would be this - If and when whatever you decide to put it in doubles in value, pull half of it and pay off the loan. This way your playing with money that has cost you nothing.
