I would assume there's a fairly large number of people who have done this on any large exchange. From a technical perspective it's most likely cheaper to just reimburse the customer out of the exchanges own stash than to try and recover the lost coins. So any exchange would have to eat the cost of any customer who is negligent enough to deposit to the wrong address. It makes sense business wise to just have a blanket rule of no reimbursement.

It's literally lost, they won't pay you because if they did that for every newbie who deposited to the wrong wallet they would spend a fortune.

The regulations that go into implementing a system like this are immense. I've been attempting something similar and the biggest challenges are insurance and domestic licensing. Programmatically it's pretty damn easy all things considered, but if you don't have a partner in the financial industry you are basically fucked.
