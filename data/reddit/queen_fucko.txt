What he used is fine, using a smaller unit is pretty common when doing actual analysis instead of crafting talking points.

Yeahhh... that's not accurate. What she testified to is the fact that the fed is in fact audited quite regularly, but the kind of audits and oversight proposed by certain Republican representatives would threaten the independence of the fed. Something which is essential to a functioning monetary policy regime.

Tbh, this is the level of understanding of many people that are individual coin investors (gamblers). There is a lot of dumb money here. Personally I'm not to interested in holding any coin. I'm here because of my interest in the decentralized ledger and the possibility of replacing our current payment and funds transfer systems.

Yeah, the numbers and scale in this thing are all screwy. There is a lot things like this in the bitcoin community. It's just like the gold Rush with prospectors being promised riches, when really many will not make anything on their investment.

Nah, you just don't get it.

Ounce for ounce Bitcoin is already worth more than gold.
That being said, comparing Bitcoin (a currency), gold (an asset), and something like SPDR (equities index fund) is fucking insane and pointless. They each have their part of the financial sphere. If you are using one to fill in for another you're an idiot.

Seriously, this isn't a typewriter.

This is the right answer. Look at the size of the standard hole for the hook

Seriously, a brokerage is not a fiduciary just an intermediary.

No investment is long term at 85.

That's a general rule of thumb, but some people need more on hand, especially the self employed.

Seriously, savings accounts are for cash you need liquid at a moment's notice, but not necessarily right now. They are great for preventing your cash on hand safe from being drained, like your checking account can be as well as having a higher interest rate. Tbh, you shouldn't be investing in anything unless you familiarize yourself with the basic financial instruments available to and their strengths and weaknesses. Without doing that basic research you should be letting a fiduciary handle your financial planning and even if you know what you are doing they are good to consult.

Your argument is semantics, ours is legal. You don't know what you are talking about.

Personally I think either Apple or Google is going to launch their own crypto tied to their payment platform and you'll get some free coins that they will provide with the purchase of the device. They can cherry pick their features and then since Android and Apple pay are already in place they could dominate the market. I don't invest in crypto because I still think a new coin could make the others obsolete fast.

Yeah, this dude is gonna get a knock on the door from the FEC. It's essentially just a dropbox with a sign that says "plz don't donate more than $50"  on it unattended.

Not only that, but at that age he really shouldn't be investing in volatile assets. Long term end of life care, if he ends up needing it, is extremely expensive and his assets need to remain stable. Bonds funds are where he needs to be vested. He doesn't necessarily have the luxury of being able to hold through a dip.
If it's a hobby he can go hog wild. If it's to leave to someone else, he really shouldn't be investing in things he can't figure out on his own.

Not even close.

I really think the parallels with the rise of crypto coins and the gold rush are quite striking. (It's also the reason I'm only very casually into crypto.) There are real riches to be had, with lots of pitfalls, scams, and money to be made supporting the miners with crypto fever. Like when the GPU supply dried up like the shovel supply did during the gold rush only for there to be a glut as people gave up during last crash. Or scam coins which were kinda of like mine stakes full of fools gold to trick good old miner 69er.

Yeah, I was 99% sure he was going to lie on the hammock with his dick sticking through the hole. What happened afterwards was anyone's guess, but this is just no.
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:56:04
Agreed. Kinda surprised hearing this from you though. I guess having worked at Accenture really opened your eyes to the cruelty of man.

Woah Crash was being an asshole.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:15:39
False. Don't try and time market fluctuations. You don't know how deep this dip will go or if there is a bottom. If you think there is a future buy whenever and hold.

Wow, a comment that is insensitive to 9-11, the Holocaust, and the Rwandan Genocide. That's some next level edgelord bullshit.
