Worth a try! Good job though man, I think I'd have been in the same position if I was a little bit older, I still think the same kind of % increase will be made if investing nowadays though, are you still holding? That'd be the hard part for me

Loyalty isnt what its about when you hold, its more about prediction rather than blind loyalty.

Shouldn't that be a positive if it's going to be a global currency? Other countries aren't going to adopt the currency if one of the countries control it.

How much did you invest and how much did you make, aprox if you don't mind me asking?

Why would transaction fee skyrocket? Capitalism would dictate in that instance that it'd drop, and become nothing. Banks would accept the coin and have 0 transaction fees.

Yeah, but hype dies down and people will only start paying what it's actually worth without the hype factor.

Whenmit was going up, people overpaid what it was actually worth due to hype, and expecting it to keep raising. Basically the price was at 4400 not because thats what it was worth logically, but because of the hype. I called it would happen, the good news is that itll keep climbing overall.

I agree with everything you say, but why wouldn't they use bitcoin?

The problem with a coin coming along that has better technology is that a few months after that happens, another coin will come along with better technology. It's better to just ignore all tech, as the benefit is brief and will be cancelled out in a short while after by another, improved improved coin.

100% agree with your strategy atm, as I just said in discord I think the price will drop a decent amount short term but obviously long-term it'll continue to grow (as usual). The hype for the cost increase will attract a lot of newer buyers and the hype will drive up the price above the actual value of the coins a bit. Can tell you know your shit, makes me happy we've come to the same conclusion. Can't wait till I get a fuckton of disposable income so I can get in on this.

What is the minimum to trade on Kraken? I have like 2 dollars worth of bitcoin, would it actually be possible to fuck around with it for a bit?
