if what you guys claim is true, all you executives are fckn incompotent for not seeing this coming. you should also be responsible for defrauding investors due to your inaction and i am hoping so.

you also defrauded shareholders and stole our money.

I agree, the amateurs that have been flooding this reddit lately ffs. I'm done.

People can't even accept the existence of universal digital currency at the moment let alone 2 of them co-existing...

ignore most of the cult members in the subreddit, they keep bashing anything or anyone who mentions Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin Cash is a fork of the original Bitcoin with superior block size. It is superior in payment handling due to lower fees.  There are some concerns with Bitcoin Cash namely the small development team and ASICMining capable (which was fixed in original Bitcoin).  There is no attack.  Bitcoin Cash has just been openly supported by certain Bitcoin Advocates as of late and has caused the Bitcoin price to dip and the Bitcoin Cash price to inflate.

my question is isnt it a fair assumption that our processing power and storage ability will only continue to increase for each individual and be even more readily available? It may not be available to all now but certainly we access to cheaper and better hardware every year

title is misleading, it is not the official payment method of japan

From a buyers perspective, Visa earns you points, provides protection, appears to be instant and free. Functionally wise it is better and I am a bitcoin advocate.

i suggest you wait until after this segwit complication concludes
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:12:09
Yes and I don't think it will be the last. The risk is very real.
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:11:19
safest option is cash at the moment
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:59:26
it's 100% speculation

we need to do all we can to make it appeal to the mainstream.

People see $700 and they instinctively think bubble. If they see $7, they won't bat an eye and might just concentrate a bit more on what Bitcoin has to offer. That is what i'm saying.

I speak to the average day Joe on a daily basis about Bitcoins.  The massive price illusion is a huge barrier to entry.  We need a smaller unit of measurement.
