You should not be putting money into BTC

Well you made a snarky reply to what will be the most upvoted piece of advice in the thread, maybe think on that? But that's also me saying "she started it!" and doesn't excuse my own snark. 
I stand by what I said, assess your strategy and what you can afford to invest...you should not be in a situation like this, you're counting on a downturn to reverse so you can afford to deal with an emergency? Just think about what you even asked. 
We all started as noobs. Don't tear yourself apart right now, sell your BTC for the emergency and do research, learn more about investing...we're still early in the crypto game my daughter! (sorry)

Hey son you asked about "the correction" as if this is a scheduled event with a timeframe, showing your noob colors. 
You also broke the basic rule of "only invest what you can afford to lose".
Furthermore you have weak little hands if you can't handle a tiny blip in a 9 month bull run.
You wanted our opinions right? Well daddy just told ya.

Finally got my 70 year old geologist Uncle to buy 2k worth of BTC last week on Coinbase, now he's emailing me asking about "Litecoin and E-thereum".
Even boomers are buying and they have the patience to hodl for years. BULLISH
