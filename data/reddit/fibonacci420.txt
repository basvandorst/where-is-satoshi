- Making the forums entirely public? (haven't checked in &gt; a year so I dont know if they already did that) "we are inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, and to secret oaths"
- Not allowing corporations to be members (would just help overall in every area including transparency)
- New leadership that cares a little more about what bitcoin is about rather than their corporate money interests

We all agree we need that, but its not here yet, so in the mean time lets not say "oh well, lets shut up and let ghash do this without any consequences". There is no regulation of bitcoin transactions but there sure as hell is regulation of companies, and I dont even mean regulation imposed by a centralized authority, rather consumer choice. You pretend your position is pro-free markets but its actually just pro-nihilism, pro-unhealthy free market. And you downvote someone who legitimately disagrees with you. Pathetic.

GHASH != BITCOIN
What part of this do you not understand? This guy is not suggesting we change the source code of bitcoin to block Ghash. Rather he is suggesting we put free-market consumer pressure on Ghash to try and get them to do what we want, the essence of the free market. Again, you are straw manning him. We all want a nice technical solution that would be more permanent. But until that happen, what do we do. Sit around and say Ghash is totally cool for going against every principle of this community stands for? How about try to convince them its in their interest not to act this way.

Agreed, mtgox fucked over only those who (stupidly) chose to keep their money  or trade there, ghash is fucking over us all.

There was no serious explanation why, so that right there is a lack of transparency. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:19:00
maybe he said that thinking for bitcoin's benefit, just like satoshi didnt want wikileaks getting in, for neg publicity. you are making a wild assumption unless you are a mind reader.

Yeah bro. The government did not run a Rockefeller et-al funded successful mind control program with the publicly documented result being the creation of the Manchurian candidate assassin (search mk ultra documents manchurian candidate). Hitler was not created by Rockefeller et-al funded American eugenicists and his first acts of genocide did not occur when he did not get suggestion letters WITH A FULL AND EXACT PLAN from american eugenicists and they did not publicly take claim for his actions (search american eugenics). 
I can go on a lot longer than you.

Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better about believing the lie. Have you heard the quote "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"? Well the skeptic / intellectual who wrote that also wrote about the idea of "pseudoskeptic" / "pseudoskepticism". I think you would benefit from reading the definition of that on wikipedia or somewhere. 
One thing to remember, if you are a skeptic, consensus in general is useless to you

would you publicly make fun of the intelligence of people inside of a religion that said as much? they pretty much all have something just as rediculous. You know 4% of the population believes the reptilian thing, according to respected mainstream news polls (look it up yourself)? thats more than there are jews in the world. Your continued posts, not just this one, are offending 4 out of 100 people in this country's personal beliefs.
personally I dont really "believe" in anything and I would not have any serious reason at this point to believe in reptilians unless I saw one. I am not a follower though I appreciate Icke's work on archaeological history and read those chapters in his books. I just think it is interesting that conspiracy theorists are one of the last groups who can be ridiculed and offended in public openly for their beliefs. Unlike you, I have studied the history behind it and I can form my own opinion with the proper information, so that I dont have a fear inside me that this guy could be right and I am wrong about everything, causing me to go on reddit and hate on him.

I know, I watched it, but supporting the CFR goes against a lot of what bitcoin stands for (if not everything), not to mention we have no idea if he had a private meeting right after

learning from his mistakes and/or maybe he is more interested in helping new bitcoin companies than pure profit. I have been scammed out of $500 once because it just didn't mean that much to me, I completely knew the risk and I made decision to take it... 19 times means he has been involved in 19 bitcoin companies, that's probably not out of pure practicality but a desire to help and test new bitcoin services.

yeah like that US military plane with 20+ tons of cocaine that crashed in south america. that would be nuts if that actually happened.
edit: that did not happen. that plane crashed with 4 tons of cocaine, and there was another plane carrying 20+ tons of cocaine. there are sources for both. hard to keep track.

With respect to them, they did not provide enough reasoning for me to concur. Claims that pools will always have incentive to conglomerate... Ok, why? Is that just speculation, because that's the bedrock of the whole idea?
And I think there is consensus we will find a technological solution (whether its getblocktemplate or something else) fairly soon, so I dont think there will be enough time for this to play out regardless.

Yeah but the NSA does stuff often without asking for legal permission often way out of their jurisdiction. Though in practice I agree with you, they wont care enough about going after a particular email site as to do an illegal operation.

If you ignore the tough questions then the rest of your PR talk is meaningless crap, and no one here will fall for it. 
Clearly says he will be paying dividends, written a year ago, once "the company shows sustained growth and profitability"
So, has your company been stalling for the past year or is your CEO full of crap? Which one is it?
Know I am completely neutral, I'm not Canadian, never heard of your exchange, I am just interested in this and bored. I have read both sides and obviously there Are some good aspects to your company but damn it, no amount of good aspects can cover this type of thing up. Where are the financial reports? Your company is entirely illegitimate without them, no amount of great plans and hopes and dreams and butterflies change this.
Oh, one more thing. You admit your company made many mistakes. Strongly inferred from this is that your CEO Joseph made a lot of mistakes. Here we are generally supporters of the free market, when a CEO fucks up a company he doesn't get to continue to mess around with it, we take our business somewhere better. To keep your CEO shows that there is no real change because at the end of the day you dont make the big decisions.

its beyond repair dude. its a corporate lobby for big business. the only thing they have is old money, and they dont even spend any of it and they are running out. this is the spirit of the free market, when something is shit, it gets replaced by better competition

You have probably heard the phrase "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." The very intelligent man who wrote that also wrote about the view you are expressing, pseudoskepticism. It is beyond naive to think a very abstract motto can be right about anything, especially complex things like human sociopolitical behavior, 99% of the time. 
The motto says not to attribute these events to conspiracy. It does not say to take the position against said events being conspiracies. It does not say that these events are not conspiracies, but rather that you should not assume they are conspiracies. Understand the difference. You, however, have taken that the other way and implied it means to assume things are not conspiracies. That goes against the whole point which is about not assuming when there are multiple possibilities, something any good conspiracy historian follows.

He is highly educated on politics and history. He has much real world experience. why are you hating without any provocation? just because it is culturally sanctioned and you get upvotes? 
I dont defend alex jones like hes a celebrity or something. 
Some of his products (nascent iodine and herbal hormone male vitality thing) are useful and all the ingredients are backed by scientific research and consensus. iodine deficiency and xenoestrogens are serious mainstream scientific issues (that AJ has helped push). 
Some of his products are just dumb and should not be used, colloidal silver (do some damn research, there's a reason Jones doesn't flaunt colloidal silver research like he does for iodine and such, it aint in existence post 1960), and his kool aid which has or had heavy metals and mercury in it and on the label (see mark dice on this).
