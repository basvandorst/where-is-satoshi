A collage of what?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:55:10
Care less
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:12:04
No, just that no one gives a fuck that you caught obvious spam. Pat yourself on the back buddy, you’re so very fucking special

They are still based of the underlying asset which has to be delivered. At least that’s my understanding. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:51:36
Does anyone in this sub know the difference between your and you’re? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:27:59
It’s “you’re” as in “you’re an idiot”
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:40:47
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:30:41
What is LTE? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:41:35


I’m confused. Can’t decipher this typo 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:28:45
Bet he can’t
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:32:14
Not funny
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:10:56
How the fuck does that even apply here? Their story is fucking pointless and deserved my response
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:21:49
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:41
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:09:32
Lol yep
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:22:13
Still affects the spot market 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:40:15
Nice maymay
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:35:43
Cool story, Hansel
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:05:44
Ah, right. Duh
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:57:35
Are the French not allowed to take their money out of their banks? Lol
Are you a fucking child? Take your fucking money out of this bank and write a complaint letter to whomever will fire this ignorant fuck
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:28
Yeah, you can only buy a whole one 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:42:15
Maybe you’re just an idiot. That’s my bet anyway
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:00:28
No one fucking cares if you upvoted. Why the fuck even mention that shit
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:49:40
18k worth though? I’m guessing no
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:32
What did it say
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:34
Prob just a mushier brain
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:07:55
His fucking crazy?
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:55:13
It’s more like $200,000,000,000.01
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:56:15
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:17:15
“Noone”   “Your” just an idiot 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:11:38
How do you get that when they never said how much they got the 25k or so initially? They sold at $100 but if they bought at $99 then they didn’t make shit
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:42:21
Lame af
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:03:01

@_date: 2018-02-01 20:16:00
By left wing do you mean statists?
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:37:04
I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that....
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:24:11
