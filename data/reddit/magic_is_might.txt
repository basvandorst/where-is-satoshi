Er, no. You're confused about the difference between a debit card and an actual credit card:
**Debit card** - you can get one from your bank when you open an account. Does not require a credit check. It is linked to your own money in your account. It most likely has a Visa or Mastercard logo. This allows you to use it in online purchases and when you make a purchase online, it doesn't need a PIN number. It is ran as a credit card BUT it pulls the money directly from your own bank account and own money. It's not an actual credit card.
**Credit card** - this DOES require a credit check and is something you have to apply for. You know why? Because you are  *borrowing* money from a financial institution with the promise that you will pay it back with your own money. You are not actually using your own money when you make a purchase. The credit card company pays for the purchase and you're supposed to pay them back, maybe with interest. Hence why you have to apply and pass a credit check to get one because you have to be proven to be trustworthy with borrowed money.
Debit cards that can be used online as a credit card =/= credit card. The difference is the debit card you use online uses your own money. A credit card borrows money and you pay that back. Google is a great resource to learn very basic things like this. Or you're only like 15 and pretending you know more than people who actually have debit/credit cards.
I buy shit all the time online with my **debit** card and it required zero credit checks.
