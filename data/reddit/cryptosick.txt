People age and get older.
Every year the new younger person is going to join the party then age out of it. It's a repeating cycle. Thats what keeps everything going.

When the internet boomed in the late 1990s maybe some people thought there would only be 1 website.
Now there are millions of websites that offer diff things.
People want variety. People want choice. People love trading crypto especially because the block chain has leveled the playing field for humanity. All you need is a smartphone and access to the internet to become a trader. Crypto currency is worldwide. It's not isolated to Silicon Valley types. 
Many Many coins will be created and people will love trading all of them. 
There is room for everyone.

Those are good numbers but I made 42K+ off that crash a few days ago. I made it in 1 trade and my 42K+ keeps going up and up as each hour passes. All within 5 days.

I don't think you understand that crypto day traders can make way more in a few days what you are saying you can make by mid June.

Panicking every time the price drops is noob behavior.
My advice to them would be to just get it over with and sell low the buy high. Then count your losses and shit your pants. Just get it over with because the Noob is going to make that mistake no matter what.
THEN, once they feel the pain a few times they will have learned the Art of the HODL.

Why would you buy bitcoin at its current price?
If you have the money as you say then just invest into Litecoin. Wait until Litecoin hits $100 then sell and convert that into BTC.

Internet outage in China is a VERY real possibility because Trump is probably gonna start a war with North Korea.
China will be impacted heavily. Being it internet outage, power outage, nuclear dust cloud. who knows. but I see Trump having the US at war with North Korea by the end of August. If not by then, maybe by Thanksgiving time. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:11:07
Potential WAR.
because of Trump

".. the goddamn thing wont go away"
The same thing was said about Rap music. 
And now look at Dr.Dre, Snoop, Jay Z.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:36:39
seems like it.
Make sure your HODL Litecoin and have some USD ready to purchase Litecoin on Aug 1st if things don't go well for Bitcoin.

My recommendation would be to research a coin that is low in price and dump any extra money you have into that coin.
Example ripple, sia, Lisk.
Learn how to day trade.
Next thing you know you'll have thousands of coins and you won't need to invest anymore of your personal money into it because you'll be making ton of coin off each trade.
That is the fastest way to get somewhere with all this if your starting out with a small amount of money.
If you already have backing from someone or your own large amount of savings you can invest then it's just about picking the right coins and learning how to trade.
Also, get on Twitter and start following the kick azz day traders. 
Just to add: I invested $5,000 into an ICO and exactly 1 year later i cashed it out for $51,000. I used that money to pay for my awesome college experience and Degree. Lived on campus and did it all. Thank You Crypto.

Correct. The higher the tx fees the more it's going to become a store of value for millionaire investors. 
Small timers will be priced out and turn to ALT coins.
There is room for everyone and all coins.
This is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:50:54
It means that Bitcoin fees will rise, tx times will take longer and Bitcoin price will skyrocket because it will become mostly used as a store of value for the rich of the rich.
