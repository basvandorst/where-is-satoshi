Today the world's bitcoin stock is about 14,334,275. If all of this bitcoin were melded together, it would form a cube of about 1 electron per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a proton.) At $260 per bitcoin -- bitcoin's price as I write this -- its value would be $3.74 billion. Call this cube pile A.
Let's now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy huge amounts of cropland with output of a few 10s of million annually, plus small portions of the world's most profitable companies, earning more than 10s of millions annually. After these purchases, we would have about $1 billion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $3.74 billion selecting pile A over pile B?
A century from now the hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops -- and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. The companies you bought stock in will probably have delivered billions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more billions. The 14,334,275 bitcoins will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the butt, but it will not respond.

Their developers didn't notice anything. "Hufflepuff" aka "robinnhood" went back to PrimeDice to taunt them, winning over 100 bets at 49.5% odds to prove they had exploited the site publicly. If you do the maths you will see the likelihood of that happening is absurd. They even said they were exploiting the site it in chat.
They still haven't really explained it after all this time. It was obvious they had access to the seed, otherwise the results wouldn't have been possible.

So they prove they have the BTC, make the pre-paid order, get the order, then keep the bitcoins. Great thinking outside the box.

It takes $0 to keep bitcoin at it's current price. This post is purely based on a fundamental misunderstanding of economics and trading.
25 new coins are created every 10 minutes, so the "market cap" of bitcoin grows by roughly $6000 every 10 minutes despite no "new money" entering the system at all.
The spot price is governed by what people pay, not by how much money is poured into bitcoin every day.

Bitcoin is basically only used for exchanging value/purchasing power right now. I'm sure a distributed medical record system would be a valuable use of whatever chain hospitals will use but obviously the "coins" where the medical records are will not be worth anything, even though the chain is obviously very valuable.
It always boils down to the cost effectiveness of attacking the chain vs. the utility and value it can provide while being able to secure it effectively. I don't know if bitcoin would be used for such things but I am guessing if it was to ever happen they would be centrally controlled propitiatory chain with its own premined tokens.

The odds wouldn't be even for dice if it's under/over 49.5/50.5 would it? The probability of guessing 100 coinflips correctly at 50/50 chances would be 1 out of the number I posted though, I think...
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:52:10
Winning 100 coinflips in a row is beyond luck. The most ever recorded at that % was just-dice.com where I think it was 32 wins in a row. "robinnhood" only did this to prove that they had exploited the site.
While in statistics anything is possible, the odds of winning 100 coinflips at 50:50 odds is 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376 to 1, so it's probably fair to say they weren't just lucky.
When he was exploiting the site and actually withdrawing I'm sure they did it in such a way to ensure their % luck was only a standard deviation above the mean to look less suspicious, since they had full control over the outcomes.

What issues did he have with them? I'm not saying they're fraudulent, but by using a payment system outside traditional banking you're opening yourself to a whole new level of unnecessary risk.
Their assets are proven in their bank accounts. There are limits on how much cash you can withdraw sometimes but the electronic euros are still there like they always were. It's absurd to ask a company to prove their solvency just for an order. You honestly expect anyone here to believe they put all the money into bitcoin losing fees on either side of the trades as well as ACH fees just to prove to a buyer that they have money?
Proving they can cover a single order isn't proof of solvency anyway, they would need the entire value of the company in bitcoins. The whole post is absolutely ridiculous; it never happened.

You wouldn't own your private key for medical records I imagine. At least that's how the system would have worked in my head. It would have to be implemented like that as a countermeasure to reduce record falsification and medical fraud where it would be held and verified through a designated central authority who oversees the process and ensures only people with licenses, like medical practioners who would already be bound by codes of good practice and confidentiality.
That's just my take on it but I'm not an expert or anything. Every coin and chain will be different and whatever information it is will hold its own sort of value but ultimately I don't think any will work as effective tools in the real world if they're completely decentralised. But then it sort of begs the question as to whether or not they would need a blockchain at all or just better integration in their current systems. Maybe one day we'll know for sure

Assuming he was trading with existing dollars from balances which in all likelihood, he probably wasn't. Chances are if he was buying at a premium he probably wasn't paying with real money at all, which would explain the constant withdrawal issues as there was no money to be withdrawn.

There were no guarantees in the gamble, but I remember in April 2013 Mark basically shut down MTGOX at the ATH.

No he couldn't. There were no bitcoins left to arbitrage. People were trading GOXBTC with GOXFIAT, which were essentially IOUs backed by the false promises of Mark Karpeles and Roger Ver. They were imaginary bitcoins and money conjured out of thin air that only existed on paper, and in people's dreams.
People lured themselves in with greed and delusion. When those users were trading the numbers on their balances, nothing was changing but the numbers on their balances. No money or cryptocurrency was changing hands because there wasn't any there to fulfill withdrawals.

I never said land produces wealth by itself. That's why I said cropland that produces food. People use farms because they are cheap. The cost of using large scale hydroponics would outweigh the cost of the food and labour. For that reason, people use farmland instead of robot powered high-tower sea growing food production operations. The economy of scale could never compete with farmland.
Buying and selling oil contracts is speculating on the future price, just as buying land to flip for a profit is speculating, exactly the same way buying bitcoin in the hope of an increase in purchasing power is speculating. These methods of obtaining wealth are by definition high risk because you can't predict the future.
The low risk investing would be buying land irrespective of the price so you can continue to generate and income without needing to worry about the "price" of your land. The value of it is something very different.
Hedging your portfolio on the basis for a need for a speculative internet currency is severely risky. If that's what you're into, that's perfectly fine, but don't pretend it isn't risky.

@_date: 2015-07-01 11:27:25
Cropland is not worthless; land is a scarce limited asset that produces wealth. Millions of acres of hydroponic land would cost unimaginable amounts of money to build and maintain. So would the robots. We are a very long way away from that being a reality even though it's conceivable that it could happen. Modern agriculture is extremely cheap and efficient anyway, but still produces huge amounts of wealth.
Bitcoin's current purchasing power can essentially be deleted by Satoshi Nakamoto or even Roger Ver, or the Winklevoss. This is a fact. My original point was that bitcoins do no produce anything and that is true. 1 btc = 1 btc. The value of that coin only fluctuates based off what other people are willing to pay, and that's where the new wealth comes from. It's still generating wealth for you if you sell, but only because you're trying to generate wealth through speculation.

They are more rare as a % of other elements, but that doesn't mean there isn't much of them, there's just much more other stuff.
But of course gold production is ultimately a function of chance, predominantly through collision of stars. A paper by John E. Ross and Lawrence H. Aller estimate there is approximately 131,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 metric tons of gold in the universe. I'm guessing there is a lot of platinum too.

Why would a European spending Euros in Europe compare the Euro to the US dollar? It's not like if the Euro drops 50% against the dollar, everything doubles in price, it stays exactly the same.

No company can guarantee a profit, and 99% of "cloud mining" services don't actually own any hardware, they simply pay your daily "returns" with the money new "investors" deposit.
Every account in this thread saying they have had good experiences with them are old sleeper accounts likely bought to try and con more people into this obvious ponzi scheme.
Do not be fooled by these exorbitantly high returns, they are not possible with traditional investing. They are only possible through deception and fraud.
For the love of god, do not hand your bitcoins over to these savvy con artists, unless your goal is to lose those bitcoins forever. It might seem good at first, but never trust a guy with your 10 bitcoin investment because he drip feeds you 0.02 BTC with his imaginary "mining contract".

I don't even... You can use farm and properties as collateral for loans! The farm continues to produce and the property can still be rented out as you pay back the interest on the loan, the metals and crypto earns nothing in the process! It's the exact same utility, and you'll be taxed on your earning all the same. This is why there is less risk, regardless of the spot price of an acre, a 3 bedroom detached house, an ounce of gold or a bitcoin. You're earning passively.
*Let's say in a year you earn $100k worth of metals by yourself. In the same year I take the farm and property and use them as collateral for a loan to start a business that earns 1 million dollars. I've just gotten more utility out of my things that do something than you've gotten out metals and crypto that do nothing. Things are what you make of them. Wealth is produced by individuals and groups never by inanimate objects*

If you own your land and property then capital controls and a country defaulting on their sovereign debt doesn't effect you. In most of the world you do have the right to own your own land. That won't change over night now matter how pessimistic the outcome unless you're suggesting total societal breakdown across the world, in which case nothing will protect your assets. You can't be 100% safe from anything.
Farmland is not at risk; there is always a demand for food. The amount of people in the world isn't that relevant. You will still produce what you can produce, just that the free market will adjust the price of your produce accordingly. Even if 1/2 of the world died over night, you would still be producing wealth, that's the point. Speculating on peoples' need for food isn't really speculating anyway. You don't need to be a psychic to predict that somebody will need to eat food tomorrow.
The point that I'm still trying to hammer in here is in all that time, despite what or how much you are producing, bitcoin will have produced nothing in the same period. Instead of accumulating some wealth even in the world case scenario, you would just have been sitting on your ass waiting for people to buy more bitcoins to push the price up. It could very well happen, but it's significantly higher risk. It doesn't give you a property to live in, it doesn't give you land to have that property on, it gives you a private key that show numbers on a screen that is proof of a claim to electronic money.
Even by the biggest stretch if I was to consider hard productive assets a gamble, I would rather pick them over non-physical unproductive asset like bitcoin. In 20 years my farm and property could essentially pay for itself, and 1 bitcoin will still be 1 bitcoin. All that time gambling on the expectation that the rest of the world drives the price up so I can just buy more things with it.
