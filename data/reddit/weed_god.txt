Bitcoins were made I guess for it to be really decentralized giving people a chance to have a money when they do not have access to banks. This is why some governments are threatened by this, but some embrace it as they see a positive side to it specially with blockchain technology.

Doesn't having a centralized system for cryptocurrencies require more maintenance?

It's like looking for a pair of shoes but you got no feet..

Yup. It has more negative side for users than benefits. They change systems too fast not all users are able to keep up..

From what I know is that, it's the dude who created cryptocurrency then "disappeared"? But yeah, i'm open to any explanation to widen my knowledge about this guy.

Probably misunderstood your question since you had this thread started on r/bitcoin so I thought you were trying to find out something regarding cryptocurrencies.

Did they actually find him? Lol!

I'm a cheapskate, got any pdf file? I would really like to learn this. And what is the book about, mainly? Like what will the book teach us?

If, just if you prefer peer to peer platform give paxful a shot. Not so bad plus it's 24/7 customer service is there to help. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:57:30
Well, it's not so bad. I mean there's so much scammers in this platform but it's fine when you learn how to avoid or report them.

I think you're just being a little close minded about it, [bitcoin.org]( won't be stupid to accept a sponsorship if they do not see any positive objective about it for the future. And if you do want to stop your contribution, you can probably go ahead, probably the p2p platform provides waaaay more than you do.
