Oh noes!
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:08:39
So use another exchange or atm...
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:09:44
But I thought bitcoin was dying?

Welcome to bitcoin

make sure to incluide bitfinex and all tether exchanges in that since crypto capital is also part of the bitfinex tether scam
so basically... everywhere
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:35:55
seems like u didn't even do 10 mins of research on cex.io.
itts one of the crypto capital exchanges
guess what? crypto capital was indicted for bank fraud and money laundering and had over 800 million dollars seized

the largest trading firm for bitcoin is owned by DRW trading which is a us based trader.
they have also been sued for market manipulation in other markets to.
they are known in bitcoin as cumberland mining.

exchanges knowingly allowing illegal activity though are unlikely to play along. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:15:36
So then why do people spoof and wash trade if it's no big deal and doesn't affect anything?
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:44:12
any news on the bitfinex audit with friedman llp?
@_date: 2018-06-21 07:35:23
psst this is the same bullshit they tried back in september...
it's bullshit 
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:59:17
isn't kraken the exchange that allows tether to wash trade every day? theres a video on kraken showing all of the tether trades being the same somewhere.

Rats leaving the sinking ship, less than 3 weeks after criminal probe from department of justice and University of Texas publishing a report tether and bitfinex are counterfeiting money 
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:06:35


nothing was proven.


where was this?
@_date: 2018-06-21 07:35:39
aka tether and bitfinex
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:51:12
bloomberg would not publish the raids about imperial pacific if the raids didn't happen.
they would have retracted it by now if it was false.
a company laundering billions of dollars isn't going to admit to it. just like HSBC covered up their money laundering at first
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:00:09


it's not perjury unless they are under oath.
besides, they put in so many disclaimers that if bitfinexed turns out to be right they have no liability
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:45:34
That’s not credible at all and the former fbi guy has vouched for some bad people recently that are evading Justice 
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:42:03


hint: people lie.
if the FBI shut down bitfinex and tether right now and never did a press release about it, they would not confirm if they raided bitfinex or not and bitfinex would be free to lie and say they were never raided.

a law firm is different than an auditor.
think of tether hiring a law firm to represent them in a case where theres a video of phil potter robbing a bank clear as day with proof beyond a reasonable doubt, a video of the money ink packs exploding and his hands covered in red ink along with footprints leaving the bank all of the way to his get away car with gps tracking all the way to his house.
they will still try to argue why he's innocent because they represent him, not the bank, and not the banks customers.
if phil potter is decided to be guilty, nothing bad happens to the lawyer. he can't be sued for giving a defense to him, and really, he did nothing wrong anyway.
an auditor does not have this luxury.
they hired an auditor, the auditor refused to sign off on what they were doing because if the auditor signs off and it is fraud, the auditor is in deep shit.
so they hired a law firm instead.
a law firm where the one of the partners has ties to a casino that was raided by the feds just  3 months ago.
how interesting
in otherwords, the difference between a law firm and and auditor...
if the lawyer lies and gets caught, no punishment.
if the auditor lies and gets caught, holy shit punishment.
fun fact: ever notice how lawyers never have to swear to tell the truth unless they are on the witness stand in court? 
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:22:41
The lawfirm worked for a casino that was just raided for money laundering

GET YOUR MONEY OUT OF BITFINEX

The systemic risk is tether, nearly 80% of volume is against counterfeit dollars under criminal investigation right now
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:04:22
Show me Tethers full audit and not a report done by their own lawyers that explicitly states that it’s not for assurances 
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:01:07
No it isn’t, they have not done audits as required by the 
Whitepaper 
In fact they claim they can’t do the audit now. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:05:46
It’s all in tethers tho

I just learned about bitcoin this week, here's what needs to be done to fix it. Trust me, I'm an economist and I love Paul Krugman.

But but but wasn't apple pay going to kill bitcoin?
