Whilst I find this 'fun' to read - there just ain't no meat on the bone...  
I'm more interested in people using, building, and making 'stuff' - stuff is what will make this tech useful.  This is most important in my mind.

Two factor is great and all - but when ~70 million USD is on the line, I wouldn't count on any implementation being bulletproof.  
Can we get someone to explain all of this further, it is an interesting point of thought.

I'm more concerned about these other organizations, they also hold coins on behalf of their clients.  Anyone able to talk about what sorts of precautions they are doing.
I just don't want to see the same type of drama unfold every 6~12 months.  Maybe I'm a dreamer - and that's just the way it is in this space, even though it is 2016...

Huh?... We're busting his balls because his transaction is too big (at 20 kb no less ).  S-o-w-h-a-t  
The real crime here is, we have to worry about 20 kb as even being "too" big.  
I'm a bit (see what I did there) upset myself.  I gave a friend some coin - and it only took seven hours to get into their wallet.  I looked like an idiot (I used mycelium defaults - med priority).  
Next - trying to fund my 21 computer to run a test; only... yeah - I'm having to wait.

BitGo sounded ok...  I guess I was hoping for something a bit more in-depth and all.  Liked how coinbase did the ama.   Perhaps other companies ought to consider doing these as well.

Solid advice, given expertly :-)  Everyone benefited, me too, from your abilities at explaining the need to constantly recalibrate oneself when working with new technologies - to get the complete benefit/power.  To avoid the pull of just repeating current models.

Actually, what's shocking that (in this day and age) people think that they can so easily still.
The fact that the Blockchain == History is one reason I love this tech so much.  It'll make shutting down this type of nonsense so much easier.

I posted a day or two earlier asking if anyone could comment about the security of gbtc and the other etf's coming up.  More just to open the discussion.  
Got the impression that folks thought I was talking about bitfinex.  That's done and over in my books.  Personally, I love gbtc - but I'm always interested in what others have to say.

Would be helpful if you could TLDR: and drill down to key aspects.
I'm not going to download and read X number of documents, hoping to see the issue(s) you are most concerned about.
PrivateKey is and can be any 'number' - trying to make this simple - that is then used to generate another number one calls an address.  
Would that work?  
@_date: 2016-04-21 02:54:06
Whilst it is easy to say this, the reality is - we've all been there.  I've downloaded a number of apps - in the name of a job/work.  I didn't like it, but did it ... because... job / work.  
As for the domain info not sync'ing/making sense.  Again, I've downloaded stuff from a company's server directly - because their IT required that I did.   All the while, thinking (using my inside voice)  F!
Thankfully, I'm able to have a laptop that I use for work - and only for work.  So nothing personal, nothing of value to me.  I realize though that I'm lucky and not everyone can do this.
Sucks.  I think we all feel for this person.  The folks that ripped this person off are the worst - because they are preying on one of us, using the promise of a job to boot.

A second for ledger.  Love it.
ProTip:  Get the two pack.  Just think, would you feel comfortable with just one key? Probably not.  If you buy these in the dual pack - then they are the same.  Otherwise, you can always get another later and make it the same as the first. 
Also understand that this is a great tool for online use/storage of btc when at a computer.  You can (with an adapter) use it for your android phone - but I find that I like this hardware wallet the best when I'm sitting at my computer.  
@_date: 2016-04-18 03:52:43
Cannot be overstated - the need to encrypt first, before use.
Also, you need to backup every 100 transactions (or sooner), as this particular wallet generates a block of a 100 priv/addr pairs at a time.  So you could find yourself at a loss should something in the future happens and you don't have a recent backup.

@_date: 2015-06-18 17:14:11
Sure - for my opensource projects though, I tend to lean towards github.  It is a platform that many here might feel more at ease interfacing with and contributing via.
As for Google Docs - great choice as well (personal bias); but you got to be careful in the permissioning.  Many folks don't realize that they need to add their changes as "suggesting" (which is not normally defaulted).

It has impacted people - typically those that cannot fight back.  There are many stories of workers, driving while holding their life's savings - only to have their hard earned dollars taken from them.  Try being homeless/near homeless and go get yourself properly 'banked' in the USA, not that easy.  
@_date: 2015-06-18 05:46:48
If it is mainly text, then perhaps github.  That way, folks could make modifications to it in a trackable manner.
If it's more multimedia rich, perhaps sharing on a public google drive (or dropbox) or if really large then perhaps mega.com (50 GB).

@_date: 2014-09-28 04:51:38
Totally agree - but I can't shake the following:
If you accept btc, then you probably know a bit about it already.  Why then even use paypal?  I've seen the old:  Num_Paypay_Users &gt; Num_Btc_Users; therefore, bigger base of potential customers.  
Still though - buyers/sellers of purely digital goods - if there was any group that I'd expect to be able to get bitcoins, it would be this one...

And yet how many do this every day... Why isn't everyone fighting for a way out?
@_date: 2014-07-18 05:22:31
The other day on YouTube, someone had posted about bitcoin 'being hacked' - and I must admit that I wouldn't allow for that to stand.  I wasn't the only one, and at the end of the day - looking back on it all, we put that person down - way down. 
Too down - actually; made him feel like an idiot.  I had helped in turning this person off on crypto entirely and felt terrible.  
So I think that I'm going to be extra careful when interacting with skeptics online - realizing that a lot of communication is nonverbal (absent completely when interacting with someone over the computer.)  They are not the opposition, and in many cases are normal folks that don't really know what's what and they are being feed a load of crap by the corporate news outlets. 
We need to turn these folks on to crypto's and so I'm going to try to be more welcoming and sensitive when engaging online.
@_date: 2014-06-16 05:05:34
I don't know - this might actually work:
The bitcoin -&gt; fiat would result in the price of bitcoin crashing down. If you could do this, such that the majority of the coin is converted before the rest of the market realizes what is happening - then you got das cash.
The resulting crash of the price (providing that you could make it stick for a bit ~72 hrs or so) right up to the point that bids are due, might be enough to freak out the other potential buyers.  Hence them coming in with weaker bids. And let us be honest - there's only a handful of potential buyers (I guessing four - maybe).  You just need to cool these few down, just for a little bit. 
Considering that this auction is (most likely) going to exclude foreign institutional buyers, yet bitcoin is without a nation, I would see that the price would go back to its rightful equilibrium afterwards - a week or so after this somewhat large (American) perturbation.
What's needed (I see the need for the following):
1)  Leadership - someone that the entire community could feel great backing.  Truthfully, I could only see someone like Andreas doing this - i.e. being the face/point person. 
2)  Crack team - filled with folks that can make spreadsheets sign and a logistics mindset second to none.  I'm thinking CPA/CFA/MBA/MS/and hell PhDs that also have a dash of extreme couponing in their DNA - and I mean the early seasons with the excel sheets cross referenced to the n'th degree.  Timing of the conversion of bitcoin to green sheets of paper will be critical to make this work.
3)  Brain dead simple interface to the crowd - probably need partner up with coinbase (not sure if they would be gunning for these coins - my guess is no/due to their prior agreements and not needing them for their biz model).  
4)  Time - oh, can't have that.  So then  ought to be issued an all you can drink caffeinated bev of their choice ASAP.

I don't think anyone's saying this.  Rather, what's being said is to be careful as to how you proceed with an as-yet undefined asset class - one that the IRS themselves don't know how to handle at the moment.  (This will be worked out shortly, I'm sure of that).  With that said, 
Most people ought to not try to do anything "heroic" - as it is not necessary/nor warranted.  Now if you're exclusively being paid wages in bitcoin or handling high volumes - sure.   But chances are, you've got a person doing your taxes already - and they have professional theories as to how to proceed.
But the people that I'm seeing talk about this "problem" are small, and to worry is not needed.  
It's all about levels, just like life...

@_date: 2014-11-30 01:55:10
I'm in the same boat, but I figure it aligns with my passions too greatly not to have. The integration of technology and art. Plus more and more phones are adding NFC, so that's working itself out.  
Also, with apple pay coming online, that's sure to push Google wallet to step up it's game and I think that nfc will grow at a faster pace because of this. 
Besides I love how it feels and looks. I'm not the type to wear jewelry, but this got me to wearing a wedding ring.

Reading these - I cannot help but to see how those student immediately selling their btc will immensely regret that choice later in life.   
It would be interesting if we could have had someone set up a booth in the quad, dressed as the devil - with a sign saying something to the effect of, "sell your bitcoins here".  
With each purchase, perhaps have a devilish laugh played, followed by - "you'll regret this later..."
Hell, make it so that the first X are paid 100 bucks (1:1), with the next Y paid some amount lesser, and so on - perhaps with an ever increase in the volume of the laughter.
Record this "experiment" and show it for bitcoin on the intertubes (so as to keep this project funded and able to continue at other campuses/years...)  
If nothing else, it may make some really think about what they are doing with their bitcoin - if not this go around, then for the next batch of students (and I'm sure others will give out btc in the future.)  
So, do you think that something like this would have made those selling, pause for a moment?

This gives me the chills - from where I'm looking, this looks like elder abuse pure and simple.  
As an adult caretaker myself, it worries me greatly how my grandmother sometimes comes off around strangers.  She says a lot of things that would/could be easily misunderstood.  I believe that this is most likely what has happened in this case - given what I've read about this whole affair. 
If this is what's happened, then I can only hope that this acts to bring to light all the various forms of elder abuse that's out there.  AND, I would hope that a lawyer takes it upon themselves to get this poor man/and his family some restitution for the circus that they will be thrown into. 
Like I said, this piece absolutely gives me the chills - and if you've ever been in charge of an older loved one, you ought to also be scared.   
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:51:53
I think that we're not realizing that print lasts - although the folks hanging around reddit (and elsewhere) were quick to realize the idiocy of this article, there will be many more (orders of magnitude more) that won't.  Namely because they are not online like us, getting their news via these (seemingly - to us at least) backwards channels of the printed (on paper) magazines.  
I cannot tell you how many of my students told me about how the creator of bitcoin was found, and didn't really believe me when I explained that is not likely at all.  So I hope it does die out quickly, I think that it'll linger for this man and his family for some time though.

Really.  
You didn't pitch-in to this endeavor (one that adds to and promotes this incredible technology to a wider audience) because you felt slighted due to non-payment for potential services rendered.  Whoa - ok...
I guess I don't go to bed holding my copy of Atlas Shrugged under the sheets, so this way of thinking seems to be a bit extreme.
Second - it is an O'Reilly book, they make beautiful books that are geared to the widest possible audience.  The individual wanting to pound out code at 3 in the morning is not their target demographic, as that person ain't going to buy a  copy (they are probably on github or a forum or in an IDE - i.e. doing.)  
This is a great book, that gives bitcoin (and blockchain technology) a huge stamp of legitimacy to the public at large.  Believe or not (and I'm in Silicon Valley nonetheless), but the majority of people that I run into and talk to about this technology, will equate bitcoin to drugs, murder, (fill in Bad Stuff here)... 
Not a radical paradigm shift (and I hate using that phrase due to overuse, though it does fit here) in how we are able to communicate value and information between one another.  Now when Joe/Jane Public goes into Barnes and Noble, they will see Mastering Bitcoin next to the latest Rachael Ray Book and think to themselves - hum... perhaps this bitcoin isn't too bad, it is right next to Rachael's smiling self.

This would be a bit of work (mixing and matching/dev'ing the bootstrapping needed to get this to "work") and wouldn't be turnkey for many.  
I was thinking if you feel that it is possible to have true(ish) randomness through an easy physical device (such as a usb power-up SRAM state stick of sorts) - you would be able to remove some human error.  I feel that for choices a-f (excluding d), you have to assume that the human does not do something silly (like point the camera at a photo.)  And I realize that there will always be noise in any given sensor but that requires that the sensor/software have the ability/resolution to detect.  Whereas something like 'd' is what I'm thinking of.
It does make me wonder why such a device is not commercially available from different vendors, but all with a standardized output that can then be used by various softwares.   So the end user could plug in two or N of these devices from different sources/different exact sensors that would act to seed/generate the random number.

This is fail on so many levels (many that have already been talked about here).  I see this unfolding in one of two ways (actually more - but..)
1)  This is great for bitcoin, as folks there get accustomed to the notion of electronic payment systems that work internationally (and beyond).  Then learn more about what makes for a GREAT system - thereby finding (in time) bitcoin and the rest of us.  
Making such a system/environment was not (is not) trivial - otherwise, we would have figured it out sooner.  
or - 
2)  This completely turns people off these types of systems, as they see all electronic payment endeavors (including bitcoin) as a insane person's desire/attempt of COPY-PASTE (repeat forever) - presto - Money made. 
This makes no sense - what type of individual would accept such a "thing"?  I cannot see a vendor Ecuador emailing their supplier in Germany and seriously believing that these folks would accept such a payment.  I guess if you are forced to accept it - that's another matter entirely.  However, that assumes that everything you and everyone else needs is located within this artificially induced economic bubble.  
This is only going to grind these people's abilities at producing/creating down to a halt.  Terrible.

I'm a bit upset at the FUD being said in the posts to the video. I really enjoy listening to Mike Maloney, so when I scroll down and see people posting crap (such as "bitcoin has been hacked") I don't even know what to say.

I've effectively removed myself from mainstream media (as I'm sure many others here have.)  And when these stories come out, I'm inclined to roll my eyes and think that nobody out there would believe this crap.
HOWEVER, I then go on a vacation and get a chance to see the news on the cable networks - the absolute crap that passes for the 'news' is unbelievable. (I recalibrate every now and then.)  The fact is, I feel badly for those individuals out there that just don't know how to get information from other sources (read - use the Internet and proper searches) and read something like "time" to better themselves.  
The best way to overcome this nonsense, is to make sure that we all try our best at helping friends/family that may not be as computer literate as we are, to use this wondrous tool.  I wouldn't start off with something like btc, maybe show them how to research (buy on Ebay/whatever) their hobby - something.  Making people feel more confident researching online is the surest way to get them off the toxic teat that is mainstream media.  
Because I for one am super tired at this FUD directed at my interests.

Note: learn how to properly back up.  
For example Im a apple fanboy (though its becoming harder and harder) and backed up to icloud and my Mac. So when I got the iPhone 5 to replace my ageing iPhone 4 I did a normal restore.  Lost all my tfa as I would later learn my backups needed to be encrypted if I wanted this transfered to my new iPhone.  
I'm sure its the same for Android. That'll make restoring from a lost phone possible.

"A hacker accessed (...)" - aka - some dude that knew how to open a text file and use a browser (maybe).
I'm seriously tired of the term "hacker" being misused.  In the early days, I would bitch and moan when this word was used to describe the script kiddies - but jesus-h-christ - it's really gotten outta control.

True, first I was thinking if there were a mechanism in which perhaps you could have two of these from different companies.  But what if it were open hardware, I realize that it would require trust at the component level - which may or may not be smart. 
I'm always thinking that making a task easier for more people and eliminating potential error vectors.  Such as, what if the person moves the mouse the same way every time - etc.

Decided to get this as a test.  But the buying experience was the best part for me.  
The ease with which I was able to fill in my 411, the QR code with everything ready for me to review on my personal wallet (in my hands), and seeing an invoice automatically download to my computer...
This is why I love cryptocurrencies.  It just flows for how I live.  Doing this with a CC is infinitely more painful - hence why I use lastpass/etc to help make the process go faster.  Whereas with cryptos, no need - it just works, and works exactly the way it ought to be for me.

Anyway of trying to convince CurrentC to use bitcoin as the underlying framework?...  Seems like the front end they are proposing could be powered by bitcoin very easily. 
They could also ride the whole 'bitcoin community news PR machine' - otherwise they are going to have a hard time not appearing like "me too's" or "late to the game noobs"...  
And as for the retailers locking out Apple and Google - if CurrentC doesn't make it as a payment processor, then there will be hell to pay further down the road.  I can't imagine that Apple and Google will forget/forgive them easily.  I'd be hitching up to bitcoin in a hurry.

Use Coinbase as intended:
1) buy btc
2) move btc into YOUR wallet
3) there is no three.  
Then the idea/need of auditing is greatly assuaged.  Until tools like multi Sig can be implemented Easily, you gotta move your btc. Hopefully soon people will be able to have Coinbase hold their bitcoin - bit I'd still tell these folks that the whole idea of breaking paradigms is to, well break paradigms.

Might I suggest:
Unplug the HD and then boot off of a live usb linux distribution.  Within linux (ubuntu is great for this):  download software, make sure that you can use your printer (may need to install drivers), issue the sha1sum within the terminal to verify SW, unplug the ethernet cord/WiFi.
Windows is just too - well, it is windows.  It sort of seems to me that every sad story begins with, "on my windows system...".
Plus - there are a ton more tutorials for creating paper wallets/etc on youtube within a linux environment.  
If you are creating paper wallets, might I recommend grabbing some acid free paper as well as printing more than one copy (so you can put a copy offsite - just in case).  Lastly, I would also copy the Public Keys generated onto a clean usb - for ease of use - wouldn't worry too much about this.  Maybe (on an encrypted - separate usb stick) copy the Pub/Priv keys, but only on a highly secured usb stick.   Truecrypt 7.1a is probably safe for this task - even though...

This may seem all fun and games for us (i.e. those that are a bit more tech savvy than the majority of folks that will be reading this in print); however, this will be far from 'fun' for this poor man and his family.
As an adult caretaker of an elderly loved one, this piece absolutely scares me.  My grandmother says a number of things that would be easily misunderstood by a passerby.  I have always believed that a reasonable person would understand and take these ramblings with a large gain of salt.  This has proven to me that this is not the case and I have been right to be extremely careful when we are out and about in public.  
Nonetheless, this just points to the need to meaningfully address elder abuse (it takes many forms.)  From what I've read/seen, I truly believe that elder abuse has happened and this man/his family will be pulled through the mud (starting with tonight's news at 6 up until the late night shows) and most likely for the rest of the week.  Then it'll (hopefully) be realized that he's not the man - but I wouldn't count on that making nearly the big splash we're seeing now.

Most westerns (myself included) do not have direct experience with current systems used to send money home/around.  However, these are horrid industries that prey on the hard working folks that must send money home (that much I think we all can agree with). And I know that one day, I too will need to send money - as I have a family member that is unable to care for themself.  
So how does one send money to a loved one, in a responsible manner?  Bank account? Not realistic.  So small lumps sums... But how can one send dollars of such a size as to minimize the potential for abuse and perhaps are earmarked for things like food, rent, fun, etc?  Can I set this up to work even if I'm (the input node) is no longer active?  Right now - no / I mean there are legal instruments - but cost prohibitive.  
Bitcoin offers a new way.  Small payments:  Check.  Earmarked: Coming soon.  Automated:  Coming soon.
Everyone would like to have a life that goes as planned, as well as the lives of those that they are responsible for - also go as planned. That doesn't always happen due to fate/chance/life itself.  So we have to have a backup.  Humans and systems run by humans - don't have a great track record in my book.  
Well-defined, algorithm based systems do have a great track record.  Systems, ones that I know and understand their operating environment(s) are infinity more useful to me.  I would trust my life to a well created computer/robot/etc over the human analog any day of the week - as would most.  
Afterall, the last time I was in the hospital - the ventilators were being controlled by machines, not humans.  Indeed, the thought of a person standing above me with the sole job of squeezing a bag of life giving air makes me uneasy.  But I'm suppose to believe that a person whose sole job is moving my money from account 1 to account 2 ought not to make be uneasy?

When I look back at what I had to do in order to check my email back in the day - from issuing commands to my modem to connect to my local server (via a telephone line running at a blazing 1200 baud), then telneting over to the computer that was the actual mail server to then kermit'ing (later xmodem and such) any and all files that were sent to me (only to realize that I forgot the binary option - so start over)...  I never once thought that it was too much.
Why?  Because I was communicating with people from all over the world.  How cool was that?  
When you realize the power and potential behind blockchain technology that is beginning to emerge - how cool is that.  So while the process is (admittedly) convoluted at the moment - although it is giving people for the first time in their lives a reason to understand computer security/not theater - we nevertheless are making rapid progress on this front.  It will be turnkey sooner than email was (timeline'wise).
Besides, we live in a time of wondrous tools.  Tools that I could not have imagined in my youth.  The average person can learn all of this, sure they need to pry themselves away from the boob-tube and hit up a tutorial on youtube.

Here's some ideas: (bitaddress and usb printer)
Why not download bitaddress.org. You can hash the download, as a double check (PM if needed a how to). 
Setup a printer and grab some acid free paper (and pencil for good measure).  After getting the rPi setup just the way that you like (and getting it printing can be tricky - trust me) - clone that SD Card.  That way, you have a clean start state for the future.  
Then disconnect the rPi from the internet and connect your printer up to the rPi's usb port - running bitaddress locally.  Print as many wallets as you want, however you want.  Labeling them with your pencil. 
After you are done with the card - why not throw it into a digital camera/camcorder and format it.  Then securely format the now somewhat formated SD Card on another computer.  Preferably another air gapped computer (maybe running linux - best way to be sure) - but truthfully, SD Cards are cheap enough.  A four pack of 4GB is ridiculously low now...
OH - I nearly forgot:  (and some folks might disagree with this, but...)
Have a couple of USB sticks around:  In a text file you start on the rPi, save the PUBLIC keys ONLY - this will greatly help when you wish to use them.  You can just copy/paste.  This isn't the dangerous part, and I think you can see the value in doing this.
In the other usb stick, make a text file with the PUBLIC/PRIVATE keys.  Now, be sure to take necessary care.  You can encrypt it, whatever.  If you needed to rapidly access your funds, being able to again copy/paste would be helpful.  BUT IT IS DANGEROUS.  Please be extra careful.  Truecrypt or otherwise lock it down (and yah, I know about truecrypt - but still...)
I like the 321 method of backing up:  3 backups, 2 different media, 1 offsite.  This is a means of doing this:  paper + usb (but be careful). 
@_date: 2014-07-20 05:32:03

You're basically bringing up the whole - tragedy of the commons... And I think that the fact that the majority failed to act like adults, damns them more as a generation. 
An adult recognizes the long term trends of various group actions, considers whether or not said trajectory is acceptable; and if it is not, comes together to enact changes through policy/law.  Basically - You change the environment.
Other countries have been able to do this, though reading the comments looks like Europe is trying to go down our shitty road.  But I see the erosion of taxation a direct reflection on a society that doesn't want to admit that we are all in it together.  And the boomers were the ones that really got hot and heavy into the - screw taxes, who needs it (conveniently, forgetting that their generation was the most subsidized generation of all time.)

And again, the folks over at NFC ring are genuine great people.  People that you probably can relate to in a heart beat.  People that you wouldn't mind crashing on your couch or having a beer with.  People that think like us and are making cool stuff for them/us.

@_date: 2014-05-02 19:54:15
So the metric system (and sci notation) are not future-proof?  
I don't know, what happens when a "bit" is deemed too great of a unit - do those in the future say - "hey, let's use 1,000,000 b's = 1 bit...."
Whenever one goes too far from scientifically useful formats, i.e. logically arrived at units of measure, you run the risks of screwing over the future you.  
The world uses the metric system, so mBitcoin, uBitcoin, etc are well understood.  Perhaps we could begin outreach to teach the world more about using/working with scientific notation.  
But besides the above - this isn't a real problem.  All of this concern is not useful in the short term (next 5~10 yrs) as most adopters coming into the bitcoin world will think of this instrument in terms of their local fiat.  Once we get to the point of needing to 'solve' this problem - well, it won't be a problem...

What about selling a picture of a cat over the intertubes - internationally?
But seriously, banks continue to demonstrate how they do not want retail clients by new fees and new ways to deny what were basic services in my youth. Coupled with zero interest rates (or perhaps negative ones in the near future) banks make less and less sense. Enter this technology. 
It is hard, now.  Not really (or so I think), but starting with this - what have we've  seen?  Rapid progress on many fronts with regard to various facets of the tech's implementation. Software, hardware and new businesses that are making this new tech more and more accessible to an ever widening audience. 
I really do believe that it is important because it is logical (just read any good sci-fi), though I see so many that resist out of fear.  Just as I have seen with email years ago. Seeing a letter sent across country, one dorm room to another blew my mind. Yet years afterwards I couldn't sell the importance of email to many of my loved ones. And now it is bittersweet when I send them an email and their address contains their name with an ending number.

google my friend, I didn't even try to have a great search... Also, there are more recent ones.
Actually, I just realized that I answered the second part of your reply...
here's something to address your first statement regarding homelessness and banking:
I thought that I'd have an uplifting story - while still demonstrating the plight that homeless have wrt banking - towards the end of the article. (Note:  I did not have in mind the idea of homeless folks having problems carrying around 10k+, simply the difficultly in these folks getting banked.)
But the real problem, and as a college chemistry professor I see this each new semester, if something hasn't or doesn't DIRECTLY affect a person - then it isn't something that people will care enough to address/or even question.  I always thought it was just something that fellow scientists' (during my time in industry and then government) did to one another, i.e.:
Not standing up to help one another in the face of an oppressive/unfair system - siding against the individual that has been wrong - going so far as to question the abilities of the one being harmed (they should have known better than...). 
Then I discovered critical race theory, and see that there is a great (and expanding) body of work into this phenomena.  Still, I just wish people could put themselves in another person's shoes and work towards a more just system - just because.  
That's why I'm cheering on bitcoin - I might not trust my fellow human not to screw me over, but I completely trust a mathematical formula that hasn't had the "screw individuals" sub-routine built into its algorithm.  
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:25:25
I don't think that this is going to be the case.
Firstly, it seems to me that banks pretty much hate the retail market - e.g. close to zero interest rates on personal accounts, fees that would make a citizen/consumer from the 70/80/90s grab a pick axe, and (I forget how many decades now) of stagflation/McJobs/etc that have reduced individuals earnings that they are able to hold on to....
So I'd highly discount the role/voice of individual consumers.  Banks serve big money sinks - big money has a funny way of always getting paid.  And they have no incentive to change anything, as they are thriving under the current system.  
While I agree in principle with your logic, I suspect banks will not open up.  Current levels of transparency (none basically for serfs like us) will remain as they are.  If a bank does require a bailout, then they will steal whatever meager holdings individuals were forced to have them hold first - then (because it won't be enough) have their hands held out for a taxpayer pay day.  
@_date: 2014-11-24 06:26:58
I agree with this, at the moment.  But as more and more folks find themselves as independent contractors or freelancers, a growing trend, then the failures in cc will become more pronounced and directly connected to their families livelihood.

This advice is always the best - investing in oneself.  
To add, right now it is impossible to "invest" in the normal sense for two reasons.  Any great startup is either going alone or in a prof incubator (ie walled off for the most part).  Second, without a solid understanding of the tech it is just too difficult to separate those that have impossible claims with those that potentially can succeed.  Everything is still up in the air.  
Hat last bit is so awesome, because it means everything is still up in the air and possible.  So learn to code for this technology and create your awesome solution.

A bit twisted sure - again, I think that the people 'worrying' about this problem - are the people that don't need to worry about this problem.  
If you truly need to be concerned, then you already have a person thinking about professional theories of how best to proceed.  The vast majority of people 'worrying' about this problem, need to invest that energy elsewhere.  That's really how I've been reading the OP and subsequent comments.
As for honesty Vs. doing as you're told - I think you'll come to realize that for any sufficiently complex system, you should always do what is asked of you.  And to go the extra mile, typically is a bad move as you will only frustrate said system.  You can definitely put in a word (to get a clear/clean state of mind), but at the end of the day - do what's being asked and keep the amount of boy scout'ing to a min.

Love the idea that multiple agents drawn from a pool of potential volunteers get to weigh in and vote towards a consensus.  That aspect (if implemented correctly) is super powerful - and not just here, but anywhere you want to 'enforce' a smart contract in the physical world.

Best way (from my experience) to get max exposure to the ever shrinking middle class in America - have NPR do a story/series on the topic. 
I cannot tell you how many times I've wasted my breath talking this over to friends/colleagues, to only have them "educate" me on the exact same topic one year later because of NPR.  
So I firmly believe that one's actions would be best spent trying to have this organization produce a piece, explaining this topic.

Although google translate is incredible - I've learned that it pays to wait and have a speaker (with a good understanding of the necessary context/subcontext) to provide a reasonable analysis. 
So although this makes perfect sense in my worldview/understanding, I've come to realize that logic doesn't always win out. 
Is there anyone here that can translate/give their analysis of this article?  What about folks living there  (i.e. boots on the ground) - what is it like really over there?  
One would think that given a western embargo (basically) against you, one would be thinking about how best to continue biz as usual.  Re-inventing and then selling everyone on "your" brand new payment network seems a bit much.  But I've been in enough meetings in my life to have seen plently of knucklehead "leaders" believing that the worst ideas are perfectly do'able with enough powerpoints.  So who knows what their leadership is going to do...

The whole - "I'm going to have a kid at 30" - is what a responsible person would do. Baby boomers (looking at the sample population that I've been exposed to), did not do this as a whole.  
I'm 40, and the vast majority of the people I know is also around 40 - with their folks being squarely inside the baby boomer generation.  Having a kid at 20 was considered "normal" for some time.  
I am glad that this is slowly changing - sounds like you have only been surrounded by intelligent and sensible people - you should feel lucky.  I envy you.

Interesting. One thing that needs to be cleaned up (in the USA at least), many cities and towns have laws requiring cash to be carried on public sidewalks.  The idea behind these laws is to allow cops a reason to have their way for undesirables, who may not be carrying money. 
Saw this many times growing up in the south.  Fortunately directed only at teens (I was a teen at the time but realized immediately how this could be applied otherwise) - and no, having a debit/credit card did not count.

He's going to be pulled through the meat grinder for a long while.  
I can't tell you how many of my college students talked about how "they found the guy behind bitcoin" today to me (they know I'm into it).  So I can only imagine that the vast majority of folks are thinking this all across America (and beyond).

I'm really hoping that they just do not understand what they pulled for this article or that this was a genuine mistake (or maybe there is some reason that would properly explain everything to us).  
Using any derogatory/hateful images really does not advance the work/efforts that folks in cryptocurrencies are attempting to perform.  These men and women are trying to create a system that benefits all humankind, by rejecting a system built on injustice and inequity. (getting down from my soapbox now...)

I would probably say that the dictionary that you are using is a bit subpar.
But forget about that - how "hacker" was used (and how that particular word is generally understood) conjures up thoughts of a highly trained individual.  Essentially, someone that put effort into their trade/skill.  
So if I'm going to the second floor, using the escalator, of a mall and happen to find a twenty in the crack - calling myself a "cat burglar" would probably upset actual cat burglars (if they were to find out.)  
My definition of the word "hacker" - in this particular context would probably come to mean someone that would recognize the name Dan Farmer (or a photo from his original website) and/or break into a UNIX (or Linux) account (of a reasonably intelligent person) - if so, then I'll pin the gold star myself on their forehead.  Whereas:
Cracking into a Wintel box of any kind - meh, finding a file by combing the "deep web" (i.e. knowing a bit about boolean operators and how to use them in a google search) - meh^2, etc... 
I'm just advocating standards (and I realize the old joke about there being so many to pick from) - but this is my personal pet peeve.  (And I'm giving you an upvote for putting up with this craziness)

"Who's going to buy me a free lunch" - man, that was it for me.  He was one of ours...even if he didn't realize it himself at the time.  
And seeing one of our own being thrown under the bus like he was, well - that was too much and I knew that I had to help, anyway that I could.  So when the fund was established, it was a no-brainer.  
Why people in the mass media are not talking about the ability to have such a type of fundraiser as this was:  i.e. the sending of dollar(s) through the Internet so easily/cheaply - to help a specific person/cause is beyond me.  They (as a whole) would rather re-hash that B/S story about him maybe/maybe not being being the creator.  Well, I guess we do know why substantive reporting isn't practiced so much today - as it may result in people actually thinking.

@_date: 2017-02-12 16:49:38
Hard to say - forgetting the issues around btc either hitting the moon - or - zero.  The question comes down to communicating these (as intended).  Again, assuming that your intent is properly communicated - how would you encode the idea...
There's hardware/paper/etc wallets.  Physical wallets require physical control - which is (still) a real issue for many (particularly since your kid's 2).  
Next, access control - sure you can BIP-38 them - but then there's the question of communicating this information.  Or SSSS.  Or MultiSig...
These other ideas could also be used to ensure that your intent is executed the way that you wanted.  
Realistically - take your time.  Write it down on paper, think, re-formulate.  The great thing about this tech is the number of choices.  I would probably assume that any one path will be compromised in the future - so why not split this into 210 different paths.  Some paper wallets, w and w/o BIP38, a hardware wallet, some multiSig, some using SSSS, ... you get the idea.  And if  you are comfortable 'rolling your own' transactions - CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY  some of these coins.  
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:08:05
Thanks. That does help. :-).

That is interesting - perhaps this noise was just too local (i.e. just state side) to affect bitcoin.
Anyone outside of America hear about this today in your daily comings and goings?  I mean, I got non-tech folks today talking about this story to me - so it was a big splash.
But maybe it (thankfully) wasn't picked up by news outlets in other countries. Or maybe those actually in bitcoin recognized how crappy this 'story' was immediately and tuned it out.

Actually sometimes you lose 100% of the value - I have had experience with gift cards from now bankrupt companies, gift cards from places that I never shop at, or even lost physical cards (hence - lost real money.)  
So 10% volatility doesn't look all that bad at all - and when you consider that I can send that value around the world at the speed of light to anywhere I wish, looks pretty decent. 
In fact I've bought a book, a physical coin, makeup, and other physical items from different stores using the same magical internet money (and that's just this past month).   Things are looking great if you ask me.

@_date: 2014-12-26 07:02:42
Can't understand the complaints about the book - 
Firstly, The book was on GITHUB prior to actually being publishing.  Everyone saying it has mistakes - you could have pointed these out prior to it being actually published. 
Each and every human endeavor can be made more perfect.  So I really don't see how you can fault someone trying to push the ball forward - cause it wasn't a perfect push.  
Secondly, he's out pounding the pavement and making bitcoin more legitimate to everyday folks with each breath he takes (even I realize how that sounded like, but I'm tired).  And even he says to challenge him, and if you have something better to say - say it and kick him outta there.  Except, no one else has risen to the occasion.
And - if you bought this book to immediately dev using the blockchain, who are you trying to kid?  Anyone programming for this technology would never do this.  That's like claiming scientists use textbooks to perform research.  Nope (that is not how it works) - you go see what your peers are doing in the journals (i.e. github/forums for your language and/or project - up to the minute info).  
Textbooks and this book, I would argue is to get conversations started that might not normally begin. Also, it shines a huge bright light of legitimacy, one that wasn't there - because it is a physical book.  Again - anyone in this subreddit and reading this - doesn't need any of this, but we are not (yet) the norm in our society.  He's trying though to make this so.
In the meantime, we ought to have his back.  He is one of us and being highly effective at doing what he does.  I read the book on github (and ordered my copy) - I can't wait to get my copy and more for friends/family.

From a logical standpoint - why in the world wouldn't you go the other route?  Still, people are willing to go down this crazy pathway.  I'm hoping that the ease of bitcoin (easier wallets and online stores) coupled with more people feeling ok using a smartphone to buy stuff (i.e. gyft/ApplePay/etc) will push people into considering to use bitcoin.  
I guess we gotta go through the AOL phase until enough people realize that the "free" alternative (the Internet) is where all of the action is at.  For us it'll be these locked down systems until people realize this wonderful invention called bitcoin and the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:16:49
Really is a personal choice. Having someone else hold your assets introduces an addition potential failure point.  What if they run off with your money / they go bankrupt / etc.
The great thing about bitcoin, the individual has the power to have complete control of his/her assets.  There is no need for a trusted third party that may or may not make a mistake.  That does assume that you don't make a mistake either. 
If you're not going to touch these funds for a long time, feel that you can control/store easily paper for a length of time, and interested in learning new stuff - then move a portion over to a paper wallet.  There are a number of tutorials out there. 
Or perhaps move your funds into a hardware wallet.  A device designed to hold you bitcoins that you have complete control over.  You just need to secure the device, and maintain the seed it'll generate for you - just in case the device were to ever die.
If you think that the online service provider is good, and they are in great shape financially - not on the verge of bankruptcy - maybe stay put.  
I would suggest you revisit any choice you make regularly though.  And the time window isn't human time but rather use dog time.  What I mean is, one bitcoin year is more like seven dog years - i.e.:  it is highly accelerated.

1994 study of Americans would most likely conclude that they wouldn't use the internet.  (Hell) I think that many folks here also recall the "good old days" of having to explain that personal computers would be the future. Etc.

Admittedly the piece is centered around the human element... Sure, one could nitpick about the sentence "(...) Bitcoin code is based on a network protocol that's been established for decades" - I assume they are talking about TCP/IP? And no real mention of the blockchain - which by the way, is the meat and potatoes that makes bitcoin - work.  And more nuggets within the article itself - but why bother as ...
If this person had a working familiarity/understanding of the technology behind bitcoin - it would have been immediately apparent that they were wildly off as their story was unfolding. Instead, they doubled down.  
Because this 'reporter' would have learned that many folks have tried to determine the real identity of Nakamoto.  Many of these are truly experts - spanning the entire range of computer sciences.  These same CS folks have, in a number of cases, documented their efforts and presenting their evidence for others to review/expand upon.  And the jury's still out.
Yet this 'reporter' was able to figure it all using a model train website(?) and basically hearsay (I think this is the correct word I'm looking for) as proof/evidence to support the claims made in the article?  That's where I'm coming from, that's why I'm mad - sloppy work makes me upset.

Ok.  There's a lot here around the idea of avoiding totalitarianism.  I can respect that, completely understand it even.  I've never really liked authority figures myself.
With that said - it seems that UASF/SegWit/etc are coming out of a single corporation:  Blockstream (BS).  I think that they have done great work, hope they still contribute in the future.  However, we're basically being asked to do what they say is best ... or ... else.
Remember, I don't like authority figures - so I'm put off immediately when somebody tells me they know best for me.  Show don't tell.  And from what I've seen:  a &lt;2x increase in transactions &lt;== and that's assuming everyone does SegWit. And the amount of tech debt necessary for such a small bump.  That for me was the - no thanks, Next.

I would say that it is easier.  Easier to secure, store, and transmit - for the moment.  
With a properly crafted paper wallet, with encryption, you are free to move that wallet offsite (perhaps into the hands of trusted individuals - individuals that you want to handle your affairs in the event of your death/etc.)  You can convey your final intent in a more user friendly device in paper.
Or just offsite, you never know what might happen one night - fire, flooding, etc.
Also having them creates logical chunks - you can fund them with smaller/more manageable amounts.  Then when you need X btc - you grab only the number you need.  Like a Hersey's bar.  
Because all forms of information suffer from eventual degradation through time - that is a fact. So having different forms, with different decay functions is a hedge against loss.  
Hope that helps - and I too like the rPi solution personally.  I can't tell you how long I looked at mine (got it because everyone had one sort of thing) - it was that moment of frustration in wanting to make wallets:  If only I had a cheap/quick computer ---&gt; Oh yeah, I have that rPi.  There are some hiccups though, and please know that you can ask if you need the work arounds.

Sure - but on my iPhone that day so I was using Jaxx.  I was in the office of a person, demonstrating the tech's ease with which money moved - the prime goal being showcasing Bitcoin as a payment solution.  
It was only after I went to my office, did I notice the cost.  I was more concerned about the length of time that it took to get into her wallet.  
Obviously the algo that Jaxx uses to compute fee is ... non-ideal?  But I'm sure it is grounded in its understanding of current block expenses.

Agreed.  Again, I wasn't paying attention and probably wouldn't have happened had I been using mycelium.  However, I didn't have my android phone on me at the time.  
I still believe that for this tech to 'win' and to grow, it will need more people.  More people are not going to onboard to yet another settlement network - particularly as there are so many great ones already out there (their bank, paypal, wepay, venmo, ...).
People do understand 'cash' and the abilities to transact peer to peer.  That's the vector into more people's minds - that of permissionless cash.  Then comes the technology that you can build atop (the real wealth / value).

So, you agree with UASF (or as I referred to as:  USAF)? You are not worried about the potential for Sybil attacks? 
As for my calling it "USA"F - I do so as (personal opinion follows) a lot of folks (in the USA) seem to be drawn towards UASF out of a malice or fear of "Chinese" miners.  And they love to talk about miners' location/nationality for some reason.  
For me personally, I would like to see humanity move ahead of traditional constructs - particularly those that box people into Us/Them's.  Bitcoin made me believe that we could maybe work towards a common currency and hence a common humanity. I'm probably an idiot for a lot of things, but on this - I hope that I'm not.

A lot do give you those options, it's just that in the case - Jaxx's UI is a bit difficult to reach.  Had I been using my Android phone, I probably would have used mycelium and there the options are easier to select. 
The fact that this even happened, would turn a great number of potential users off.  Thankfully, the person that I sent the money over - did not pick up on this.  They would have (rightfully) laughed this out of their door.  
My biggest concern is that we as a community need to be building up user numbers, and that means being mindful of the entire user experience at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:50:08
To be honest.  I was using Jaxx and wasn't looking as closely as I should have. But, still - this probably shouldn't have happened. And would turn off many.  I realized only afterwards, when using mycelium ( I've got a couple the same privkey on a variety of wallet softwares. ). 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:02:07
Huh? I'm confused. You mention a concern around mining power in a "totalitarian country" (your words) and by a single company.  
I respected that position, and then stated my position - also against 'totalitarianism'.  
Except, mine is centered against the idea of a single company pushing their tools that influence how the network functions at the most basic levels. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:24:24
And this 'false narrative' is?...
I'm totally against changing the PoW algo.  Because:
1)  Miner centralization was a problem, particularly years ago - but has (opinion) solved itself of late.  I even included a link with evidence of support.
2) Nodes were never given 'voting' or signaling or whatever you want to call it rights - due to the potential of Sybil attacks.  
3) Miners generate value by burning energy to create security.
4) See UASF ( aka - for me at least -  USAf ) as being wrapped in highly nationalistic packaging from supporters - and totally against that as well.
I would like to know my 'false' narrative, If I've been unclear - it'll help me be clearer in the future.

No you haven't.  Sorry. Not go'ing to sugar coat it for you.
As for...
Straw man?  OP is about a change of PoW - I'm against it.  Again, the reasons given in the article center around miner centralization - actually, it's the first sentence.  I came out saying that this is not really a problem (of late) and provided evidence.  Mining has become more decentralized in the past year than at any other time in recent history. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:04:32
First sentence and I only see a contrived narrative. I'm not trying to flame on:
Miner centralization?  
I'd be the first to worry about miner centralization, and did years ago both here and in the litecoin forums.  However, if you believe in Nakamoto consensus then you cannot change the PoW algo to sanction malicious miners - whatever that means.   
There's just so much weirdness of late.  
1)  Nodes were never considered as contributing to any 'vote' due to the potential of Sybil attacks, and now they are with USAF? &lt;- believe me, that's what it looks like at the moment.
2)  Bitcoin's value is in the conversion of energy into proof of work, i.e. Hashing power - and now it isn't? 
3)  Dynamic blocksize BIPs were laughed out, due to them being overly complex - and yet this "Proposal" is ok?  Having X number of PoW algos, that are dynamically adjusting - forgetting about that complexity, wouldn't that explode the bandwidth needed for all the nodes to know which block with what PoW is the correct one?  
Seems like a step backwards, and benefits only those that can afford custom hardware for those X number of Algos.  And the necessary bandwidth to communicate all this additional information.
Thereby resulting in mining centralization to a point we've not seen - ever.  After all, you would need to be able to buy, setup, run however many custom systems to compete?  Don't think for a second that this would be democratizing mining for a minute.  
Farms would emerge, overnight (they might be smaller).  And your ASIC in your living room would be making "Y" value/"X" Algos.  Basically killing off pools. 
But these farms would be smaller - i.e. Less computational power protecting the state of the ledger and hence the whole concept of a 'single source of shared truth'.

Calling bs... yesterday, I spent over 2usd to send a friend 5usd. I was demonstrating how the tech worked.  Thankfully they didn't realize how much I spent, they only thought it took a while to get their money.  The payments aspect of this tech is broken.  Which is scary.  
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:10:55
Trezor is secure; however, I would argue that Ledger just as much.  In both cases, it really is a function of the end user and ensuring that they deploy all available mechanisms properly.   
Having a cheaper solution can be better, as you are more likely to experiment with and play around with - to get to know what your device is capable of doing.  
Both companies are solid - and the tools that are coming out for both (beyond just storing coins) is getting more and more useful (e.g.: ID and the like.) 
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:56:30
Well, you could use a rPi as your air gapped computer.  Getting it configured for the various cryptos, printing, etc.  Print your cold storage with the following ideas in mind:
1)  The memory on these limit the total number of wallets that can be generated at one time (artwork off).  If you put in too high of a number, then the system crashes.
2)  Getting your printer to work the first time can be tricky.
3)  Print either MultiSig or BIP38 wallets. You don't want to have rethink this down the line.  So think about it now.
4)  Print three (3) copies.  Physically locate these at different places (hence   You cannot 100% insure that they will not be lost.  Also, consider printing on acid free paper (and write on these in pencil as to min chemical reactivity)
5)  Have a USB stick at the ready during this process.  You can save the Public Addresses (not PrivK's) onto it.  This way it is easier for you to import these into your 'real' computer to monitor.
5b)  If you are really feeling adventurous, then you can install veracrypt on a stick and save both the Addr/Private Keys.  But this will need a LOT-o-care, to make certain that you don't accidently do anything dumb with this.
Print a lot, then consider taking the SD card out and burning it/destroying it.  Unless you really want to have your own Piper - but I just don't see why. 
I think that  is a good compromise overall.  You get true paper wallets (cold storage) using an air gapped computer that came into existence for this one job and then 'destroyed'.  Yet you have a sane electronic copy for yourself as well.  
This is also a great use for a YubiKey - You can configure it as to make it easy to have really hard passphrases.  Just get two at a time - think car keys.  You would never drive around knowing that you only have one key to you car.  
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:58:01
OP's problem is that the 'cashing' out into bitcoin - ain't bitcoin, rather to snapcard.  
I think the real question is for the community - anyone remember the signup process for snapcard and specifically what ID is needed.  
In a lot of these services have different levels of ID required.  For example, you can buy small amounts and only provide a name and phone number, things like SSN being required for larger amounts...etc
In the meantime OP - download a wallet (really depends on your platform of choice:  iPhone, Android, Wintel, Linux, etc).  That way you are ready, if a mechanism is found.  Personally - I like Mycelium for my Android and Breadwallet for my iPhone.  Longer term, look into paper wallets.  But for small/spendable amounts - these would be fine.  
Sorry about this...
@_date: 2016-06-12 19:33:04
If you don't want to spend a lot.  Just get the "Duo" - in case you lose the one, you don't want to be sitting on your hands.  Check out purse.io to buy and get it even cheaper.
This is a great cold/hot wallet - I think this falls in the middle'ish.
Bitaddress.org is cold - and better if you just want to store for the long haul.
Trezor is solid - but again a bit pricey.  
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:50:35
Well, that isn't necessary correct either (...hundred million years).  Should we create a working (production quality) quantum computer, then one can compute the privKey from the PubKey on the Blockchain.  This will probably come about in the next ten~twenty years (depends on who you ask - I think sooner'ish myself.)
This is why we now have P2PKH - so that this problem isn't a problem.  But you were talking about sha256 and not breaking EC.

Just make sure to use an air gapped computer.  Honestly, a raspberry pi that has been setup to print (via cups) is (my opinion) the best solution.  Download all the software (basically the website), check your downloads (hashes are what they should be).  
Then remove WiFi / ethernet access to your computer. On the new Raspberry pi 3's - gotta disable the built-in WiFi (and I'd turn off my router just to be on the safe side).
Make a ton of paper wallets, then print everything in threes (or twos) - just in case one copy is ruined. I've found that ~40 (no artwork) paperwallets can be generated at a time without resulting in a memory over-run / crash to happen.  
Then take that SD Card out and then tape it to a note.  The note reminds you that you cannot use whilst the computer is connected to the Internet.  You will forget otherwise.
I love rPis - cheap and their "hard drives" are cheaper.  Hell, you can even destroy the SD card and only be out 5 bucks.  
PS - you can also make sure that the rPi's HRNG is configured &amp; working; though bitaddress uses other routes.  Still, entropy is entropy.

Perhaps for the phone vector, have the app prevent a future date that's too great.  What I mean, the user can put in a: day, week, two weeks, or month.  
That could be accomplished with a drop down input.  Minimizes the issues around what if I lose my phone, just need to not lose it within a smaller timeframe. And, the craziness of these run ups/runs downs are usually within a months time ( or so).

If you were screaming that you should have bought btc when it was reaching 1000+ USD, then guess what - congrats, btc is on sale.  Honestly, this is a common pattern in the space.
The run up, followed by a loooong lull and slow steady growth.  Completely agree with OP.  2000 USD around ~2017/18 sound about right.  Hell, I'm calling a further drop in six months from now (still buying now - cost averaging and all).  
You just need to realize that btc is a layer, and the real wealth comes from the tools and services it makes possible.

As do I (as well as a case wallet, entropy, keepKey, etc.) 
again, all are great products.  Each fills a niche slightly differently.  With that said:
We have this brand new thing based on Maths.  I would highly recommend that no one keep a substantial holding in any one place/object.  
I lose stuff all the time, granted one can rebuild one's wallet (hate that word but...) easily - it is just a pain in the butt and you are down for some amount of time.  One reason I would recommend against holding a lot in an object of this sort (Ledger, Trezor, etc...) That also assumes that you've properly set it up in the first place.
But wait - Bitcoin is based on Maths.  It costs next to nil to recompute a privKey/Addr pair.  Why not have many, many, many of these with small amounts.  The amount of work to 'crack' one these can be assumed to be fixed (at a lot).  So by spreading one's holdings to many paper wallets, each holding a trivial sum, you've rendered moot an attacker's motivation. Again, assumes that you've done this correctly as well.  
So instead of paying a lot for a fort knox, and hoping that you've locked the gates correctly that hold all your wealth... Bury nickels into the mud all over the planet in locations that you know.  
PS - you can always use a Ledger Starter.
@_date: 2016-12-13 03:06:41

Oftentimes people invest in this new idea due to a lot of side reasons.   After putting skin in the game, then they really learn what this tech can do - that's when the magic happens.

ipfs.io 
This is one of those projects/endeavors/movements that come around once in blue moon.  It seeks to rethink the web using distributed and decentralized notions. Basically how it ought to be.   
You can think of it, in some sense, as a mix of Dropbox and bit torrent.  I'm glossing a lot over, but the team behind this are super awesome.  
It is also how ethereum will handle the need for a hard drive.  After all, you build a world computer, you definitely need storage beyond ram.  
As for sbc- single board computer.  The most famous being the raspberry pi, but there are others (though the rPi still is the leader imho).   The fact that a un*x workstation can be had for 40 bucks just blows my mind still.  
Be careful, as you start building systems to assuage potential attack vectors - it can become a never ending thrill.  I really enjoy thinking of, then learning about, and finally crafting systems to increase my overall security.   It's a great hobby with the added benefit of one learning how to secure all you data from prying eyes. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 22:20:59
There's always pros and cons. Sounds like you have thought this out.  
Reading through the comments, I don't think it's reasonable to demand perfect security as that's impossible.  A good and layered approach is fine, an encrypted vol put in Dropbox - probably fine.  Sure, throwing this up on IPFS would be better - but that's not practical for most - at this time. 
Another idea, a pgp/gpg single encrypted file of the information and then emailed to you is probably fine. A slightly better might be having that information be in your handwriting and then scanned. Making a bad actor have to work a bit more (ocr).  
Many of the ideas here and elsewhere - sec really rests during access of said information.  Basically Whether or not a bad actor has owned your computer.   But sounds like you are already using a more secure os in the first place.  So that's a great step forward. 
Perhaps: Create a custom computing environment using a sbc, such as a rPi.   Put the image up on the cloud.  When you need access to information.  You can spin up a "cheap" offline computer and then be in a position to throw away the "hard drive" after use.  ( again I'm suggesting a clean os with all the tools you might use; any info that's important is stored outside of this img.   The idea being you could now access said info offline. )
Information rests in the cloud.  Your accessing it happens within an air gapped setting.  
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:25:01

What about a copay shared wallet 1 of 2.  That way, should they say screw it in the future the funds are not lost.  Just would have to explain at another encounter how to set up a private one.  But by then, I figure they actually care.  
Also. You can do most of the leg work - i.e. The setup and they just scan a qr code to join.  
@_date: 2016-12-25 06:01:23
Paper wallets, write down the seed, etc.  Use a hardware wallet, actually this is probably the best given the amounts in question. Buy two, put one in a safe place.  
Ledger is my fav, though trezor and the others are just as great now. 
Letting someone else hold your money is never a great idea, and insurance never seems to work when you need it.  Just my 2 cents.  
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:49:31
This is great, but - needs to be baked directly into the os. That's the only way the average person is going to even consider using this approach.  Also, I could see how a system update results in a unrecoverable hiccup with the various components.  
With the Fido alliance, perhaps getting it into MacOS is more possible. How else though could we as a community help this process along?  
@_date: 2015-08-09 05:30:26
Also, print (or otherwise have) another copy in reserve. I would expect a fair percentage of these being lost and/or never swept.  So, rather than having these coins lost forever - you have a backup plan.

I'm a big fan of Ledger products. They do exactly what they have been designed to do.
When I'm physically sitting in front of my computer, I use my ledger to make online buying that much easier/faster.  I've (recently) gotten the adaptor to use it with my android tablet (but I'm really an apple fanboy).  Still - they can't be beat when at a computer. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:02:19
Sure, I was thinking that current units at mining operations might be re-purpose (sold) to consumers.  This would probably do nothing to correct/fix the decentralization within this space.  For that, radical ideas would need to be considered - and I think that we see what a challenge that would be.
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:14:15
I've gotten perhaps a ~20 of these exact units throughout 2015/16 - either directly from Ledger at talks and/or over various websites (direct, purse.io, etc).  These have been for personal use and gifts (that I then help the person setup).
I have yet to see a unit that I would call 'poor quality'.  Since you took it upon yourself to dissemble the unit, there is no way to verify or understand your initial concerns.  
The one time that I did have a problem - it was software related.  Moving from a firmware for the HW.1 to the nano specific.  The team was highly responsive, and a solution was arrived at in a day's time.
Ledger builds products that are designed to work flawlessly and to hold up - they have to, as these products are being used to store actual value.  I trust every ledger I've ever bought, and I'm not a paid shill (just a reg person).  Again, I would have recommended not taking your unit apart if you wanted to call into question quality. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 03:16:56
So how long before this finds it way into actual hardware?  And what will the velocity of adoption look like?  
I can see how this might result in existing hardware being pushed out towards the consumer markets (maybe); whilst mining biz's move towards hardware that supports these concepts (provided they can actually realize the gains suggested.)  
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:47:55
Last I checked, most of my hot wallets were on either my iPhone or Nexus phones.  I would assume that many also use these devices to spend/buy.  
Being able to understand and have some control over these connected devices is critical for a wider audience to adopt this incredible technology called cryptocurrency.  This tech may stall/die if the average person just doesn't feel comfortable using their phone because of the fear that these can be opened by anyone in the future (with or without a warrant).

Jeff here (from Astroblocks), and I have to 100% agree with everything you said here.  It was during our presentation of Astroblocks (a proof of concept from our efforts from attending Blockchain University in Mountain View, CA), that we realized that a Block Chain based system could be applied towards more generalized challenges, such as the securing of ideas.  
While the process of securing a patent is a highly structured legal protocol, something that cannot (as of yet, nor in the near term future - in my opinion) be performed within a chain, we believe that you could create an environment where potential innovators can determine "how good their ideas really are" using a block chain. 
We're hoping to have something a bit more solid soon,and can't wait to share. The Internet of Chains is coming, and I really think that this technology will solve a lot of problems - simply.

Regardless of all the concerns that people are talking about (though I too believe to be highly valid)...
I could not help but to get goosebumps whilst reading this piece. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:59:31
I have both and it really depends upon your intended usage. 
Ledger if you plan on a more hot wallet'ish use pattern.  I.e. Making purchases online via your computer with it. 
Entropy if you plan on procuring btc and not really touching them for a while.  More cold wallet'ish, perhaps using your smart phone as a hot wallet. 
Really, both are bad ass and a ton of fun.  I think that entropy might be a bit more fun - only because it makes something physical.  Why not get one first, using your intended use as a guide - then pick up the other as a testing unit later.  
Be aware that these are (as are all hardward/software wallets) best described as beta - some more polished than others (but still beta.)  So take your time, be ready for a hiccup, and if you were careful you won't have to have a heart attack when you think you've lost all your coins. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:11:33
The amount of rapid progress that is being made in this space towards addressing these concerns is nothing short of amazing. So I'm not at all worried about Bitcoin being too hard for the average user, that will be fixed just like networking, email, and the "Internet" in general were.  
These core modern tools that so many depend upon today were nearly impossible for the average person twenty plus years ago, I know because I was there. 
So ask yourself if you are able to devote the needed time to learn and\or have the desire to get oneself up to speed. If either of these are a "no" then ask yourself what people you trust and understand this tech are saying about it. 
The shear amount of brain power being spent in this space ought to be enough to convince a person that this is important. And it can use more, so come in and build a better wallet.  That would be greatly welcomed by all. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:33:19
True - I have thought about getting one.  It's just hard for me to justify.  On the one hand, when I buy something (away from my computer) I use my phone.  At the computer and I'm probably going to use (again my phone).  So I'm trying to adjust my habits - so I'm working up to using a trezor.

UPDATE:  Solved.  I guess I was copy/pasting and the "--" somehow got merged into a single dash.  After hand typing that one out, it configured properly.

"git clone -b 0.10 
And for the "Configuring and building" portion::
Couple of things - I believe:
that instead of "libtools" I had to use "libtool"

Mining is centralized - due to cheap power.  The ten or so hubs for mining operations are situated around low cost energy bills.  How to turn this around, I don't know - it is a complex problem.

Saw some others posting their "family" photos - thought to do the same.  Can't wait to try out the Entropy device later today.  Seems well made.
Between all of these, I think that (based on my comfort level) the Entropy will be the most used by me.  I just like the idea of paper, though I see the need to have a external device sign (particularly if you always assume a computer has been compromised.)

This isn't helping anyone, and most likely turning this person off to the concept. This is a BAD thing, and you should probably stop immediately. Then explain what's what and help set up a real wallet/client software (funding it to boot) - point to purse.io or shinybadges.com or whatever to use said coin.  OB probably too advance for most still.

Honestly, this is an important idea that doesn't get the attn it should.   For many here, MFA (I think we are beyond simple 2fa) coupled with vastly different tech to hold our coin ( hardware, software, etc) - means that our family members that are normal people wouldn't be able to take receipt of our coins should we pass.  
1) Document everything.  You should for everything else already. If you haven't written up an end of life manual, nows your reason for doing so.   Just don't put pins and passwords in (if it's an electric document).  Keyloggers and all.  I have blank boxes that I can then manually write in this info.  
2) print copies.  Plural.  Make sure loved ones know where they are.  
3) paper wallets for bitcoin, still the best long term device IMHO.

I'm interested if we can send this one (and perhaps a couple more back) and if the folks at Mycelium can inspect to determine what's what.
So mycelium:: Can you put something up on your website, asking for volunteers that believe their device was compromised in transit to send their unit back.  Then publish the results of your testing/tear downs?
I imagine if asked, you could get perhaps twenty units returned for inspection.  As for the costs out of pocket, think about this as an advertising expense.  Hell, I think that if you asked for donations from the community to cover the costs of this "audit" - we'd chip in.

So Craig Wrong has shown a key (not keys)?  It is entirely possible that Mr. Wrong has been calculating away possibilities, didn't he have some big iron in his garage?  Let us consider:  The quality of trng (and even prng) has been progressing at an amazing pace these past few years. 
This was not the case back in 2009.  In addition, it is entirely possible that this first key(s) was purposefully created - for someone to find.  A message in the bottle to be discovered. And it just happened that Mr. Wrong found it - and is now trying to get 30 minutes of fame (he's already had his 15 a few months back).  
If Mr. Wrong is SN, then he ought to move all his early pay-to-publicKey to something a bit more secure.  But even that would not be 100%, as it just might demonstrate that a problem with ECDSA has been found.  This whole nonsense is nonsense.

Hard fork - I could get behind that.  But I remember the days when there were no transactions - for hours.  That wasn't that long ago.

I'm bullish about this; however, a number of advances will need to come first.  At least, for the type of system that I'd feel great using.
That said - I fully expect it to be available soon'ish.
What would such a system offer?  
Funds distributed on a schedule (not possible today, i.e.: daily) - something that would help lessen poor decisions.  NOTE:  I'd rather not dedicate my last wishes, rather - having loved ones with 'issues' - I'd like to make sure that they can take care of themselves day-to-day.  
Perhaps even having funds tied to specifics - like food, daily needs.  I.e. Colored coins that can be used anywhere.
Something that is invisible to the user.  I love tech, been that way as long as I can remember.  Not everyone is like me - and that is great.  I want this tech to become transparent, it just works.
This is just a small number of 'wants'. I know we will get there, this space moves in dog years.

Cannot stress enough - offline / air gapped computer.   
If you have a raspberry pi, then this is the least troublesome approach (my opinion).  As you can setup you rPi software-wise, make sure it can print (USB), and has other helpful softwares installed (veracryt -sp). It is here that I then image the card, so that in the future I can start at this point my upgrading.
Then reboot without Internet/WiFi/etc.  make your keys, print (at least two copies), and make a set, save the addresses to usb, privKey only if the stick is encrypted.  
Then you just need to remove you sd card.  Either tape it, so you don't accidentally use and store - or destroy.  If you get one for ~5 bucks and your can't store easy, then perhaps cut and throw.

It can seem confusing, that is completely normal.  A couple of great resources::
And there's a ton of tutorials, I would probably also recommend reading either::
Bitcoin for the befuddled
Mastering Bitcoin
Both are excellent and can be found online.
As for bitaddress.org questions:
1)  The private keys provide the proof that you have been given control of a UTXO (ala bitcoin).  That's weird - to be honest...  You never 'own' a bitcoin - like a dollar (assuming you are in the US).  What I mean, you can open up your wallet and physically take out a note - you 'own' that.  In Bitcoin, you simply have the rights of control over some amount of coin.  You can transfer (spend) that control to another address.  But you never 'own' them - they live within the Blockchain.  That's actually great - for a number of reasons.
2)  The term 'wallet' is a terrible one - that has unfortunately stuck.  Wallets ought to be called client software or Experiencing the Blockchain really.  But one's wallet typically contains your privKeys that can be used to show control of bitcoin - so that you can spend.  They also create addresses that allow others to 'pay' you.  Again, the wallet really is a window that allows you to interact or experience the Blockchain.  All the information and all the bitcoin lives there. 
3)  on bitaddress.org - under paper wallet, there is a radio button called "BIP 38 Encrypt?".  This allows you to encrypt your privKeys with a password.  This is a great practice - as it allows you security, even if your paper wallet is found by someone else.  
When making paperwallets - it really isn't like wallets in real life.  What I mean, you probably have a wallet - and you put value in it.  Here, paperwallets, are really key pairs that can be used to digitally sign / prove ownership of value for movement reasons.  One security model is therefore, have a LOT of paperwallets, and only put a small amount of coin in each.  Now an attacker has to spend X work on one pair, and the same amount of work for the next.  Basically, you have made the payoff for stealing from you - not worth it...
4)  Different addresses for each transaction - yes.  But not really for privacy purpose (I guess).  The reason that I would instead point towards - when you spend, you must ineffect put your Public Key on the Blockchain.  Addresses are not public keys, rather a hash function of them.  But when you put a public key - then it is potentially open to quantum computer attack in the future - as one could (maybe) back compute the privKey and spend out of that any remaining coin.  So one should probably use a different change address.  Oh - yeah, all bitcoin in a UTXO must be depleted in a transaction... But you'll read about that.
As for the how - again, one's software will take care of this.  So my recommendation::
A)  Have a wallet on your phone, and put inside the same amount that you'd feel comfortable if it were your real wallet.  This is your hot wallet - the one that you spend out of.
B)  The remaining amount you create from an air gap'ed computer (rPi e.g.) many, many, many paperwallets (BIP38 encrypted) - putting in some amount X.  If you need access of this amount in the future - you can then sweep this amount in by having your smart phone wallet scan the qr code of the privKey and entering the password.

We all talk about the great decentralized experiment that is Bitcoin, but we accept the highly centralized nature of mining (one of the most important aspects of this protocol).  
I recall talking about this very idea of changing up the algo a couple of years ago...right before the onslaught of ASICs.  And boy did people think I was an idiot (probably right.) 
Though some did a great job of explaining how these would result in a more secure Blockchain overall - and I have to agree.  Though there is a part of me that just loved vertcoin (and still do).  
Changing the PoW algo would be just too difficult to do in today's climate.  Though I could see a black swan event - maybe - perhaps allowing this to happen.  I just don't see an easy solution here.
@_date: 2016-05-24 06:14:30
One of the reasons that I'm so interested in the Blockchain - it represents history.  But there's more... Imagine history that isn't rewritten after each election, coup, whatever. It just is - good/bad/it doesn't matter.
Now we want to cull UTXOs that we don't like (old, small, etc).  That sort of sounds like the systems that I see around me today.  I don't like this feature of humanity, we can do better - and having a complete Blockchain is a step in the right direction.  
You talk about rules around lifetimes - who (or what groups) make this decision?  Lack of participation == your UTXOs are gone.  What's to stop one group from locking up another group that they deem inferior, limiting meaningful participation/voting. Can't happen...history is filled with examples. 
Lastly, bringing up the 2106 issue - how are we not to write all of this off as being anything other than FUD?  
@_date: 2016-05-24 06:20:26
Could you unpack this a bit more?  
I don't really understand what it is that you are saying.  You can run a full node in pruning mode if your computer is running low on storage space.  But really... I just bought a 128 GB micro sd card for one of my rPi's for the cost of a dinner + a beer.
As for addresses - that's something entirely different.  That's based on EC Maths &amp; Hashing...  It would cost a lot of clock cycles to run through the UTXO's and see if they fit a pattern or not.   And then blacklist these?  So wouldn't you need to then maintain a separate list... and we are back to square one.

Basically, it opened my eyes at how many haven't a clue about fiat.  They think it's made by the government, backed by gold, and all sorts of nonsense.

F2Pool is ~25%, looking at the next few it's:  Antpool, BTCC, BW, BitFury.  Whilst some have their own mining operations - you could fire up your rig and mine with these listed. 
Allow me to rephrase - Let us forget about the miners that have extensive hardware situated in regions that have cheap power.  Let us assume that all pools are run by individuals with similar hardware/power bills that need servicing.  (Big assumptions - but we will use these)...
I, as an individual miner, would need to be in a group.  The top five (5) groups (listed above) represent ~75% hashing power of the network (presently, according to blockchain.info's stats).  My individual rig's hashing power is feeding into one of these five organizations.  
I don't like what AntPool is doing perhaps - they are running Bitcoin-qt ;-) and I think that they ought to be running Bitcoin Classic.  What are my options?   Email Admin... I could switch pools.  But what if the other four are also running a version of the software I do not agree with?  That's centralization (at least in my book.)  
Sure I could run my rig solo - and let Poisson and luck do the rest.  But how many can do this before one's power bill puts a stop to this? This is what we currently have.  That's not what I personally like at all - how though do we change this reality?  Ideally, one person - one vote on the history of the Blockchain; what does that algo look like though.

I would have the seed in an encrypted volume, trucrypt (yeah I know but for these uses, done correctly it is still OK).  Have multiple copies of this vol so you don't have to sorry about closure. 
You are using something like lastpass or the like to help in generate ing your passwords. If not then use one of these tools.  
I would also have a hot wallet with an account I wouldn't care got stolen and cold storage that I would forget about.

Reading through these bro's saying typical bro things is painful - and I don't understand at all.  If you are really interested in Bitcoin and Block Chain technologies remapping society, then one would ought to (at least in my mind) understand how to open this up to the widest possible audience.  What are the barriers that they see, what is being done or not done, etc... Instead I'm having to read through:
bro : What about men?

When you talk about cold storage - paper is one vector; however, as todaywasawesome said:  it is inconvenient. 
And by having an electronic copy on media (in addition to paper) that has never touched a networked computer, is still a form of cold storage.  Just have it properly encrypted, should you lose physical control of said media.  
Considering how this particular topic affects us directly, I see no reason to question it being discussed in r/bitcoin.  It is an important tool.  As for password management systems, these are (typically) on networked computers, and so they should be assumed to be compromised.  
Also, the idea of a crowdfunded audit of this nature - understanding 'how' to do one of these correctly, might help out the community in the future...perhaps having outside audits of this type applied to core components of the various bitcoin implementation(s) that are appearing.   
@_date: 2015-02-20 04:23:27
The maze, for me at least, makes the piece feel like something I would have had as a kid.  I think that Bitcoin is like that, it has given me something to dream/play with - the possibilities are endless, with new ideas springing forth all over the place.  
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:15:58
I would highly recommend, if you are using a software wallet that offers encryption of it's data to do so.  That is best practice.
However, I was talking about the creation of Addr/Keys by hand.  Eg: running on an offline computer, node.js and using bitcore/bitcoinjs-lib/etc (or even cloning bitaddress.org and running that).  
In these situations, you will have created addr/keys and now need a place to 'store' them.  One idea is paper, but you could also store an electronic copy - just place this copy within a secured volume (like a truecrypt vol.)  
@_date: 2015-02-19 04:07:21
A lot actually.  If you are storing your priv keys (as you should), then you will need someplace to put said keys.  This is an excellent tool - and an important one to get right.

Generally speaking...
If a bartender pours a three ounce cocktail, we immediately realize that that is theft. Why?  It wasn't their booze to give out - it was the house that paid for it.  But you say, there is no exchange of physical goods....
A web-based company spends a great deal of money to get eyeballs on their product/service.  If I'm an employee of a web-based company, put in a position of power that allows me the ability to direct those eyeballs how I please (eyeballs paid for by shareholders - mind you) for my personal advancement.  Well, that is also theft.

The fact is, many mining operations tag the blocks that they find.  From this data, one can paint a reasonable picture of the present day landscape.  
Unless you are suggesting that individuals are finding blocks and giving credit to these larger orgs for some reason.  
Do I personally like this - no.   I'd rather this function be distributed to all nodes.  I myself enjoyed mining, and think a lot of people got into this because of mining.  Newer people only see Bitcoin in terms of speculation and not of a push towards a more decentralized future.

He's given a lot already - so I don't think you call for him to 'conform' to your payment preferences is appropriate.  Chances are, the tools he makes are being used and helping you as of right now.
He probably doesn't even know we are talking about him on "reddit" - probably hasn't heard of it/doesn't have an account (I might be wrong).  Maybe he hasn't had time to look into this "bitcoin" thingie (he's too busy compiling gpg)... whatever.  The site that is presently up takes CC or Paypal.
It would be great if you could reach out and see about getting these other forms of payment implemented.   Perhaps send out an email and/or offer to help in setting this up.  That would be swell.  My German isn't all that great, so I don't know about me....

I really don't know if this has been handled correctly:
1) Questions were answered, sort of. I'm sure people are going to be explaining how I'm wrong, or asking me for clarification as to what I mean. However, a normal person reading through this thread will get a sense of these pseudo-answers.
2)  OP was basically censored due to the mentioning of the name of the Director of Data Science - ok.  But is this information really that secret as to warrant a take down? (Many comments that explain OP are now gone - leaving behind an incomplete picture)
Personally, I don't think so - censoring (again - my personal opinion) is a BIG deal and requires a lot of consideration, evidence, and discourse.   I don't know if this happened.  I'm rather interested in how a name was associated with the handle - that implies some data that hasn't been shared/explained.
3) Why not have the person in question at coinbase get on the thread - I'm sure they have a reddit account.  Get in front of this.  Maybe this vector wouldn't be necessary, had it been completely explained that what the OP was claiming did not happen as believed or corrective actions X-Y-Z have been put into place (by the way, too late to claim this now).  
All too often I see people that dance around ethical edges and when they get away with these excursions, pat themselves on the back for being so "smart".  And after all, that's what others want from them (being smart)... That's the rationalization at least.  I'm not saying that this happened in this case, but to me at least - there are some nagging/unanswered questions.

I'm glad to see someone from coinbase commenting.  I'm a bit upset at how the OP has been treated by some of the community members' replies here. 
With that said, personally, this person needs to be let go.  This type of behavior, while perhaps legal, is too close to an ethical edge.  And creates a climate where everyone is willing to play at edges, and perhaps even dance over that fine line.
I realize one can rationalize this, claim smart reasons 1-2-3 why this is "a-ok".  
It isn't.  If this actually happened, then this person acted poorly and needs to be let go.  I'm all for incremental workplace sanctioning - except in the case of officers.  These folks are in a position of power, authority, and responsibility.  
Too often people want roles and the riches, and not the responsibilities these roles entail.  
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:56:41
Ethics and stuff...   
This is like watching any employee skimming from the company.  Except, IMOP, when an officer of the company does this - it creates a culture of poor ethics.  One that poisons the entire place quickly as the idea of ,"what's the harm" is applied to more and more shady behaviors.  
I'd like more data about this claim. But if it is true, coinbase needs to let this person go in a very public way.  If it is true and coinbase keeps this officer, then I personally need to reevaluate my support and ask my friends to do the same.
I've seen more than my share of company b/s in this life - the ultimate outcome is all too plain for me. Those of us that have been around the block will know what I'm talking about.

One tool to greatly help with passphrases, yubikeys.
You can configure them to hold (effectively) static passphrases (two to be exact.)  The name of the game is entropy, and this is a physical artifact that makes it easy to carry around entropy. 
I could see you using this to hold your BIP38's passphrase.  Such that, this passphrase is a mashing down of the keyboard (granted this is not sampling the entire keyspace - but is still solid IMHOP.)  
You might be asking yourself - didn't he say it can only hold two (2) passphrases in memory, doesn't sound useful...  It holds two strings of information.  You can 'salt' this in the frontend for your needs; thereby, making it possible to use for all your needs.  E.g.::
Using for your Ebay account::  "ebay"+yubikey
Using for your FB account::     "fb"+yubikey
Hence, each site is using a unique passphrase that doesn't break the remembering bank.  
Couple of notes:  
1)  The "Blue" ones are only FIDO - and hence won't behave as I described above - only the "Black" ones do.
2)  Just like keys to a car - you wouldn't be ok just having the one set.  Get at least two, incase one breaks.
3)  Handwrite these strings and secure (if you can) - just in case the keys are lost/broken.
Also - (and this is for everyone) - have end of life documents that make it easy for a loved one to figure this out.

The degree of penetration will necessarily prompt many to come to market with units - thus driving down costs to the consumer.  
With more places that accept btc - the more reasons to have a wallet like this also.  Right now there are too few shops that I can walk into and use, and I am too scared to have anything on my smartphones (iPhone or Nexus devices) considering how easy these are compromised.

I'm more concerned about if in the future you can 'see' if a bitcoin has had tax paid upon it (whatever form that "tax" takes) and if not, then the receiver is able to decline acceptance. 
Eg.  You go to pay your utility bill, the utility company is transferred a bitcoin that has not been properly maintained (i.e. taxed accordingly - whatever form is local custom) and the payment is then declined.  
There is reason that US currency has written on it - a note that must be taken for all debts public or private.  There isn't such a claim on btc.  This is a worry.  (Please don't get me wrong - I love the tech, but do wonder about how those in power will try to maintain the status quo.)

I can't trust them - first screw up I was willing to overlook.  (Basically the deposit code died when I was trying to get in on a great ltc/btc ratio.)  Well I do appreciate how much communication/tweets they do - so I was willing to give them a pass.  Code doesn't always behave they way we think it should - particularly when you stress it in novel ways.
But getting a bulk email (that wasn't labeled as such) suggesting that I have had my account frozen because of a neg balance.  That is just insane. Upon contacting support about this - don't tell me you are "100% sure" without first doing a bit of research.  After a stressful day and a half - turns out I didn't have a neg balance, this was a bulk email that was sent to all in the land, and it should have been worded a lot better/clearer.  
I got out and will stay out.  Just cannot feel comfortable with a biz that thinks that bulk emails that are not labeled as such (nor with next steps) is a good idea.  I can understand screw ups in the code - but not being able to write a clear and concise letter to customers?  That's a bit much.

Yes.   Couldnt agree more.  On the one hand I shudder to think what some corporate board driven sec IT team would come up with.  Overly complicated just to give the illusion of security, while at the same time making it hard for joe consumer to get at her funds.
Whereas the folks currently behind bitcoin seems to understand how computers work as well as the network.   So the measures taken are a better balance of hassle and security, I.e. a little less driven by pure illusion.   
True security, hassle, and (unfortunately ) illusion of are the three variables that must be considered with any such system.  I just don't think that corporate banking systems have the internal structures in place to allow for more effective tuning of these three variables.  Hence the current crop of banks that just turn up illusion to 11.

I see this as showing a human failing.  The three pounds of flesh between our ears did not evolve to understand the exponential function well - as such we really have to be careful.  
The e.g. given is one of recent history that many folks have probable already forgotten.  Recall - it was damn hard to text, but no more - what happened?  We had non-linear leaps in the technology, resulting in powerful/usable/affordable smartphones/etc - voice rec that works - infrastructure that was not even dream'able back in the mid/late '90s.  And what is the end result, no one talks - everyone does actually "type" because is it way easier.  
A bit of background:  I was that guy back in the '90s with all the latest tech - wizards/Newtons/Palm/Handsprings/Treo/Bunch of stuff from Japan - and I tried to convince people that using these "wasn't hard".  Well, now that I look back - maybe it was 'hard'.  But now that we have radically advanced tools and ideas it isn't.
I think that we're going to see this with bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a protocol that allows technology to be mapped ontop of it.  That's big.  The services and ideas that will now be possible are just now being dreamt of and/or implemented in crude approximations.  I see nothing but moon in bitcoin's future and maybe remembering our not so long ago past will provide us much needed perspective.

I don't know about your statement, "(...)no company is going to recognize that degree."
Every HR department I've ever seen can be best summed up at best a collection of pure paper pushers.  Folks that don't follow up, follow through, nor have the desire to even determine if what you've put down is 'real' or not.  
Hell - I've even had one (from a LARGE entity) question whether or not an Engineering Masters' degree from Cornell University would be acceptable, as that particular school wasn't in their approved list to give out Engineering degrees.  (Cornell's sort of known for their engineering and such.)

This tells me that the corporate bigwigs can't be bothered reading about bitcoin and this was the only mechanism (from someone that does understand this tech) had to get this information out within the organization.  
Sort of reminds me when a reporter at a newspaper trade conference basically showed a photo of Craig Newmark to a bunch of newspaper big-wigs and tried to explain that Craig was about to eat their lunch.  I think we all know how that turned out.

I think this is a great meme actually. 
I'm at the end of gen x, and when I was growing up banks served a real and important societal function.  However, all that I remember - that's gone.  Banks are for the most part too busy thinking of new fees and mechanisms to turn the screws on you.  I think I saw a posting here a little while ago mentioning this (something about not knowing how hard the banks such until bitcoin…)  I agree with this, and have seen this in my lifetime how the banking sector has degraded to joe and jane consumer.
Not more than one hour ago, I went to the bank to deposit some rolls of change.  Rolls that I had procured from this very same branch a couple of months prior  (end of year and I want to clean out my desk and all).  Also, I was going shopping and thought, two birds …
Well, I go in - fill out the deposit slip and proceed to place my rolls of change and slip on the table for the teller.  This person immediately looked at me as if I had dumped a dead bird before him, and told me, "we don't accept these, we don't have room in our vault".  I must of have had a quizzical look, so he thanked me for allowing him to serve me - thank you sir - good bye sir.  By the by, it was a 'real bank' - Wells Fargo (I'm in the Bay Area.)  I thought whatever, life's too short - go to another branch.  Still...
You might be thinking - one datum, probably a rogue employee, maybe I failed to uphold my end of the social contract - etc…  But I really think that if banks don't want to provide services (and I'm not really talking about accepting rolls of coins) like banks that I grew up around once did, then we have to recognize the power of bitcoin to allow folks like myself to DIY.  That's the amazing point and power behind btc.  
Sure, its the wild wild west at the moment.  It's hard for non-tech people.  There's some questions about adoption/use/tax/etc.  All of these things are going to be worked out in time. 
So I see see this meme as demonstrating the power of btc over what banks have become.  Maybe I won't have put the return (as that's highly volatile - i.e. a neg behind this tech at the moment).

They are not an exchange.  Cannot over state this. It sounds like you are or were using them in this manner. With the buying and selling.
Also this is a longish post with little real info. 
Coinbase is a great company to procure bitcoin. They do not want to be in the exchange space and don't operate well as such. 
That also have great customer service. I wish people would stop using reddit as their soapbox whenever they feel slighted by coin base.

Insane.   I recall when shor's paper came out and thinking how cool would that be. Never thinking that I would live to see it actually, practically implemented.   I believe that I will now, and think that's swell.  
Update:  By my use of the word practical, I was thinking "demonstrated potential" in the journal of ...   But thinking more and more about this, I can't help but to think that when actual honest to goodness cash is on the line - things seem to get done.  Perhaps we as a species will craft working and workable quantum computers, that some programmer/builder laboring in their basement one late night will knock this out - if only to grab our bitcoins and/or the ensuing karma around such a feat.
I'm sort of cool with that. Is that wrong of me?
I just think having such a device could then be used for so much more good. After all, there are legitimate problems that quantum computers and only quantum computers can answer (in a reasonable amount of time.)

Well, didn't get picked so back to teaching soon - thought that I would check in.  Doesn't seem to be anything here.  
Basically, just wondering if anyone else thought that this would be a somewhat useful idea - to reach out to CHM and/or ideas for materials/stories to display. And really any contacts that would be willing to listen/have a coffee perhaps (since I'm in the area and all).  Cheers

Unreal - and the real burn - the interjections were so tangential.  I was amazed how Chamath though would take them in stride, build up, and then bring them back towards his original ideas that he was trying to vocalize before being interrupted (and being graceful to boot).

It's really the principle of the matter.  Its basically because this dude, who should never have been given passage into this land, and he's just pissing all around the place.  Just a disrespectful prick really, unable to understand what's being tried with this grand experiment.

Stay away - they are legit, but…
Signed up with them a while ago to be able to switch between coins.  Well, it seems like whenever there's a great ratio of (for example) ltc/btc and I try to get in - there's all sorts of tech problems.  
One time my deposits took basically a day and half to show up.  That ratio I was talking about - yeah, it was long since gone.  And I can understand your first deposit maybe taking time - this was not my first time using their system.
Weeks later -  I get (along with everyone else) a bulk email about how my account is frozen because of a negative balance.  I immediately emailed support only to be given boilerplate about that other problem I had with deposits nearly a month ago.  
Next day - get a reply about how their are "100 % sure" that I have a negative balance.  I didn't.  But it took a full day to sort out. 
I'm fairly pissed - why, I don't trust them anymore and as such I'm pissed because I don't have an exchange in the USA that I can use.  
This place really needs to tighten up - tighten up the code, SOPs, and overall customer service.  I do like how they tweet a lot as to what's happening in the system.  Because of this, I was able to forgive them about losing out on that ltc/btc ratio.  Getting a bulk email (that wasn't labeled as such) about a neg balance that wasn't - that's just a bit too much.

I can't up vote this enough.  
So far, one can count on one's hand the number of BFL units seen in the wild - and they all seem to be going to places/sites that end up not using or breaking them open.  I would think that if I got one of these units - sure I'd do the unboxing video, but I would be mining the baby jesus out of it, considering there's a buttload of folks clawing for their order to be fulfilled.

Seems like a great cause - I know that I would feel more likely to trust this app to perform as billed.   I found that it is odd that the software hasn't been yet been independently audited like this yet - considering...

I believe 3.50 -  sorry but couldn't help myself
Is there any numbers of how many of these are out in the field/been made?   Could you poll pools to see hardware used by individuals?  The costs for these would be the ip for chip design(s), pcb layout(s), assembly setup, etc.   without knowing how many have been made/will be made - it would be hard to understand unit costs. 
I'm thinking since there's only slowly been a competitor emerge (for this class of device) - the profit is slim.  I think that those that could pull this off (ie tech skills) have run the numbers and weren't able to create a compelling business plan to secure the needed vc.  What do you think, I could be crazy.  
@_date: 2013-07-31 18:08:32
Sure - But I'd be happy to see this just done for the pure academic joy of it all.  To think that as a species, we could make these types of toys - well, that's reward enough.  
I mean - we have the program(s) and the last time I looked (and I haven't in a while - not my field really - so there's probably been advancements here) I think that an 8 qubit computer was made (probably been upgraded significantly by now).  Putting this together and the hard work to advance all of this tech forward - if we can build such an instrument, it means that we as a bag of mostly water will have been able to see all possibilities in order answer an asked question.  How cool is that - to be able to manipulate waves of information. 
PS - I don't understand the down votes?  Have an up vote!

I believe so.  What I like the most about this product - the care behind data collection and the iterative process that went into the crafting of this product.  Being honest about failures and building from them each successive try.
I too am thrilled that I can buy this for myself.  Though I believe one could create this product from the raw materials given the information that's been provided during their process - I don't think that I would have the desire to make it from scratch myself.  
Plus coinbase - how cool is that!  (Though I'll probably use CC as I can't see myself parting with any of my btc - though I hope to over come this fear in the near future.)

Upgraded my iPhone to the 5 a while back and had to learn the hard way about how the google authentication app gets backed up and all.
It does not get backup via icloud (specifically the apps data). So when i did a icloud restore to my new iPhone - all my codes were gone.  It was a pain manually resetting those.
I should have performed a local backup via iTunes with encryption for the data not to be wiped out.  
Please make sure when migrating to a new phone, perform a proper backup- so your codes are not wiped clean.

So we shouldn't name them based upon the metric system - I think a lot of folks (mostly non-Americans) are perfectly comfortable with this system.  
Anything else and you run the risk of alienating at least one group, probably more.  Because why didn't their name get used instead of your's?…
Metric baby - it's accepted/used/and known to many the world over, and this tech really is a planet wide endeavor.

Got one of these too - basically a BS bulk email that was just shotgun'ed to everyone in the land.  Trying to contact support was laughable. 
My first email back from support was about a problem that I had over a month ago (it was resolved back then).  So I thought that this neg bal email was fake.
Next day - received another email back from support about my inquiry into this neg bal email.  This second email chained turned out to be a bad joke - basically the person told me that s/he was "100% sure" that I had a negative balance.  Turns out I did not - after three emails back/forth; and me screen shooting everything.  
Firstly, I would have appreciated it if they had mentioned in their email something to the effect of, "…this is a bulk email and may or may not apply to you … please do X to determine if you are affected."
Secondly, when I email support - do a bit of research before telling me that you're "100% sure" of anything (I did have to supply my userID, email, etc - you can find me in your own system).  Also, it would have been nice to have had a name on those emails instead of a leet name that I can't figure out - sure it's cool and all, but money is on the line and I would like to get to it already without having to guess.
Overall, I withdrew my remaining coin and think that I can't trust them anymore - without trust, this type of biz cannot succeed.  Its a shame really.

Reading that was a chore. This person really hasn't the necessary understanding to make such off the wall "predictions".  
My two bits - don't bet against the protocol.  Historically once we have a working one, all bets are off and sky's the limit. Because one can build on top of it.  Too many folks don't understand this or try to use old world thinking for new technology.  Doesn't work, hasn't worked in the past either.

I actually was wondering this as well.  When I went there and couldn't resolve with https but could with http, I wasn't feeling it.  I searched high and low to verify that this was correct, and because there's no mention of their lack of ssl - I couldn't be sure I was being directed to the correct site.  Litecoin.org has it, bitcoin ought to as well.
