@_date: 2017-11-20 18:05:59
It has this little advantage that i cant trade but not too many people use it for daily trading so far. But i can promise you something will happen with those fees sooner than we might think :D
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:58:21
It defenitly will make profit, if your Electricity costs arent to high.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:23:38
But its only on android i think :D
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:24:19

I had this Problem with mycelium one day. Mycelium had the option to pay fees again. So I payed about 7$ again and it went trough within 2hours. Dont know about Electrum though........

I use the StockMarket Teletrader :D It can display many currencies :D
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:32:29
Did you already check the adreses again? It would suck if you sent your BTC to a wrong wallet. Otherwise there is not much to do instead of wait i guess :D
Maybe your BTC is sent with super low Transaction fees, then you just have to wait or spend some more BTC to get the transaction through :D

Nice man well done :D
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:09:03
I would actually w8 until we finally hit the 10k because I think many people will sell at 10k. So I personally would w8 for the next dip.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:14:08
Everybody would love to know that
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:43:06
Yeee somebody should relly do that. I new "Amazon" just with Crypto payments. But we would need to get that out faster then amazon. I think they are already working on it.
But we would need to find some people that really have the knowledge to do that.

10k is the Dream for a longer period of time now, so i think alot of people will sell at that point so iam preparing for another buy option.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:26:44
omfg my everything wants to cry :/
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:38:58
Depens if the lightning system comes to BTC if it does it will be good for daily transactions :D With these high transaction fees its more likely to work like gold in the past :D Because if u want to buy a meal for 6 bucks u dont want to pay 7 bucks transaction fees right :D
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:36:57
na not working for me :D
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:23:39
