I agree with you. As they say [in this article](




This is what's happening in Bitcoin, and to a degree, a better analogy is not with Ponzi schemes, but with lottery jackpots. You know how the Megamillions or Powerball jackpots, once they rise above a certain levels, tend to rise exponentially? 
That's because the higher jackpot generates news, which excites people and causes them to buy more tickets (increases demand), which in turn goes to an even greater jackpot - until someone wins the lottery.
With bitcoin we have the same dynamic - the price usually moves sideways in a certain range, but once it breaks out above it, this starts generating news articles, which bring new investors, who bid up the price, which generates even more news articles, which bring even more new investors, who bid up the price even more, and so on.

If so then Bitcoin price depends on demand by high school and university students - 2 demographics notorious for not having any money.

Well maybe I'm old-school but I prefer open-source to just mean that you provide the source code instead of only the compiled binary when distributing your software. That's what "open-source" was intended to mean when it was coined after all. Otherwise we can call the New York Times open-source because they publish their stories, and open-source would become a synonym for "public".
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:15:19


Unless they're writing software I don't see how they can be open-source. I feel like this term is being used as a techno-babble here.

What if existing investors run out of spare cash to keep buying? I mean most are Millennials who throw beer money at it. If there are no new investors there is only so much money that existing "believers" can throw @ the market before running out of money.

Yeah, that was weird. Was he evading taxes or something?
@_date: 2018-10-24 03:12:15
Never heard of that one. 
Edit:  OK now I get it. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:04:17
Well that should be enough to bump the price  of bitcoin a couple of thousand dollars ;)

Fiat services should be even faster in theory. Banks are just sending data and when you move money, 2 banks each add 2 entries to their ledger. And they don't need to hash numbers like miners do.

Why would BAKKT cause a bullrun? Most here repeat it like a magical formula, but they never explain why it would increase the price. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 09:31:54


You don't say...
@_date: 2018-11-03 18:25:21
Oh, cool. How many banks have lined up to trade Bitcoin on BAKKT and how much total capital have they allocated to Bitcoin purchases?

Student loans.

Well, tbh if I'd bought at $1 I'd have sold the moment I learned it got to $1000, so at most I'd have had $100,000. Certainly a tidy sum but not something to retire on. And this only if I didn't learn about it getting to $100 first.

I wish they start using him as a meme.

Walter obsessed way too much with it. He should have just moved on.
Let me share my "bitcoin story".
I had learned about bitcoin in 2011. At that time I thought it was a cool idea but at $32 it seemed a bit pricey. Then it fell to about $1 and I thought "cool, I'd buy maybe $100 worth of those just for the heck of it". I didn't know anyone who could sell them to me though, and I wasn't about to provide my personal info to one of the exchanges to buy a supposedly "anonymous" currency - that kind of defeats the purpose. 
2 years later I learned a friend of mine had become a miner, so I bought maybe 2-3 bitcoins - at that time the price had become $20-$30 again (or maybe $10?). I tried spending them and quickly found out there's not much I can buy. In the end I bought some reddit gold, sent some donations to bitcoin clients, and I sent the rest to the ukraine protesters at euromaidan when they had shown a QR code for bitcoin.
I've never felt the urge to treat it as an investment and I still don't understand this whole thing with the exchanges and trading it. I liked the idea of an anonymous currency and I'm still waiting for bitcoin to gain traction so I can use it. I don't mind if I never make a dime out of investing in it. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:55:36
You could put it that way, too, but what I meant is that I'm not a fan of the exchanges or from trying to get rich by "investing" in bitcoin. As for "won", I've never thought that bitcoin's purpose is to remove all other currencies, I'd be fine with it coexisting with them.
@_date: 2018-07-06 08:45:04
Well it's easy - start buying at $21,000. Just make sure to buy a lot of them.
@_date: 2018-07-07 10:41:01
Yes, bitcoins will still be there, even if noone is trading them for dollars.

Thanks for the link, I knew there was something fishy in the factoid. In this case, apparently they took a statistic about a very specific type of warrant - one issued only against foreigners (i.e. non-voters so their protests don't matter), and applied it to ALL types of warrants.
How do you take a statistic about warrants against foreign spies, issued at the federal level, and extrapolate it to warrants about no-knock drug raids issued by a county judge, is beyond me.
@_date: 2016-05-08 14:49:16


Is that really true though, or is it just one of those little factoids that  everyone is repeating on reddit and nobody fact-checks?
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:48:29
Yeah, but unless you have a time machine you can't go back and sell at Dec 2017 prices. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 07:15:23
Most people who buy gold are hoping that the next guy will pay them the same as they paid - inflation adjusted of course.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:33:45
I've been wondering this for a while - do institutional investors want to buy crypto, or do Redditors here want them to want to buy crypto?
Cause I've heard institutional money is coming, but now that I think of it, I don't remember hearing it it from those institutional investors themselves, whoever they are. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 07:16:05
Buy ze dip, dipshits!
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:21:12
Yes, falling prices are market manipulation, only rising prices are natural. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 07:24:42
Oh, yeah, I forgot that past performance doth guarantee future returns.
