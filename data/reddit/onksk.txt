Haven't been staring at the blockchain enough it seems

Exchanges trading with each other

Cool, it's like having your own little seat in the ECB of bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:53:07
I've been mining, but don't quite understand how exactly does the miner decide that? I mean the machine was just churning away. So I'm guessing it has something to do with the firmware the miner runs?
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:55:47
remarkable top timings

Cool, now to wait until someone releases a custom script blockchain analyzer
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:25:50
Looks like someone's gotten a bad case of the altcoins
@_date: 2015-06-10 07:47:19
Bitcoin really is like email in the 90's
@_date: 2015-06-18 06:03:12
Thanks, yea I guess it's too broad of a question. Thought maybe someone has a nice block analyzer or smth
@_date: 2014-11-13 11:53:26
That the price is going up? Or that it's time to blaze?
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:24:43
True that, unless I want to waste electrcity and gamble for the solo mining project but that's just stupid
@_date: 2014-11-22 00:22:10
Is it just me or there's no pay with bitcoin option
@_date: 2014-12-13 07:12:38
Imagine an asteroid with bitcoins from another dimension, i'd watch that movie

This guy is awesome. Vaporizers, Bitcoin and Nike shoes with screens, you can tell he is all about that disruptive technology
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:10:53
the dream is you can pay everyone in bitcoin, because it's stupidly easy to start accepting

MS is bigger than Google anyway, this is why. (sarc)

So  minecraft is now a succesful version of second life? Turning down graphics is one helluva weird move

As long as you have a visa/mastercard credit card it'll work. And you can then send bitcoins directly from circle either to where you need to send bitcoins or to your own wallet, if you prefer that
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:46:17
Oh ok. One helps to do your custom strategies the other has a fixed specific function. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-09 10:02:47
Good stuff. How did these companies ever got this amount of control is beyond me

The interviewer prolly needed a vacation after hearing so many "SAT words". I mean you can literally see the womans brain stop at 1.34-1.35

Europe will soon follow once the EUR goes below 1.0
@_date: 2015-01-08 10:56:45
What? They're claiming to mine bitcoin among other coins, and I think this is a con. Why would this be a wrong sub?
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:03:45
If you'd have accesss to at least one private key you could do something..
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:07:07
How do you know that? I couldn't find any specifics..
@_date: 2015-01-22 12:31:33
Makes sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-24 13:03:32
I think you mean the ECB
@_date: 2016-06-18 10:00:05
Except all the blocks are full, otherwise agreed
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:49:04
howcome the bitcoin days destroyed isn't spiking then?

I'm sure Karl Bez was riddiculed a lot more than this, when he started babbling about the horseless carriage

I've been waiting for a decentralized reddit for ages
@_date: 2015-04-08 07:44:12
Good job on getting the message through! Reddit can be tough
@_date: 2015-04-26 05:35:21
Thanks for the correction
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:42:52
Not really sure. But all the rest fits the bill. It's enforced on redditors who are not keeping to reddiquette, most commonly self promotion. This seems to be done by the admins, and trying to remove that status is pretty much futile
@_date: 2015-09-29 19:43:23
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:12:26
A very interesting read to say the least. Thank you

Not a 100% on this but I think most Ukrainians stopped using the banks when the currency went busto

I had to literally destroy my trezor box when I got it. No way of opening it without ruining the packaging
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:49:31
Cool, that's what I hoped to achieve. First heard about them when they were already going for 35$, didn't have much at the time got what I could. Got interested in minging, but wasn't as lucky as OP with my timing. Instead I got in at the very end when BFL GHs were already been taking preorders for a while. Would've been better of just buying, but still got the investment back some miraculous way. Also invested in a TerraMiner the one with 1.6THs, but that one now spends more than it makes like all the other equipment. Been buying some after have a bit left

I thought Andreas Antonopolous educated these grandpas on bitcoin, but all I hear is utter ignorance
@_date: 2015-10-14 07:47:44
The scams are always the same, it's the context that shifts

This thread made me wonder has anyone researched how many of "no-emails" policy companies survive or go under
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:15:16
This is very important as recently there was a story on how the RNG's can be manipulated to reveal even offline private keys (given the terminal is already compromised). Good read, Good idea. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:25:07
I saw it, it was well done and to my knowledge accurately described
