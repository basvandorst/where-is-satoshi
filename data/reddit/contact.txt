A bit off topic.. but thought I'd seize the opportunity to ask.
Why do random addresses have BTC dust deposited into them? What benefit could one possibly receive by sprinkling dust?
Thanks for the hard work you've done and I hope continue to do.. Sorry you're currently caught in the witch hunt.

He just really wanted his "STOP THE PRESSES!!" moment.

50 cent should change his name to 64 bit.

Umm.. no.
You've got that backwards. The way the iTunes store lets developers update apps and the way Apple allows access to certain levels of the OS is what makes it vulnerable (this maybe fixed in iOS7.. I can't comment on it). If an App developer wanted to go rogue and put a malicious update out there it wouldn't require any physical touching of the device. 
Sure you could install the wrong app on Android although it tells you pretty clearly what area of the OS/hardware it can touch before installation and if those areas change in an update then you would be prompted again.  There are also a lot more eyes looking at the Android code as it is open source.
We should just agree to disagree... I can already see where this conversation is headed.   Good luck in your box.

I'm by no means a new reddit account and can firsthand confirm this is true.. I had already completed the KYC process and successfully completed a few withdrawals before they came back with ridiculous questions before completing my last withdrawal (almost two months ago).
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:59:16
At least it's not a tank.

The best part is that he typed that into Reddit... King website for the socially awkward.

You sound ignorant.. Take a couple minutes to ponder why you're being downvoted.

Agree to disagree it is.

Washington DC isn't a state for this exact reason.

Can't wait to see everyone there.

You don't know what you're talking about..  The iPhone is the most hackable device.

I know they already offer service to Australia.. as that's where I live.  Too bad Coinbase doesn't.

I oddly enjoy seeing IT issues get fixed outside of ... Even better seeing it happen so quickly and in @_date: 2014-08-15 14:49:17
Count me in as well!

You need to make an international version that doesn't include coinbase.com as they are US only.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:48:38
This is assuming they don't lock you up.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:53:20
Thanks for the quick reply.

Can I deposit BTC and withdraw USD via wire transfer to a US bank account?
Congrats on the new features.. Keep up the great work!

I’d love to see it if you ever bring it to the Sydney Meetup!

I’m going to assume this Jeep was stolen by the BCH community.

He should probably check it while he's at it.. The circlejerk of hate is strong there.

You get my upvote.. Good luck!

Lean start-up, indeed.

Why would they have his address if he was the seller?  Buyers are the ones that provide the address.

Blockchain.info has an iPhone app that allows you to scan QR codes and send BTC payments, Apple be damned.

Liberty Reserve is Napster..  Bitcoin is Bit torrent.
It's the natural online evolution and hopefully Bitcoin isn't going anywhere due to it's lack of anything central to shutdown.

You don't really.. The rest of the world being sick of a artificially propped up US dollar as the standard would do the trick.

As someone who just move out of San Francisco.. $3k/mo isn't much.
@_date: 2013-06-25 04:42:32
Are they actual purchases? I would guess it's from mining pools growing and making micro payments out the the miners.
That would purely be a uneducated guess though.

I really wish the man wearing the BTC shirt was Tony Stark that was quoted later in the article.
@_date: 2013-07-17 11:13:58
Probably won't be much of a battle... Just buy the shirt before the cease and desist letters are sent out.
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:22:09
I'm saying that rent above $3k is common place for anything that has more than one bedroom and not in the Outer Richmond or Sunset.
Nothing in this post said anything about a one bedroom. This [article]( is from May 2013 and it's only gone up.

This is where the importance of using a escrow service for large transaction comes into play. Or at least a legally binding contract if the manufacturer needs you to loan them the money before they are providing product. 
Anything else is just a bad form of crowd sourcing.. it should be looked at as a high risk investment and you should be prepared to lose the money as a possibility.

I've been trying to buy from Coinbase for about two weeks now and they've been sold out everyday.
Am I doing something wrong?
@_date: 2013-07-17 11:15:58
I guess that would depend on the price of shipping... $45usd for a t-shirt just caught me off guard a bit. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 09:09:44
Love the shirt... Seems a bit pricey though.
@_date: 2013-07-29 09:07:59
Moved to Germany instead.

Your wallpapers are amazing! 
Any chance I could get the BTC wallpaper in green?
