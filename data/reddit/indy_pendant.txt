Alternatives are well and good, and I welcome them. However the point remains: a public blockchain will be used by the public for whatever anyone wants. The only way to prevent that is with a gatekeeper, and that destroys the best part of bitcoin.

I understand why he can't use bitcoin for his purposes, and for now, that's fine. We can offer a thimble, and needs a bathtub. But what about someone who only needs a thimble, but needs all of it? What then? Where's the room for us? If we're incapable of expanding capacity due to (granted: reasonable) demand, what good is it for us-the-majority?
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:14:54
And you might be missing my point. Corporations are going to use it in whatever capacity it exists in. If they decide to use all the throughput of Bitcoin, what does that leave us? Now it cost me an extra dollar or two to buy my Starbucks coffee. And really, there's nothing that we can do to stop it, because it is a decentralized, public technology. Whoever wants to use it, and whoever wants to use as much of it as they want, can. I want to make sure that there's always going to be space available for people like you and I to transact without having to pay restrictively high fees in order to do so.

That's a very narrow view you have, expecting corporations, or any other entity you disagree with, to not use a cheap, public, feely-accessible resource, and to avoid using it willingly without some gatekeeper entity enforcing it! What a utopian mindset. When that world comes to be, you let me know.
Until then, individuals, corporations, banks, and governments are free to use the blockchain for any damn reason they please without your approval, and the more they do, EITHER the more throughput we need OR the more it'll cost individuals like us to use, perhaps to the point that well a simply be priced out.  That's okay, though, PayPal's third-party solution will save us, I'm sure!

If you're treating it like a hot wallet, then that seems like a bad idea.  As a paranoid precaution, hot wallets shouldn't hold large amounts of BTC for long.  Cold storage or paper wallets are much preferred for keeping safe a lot of coins.  The problem is that a paper wallet is only considered "cold storage" as long as you never withdraw from it.  Once you make a withdrawl (which, and it should be repeated frequently, you always withdraw the TOTAL amount from a paper wallet), it is considered "hot."  I'm paranoid, so I take security very seriously.  In light of that, I should think a QR tattoo would be a bad investment, as, sooner or later, I would end up throwing away that address and creating replacements.
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:10:33
The reason that "banks are bad" is not because they provide security and accessibility to your funds.  Those are pretty good things, actually.  Ignoring plastic for a moment:
- If you get robbed, you're fucked.  Cash gone, untraceable, nothing you can do but cry.  If a bank gets robbed, its insured and you get your money back.
- If you want access to all your funds, you carry around a shitload of dollar bills on your person... or, with a bank, you draw cash out of an ATM as you need it, thus limiting your liability.
No, the reason we hate banks is because they lie, cheat, steal, break the law in every way possible, and not only do they get away with it, but they're practically rewarded by the government for doing so.  The Federal Reserve (a bank) prints $75bn every month and distributes it to the six major banks to invest as they see fit (Wall Street, yay), creating bubbles, inflating our currency, and overall fucking everyone over.  Even if a Bitcoin-bank did exist, they would have no ability at all to do this.  
(Also, I don't want to get into fractional reserve banking right now.)

That didn't make sense when I read it, but I decided to test that out today anyway.  I disabled my API key (it was enabled, I'm a developer), then reinstalled the CB Android app and set it up.  I then made a small purchase from my phone and went back to check the API key status on the website.  It was still deactivated.  This is as it should be, since the Android app uses OAuth instead of the API key.
@_date: 2014-07-23 23:04:46
Don't be sorry; what you stated doesn't make me wrong.  There is nothing intrinsically safer about CB than there was about MtGox.  You are giving your money to a company who promises to give it to you when you want it.  It's not *wrong* to trust CB to hold on to your finances and more than it was *wrong* to Gox, or me, or homeless Joe on the corner to do the same.  The only real difference is a matter of faith.
That said, my father, a retired construction worker who gets stumped when Internet Explorer isn't on the desktop, managed to print out a paper wallet (BIP38 encrypted, no less) and transfer his CB bitcoins into it for long term holding.  Copies of his wallet exist in his home safe, his safety deposit box, and my home safe.  My mother, myself, and he know the pass phrase.  
If *he* can do it, then I call bullshit on your "99.9% of people (who would use bitcoin) are not capable of securely storing their own money" statement.

Help me understand that?  You placed a PurseIO order for an AppleTV.  A user purchased it using a stolen credit card.  The Merchant got his money (because Amazon takes the hit for CC fraud), you got your product.  
Upon detecting the fraud, Amazon then contacted police to obtain the warrant, and sent them after you, the recipient of the items.
Is that correct?
Also, what exactly are they searching for / allowed to search for?  (I can't read german.)

Not at all; I'm a newbie.  There are two very good writeups here on explaining the process of setting up secure paper wallets.  If you asked me to explain Bitcoin, I don't think I could.  I could probably rattle off some bits about block chains, hashes, transaction verifications, but do I understand it?  Not really.  But can I create a truly "cold" paper wallet that I have 100% confidence in?  Absolutely!  And that took about an hour to learn...
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:11:37
As bitcoins are not an officially recognized currency, there are likely no regulations covering returns.  I should think that means that a merchant wouldn't even have to offer a return policy when selling via bitcoins, or if they did, the policy would be completely up to the merchant.

I'm sure a browser plugin would be a quick-n-dirty way to get it done.  Anything built into the Facebook experience directly, no, not without FB getting on board.
Actually, thinking just a little bit more, if apps are still able to get permissions to read all of your posts, that could be an app integration point.  The app could periodically scan all of your posts, look for the /tip, act on it, and even reply like they do here in Reddit.
Yes.  Yes, it's possible.
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:15:56
No.  If the API key isn't activated (by default, it's not), then in all likelihood they're fine.  Of course, a few things to mention:
- They should absolutely enable 2FA for everything possible.
- Use strong passwords.  "bOoTs1995" is a bad password.  "I really like to pet my cat." is a fantastically strong password.
- If you're going to be storing BTC for a long time (investment asset, rather than using it as a daily currency), paper wallets are pretty much the end-all-be-all in bitcoin security.   is an all-client-side account and wallet generate site.  Use that on an offline computer to generate and print BIP38 encrypted paper wallets, and dump the funds from Coinbase into there.

There's not as big a disconnect between those two scenarios as you seemingly believe.
[Relevant XKCD](
Databases are compromised.  Data gets leaked.  If even an encrypted version of the passwords gets into the wild, then having a strong password is the only thing that keeps your information sense.
In [this experiment]( white-hat hackers were able to able to figure out up to 90% of the passwords stored, encrypted, in a fictionally-compromised database.  "Our goal is to find the most plains in the least amount of time, so we want to find as much low-hanging fruit as possible first."  That's why passwords like "Apr!l221973" will do you no good if the DB is compromised, while "I ate skittles for breakfast." could keep you safe a good while longer.

From reading past reports, it's unclear.  The users state that they were 100% safe and secure, no viruses, no cached pages, nothing that would leak their API key.  Coinbase has typically no comment.  So, who knows?
Personally, I expect that if this were Coinbase's fault (as in, there was a flaw in their security that allowed people to steal others' API keys), then we would have seen a lot more thefts.

For long-term storage (not daily use), you'll want to read everything you can about "paper wallets."  But, in short:
- Download bitaddress.org (yes, the webpage) to a thumb drive.  
- Boot up an offline computer, preferably using an Ubuntu-bootable cd/usb.
- Open up your saved bitaddress.org webpage, and generate a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet.
- Print out a few copies; one to keep secure in your home, one to keep secure outside your home (relative's house, safety deposit box, etc)
- Put the password to your paper wallet in your will, or leave it with a TRUSTED person.  (In case you die, someone needs to have access to your funds, or they're gone forever.)
That's about as secure as you can possibly be.

In considering building/modifying a website to start taking BTC as payment, I found that both Coinbase and Blockchain have APIs that will do everything necessary.  I intend to hold/spend BTC, as opposed to immediately transferring it into USD.
Is there a reason, or an opinion, to chose one over the other, either from an API point of view, or from a hot-wallet point of view?
(I've already read up on cold storage, paper wallets, and have gone through many "practice runs" of each to ensure to myself that I'm using them properly.  That shouldn't factor too heavily into your opinion.)

If the block size (number of txns per block) cannot grow, and the block addition rate (the number of blocks we process per period) cannot grow, then the only thing left is the time for transactions time (how long a txn must wait before it gets added to a block) goes up as the number of transactions per period increases.

Well, no, you only realize a loss or gain if you sell out at that price.  Anyone who wants to take that loss is welcome to, but shouldn't bitch about something they do voluntarily.  The highest I bought in is $850.  Now that it's in the $400s, I bought more, decreasing my average cost to (at last calc) $502 per btc.
No loss realized.  Quite content.  :)

Sorry, this seems like an issue of semantics more than a correction.
Fed says "I'm printing money and I'm going to give it to the banks" and buys the securities from the banks because, well, the Fed is the Bank of banks.  New money is created (ew, Keynesian).  The banks do "as they see fit" because their goal is to make a profit on that $75bn, so the vast majority goes into Wall Street.  The banks might eventually pay back that $75bn, but the money is still being printed out of nothing and creating bubbles and inflating the currency etc.

The "fraud" is that people create Purse accounts en mass, "buy" a lot of items and put in fake Amazon Order IDs to "prove" they ordered it, and hope that gullible users, like myself, will release the BTC without waiting for receipt of the package.  It costs them nothing, but it means that my Buy Order has been up for nearly a month due to frauders blocking the way for legitimate users.
As for Purse's escrow, only once were my BTC given to the "Buyer" who didn't deserve it.  It was extenuating circumstances, but the Admin who oversaw the situation didn't understand what was going on when he gave my money away.  After a lot of shouting on the Purse help message, on here, and on it eventually got rectified.

Blockchain is the appropriate term for what you're using it as, yes.  :)  As for a push to secure voting, I haven't seen much of one, nor do I think it'd take root in the US; at least, not soon.

I'm in a similar, though not entirely equal, situation.  My retirement plan is threefold, and I'll be happy to share:
1) Bitcoins.  I believe in the technology, not the currency; however, I think the tech will drag the currency along with it and be a major cause of it's adoption.  I consider it a risky investment.
2) World Dominator Dividend stocks.  Companies like IBM, McDonalds, Nestle, who will likely survive even if the United States collapsed economically overnight.  They pay out regular and increasing dividends and through reinvesting (DRIPs or otherwise) can total a tidy sum come 65.
3) Whole life insurance.  I'm lazy, [click here]( for why it's useful and better than term.

Help me understand a little more, then.  I know that CB/BitPay are exchanges and offer that service.  They also hold your bitcoins "for you" while Blockchain doesn't keep your private keys.  Given that I don't need an exchange service (or, if I did, I could xfer then sell), is there any reason to use one of them?
As far as I understand, to accept bitcoins for payment, I need to:
- On the fly, create a payment address, one that has a monitoring system hooked up and will call back to my webserver when money is received.
- Monitor transactions for number of confirmations.
...  I think that's it.  Am I missing anything?

There isn't, but that's a fantastic idea.  I'll see about having one made in the near future.  (Any sort of video production is well outside my area of expertise.)  Thank you for the suggestion!
The lowest Wishlist amount is presently $15, but this can vary as the Merchant's inventory changes.
You don't use Amazon gift cards *on* my site.  Instead, you would use those giftcards on Amazon.com to apply credit to your account, then use that credit to purchase the Wishlist given to you by my site.  Does that make sense?

Amazon varies in how long it takes to report back to the Merchant that a sale has been completed, and they, in turn, vary in how long they take to ship.  I can't track those numbers precisely, so I cant get to-the-minute accuracy.  According to my logs, though, every transaction that has completed today looks like they have been *less than two hours* from purchase to payout.

Think of it this way, 1 BTC is still worth 1 BTC.  The "price" is only compared to other fiat currencies, and is relevant (yes, it is relevant) so long as we can't complete the currency-use loop.  As long as folks are slowly plugging away at creating a BTC economy, we'll eventually get to the place where the "price" of BTC is meaningless as the "price" of a dollar.  :)

I'm not part of the Facebook generation, and anonymity for my clients and users are of utmost importance.

I wrote software that lets cooperating Amazon Merchants send anonymized notifications when they ship a product.  They include the Amazon Order ID, item IDs, and anonymized Client ID; no personal information is ever shared with Amazon 2 Bitcoin.  (It's not even a matter of we *won't* share your information; we literally *can't*.)  Once all the items on the Wishlist have been marked as Shipped, the system automatically sends Bitcoins from the hot-wallet directly to your bitcoin wallet.  Done and done, simple as that.  :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:30:47
I think you're almost entirely correct, and as with any CC system, there's bound to be carders.  I sincerely hope it's that sub-1% that Purse claims, but like you, I have no real information.  I likely never will; as you said, Amazon abstracts all that from us.
Unlike Purse, Amazon 2 Bitcoin users only get to see the city and state of the recipient, *not* the name.  (This has been obfuscated by an ID# that I use with my clients.)  So, there's that minor improvement.


A small correction:  I (and these sites) would potentially profit from *carders* by Amazon / CC companies assuming the fraud, to compensate for which Amazon and CC companies take a fee (Amazon: 6%-30%, depending on items being sold; ~3% for CC companies).  I (and these other sites) profit from *legitimate* users with zero risk to either of these companies, yet they still take their cut.  It's Business 101, right?  Insurance.  Mitigate big losses by collecting a little profit from everyone.
The second point, though, I agree with you, is the more pertinent one, and I'll give it to you straight: As a Purse user myself, I was really scared to see someone get raided by the cops, allegedly over a Purse purchase.  "Holy shit, when are they going to come knocking at my door?" was my gut reaction.  After the shock and awe wore off, I re-evaluated it with a critical eye.
So far, that's only happened once that we've heard about, and in Germany.  I imagine they deal with things a little differently over there.  ;)  I believe in doing the right thing, and if I legitimately believe there's a threat to my clients' customers (who receive the goods ordered via my site), I'll pay off every current order and pull the plug on my site that same day.  I don't have investors who need a return, and I don't have business loans to pay off.  This is a project I did because I could; I saw something wrong with Purse and Brawker, and I knew I could do better.
Thank you, sincerely, for your feedback.  I appreciate you taking the time.  It helps me solidify my own views and plans for if things do go wrong.

In my experience with Purse (about a dozen transactions, I would guess), I would say it's *mostly* safe.

@_date: 2015-01-22 07:19:10
Scammers and Carders are two different things.  The scammers I found were trying to get Bitcoin from me without actually buying the order, or by buying and then quickly cancelling the order.  [Amazon 2 Bitcoin]( (shameless plug) doesn't have that problem at all, as the transactions aren't peer-to-peer, for one, and, two, are automated to pay only when the Wishlist is completely shipped.  :)  It's designed to be a better experience.
I can observe the sale in as much as I have access to my clients' Amazon sales/orders reporting that tells me which items were shipped, when they are shipped, and to which ID# they were shipped to.  As far as whether a sale eventually gets marked as fraud for stolen credit cards or something like that, I don't have any of that information and, from my limited experience selling on Amazon, I don't think Merchants have that information either. 
It's a learning experience all-around.  Anything I find out, I'll gladly share with :)

Short/partial answer:  The war over oil right now is causing a bit of panic in the world, and panic traditionally makes nations purchase USD for security (as it is the world currency, though for how much longer is anyone's guess).  Purchasing USD makes it a stronger currency, and worth more, thus by comparison, BTC is worth less since it moves independently of USD.

Honestly, I couldn't care less if they're used predominantly by carders.  I'd just be really surprised since PurseIO is only really advertised/talked about on Bitcoin news sites and Reddit.  That would represent a *huge* overlap of carders and Bitcoin enthusiasts/users, and I would find that very interesting.  However, it doesn't exactly ring true to me, so I doubt the veracity of the claim.

You're absolutely right; paypal -&gt; BTC is *extremely* dangerous.

The problem is that stating thresholds like this world commit them to action, and that's the opposite of what they want. See, it's become a political, almost religious war now, where loyalty and the appearance of strength is more important than anything else. Sticking to The Roadmap in the face of all opposition, demand, request, or reasoning is akin to an unwavering faith in the holy, and to stray for any reason other than divine proclamation would cause unwanted ripples in the faithful masses.  Just as the old Catholic priesthood were the gatekeepers to God, the Core retains power largely through smoke and mirror tactics (censorship, strawman arguments, heretic labeling) and the blind faith (Core vs the unwashed heathens) of followers.

If you want anonymity in your bitcoins, then you'll have to look outside the exchanges.  They're regulated by the government and require your information.
You can try localbitcoins or Mycelium trader if you're interested in doing in-person deals.  There are also online services that you can use to obtain bitcoins anonymously, such as [Amazon 2 Bitcoin]( or Purse.  These use a 3rd party intermediary to purchase bitcoins (at a variable premium) and you remain completely anonymous.

It seems to me that if they were in serious jeopardy of paying out $10k very often, they wouldn't have offered it at all.  (Maybe I'm just cynical, though.)  In my view, that offer was a bit of good PR (which they desperately need!) that will likely get taken up very, very rarely.

Well, see, that's the politics.  That's what so funny.
If you're on one side, these are genuine problems.  Some wallets don't calculate fees correctly, some people don't know how to calculate fees correctly, and this causes Bitcoin to be cumbersome and unusable by a large percentage of users.
If you're on the other side, these are all coordinated attacks against the credibility and leadership of the Core Team, and the fact that fees are rising is a really good thing.
What's the truth?  Are people actually unable to effectively use Bitcoin, or are things actually going really really well for the Bitcoin ecosphere?  Hah, I dunno, but seeing the whole thing corrupted by the stain of politics and Us vs Them mentality is ...  well, it's so very human.  :-D

No...  you don't support non-Featured Merchants.  If there was a refurbished item for sale by a Featured Merchant, Purse would support it.  (I have a good idea how the code works.  I wrote a clone of it months back, except I found a way to support all merchants.)  
Items you don't support are, for example:
- a unique piece of art or jewelry that's not sold in bulk by a major seller,
- an item that is marked "New" and is cheaper than the "Buy It Now" price,
- anything from a specific merchant that you want to support and buy from who doesn't happen to win the Amazon Featured Merchant lottery,
- oh, and gift cards, the single biggest selling item on Purse.  That's another issue all together, though.

An app that supports HD Wallets (like Mycelium) will give you a unique address for every transaction.  This is (I believe) the safest way to use Bitcoin for day-to-day operations.

This is a subjective statement, despite the claim.  As a programmer, I find SW very interesting, and potentially a good idea that should be studied more before implemented.  Regardless, neither it "fast" nor "safe" I'd attribute.  From an engineering perspective, it's a massive, high risk code change.  This *should* take a long time, with lots of review, lots of testing. Fast-tracking a change like this is a terrible idea from people who don't understand good engineering principles.  From a political perspective, I feel like its "need" is closely tied to the "need" for RBF, a highly-contentious and disruptive BIP that solves the problem for a very powerful few by creating potential problems for the voiceless many.  Security-thinking, we all have one basic fear: centralization.  Anti-Classic (because I'm going to be equally political here) proponents are scared that Big Blocks will create a technological centralization.  I don't buy this, because I see who the opponents are, and see that 2MB would be a minor blow against decentralization that would be overcome within six to twelve months just due to the nature of technology and the economic conditions in nations like China.  Anti-Core proponents fear the centralization of development, unilateral decision as to where and why bitcoin develops.  This is where I fall, and this is something I feel is extremely "unsafe."  So, long story short, SW is not "objectively the fastest and safest proposal."


This statement is 100% opinion, and a direct appeal to emotion.  Our "most trusted and valuable" political figures, for example, are still doing quite a lot to screw over folks like you and I, friend, so lending them an air of credibility based on personal feelings does no one any good.  The Core team has done a lot for us, and hopefully will continue to do so in the future.  This does not mean that they are infallible or incorruptible.  As I've said before, when a side starts to use political patriotism, censorship, and fear tactics to forward their goals, their agendas and motivations need to be scrutinized.


In engineering, we have two principle means of "scaling:"  1) Changing code to be more efficient, 2) throwing more resources at it.  Despite the initial emotional reaction against  both are valid and worth-while means of responding to demand.  In fact, Amazon Web Services bases their whole infrastructure on it.  When demand increases, for example, AWS will rapidly spin up new machines to handle the load.  Increasing block size is an equivalent.  It's low risk (technologically speaking), and (aside from hard-fork fears, which, really, we've gone through a hard fork before, and if it were pushed through with the same fervor and unanimity, we shouldn't have to fear future forks) extremely safe, and very fast to do.  Does this eliminate the need for a  solution, something akin to SW?  No, but neither does having a code change eliminate the need for expanded resources.  They are *not* mutually exclusive, despite what bitcoin political patriots would have us believe.

I don't know conclusively. We've had a few reports of being tracked for two hops, but I've never seen anything claiming more. CB doesn't actually care where you send your coins, but they have to follow government regulations. How those regulations are implemented, though, no one knows exactly.
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:13:59
Thinking a for-profit like CB cares where you send your coins isn't rational either. They're required to comply with government regulations, but how those regulations are applied to blockchain transactions, no one here has ever started with conclusive authority. People have been penalized for sending to gambling/drug destination addresses after two hops, but so far, that's the only evidence we've seen.
Remember, while CB has to follow the rules, they aren't a tracking/forensics company. Like most corps, I'm sure they're doing the least-costly practice to comply with government mandates.

I'm inclined to believe you over OP for two reasons:
- I have you res-tagged as "Good Mod"
- When I was unemployed (yay, game dev industry!) I had a short contract to do something like this years and years ago (nothing to do with Bitcoin).  Our "mission statement" was nothing like this pseudo-government dribble posted by OP.  We sat in cubicles, ate Taco Del Mar for lunch, and tried not to get caught playing games on the clock.  We most certainly did not have Operation names and bullshit like that.  :)

Depends on what your goal is.  If it's just to escape their government mandated tracking, you can send it along from address to address X times (where X is, at best guess, three or more).  They're still "your coins," but they've passed the number of "hops" that CB is required to monitor, and thus, they don't care.
That's the theory anyway.  :)

Having started small businesses myself, I know customer service isn't easy.  Most of the time, it's handled (at the beginning) by the developers or business owners themselves, and we're rarely cut out for that.  Because of this, I try to give companies slack.
Each of those companies I've mentioned, though, took all that slack I offered, and a bit more.  ie: A Purse admin screwed up (it may have been due to his lack of English comprehension, but I'm not sure), and accidentally stole my bitcoins and gave them to someone else.  I submitted a ticket and waited, and waited, but nothing came of it.  I posted to Reddit, and it was fixed that day.  :-/  CB.info closed a ticket, completely unanswered, after eight days. I re-opened with a "threat" of "Do only complaints posted to Reddit get answered?" and it was addressed that day.
Rightly or not, these companies care more about reputation than customer service, and as intelligent consumers, we have to make use of that.  :-/  C'est la vie, no?

Can you explain how that works?  How can you see your vote be tallied properly *without* anyone else knowing it's your vote?

Dumbest poster ever.
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:02:16
Help me along with this.  It seems to me that there are two things that I, personally, need to be able to do to ensure valid voting:
1) Verify that my vote was recorded correctly.
2) Verify that all votes were tallied correctly.
One-way hashes allow me to take my secret information (like a private key) and release a public, uniquely identifiable version of it (like a public address).  As long as that public information is marked in the ledger with how my vote was cast, then  is satisfied.
As long as there is a public ledger, where I can view all votes that were cast (alongside the public information, as mentioned above), then I can count myself and verify the tally.  This satisfies point number two.
I'm sure there are things I'm not considering, but that's why I'm starting the discussion.  :)
@_date: 2015-11-08 01:26:54
Tell me about the audit.  How can I *know*  that this old lady's vote was actually recorded accurately, and know that it got tallied, while still remaining completely unaware of how she voted?
@_date: 2015-11-08 04:00:50


Sure, but it's all just opinions.  Without an actual "perfect" system, we're trading off one bit of bad for another different bit.
Of course it's easy for me:
One one hand, we cast a secret ballot and throw it into an incinerator, trusting the voting machine and the human black-box system after it to all be honest, despite the decades of evidence to the contrary.
On the other hand, someone could potentially know (or, in the hostage scenario, force) my vote, but it would be difficult, yet the entire voting process is otherwise free from fraud and black-box "trust me" systems.
No contest.  :-/
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:49:00
Noooo, I'm saying what *my* preference would be.  I also prefer chocolate to vanilla, if you're interested.
That said, why would one person's wish to have a secret ballot outweigh another's wish to have the vote actually, provably counted in an election?  I mean, we know for certain that votes (in the US) currently don't matter (thanks Diebold!).
What we have now is a system where the very computers used in elections are rigged to change and mis-record the votes.  It's been demonstrated time and time again.  Do we give up electronic voting entirely?  Well, no, because then we trust the human computer ("Hanging Chads") which is just as fallible.  We *need* something else, even if it's not perfect.

Will there be an exchange fee for using this card in a foreign country (MX, SO, etc)?
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:53:31
I see.  So, this assumes that 1) you cannot see into the box (because if you could, you could track another person's vote, thus eliminating the secrecy) and that 2) even though you cannot see inside the box during voting, you can inspect the box before and after to ensure no hankey-pankey.
I get it.
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:00:13
The major downside the the traditional system is, of course, it's impossible to verify your vote was 1) recorded correctly, or 2) tallied at all.  I understand the worst-case-scenario you're explaining, but I think that the potential-problem is better than the actual-problem of voting now.
Hell, if someone gave me $100, I'd probably vote for Trump.  Why?  Because I know my vote won't actually be recorded or tallied anyway.  Neither system will fix the "buy my vote" scenario, so...  yeah, lets go with the blockchain system, right?
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:35:27
The short answer is that the owners would die of old age many times over before they found a single address with a balance; there are that many (and many more) possible addresses.
@_date: 2015-11-08 01:26:03
I see your point, and I understand the purpose and important of secret ballots.  The problem is, of course, that secret ballots can't be secured against fraud on behalf of the trusted talliers.  (Hanging chad?)
I still think I'd rather trade systems.  I would rather be able to prove to myself that *my* vote was correctly recorded and tallied (provided that it's "hard" for someone else to do the same, even if it's not impossible.  I mean, if we're being honest, it's not impossible now when using voting machines) than to know that my vote is secret, but didn't actually make it to the tallying boards.  (The black-box aspect removes any reliability.)

Thank you for the resources!  I downloaded bitcoind source last night, but haven't hand a chance to compile / look through it.  The bitcoinj looks interesting too.  I've got quite a lot of research to do, but it certainly seems like something I can achieve in my spare time.
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:25:25
Bitcoin is a container of value (and, no, I'm not going to touch on the "intrinsic value" argument).  That value fluctuates, thus it is an agent of investment.  It also happens to be an extremely mobile container, meaning it can transfer ownership safely and quickly, thus it is an agent of currency.
What it is depends entirely on how you use it.
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:04:05
Have you ever attempted that?  I haven't looked at the source code yet.  I'm curious if it's relatively simple, or an undertaking that'll take all my nights and weekends for the next month.

I've been having issues with the callback not being called with all the query parameters.  As in their example, they include a ?secret=foo token to the callback URL, and I followed suit, yet the callbacks are made 92% of the time (23/25) without the $_GET['secret'] being set.
@_date: 2015-02-06 21:03:54
Again, depends on the number of hops they care about. If your coins stay in the tumbler, getting mixed and remixed, then it could potentially get past the maximum hop check.
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:14:29
Coinbase keeps tumblers relevant.  Tumblers are what, roughly 2-3% fee?  Added to Coinbase, and now you've got a 3-4% fee for doing business, and you've gotta go through two trusted parties in order to get your coins.

That's a good reference, but I haven't yet had the chance to see if it's a proper two-of-three where I'm the sole holder of two keys. If it's not, then they're no better than CB or any other hosted wallet, ya know?

It depends on how many hops Coinbase cares (or is forced to care) about.  Obviously they aren't stopping at one hop, directly from Coinbase.  Would they care about three hops?  Ten?  If all you get from Tumblers is enough hops away from Coinbase that they no longer care, then that's probably worth it.
From the laws I have looked at, I've seen nothing that would require them, or anyone, to care about transactions more than one hop away from the MSB.  Coinbase reps are free to correct me on this, but holding Bob responsible for what Carol or Dan do with coins after they receive them is fucking stupid.

@_date: 2015-02-06 22:43:29
That's what this story seems to indicate, though, doesn't it?  If true, this means that Coinbase is tracking for at least two hops.  Realistically, of course you're not responsible for what the recipient of your money does with it next.  But Coinbase (perhaps through legal requirements, perhaps not) says you are...

Is there a public network that you can connect to?  Also, it seems very low level.  Not a bad thing, but if I want to send 1.0 BTC to an address, it looks like I need to track down all my own addresses and add up the balances before I can make a Transaction.  I guess I was hoping for a "Wallet" option that has some of this groundwork already done, rather than messing with individual addresses.  :-/
