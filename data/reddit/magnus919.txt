Since the "news" is little more than propaganda for wealthy power brokers, it makes one wonder if modern media moguls are heavily invested in Bitcoin futures.

send a donut!
Add "sex" to things you can buy with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:39:11
"Their" coins? They give up that claim the moment they sell.

I got it and watched it. Thanks.

Oh, absolutely. I get it. I got it when I sent the donut. But a sex worker that understands and uses Bitcoin as part of managing her business overhead is one that is more likely to happily accept it as payment. I guess that was the point I was trying to make.

I'm relatively new to Bitcoin, having made my first purchase *of* Bitcoin about a month ago, my first purchase *with* Bitcoin about a week after that. I started out with Circle, and it works alright.
A friend suggested that I try Coinbase. The amount of access they wanted to my bank information was unsettling. After vetting them out and proceeding, I made a purchase and it was not clear until after the purchase was made that I'd have to wait a week to get the Bitcoin that I just purchased. All in all this left me feeling underwhelmed by the experience.

It's all a matter of context.
If you're a Western software engineer that makes US$100,000+ salary per year, then no, this isn't going to be significant.
If Bitcoin is going to take off as a global currency, though, we must be aware of the burdens imposed upon the least of us. 15 cents in some societies might mean the difference between eating or not.

Sweet! send a donut!

It's pretty clear to people who are already established in the community, yes. But it's not really clear to someone new and experiencing this for the first time.
Unfortunately, Coinbase did not offer to send me BTC instantly via credit card until *after* I'd completed my end of the transaction. Adding my credit card did nothing to speed things up. It also took close to a week to confirm the credit card in their system. So now, a week later, I'm finally set for instant transactions with Coinbase. But the initial transaction was unpleasant.

Glad to see Cuba joining this next generation global economy. And I hope someday soon our respective governments get over themselves enough to allow me to come visit your beautiful country. Here's a little bit to spread around to help demonstrate Bitcoin to others. send cerveza.

I buy a lot of used books for my ~~basement~~library, more than I can keep up with reading. I usually pay less than $5 a piece, and it's for books that I've carefully selected and really want to read. Good luck with this, but I'm having a hard time seeing the value.

That argument may make the use of bits a sane default, but for the user of the wallet it really ought to be up to their personal choice how to display the contents of their own wallet.
I'm a fairly new user myself, and I'm mostly enjoying Breadwallet. Almost nobody that I'm engaging in transactions with is using bits so it's making adoption of Bitcoin by me more complicated than it needs to be. Sure, I can do the math in my head. But I'd rather just sync up to whatever units the other party is using to remove all doubt.
Side note: I've got a couple of transactions from donations I've made to tip jars over 24 hours ago, still have 0 confirmations. I'm up to date on my software. I've read elsewhere that the size of the fee attached is too small so confirmation gets deferred. Is there anything to that? Example: I sent about 80,000 bits to Overstock over 12 hours ago, 0 confirmations. 18,000 bits to a tip jar over 24 hours ago, 0 confirmations (but another tip of equal size sent 5 minutes sooner went through within an hour or so).

I think that's just to stream it. $6 to stream a smalltime documentary is crazy.

What about all of those people in Greece who don't have access to their money, but keep hearing about this Bitcoin thing? Would you begrudge them a little pseudo-theft to escape the situation they're in?

That exchange rate smells rapey.
@_date: 2015-07-25 11:06:26
I agree. Once I have Bitcoin, it's proving to be very easy to use, to move around, to spend (among those who will accept it as payment).

For those who looked at the chart and, like me, had no idea what it meant:

Thanks for posting an honest review. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:38:13
Doubtful. These buyers are people that don't care about altcoin. They care about business continuity. Bitcoin is the liferaft in front of them now for business continuity.

I only know of one BTC ATM and it's in Chapel Hill (which is tucked in far corner of the Triangle, so it's not very central at all). I've not been able to spend BTC over the counter anywhere yet.
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:50:03
I think if I had one, it wouldn't last long before I found something to spend it on.

So I have to use my secure digital currency to buy a gift card to a store, and use the gift card to buy my goods? Is that how it works? I was excited at first, misled into thinking I could use Bitcoin directly with their POS systems.

I'm having a hard time figuring out where I can get this movie:
* paid for with BTC
* downloaded, not streamed
* in a common, DRM-free format
TheProtocol.TV, as best as I can tell, is charging for streaming. There is a price for it and it's asking me to pay before it's really telling me anything about what I'm paying for.
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:35:01
Pay *for what*, though? There is a price but it's not telling me anything about whether that's a price for streaming the film, downloading the film, or something else entirely.

The first bitcoin-for-goods transaction was 10,000BTC for 2 pizzas, delivered. I'll let you do the math.

With all of the tech startups in and around American Tobacco Campus, there should (at the very least) be a Bitcoin ATM on-campus. It'd be baller if all of the restaurants &amp; shops here would accept it, like an island of Bitcoin acceptance.

Yep, [media mail]( will save over normal shipping rates, but will cut into the value proposition bigtime. When shipping rates are high, a better approach might be to find a value proposition that places more books in each shipment (to cut down the cost of shipping per book).

My employer just got bought out by a bigger company. The healthcare coverage for the bigger company costs me more out of pocket, and I'm now finding it is poorer at covering the healthcare needs of my child with a chronic illness. I understand the motivation of the author and empathize with his family.

No idea, man. I don't do business with them; I didn't like their terms of service so I went elsewhere.
