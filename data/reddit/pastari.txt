Lots of talk for months (years) with no tangible results to the end user. 
So, to the average user, it doesn't *feel* like progress is being made. They don't care if improvements are going to be released tomorrow or in six months--until it's in their hands and improves they're experience, it might as well not exist.

Yeah that's not how it works. 
You know those signs in parking lots that say "We're not liable for anything that happens to your car" or the signs on the back of big trucks that say "stay back-not liable for chipped windshields" ?
They're most likely liable. Be it insufficient lightning in the parking lot leading to break ins, or negligence leaving loose large rocks on top of the truck. (They'll even have insurance to cover these claims!)
If they avoid a *single* person harassing them because that person read a sign and was like "well they said they're not liable, guess I'm fucked" then any signage has already paid for itself.

No purchase necessary. 
I've been following both supporters and detractors of cryptocurrency just from the sidelines since BTC was in the low hundreds. The theory, story lines, and (lets be honest) drama are enough to keep it entertaining. I've learned an incredible amount across a very wide variety of topics while being insulated from volatility and keeping an even emotional keel. There is no way I could maintain an open mind towards so much information if I had any skin in the game. 
Economics, cryptography, computer science, international law, history, sociology, psychology, I could keep going...
As a no-coiner, I thank you.

If the US defaults on its loans then you've got far more to worry about than your 2.145% APR investment.

My amex is clear and my amazon visa is bright green. I get comments on both regularly.

And international headquarters for IBM, Cisco, GSK etc.

With a projected **$1bil** in VC money for this year, what's the problem with $5k plus lawyer fees? 
Also, I've never seen a dollar amount specified to a tenth of a cent before. Is that supposed to make the number look bigger than it is?

Which part of bitlicense has regulators pointing guns at people applying? I think I missed that part.

Something something graphite dust floating around.

When I moved, I had to get adapter thingies from the Subaru dealership for my front plate. The holes are spaced for the Japanese plates, even for vehicles destined for the US market.
Judging by other peoples' mounting jobs, I think I can safely say that front plates are a PITA for a lot of vehicles.

Last time I needed a copy, I went to kinkos, put my amex in the machine, made one copy, it charged my card, and I left. It was less than seventeen cents. 
I imagine a fax would have worked the same way.

Indeed normal, because what you actually want to look at in this context is mean.
The median would only significantly change if everyone stopped using dynamic fees or there were several block times &gt;10m in succession.

Whoa there.
