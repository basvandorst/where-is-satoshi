If it's treated like personal property, there's no difference between a lawyer losing a platinum ring in transit vs. a website being broken into. To be fair, malpractice insurance is a different beast than your typical underwriting. Essentially the users would need to file their claim against the operating firm and obviously the insurer would fight a payout stating a number of grounds. 
That still protects against negligent handling of funds (Gox), and still offers at least the possibility of a recovery if the exchange was compromised.

To be clear this is a confirmed way to keep out bad actors. As for the mechanism that the malpractice insurer would want to be put in place may be pretty extraordinary. Just speaking from experience, one large firm had a few hundred million in USD available at any second of client funds held in trust. Any signer on the account (I'm sure the firm had internal procedures on withdrawal) could hike over to the bank and make that check payable to anyone they wanted. There hasn't been a difference with the fluidity of client funds in trust working in smaller firms or as a solo practicioner, the only real difference is when you check the account balance you only need to account for a few hundred thousand to a few million dollars. I doubt a state bar would let an insurer have any access to client funds as the lawyer has the ultimate responsibility. The security of the exchange is obviously the most important aspect, I'm only exploring adding an additional level of credibility/security that is clearly lacking. If the folks at Gox walk away with a few billion there's not much that can be done to recover any of those funds.
