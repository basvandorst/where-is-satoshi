So say that I should be careful before making any major purchases.  The point is they don't ask for any money from me.  What I have to lose here? 
Have you looked into the website?

This can be a sales tricks but how do I know they have a legitimate business?  Can’t see the farm as it’s based in Japan. 
No they aren’t asking any money from me, and I can pay from the sales profit 5o%  towards the ownership of the front end sales. 
Do you think asking for the ffinancial data about the businesss will help?

If don't have money to lose and can pay from the profit percentage, what should I be afraid of than only wasting 4 hours per day?  May have a look into the site and tell me if this is any good?

I don't understand what you are trying to warn me as they don't ask any money from me in the first place.

They mention to me that they only mine BTC now and will purchase the machinery in the future to mine other coins. So, I believe the claim is not incorrect but the way I have expressed it. This is the website the we are talking: [
It feels to me legit business but What do you think about this? 
  
Also, lastly, I negotiated that I don't make any upfront investment but only return 50 - 75% of the profit recurrently until fulfilling the business valuation and only they will handover the license and domain name to me.  The business is based in Japan and we have a good vibe in the negotiation.

They are now not asking for any money from me and I can pay them from the 50% of the sales profit. I will ask for financial data before signing a contract though.
