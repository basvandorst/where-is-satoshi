FUD. Never looked so shilled.
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:46:38
You need some SAR's and SMA's and BB's on that chart. Holy fook that is some bad timing.
@_date: 2017-02-06 15:48:22
Obviously that will cause a spike on the chart. However the hedging will do more for the price in the long run.
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:31:34
Never saw anything more accurate. The downward slopes are profit taking from shorters, and the rise is from the market cap, and coin supply. Well made. 10/10.

IS THIS CHINA? LOL
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:17:58
New base at 1000? possible.
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:34:37
HODL! and relax people who are not used to this volatility. This type of flux is normal plus or minus 15-30% change in price has always been the norm. The market is not crashing. Bitcoin has never been stronger see you peeps at 2000.

If ETF gets approved which I think it will BTC will fly.
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:27:51
Good stuff. I forget the beat it is based off, please remind me OP.
@_date: 2017-02-03 06:23:08
Bitcoin went on a bull run because of China; then it dropped down to pre-run levels. During the run it built support at the 1000's. After the run it bottomed out at support. The next run is going to be higher than the previous peak. I am going to take a wild guess and say that it may drop again around previous peak price level however if it continues the momentum in volume it could not drop at all.
@_date: 2017-02-06 06:03:00
300 million isn't that much but since there will be hedging the number of coins available would be less so it will probably go up because of supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:38:50
Universal currency inbound Bitcoin is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:55:31
Yep. That sums it up well. BTU is a marketing scheme to take over the network. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:22:18
You can say demand is a boomin
@_date: 2017-03-22 05:21:32
The fact that BU is overly hyped goes to show that in reality it is not a good solution to the scaling problem.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:54:12
It's as if the BU dev team is an advertising agency selling shady supplements.

Don't trust zerohedge, they have been wrong before.
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:30:27
Unless it is something backed by colored coins; so no. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 05:20:11
It is very true. The interest rates for savings accounts suck even if its  a CD. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:27:55
LOL. Do the opposite. The author took a short position. March is going to be a great month for BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-14 04:29:16
I think people are falling for cloud mining because they are new to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:06:18
2000 USD+ is expected however it might fluctuate 15-30% as it usually does. Once momentum starts building people will ride along. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:56:34

ZH is a shitty news website; that uses its authority to profit from market fluctuation. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:41:08
with bitcoin price is a function of time

Sheep get slaughtered. xd.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:29:16
So far alts pump every 6 months. Meanwhile BTC pumps every 3-6 months. But ur right the reason alts pump is b/c of the flow of BTC into the BTC pairs.
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:49:38
Ooofff... all those butt hurt BCash holders. SAD. Also crypto currency is not a security.... HF happened before it got listed. Good luck getting any reparations... Lol.

MSM needs to STFU as usual. Brian K. is a cool dude but he has no business in crypto. He isn't even an OG like many of us here.
@_date: 2015-09-16 03:13:57
same. 
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:06:24
I would buy like 0.1 every week; and in the long run it should balance out.

Bitcoin is the only logical solution; it's not as hard as everyone makes it seem.

Buy LTC in a week and go long. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 04:36:39
Still due for reversal IMO.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:47:44
I'd wait for the price to settle down that's why I said a week. Could be a little longer. If LTC marketcap goes to 3.5 billion its worth like 68 bucks percoin. LTC breaking 40 means it could test 50s and 60s the same day.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:13:54
I haven't spoken to him since; it was some random dude on the the_donald discord. I bet he sold around 1300 or maybe held; who knows. The point is it is about timing; crypto trades like pennystocks just with a larger marketcap.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:41:29
kek. there are always weak hands those are the newbs not used to volatility, when it dips they make the dips worse.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:11:53
I should clarify that BTC maybe going bearish soon. I'd wait for FUD to clear regarding HF or SF.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:10:12
lol. I told someone to grab 10k of BTC back when it was 750. More than doubled his money now. It's not reckless it's about timing. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:41:52
yeah. I agree just like last time in march. all the drama is made to make the shorts rich.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:44:20
relax. flash crash is over. market has almost recovered 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:57:07
use the charts bro. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:02:24
Yeah it was a flash crash. 12 billion goes out over 30 min. And now its coming back. Prepare for swings.
