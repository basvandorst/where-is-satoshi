We will do when it comes round to monetising the site through retailers who want higher ranked listings etc ;)

Uninformed, daytrading or quick use in transactions I guess.

Hey guys,
I'm not new to by any means, but I've made a new account to coincide with my new business venture - WhereAcceptsBitcoin.
The premise is simple, create a directory of online &amp; physical retailers that accept Bitcoin, starting with the UK, as this is where I'm from and live. Any questions/comments/ideas you have, feel free to PM me! :)

Re: your username, did you accept BTC for her?

On the app? I'm guessing if the app can't retrieve from database then it's interpreting that as 0 funds available, hence the messages people are getting saying they have no funds...

Look into offline wallets if you plan on HODLing instead of spending it/day trading it ��

Went graphics were shit.

Their System Uptime tab says they're down to 0% :P but yeah everything else points to them being offline. However, looking at the wallet metrics, I'm guessing it's just a website error and not a problem related to the currencies or wallets themselves.

* Graphic designer
* Someone comfortable with web development, either in raw code or working with WordPress, Joomla or Drupal
* Journalist who wants to write Crypto articles
Can be one or multiple people to fulfil the above spaces. They'll be unpaid roles (like mine) until ad revenue or another revenue stream is developed, when money will be split fairly.
This could be a great opportunity to get into something new - ahem - much like getting into BTC back in the day was! Could also be a good chance for people learning to develop/run websites/become a journalist.
Reply here or PM me for more info!
Thanks.
