I also found it suspicious that a veteran trader wouldn’t mention the fact that trading futures won’t involve buying or selling any amount of BTC. OP seemed to either not know futures will be cash settled or wilfully omitted the info to increase hype.

You don’t know the difference between a fork and clone.

This is bang on the money. We’re all for letting the market decide everything until we *really* want to destroy someone and then we wish we could leverage the state’s power? Shameful hypocrisy. What are our principles?

I remember when a basic libertarian idea wasn’t a contentious issue on this sub. How things change.

Turns out we’re pro-FLOSS when we want free downloads and pro-copyright when we want to guard what we deem to be our rightful property. I don’t know why I expected anything else tbh.

Don’t you think this increase in volume will be offset by big players (who have up until now only been able to trade actual BTC) moving their money out of BTC and into futures (on a regulated exchange, which is what they always would have preferred)?

I imagine it’s difficult to end up a billionaire if you’re capable of feeling like you *have enough now*.

I agree that the interviewer is deliberately pushing Roger’s buttons but I still think the onus is on Roger to quit the situation as gracefully as possible long before he can be baited into an embarrassing meltdown. Of course it’s easy for me to say that from the comfort of my sofa and it’s not like I’ve never lost my temper before but I’m also not the self-appointed face of Bitcoin Cash. Half of PR is avoiding traps set by your competitors and the interviewer simply got the better of Roger here.

They also mentioned "his estimated $400 million of Bitcoin riches". They've basically slapped a target on his back.

I agree that it helps legitimise BTC and I’d add that introducing a futures market usually helps stabilise an asset’s price which of course helps legitimise BTC even more down the road. However I can’t see any reason that it would encourage institutional money into actual BTC. Even organisations that are actually *allowed* to get involved with under-regulated and notoriously unreliable exchanges would still almost always prefer to trade cash settled futures on a regulated exchange if only to sidestep the cybersecurity risk inherent to emerging tech.

One hopes they would have done the same if the price swung in their favour.
