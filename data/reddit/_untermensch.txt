You write this as if Bitcoin is some beast with its own mind that will eventually make its way to the moon entirely by itself. And yet, it's the market participants who will decide where they want to put their money. Right now it's not looking so good for Bitcoin since people are putting their cash into altcoins thinking those will go to the moon. Of course, people only have so much fiat cash that you actually have to work for in order to buy Bitcoin. Once the prospects of Bitcoin going to the moon are no longer felt by the majority of traders, the incentive to invest no longer exists since everyone just expects the price to magically rise on its own.

@_date: 2018-01-06 14:23:53
Bitcoin being traded on markets for fiat cash is not it's intended use. You are supposed to see Bitcoin as inflation proof and deflation proof, of course since it is tethered to the USD and other fiat currency, it experiences both inflation and deflation. A pizza in 2009 should, for arguments sake cost 0.00005 Bitcoin, and would still cost 0.00005 Bitcoin today and for the rest of humanity. When tethered  to the USD a pizza cost 10k Bitcoin at $40 in 2010 and now would cost $150 million. I'm pretty sure Satoshi Nakamoto would be disappointed with how Bitcoin is being used.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:39:46
The rise of Bitcoin's price is purely based upon the assumption that it would keep going up due to demand. In other words, you only bought it assuming someone down the road would be willing to pay more for  a piece. There is nothing other demand that supports the price of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:05:15

@_date: 2018-01-06 15:47:29
Whatever the price the market determines it to be in BTC, not in USD. Now of course, the flaw in my reasoning is that Bitcoins can be lost or stolen with relative ease, and thus this would affect the supply as we have seen. Even as a transfer of wealth it makes no sense when the volatility of it is too high and the incentive to "HODL" outweighs the incentive to use it to buy something. Then if the price fails to rise because people expect it to rise to make more fiat cash, then people will go elsewhere to "invest" like we have seen with the surge in altcoins.

While transaction fees have some part of it, I think it is the extreme volatility that turns people off. I mean, you can hedge, but that can only do so much. Why would Microsoft accept a payment in Bitcoin when its fiat value could plummet before they turn it into fiat?

and it's value is determined in fiat value. Bitcoin only makes sense when no fiat cash is being exchanged for it.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:05:44
The key take away from the article is that Bitcoin is supposed to have lower volatility and lower returns in the long run, which would make it more appealing as a safe haven. Of course, who knows how much higher it will go.

Thus, when prices get so high, you are going to invest in altcoins like we have seen to try getting a better short term return.

The US dollar is a reserve currency because, in theory, it is backed by the economic success of the USA. When the US economy does well, then its currency is generally stable and becomes "stronger". 
Of course, you can never predict what catalytic events will occur that would strengthen or weaken the dollar. Because Bitcoin isn't backed by anything other than pure demand, and its volatility is far too high to make near risk-less transactions i.e. you losing out on its appreciation during a transaction or your trade partner losing out on a depreciation of a transaction, BTC becoming a reserve currency is unlikely unless it is modified heavily over the coming years. Of course, forks are a massive threat to Bitcoin's existence given that they are improvements upon Bitcoin and thus make them more tempting to use for transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:28:59

Apparently there are exchanges that will instantly trade it for fiat cash and you can hedge to protect against currency risk (that can only go so far), but you can see that Bitcoin's volatility can be quite problematic for businesses. Trading Bitcoin for fiat cash on exchanges is not what it was intended for at all. It's nothing more than a secure vessel to transfer money ideally at a 1:1 basis. For example, if you want to pay your friend back for lunch, sending it through cryptocurrency is a secure way of doing it. But because Bitcoin is so volatile, would your friend want a Bitcoin that could plummet in fiat value after he receives it? And of course, you also miss out on gains if it rises after your transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:15:31
It won't favor holders of crypto, because the last time I checked, you still have to pay 99% of your bills in your country's currency. 
$100 in 2011 would have bought you 100 Bitcoin. $100 now buys you 0.00768 of a Bitcoin.
Bitcoin can be seen as something that wipes out the banking industry and redistributes wealth, and yet roughly 4% of the address own 95% of the supply. So much for decentralization.

It's never too late because you can buy any amount of it you want. If Bitcoin weren't divisible, it wouldn't be at $20k a coin. A homeless person with $5 could buy Bitcoin and thus, this supports the price.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:24:08
That's because it went from being some esoteric digital commodity that only geeks would trade on the interweb to being something that was being examined by businesses as a something useful. Now it's in full mainstream hysteria mode and FOMO. I'm telling you guys, Bitcoin was not meant to be traded for fiat cash, that defeats its purpose. Nowhere in the white paper does it mention exchanges or trading. Miners are supposed to mine it solely for the coin. As soon as you tether crypto to fiat currencies, it becomes both inflationary and deflationary. 10k BTC was about $40 which some guy used to buy pizza with, which is now worth $150 million fiat cash. Of course, HODL leads to deflation since no one wants to spend when it's going up in its fiat value. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:35:10
No, due to its volatility. It doesn't make sense to buy or sell something when its value could plummet or rise significantly during a transaction. Furthermore, as long as it is value is determined by how much fiat cash you are willing to pay for a coin, it cannot be a currency. It must stand on its own for it to be viable. Satoshi never mentioned in his/her/their White Paper that Bitcoin was to be traded on exchanges for fiat cash since that would defeat its purpose and which is probably why the addresses that apparently belong to Satoshi have never been used. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:30:31
Exactly. Anything that has come after Bitcoin should be seen as a scam.

Shitcoins are shitcoins. They'll come and go, Bitcoin is king.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:45:56
I could be missing something, but aren't fees supposed to provide incentive to miners when they are solving increasingly difficult and power consuming number crunching?
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:37:16
Shitcoins are created by people looking to make a quick buck. Satoshi, of course, never could have foreseen Bitcoin's rise in perceived value, and thus could not have created this as a scam. But some clever folks out there now have seen the vast wealth that can be had when you mine some of your own crypto currency when the mining is easy or when they are premined. Then when other people are trading your coins, you can make a quick buck off everyone depending on how greedy you want to be. These altcoins try to make it look like they are running a business, mostly the blockchain based ones, and yet, these businesses aren't making any money. So their market cap isn't determined by their success or cash flows, but rather solely on the demand for the crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:44:12
I thought $20k in December wasn't possible.

Yes, HODL while I sell...
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:47:57
People seem to forget that the majority of the population is poor and cannot truly make the most of investing in Bitcoin at these price levels. 60% of Americans couldn't come up with $1k for tomorrow, so investing in Bitcoin is the least of their concerns. However, given that Bitcoin is fractional, its price is largely predicated upon that you can buy a small piece of Bitcoin for any amount you want. If you had to actually buy a whole coin, no one would be able to afford it. A homeless dude with $5 can buy  a piece of a Bitcoin and thus this supports its $20k a coin price.

Looking at the historical data, the FED has done a reasonable job so far. Why is inflation so low given the trillions in QE since 2009?

Still not quite as decentralized as everyone makes it out to be.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:49:02
Inflationary when tethered to fiat ($150 million pizza!), then it's deflationary when all coins are mined and people are HODLing because they assume it's fiat worth will go up, then the price of goods begin to fall (in theory, Japan is an example). 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:09:39
As a method to securely transfer money, yes. As a currency, is it not stable enough yet. Bitcoin needs to lose the association with other currencies and needs to stand on its own to be viable. As long as its worth is determined by the USD, it is not a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:39:15
Businesses have to release quarterly reports to indicate how well they are doing. If a company does well, its stock rises. If it does poorly, then obviously its stock will fall. Of course, when you buy stock you are betting the company will do well. Bitcoin is built entirely on a house of cards. You just buy it assuming that other people will be buying it and willing to buy it at the market price. Given the fractional nature of Bitcoin, anyone can buy an amount of Bitcoin at essentially any price. However, $100 USD would have got you 100 BTC in 2011, now $100 gets you 0.008 of a Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:44:20
You're rich until you aren't. It's possible it could go to $1 million a coin if everyone keeps pumping their hard earned fiat cash into it. If another recession hits the economy, then those who are taking out loans to buy crypto currency will be hit the hardest, assuming they lose their job. Due to the fractional nature of Bitcoin and other coins, anyone can buy a small amount of it and thus keeping the whales a float. The higher the price goes, the less you own, the more Bitcoin has to rise in fiat value for you to make a decent return. It's possible that it could end up being one of the greatest creators of wealth inequality ever created. Those who were lucky to have bought it early reap the rewards, while those who missed out, even because they were born later miss out are stuck at the bottom (assuming the price rises exponentially).
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:33:07
So is it an asset or a currency? As a currency it clearly fails, unless, the USD association is removed. It could be a commodity, but there is a constant influx of new crypto which erode Bitcoin's value, and of course one of the forks could be the next big thing. See, even with gold, there is only kind of gold and one kind of oil. Bitcoin can have an infinite number of clones. All different on paper in their technicalities, but in essence they are the same with improvements to each iteration.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:08:21
What I don't understand is why miners will continue to mine when fees are 0 or near 0
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:05:09
As we can see Bitcoin, when tethered to the USD, is experiencing hyperinflation.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:03:06
If there is  another recession, I would assume the price of all asset classes will decline in the short term. If people are borrowing money to buy Bitcoin, which appears to be the case, then we could see some real consequences. Remember, people lose their jobs during recessions. When you don't have a job, you can't earn the fiat cash to buy Bitcoin when you have liabilities to pay like rent, food, gas etc. which you can't really pay for with Bitcoin. So we could see a sharp selloff of people liquidating to fiat cash so you can pay your bills. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:15:19
Except: When everyone is liquidating to convert to fiat, what happens to the price?
I don't know why everyone is scared of inflation. 
4% own 95% of the supply and you think the Big Banks are scary?

White Paper does not mention trading fiat cash for Bitcoin

I don't see where I'm wrong. You have numerous cryptos just like there were numerous dotcom companies promising to be the next big thing.

They can make it illegal for businesses to use. Doubt they could really stop people from using it though.
@_date: 2019-07-14 02:22:55
That doesn't make sense. How can you buy more bitcoin without USDs? Based on what OP is saying, assuming his salary is fully paid in bitcoin, if he were to receive it on a Friday and it plummets 10% in value relative to USDs, what does OP do? Perhaps OP doesn't live paycheck to paycheck so he can HODL and hope it rises, but for most people losing 10% of your salary would be tough to stomach. Of course, it could also spike 10%. But, if you just end up immediately converting bitcoin to USDs, it seems like you are adding risk for no reason.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:35:36
Typical fiat currency isn't seen as an investment though and is relatively stable

And yet, roughly 4% of the Bitcoin addresses own roughly 95% of the supply
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:14:05
I'm pretty sure I know what I'm talking about. Bitcoin was not meant to be traded; it was meant for a fixed priced economy that is inflation and deflation proof. Trading it for fiat cash and measuring its success in fiat cash is nothing more than a delusion and a rather unfortunate distraction from its intended purpose.

True, but misleading. While the dollar declines in value, people also earn more money on average. So if an apple increases its fiat value by 2% in a year, generally, wages will have increased by 2%. Obviously, this is a generalization and inflation and wage growth are not perfectly in tandem.

You just have to ask yourself: "Do I want to pay more than the current market price for some btc?"
The best thing that could happen would be for btc to go back down to a couple bucks or cents. It's not meant to be valued in fiat terms. That is why Satoshi never mentions btc should be exchanged for fiat cash on exchanges. This is why Satoshi's addresses haven't moved. btc is the currency, independent of fiat valuation.

There would still be a possibility to have loans, but the people giving you loans could, in theory, run out of money to loan. Given that there is a fixed supply, and that coins will be lost along the way, there is only so much to give out. For example, if you need money now to buy a house or car, you go to the bank for a loan, and they can give you one because of fractional reserve banking. In other words, it is unlikely they won't have enough money to give you. If they only had bitcoin, which is limited, then they might run out since they can't print more of it. In theory, that guy ahead of you could get the last amount of bitcoin they have while you walk out with nothing.

Given that most goods and services are presently valued in fiat terms, if fiat were to "crash" of become subject of hyper-inflation, then the price of BTC will also be relative to the price of fiat. In other words, BTC at $1 000 000 a coin doesn't help when an apple costs $1k

You have to use debt to take on risk for growth. For example, you have to work for your money to buy a house or car. What if you don't have the money upfront to buy it? You go to the bank and get a loan. Then you pay it off with your future earnings. Now if we had a fixed supply, the bank might not have enough to lend to you, or perhaps they would rather just hold on to their cash since it has a lower risk and higher return than you paying off your mortgage. If you use a fixed supply, you can still have growth, but you won't get the kind of growth with a controlled rate of inflation.
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:48:22

Bitcoin probably won't do too much, though there is a good chance it will go down with the markets. The thing is, we never know when the markets are really crashing, or when the floor comes. A 10% drop in the stock markets feels much worse than 1% every day for 10 days. Crypto could be a sign that markets have peaked and that future returns won't be as high, thus crypto offers a better perceived return.

A hobo had enough money to buy bitcoin, and still does in a sense. Just a couple bucks won't turn into thousands any time soon.

As bitcoin's fiat value rises, we become poorer as you own less of a piece of a bitcoin. The endgame is bitcoin itself, not its fiat value. And bitcoin's fractional nature makes its true supply 2.1 quadrillion. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 01:04:41
Fractional reserve banking would help. Bitcoin would do nothing to stop it. Banks could still lend out much more than they hold. Though, I'm not so sure why everyone thinks war is the only thing that keeps money being printed. The wealthy inequality would simply come from the fact that people procured enough bitcoin early enough. As the price rises, your fiat money becomes worth less as in you own less of a bitcoin. Furthermore, if you own a majority of the supply, now everyone has to come to you to get a piece of it. Unless, people create their own crypto...
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:14:01
HODLing or going long term is flawed reasoning because that logic only really applies to a broad market like a stock market index that replaces poorly performing companies. The markets only appear to go up due to surviorship bias. Of course, you can still lose a lot of money if the market goes down. Bitcoin is not the market, and thus "going long", doesn't guarantee it will survive. Bitcoin isn't some "savior" of technology, someone in a poor country could have put their life savings in at $20k a coin, and right now things would be looking pretty grim for them, because you have to pay bills which have deadlines. Going long just isn't an option for everyone when you are poor and desperate. Bitcoin can't fix a poorly run country. Even if a country used a fixed supply currency, they would still be in the gutters due to corruption and poor economic decision making. Inflation is a symptom of a poorly run country, not a cause.
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:50:03

A pound of bread in 1913 was $0.061 and in 2008 $1.27. A 2 246% increase. Seems roughly proportional no? Though to be fair, we are taxed much more than before. Perhaps someone with a better understanding of economics could point me in the right direction if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:21:34
Which would be deflation. There would be little incentive to invest/ take on risk when you can just hodl. Thus, the price of goods and services begin to fall, and this expectation falls into a downward spiral. "Hmm, let's offset buying that TV because its price is plummeting every week"

The demand for diamonds is on a decline, and people are favoring lab made diamonds because they are cheaper and better for the environment. Hypothetically speaking, if everyone in the world owned diamonds, the price would plummet as they are no longer "scarce". There were some periods in history, before fiat money was invented, where some nations suffered inflation due to an influx of gold, because there was so much of it to go around for everyone to own. Thus, the prices of goods and services rise.

Why do I constantly see "To the moon" threads and "I put 90% of my net worth into Bitcoin". Without willing participants at its increasing fiat value, there is no longer any support. Your wealth is dependent on others to either HODL or keep paying the fiat price for it with their scarce amount of hard earned fiat cash. If you keep HODLing, then there is little use of it for transactions. If you sell it off, then you risk losing out on more fiat value as you now have to buy back a smaller piece of Bitcoin at a higher fiat price.

Ever care to wonder how people still "survive", despite the dollar losing 96% of its value? Well my friend, that is because wages have risen in tandem along with inflation. In 1913 the average wage was $1 296 a year. A lb of bread cost $0.061. The average salary was $37 388 in 2008, a 2 885% increase from 1913. A lb of bread cost $1.37 in 2008, a 2 246% increase.

Most likely not until markets can be regulated. There is still too many ways to manipulate the price and get away with it at the expense of traders. I don't know why everyone is excited about a bitcoin etf. Can you use your etf to buy something with it? No. Are etfs perfect investment vehicles? No, they are not. Stock and other asset etfs are starting to show flaws. Can the ETF provider keep their bitcoin safe from hackers? What happens when a fork occurs? If an etf provider uses cold storage, then they will have to lend out IOUs for the bitcoin etf, which is already an IOU.

Bitcoin and crypto has mostly hit the mainstream awareness, thus, most people have now seen the price go from $20k to $6k in a matter of months.

Furthermore, more awareness that you need to pay taxes on crypto are going to make people far more reluctant to buy it along with the crackdown on using credit cards to buy it.

Bitcoin would be legit without a fiat price. A fiat price does not make a transaction "reliable" given its volatility. Would you accept a piece of a Bitcoin worth $50 US for a widget, only to have the price plummet 10% after the transaction is made? If you run a low margin business, this would eat away at your bottom line pretty quickly. Furthermore, as the price climbs, we become poorer since we now how to buy back a small amount of Bitcoin at a higher price. There is little incentive to spend when you should be HODLing. That "small" fraction of a Bitcoin you spend now could be worth thousands more later on.

Like I said, a fixed supply currency wouldn't fix bad economic decisions. The government is still making bad economic decisions, which they in turn try to fix by increasing the money supply. You can still make poor investments with a fixed supply currency. So even then, their currency would still experience "weakness" and far less purchasing power relative to other currencies. On a side note, bitcoin and other fixed supply currency would do nothing to stop fractional reserve banking. Banks could still just as easily use "IOUs" to lend out more money than they hold in reserve. And besides, they would have to use IOUs because the only way to keep bitcoin secure is to use cold storage, thus, none of bitcoin would be in circulation.

And man made crypto, no different than fiat. Millennials are the ones driving the price of crypto. The price is based on desperation, because Millennials are too poor to afford anything. The price determination is based on collective socialism. *If we all buy it, we can all become rich*. If anything, crypto would cause even greater wealth inequality because something like 1% of addresses hold 40% of the supply. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 01:56:10
Bitcoin doesn't generate interest. Another wealth exchange? Don't those always end up the same with a 1% owning the 99%? Bitcoin would make wealth inequality even worse. There would be little incentive to invest in entrepreneurship when you could just HODL safely. The economy would stagnate because of HODLing, or at the very least, grow at a much slower pace. Sure, fiat printing can be crappy at times if the government doesn't know what they are doing, but the global economy wouldn't be where we are now if we were still using gold as a medium of exchange. Using Bitcoin would be like sending us back to the Stone Age because of its fixed supply. 
I agree that technology is idealogically neutral, but that doesn't mean you can't market Bitcoin as a socialist utopia by a mainstream group. Or perhaps I should say, Bitcon's fiat price is the socialist utopia. People are getting it all wrong, when it comes to Bitcoin. You're supposed to be using it as if we were back the days of using gold and silver as currency, no fiat price assigned to it.
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:43:43

Because the circulating supply isn't really 21 million. In theory, the more people that use bitcoin, the greater chance that more bitcoin will be lost forever due to human error. Thus, we can see a a constantly dwindling circulating supply. All it would take is for an exchange to screw up something or a rogue employee to wipe out millions of bitcoin. Of course, at first this could be seen as helping to boost the fiat price, but then again, why use something that could be "lost forever"?

It's a socialist uprising (perhaps libertarian too), bringing the means of creating money to the people, not the central banks.

I suppose it's more of a psychological thing. If you see that someone owns bitcoin, perhaps you might be more inclined to rob them vs someone who doesn't advertise that they own it. But, of course, we see payments being demanded from ransomware. If people do become more educated on anonymous crypto and realize that they could extort people with relative ease, then it could become a problem.

You could send them an anonymous email to tell them to pay up or get them fired, provided you send the info to your boss anonymously.

Bitcoin's price increase is as socialist as it gets: *Buy this and we all can get rich*. Bitcoin is the epitome of the Millennial Y.O.L.O mentality and their entitlement. Millennials all over the world are drowning in debt and can't find jobs. Bitcoin is seen as a way out for them and other poor people. So long as the collective socialist mentality holds up, then they can all be winners and walk away with a trophy that has a Bitcoin logo on it.

The main catalyst for upward price movement is the mainstream notion that you can become a millionaire overnight. There are some hardcore believers who don't care about fiat price, and they are on the right track, as Bitcoin should not have a fiat price. But the current mania is mostly driven by desperate, entitled Millennials looking to buy their first home or pay off their student debt. *If everyone buys in, we can all get rich and not have to work*. This is collective socialism.

The only thing that is good about Bitcoin is its secure transactions that do not involve financial intermediaries. People fail to separate the speculative price of Bitcoin on exchanges and its use as a transactional technology. You don't need a fiat price assigned to Bitcoin to transact with as this hurts its ability to do so. The exchanges are the cock roaches looking to make a quick buck off people trading this stuff. I like how everyone brings up how they read the white paper, and yet they seem to not realize that Satoshi never mentions exchanging Bitcoin for fiat cash.

I don't think it would be would be a disaster, but like I said, people would become less willing to take on risk. This can be good, but of course at the cost of increasing the global economy more rapidly. Modest inflation is good for the economy. High rates of unchecked inflation on the other hand, is a symptom of a poorly run country. Bitcoin or other fixed price currencies cannot fix or prevent bad economic decisions made by leaders.
Moreover, even after 10 years of QE since the Great Recession, we have yet to see inflation. So it would appear that even mass printing can have little effect on inflation, which is admittedly somewhat bizarre.

And Bitcoin does not need a constantly fluctuating fiat price to make it useful as a secure way of sending money to other people without the need for a financial institution. If people are "greaddy as fuck", then that would explain the rise of altcoins as people no longer see Bitcoin as a path to quick riches. Furthermore, if Bitcoin is the epitome of greed, then we could see wars and people killing each other over this "scarce" resource that is needed to facilitate day to day existence. Doesn't sound like a world I want to live in.
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:11:55
You really think bitcoin would prevent a country from making poor economic decisions? Hyper inflation is a symptom of a poorly run country. It doesn't just emerge out of the grass like a wild inflation has appeared and start wreaking havoc.
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:02:44
Then what would be the point of entrepreneurship? Everyone will keep hodling until they think they found the right investment. Everyone's risk tolerance will be incredibly low. Of course, this could be good in some respects, it is possible the booms and busts of the economy might be reduced, however at the cost of significantly slower growth. Fiat printing, for the most part is what has allowed the economy to accelerate, and of course with the booms and busts. Going back to "Stone Age" trading with a fixed supply currency might not be the best way forward.

No. It's an apparent speculative "investment" that you are betting on. You buy it assuming that someone will be willing to pay more for it later on with their scare fiat cash on hand. If Bitcoin were a true currency, then its value would not fluctuate at all. We have to value Bitcoin outside of its fiat valuation.

This guy is full of shit. Looking for patterns when there are none. Furthermore, we still don't know how easily the markets are manipulated. So it's possible that any previous gains were fabricated, thus the demand for bitcoin was not and is not as high as thought. If it was possible for one person to manipulate the price from $100 to $1k, then that is artificial demand. If it were really that easy to paint a chart on top of another one to predict the future, why isn't this guy a trillionaire now?

There is no "change", using just Bitcoin as a global currency would bring the economy back to the point in history where fiat was not invented and we were still using gold as currency. It could work, but it would stall the economy because no one would have any risk appetite to invest in businesses. The only thing that is useful about crypto is that you can send money securely without the need for a financial intermediary, but you don't need a volatile fiat price assigned to it to do it. Trading bitcoin defeats its purpose. Moreover, bitcoin does nothing to stop fractional reserve banking because they can still lend out more than they hold with "IOUs". Ultimately, we are going to end up using a crypto currency that has an algorithm to control the rate on inflation.

Since the exchanges are the middlemen who allow people to trade, then they can be considered influencers on the market. There are only a handful of miners out there with powerful rigs, and they can exert some influence, since we depend on them to verify transactions. They could bail on Bitcoin and move to a more profitable coin, if one were to come out. Early HODLers own the bulk of the supply of a fixed currency. Now you have to buy it from them. Perhaps greed will get the best of them?

There is some evidence that one trader managed to spike the price from $150 to $1000 in 2013. They use wash trading or bid/ask walls to manipulate the prices.

I'm not saying it's evil to hold money, just that bitcoin users seem to think banks are evil, and yet if bitcoin were to become some global currency, then they would effectively become the new evil banks. When you can just hold bitcoin, there is little incentive to invest into new ventures to try to grow your wealth. This would make entrepreneurship far more difficult as they would find it more difficult to access capital because no one would need to take on risk. As of now, there is far more to lose by using your bitcoin's you have saved. Those small amounts could be worth far more in the future. If bitcoin were to increase in fiat value, you now have to spend more to buy a smaller piece.

I didn't say bitcoin stops people from spending, I said it makes you less likely to spend given that there is little risk to holding. There would be little reason to invest. Smarter investing? Perhaps, but "smarter" investments do not guarantee success or a return on investment either. When you deposit your money in a bank, they in turn use that to invest in business. Of course, you could as well, but how many people would have the capital or risk tolerance (especially when you can just hold) to invest in a business venture. And of course, it's not like bitcoin would increase your wage. You would still have to take out a loan to mortgage your house. There is now less incentive for a bank to give you a loan or anyone else for that matter.

You fail to understand that there is "good" inflation and "bad" inflation. Inflation that is managed and controlled can be good for the economy, while hyperinflation is bad.

There would be little incentive to invest when you could just hold onto Bitcoin. Global economic growth would slow.

You are right that Bitcoin is not quite like stocks. It is more like gold, but even then, gold actually requires human labor to mine out of the ground. However, because Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, there is no price floor or ceiling which is why it it so volatile and can go to 0 or moon at any time. Bitcoin's supply and difficulty is arbitrarily determined and PoS largely removes the mining aspect of crypto.

You misunderstand deflation. Deflation generally occurs to the price of goods and services, not the currency. And in some sense, Bitcoin's deflation is already priced in, given that we know it will occur in 120 years.

Ya let them buy Bitcoin only to watch it plummet in value. If they bought at $20k a coin, they're fucked right now. And no, poor people usually don't have the time to "hodl" and wait it out when they live paycheck to paycheck and have to feed their kids.

I suppose it depends on what you want to do with your savings and your risk tolerance. You could invest in assets that generate a return like stocks or bonds. Of course, you could still lose money.  But generally, idle cash doesn't help an economy. If bitcoin becomes some asset that doesn't lose value, then you're more inclined to hodl.
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:16:26
I wouldn't go as far as saying crypto is worthless, or at the main ones line Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's the underlying technology that is useful, as in sending money securely without the need for an institution. The fiat price that people are seemingly willing to pay for is mostly driven by the idea of collective socialism. *If you buy it, and I buy it, we can all get rich.*

@_date: 2018-08-25 05:27:23
The paper is worthless. You only use it because it is backed "in spirit" by the country's economy that it represents. In the case of the USA, you use it because there is a low probability that the USA will default on its loans and that it won't print money at a unreasonably high rate in the short term. Of course, people here seem to think that the dollar has lost value over time, which is true but misleading since average annual salaries have also risen in proportion to the price of goods and services in which they are valued in fiat terms.

@_date: 2018-05-27 18:09:37
You don't get it. Bitcoin doesn't solve a corrupt government from making poor economic decisions. Hyper inflation and a weak currency are symptoms of poor management. A fixed currency wouldn't make a difference because they would still make poor investments, nor would it solve their political instability. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:17:33
As a transactional means yes, but given its volatility, and "going to the moon" mentality, why spend any of it when it a few Satoshis could be worth thousands later on? Or if you do a transactions with someone else, the price could plunge leaving the other person with a Bitcoin worth less than what the price of the good or service is worth in fiat terms. So why not use a stable coin like Tether or True USD for transactions?
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:06:44
The technology is not a scam, the *trading* of it is. Nowhere in Satoshi's white paper does Satoshi mention trading bitcoin for fiat cash, let alone on exchanges run by cockroach middlemen who are looking to make a fiat buck off your trading, regardless of bitcoin's price.
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:52:15
There are no guarantees with an expanding fiat money supply or a fixed supply. A controlled money supply is better than a fixed supply. Don't get me wrong, a fixed supply could work, but I think there would be some significant problems that would pop up. A controlled money supply would allow for an economy to grow quicker, even with its booms and busts vs a fixed supply currency economy. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:43:17
Bitcoin doesn't really do anything to banks, if anything, once banks get their own versions going, it will make them even stronger. People fail to realize that Bitcoin does nothing to stop fractional reserve banking. They can still lend out more Bitcoin than they hold, with "on paper" IOUs.
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:03:38

I wouldn't be surprised. They're trying to sell it as some "libertarian fuck the government" alternative, and yet they could be using it to track everyone. Blockchain and crypto could easily be used to record every move you make in life and turn our lives into complete data sources (yes, even more than what is going on now). Perhaps they are using it to fund black projects.
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:00:18
Cockroach middlemen looking to make some money off your trading. Satoshi never mentions trading fiat cash for Bitcoin in the white paper as this defeats Bitcoin's purpose...
@_date: 2018-05-05 03:41:10
more traffic != higher fiat price. Coinbase, along with other exchanges, are cockroach middlemen looking to make a fiat buck off people trading it. Goldman Sachs is trading it because their high net worth clients want in on some hot money. GS couldn't care less about Bitcoin, it could go to zero and they would still be making a juicy commission from their clients as Coinbase would too.

I've been saying all along that bitcoin does nothing to prevent fractional reserve banking or prevent monetary decentralization. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:43:26
The higher the price of Bitcoin goes, the poorer we get. Why you ask? Because your hard earned fiat cash is now worth less; you own less of a piece of the pie. Perhaps we have reached the mainstream "scarring" moment where people who bought at $20k only to see it crumble down to $6k in a month will never buy it again. Furthermore, we still don't know how manipulated the price of Bitcoin is. If one trader could have pumped the price from $150 to $1000 in 2013, then who knows what several of them could do now. Don't forget Tether...
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:06:29
One is backed by a country's economic success, while Bitcoin has no backing and therefore no price floor or ceiling. When you use USD, you are using it assuming that the economy is not bad enough to start printing money to the point of hyperinflation. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:41:04
Then we can see that forks do, in theory, increase the supply of crypto. Furthermore, bitcoin is no different than the point in history when we only used gold and silver as currency, so if anything, we're just going back to the old ways of finance.

This argument is entirely predicated upon when you bought bitcoin. If you happened to have bought it when it was trading for pennies or a few bucks, then you have little to lose. If you bought it at $20k, then you're gonna be feeling like shit. Furthermore, more people are now aware of bitcoin's lack of price stability and supposed "safety". People tend to forget that most people need to put food on the table and pay bills, and roughly 60% of Americans can't come up with $500 in an emergency, I'm not sure if bitcoin or any other volatile asset would be for them.

You are right that people use technology everyday that is beyond their comprehension. My concern with crypto is *accountability* and your money. I think that for most, becoming your own bank is too much of a burden. Of course, you will probably say: "Banks aren't accountable for your money over a certain amount", which is true, but at least they will cover some losses in the event that you are scammed. Furthermore, crypto and blockchain offer and illusion of security that can be exploited even more so with cash or credit, in the sense of "bad actors".

@_date: 2018-06-04 00:52:29
Regardless, if it were to catch on, and skyrocket to $1mil a coin, but you sold it all off, now you have to buy it back at a higher price and own less of a coin. Even then, you still intend to spend when the price of it is higher; you're not going to start buying things with it if the fiat price were to drop. If you bought at $20k a coin are you going to start buying things with it given that it is at $7.7k a coin? Why is the mantra here to HODL or wait till it moons?
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:03:23

If you wanted to pay back all of the debt in one go, they yes, there is not enough money to do it. Thankfully, all the debt does not have to be paid off in one massive lump sump at some point in time; it's "staggered". Debt is a necessary evil. Otherwise, how would you be able to afford a house, car, or some other large expenditure that is necessary?

This isn't manipulation. This is the result of the manipulators bailing out. This is bitcoin falling to its natural price level
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:28:38
No one, but does it matter? As we have seen, bitcoin's cryptographic nature is largely undermined by human failure to secure the means in which it is stored. Given that it is pseudo-anonymous or perhaps anonymous if it converted to zcash or Monero, it is difficult to track these financial crimes and find out who hacked the exchanges.

@_date: 2018-06-23 00:14:35
You sound desperate bro. The funny thing is, it seems like you really care about the falling fiat value of bitcoin and yet, you also seem to hate fiat money. Shouldn't you be happy the price is falling so you can buy more bitcoin with your limited fiat paycheck?

Ya if you convince everyone to take out a loan to buy some and pump it up with Tether, then sure it can moon
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:36:48
Because the price was pumped up from tether, bots, whales and most likely exchange collusion

Hindsight is 20/20 bro
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:37:20
It's backed by the economy of the USA and for the most part, the assurance that the USA won't go into  complete money printing mode to bails itself out of a shitty economic situation i.e. hyperinflation. Even after the massive fiscal stimulus and printing to bail out the economy from the 2008 recessions, we're barely even seeing inflation creep up. Moreover, Japan is facing serious economic problems because too many people are holding cash.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:31:53
You really think bitcoin is going to solve debt problems?
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:56:22
Have I not made myself clear? Bitcoin is more like a stock in the sense that it is an individual security, it is not the market. You're forgetting that wages tend to rise with inflation. The average wage in 1913 was $1,296.00. In 2008 it was $37,388.00, a 2 885% increase. A pound of bread in 1913 was $0.061. In 2008 it was $1.37, a 2 246% increase.
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:02:49
It most certainly is in a bubble and most shitcoins will go to zero since they are worthless. Bitcoin will probably see further declines, but it will survive.

But Erik Finman said anything under $100k is a steal!
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:28:08
Of course you can lose cash in your wallet or if you keep your life savings under your mattress and your house burns down. But the point I'm trying to make is that bitcoin is going to be too technologically complex for most people to grasp. Furthermore, people are going to trust it far more than they should. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:10:41
No one knew it was the top. You could have assumed it would hit $100k a coin. Hindsight is 20/20.

Erik Finman claims that buying bitcoin under $100k is a steal
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:41:11


That's because you're supposed to buy BTC to invest in the ICOs. If most ICOs are shit, then there is less demand for BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:01:49

@_date: 2018-06-30 02:36:48
And yet, bitcoin can be hacked due to human error in securing it, as we have seen numerous times already. Of course, so can money and gold, but they don't exactly provide a false sense of security through cryptography. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:01:56
And if you knew how it worked, you'd be a developer and make your own coin and get richer from that rather than owning bitcoin.

If some people pump more tether into it, then sure. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:51:21
This is correct, however, the one key piece of information that you have conveniently left out is that wages have gone up-for the most part-in tandem with inflation.

You might not know me, but as it turns out, we are related! Apparently I am a distant cousin of yours!

I would like to visit you to let you know more about this will of his! Please send me some bitcoin, so I can pay for a plane ticket to come meet you! I will also need some bitcoin for appropriate accommodations. Your wealthy uncle would want you to have your money that is rightfully yours!
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:57:18
What are you trying to get at? All that cryptography for bitcoin, and yet, one human error completely undermines it all. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:24:33
True, but it doesn't offer a false sense of security
@_date: 2018-06-03 17:57:54
This is why bitcoin will never take off. It's already bad enough with cash scams, it will be worse with bitcoin since everyone will think it's "secure" because it's cryptographic and permanently stored, especially to those who are technologically inept. Even then, some tech savvy people have been scammed. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:27:32
More people buying or putting money into an asset doesn't mean the price will go up

@_date: 2018-06-17 20:00:51
No shit he'll say something likes this since he is setting up a crypto trading desk. Remember, cockroach middlemen like these guys don't give a shit about the price of bitcoin, they just want you to trade it so they can take away cold hard fiat cash off you.  
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:06:43
Ya everything is all fine and dandy until bitcoin's fiat price drops 10% after your family receives the money. Now they can't pay rent or buy food until the price goes back up, if it does.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:43:13
But what is the point of bitcoin's security if you can just hack the man that owns it?
@_date: 2018-06-03 17:54:03
Bitcoin is basically welfare
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:24:05
I'm suspecting this is another short squeeze or just more tether pump n' dump. There are no laws in place to prevent bitcoin manipulation, so no one is going to jail. They'll milk this as hard as they can before it becomes a crime.
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:14:47
Then suddenly bitcoin isn't scarce
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:49:10
Just gotta tell everyone to take out a loan and to keep buying at whatever price level it is at. Maybe pump some tether into it too, then you'll get to $250k a coin
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:36:27
You assume that the price isn't being manipulated. There is evidence that suggest it was manipulated from $100 to $1k
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:20:10
If it's being manipulated to new highs, then the demand isn't as strong as thought
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:13:16

@_date: 2018-06-24 22:05:58
Well, it depends on the regulations. Regulations affecting market manipulation will obviously not be good for the short term price.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:38:47
Ya but you lost out on making millions more if you sold at peak
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:25:55
If you're set on cashing out at your price target, then kudos to you
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:54:09
And thus, the higher the price of bitcoin becomes, the poorer we get. See, now Greg has to spend more money to acquire 1 bitcoin, or he now owns less of a piece of the pie at the price rises. His earnings from his job do not rise in proportion. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:21:04
This is assuming that there isn't price manipulation going on by whales. There is some evidence that suggests bitcoin was manipulated from $100 to $1k. There is also some evidence that whales have cashed out long a go and the markets are now mostly run by short term speculators. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:07:10
People are going to think: "oh, its cryptographically secure, there is no way it can be hacked". So they're going to put more trust into it than they should. Just look at the exchanges being hacked or the number of crypto scams going on. Then the only way to really keep it secure is through cold storage, then if you need to keep it in cold storage, then it can't really be used to purchase things. Then, people are going to start using derivatives instead of actual crypto trading hands which defeats the purpose of crypto in the first place. Then people will realize that they can lend out more than they hold in crypto reserve, which again defeats bitcoins use as a way to stop fractional reserve banking. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:48:12
If you bought early enough and made some good money, just get out before it comes down to below your buy point.

If they manipulate the markets with Tether again, then sure, it could hit $20k again.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:41:23
Of course, to be fair, bitcoin would appear to be far more useful than beanie babies ever could be. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:46:27
Bitcoin's price has been most likely manipulated by bots, whales, Tether and exchange collusion. Thus, as regulators beginning to step in, they will target these people who are doing illegal trading methods to make money. These "bad actors" will start to bail out, but some will try to milk it on the way down. I suspect they now wait for "good" news to come out about crypto to pump up prices with Tether and bots only to dump a few days later.
Holding logic only really applies to buying a broad *market* index fund. Stocks get replaced in the indexes if they perform poorly, thus markets seemingly go up over time due to surviorship bias. Bitcoin is not the market, and thus can fade out of existence like some businesses have. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:21:56
Because they can't handle the fact that most people are too poor to make investing in bitcoin worthwhile or other assets for that matter. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:27:14
Well, you'll just have to look back on the good old days when you could have sold and bought yourself a lambo
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:42:37
I'm talking more about exchanges being hacked. But yes, keep your private key secure too.
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:11:12
In other words, China could own the crypto market. Wouldn't be surprised if they're trying to fuck up the global markets through crypto.

What you said makes sense only if the population stops increasing. Of course, there are more than enough satoshis right now to go around for everyone to use, out of a fixed system. Of course, I'm also assuming that people would want bitcoin to be further divided.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:51:56
I'd be more scared of the largest holders of bitcoin than central banks
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:31:46
They hold U.S dollars as a reserve because it is relatively stable, not because it appreciates in value rapidly. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:46:26
No because it is currently being manipulated like a motherfucker by bots and tether being pumped into it, most likely by exchanges who are colluding. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:22:03
Hype affects both of them
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:09:08
Because you would have provided some in-depth explanations already about bitcoin rather than continuing to ask me questions.
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:26:36

crypto prices are purely based on willingness of participating buyers and sellers. If you think someone will buy bitcoin off you at a higher price, just because they want to, then go ahead and speculate on that. Stocks are different because they are actually based on the success or failures of a business. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:53:18
Short squeeze
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:05:19

*cough* tether *cough*
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:27:57
But the context of OP's question is based on the scenario of a dwindling supply of bitcoin due to losses. So either, you keep expanding the supply through division, or face the problem of a dwindling supply and increasing usage if the population were to increase. In a hypothetical scenario, if the supply of bitcoin was 100, and it was divisible to ten decimals places. 100/0.1=1000. Thus, 1000 "pieces" can circulate. Only a few people would be able to own a piece. Now, you could divided to a thousand decimals places. 100/0.001=100 000. Now there are 100 000 pieces to go around. More people can have access to bitcoin now.
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:40:22
This logic is flawed. If patterns really did "repeat" themselves, then everyone would rush in to buying bitcoin now because "it has"gone up before, so it will go back up later". Thus, if this were the case, then bitcoin's future value would be the current price, which would most likely be in the millions or perhaps billions.

10% is good and is what most people would probably end up getting, but the drive to find a new crop of investments is still there. With Bitcoin, there is no new crop and no new competition, or at least, no one owning Bitcoin wants that.

That doesn't appear to be the case. Every fork seems to reduce the price of BTC, just like a dividend does to a stock price.  So you're not really getting "free" money. If BCC wasn't trading at $1.3k, BTC would be at $7.5k

You could have said the same thing during the Dotcom Bubble and you can look at the stock markets now and say that. If it were truly known to be exponential, then everyone would be all in and the price would be at $1 million plus per coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:19:19
You're right. No one can predict the price of any stock or cryptocoin. It could go to the moon or go to zero. Since it has no intrinsic value, there is no price floor and no price ceiling.

It's just as much of a fallacy to assume that bullishness indicates the price will only go up.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:59:26
If Bitcoin's growth was truly exponential, then every would be buying it on the assumption that it only goes up. Thus, the price would be reflecting that already, which it isn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:35:23
HODL right guys? HODL that shit, it will go up again for sure!
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:46:32
It's been in a bull market for 8 years. Only can go up!
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:19:07
If that were truly the case, then everyone would assume it will just keep going up, the price would reflect that, hence the term "pricing in". It just looks exponential in hindsight. You could have assumed the same thing with a tech stock back during the Dotcom Bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:34:10
But it's in a parabolic state! It can only go up!

@_date: 2017-11-05 15:46:08
It is "worthless", however people are still willing to fork out cash for it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:41:18
I must admit, the divisibility of Bitcoin is what is keeping the prices up. But I believe that at some point there will be a "cash out" period. Like I said though, for the average person, they aren't going to have the cash for the lottery like returns. But of course, the supply should be then seen as 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis because of the divisibility. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:17:49
HODL to 0
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:24:14
That is an interesting way of looking at it. However, other than the utility of sending money, there is little use for Bitcoin (thus far). Furthermore, the technology behind Bitcoin is not proprietary. I understand that there is a massive user base that is difficult to cultivate, and of course this is because Bitcoin was first, but the technology behind it can be copied and improved upon either through forks or through other crypto technology. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:57:10
It becomes  worth less (not worthless) over time. You still have to exchange fiat for it and people only have so much cash. 63% of Americans can't come up with $500 in an emergency. Is Bitcoin an investment or a currency? It can't be both. There is no price discovery in Bitcoin unlike stocks where there are routinely new IPOS that *could be* the next Amazon,  Microsoft, Apple etc., thus you invest in a new round of stocks in the ideal world (easier said than done of course). With Bitcoin, early adopters win as the price moves higher. However, a higher price means fewer people will be interested in the investment aspect of Bitcoin because their fiat is now worth less against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:57:26
Honestly, fiat will become crypto, as in the elimination of physical cash like paper bills an coins. BTC will be around and have its uses, but will not become a standard currency.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:19:17
Cryptocurrency and blockchain are great. Bitcoin is just a brand that uses it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:43:51
Do you know when to cash out? What if it drops 50% right now? HODL still or what if it keeps dropping and you see millions disappear? What do you do? As they say: "Buying is the easy part, but knowing when to sell is the most difficult"
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:32:21
If BCC keeps going up, BTC will keep going down. Told you guys that forks will decrease the value of BTC

@_date: 2017-11-05 16:36:40
Ever heard of scarcity? You either buy your new $1k iPhone, pay rent, buy food, travel etc. Or you invest in something that is uncertain. Of course the flaw in my reasoning is that not just Americans buy Bitcoin. However, I would assume most of the world population cannot afford investing in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:06:36
Exactly. Early adopters reap the rewards, late adopters won't see those returns. I fear there will be a "cash out" point at some point one the majority of holders are satisfied with their returns and liquidate back to their currency of choice. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:36:07
21 million could be seen as 2.1 quadrillion once Satoshis are being used regularly. Hypothetically, the supply is unlimited assuming there are more forks.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:02:29
63% of Americans can't come up with $500 for an emergency. 69% have less than $1000 in savings.  Only 55% of Americans invest in the stock market. People only have so much cash they can invest, which hurts Bitcoin and of course any other investment, aka scarcity. The lottery winning days are over for Bitcoin. If you bought $1k worth of BTC when it was trading at $1, sure you would be worth $7.5 million as of writing. If you invest $1k now, Bitcoin has to reach $15k for you to make a 100% return. As Bitcoin climbs higher, there is far less price discovery relative to stocks. With stocks, there are always new companies vying to become the next Amazon, Apple, etc. in terms of market cap. With Bitcoin, everyone says all other crypto are "shitcoins", thus Bitcoin is the de facto investment, there are no worthwhile alternatives. Thus, you are better off finding alternative investments for your fiat cash. 
The investment phase is mostly over for the average American. You could "invest" $1k and BTC could very well go to $15k a coin and you *could* make a better return relative to stocks. Most of the price magic with Bitcoin is due to its lack of intrinsic value. There is no price floor to Bitcoin, but of course there is no ceiling. In most cases, stocks have intrinsic values in tangible assets that can be liquidated or in intellectual property rights, thus the price of stock will reflect that at some point. Bitcoin is driven purely on supply and demand and the willingness of market participants. It just so happens there is a buyer willing to pay whatever amount of money for a whole bitcoins or a fraction of it. IMO, the single greatest determinant of BTC's price is the ability to divide it down to 0.00000001 decimals places. In theory, this makes it much more accessible as you don't have to fork out $7.5k for a whole coin. Which, in theory, could make the actual supply 2.1 quadrillion. You can just buy $50 worth. But again, the longer you hold off buying BTC, the less you can buy investment wise.
Now, using it as a currency is a different story.

The paper does not have value, but it's "backed" by the economy of the USA, which happens to be one of the strongest in the world.

Personally, I think crypto will be used for money transfers once the speed improves greatly, but it will be used more like the internet protocols. As it stands with the volatility, it makes little sense to use it as a currency for business use. What business would want to take a loss if Bitcoin's fiat value were to plunge during a transaction? We have seen flash crashes, so there is too much risk involved. Thus, the trading of it on exchanges must be largely eliminated.

Just look at the trades on an exchange and look at the USD amounts being bought and the price of BTC. Of course, as the price of BTC goes up, your fiat cash becomes worth less against Bitcoin, as you can only buy a smaller piece of the pie. in 2011 you could have bought 100 BTC for $100, now you can only get 0.0119 of a BTC for $100.

That is why Bitcoin was able to hit $20k. It's fractional nature makes it accessible to anyone. If it wasn't divisible, it wouldn't be trading at $20k a coin. Thus, its true supply should be 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis. The small transactions and trading keep the whales afloat...

"Responding to the concerns of members, the FSB has undertaken a review of the financial stability risks posed by the rapid growth of crypto-assets. The FSB’s initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time. The market continues to evolve rapidly, however, and this initial assessment could change if crypto-assets were to become significantly more widely used or interconnected with the core of the regulated financial system. For example, wider use and greater interconnectedness could, if it occurred without material improvements in conduct, market integrity and cyber resilience, pose financial stability risks through confidence effects. *The FSB will identify metrics for enhanced monitoring of the financial stability risks posed by crypto-assets and update the G20 as appropriate*[emphasis added].
*Crypto-assets raise a host of issues around consumer and investor protection, as well as their use to shield illicit activity and for money laundering and terrorist financing*[emphasis added]. At the same time, the technologies underlying them have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of both the financial system and the economy. Relevant national authorities have begun to address these issues. Given the global nature of these markets, *further international coordination is warranted* [emphasis added], supported by international organisations such as the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, Financial Action Task Force and International Organization of Securities Commissions."

I find it funny that it seems like everyone thinks the price of Bitcoin moves completely on its own, independent of buyers and sellers. They make it seems like HODLing will get it to $50k then the next price target.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:07:29
Because if the board wasn't bullish, then no one would be buying it since Bitcoin's price relies purely on the demand and willingness of someone to exchange fiat cash for it. 
Easily the greatest criticism of Bitcoin is that nowhere in Satoshi's white paper do they mention exchanging fiat cash for Bitcoins on exchanges. That is why Satoshi's addresses have never moved. It's the middlemen trying the make a quick buck off people trading Bitcoin. Bitcoin is supposed the be a self-sustained currency, independent of fiat valuations.

Big companies won't be accepting it anytime soon so long as the volatility remains. It doesn't make sense for a business to accept Bitcoin when it's value could plunge during a transaction or before they can turn it into fiat cash. Satoshi never mentioned anything about trading Bitcoin for fiat cash in the White Paper since that defeats Bitcoin's purpose. Bitcoin is supposed to be the currency with no fiat value associated with it.
The government can impose regulations in the way of forbidding businesses from accepting crypto currencies.

What we're seeing now is businesses building their own in house solutions and I'm pretty sure the banks are pulling a fast one on us. The big banks are obviously developing their own tech which is what we will be using in the future because you'll have the relative safety of the bank keeping your saving safe vs keeping your own coins safe which could be hacked or forgotten and never recovered again.

The crypto technology is not a scam, the trading of it it. Bitcoin's price is predicated upon its fractional nature, making it accessible to nearly anyone. You can buy $5 worth or $500k worth regardless of its market price. Thus, $5 trades support its $9.3k per coin price point. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:51:47
The price is reflecting impending regulation. Obviously, we have no idea in what form regulation will come. Either the regulation won't be as strict as we think it is, which will be good for crypto, or it will be worse, which will severely hamper current prospects.

The pyramid nature comes from its divisibility. You buy 1 coin at $10k, then when you sell at a higher price, it is divided so two people buy half a coin at, let's say, $5.05k. Whole coin cost is now $10.1k. If Bitcoin wasn't divisible, it wouldn't be trading at $20k.

Obviously, who knows where the price will lead to. But people seem to forget that as the price increases, those who are late to the game will see less in the way of returns. Bitcoin still needs fiat to be worth something. The reason why people are investing is so they can cash out in fiat later. They say all the altcoins are shit, but people buy those because they want to turn a small amount of money into millions.

If anything crypto and blockchain will make the banks even stronger as they will force us to use their own versions at some point. You see in the headlines about companies using blockchain, but they never seem to mention using Ethereum or other blockchain variants. Banks also underwrite businesses and take on risks that most people don't want to take (for better or for worse). They also protect your money in the event of fraud. With crypto, you are all on your own if you lose it via being hacked or forgetting your passwords. Unless you plan on underwriting businesses with your own money, banks aren't going anywhere.

Millennial entitlement 101
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:07:11
Well, I suppose it really is a bit of both socialism and libertarianism.
Why is it entitlement though? Given that Bitcoin doesn't produce anything, or directly create jobs, it is more or less a hot commodity that people are willing to pay money for to own. Yes, you can use it to buy stuff with, but the overall mentality is to HODL so it goes to the moon. Now, when you see and read about people getting rich off cryptocurrencies making "easy" money, you're most likely going to want a piece of the action because of FOMO. Of course, there are always people who buy into it late in the game, but they still hope they too can become rich (subjective of course). Now of course, you're probably thinking: "Well this is no different than missing out on a stock that has risen in value more than others". The difference is that *if* Bitcoin were to become a global currency, then its price discovery is eliminate. There would be no buying low and selling high and vice versa since there would be no competition for it. With stocks, there is constantly a churn of new companies vying to take over their rivals with a few succeeding and many failing. 
Of course, if Bitcoin were to become worth millions in fiat cash, then the earliest adopters would essentially become central banks and probably the most powerful people in the world since they got in early enough to hold most of the supply. That's not really decentralization now is it? More or less, as the Who put it, it is: "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss"

Price discovery doesn't exist with Bitcoin, assuming you believe is has pure exponential growth and that everyone will use it someday as the de facto standard. Why? because when its price keeps on going up, people who didn't invest early enough miss out just because you weren't born early enough. With other asset classes like stocks, you can miss out on the Googles and Amazons, but there are always other stocks vying for global dominance that you can invest in. If Bitcoin replaces everything and wipes out all other crypto, then it can never be under or overvalued.

True, but the agreement usually has a basis. If the US economy does well, which is quantifiable for the most part, then its dollar will be stronger. Of course, developing nations have weak currency because their economies are weak. What is Bitcoin really based off to determine its strength? You still have to exchange fiat for it, every price increase in Bitcoin makes your fiat you are holding worth less. 
Bitcoin won't be used for small time transactions as long as it's fees are high. Perhaps some new coin will somehow eliminate fees completely and people will shift to that.

It's not money because it's too volatile. Furthermore, everyone HODLs expecting its price to go up.

Yes, speculation driven by its accessibility. If Bitcoin wasn't divisible, do you think people would be willing to fork out $20k for a whole coin?  Of course, its divisibility was arbitrarily determined along with its supply. Take a look at some of the exchanges and the USD value being traded and the price of a Bitcoin. It's the people putting in chump change like $100 or $1000 into Bitcoin that supports the whole coin price thinking they'll become a millionaire someday.

It's somewhat paradoxical. There has to be a belief that the price will increase, so people will "invest" in it. Yet, you have to exchange fiat for it. As the price increases, your fiat becomes worth less, you get less Bitcoin for your cash. It's not a pyramid scheme though. Pyramids schemes only apply to newly created altcoins where the developers essentially give themselves some of the coin for "development costs", then they hope the markets bids up the price and then they unload it.

$83k is a good sum of money, but the average debt it $137k. When I'm talking about life changing, I'm talking about never having to work again kind of money which is $1mil+ depending on your lifestyle. Like most other investments, but particularly with Bitcoin, diminishing returns set in. When the ability to make a life changing amount of money is gone, you're going to look for other investments.

The technology is not a scam, the trading of it is a scam. Nowhere in Satohi's white paper do they mention trading Bitcoin for fiat cash and which is why Satoshi's addresses haven't moved. Trading it for fiat defeats the purpose of Bitcoin.

Technically dividends reduce the share price of a stock the day it is issued. Thus, you are not really receiving free money. The businesses assumes that the cash they have can no longer be used for growth and it better off in the hands of the investor. Forks could be seen as a dividend and thus reduces the value of Bitcoin. There is now a greater supply of a Bitcoin clone and can also be seen as dilution which further devalues Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:02:45
It depends entirely on why you were using Bitcoin. If you were using it to launder money or for illegal activities, then regulation isn't good. If Bitcoin's price was manipulated to its $20k a coin ATH, then regulation isn't good. Of course, we have no idea in what form regulation will come. Regulation might help curb volatility, but it might not help a rapid price increase anytime soon.

When it's being exchanged for fiat cash and its price is incredibly volatile, it cannot be currency. Does it really make sense to buy something when there is a chance you could lose out on a sudden price jump during your transaction? Does it make sense for a business to accept a currency that could plunge during a transaction and thus making their transaction unprofitable? The trading of Bitcoin on exchange  is never what was intended by Satoshi, that is why their addresses have never been touched. Bitcoin is the currency in of itself, valued not by the fiat cash you are willing to exchange for it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:32:54

Stocks that don't pay a dividend typically reinvest their cash e.g Amazon.

Holding Bitcoin afaik, does not produce anything other than the assumption that people will be willing to pay a higher price for it in the future.

Yes, Satoshi can move Bitcoin around to other accounts without exchanging it for fiat cash, but it is rather clear that Satoshi doesn't believe in exchanging it for fiat cash because the addresses haven't moved even with its skyrocketing price and fall.

It would seem to be "never too late to invest", but as the price increases, you need more money to invest. The average person doesn't have 10k to invest to make a return that they can retire on. Obviously, everyone has a different investing goals. But as the price increases, people are going to be looking at different opportunities.

To be honest, I have no idea. I'm just going to assume someone smarter than me will figure that out. What I'm trying to say is that we are going to make physical cash illegal and go all digital at some point. Blockchain will make this happen. The banks will control the amount of digital cash available and the rate of inflation (if that would even be needed then).
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:59:36
Crypto is the future, but what has Satoshi really done? He hasn't created jobs directly, or for the most part changed anyone's life other than the handful who were lucky enough to own enough Bitcoin to become wealthy.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:24:53
I'm just saying that when the price gets higher, fewer people will want to invest because the chance of making life changing money decreases. Buying $500 worth when Bitcoin was at $1 would be worth $3mil now. A $500 investment at $500k a coin would mean Bitcoin would have to hit $1mil just to turn your $500 into $1k.
And there is already a small pool of people who have the kind of money now to make a life changing amount of money with Bitcoin at $6k. If it were to get to $500k, people are going to look for better opportunities for a higher return.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:40:09
What about Japan's deflation problems?
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:36:29
It will certainly keep running, but at what price point? It could still keep running at $1 a coin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:11:53
$500k price point would take massive institutional trading, increased business use, and easier access to Bitcoin. However, 63% of Americans can't come up with $500 to cover an emergency. Which would explain why only 43% of Americans own stocks. Unless you have a tonne of money to invest, buying into Bitcoin now won't give you a life changing amount of money which would be roughly retirement money at $1mil+ depending on your lifestyle and age. Thus, at the ever increasing price points, there is less incentive to invest for "life changing" money especially for poor people. 
If you invest $1k now, Bitcoin has to hit $12k for a 100% return. For Bitcoin to hit $500k it has to increase 8300% now. So if  you manage to scrape together $1k to invest now and it increases 8300%, you'll have an $83k profit, which is a good chunk of change, but not quite life changing. Then if Bitcoin some how does reach $500k, and you invest $1k at the time, Bitcoin then has to reach $1 mil for a 100% return. So, you can see, there will be less interest in investing when your odds of making a life changing amount of money diminish significantly. 
If you are lucky to have accumulated 1000 Bitcoin, I think that at $10k you will start to see massive sell offs at which point those who have 1000 Bitcoin would be satisfied with their $10mil.
Now, the problem with HODL is that no one is readily willing to use Bitcoin as a currency under the assumption the price will continue to rise, thus, if everyone is HODLing, then as a currency, deflation kicks in like in Japan. No one wants to buy goods using Bitcoin, the price of goods drop and continues to fall. So can Bitcoin be both an investment like a stock while still being a currency? Does it make sense to use spend Bitcoin when its price could increase 10% or more in one day? Does it make sense as a business to accept Bitcoin when its price drops 10% or more in one day? Hedging can only help so much. 
There also seems to be a tendency to view inflation as something that is bad for the economy. Steady inflation is good because it gets people out to spend their money. Of course, this assumes that wage inflation keeps up as the money supply increases. If a fixed supply of money is used and the price is based on supply and demand, and the expectation that the price continues to increase, then we hold off on purchases for longer. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:22:26
I'm going to assume that the next "big one" and its benefits over Bitcoin will be readily seen and there will be a stampede to cash out. It will achieve "critical mass" quickly. Being first is good, but doesn't guarantee anything in tech.

@_date: 2017-10-22 18:23:39
Well, the thing is, Bitcoin is of course divisible, so that has certainly contributed to its price increase. Unless you think Bitcoin is going to hit $1 million per coin, then the lottery winning days are over. It's getting to the price levels where most people simply can't afford to buy a whole coin. With every price increase, your fiat becomes worth less. 63% of Americans can't come up with $500 for an emergency. Only 43% invest in stocks. People are going to go where they think returns will be better. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:23:49

You could still buy $5 worth of Bitcoin then as you can buy $5 worth of Bitcon now. It's the small transactions that prop up the price. If Bitcoin wasn't divisible, there's no way it would be trading at its $20k a coin ATH.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:02:17

If fiat were eliminated, there is nothing to base the price off of it. People are only buying BTC because they expect it to rise, so they can cash it out for fiat at a given date. However, every time the price increases, your fiat becomes worth less, the returns are poorer.

Bitcoin itself or the technology is not a Ponzi scheme. However, the trading of it--more or less--is a Ponzi. You buy it assuming that someone will pay more for it later on, much like art. Its fiat price determination is mostly based on collective socialism. *If you buy it and I buy it and everyone else buys it, we can call get rich* And if you're concerned about the fiat price of bitcoin, you're doing it wrong because it means you're really not a believer in the tech.

@_date: 2017-10-22 16:53:39
Bitcoin's growth is based purely on supply and more importantly, the demand for it. If someone wants to fork out $6k of fiat for a coin, then that is the price of it. Bitcoin doesn't produce anything or have any return other than what someone is willing to pay.
That being said, if you want to use it as a currency, then you can buy it, but IMO it's stuck in some odd position as an investment like stocks but it also wants to be used as a currency. The two uses of it can't really coexist. To be used as a currency, it must be less volatile and essentially cease to increase in price rapidly. Then if that happens, people stop seeing it as a get rich quick scheme, so they stop buying it and look for other growth.

How much some is willing to pay for a Bitcoin with fiat is the sole determinant of the price of Bitcoin. What happens if fiat were eliminated from society and Bitcoin was only accepted?
As the price increases, there is little incentive to invest because the potential for any returns is significantly less in Bitcoin's fixed system. While stocks may have lower returns, there are numerous stocks to invest in, unlike Bitcoin where everyone wants it to be the only currency and everything else is "shitcoin". Thus, late adopters own less Bitcoin than others as the prices increases. Whereas with stocks, there are continually new and emerging business that may or may not succeed, but they still provide opportunity for growth. So of course, the "ideal" investor, buys low and sells high, constantly finding new stocks to invest in with their given fiat currency. Unless, you assume Bitcoin's price will increasingly infinitely, (which opens up a whole different set of problems), then every time you exchange fiat for for BTC, your investment is worth less than it used to be. 
People buy the "shitcoins" to chase Bitcoin like returns, buying large quantities of the coin with the expectation the price will increase e.g. retirement money, but we all know that isn't going to happen.

If I own it or do not own it, it does not matter. People have unrealistic expectations with Bitcoin. Obviously, you can still make money off trading it, and I can't say what kind of return someone should be happy with. But, when I see these "to the moon" people, I can't help but feel they are setting themselves up for disappointment. The days of making life changing money from a small amount are over. Every price increase reduces it's return potential. People will be looking to put their fiat to better use somewhere else.

Well, that is difficult to determine. You can certainly make money off crypto while it's still hot.
First thing first though is to learn about wallets and encryption and not being scammed. Learning to enable 2 factor authentication is important. You'll want to probably get a hardware wallet if you are investing more than $10k and make sure everything is backed up and secure. If you screw up with crypto, all is lost and no one can help.

The only thing that will get Bitcoin to $500k is serious institutional trading and newfound utility for it. Anyone buying into bitcoin now will not have the kind of cash to make a life changing amount of money. Remember, 63% of Americans can't come up with $500 to cover an emergency so they sure as hell won't be buying Bitcoin even with its divisibility.

Bitcoin can't really be a store of value since every price increase means your fiat becomes worth less; your fiat buys a smaller slice of pie. Early adopters will reap the rewards. Late comers will have to exchange even more fiat to make a decent return. It's only worth as much as the fiat someone is willing to pay for it. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:56:20
Not going to happen mate. The higher the price, the fewer people are going to be willing to fork out cash for it. Of course Bitcoin is divisible, but at $1 mil no one will be using it to invest in since the returns would be non-existent. It would have to hit $2mil for a 100% return.

It means the markets are going to become even more volatile. ETFs aren't really good for the stock markets when the markets are increasingly being purchased by institution that create the ETFs. In other words, they are only really "smart" when few people are indexing which was about 25 years ago. Furthermore, you're going to probably pay a costly Management Expense Ratio on a bitcoin etf, which reduces performance over the long term versus buying it yourself. The ETF providers make money regardless of bitcoin's performance, and of course, it doesn't pay a dividend. There are also concerns about what would happen if a fork occurred. Who gets the money? Will the institution keep all of it?

Very true. Gold ETF providers usually give people a run around when they are asked about how much gold they actually have in reserve. Furthermore, a bitcoin ETF would destroy its use as a currency.

You seem to assume that people are just going to buy Bitcoin because its fiat value is rising, as in everyone who participates will get rich. You don't have to invest in stocks or you can choose different stocks to invest in. Bitcoin will probably lead to even greater wealth inequality. The "buy now and get rich" is just a pump by the whales who will own our asses. At some point, since they are the largest holders, they'll own everyone if Bitcoin were to become some global currency that everyone has to use.

The crypto mania could be seen as a symptom of the current stock market bull run. With stocks markets reaching new highs, people are going to think that returns won't get much higher for a while. Thus, they'll pump money into crypto thinking they will get higher returns. Bitcoin could crash hard if people have been borrowing "cheap" money to buy bitcoin on leverage. If the stock market crashes, that usually means unemployment rises, and if you don't have a job, you won't be able to make your payments. I don't think buying bitcoin given its extreme volatility would be a good thing to buy vs buying food and paying rent. Even gold imploded during the 2008 recession.

When you think about it, Bitcoin does nothing to prevent fractional reserve banking. For you see, fractional reserve banking is all done "on paper", as in using more than you actually hold. Even if a bank holds $1 000 000 worth of Bitcoin, they could still lend out $5 000 000 of "paper money".

Hodling is flawed logic. People carry this from the stock markets where they think that if you go long, you can't lose. However, that only applies to the market itself and not any individual stock.

People are misunderstanding the concept of thinking long term because they look at the stock markets and see an "up trend". But where they get confused is that the markets is a collection of stocks. Overtime stocks get removed because they go out of business or poor performance. Thus, the markets are affected by surviorship bias. Amazon survived the Dotcom Bubble, but pets.com did not. Bitcoin is not the market. Is it a single entity among thousands of other cryptocurrencies. It is very well possible that a superior crypto will dethrone Bitcoin. Going long is flawed reasoning when applied to a single entity.

Understanding something doesn't mean you'll make money. Investments firms spend millions on "understanding" businesses and yet they rarely beat the markets.

Bitcoin doesn't make money or produce anything all it does it facilitate a secure transaction that a stable coin could do. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:23:05

While you do bring up the point that some coins might be worthless and have no value assigned to them, I'm assuming that with the relative ease of forking a project and improving upon it, would certainly reduce the price of the previous iteration. Forks are easily the greatest threat to Bitcoin. I understand that it is not identical to the original, but this in *essence* is printing more crypto, given that you receive an equal amount of crypto from the fork. We have clearly seen a struggle between Bcash and Bitcoin. Bcash is evidently also assigned a fiat value and can still pose a threat to Bitcoin so I'm not exactly making any assumptions. I can see problems further down the road if this were to continue as the indecision among investors with their limited fiat cash will have to decide what to bet on. Even if the entire ecosystem rises, Bitcoin's price could be still worth more if those crypto never existed since it would be proportional.
 While argument is going to sound circular here, my main point is the price of crypto being affected by the limited quantity of fiat cash that the vast majority of people possess. As I mentioned before in another post, the higher the price of Bitcoin goes in its fiat value, the poorer we become, given that late adopters either by choice or even by the misfortune of being born too late will miss out on buying Bitcoin cheap to own a significant share, again with their limited amount of fiat cash. The early adopters essentially become the new versions of a central bank because they control the majority of it and can thus dictate who they give it to or what they use it for. None of this would be a problem if Bitcoin and other crypto wasn't given a fiat value, because the crypto is valued without the use of traditional fiat valuation.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:39:45
When no fiat value is assigned to them, yes each coin is unique and subjected to their supply limits. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:06:26

It means that the price of Bitcoin is pointless and largely detracts from the importance of its use as a monetary transactional technology.

I don't think anyone has ever said printing money is a perfect system, but I think it is the best fit for our current global economy. That is why we have, ideally, steady inflation targets. The world hasn't really seen inflation for the past 10 years, even after all that printing, just look at Japan. A fixed supply where the supply can be literally be destroyed is too much of a risk. Human error, or natural disasters (solar flares) could wipe out digital currencies. If you want to do border less transactions, a stable coin makes much more sense for a simple 1:1 transaction. I'm not sure if I would accept Bitcoin from someone when its value could plummet, or on the contrary, its value could rise during the transaction.
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:33:27

Say you bought a Bitcoin when it was trading at $1. You Hodl it until it is the current market price, you sell it for fiat or to use it to buy something. Now you have to pay more to own the same amount of Bitcoin. Anyone born too late to buy early, or just anyone who didn't buy it, is now poorer if it were to become some "global currency". Bitcoin would ultimately lead to even greater wealth inequality because of its lack of price discovery if it were to replace all currencies. It's priced is based on nothing more than collective socialism: if you buy it, and I buy it, and everyone else buys it, we can all get rich. Yet, the earliest Hodlers will have the late adopters by the balls as they are now the new central banks that could hypothetically control who they sell to.
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:04:58

Using a fixed supply monetary system would significantly slow down economic growth. It could, in theory, reduce the volatility of economic cycles, but would cause severe limits on productivity. Banks are a necessary evil as they provide large amounts of capital for businesses and individuals to take on entrepreneurial risks.

The only thing bitcoin and blockchain have going for it are their ability to record information and to allow for secure transactions. That is what I believe in. I don't believe in trading it for fiat cash. Interestingly, Satoshi never mentions actually exchanging Bitcoin for fiat cash in the white paper, nor does Satoshi mention Bitcoin ever becoming some "global currency". The white paper is primarily focused on the secure P2P transaction of money without the need for an intermediary. Per usual the middlemen (crypto exchanges), thought it was a good idea to start trading it so they can get a cut of the transactions.

But those currencies aren't seen as investments. Because Bitcoin and other altcoins have a fiat value assigned to them, you have to use your hard earned and scarce fiat cash to buy them. Thus, you have to make a decision on where to allocate your money. As more crypto currencies are created or "printed", further dilution occurs due to your own scare decision making. The higher the prices go, the more you are going to lean into buying altcoins as they offer a better perceived opportunity for growth of your scarce fiat cash holdings.

You don't need a price increase to make it stable. Furthermore, this does not take into account of the consumer price index.

It's a bear market for those who buy at the peaks and take a kick to the stomach when it declines. If you bought at $20k a coin, you're still gong to feel like shit because you could have bought Bitcoin 70% cheaper if you waited. Remember, people only have so much cash to invest. There's really not much of a point of investing in Bitcoin if it were to hit $500k a coin. What's a poor man going to do? Put $100 in and hope Bitcoin hit $1 000 000 to make to turn $100 into $200?

To an extent, and depending where you live, your cash holdings are insured by the bank from at least losses stemming from your account being hacked. But now since you are your own bank, you have to deal with your own security problems, which for some can be a headache. Furthermore, you're now relying on the developers, exchanges, and market not to erode your wealth. If Bitcoin were to implode further, you're not going to feel to good about it. But you see if it were to "moon", then all you really care about is its fiat value because securing your money from bank runs and corruption can all be done without Bitcoin's fiat value. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:30:26

@_date: 2018-04-29 20:08:28
Stability, in the short run at least, would deter the speculators looking for the "moon" in fiat terms. But of course, without a fiat value, then yes Bitcoin would be stable, assuming coins aren't continually "lost" which would tighten the supply. If you use a stable coin "backed" by the USD, then you can still forgo the banks as an intermediary for transactions or as a place to store your wealth without the worrying of buying Bitcoin at $20k a coin only to see it drop to $6k. But as you said, you are only looking to accumulate, so fiat price shouldn't really matter, but should the price continue to rise, the poorer you become since your fiat is now worth less relative to Bitcoin.

Are you buying Bitcoin to increase you fiat worth? If you are, then you are looking to make a profit. If it goes down in fiat value, then you are losing money. If you don't care about fiat value, then congrats, you are on the right track with the idea of Bitcoin. But what I meant was that "understanding" something doesn't really mean anything. Investment firms spend millions on acquiring information about businesses to "understand" them, and yet they rarely beat the markets.

A currency is not backed by the government, it's backed by the fundamentals of the economy. The currency is just a representation of  it and is created by the government. That being said, you are still being paid in fiat and Bitcoin is still valued in fiat and you have a scarce amount of fiat cash to invest with.

HODLing is derived from the concept of "going long on a stock" and to ignore any short term price fluctuations, even if you are losing money, with the intent of making money in the long run. However, this is flawed because companies/assets can go to zero at any time for any reason. If you go on long on the market itself, then you are protected to an extent because the market contains a number of stocks. The organizations that make the indexes replace stocks that are performing poorly or have gone out of business. Thus, surviorship bias helps the "market" appear to only keep going up in the long run. Bitcoin is not the market, it is an individual asset among thousand of other crypto assets.

"**I've hodled BTC good for a year. But it has been difficult seeing us go from 20k, 16k, 8k, 6k and I started wondering if I should paus my money in fiat to wait out this bear market and not loose even more.** I spent days listening to Tone Vays, Richard Heart etc. They all were super bearish telling how the price will go to 5k at any moment now.
Now we're closing in at 9k and I still haven't bought back my BTC that I sold at ~6700 (the bottom) . Feeling like a total idiot.
Technical analysis is bullshit. They only draw lines that follow the current trend to tell where we're going from here. They are right until the trend reverses. You can never trust this with decisions on when to buy or sell. **Hodl it is from now on.**"

It's not just backed by government, but the economy the currency it represents e.g. GDP and its ability to pay off debt, political stability which are quantifiable metrics. So either, the economy tanks, and the currency weakens, or the economy improves and the currency "strengthens". There are zero fundamentals to Bitcoin's price determination other than people are buying because they assume someone will pay more fiat cash for it later on. Besides, currencies are generally not seen as speculative investments and are relatively stable. Bitcoin is arguably even more centralized than fiat cash. Central banks can print all the money they want, but they don't necessarily "own" the currency. Bitcoin on the other hand is owned by the major miners and by the earliest adopters who own the bulk of Bitcoin in existence. When you own something that other people want, you can get them to do what you want for it.

@_date: 2018-04-28 20:27:41
To be fair, it would appear to be slowly gaining adoption, but I don't see how using Bitcoin confers any advantages over using a stable coin. If you use a stable coin, you can still bypass the banks and businesses like Bitpay as an intermediary for transactions without the volatility that affects Bitcoin, which I would assume, would greatly affect how your business would operate, especially if your margins are low.

Index funds can be a basket of whatever stocks the fund managers want to include, but there are index funds that track the markets such as the Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Total Market index funds that include every single stock. 
When you bet on only Bitcoin, you are competing against the market of other crypto that are eating away at Bitcoin's return potential.

That's because it's pure emotion. There aren't any fundamental drivers in price. You are just buying it assuming that someone will pay more for it later down the road.

Like I said, as long as Bitcoin and other have a fiat value assigned to them and given that people only have so much fiat cash to invest with, the creation of superior altcoins will errode Bitcoin's price. Now, if Bitcoin and altcoins didn't have a fiat valuation, then that would be a different story. Bitcoin cannot be a currency and investment at the same time.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:43:50
Bitcoin would lead to even greater wealth inequality, assuming that all early adopters HODL. Anyone who is out of luck just because they weren't born early enough to buy it is shit out of luck. You would be forced to buy Bitcoin at is increasingly inflated cost, and owning a smaller portion of it each time the price increases.
 Of course, you're probably thinking: "Well, I also wasn't around to buy Microsoft stock", but of course, there is a constant new crop of stocks coming out looking to invest in, and of course, hindsight is 20/20. Whereas with Bitcoin, if a new tech comes along to "invest" in, then everyone will sell Bitcoin for Newcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:59:13

It's possible I might have missed it, but it would appear that Satoshi himself never mentions exchanging fiat cash for Bitcoin through exchanges. It would also explain why Satoshi's addresses have never moved, as using fiat to value and purchase Bitcoin defeats its intended purpose. 
People here seem to think that everyone has an infinite amount of hard earned fiat cash to use to buy crypto with when that is clearly not the case. We have already seen the influx of altcoins (aka shitcoins) erode Bitcoin's price. If no altcoins existed, of course everyone's fiat cash would be directed into Bitcoin and its fiat price would most likely be substantially higher. To repeat what I have said early differently, as more crypto continues to be created, we must choose where to invest our *scarce* fiat cash. Thus, even while all crypto are similar, but not identical, the expanding totality of the their supplies will continue to erode Bitcoin's price.

The physical cash you carry is essentially worthless, but it is nonetheless "backed" by the strength of country's economy in which it is printed. Bitcoin is not backed by anything, so it does not have an intrinsic price floor or ceiling. Of course, the irony is that Bitcoin is valued in fiat, which defeats its purpose. You have to go way back in history to when we were still using gold as a currency to see how Bitcoin would work in an economy. I don't think anyone has ever said that fiat printing is perfect, but it nonetheless has helped to accelerate the global economy (with booms and busts) more than using gold ever could.

What would BTC be without the USD?
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:59:11
He's talking about user base. Visa is a $290b company because it provides a service and tries to make money off you when you miss your payments and through fees. It's a completely different valuation than bitcoin, they can't be compared. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:27:20
There's still something fishy going on since they won't come out and release everything for bean counters. If they don't have anything to hide, then why not release some actual hard evidence? Even, let's say they do have the cash to "backup" all these tethers they have created, are they up to some other illegal acts outside of crypto, or have they found some other way to pump bitcoin while making it look like they have 1:1 backing?

All price action logic is based on the assumption that markets are not heavily rigged and manipulated by whales, bots, and exchange collusion. Now of course, most of you will cry out that so are other assets, which is true, but there is no governance or lawmen coming after if you do full blown wash trading on crypto markets. Thus if crypto manipulation is widespread, this $20k peak would be a mirage because most of the demand would have been driven by wash trading tactics. In others words, they made it seem like there was more demand than there actually is. Furthermore, don't start giving out financial advice like bitcoin is a "great long term" investment, bitcoin like any other asset can crash 50% or more for no reason at all. Stocks go down all the time and most never achieve the levels they did before or go bust. Bitcoin is no different.

You're assuming crypto prices are supported by actual supply and demand, and not mostly manipulated by whales. Furthermore, most buyers of crypto are probably just as ignorant of those people who hate it. Most ICOs are outright scams, bitcoin and maybe a couple others aren't.

It is, but the country is poorly managed. In other words, inflation is a symptom of a poorly run economy, not a cause.

The only reason why the Bolivar of Venezuela went to shit is the because the country is run by a dictator, and they have numerous sanctions placed on them limiting their trade with other countries. If you think the US economy is really going to implode to make the dollar go to zero, then you would be better off buying guns and meal kits, because the global economy is going to shit and everyone is going to be out of a job. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:18:29
Why? Because they create stablecoins out of thin air in exchange for actual dollars. Then, the companies use that cold hard cash and put it to work by investing it in bonds, stocks, etc. to generate interest which is, ideally, pure profit for them. What I think the Tether dudes have done, is they got lucky enough to generate enough profit to have roughly enough cash on hands at convenient times to make it look like they have a 1:1 cash to tether ratio. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:51:21
No need to keep calling me names here. I know what liquidity is, I just can't see why Tom is comparing Bitcoin to Visa when the two are quite different. Furthermore, as you said yourself, why is he comparing a fixed supply currency to Visa which has a hypothetical infinite supply? People can also create as many wallets as they want just like people can get as many credit cards as they want.

The problem with bitcoin is: why spend or take on risk when you can just hodl?
@_date: 2018-12-24 06:23:29
It has daily use, just no one wants to use it because they don't want to end up like the dude who spent 10k BTC on a couple pizzas. If you don't use it, then that hurts its value. It's stuck in a bit of a paradox that way.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:58:22
I don't think a fixed supply currency would have got them out of paying reparations from the Treaty of Versailles. Moreover, they needed to pay reparations through other means such through commodities, would would have strained their fragile economy (right after a major war no less) even more.

Yea, and if all a bank had was bitcoin, it would still collapse if all their clients came to withdraw their bitcoin. Furthermore, bitcoin does absolutely nothing to stop fractional reserve banking. Banks can still lend out more than they hold through the same "IOUs" they use for their current system.

It's too bad bitcoin can't keep you safe from scams or wrongdoings

If the dollar is still around as you imply, then that is dependent on the inflation of the dollar. BTC at $500k a coin won't mean much if a gallon of milk costs $500 and the average person makes $250k a (year through wage inflation)
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:08:19

Of course coinbase wants you to buy. They don't give really give a shit about the current price of bitcoin, they just keep pumping it and promising future riches so you keep buying while they take away cold hard cash via comission mother fucker.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:28:22
I know bitcoin is, the underlying tech, but people seem to think that underlying tech protects them from everything. So in a sense, bitcoin provides a false sense of security.

Lee is using false equivalence in valuing bitcoin. He claims if bitcoin captured only 7% of Visa's user base, it would be worth $150k a coin. If bitcoin is a medium of exchange, how come my plastic credit card isn't worth worth a $2.14mil?

Venezuela is doing poorly because its run by a wannabe socialist dictator and has numerous sanctions placed on them barring trading with other countries.  A blue collar salary a few decades ago could provide for their family because those jobs had a higher value back then. Now, automation is taking over factory work and more training, specialization and intelligence is needed now for higher paying jobs.
