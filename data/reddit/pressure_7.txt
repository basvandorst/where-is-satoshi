Doesn’t your calc mean $50k-$500k?
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:10:19
Realistically the amount of bitcoins is fairly arbitrary
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:53:26
Are we really that close? I’ve heard estimates that it’s still like 18 months away. I worry we get mainstream eyes on bitcoin before it’s ready to scale 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:56:37
You hoard by not selling
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:17:29
That sounds nice. Work needs to get done to make the world go around though
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:40:36
Are you saying that when you typed that out you didn’t realize? Yeesh
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:27:38
It shouldn’t be rushed if compromising quality but it absolutely needs to be figured out as soon as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:35:01
Govs don’t control money? Huh?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:43:09
The stars are still playing tee ball
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:33:35
I very much disagree lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:16:52
Posting in a bitcoin subreddit and disliking hodl is a hard place to be lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:45:23
Decentralization has nothing to do with avoiding taxes at all.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:00:05
Oh my you are quite mean my friend. Take it easy you’ll live longer

I’m an investor not Buzz Lightyear
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:52:25
You seem real fun
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:25:35
Buying in at every all time high before this one has been a wise investment.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:36:26
Yeah at some point referring to the price as mBTC for $10 might help people get over that mental hurdle
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:10:07
Short term capital gains (cashing out after owning for less than a year) are taxed at your normal income (say you’re in the top tax bracket, 39.6%) Capital gains longer than a year are taxed at a rate that less than this, if you are in the highest tax bracket this rate is 20%.
TLDR: hold for longer than a year and pay less taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:32:10
Lol what does that even mean
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:59:25
For $733 you can get 10,000,000 satoshis if that makes you feel better
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:04:38
If you urgently need money it’s always a reasonable time to withdraw. The plan is to avoid being put in that situation
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:54:32
You can invest without investing your life savings that you can’t afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:11:40
Do not tell him to never give you a raise again lol
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:31:51
This is weird
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:00:25
 Can’t decide whether to hold on my Trezor or leave on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:06:35
That was a lot of words to say nothing
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:27:08
That was by far the most reasonable time to get out imo
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:31:18
It could drop significantly or continue going up. The only real consensus is that there will volatility 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:12:38
I’m gonna hold on Trezor through the fork, and once it’s safe transfer forked coins to coinbase and sell B2X
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:25:21
The cap gains tax is an underrated motivator to hold
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:58:51
Huh? One of trumps defining traits is volatility and being unpredictable. You think Trump is stable?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:42:23
In what way is Trump better 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:44:37
when you needed money
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:17:43
These reads like erotic fan fiction
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:32:30
Such a tired statement
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:03:37
If I bought on coinbase before the fork, but my bitcoin isn’t in my wallet until after the fork, do I still get both coins?
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:31:41
Mind fuck
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:31:20
You should probably also have a sellable skill.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:35:25
OP was condescending, he can take a minor rude comment lol
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:32:48
A limited amount protects from inflation. Limited &gt; unlimited
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:36:36
That’s good
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:23:06
Would you rather it be unlimited?
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:30:57
Play nice you two or you’ll be put in time out
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:36:30
Wait this article states bitcoin gold hard fork is happening in Nov? I thought it happened yesterday and S2X might happen in Nov
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:29:34
Damn a drop all the way down to $6300?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:03:28
Lol why the specific numbers
