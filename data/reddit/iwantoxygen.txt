Glad I can read charts and saw the stabilization/consolidation at $3K range sold bought .10000 bitcoin and made bank the other weekend when it jumped to $13K
My only regret was that I didn’t buy more.

Someone should give bitcoin some marijuana so it can go to the moon.

Some kind of app that calculates how many bitcoins you need for a Lamborghini?

Have faith. You bought high in a bubble. You should learn chart Analysis. Just looking at that chart correctly would have told you not to buy.

It’s amazing how Rhodesia once considered the “Jewel of Africa” became Zimbabwe and ended up like this?!

Wasn’t Trump one of the only people to talk to the Feds the first time they went after Epstein? Why would he do that if he had a lot to hide? 
I’m a firm believer in the deep state, have been since sophomore year of high school (2009) when I started reading into JFK and the things he was saying before he got assassinated. I feel like it was the Clinton’s (they know a lot of people who have “committed suicide”) or someone much more powerful.

Missed correcting that I missed a t on thought.

But wasn’t Trump one of the only people that talked when they reached out to associates of Epstein a while ago? Why would he throw himself under the buss. 
If it was a group effort between the two of them and the acting president was involved don’t you think he would of pulled the plug on Epstein before he got arrested?

Does anyone actually think it was Trump?
