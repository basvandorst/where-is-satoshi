He says Bitcoin uses too much energy. Hogwash.
You know what uses a lot of energy? Cars, especially manufacturing them. Rockets use a lot of energy too. And last time I checked, you couldn't dig a tunnel without expending a fuckton of energy.
Elon is the most overrated celebrity of them all. He's never had a truly groundbreaking idea. I'm in the middle of my [game]( but he's just a kid who got lucky with PayPal and (to his credit) used it to do the stuff little boys like to do -- cars, rockets, digging tunnels, etc.

Congrats! But never ever tell anyone how much you own. Especially on the interwebs. Someday you are excited that you own 1btc. And in ten, 20 years this will maybe a huge amount in fiat. Trough very unlucky circumstances you will be hold at gunpoint to give up your private key. Don't tell anyone never! Also, I have a free time so I will take the opportunity to research about exchange that has an advanced mode such as Bitrus. From what I know, you have the chance to get a free trip to Mexico in the finals the world cup of crypto as a prize from that awesome [exchange](

This might be a hot take. But crypto and web browsers don't really belong together, as ironic as that sounds. Got to go now as I am on the quest to find a good trading [bot]( I've learn it thru some [videos]( I am trying to figure out the cons and pros of every trading bot.

State-by-state is how legal and economic innovation is spread in the US. Take gay marriage, legalizing weed... Individual states try stuff (no one to hold them back), if it works then other states follow suit, and often the federal government eventually catches up. This isn't the best time for me to reply since I am still [playing]( but it is one of the many benefits (and, in my opinion, one of the best) of states' rights.

In its announcement, Fidelity Digital Assets said that it realises the transformative potential of digital cash. The company is committed to providing security and a point of access for institutional investors to trade digital assets. The entry of institutional investors into the crypto industry will bring more credibility for the sector. Thus, the role of Fidelity and other financial services firms is crucial for the future of digital currency. Anyway, I am off, I gotta research about Bitrus. I am trying to find the upcoming best [exchanges]( which have a buyback program right now.

 It'll be centralized, which means there's no need for a censorship-resistant system like Bitcoin. It's basically nothing to do with our world. At some point, the people pushing 'tokenized' systems will realize this, and stop pestering us with their tales of how they're going to arrange their databases.

I agree on your point, and also I think that selling btc to get usd or any other fiat is simply stupid. Right now, I am [playing]( but why would anyone exchange better money for worse money?  Just spend btc when you need, don't ever sell any btc for fiat.

It can be distributed but blockchains are not distributed by default. This isn't the best time for me to reply since I am still [playing]( but I think that a blockchain is simply a data structure, in which blocks of data are chained together by including (usually) a hash of the identifier of the previous block in the header of the current block
@_date: 2019-02-05 04:55:46
Oh, my! That's so big, hmm, I wonder if the block size affects the overall size of the blockchain? I assumed transactions will take up the different amount of space.
@_date: 2019-02-05 16:19:47
Oh, thank you for that! I also researched it, and I also discovered that Block size directly impacts the total blockchain growth over time. got to go as my [game]( just finished it's download.
@_date: 2019-02-27 15:33:20
I’m not saying hyperinflation is good, but a stable inflation of 2% does benifit the economy unlike bitcoin, which either only goes up in value, like we all want and therefore make it so that people don’t spend anymore or bitcoin will vade away due to the transaction speed problems and only be used by a few. Got to go as my [game]( just finished its loading.

Do you think if you have the money to fund terrorism you need bitcoin to transfer it? Let's say hypothetically russia is funding some oriental terrorist group, do you really think russia needs bitcoin? Think about it along these lines, if big corp decided to shut you down and out like say how they did to alex jones, and I can't begin to explain how bad it is to wake up to all your bank accounts closed, something that is reserved for shit like active terrorism, serial killers, etc, and he is none of them, officially or not, you WANT to have an alternative system to pay, or else you are stuck to local market and physical cash, also good luck getting any job that pays via bank or checks, or even worse, specific banks only (like I have). I am actually looking for the super trading [platform]( which aim to build a brand that people trust, a brand that is recognizable worldwide through offering our software as a service such as Bittreo. I think that having this mindset is pretty positive and you know that you are in good hands. Going back, I think that, you can pay with bitcoin at a couple online shops, also you can transfer money between two people without transfer taxes. Drug cartels and terrorism have their own channels, and tbh I don't think they'd want to risk with a coin as volatile as bitcoin, also bitcoin brokers to some extent are under local law, if a large influx does come, it will set off red flags. Or so I vaguely remember, it's been a good couple of years

That's exactly my point .. his decision was VERY VERY centralized ... He should have done a poll or something .. I'm happy that this coin got delisted but everyone who cares about blockchain philosophy shouldn't agree with these methods.

I am sure other platforms will find it hard to beat this. Going back, I know we all love CZ but centralizing such power in few hands is what we're running away from ...

I like this one: You agree to have this information shared with the IRS, FBI, CIA, NSA, Federal Reserve, ECB, Interpol, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Equifax, Chainalysis, and your parents. Honestly, I'm in the middle of my appraisal for the wonderful crypto [casino]( where you can stake Bitcoins and chat with live dealers directly on your desktop or mobile device and you'll find a constant stream of bonuses and promotions right now, but I like how btc talk deliver their own April fool joke. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 05:59:22
To be fair most people in crypto still think of it as a get rich quick scheme. I mean how many people bought at 20k then sold at 10k only to never re-enter the market. Now, I am overjoyed to search for an unbelievable crypto [casino]( where you'll find a constant stream of bonuses/promotions and also offers multiple traditional table games and slots plus they also offer fantastic five- and six-figure Bitcoin prizes right now but I think all the people who are still here have known for a while that this is what the market looks like when you zoom out.

Actually, while he's correct that the US can pay any debt it has, that doesn't mean there's a 100% chance that it will. I don't know that there's much chance that the recent debacle would have resulted in defaulting on debt payments. Anyway, I am still searching for a secured [asset]( platform that is built according to the highest standards, audited, and penetration tested right now but there's little doubt that it could have (even though that would have been unconstitutional and therefore ultimately overturned).

Proof-of-work mining is more energy intensive because the economics of it profit large mining centers like bitcoin. Proof-stake-mining favors having a secure desktop wallet that verifies ledgers, spreading the mining capacity out, while also giving owners a return on the verified stake within wallets. This make the coin go back into the hands of the user(rather than to a large mining facility with big $$)and mitigates the possibility for a 51% attack on a ledger. Super interesting economic topic in my mind that I did a paper on for class last year.   Anyway, I am quite fortunate tonight as I check that we had a good revenue share on this magnificent [asset]( platform. I just simply love Darb because it is engineered from the ground up with security, stability, speed, and scalability in mind. I am sure other platforms will find it hard to beat this.

lol I think your statement makes sense. that's also the voice of my doubtful version of me. I am actually checking the status of my crypto on this best trading [platform]( I also love it because it offer discounts on fees for OTC trades such as 20 percent off our OTC fee for the first time a client buys or sells. In this way, I would have to pay a fee less and I’ll earn more money. Going back, I just think my optimistic me is pretty dominant nowadays because of the pump.

Can't this man be brought to court and have to prove unequivocally that he is OR is not satoshi. Evidence like what we are seeing should be brought to bear whether or not he is who he is and if not a class action should be filled against him. Anyhow, I am current selling some of my crypto on this amazing trading [platform]( I just love Bittreo because it has an on-site security for branch transactions to online security for your web and mobile trade. I think that with a secured platform, we can trade with peace of mind.

While I'm no fan of fractional reserve banking, I can't help but recognise one benefit with it, so allow me to play devil's advocate. Fractional reserve banking is probably the only system that allows regular people to own land, outside of overt state control. There is no way any bank would lend you $300,000 over 30 years if that loan had to be 100% backed by real assets. Actually, I am still looking for the grandest upcoming [exchange]( which is a fully regulated platform and abiding by all the rules like Bitrus. From what I remember, you have the chance to get a free trip to Mexico in the finals the world cup of crypto as a prize from that exchange, going back, Owning property without fractional reserve banking would probably be impossible for regular people, and I'm not sure what the solution to that is.

I think so too. I think that though we can’t tell what the future will hold for cryptocurrencies but we can, at the least, guess what direction the crypto industry might take- in a year’s time, in 5 years time and in a decade’s time.
I am still looking for the first massive adoption that will inspire institutional investments and open up a gold mine where values will rise and cryptocurrency will be worth a lot of money. What this means is that cryptocurrencies won’t become a dead investment and, eventually, it will become the major adoptable. So I still firmly believe that we just need to hold on tight and wait for the bright future of crypto's.

Wow! This is a huge giveaway from BitStarz Casino. They are really generous! Love it! In my opinion, this is better than other online casino because the casino is full of exciting games that are divided into different categories named Lobby, Slots, Jackpots, Table Games, and Live Casino. Each of these categories offers a long list of interesting games that can make anyone feel crazy. The casino is offering virtual games that are operated on the SoftSwiss and Amatic platforms which include 3D games on a wide array of themes.
The games offered at this online casino are really wonderful to play and give a lot of enjoyment. The most popular among these are Bells on Fire, Eye of Ra and Platinum Lightning. There are also a lot of games that include table games like Caribbean Poker, Live Casino Hold’em, Multihand Blackjack, Trey Poker, Live Baccarat, American Roulette, French Roulette, and more, to be played live. The most interesting part is the mobile games that you can play with your mobile devices anywhere and anytime.
From what I know, BitStarz Casino is also the first online casino in the world, providing premium live games from Evolution Gaming for both BTC and other major currencies. This is actually one of my favorites aside from [Vegas casino]( By the way, Will you accept more crypto's in the future?
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:27:31
Sorry to hear that, mate. :( It's really hard to choose an online casino but I think it is easier when you have some kind of framework to start from. You should, of course, have your own list of must-have’s when evaluating an online casino. This might be as specific as the availability of a certain game or game type.
When you do settle on an online casino, I recommend depositing only a small amount of money there, to begin with. See how things go with the property as a customer, and gradually increase the amount of money you trust the site with over time. I am currently playing at your recommended casino, and I'd say the deposit instruction are very easy to follow, even if you don't have any crypto wallet. Did I also mention that they have an amazing 100% welcome bonus?
