Looks like Bitfinex really caked their pants.

How can we, innocent commenters, be sure that isn't going for the long troll?

The initiation of the final phase of the start of the commencement of the beginning has finally taken off.

It would be benificial for the trucoinrt site — if they match the stealth orders internally.
An example:
trader 1 makes a stealth buy order of 1 a-coin at a price of 100 b-coin per a-coin (paying in effect 100 b-coin for 1 a-coin)
trader 2 makes a stealth sell order of 1 a-coin at a price of 80 b-coin per a-coin (buying in effect 80 b-coin for 1 a-coin)
the site can then match the two trades and gain 20 b-coin per a-coin traded (in this case 20 b-coin).

Hypothetical customer sends me $1 $million $USD dollar and I give you 1 bitcoin and yo... hypothetical customer has just bought $1 $million $USD dollar worth of bitcoin.

I just went onto the streets and talked to 100 people about bitcoin and guess what? A quarter of the people said they heard about bitcoin and the majority said they trust it, which confirmed my suspicions about this matter.

Which comes down to €1.811,-/month after taxation or ~20 BTC/month.

Which legal reasons would that be?

If they can not even regulate their own deflationary virtual currency, of which their are a lot less in circulation, then they sure as hell can not regulate bitcoin.
