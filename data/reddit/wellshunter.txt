There is no way a corner handles that number of transactions per day.
Even if it was open 24 hours per day, this would mean that the store is handling one transaction every 25 seconds.
There is not a single major branded convenience store such as a 7 11 which handles those types of volumes, unless he is located in Times Square or some other location which has an equivalent amount of 24 hour a day foot traffic.

Yes and no. It does not mean bitcoin is being adopted by the traders as a store of value, or as an alternative to their local currency; though it does mean that it is being trusted and adopted as an alternative means of trading in the financial markets.
It is a positive as a whole for bitcoin.

I challenge you to show me one single hedge fund manager who uses it. Only small time individual traders with small amounts of money use it. People who want leverage will buy call options...they know know how to create leverage without the need to borrow money.

Correct, which galvanizes my original comment about the fact that only people without any real amount of money or experience use margin. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:19:50
You have no idea what you are talking about. I have been trading for 25 years. When somebody says they are shorting something, they are not margin trading whatsoever. You need funds in your account to short something, and usually you need much more than the value of your short position because the downside loss potential is unlimited. When somebody trades on margin it means that they are borrowing money from the broker they are working with.....margin is nothing more than a loan based on the value of your account.
The simple fact that you dont even know what margin trading is deters me from going into even further detail to explain how wrong you are as well with your comment about Hedge funds and private money managers making most of their money from options/margin trading because you are conflating two completely different things as if they were somehow related to one another which they are not.

Of course not. Pyramid schemes are destined to fail because of inherent lack of value.
The stock market has had countless bubbles over hundreds of years which always pop, yet because the stock market is based on tradable securities which have inherent value, the prices always eventually recover and reach new highs and eventually new bubbles, which pop and the whole process repeats itself over and over again as has been witnessed for hundreds of years.
This is why one of the best ways to predict future performance is in fact to look into the past, and the further into the past you look, the greater your vision of the future can actually be.

Spoken like a small time miner working out of his house.
You failed to realize that the largest miners are operating with rental costs and employee costs which need to be addressed. Imagine you are running a huge farm of machines, and you have $500,000 worth of constant expenses per month which have nothing to do with electricity. Operations like this would rather operate at an unrealized loss, warehouse the bitcoin until higher prices emerge and keep the employees working.
Do you think guys running farms can tell their landlords that they are not paying rent because of the price of bitcoin is too low? Or tell their employees they don't get paid because the price of bitcoin is not high enough?
From an accounting perspective it does not matter what the price of bitcoin happens to be when it is mined in relation to the cost of electricity. What matters is what the price of bitcoin is when they sell the bitcoin in relation to the cost of electricity and all their other expenses. Which is exactly the same as any other mining (gold silver etc) type of operation.

Bitcoin will not have a binary outcome as so many people predict. It is silly how people say "It will either be worth a million dollars, or it will be worth nothing".
This is hogwash, because the reality is that 5 years from now, bitcoin will be worth whatever it is worth. If it is sitting at $5,000 per bitcoin then there will have been zero chance that it was going to zero. Additionally, if it is sitting at zero, then there was no chance that it was going to $5,000. There is no possibility that zero as well as (insert price) are two possible outcomes.....it will only be one with zero chance of the other. 
The reality is that because nobody knows what the price will do, they claim it will go one of these two different paths. Only after time elapses will the reality unfold which shows that there was only one direction the price was destined to take.
The reality is that nobody knows until we get to that time in the future what the price will be.
The only guaranteed thing is that when five years, or ten years or how ever many years elapses, and we look at the price of bitcoin then, there will be countless people who will be breaking their arms trying pat themselves on the back stating that they knew the entire time, that the price of bitcoin was going to arrive at whatever the current price happens to be. Regardless if it is zero or a million dollars.

That question is filled with such a fundamental lack of understanding of how economics work it is almost impossible to formulate an answer.
For starters, governments use inflation as a weapon against its own citizens. It cannot be used as a tool for wealth creation unless perhaps they kept the inflation rate at a level which was below the growth rate of the population.
 
Governments capitalize on the public's ignorance about monetary policy and inflation and use money printing as a way of stealing people's wealth over time. Governments have no interest in creating wealth for their citizens, they only care about stealing the wealth from their citizens.

I disagree. You want P2P lending for margin positions? Neither P2P lending, nor playing on margin are good things, and you want the two combined? Rarely does an experienced trader of stocks ever borrow money to play in the markets, and if they do, inexperience usually gets them slaughtered before very long. The simple fact that a person needs to borrow money means they don't have much. If they don't have much, it speaks very clearly to the fact that they don't know what they are doing, because if they did know what they were doing, they would have money and wouldn't need to borrow it.

Here is why I completely disagree.
Everybody knew about the previous halving as well which happened four years ago, but the price did not increase until after it occurred. I can guarantee there were two guys like you and I 4 years ago having this exact same discussion....which one turned out to be correct? The one who said the price would increase after the fact....not the guy who said "its already priced in".
Why would you think it is any different this time?
The price moves upwards not because of people collectively deciding what the value happens to be. The price moves upwards because of an imbalance in the supply versus demand ratio.

Bitcoin still sits a a 65% discount to a price it hit 2 years ago. This is still a great price. It might go lower for a short while, but as long as you have a time horizon of a year or two, I think you will be handsomely rewarded buying here at these prices.

I feel there is risk in all forms of investing. Real estate, bonds, stocks, bitcoin, precious metals, commodities all have risk associated with them.
Of all the above mentioned asset classes, I feel that bitcoin holds the most opportunity for capital appreciation for reasons which have been referenced countless times by various members of this subReddit, so there is no need for me to ramble those reasons off again.
I am patient, and am willing to wait multiple more years if I need to, yet, I would rather see my investment move up in value like anybody would. 
We are in the world's largest recorded bond bubble right now. Interest rates have never been this low ever in history, so one day that house of cards will implode.
Real estate in most of the major cities are in bubble territory as well. The unwanted cities probably didn't see their prices rise, so they will likely be unaffected, but the major cities like LA, Miami, Seattle New York, Hong Kong, Vancouver, London, Amsterdam, etc will all get smoked like they did in 2008.
Looking at the Cape Shiller ratio it is obvious that the stock market is way overvalued. It is sitting at approximately its third most overvalued state in over 100 years. Only 1929, and 2001 had higher valuations and both of those time frames had major crashes.
Both silver and gold look fairly valued. Not overvalued or undervalued, so this doesn't look like an ideal place to be. You can look at the long term prices pegged against inflation at the Macrotrends.com website to see that this statement is true.
I am not into buying fine art, but even if I was, this is in a massive bubble by any standard.
I own 2 businesses, and I am opening a third business later in the year, and I feel that deploying capital into my businesses is a good use of my money currently.
As I mentioned earlier, bitcoin holds risks like any other investment, yet I feel from a risk versus return standpoint, bitcoin stands head and shoulders above all the investment options I have mentioned previously, which is why I have my life savings sitting in bitcoin. Bitcoin has served me well so far, and I expect that we will see bitcoin hit several thousands of dollars per bitcoin. I can only speculate on how much time is needed for this to happen, but I am patient, and will happily work on my businesses while I wait. In the meantime I live a happy life living in a small surfing community an hour north of Puerto Vallarta in a town called Sayulita where many tourists visit throughout the year because it is a slice of paradise.

@_date: 2015-12-08 20:58:51
I agree and disagree. I agree that all fiat goes to zero eventually, but I disagree with your statement about bitcoin reaching that price because of the collapse in the value of the fiat.
We need to compare the fiat against time tested assets, such as a barrel of oil, or a fine suit. For example, a fine suit historically costs approximately 1 ounce of gold. As such gold we could say a fine suit is worth about $1,100 and most of us would somewhat agree. Obviously it will not buy you a Versace suit, but it is obviously better than a Men's Warehouse suit as well.
So assuming a price of $1,000,000 per bitcoin, what we need to ask is if one day a single bitcoin will be worth 900 ounces of gold, or 900 fine suits, or a nice 2 bedroom condo in downtown Vancouver one day?

I disagree with your statement. I believe that the majority of people if they were polled would say that the halving is not priced in whatsoever. 
The run up happened in no small way because of a drop in the inflation of bitcoin. There was suddenly half as many bitcoin being created. People knew beforehand that there would be half as many created, yet the price run up occurred after the tangible effect of less bitcoin inflating the system was introduced into the system.
Same thing right now. Most of us know that there will be this effect of less bitcoin coming into the system in about 7 months from now, but you need to wait until this actually happens before you can expect the supply versus demand effect to take hold.
Granted a portion of this latest run up might be attributed to people trying to get their money into play before the next halving, but I truly believe we need to actually see the supply drop first, for the demand to be able to push the price higher......just like last time.

If you want to hold my feet to fire in your attempt to split hairs, I suppose you are correct, but lets review shall we.
Send $1,000 using the various services in our example
Paypal costs will be approximately $30
Wire Transfer fees will be approximately $45
Credit card fees charged to the receiver approximately $35
Bitcoin costs will be a couple cents.
Now lets review timeframes for that $1,000 transfer
Wire transfer will probably take a couple of days depending on domestic or international.
Credit Cards will take several days, perhaps longer depending on your merchant account provider.
Bitcoin takes a couple of seconds. Sure the confirmations in theory will take longer, but do you know of one person who has ever fallen victim from double spending? I don't, and I live in the world of bitcoin more than 99% of people who use bitcoin on a daily basis.

These three combined look massively oversold right now on a long term basis. (Both the daily and the weekly charts).
I think we are set up perfectly right now for a sustained multi month uptrend in price.
This upward reversal in price could happen within the next day week or month...it is tough to call, but I would say if you can be patient...this coiled spring is going to reverse very soon.

Thats right. It solves no problems at all except:
-It is capped at 21 million versus fiat currencies which can be printed and as a result depreciate the value of the ones in your pocket.
-It makes you your own bank instead of falling victim to capital controls like what is happening in Greece right now.
-It is decentralized, and out of the hands of corrupt politicians, thus it cannot be printed like dollars to wage wars against innocent countries against the will of its own citizens.
-It costs nothing to transfer from one person to another versus wire transfers, Paypal, Credit cards, ETFs.
-Transfers are instant rather than waiting for a third party to update their ledgers. 
-It is non-reversible protecting sellers against fraud.
But you are right......it solves no real problems.

Call it whatever you want. The point is, as each one of these countries´ banks (first Cyprus, then Greece, Spain, Portugal Italy etc) drop like flies, each account holder will be looking for places to store their value. Gold, silver and bitcoin are where they will invest their money.
Cyprus bail ins triggered a 2000% run in prices in months. Now we have multiple much larger countries lined up to follow suit.
On top of that Germany holds more credit default swaps on Greece than any other country within Deutsche Bank. When Deutsche Bank falls due to CDS it will set off a daisy chain reaction throughout all the major banks.

The 4% is temporary. It will drop down to about 1% soon. I spoke with Greg from CAVirtex about this same issue when I recently made a withdrawal.
They lost their bank account and had to scramble to get something in place to continue customer withdrawal requests. They signed up with Vogogo.
During the implementation of Vogogo they had the choice to wait until it was all set up which would cost 1% or if they were in a hurry, and could not wait for Vogogo they could manually contact Vogogo with each withdrawal request which increases the fee to 4%.
In an attempt to speed up withdrawals, they have opted to pursue the manual process until such time that the automated system is in place.
He assured me that the 4% is only a temporary cost.
Sucks for you though if you need to withdraw the whole $16K because $640 is a big hit.
Hope the info helps.

Bitcoin has fallen almost $11,000 in the last few months. Why is it so difficult for you to believe that another $2,000 or more could happen?
My guess is you hold a long position, and you cannot stand the idea of what this will mean to your portfolio's value.
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:28:16
I suppose the main reason why he would care is the value of his holdings would drop significantly in value and might not return to present value for a year or longer. 
For example, If you look at the drop from $1200 to $150 during the last crash, it took a couple years before many people were back to their breakeven point. 
I think that is very important. Add to the fact that when people see their portfolio value drop by 50%, doubt can creep into their minds about their investment choices, and this might actually lead the them selling at even lower levels.

@_date: 2018-05-11 18:12:56
OK, so you want to ignore that crash....illogical, but okay. Then I suggest you look at every other rally-high-to-crash-low since bitcoin first began trading and you will see the exact same pattern. Each and every crash, and there have been many of them, we saw BTC collapse by an average of 80%-90%.
I'm not Mr. Doom and Gloom, I am simply stating the facts. Choosing to ignore the facts is your choice, but I choose to arm myself with the facts and plan accordingly. 
We have already seen it drop from $19,000 to $8,600. Having it fall another $5,000 or $6,000 is not hard to believe at all.
My cash is sitting ready to jump back in, but it's going to be at least another year before we bottom out in my opinion, and I am guessing I'll be buying back in at $3,000...maybe even less.
Anybody who is looking at the charts, I suggest you stop looking at the 4 hour, or the 1 day, or even the weekly charts. You need to be looking at the monthly charts right now. The monthly charts paint the true picture of what is happening right now.
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:39:34
Exactly, because if the averages holds true on this crash then that means there is still another 64ish% drop coming in prices from these $8300 levels.
I luckily stopped trading back in December and went into cash and have been sitting on the sidelines ever since.
If and when the prices drop below the $3,000 level.....I am loading the boat for the next run, though I am guessing it will probably be at least a year from now for that to happen.
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:55:25
I have been part of bitcoin for years. Plus I have traded stocks successfully for over 20 years, so you go stuff yourself with posting that I have been here for a few days because it means nothing, yet I stand 100% behind my prediction.

You will see, and then you can go stuff yourself Statoshi.

This isn't surprising in my opinion. We have enjoyed an incredible rally in prices from the $!50 level to $19,000 in a few short years. Yet with prices clearly running into a strong resistance, miners are less likely to want to reinvest capital into mining equipment if they expect prices to keep falling substantially.
This period that we are in right now reminds me of a few months after the price surge up to $1,200 from the $60 level. The charts look almost identical, and if prices play out in a similar fashion this time as they did last time, then I am guessing we continue to see downward movements in price for the next year.
I know this is opposite of what is popular, and runs contrary to guys like Tom Lee, but, I think that we see prices of $3,000 before we see $30,000.
I obviously still believe in BTC in a huge way, and see it going to a million bucks per coin one day, but there is only so much growth that can occur in a certain amount of time, and I really think we have entered a consolidation phase which is going to require a lot of time for the markets to digest these prices.

Its currently only available for corporate clients in a handful of States. Most retail clients will not be offered this for some time.
@_date: 2018-05-11 07:13:41
You might be right.....or not. I have been part of BTC since it was $60 and after I watched it run to $1200, I never thought it would drop by almost 90%......but it did, and if you look at previous rally-highs-to-crash-lows, a drop of 80%-90% is the norm. 
The way I look at it is we are only going to get "X" amount of rallies out of bitcoin until it eventually hits its true all time high (perhaps that number is $100,000 or perhaps its $1,000,000).  If it ran to those prices straight away without crashes, then there would only be a 10X or 100X gain from here. Yet if we crash down to something like $3,000, and then rally to $100,000, and then crash again down to $10,000 and then rally to $1,000,000 the potential gains for traders is much much better.
So I say bring on the occasional crash just so we all have more opportunities to buy and sell this gem all the way to the top, whatever that number may be.

The way the charts are looking, and the prices have been acting, I would say "Try to be a bit more patient".
The prices are going to pop within the next few days here, and if you must exit, you should see a good opportunity within the next couple of months.
Try to hold out another 90 days, and if you must exit, then so be it. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw bitcoin sitting north of $2500 within the next 90 days.

With respect to the 2 stock footage houses that I mentioned Shutterstock and IStockphoto, both of these sites also take 70% of the value of the sales. So a sale of $100 means the creator actually only gets $30.

Your statement can be summed up by saying that creators of content would not have likely sold the content because of the lack of character of the potential end user.
This is the farthest thing from the truth. To say that James Cameron would probably not made money from somebody who downloaded his Avatar, or that Dan Brown would not have sold his Da Vinci Code to the person who downloaded it for free is inaccurate. The person who downloads content clearly shows interest. The only reason they didn't pay for it is because file sharing sites exist, not because of them not being willing to pay for the content if the file sharing sites did not exist. 
You clearly are not contributing content to this world. If you did, you would not make these statements.
You clearly cannot comprehend how file sharing sites erode the creator's income. These files swapping sites are also one of the reasons why content is as expensive as it is.
It is theft, regardless if you cannot see it for what it truly is. I say it is theft, as does the law.

@_date: 2015-05-17 17:55:34
I understand how this is an unfortunate event, yet lets be honest for a moment. There is a side of this story which is not being represented here. The side of the creator.
I derive my income from the stock footage world. For those of you who unaware of what this means, take a look at websites like  and 
I have purchased approximately $20,000 worth of camera gear. I have studied the craft of creating footage, and I dedicate my time, energy, and money to creating footage which goes for sale on sites like this so that people who wish to use the footage can pay a small fee to license the right to use that footage in any way that they wish.
They can license the footage at a cost which is a fraction of what it would cost them if they tried to recreate the exact same shots themselves. By licensing this footage they can use that footage as many times as they wish. They can use it in a commercial, they can use it on their websites, or any medium they wish.
I had to pay for the models within the footage. I had to pay for equipment. I had to pay for the editing as well as all the props associated within the footage.
By creating the footage, I own the exclusive copyright to that footage. 
If a file swapping website has my footage loaded onto it, it means that I the creator do not get paid for my efforts. It means that there are people who can simply steal what I worked so hard for.
I understand that people feel that once they have bought something, that they have the right to do whatever they wish, but it cannot come at the expense of the creator. 
If the creator was not protected, then the existing marketplace for artists disappears.
This means that if you as a person enjoy watching movies, or if you enjoy listening to music, or enjoy anything which is created through the hard work and efforts of these creators of various mediums, you need to understand that file swapping websites are extremely disruptive to our incomes.
Once again I can appreciate how people could argue in favor of this man's case because on the surface you could say that all he did was create a search engine which only searched for files. Yet the fact is that people like this man are capitalizing on the efforts of people like me. He presents society with a tool which enables us as artists to not get paid for our hard work and capital invested.
Promoting websites which circumvent artists royalties stifle the arts. 
The arts are what so many of us choose to enjoy after a hard day's work, whether it be song, or dance, or movies, or writing. File swapping websites steal from us, the creators. It is not fair to have our work stolen in this manner. I understand that people sometimes do not realize how these sites impact our lives. 
Perhaps people might ask themselves how enjoyable their lives would be without movies, books, dance and song.

Your statement is way off base. Allow me to explain since you don't know anything about content.
First of all, with respect to your question about shouldn't copyrights expire after 4 years. .......of course not. Have you given any consideration into the amount of money it costs to create a movie, or a TV show or a song? 
The creation of content does not happen for free. The movie sets, and those actors, and the equipment used on these movies costs enormous amounts of money. When a movie fails at the box office, who do you think loses out? The studio does as the creator of the film. The studio takes a calculated risk when bringing these movies into your lives. Some succeed, and some do not. The successful studios calculate the risks and allow the winning projects to compensate them for the losing ones. 
Do the studios ask the actors to give back the money if the film fails? Do the studios get to ask Panasonic back for the cost of the equipment when the Box Office numbers suck? Do the studios get the insurance back from the providers if nobody gets hurt on set? Do the studios get the money back from feeding all the staff during those work days if the footage does hit the market? 
Of course not. 
With respect to your statement about removing patents so that new markets like content delivery can be created. This is absurd. Your question is akin to saying lets not bother paying farmers for the their produce so that we can open up some stores that offer us some really good deals.
@_date: 2015-05-24 02:09:11
This is going to be a hotbed topic going forward.
Let's say you live in Los Angeles and you are Paparazzi. It is very easy for somebody to start following movie stars from one location to another and broadcasting exactly where that movie star is. 
The paparazzi could lead hundreds of people at a time to exactly where Kim Kardashian is partying. Guaranteed there are lots of people who would pay the dollar or two to the papparazi to know where their favorite celebrity is having dinner. 
I could see people setting up streaming services of traffic locations so people could see in real time what is potentially waiting for them on specific roadways, bridges, etc such as roadblocks due to accidents, or possibly police roadblocks looking for drunk drivers.
These are just a couple of uses I could see springing up from this very easily.

I transact with hundreds of thousands of dollars every month in bitcoin. The smallest transaction I usually handle is about $1,000.
Perhaps to some people a penny means something, but not in my world. 
Additionally, if this currency is going to take its place in the settlement of oil contracts, purchases of houses, stocks etc, then to these sorts of people transacting in bitcoin, I would venture to say they could care less about a 5 cent fee attached to a transaction.

The first thing you need to do is understand what money actually is.
Go to Youtube and watch Mike Maloney's video series called "The hidden secrets of money". I believe it is about 5 or 6 parts which totals about 2-3 hours of video. Watch the videos multiple times until you can actually explain how money is created as well as Mike does.
Then Google "e-gold", "Liberty Reserve", and "Liberty Dollars" and read about the creators of those currencies, and read what the US government did to them to get an understanding of how the government feels about competing currencies. This will also help you to understand why nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is.
Then Google "Executive Order 11110" and read about what Kennedy tried to implement, and notice how many days elapsed before he was shot in the head.
Then Google "Lincoln and the Greenback Dollar" and read how long it took before he was assassinated after trying to issue money without a debt payment associated with it.
Then go read "The creature from Jekkyl Island" which discusses the role the Federal Reserve has played in creating money since its inception.
When you have watched all of these videos, and read all of this information, then you will probably have a decent understanding as to why bitcoin is so important.
Finally, research what is "market capitalization" is. Then compare the market capitalization of bitcoin to stocks, currencies in circulation, and precious metals to get an understanding of why is undervalued with its current market capitalization.

Should a property owner stop receiving rent on his land after a certain amount of time? Of course not because he owns it.
The owner can transfer the rights to his children and they can reap the rewards from his efforts. 
The property owner had to put in his time and money to develop the land. Artists have to put in their time and money for their craft.
It does not matter how much money the owner of land, or the owner of the copyright has made. They continue to own their rights forever because they worked for it.
You just want something for free after it has been developed. Maybe one day you will work for something, and development something and understand, yet you clearly have nothing and feel deserving of other people's efforts.
Go build or development something and come back then and see if you feel the same way. I guarantee you will not.

I appreciate the reply. 
When one considers what these exchanges have decided to do, in the manner that they have, it begs to question "Have these exchanges sprung these policy changes so suddenly for a reason?"
The owners of the exchange must have known that prices would have been hammered as a result of the sudden policy change. They could have easily said they will implement these changes over the course of the the coming weeks, but they chose to spring the news on their clients with zero notice.
We were only 7% away from a new all time high when this news was released. It might be due to the tinfoil hat I like to wear, but I would not be surprised if the owners of the exchange are taking this opportunity to load the boat before we break above the ATH.
I say this because every time we broke through a previous all time high in the past, the price typically rallied several hundred percent in the coming months.
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:15:22
I was thinking the same thing. I believe the recent high was $247 on Bitstamp. I had a friend ask me if the time was right to buy (as if I know anything the average guy cannot see for himself), and my suggestion was to watch the $247 level which was where we sputtered out. If we can break above that resistance point, I think we might be off to the races. Fingers are crossed.

Last time I checked, interest was paid on cash....not bitcoin. For the interest to be paid on cash, this means the bitcoin has to be sold and converted to cash. This will cost you about .5-1% to sell, then when the player wants his money back, he will want it in bitcoin, which means the money has to be converted to bitcoin again, which incurs another .5-1%.
This means that it will cost the casino between 1-2% to convert bitcoin to cash and back again.
There is not one single bank on the planet right now who will pay you between 1-2% interest on your cash, and even if they did, you would have to let them hold the cash for 1 year or more.
The average player will want their cash back in way less than a year.

99% of all alt coins will go to zero. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency worth investing in.
I look at bitcoin and all the alt coins in the same way as as I looked at Ebay and all of the alt auction sites which popped up. 99% of those other auction sites folded because Ebay captured the attention and patronage of most people interested in using an online auction. Same thing with BTC vs all the alt coins.

Useless article. Bitcoin has many more massive runs in its future and probably as many crashes, ultimately resulting in prices thousands of percentage points higher than where we sit today.
If this writer (ahem) actually thinks that bitcoin is going to more upwards in an orderly fashion I am afraid he is going to be proven wrong in the very near future.
Bitcoin has a 7 billion dollar market cap which is nothing. Bitcoin is getting ready for another 1000% move this year alone in my opinion with the halving coming up later this year, and the capital controls of China happening, and let's not forget that there are multiple Cyprus 2.0 events brewing in the background ready to erupt at any time.

You could still send micro transactions, but at a cost of 5 cents.

One of the guys who predicted the subprime crisis is now saying that the Yuan could drop by as much as 50% in the coming 18 months.
There are trillions of dollars worth of Yuan sitting in Chinese banks right now. If those account holders feel like their money is about to get devalued, they will look to shield their holdings in whatever asset class they can get their hands on.
We all know that the Chinese have a major influence on the price of bitcoin as they move in and out of the currency. This could be a major upward force on btc if even 1% of those trillions of dollars seeks out protection in the form of bitcoin versus Yuan.

The price distortion that occurred around the MtGox debacle was a result of MtGox suspending wire transfer withdrawals to US citizens which meant that if a US citizen had any money on the exchange, they had to buy bitcoin to remove the funds from the exchange.
This one sided imbalance is what caused the price distortion between MtGox and the other exchanges.
Additionally, your remark about people will have to pay a hefty fee to move their bitcoin into an exchange to trade them is based on what exactly? I can load funds onto multiple exchanges for free and I bank in Canada. Others can load funds onto an exchange for free who live in the USA. I am sure others can move funds onto exchanges for free who live in other parts of the world as well.

I think you, along with others have missed the point of bitcoin. I don't think there will ever be any major enterprises, and that's completely okay.
We don't need bitcoin to replace financial remittance companies, nor credit card companies. Bitcoin doesn't need to bring tracking of fine art to the blockchain, or property registration to the blockchain.
All bitcoin needs to do to continue succeeding, is just keep doing what it is doing. Bitcoin offers people a legitimate alternative to fiat, central banks, and control. As long as we live in a world where central bankers print off currency, and impose capital controls, and fractional reserve banking, then bitcoin will flourish.

Look at your first paragraph which states:
I know that me and many others can't really afford to drop 60 or 70 bucks on the latest video game, or 10 bucks to watch a movie, or a dollar per song or whatever else. Does that mean we shouldn't have access to content and media? Maybe... But the internet is a thing,and it gives us free alternatives, so that's just how it is. You can't fight it, only adapt your business model.
Guess what? If you don't have the money to buy something then you do not deserve to own it, plain and simple.
Why on earth do you think that just because something exists that you deserve it? Just because you want something does not mean that you deserve to own it. If you can afford it, then buy it. If you cannot afford it, that is not my problem, it is your problem.

Currently, if you want to buy bitcoin, you need to actually spend some time researching about wallets, and worry about passwords and security. Its no big deal, but its a bit of a hurdle for the average "mom and pop investor".
Now comes along an ETF, which automatically gives bitcoin the "stamp of approval" of the SEC. Now "mom and pop investor" no longer need to learn about or worry about things like wallets and security. They can simply log into their online brokerage account at any brokerage firm (Etrade, Charles Schwabb, etc) and buy bitcoin using the same old UI that they are used to seeing with their broker's website.
Simultaneously, once the ETF has earned the SEC approval, now institutional capital (think bank's mutual funds) can now purchase bitcoin. Without SEC approval, bitcoin only receives a very small fraction of institutional capital because many of their mandates insists that they only invest within SEC approved instruments.
As far as how this might affect price.......I think you can imagine as well as anybody how this would affect the price.

Just because the price had already tripled is not proof that Cyprus had nothing to do with the price action. There were wise investors who saw Cyprus coming, just like there are wise investors today who sense the same sort of bail ins will occur in other nations.
I understand your argument, but your statement of Cyprus being a "myth" is only your opinion, and not fact.
I would also argue that one of the things that caused the run up during the Cyprus event was the previous halving had occurred prior to Cyprus and the tangible effects of less supply were taking hold in the marketplace.
Ultimately neither you, nor I, "know" anything. All either of us can do is speculate about what had happened, and what will happen. :)

I think Antpool is one of the straws that tipped the trend from buying to selling, yet let's not fool ourselves into thinking that it is the only reason for the sell off.
Let us not forget the SEC denied the ETF at this time, combined with the fact that the price had just finished rallying for 3 months leading up to this point.
I would say that each of these elements played their respective role collectively which resulted in the sell off.

Dont forget a few other of the largest costs associated with banks.
1)Banks are directly responsible for creating approximately 94% of the money supply through fractional reserve banking. This additional money supply contributes greatly to the inflation rates, and by extension the loss of purchasing power. Bitcoin does the exact opposite thing.
2)Bailouts of the banks by the taxpayers. Remember how much that last bailout cost the taxpayers after the 2008 incident? Bitcoin never requires a bailout.
3)War. 99% of the wars, are bankers wars. Bitcoin promotes fairness, equality and peace as compared to the war machine.
To quote Smedley Butler.....there are only two times that the USA should go to war. 1)To protect our homes. 2)To protect the Bill of Rights.
The last time the USA truly needed to protect either of these was Dec 7, 1941 when Pearl Harbor was attacked. Every war since then has been a banker bred war designed to fill the pockets of the bankers at the expense of world peace.

With all due respect my friend, you can ask anybody on this board and they will tell you it is not pegged to the dollar.

You need to remember that there is $30 trillion dollars sitting in Chinese accounts. If $1 billion comes into bitcoin as a result of Chinese investors, this equates to .00003% of the total amount of available money that the Chinese have to invest.
I think you would be better served asking yourself, what is going to happen to the price if and when just one tenth of 1% of that money makes its way into bitcoin versus trying to find potential fraud or pump and dump schemes which simply are not happening.

For starters I dont agree with your question. You have implied that I need to think $800 or $900 to be more realistic.
I have been holding for years, and during those years I have seen bitcoin make multiple 1000% moves, so I find your assumption that a 10 to 20% move as being unrealistic considering the timeframe I am willing to continue to hold my bitcoin for.
Though your profile is a whopping 2 days old, so I don't expect you to be as committed as most of us since you are clearly a newbie.
For the record though........I believe bitcoin goes to several thousand dollars before this current rally has concluded, and I would not be surprised if that happens within the next 90 days.

It is unrealistic to think that specific returns can be compounded at a high rate for very long because the highest returns in the shortest amounts of time are usually achieved in smaller market cap stocks which are beginning a turnaround after a prolonged multi year sell off.
As such it is much easier for a small portfolio to achieve 100% annual returns than it is for a large portfolio because there simply is not as much available equities available for purchase once you have millions to invest as compared to thousands to invest.
This is why you can frequently see a small investor get triple digit returns in a year, while a large fund with professional advisors will rarely achieve more than whatever the DOW or Nasdaq achieved as a whole for the year.
With that being said, this does sound like an interesting idea which might hold promise while the fund's capital base is remains small (under a few million dollars).

When you say "that run up" I have no idea which run you are talking about. You need to remember that there were several run ups of more than 1000% since 2009 when bitcoin began trading at MtGox.
Indeed the MtGox issue contributed to one of the run ups as people were forced to buy bitcoin to get there money off of the exchange, yet all the other run ups were attributed to organic buying.
If all the run ups were attributable to MtGox versus people's genuine interest in owning bitcoin then the prices would have crashed after MtGox imploded and would have never recovered.
There wouldnt be a 9 billion market cap like what we are witnessing today. Bitcoin would have imploded at gone to zero.

Rent as a direct result of the increasing cost of real estate has gone up as well. It has not gone up as much as real estate, (somebody can feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but I think it has increased 8% this last year. 
As you can imagine, when rents go up, so does everything else. The shopkeepers need to offset their increased rent by passing on higher prices in everything that they sell, regardless if it is a pint of beer, or a fur coat.
Luckily, the Canadian dollar has bounced a bit in recent months against the US dollar. Currently the US dollar buys about $1.28 Canadian. Less than a year ago, it was closer to $1.35.
I believe this is at least partly attributable to the bounce in the price of oil. The Canadian dollar moves up and down quite a bit based on the price of oil, so with oil back up over $50 a barrel, we have seen a bit of strength in our currency these last few months.

I would not be so confident in your declaration that there is no way that bitcoin can run 1000% in a very short amount of time.
Look at this chart
You can see that it ran over 1000% from Jan 2013 to May 2013. It then ran over 1000% again Oct 2013 to December 2013.
It also ran over 1000% other times as well prior to this. In total, I believe that bitcoin has exhibited 1000% moves in short amounts of time on at least 4 different occasions within the last 7 years. 
To me, it is not only possible, but probable that we are about to witness the next 1000% move, especially with the next halving only 5 weeks away.

There are countless bitcoin gambling sites out there already, and many of them make next to nothing.
You can make it if you just want to run it or your own personal interest, but it is highly unlikely that it will ever make money.
Even if it did start to make any money, unless you are registered in a jurisdiction like Costa Rica, you will get shut down for running an illegal website.
Also, even if you registered in Costa Rica and were a US citizen, the US government will still try to arrest you.
It just is not worth the risk when you consider the rewards are almost non existent.

Actually term life insurance is a scam, and as such I would never compare bitcoin to term life insurance. Basically with term life, you are betting that you die before the term on your policy.
Whole life insurance is way better than term life insurance. Whole life guarantees a payout to the beneficiary regardless how long the policy holder lives.
As such....if you want to compare bitcoin to an insurance policy...its whole life insurance.....not term life.
And to those out there who bought term life insurance.........wake up....you are being scammed....go buy the whole life insurance instead, because how would you like to make payments on a policy for twenty years only to have it elapse worthless leaving you zero coverage for you and your loved ones.

Your logic is flawed. The bubble was years ago when it ran several thousand percent up to $1200. That was the bubble which results in the price falling over 80% to the $150 level.
This is not a bubble....this is the next leg up. The next bubble price will be when the price is several times higher than the previous bubble high of $1200.
Today's price of $563 is going to look like a steal six months from now when the price is sitting at $5,000

I am constantly baffled at the repeated criticism about Blockchain.info having an insecure wallet.
These comments are unfounded and false and should be eliminated.
Blockchain.info may not have run their business as well as people on the sidelines like to project, yet the reality is that Blockchain.info has more users than any other wallet on the planet, and the majority of issues that have been reported with Blockchain.info is a result of user inexperience as compared to any fault of the Blockchain.info wallet.

IMHO.....sometime within the next couple of days we are going to watch the prices begin to roll over, and I feel that we are about to begin a multi month sell off.
I have been part of bitcoin for years and have watched it do exactly this multiple times. The conditions today are identical to the conditions in the past when it happened.
The conditions being....
1)The prices have moved up over 1000% in a relatively short amount of time.
2)Everybody everywhere seems bullish as all get go about bitcoin and all the cryptos.
I am massively bullish about bitcoin......but, I feel that in the near term we are going to see the inevitable reversal which always happens in every bull market. It's not a bad thing....it's just what markets do.....they hit "tops", and I feel that we are at one right now.

It will accelerate after we breach the all time high because that is just how it works.
Take the time and track back every all time high that bitcoin has ever hit. If you notice, in every incident that the all time high had eventually been breached to the upside (after selling off for months beforehand) that this is exactly where new money comes in, and we race upwards to the next bubble high.
Since it has happened in every incident (plus I watch this same pattern in stocks every day), I expect that this time will follow suit and repeat the same pattern.
@_date: 2016-06-25 22:52:48
Its called the network effect. Imagine when the first 2 people had telephones. At that time the network seemed worthless because only 2 people had a phone. Yet, as more people come online to use the service, the network becomes more valuable to the people using it, which in turn draws in even more people, and this just repeats and grows.
I am too young to remember what the first phone networks were like, but I am old enough to remember being one of the first Paypal users. I remember people asking me why I would ever use a service like Paypal when there were next to no other users using it at that time. I saw the service as being extremely useful and saw the potential, and now there are probably a couple hundred million Paypal users globally. It is so common today that I scoff at any business which fails to offer it.
Bitcoin will follow a similar path as Paypal, as well as the telephone because it offers the end user the ability to do something in a way that no other service does. This service will enrich the life of the end user, and as we can see from the total number of transactions, this service is being adopted at a breakneck speed.

The bottom will be closer to $1,000 than $5,000. I went into cash in December fully expecting this to happen. I am looking forward to getting back in, but I don't think we bottom out for many more months.
If you examine what happened during the last crash when we fell from $1,200 to $150 the weekly RSI fell into the low 20's on a weekly basis, so I am holding out until I see that happen again. 
The weekly RSI is still in the 40's so.....take that for what its worth.

You are right, and in my opinion, we go below $2,000. I have been in cash since December anticipating this was going to happen.
Rather than trying to pick the bottom in price, I am going to try to pick the bottom on the RSI on a weekly basis. The last time we sold off from $1200 to $150 the weekly RSI got into the low 20's.
Current weekly RSI is still in the 40's so we could easily fall for another 6 months.

There is nothing wrong with not knowing how to speak a second language. I am learning Spanish right now. Yet I would never attempt to argue a native speaker if my ability to communicate was not perfect.

Occupy Wallstreet was defeated because there was no defined goal. There were no specific plans or ideas laid out. 
Without a defined purpose the movement simply fell apart due to lack of leadership or objective.
It did not fall apart because of specific personalities injected into the masses. If so, who are you talking about? You can't name one because that theory is garbage.
If they had specific goals laid out, they could of had a gameplan as to what success looked like once it was achieved.
For example, the goals could have been:
1)Ending fractional reserve banking.
2)Ending a debt based monetary system.
3)Bringing about campaign finance reform.
The Occupy movement got the world's attention, and clearly it was due to society feeling like they needed change, yet the movement failed to articulate why it was there, or what they wanted to see as far as change. Most people there knew their system was corrupt, yet they didn't possess they ability to articulate the changes that needed to occur. The Occupy movement collapsed under its own lack of leadership and lack of defined objectives.

This article is nice to read on first blush, but it is an exaggeration.
Lets go along with what the writer has to say about the transaction value of bitcoin going from $20 billion to $150 billion in a few years as a result of adoption.
Once the bitcoin has been sent into the casino, it has to do one of two things.
1)The bitcoin is sold on an exchange which creates a dampening effect equal to the purchase effect.
2)Another seller wishes to cash out with bitcoin, which will probably end of being converted into currency by way of selling on an exchange.
Sure there can be an argument that the casino operator might keeps his profits in bitcoin, or that gamblers might do the same thing, which obviously would mean that the price of bitcoin would have to rise. Yet, the way the article is written in makes it sound like as soon as the bitcoin has entered the gambling arena, that it is never converted back to fiat. Nice in theory, yet this simply would not happen.

Sure...it could happen.
Yet when stocks, commodities, etc such as bitcoin are off 80% from their highs...this is when smart money usually steps in.
Remember....buy when the price is low....sell when the price is high.
Just like when it ran from $60 to $1200, you need to remember that it was down 75% from its previous high of $250ish. People had watched it fall from $250 to $60 and said bitcoin was dead. Just like when it fell from its all time high of $20 down to $3. People said it was dead. They were wrong then, and in all probability, they are wrong again now.
I tend to look at things longer term than most. Probably because I have been playing the stock market for 30 years before bitcoin was ever invented, so I have a bit of history with market prices.

Because it ran 2000% from $60 to $1200.
After it ran 2000%, the price fell victim to profit taking, which then turned into negative sentiment.
The cure for low prices, is low prices. Eventually the inverse will happen and one day people will be asking "why are we up 800% from the $200 level?"
Its just what markets do.

Good speech.
The overpowering feeling that I come away with after watching this video is echoed repeatedly within society today. It happens in the comments section of Youtube videos, it happens in the comments sections of blog posts, it happens on Facebook pages, it happens in the form of callers who call into call into TV programs and radio shows. It might even happen after I write this comment myself.
For some reason, a large portion of our society would rather point out a small mistake made within the context of a speech, rather than acknowledge somebody for their mostly correct contribution to a topic.
This economist has taken his time to stand up in front of an audience and give what was a rather well informed speech. The very first person in the audience who was permitted to start the round of questions and comments was eager to point out exactly how wrong the economist was.

I would have to disagree.
Just because a country deems something as being illegal in their home country does not mean that residents of another country need to obey the laws of other countries.
For example: Sharia law nations such as Saudi Arabia have a law which prohibits anybody from drawing a picture of the Prophet Muhammad.
If somebody in Canada wants to hire an artist to draw a picture of the Prophet Muhammad, he does not need to ask the artist if he is a resident of a Sharia law nation.

I would not approach it this way, because what you are saying by not giving the money first is that the person has to send you the bitcoin first.
If I was selling you my bitcoin, I wouldn't send you any until I had the cash in my hand.
Additionally if I had already sent you the bitcoin, there is no way I would be waiting 10 minutes for a confirmation before collecting the cash. 
The cash can always be taken back from the person...the bitcoin cannot. If you are dealing with lots of money and are concerned, bring a friend with you who can back you up in case things go bad. Hand the seller the cash first on the condition that they hand you their driver's license or car keys.

I respectfully disagree. France is very close to seeing shit happening.

Today the Debt to GDP is 95%
France has a higher Debt to GDP than Spain right now.
Anytime a country's Debt to GDP starts getting towards 100%, this is exactly when the warning bells should be alarmed.
Greece sits at about 175%.
USA sits at 103%

Do you realize that right now the stock market is at it 3rd most overvalued point in history?
The only times where it was more overvalued on a CAPE ratio was right before the crash of 1929, and right before the Dot Com crash.
The current CAPE ratio is sitting at 25. You want to buy into stocks when the CAPE ratio is under 10.

I do not own gold, but I could not disagree with you more.
The majority of people who own major amounts of gold are not dumb. 
Additionally, the majority of gold holders do not hold their gold in banks. They hold their gold in repositories such as Brinks Vaults.
Additionally, the majority of the best repositories offer segregated bullion storage which means that each person's bullion is in their own segregated spot and not mixed with other people's bullion.
Additionally each of these repositories are audited several times a year by reputable auditing firms to ensure that the accounting of each person's bullion is accurate.
Additionally, each of these repositories have insurance policies to protect the clients against theft.
Additionally, if you store through a company such as TDS Vaults who store their gold inside of Brinks vaults actually have their own insurance policy on top of the insurance policy that Brinks holds.

Bitcoin is great for many more reasons than the 1 reason you just listed.
With respect to whether or not I am against governments paying bank bailouts or not.......for starters, the only way the government has any money whatsoever is because they have taken it from their citizens. Thus I am against the government stealing citizens money and handing it out to banks.
The banks are some of the, if not the largest contributors to political campaign finance. Thus when politicians come into power they are already in the pockets of the corrupt bankers and as a result politicians sell their own citizen's down the river to honor the corrupt relationship they have propagated with these criminal bankers whenever these scumbag bankers over-leverage their trading activities with the depositor´s money and need to be saved.

That is not at all what I am saying. 
I am just pointing out that the fall in price of bitcoin has not been quite as bad as one might initially think.
For example, if the US dollar index had not moved from one year ago until today, then the fall in price of bitcoin from the $500 level to the $257 level would actually represent a drop in purchasing power of about 48.6%. Yet, since they value of the US dollar has increased so dramatically in the last year, the value of bitcoin has really only dropped in value by about 38.2%.

It is not an arbitrary number whatsoever. It was the bailout amount from 2008. This is only a small percentage of what has been printed off within the last 7 years. Thus not only is this number not arbitrary, it actually does not reflect how how much money is sitting in dollars which could migrate into bitcoin from just one single country as people wise up to the counterfeiting activities of the Federal Reserve and other central bankers around the world.
Of course there are other stores of value such as gold and silver which have been real money for 5,000 years where people can sell their fiat into to escape inflationary pressures, yet bitcoin has risen 500,000% in 6 years, so I would argue that mankind will continue on this same path of liquidating dollars and migrating into bitcoin, and as such, if only $700 billion came into bitcoin, it would bring bitcoin´s value close to the $49,000 mark.
With respect to the network only handling a transaction rate of today´s measurement, this will obviously improve over time as need be.

I disagree.
It has increased by 500,000% from when it was valued at 5 cents. During that time it never really loses more than 75% after each run up, so I would argue that it IS growing rapidly, while maintaining stability.
Many stocks lose 75% of value after only running up a few hundred percent, and they are considered relatively stable in relation to market activity.
What we are witnessing has never been seen in history. A brand new currency, completely agnostic to any government being massively adopted in a short amount of time.

@_date: 2015-08-12 03:49:26
You are looking at it wrong.
Currently there are 1.37 Trillion US dollars in circulation. (This does not include stocks, bonds, or any other asset valued in US Dollars....just the actual paper circulating in the form of actual dollar bills in various denominations).
This means that there is a US dollar market capitalization of $ 1.37 Trillion dollars.
Now if you look at bitcoin. There are 21 million of these that will be created eventually. For argument's sake, let's look at the market capitalization of bitcoin assuming all 21 million were already in circulation.
If you multiple the $270 by the total number of bitcoin outstanding, you can determine that the current market capitalization of bitcoin sits at $5.6 Billion dollars.
This would mean that for Bitcoin to have the same market capitalization as the US dollar if would need to go up to a value of $65,238 per bitcoin.
So to answer your question about bitcoin needing to come down to a 1-1 valuation with the US dollar is incorrect. For it to have a 1-1 valuation with the US dollar, it will need to rise in price to $65,238 per bitcoin.
(Side note- This same formula is used to determine the market capitalization of stocks. For example, Google has a market capitalization of $453 Billion. They have a price of $660 per share. By dividing the price of the stock into the market capitalization you can determine total shares outstanding. I have explained this formula so many times to friends and family and rarely do they ever really get it. I get calls all the time from people who say "Hey look at this stock.......it's cheap...its only 10 cents per share" The price per share is NOT how you determine how expensive something is....it is the market capitalization.
A $500 stock is cheaper than a 10 cent stock if there are a trillion shares outstanding on the 10 cents stock, while there are only 1000 shares outstanding on the $500 stock.)

I acquire some bitcoin every single month, and have been doing so for 2 years.
My wallet just keeps growing every month, and I have never sold any.
All it will take is 100,000 other people across the entire planet to do exactly what I am doing and there would not be one single bitcoin available.

They need to reword their website. It says Canadian dollars will be converted to US dollars.
It should read US dollars will be converted to Canadian dollars since it is being deposited in a Canadian account.
Additionally, I would like to know what they are using as a rate for currency conversion.
If they offer XE.com rates they might be able to penetrate, but if they think they can charge a currency conversion fee from US to Canadian, than I am sure Canadians would rather deal with either QuadrygaCX or with CAVirtex and not suffer the high fees.
Additionally, CAVirtex charges about $8 to withdraw funds to your bank account while Bitstamp wants 1%. That is too high of a fee for a withdrawal unless you are withdrawing under $1,000.
I doubt they penetrate into Canada in any meaningful way with rates that high.

I understand your point, and I agree that bitcoin has a bright future, yet I think you are missing what Martin Armstrong is saying within the first quote.
Let me summarize his position in a simpler language. 
If you try to take away a government's ability to simply print currency at will, the government will do anything it can to try to stop this from happening.
Bitcoin is exactly this kind of threat. Martin realizes that every government will view bitcoin in the same manner. Bitcoin threatens every government's ability to simply print off dollars, euros, yen, renminbi, pounds.
There are so many backdoor deals that the average Joe on the street never is aware of. The types of deals that involve a combination of the military industrial complex, the major banks, and corrupt politicians. 
The corrupt politicians engage in political maneuvering which drags countries into wars. These same politicians send the defence contracts to the military industrial complex, and the banks are always there the help with the financing of major ramp ups of production during war time.
These three working hand in hand are profiting to levels which are beyond comprehension.
If bitcoin takes away a government's ability to simply print off dollars and make politicians act in a financially responsible manner, it would mean the end of 90% of the wars, and in the process it represents the end of the gravy train for these three corrupt areas.
Martin realizes that governments will try to fight any serious threat to the current status quo.

Zero Hedge is a financial blog that aggregates news and presents editorial opinions from original and outside sources. The news portion of the site is written by a group of editors who collectively write under the pseudonym "Tyler Durden", a character from the novel and film Fight Club.

Zero Hedge was founded in January 2009.[2] Posts are signed "Tyler Durden," a character in the Chuck Palahniuk book and movie Fight Club,[3] reflecting the news site's activist posture.[2]
Despite speculation that "Tyler Durden" is a pseudonym of Daniel Ivandjiiski,[3][4] who was penalized for insider trading in New York in September 2008, Ivandjiiski denies being a founder of Zero Hedge. Rather, he says he is one of several writers contributing to the site under the pseudonym.[5] In a 2009 interview, one editor claimed that there are four editors in total at Zero Hedge[2] but another editor said there were up to 40.[3]
In 2010, Morgan Stanley threatened to pursue legal action against the website for its alleged plagiarism of Morgan Stanley research.[6]
Some of the editors have professional experience in finance and business operations roles.[2] It reports on economics, Wall Street, and the financial sector and is credited with bringing the controversial practice of flash trading to public attention in 2009 via a series of posts alleging that Goldman Sachs' access to flash order information allowed it to gain unfair profits.
Zero Hedge publishes anonymously to protect the editors from retaliation for dissident speech.[citation needed] The editors maintain that this also safeguards integrity, objectivity, and independence. One editor cited McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, which upheld anonymity as a First Amendment right of free speech.[2]
The site was described by CNNMoney as offering a "deeply conspiratorial, anti-establishment and pessimistic view of the world."[7] Other writers have characterized the site as conspiratorial.[8][9] A Forbes article described the site as a source of hysteria and occasionally misleading information.[10]
In September 2009, Zero Hedge had begun drawn more traffic than certain financial websites[5] with 333,000 unique visitors a month.[4] Durden says two-thirds of its readers are from Wall Street.[2] According to Quantcast, in 2012 Zero Hedge had a monthly global traffic of 1.8 million people.[11] Under the name Tyler Durden, Ivandjiiski was interviewed on Bloomberg Radio[3][12] and Zero Hedge has been quoted in the Columbia Journalism Review.[13]
In December 2012, Bank of America blocked its employees' access to Zero Hedge.[14]
Matt Taibbi cites Zero Hedge as having accurately assessed the level of corruption in the banking industry. He questions why mainstream financial media did not earlier detect the corruption at Goldman Sachs.[15]

Impossible to say. It depends on the owner.
The owner of Overstock keeps a portion of his because he believes in bitcoin's potential.
The good thing for the owner of Backpage is because bitcoin is decentralized, there is nobody reporting to the government for tax purposes, versus Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.
Additionally, none of the hookers are going to be claiming the advertising expense on their yearly tax returns.
The owner could conceivably decide to simply hoard the bitcoin other than what is required to cover costs which are minimal.

If the escorts began to offer bitcoin as a payment option, which I am sure some of them will once they become familiar with it, this would probably be a welcome option for the "Johns" due to the perceived anonymity of it.

I am talking about a bank which will pay on US dollars. The Australian dollar for example has lost 30% of its value against the US dollar in the last 5 years.
So even though it may appear that the Aussie banks are giving you a better rate, it most certainly is not the case if you have had to convert US dollars to Aussie dollars to get the higher rate..
This is why you read so much nowadays about the "carry trades" which are blowing up around the world. People would borrow at next to 0 interest rates in US dollars and then take those dollars and invest them in foreign currency markets earning deposit rates higher than the rates being charged by the US lending institution. But now that the US dollar has increased so significantly against these other foreign currencies, and the loans have to be paid back in US dollars; all of these so called smart "carry trades" are blowing up left right and center.

I am aware that this is the login link. This is the link which I have used for three years.
I am stating that something has changed sometime within the last three weeks. Now when I click my login link which looks identical to what you posted above (with the exception that my link appears at the end of the link), I am not taken to a screen where I simply enter my password like I have done so for three years. Now I am taken to a screen which has this URL  
It now makes me click a link to where it says "Existing Users", which then prompts me to enter my wallet ID and password.
I have logged into this wallet literally thousands of times over the  last three years, and this is the very first tie this is being asked of me. Something has obviously changed.
Can somebody from Blockchain.info confirm this is not some sort of scam? I doubt somebody has set up some sort of scam because even when I click the link which appears in my original sign up email from three years ago I am taken to this same page, but considering how many bitcoin I have in my wallet I want to be extremely careful.

It will take a long time before a country adopts bitcoin as an official currency.

The reason is simple. The ROI for an ad would never generate enough to warrant the costs. Just because some random show has bitcoin mentioned in the story does not mean that anybody watching the show wants to buy bitcoin.
Advertisers frequently cannot justify running ads on tv when 50% of the viewers plan on using a product similar to what they are selling, so when you consider that less than 1% of viewers might have an interest in buying bitcoin, it becomes pretty obvious that any tv based ad campaign would be a horrible waste of money.
Advertisers would get a much better ROI for their ad dollars if they ran ads on Google, or Facebook, or some sort of bitcoin focused website.

If you have the ability to do so, pull up the charts for bitcoin and examine each of the previous bull runs. There have been approximately 8 so far where bitcoin ran several hundred percent like what we have witnessed over the course of the last 2 years. At the end of each of the previous bull runs, when bitcoin finally rolled over, it fell by 60% or more every time. I expect that this will be no different. I sold my bitcoin already with the intention of buying back in below $2,000.

It is well known that rallies can end because there is simply nobody left to buy into the rally. Everybody has already committed themselves financially and at that point, when the smallest amount of people wish to exit, there is nobody left to sell to, and the price needs to come down a little lower to find a buyer, and then this pattern just repeats itself, and grows larger, and then eventually the crowd wakes up to what is happening, which triggers more selling and so on. This is trading 101 kinda stuff. Not opinion, but fact. 
In my opinion, we have reached that point. The rally has run for 2 years, and we moved up from $200 to $5,000. We eventually need to come to a break for some time. Its not a bad thing, its just the mechanics of a market.
I have been in bitcoin since it was $60. I rode the wave to $1200, and rode the wave down from there to $150, and then road the wave up until just recently where I sold. 
These waves are normal, and its simply time for us to go down for a while...that's all. Bitcoin still rocks....but it is about to go down in price in my humble opinion.

Additionally, I said at least 60% in every case. Sometimes the drops amounted to a drop of 90%.

The bond yield curve which is the spread between 2 year and 10 year notes is extremely close to inverting. 
There is no greater predictor of bad times ahead than an inverted yield curve.
At the current pace, the yield curve will be inverted before the end of the year. The last time this occurred was months before the 2008 stock market crash.
Anybody who wants to see where that yield curve is can visit this link. (Once it drops below zero....that's when it inverts).

The banks cannot naked short bitcoin like they do with paper contracts in the gold market; or collude to rig interest rates.
You would need to own the bitcoin to be able to sell it, so the answer to your question is "of course not".

The largest globally held assets on the planet are stocks, and bonds and real estate. The prices of these three asset classes in the last 10 years have skyrocketed.
Before you say anything..I am not talking about crappy little towns like Flint Michigan or Detroit, but cities where people want to live on a global basis such as Vancouver, London, New York, Hong Kong have risen dramatically in the last ten years.
The prices of day to day items like bread and milk etc have not risen, but the major asset classes where people invest their money have dramatically risen with the increase of the money supply.

Ripple is designed for banks. They have always been targeting the banks as clients, and to do so they need to implement this feature.

(For every dollar that I own in Ripple, I own a hundred it bitcoin.)
Ripple has never been a competitor to bitcoin. They serve completely different markets in their functionality.

If the day ever comes whereby they get enough banks signed onto their platform, it will assist in speeding up the transfer of money within the legacy banking system while simultaneously reducing costs for customers.

No. Wrong again. Originally my comment never used the word "inflation". It was you...not me, who brought that word into this discussion.
Originally I was replying to a person who wanted to know how the price of gold could have only been $300 a decade ago.
I referenced the cost of a suit in relation to gold over the course of hundreds of years, and it was you who has chosen to engage in this never-ending attempt at proving me wrong.

No it doesn't. People who launder money are usually attempted to "clean" their money, hence the term "launder". That is not happening here. All that is happening here is people are buying a small bit of inexpensive art with their bitcoin.
For this to be laundered funds, they would then need to turn around and sell the art for "clean money" which obviously is not what is happening here.

No you cannot. The only way a bank could have fractional reserve lending with bitcoin, is if they are lending out fiat, while holding the bitcoin as their reserve.
As an example:
Current fractional reserve banking allows a deposit of $100 fiat to facilitate $900 worth of fiat loans. The bank can lend 9 times what it holds in reserves. 
With bitcoin, if somebody deposits 100 bitcoin, the bank cannot lend out any more than that 100 bitcoin. The bank cannot just simply hold 10% reserves in bitcoin like they do with cash. 
The majority of fiat in our system is created by banks. Banks cannot simply create more bitcoin.
Thus, banks cannot have fractional reserve banking with bitcoin. The only thing banks could do is hold bitcoin as the reserve, and lend out fiat.

Not necessarily.
There are multiple types blockchains.
Public Blockchains like what bitcoin is.
Private Blockchains.
Semi private Blockchains.
For a closed loop situation like internal bookkeeping for a bank, they have no need to use outside miners to verify transactions within their banking infrastructure.
They could very easily see greater value in going with a private blockchain they they create and control. It is only being used by them, and potentially their own clients, so something like bitcoin is unnecessary for their situation.

If you want to be taken seriously, you will need a proven successful track record to separate yourself from the flock.
If you think people will pay you to give them bitcoin related advice, you are going to need to prove to them that you have run some sort of bitcoin business which they can verify for themselves.
I would never pay a bitcoin consultant a penny unless they can say something along the lines of........."My name is Tony Gallippi and I started Bitpay" or "My name is Andreas Antonopoulos and I am a professional coder" or something like that.
You will need proof that your time is worth their money. 
Nobody is going to pay anybody a fee for helping them open a wallet, or directing them towards a specific exchange to buy bitcoin, or directing them towards a service like Bitpay as a way to accept bitcoin for their business.
If you truly have knowledge in a non-pedestrian manner, then please let us know what it is you bring to the table.
What exactly do you think you can offer a person who is interested in bitcoin which they cannot read for themselves in the same way that you educated yourself?
If the only thing you offer, is the knowledge that you have from scouring Reddit and Bitcointalk then I am afraid you are wasting your time and you should look elsewhere. Yet if you can assist people in an aspect of the market which they cannot achieve through simple reading then "yes" there will always be opportunities for people who actually bring something tangible to the table.

No, that is not what I am telling you.
What I am telling you with a straight face is:
If you look at the guy´s website you will see his proprietary chart that displays when gold is overvalued or undervalued based on his modeling.
He abandons the usual measures of just looking at M1, M2 or M3 because these money flow indicators are not reliable enough.
The gold model shows the average annual fair value for gold in US dollars. The model is not intended to be predictive and does not incorporate future expectations. It is based solely on historical money supply (US dollars) and gold supply data. Nor does the model take into account short term volatility, like those caused by exchange rate fluctuations, for example.
It is important to realize then, that the model is not a tool to predict daily gold prices. It is a method of estimating the average annual value of gold relative to US dollars on a long-term basis which, when compared to the current market price of gold, tells us whether gold is undervalued or overvalued.

Typically the price difference has nothing to do with manufacturing standards whatsoever.
The generic has the exact same ingredients as the brand name version, yet the brand name version typical holds patent rights for 20 years. After 20 years expire, anybody can replicate the formula and offer a generic version. Generics are always cheaper because the creator of the generic did not have to go through the R&amp;D process and incur the same expenses as the patent holder.
Generic versions are just not allowed to use the same name as the brand who holds the current patent when the patent actually expires.
For example Viagra still holds their patent until the year 2017 which is why those little boner pills still costs so much, yet in a 2 year timeframe when the patent expires you are going to see a flood of generic versions of those little blue pills hit the marketplace.
The generic version will not be called the same thing, yet the ingredients, manufacturing process and end results will be the same as Viagra. (If you still maintain an erection after 4 hours consult your physician immediately).

Google and Apple dominate their respective industries today, but their stock prices do not accurately reflect the growth of each industry because neither was there at the inception of their respective industries. Bitcoin is here at the beginning of its industry.

I disagree with a key part of his argument. He eludes to the the halving effect will have no real affect on the overall selling pressure.
I would be willing to bet that the majority of the new bitcoin mined gets sold almost immediately to cover the overhead expenses and living expenses of the miners.
If all of a sudden there are half as many of those new bitcoin being sold into the market, this will have a dramatic affect on the price.
Let's say there are 25 newly created bitcoin within each block. Simultaneously there was a equal distribution of buyers and sellers within the markets. If the same proportion of buyers and sellers remain constant, yet you now only offer 12.5 newly bitcoin within each new block, this absolutely will ramp the price up.

Bitcoin does prevent it. You just can get your head around it.
There are only 21 million bitcoin. The banks cannot create any more.
Obviously a bank could attempt to run a fractional reserve system with bitcoin, yet since the banks cannot create more bitcoin like they can with fiat, a fractional reserve system would collapse much sooner with bitcoin than it will with fiat.
It would be an epic failure within a extremely short amount of time.
Thus a fractional reserve system will never work with bitcoin.
The inflationary reality of our fiat system is what propagates the fractional reserve system. You have a Federal Reserve which is capable of printing more and more fiat when the system needs it. you do NOT have a Federal Reserve who can print more bitcoin.

Nonsense to you for not thinking before writing.
Stocks are a completely different story than bitcoin.
Stocks are a subset of the economy. To compare bitcoin to a stock accurately you would need to find one stock that measured an encapsulated industry which did not have competitors.
For example, if you felt that the automobile was an invention which was destined to grow when it was first created, there was no single stock to buy. You could perhaps buy Ford, or GM eventually, yet there was not any one single unit of measure which was tied directly into the invention.
The same thing when the TV was invented. If you felt that it was destined to change the world, the best you could do was perhaps buy RCA, but even that did not measure its growth properly because of competitors who would eventually come to market.
Now if you could somehow find some investment vehicle which offered somebody to profit on the expansion of the car market, or TV market which was not tied to any one specific centralized company, that would be a much closer comparison to what bitcoin represents.
Just like when the internet was first invented. There was no one single investment opportunity which allowed investors to bet on the entire Internet. 
Bitcoin is different because you are betting on the entire growth of this disruptive Earth changing opportunity with this one single unit...the bitcoin.
So as compared to looking at stock charts which do not measure the growth of an industry, rather the growth of one single centralized company within that industry, the price of bitcoin is an actual measure of the entire industry in itself.

Let me simplify this for you.
Let's say the bank only has 2 customers.
Customer A deposits 100 bitcoin.
Customer B wants to a loan for 90 bitcoin.
Bank initiates the loan for 90 bitcoin which leaves the bank with a total of 10 bitcoin.
Customer A returns, and says "I want my 100 bitcoin".
How does the bank pay back 100 bitcoin to the rightful owner when they only have 10 bitcoin?

Sorry but you are incorrect.
Do more research on the guy. His research has taken everything into consideration which is of merit. I don't have time to dig up the other info...but it is out there if you truly want to learn more about the guy.
He was correct calling gold a buy years ago when it was $300 an ounce based on his model. He was also correct saying gold was overvalued years ago when gold was north of $1,300 based on his model. 
His model of the actual money supply is superior to anybody else that I have ever seen.
As I had originally said to you, "Gold right now is fairly valued". It is not expensive, nor is it undervalued. It is a fair price today at the $1,100 mark, but that does not mean it will not take years before it eventually resumes its upward trend.
I agree it is smart to be on the gold train, but there is no sense boarding the train if it isn't likely to leave the station for some time. If gold was to drop to somewhere below the $950 range, then it would be a different story. I would be happy to park some cash there. Otherwise, I have better places to park my money right now which make me a lot more than gold can.

Avi is good. I respect the Elliot Wave Principle and Fibonacci retracements which is what he basis the majority of his calculations on. Avi wrote an article not that long ago which calls for gold to have one more spike lower in price. 
(I dug it out rather than making you look for it).
This article he wrote back in June says that he thinks gold pushes down to the $700-$1100 level before making its next run up.
Yet when the rubber meets the road, Avi is a technical analyst, while Paul is more of a fundamental analyst. I respect both methodologies when it comes to price analysis, but when looking at any market, the fundamentals are the basis for all long term investments, while technicals drive the interpretation of the shorter timeframes within the fundamental analysis.

It does not say that bitcoin can be worth $300,000 by then. I am a believer in bitcoin, but people need to stop making up headlines which do not exist.
They made a reference to a certain percentage of GDP will exist on a blockchain by 2025. They did not say it had to be bitcoin´s blockchain.
In the same way that banks are exploring private blockchains, much of this GDP they reference having a home on a blockchain one day could easily be a private or semi private blockchain and NOT bitcoin´s blockchain.
Additionally, just because a certain amount of money gets pumped through bitcoin does not mean that you can accurately predict how that will affect the price. Frequently I see remarks saturated in this incorrect perception of how the pricing of bitcoin works.
It is not as simple as saying "If 10 trillion dollars flows through bitcoin, then the price will be $300,000".
In a thinly market, a small buyer or seller can push prices higher or lower than a big buyer or seller can in a deeply traded market at times.

Frequently over exaggerated  moves like that are seen at "blow off tops" and "blow off bottoms". Its capitulation where rationale be damned and the person either buying into the rally, or selling into the plunge sees prices moving faster and faster and just allows emotion to get the best of them. This frequently this occurs with higher than normal volume and frequently a reversal in the not to distant future is right around the corner.
A couple years ago, Silkroad (the original one) closed which pushed the price from $130 to $85 within a couple of trading days as people feared without Silkroad that bitcoin was doomed. 8 weeks later, the price was $1200.

The banks are so full of shit. They stated:
Large cash withdrawals are a thorny issue for banks because of the various scams which have seen some older people conned into handing over large sums of money to fraudsters. On top of that, banks are petrified about falling foul of the regulations on money laundering and financing crime, and being hit with huge fines, so they get twitchy about “unusual account activity”.
The reality is the difference between physical cash in the system versus fake money that banks create by simply adding ones and zeros into their ledger.
The US for example only has $1.38 Trillion of actual dollars in the form of bills, coins etc. Yet somehow there are tens of trillions of US dollars sitting in bank accounts.
The reality is the banks know that even if 5% of account holders attempted to pull out their collective balances the entire banking system would implode and be seen for the ponzi system that it really happens to be.
This is exactly what had happened during the 2008 meltdown that almost collapsed the monetary system. There was about $500 Billion which had attempted to leave the system in a very short amount of time, and we all know what happened after that.

You are the dipshit.
Chase has eliminated cash deposits.
Bank of America has eliminated cash deposits.
US Bank has eliminated cash deposits.
The only major bank left after these 3 is Wells Fargo.
Look at this link, it shows the top banks listed by number of available branches:
The banks have shut down 3 of the top 4 for cash deposits locations within the last 12 months, and this obviously means that Wells Fargo will follow suit sooner than later.
When Wells Fargo follows suit, bitcoin sellers are going to have a hard time asking buyers to make a cash deposit when there are no bank branches in their city or State.
The next bank on the list after the top 4 is PNC bank. I can tell you that there is not even one single branch of PNC in Los Angeles. (A couple mortgage locations, but nowhere to walk in and make a cash deposit).
So I stand by my original statement. If there are thousands of alternatives; then name me 25 different ones that anybody and everybody can use. You can't, because there isn't.
Good luck telling your next bitcoin buyer to go visit Louisiana Federal when he lives in Miami. 95% of bitcoin buyers who use cash deposits do not live in the same State, let alone the same city as the sellers.

Regulated by the FDA yes, of course, like anything that goes for sale within the USA, yet there are none of the costs involved for the R&amp;D like Pfizer had to incur to discover the pill.
If Jim Bob down the street has the money.....he can create his own generic version. He just needs to meet all the requirements and costs which are typically prohibitively expensive unless he has pharmaceutical company already.
For generics outside of the USA, the FDA has no control whatsoever. It all boils down to what country the drug is being manufactured in. Some countries have strict controlled substances laws like Canada, Australia, England etc, while there are other countries like China, Pakistan and the likes where the government doesn't care what the drug manufacturers are doing.
Obviously this leads some people looking for generics online to try to source some drugs from lesser regulated countries in the hopes of saving money, yet they risk not getting the effective ingredients that are found in properly regulated pharmaceutical labs such as the ones that the FDA regulates within the USA.

When the China Exchange opens later this year which requires physical delivery of gold and not paper trading like GLD it will smoke the illusion of prices which the manipulated Comex presents to you today.
The only reason prices are where they are at is because the USA government prints free worthless paper dollars to banks who then collude with the US government to naked short the paper markets to hold down the price of gold to artificially inflate the perceived value of the US dollar so they can keep interest rates as low as they are because they cannot afford to pay more on the Treasury bills which China holds.

For all intents and purposes you can send unlimited. The context of your statement was based on a company which has a $3,000 per month sending limit. Additionally you are referencing remittances to Philippines, so for 99.99% of people bitcoin will be able to scale in their minds to an unlimited amount because hardly anybody would ever need to send more than $25,000 at a time which will have zero impact on the price.
Additionally, if you needed to buy $250,000 of bitcoin, you could easily stagger the purchase over an hour instead of buying all at once and thus you wouldn't push up the price whatsoever on any exchange  which offered any real sense of liquidity.

I think the halving is on track for July/August...not Aug/Sept.
Considering this is mere months away, this single month makes a difference.
I think the halving will have the most dramatic affect on the price of bitcoin versus everything else.
Within a few months after the last halving the price was up over 1000%. Many people are aware of this, and in my opinion will probably try to front run the event in hopes of a repeat performance. 
Other important events are more geopolitical in nature which hold massive influence on the price as well. Things such as Greece having bail-ins, and China implementing capital controls. These 2 items will push capital into bitcoin and drive the price higher over this next year as well in my opinion.
Bitcoin sits at the top of my list of undervalued assets on the entire planet which have the most possible upside.

The run up in price from the last halving occurred months after the halving occurred. My guess is the run up will happen prior to the halving, but in my opinion, there is no way on Earth that the next halving is priced in yet.
I expect this next year will be an insane run up in price. We have China capital controls helping to push us higher right now. We also have Greece sitting on the edge of bail ins. We also have the frontrunners who will try to get ahead of the halving, and finally, we have the tangible effect of the halving happening in July.
I have loaded the boat with bitcoin and I expect a year from now I will be very happy that I did.

A friend and myself fell victim to this exact same "man in the middle" scam.
Fake Ebay auction triggered a victim to deposit cash into our Bank of America account. Scammer sends us proof that a cash deposit was made into our account. We send the bitcoin to the scammer. Victim contacted our bank accusing us of scamming the victim. Bank takes the money out of our account, and returns it to the victim, and then closes our bank account for selling bitcoin.
I feel sympathy for this guy. If I didn't know anything about bitcoin (like Judge Judy), and I heard this guy's story, I would think he had scammed the truck buyer as well.
This is the one episode of Judge Judy where I would be willing to bet that she got it wrong.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but you will not find one person who will buy your Bolivars at the government rate.
I considered flying down to Venezuela 2 years ago to try to arbitrage the difference in price. After a bit of research I found out that nobody wants their Bolivars. You cannot just go down there and buy them on the black market and bring them to a different country and sell them for the government rate. There are only like 2 countries in all of the world who will accept Venezuelan Bolivars. Both of those countries border Venezuela, and they are also only willing to pay what the black market rate happens to be.
When you step off the airplane as a tourist you will get swamped with people selling you black market Bolivars. Nobody other than a complete idiot would ever accept the government rate.

Why would "it" do that can be answered in many different ways. I will highlight one way it could lose its status, and hopefully it will provide you with a glimpse into why it could go to $18,000.
One of the reasons why the US has not experienced hyper inflation as of yet, as a result of all the money printing it has conducted, is because of the petrodollar status. Because oil is priced in US dollars, it means that all oil trade up until recently has been in US dollars. The pricing of oil in dollars gives the dollar a sense of purpose because people need it if they want to buy oil.
Recently Russia and China signed a bi lateral trade agreement. It is the first of its kind, and it allows for the sale of Russian oil to Chinese, and the pricing of the oil is not in US dollars.
Circumventing the US dollar like this nullifies much of its usability, and as a result, those US dollars which were typically held by foreign governments for the purchase of oil, will now find their way home to the USA. As all those US dollars work their way into the US financial system, you will have too many dollars chasing too few assets, and it is in this environment where we could see hyper inflation, and as a result, $18,000 is rather cheap if the US loses its petrodollar status.

I have no idea for many reasons. First of all trying to pick a price is something that is almost impossible to guess. Additionally, it depends on how much time you are willing to hold bitcoin for.
For example, I am guessing it will hit a new all time high within the next 12 months, yet I would also guess that years later a new all time high will be achieved once again. Years after that another new all time high.
The only thing we can really try to do to guess at what the price might be is to compare it to other asset or currency classes to guesstimate what its potential price might be.
For example, it bitcoin achieves just 5% of the total value of all the gold on the planet (assuming the price of gold remains at current levels), then bitcoin would be priced at $25,000 each. 
I personally think that achieving this price is completely reasonable. How long it takes to get to that level is anybody's guess. It could take  2 years, or it could take 10 years. Based on past price performance, I would guess it will be closer to 2 years than 10 years, but honestly that is just me guessing because nobody can say for sure.

Imagine there are 2 lines of people. The people in one line want to buy. The people in the other line want to sell.
During price stability there are an equal amount of people wanting to buy and sell. Buyers are matched up with sellers easily and since there is much liquidity (ample buyers and sellers), the prices tend to stay within a tight range.
Eventually a shortage of people develops in one of the lines. If there is a shortage of buyers, then the prices drop. If there is a shortage of sellers, then the prices will rise.
As prices rise, this will trigger additional sellers and buyers at the same time. Sellers are enticed by higher prices, and buyers are enticed by the possibility of making quick returns on a rapidly moving price upwards. 
Essentially it boils down to the laws of supply and demand, and the laws of fear versus greed.

I hope so. 
I think with the capital controls happening in China right now, combined with potential Greek bail-ins coming soon, combined with the next halving happening in 8 months that there are a lot of people who will be buying bitcoin over the course of the next 12 months.
4 months after the last halving occurred the price of bitcoin went up over 1000%. Obviously anything can happen, but I see more potential upside in bitcoin than any other asset class at the moment.
Bond market is in an enormous bubble. Stock market is in a bubble. Real estate in many markets seems frothy and vulnerable with interest rates sitting essentially at 0%.
If the bond market blows up which I think it will, this will cause interest rates to go up even though the Federal Reserve wants them this low so they can attempt to service their incredible debt load. If the rates go up, then that should pop real estate as well as the stock market.
So even though it sounds "gutsy" to have all my eggs in one basket...it actually looks safer than the alternatives. Sometimes diversification simply introduces risk.
I suppose I like the precious metals as well (especially silver), but I am hoping to hold bitcoin for the next 12 months until after the halving occurs (or unless a price point hits before that time), and then assuming silver has not exploded yet I will be able to rotate everything into silver. 
God willing silver runs while the real estate market implodes and then I rotate everything into real estate. 
This is how I want it all to happen over the next 5-10 years, but I realize I am asking for a lot.

Just look at it honestly and not from your personal experience. Bitcoin had been running from $5 to $1200 for a couple years. You bought near the top after a big run.
Now the reality is that there has been 2 years of profit taking.
There has not been a new low for almost a year.
To me it appears like we have just put in a triple bottom. 
Read about the significance of triple bottoms here:
My advice is give it another year. If we can break above $318 which is the resistance point, my guess is that we are going to see a reversal and the next long term trend will be an uptrend.
I know it sucks holding something which has gone down, but you have held this long...just give it some more time.

If you are looking to get into bitcoin, pull the trigger right here @ $387 and then sit back.
It might drop to $300, but that doesn't mean you lost anything if you hold through that period. Though if you decide to wait and this pops back up to $450, then you really did lose part of your upside.

Its not a baseless prediction its based on technical analysis, and over 25 years of trading stocks successfully using this exact same analysis.
If you knew anything about TA you would see as clearly as anybody that we are in an oversold position right now. Looking at the 12 hour chart (which is a fairly reliable chart for picking movements within a 7 -15 day trading range) you could see that the Williams % is oversold.
You probably don't know why its called the Williams %, so allow me to educate your dumb hillbilly ass.
Larry Williams developed this technical tool to determine the best entry and exit points for trading stocks. His Williams % tool is so good that he entered the world's most famous stock trading competition, where the best of the best go up against each other, and whoever has the highest net return after 12 months is crowned "trader of the year". He won the competition 2 years in a row. One of the years he netted  11,000% in his portfolio. (that's right 11 thousand percent...not a misprint). He turned $10,000 into $1,100,000 in one year.
Here is his Wiki page verifying my statements:
He was so confident in his system that he taught his daughter Michelle Williams. Michelle Williams is that actress who married Heath Ledger (played the Joker in Batman, and then died on set).
Michelle won the competition as well when she entered, and she was just an actress and not a professional trader.
here is a link to a bunch of his students who have also won the competition year after year.:
I use the Williams % tool as one of the tools to determine when the odds are at their highest for key turning points, and I do rather well with it as well.
So, with respect to your jackass comment about my "baseless prediction"...it isn't baseless whatsoever. It is based on the teachings of probably the best trader that walks the planet today.
What do you base your trading on?
Just FYI, this is the chart that gives me the "buy" signal:
See how the Williams is now in an oversold position? Anything higher than a reading of 80, while the MACD is in a positive position is a high probability trade that sometime within the next 7-15 days that we will see higher prices.

I think it goes much higher than $9,000 eventually.
If it hit $25,000 per bitcoin, that would be 5% of the market cap of all the gold on the planet, which I feel is very conservative.

I think you are forgetting something.
If you look at the chart for the CAPE ratio I supplied which covers over 100 years of trading, you need to remember that there were countless times over the last century where there was "high expected inflation" as well as monetary systems coming to an end, and during all of those previous times of turmoil and uncertainty, there were only 2 times in history where the ratio got higher than where we sit today.
Right before the 2 major crashes I already mentioned.
Logic and common sense should tell anybody with an IQ higher than room temperature that the market is overvalued right now.
This is NOT the time to be in the stock market. This is the time where the stock market should be shorted.
If I was to buy anything in the market today, it would be SPXS which is a triple leveraged ETF inversely tied to the movement of the S&amp;P.
On days where the S&amp;P goes down 1%, this would go up 3%, and vice versa.
This market is going to crash, and history tells us, that rarely does it ever get to levels this high before it does.

It is called a "triple bottom"
DEFINITION OF 'TRIPLE BOTTOM'
A pattern used in technical analysis to predict the reversal of a prolonged downtrend. The pattern is identified when the price of an asset creates three troughs at nearly the same price level. The third bounce off the support is an indication that buying interest (demand) is outweighing selling interest (supply) and that the trend is in the process of reversing.

I mean this with the most respect possible my friend, but I am afraid you are simply wrong on multiple fronts. 
The nature of this discussion revolves around your declaration that you felt that Zerohedge was incorrect in their understanding as to what was happening in China.
In reality, Zerohedge has been correct, and in fact it is you who is incorrect. The capital controls in question as referenced by Zerohedge relates directly to a Chinese resident's inability to get their money out of China.
You may have been under the impression that the exchange controls are the most common form of capital control, but in reality, exchange controls are not capital controls. Feel free to read the Wikipedia explanation of what a capital control actually is. You can read that here   
The reality is, as Zerohedge has clearly stated, that capital controls are a residents inability to move the money out of the country.
You may be correct in your statement that there are exchange control issues....frankly I do not know if there are or not, but in reality, we are not discussing exchange controls. As per your opening paragraph, we are discussing capital controls.....not exchange controls.
I think your misunderstanding is rooted in your incorrect understanding of what capital controls actually are.

Think of it like the George Foreman Grill. Is there anything special about the GFG compared to any of the other grills out there? Of course not, but what the GFG does have is name recognition. It offers the end user that warm and fuzzy feeling that if this dude is willing to endorse it, then it must be better than all the others.
The Winklevii are just an endorsement...nothing more. Yet never underestimate the power of endorsements. Companies pay big bucks for endorsements because endorsements can work wonders in convincing the average Joe to choose the endorsed product/service over a comparable non-endorsed item.
Are there any benefits for us as traders by choosing this exchange over the multitude of others? Probably not much initially, yet I would hazard to guess that as months go by, their endorsement will cause many people to choose their "brand" of exchange over the others, which will translate into a nice deep order book which offers higher liquidity.
Ultimately there is no real reason to be excited about this exchange. Its just water-cooler talk for all us who have nothing better to discuss on a Thursday afternoon.

I love this part of the article, which highlights the fact that this is indeed Visa looking at using the "bitcoin blockchain" as compared to a "private blockchain" like all the other banks:
Bitcoin’s security and network effects, he asserted, make it the ideal blockchain for enterprise clients like Visa Europe that are seeking to extend their payment systems. For example, he suggested that if one bitcoin services provider went down, the open nature of the bitcoin platform would allow users to route payments through another provider.
“You can transfer value dynamically on a per transaction basis because [bitcoin] is an open network,” he continued. “It’s not that we’re not bound to one provider, but even further, you don’t need to know in advance which providers you’re going to use.”
Yago used this strength as evidence of his belief in the bitcoin blockchain.

Basically "yes", if somebody fancies themselves as a chart technician and is losing money on a regular basis, they probably have misguided notions as how to trade. 
Keep in mind there is not one single resource on the internet that will teach anybody how to trade properly. There are many good resources which help teach portions of technical analysis but there is not a single one which will weave it all together into an easy to understand "formula" (probably not the right word, but I hope you understand what I mean).
I am 48 years old and started to learn about TA about 25 years ago. Nobody taught me a thing, but that's not to say that I did not derive much of my knowledge from other people's efforts. Probably one of the most valuable pieces of information that I came across in the years of learning (and I am still learning to this day, and still make mistakes to this day) is Elliot Wave Theory. 
Many people think that TA is simply looking for things like double bottoms, or inverted head and shoulder patterns, or flag formations. They think they can simply look for these patterns and then try to time entry points based on where the RSI is in conjunction with the MACD, but its not that simple. Then when their trade goes south they get upset saying that TA is hogwash.
The people who eventually learn how to trade profitably using TA are in no hurry to share the information with anybody because, well, why should they, and why would they? There is no financial incentive large enough to give away a life's worth of effort and learning.

This is what happens with all assets which trade in open markets.
Real estate will frequently lose 30%+ when crashes happen, only to eventually come back and create all time highs over and over again.
The same thing happens with stocks, as well as precious metals like gold and silver.
Take a look at the price of silver 4 years ago. It costs $45 per ounce, and today that same ounce sells for $14.
It doesn't mean anything is wrong with silver, or that it is going to zero, or flawed. It is just a natural event which transpires across all tradable asset classes.

I know insider trading is reserved for publicly traded companies and that bitcoin does not fall into this category. I have traded securities for over 25 years.
With that being the case, the term "insider trading" is not a perfect choice of words (perhaps I should have said (front-running instead of insider trading), but I think anybody with a modicum of common sense can see the parallel being drawn.
The whole point I was making still stands.
There was about a half million dollars which flowed into bitcoin 2 hours prior to the Coindesk news release. I wonder if anybody who works at Coindesk decided to front run the news release in anticipation of the news being deemed as a positive for the price of bitcoin in the near future.

I think the bond market, stock market, most real estate markets and such are overvalued and likely to drop.

Sadly it happens all around the world. I was mistaken earlier when I said that Vancouver was the least affordable city on the planet.
Hong Kong is ranked number 1, and Vancouver is ranked as the second least affordable city on the entire planet.
After we had the Olympics in Vancouver in 2010 we had a lot of prime downtown condos which had been built for the athletes come available for sale. These were snapped up by the Chinese 5 years ago. If you look in the windows of these condos, they are all empty. Nobody lives there. The condo is just a storage facility for the corrupt money. It is not uncommon for a completely sold out building to have 30% occupancy rates. Simultaneously, people who actually hold jobs in Vancouver as teachers, firemen, police officers, nurses etc are forced out of the city because they cannot afford to live close to their jobs. Its just crazy.

Nobody should be touching the stock market right now. The CAPE ratio (cost adjusted price to earnings ratio created by Robert Shiller) is sitting at about 25 right now.
there were only two other times in the last 100+ years where the stock market was valued higher:
1)Right before the crash of 1929
2)Right before the dot com crash
The markets are going to crash very soon. Maybe a year from now, maybe a month from now, maybe even sooner.
With frothy valuations like we see today, it is better to be a year early than one day late side-stepping the carnage which is coming to Wallstreet in the not-too-distant future.

I don't want to correct you.....but I will because you are wrong.
Fiat currency has had nothing to do with economic growth, so erase that from your mind right now.
Coming off the gold standard did not cause huge economic growth. What it did was cause massive inflation as the value of the US dollar plunged once it lost its pegging to the price of gold.
This massive inflation can be mistaken for economic growth by the untrained eye because the inflation causes salaries to go up, and they cause real estate prices to go up, and as a result of the higher prices, people mistakenly confuse this with economic growth.
The reality is whatever increase in wages that are witnessed are offset by the increase in the cost of living. 
As an example, when Zimbabwe experienced hyper inflation, the value of their money plummeted, their stock market exploded in value, and the ravages of the money printing destroyed any illusion of economic growth.

True, but as residents of Venezuela and similar inflation stricken countries wake up to bitcoin's ability to shield them from their government's rapidly devaluing currencies, people will commit the bolivars, and pesos and actually begin to push the price up in dollar terms; which of course creates a positive feedback loop in their native currency, and helps create the next bubble price eclipsing the last dollar high price point.

It is painful trying to read their stories because there are always these little errors where the wrong word is chosen, punctuation is incorrect, and there is no real "meat on the bone" with respect to actual insight into any topic.

This could certainly be one of the factors helping to propel prices higher at the moment.

For somebody who says they have lived there off and on I am surprised by your statement. Based on your logic, I can see why you think Zerohedge is incorrect, yet the problem lies in your understanding of what capital controls are versus Zerohedge's explanation of the situation.
Capital controls are not a person's inability to convert the Chinese currency from the Renminbi into an alternative currency as you suggest.
Capital controls are the inability of that person to extract that currency outside of China. So it does not matter if a person can convert their money from Renminbi to any other currency. It is a matter of getting that money out of the country, and this is where bitcoin shines. Bitcoin circumvents the capital controls completely.

If it reached the same size as the current 6th largest currency reserve currency, this would give it a market cap of  about $110 Billion, or about $10,000 per bitcoin.

I would not doubt it if we hit that price point within the next 24 months.
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:02:39
My guess is we continue to trend upwards for the next 6-9 months. Then the halving occurs next July and I expect the price will begin to make new ATH after that. 
The capital controls happening in China should continue to propel us higher immediately, and then the anticipation of the halving will trigger even more buyers as we start off the next year, and then the simple reality of the halving will further reduce the amount of net sellers which will culminate in a $2,500 or higher price within the next 12-24 months.

You obviously do not know me, nor do you live in Vancouver.
Vancouver has a major problem with corrupt money coming from China. The Canadian government does not check the source of funds when a non-citizen buys a house in Vancouver. As such we a have massive, and I mean massive problem with untold billions of dollars flowing into Vancouver and bidding the prices of homes up by insane amounts.
For example, it is not uncommon for a house to be listed for $1,000,000 (and this would just be a piece of crap house...total teardown kind of property), and a Chinese "investor" will walk up and offer $1,300,000 for the home. There is not a bidding war going on the warrant the increase in price, it is just a lone offer coming in at 30, or 40 or 50% over asking just because the person looks at the money as free money since it is frequently stolen. (Obviously there are countless extremely honourable Chinese people who come to Vancouver who didn't steal their money, but I am highlighting a well documented issue which Vancouver is experiencing right now).
The "investor" does not care if he/she pays too much because they stole the money frequently from their own citizens and are looking for a country which has a "no-questions-asked" policy on source of funds, and Vancouver, London, Dubai are usually sitting at the top of their lists of cities because of our government policies. Their main concern is getting the money out of China fast, and getting it invested into something fast before they are caught.
With respect to my comment about the signs being totally in Chinese, take a look at this article written in the Vancouver Sun with is Vancouver's largest newspaper:
If you notice sign in the photo, that is what all the signs in the city look like now which essentially makes long term residents a visitor in their own town.
I am not racist whatsoever. I am somebody who is discussing an issue which is so commonly spoken of in Vancouver, that it warrants articles such as the above listed article in our largest newspaper.

I agree. My friend and I are both living outside the USA, and this happened within the USA. We tried as best as we could to get the bank to get off their asses to file a police report, and they did nothing. We were strung along the usual chain of bureaucracy, including being sent through a bank appointed arbitrator who was supposed to act as if he is a neutral 3rd party, when in fact he is paid by the bank. We pushed our paperwork eventually outside the hands of BOA and their appointees to some governing bureau (the name escapes me), and were eventually denied our claim to get our money back.
After this, we changed out policy for cash deposits. Anybody wanting to make a cash deposit needed to supply a photocopy of their government issued ID. They needed to hand write a note stating that "I, John Doe, am making a cash deposit into our account for the purpose of buying bitcoin" (which was laid on top of the photograph of their government issued ID).
We didn't have any instances of fraud after we did this. Live and learn.

MACD is not flawed. The MACD on a weekly basis went positive January(ish) of 2012 when the price was about $5. (This was one of your buy signals)
Then it turned negative for the first time in May 2014 when the price was between $400-$500. (This was one of your sell signals).
Now the MACD is going positive again for the first time in a year and half. (This is another buy signal, which will be confirmed when you see a price breakout about previous resistance of $318).

I disagree 100%. The movements that I have seen in bitcoin track exactly as they should with technical analysis.
My guess is that you just don't understand TA.
If you go back and chart the prices technically, there are zero deviances from what you would expect.
For example the MACD on a weekly basis began to go negative in March 2014 and the prices have followed suit perfectly.
We are now seeing the MACD on the weekly chart turning positive for the first time in a year and a half, while simultaneously completing the triple bottom.
This is the very first week in 1.5 years where a technical trader (who knows what he is doing) would actually enter a long position. (Assuming we see a price movement above $318, which is why I posted the title to this thread as such).

It is so easy to send bitcoin instead of wires nowadays. The recipient in Canada could sell the bitcoin immediately at CAvirtex, and initiate a withdrawal to their bank account. CAvirtex will charge .8% to sell the bitcoin, plus a $10 transfer fee to send the fiat to the recipient's bank account. It usually takes 2 business days to arrive.
Sending through your bank costs $523 including FX and wire costs.
Sending with bitcoin would have cost about $65 with all fees.

I have a Chinese friend who went to school with me in Richmond, and his father had to pay off one of the employees at the Motor Vehicle Branch to give him his drivers license. This was about 30 years ago and paid the guy $3,000 back then. 
He had no clue how to drive. He did not speak a word of English, so this made it impossible for him to take the written exam. His actual driving was worse than his English. I remember being in the backseat of his Volvo one day as he drove us somewhere and he literally would drive up on the sidewalk multiple times during the course of a 15 minute drive.
There was huge crackdown on the employees at the motor vehicle branch who were running this "pay for a license program" many years ago. I am not sure if it is still happening now or not.
Richmond now is probably about 75%-80% Chinese. It is safe to say that the Chinese congregate in Richmond more than any other part of the Lower Mainland. 
Greater Vancouver has always been extremely culturally diverse, and I appreciate growing up surrounded by such diversity. One of the best things about having such diversity is the fact that Vancouver has an incredible selection of authentic restaurants. Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Italian, Mediterranean, Greek, African. I probably would never have had the opportunity to enjoy such a diverse selection of cuisine if I had not grown up in Vancouver.

I happen to be an employer who hires sometimes from Upwork. 
Hopefully this helps us a little bit.
I just posted this on the thread to help push our cause:
I have been an employer here at Upwork (Odesk) for several years. I have hired many freelancers here as well as on other freelancer websites. I have spent between $5,000-$10,000 hiring freelancers on this site alone. Even though I do not participate in the forums prior to this post, I decided to make this my first post because of my belief in bitcoin as an extremely valuable addition to Upwork.
As an employer, I would applaud Upwork if they allowed me to pay in bitcoin. If I happened to be a freelancer, I would also see massive benefits to having this as an option for payment.
I am amazed all all the negative comments about bitcoin by these diehard forum lurkers who clearly know nothing about bitcoin whatsoever. The majority of these negative comments are rooted in absolute ignorance about bitcoin. 
The benefits to Upwork for accepting bitcoin are as follows:
1)It lowers the cost of accepting payments. It is cheaper than credit cards, Paypal, and wire transfers.
2)It is chargeback proof, which now eliminates 100% of the chargeback risk associated with credit cards and Paypal.
3)It gives Upwork access to their money faster than credit cards and Paypal.
4)It provides employers an additional method of paying for all these fine freelancers who work hard for their money.
5)Every major company which accepts bitcoin such as Expedia, Overstock, Dell and Microsoft have all publicly declared that they saw an uptick in sales as a direct result of people looking for a place to spend their bitcoin. The same would happen for Upwork. (I would happily give Upwork all my business if they accepted bitcoin).
6)The bitcoin community is fanatically enthusiastic about their belief in bitcoin and reward companies who allow them to pay with it.
7)There is no risk whatsoever of exposure to the fluctuations in value when accepting bitcoin. All Upwork would have to do is team up with a company such as Bitpay who will immediately convert the bitcoin to fiat dollars at a cost of 1%, which is still way cheaper than credit cards and Paypal.
The benefits to the freelancers if bitcoin was offered as a payout method:
1)The more payment options you have, the better.
2)It costs you less to accept bitcoin than Paypal. This means more money for you! Don't we all want more money?
3)Paypal can freeze your money without any reason because you are allowing a third party to hold your funds. This cannot ever happen with bitcoin because you control your money at all times.
4)No government, creditor, judge, or bank can ever seize your money when it is in bitcoin.
5)If you decided to spend the bitcoin, instead of saving it or converting it to fiat currency, this payment now provides you with protection against identity fraud. When you hand somebody a credit card online you are always running the risk of identity theft. When paying with bitcoin, you never have to reveal anything about your own identity or your banking or credit credentials. How many times have we heard stories about hackers stealing millions of credit card numbers from "trusted companies". This could never happen if people used bitcoin.

I have never been a financial advisor for a multitude of reasons, though I have many very close friends who are stock brokers. One funny (or maybe not so funny) thing about the training that stock brokers receive to pass their series seven exam is that they are never taught "how to make money". Nobody teaches them technical analysis, or much beyond the simplest of fundamental analysis. 
With respect to being able to make an "incredible amount of income with even a low fee", this is completely inaccurate because the majority of what I trade in the stock market involves companies which have market caps below $100,000,000 and with daily trade volumes of only a few million dollars. If I was trading my client's account on their behalf, I would never make as much money as I do now trading my own account because frequently my own purchasing power is enough to move the price of a stock. I simply would never be able to get my own clients into what I like to trade. If I think a stock is going to move up 50% in price, and I am correct, this obviously pays me a lot more than the 1% that I might be able to claim as a commission.

This remittance guy failed because he is trying take a piece of the pie, and is piecing off multiple players along the way.
Bitcoin is perfect for this market. It just is not perfect when there are guys trying to make money off the process.
Here is how the perfect market exists:
1)Buyer of bitcoin sends money to an exchange. Many exchanges offer a free method of doing this.
2)Buyer buys bitcoin for an exchange fee at the market of approximately .5 of 1%.
3)Buyer sends money to recipient for free.
4)Receiver sells bitcoin at market rates and pays another half a percent.
5)Receiver transfers funds from exchange to his bank account for nominal fee.
Total costs are usually between 1-2%.
Eliminate the middle man and eliminate the costs.

Obviously I am only guessing, but if you look at what happened after the last halving, you will see that the run up in price occurred a couple months after the halving actually happened.
My guess is that since that happened, and people like you and I are discussing it, it stands to reason that some investors will attempt to front run the next halving which is why I think we will see a steady climb in price between then and now.
Watch this video and you will see that this guy agrees with my statement, and the fact that there are already 3000 views of this video leads me to believe that others will follow suit as well.

@_date: 2015-10-07 15:44:39
Not necessarily. I know for a fact that there are lots of people who use bitcoin to pay for something. When the payment is completed, frequently there is a small amount of bitcoin left in the person´s wallet which was not used for the transaction.
As more and more people leave that"spare change" in their wallets, this effectively takes those bitcoin out of play. Eventually if and when enough people do this, it can have a dramatic effect on the price.
I have heard countless stories a few years ago when people said "I left 5 or 10 bitcoin in my wallet because it was not worth much". Then the price went from $12 to $1,200 and suddenly people scrambled looking through old computers for their bitcoin.
People did it before with their spare change, and I guarantee they are doing it again right now.
Not everybody is holding their bitcoin for that surge in price as you stated.

Various places do not do this.
Bitgold requires that you register with them and they hold the gold which you have to trust that they are not pulling the same scam that the Comex is pulling right now.
I am talking about a place where you can walk in person and hand somebody a gold brick, or bar or coin and get bitcoin.

Thus I stand by my statement that this makes bitcoin better than gold. You can buy gold with bitcoin, but you cannot buy bitcoin with gold.

I think you are the one who is confounded. The author speaks about bitcoin as a means of avoiding capital controls. It does not imply that the Chinese will look to use bitcoin just as a mechanism to go from one fiat to another fiat. They could easily park their money in bitcoin for a year especially if they are looking at conditions like we are seeing right now. Bitcoin has gone up 15% in the last month which might be viewed as an attractive investment vehicle while simultaneously avoiding capital controls.
If the Chinese feel that bitcoin might continue to move upwards in anticipation of the next halving next summer, then we are indeed speaking about an increase in the market capitalization versus just usage as that $22 trillion enters a vehicle which only has a $3 billion market cap.

In my opinion the next $10 in either direction is going to be the deciding point to watch.
If we can get above $660 and hold for 12 hours or more...thats the confirmation to the upside.
If we go below $640 and hold for 12 hours or more.....thats the confirmation to the downside.
Typically pennant breakouts move in the direction of the previous large move, which in this case was to the upside, so if I had to lay my ten cent bet....it would be that we continue the upside move once the price confirmation has been made.
As a side note, it is interesting that the webbot made a prediction that bitcoin moves higher once we past July 12th.

Its unrealistic to think that you could pierce this market in any meaningful way without having some sort of competitive advantage than websites such as Shutterstock, iStockphoto, Getty, Pond 5 etc.
If your only advantage is to offer a price advantage, then I suggest you abandon the idea. There are already companies out there which offer huge discounts compared to the big websites I mentioned such as Photodune.com which is part of the Envato marketplace which is a huge company. Photodune offers prices which are less than half the price of Shutterstock.
Plus there are other stock photo and stock video sites which offer prices even cheaper than Photodune.
I am a contributor who sells stock video at iStockphoto, and I looked into the possibility of starting up my own version of these sites until I really looked into who the competition was and realized that this would be an extremely difficult endeavor to pursue.
For starters, before you get any meaningful traffic who will actually buy your product, you are going to need a good inventory, and when I say good inventory, I mean you will need at least 50,000 good photos.....not just any photo....I mean good photos. Anything less than that as a starting point, then don't bother because any money and time you invest to draw buyers to a site with less than that will be lost because the buyers will remember your site as not having good inventory.
The money that is made in this business is made from repeat buyers....not one offs. These businesses depend on buyers returning month after month.
I am a buyer as well as a contributor, and I can tell you the most important thing for me is selection. 
Good luck.

Imagine when you shuffle a deck of cards. Even if you place 26 cards into each hand and try to feather them together with a shuffle. Do they get interlaced equally? Usually they do not. Sometimes they will shuffle with equal distribution and sometimes the cards get shuffled so that multiple cards from one stack of the 26 cards get laid on top of each other. The same thing happens with ownership of stocks, and bitcoin. The markets encounter periods of an imbalance between buyers and sellers and you get a whipsaw in price action.
For the record I have been trading stocks for 25 years and this is my personal way of looking at this imbalance which caused spikes and drops in prices. Ultimately the fundamentals of the underlying security will dictate the direction of price, but all the smaller moves which occur in between the longer term trend movements are usually imbalances of ownership combined with emotional reactions to inconsequential microeconomics rather than macroeconomics surrounding the security.

Interesting.......I know they have been working on replacing Vogogo as their payment processor inside of Canada, and perhaps they are focused on that since they need to have a replacement in place within the next few days or else they have no way of servicing the Canadian market.
The closure of Vogogo was what triggered Coinbase to close its Canadian operations recently, so this must be weighing heavily on their minds especially when you consider Kraken just bought out CAVirtex which was Canada's largest bitcoin exchange, and as such probably cost them a lot of money to acquire.

CAVirtex was great with their response rates to ticket inquiries, but ever since Kraken took over, every since month takes longer than the previous month for them to simply answer a ticket.
Kraken keeps saying they keep hiring more customer service reps, yet every month they need longer and longer. I have had many conversations with them trying to explain that they are in danger of losing me as a client if they don't get their act together.
I suppose one of these days I will have to stop threatening to leave and just leave Kraken once and for all. God knows there is no shortage of exchanges that would love to have my business.

Respectfully......that's not how it works. The reason why governments can control the price with gold and silver is because price discovery for gold and silver happen through the Comex. This is not actual gold and silver being bought and sold. These are derivatives of the metal. As such, the derivative price sets the price for the hard metal.
In our situation with bitcoin, the bitcoin market sets the price for the cryptocurrency as compared to the derivative which in this example is the ETN.

Sort of like a jet liner which had climbed to its cruising altitude and then leveling off.
So even though the hash rate did not drop off, it did indeed level off as the miners gave up.

Are you kidding? That's like saying that computers should of died because learning MSDOS was too hard. One day Bill Gates popped onto the scene and created Windows and suddenly the computer was understood by the masses.
The same thing will happen with bitcoin. Bitcoin will have its "Windows moment" when some improvement to btc which is still hidden from all of today will occur which will break down many perceived technical barriers.

What about my Canadian Tire money? Guess I better liquidate while I can.

Do you see the yellow reflection of the rock in the water. If the reflection of the tree overlaps the reflection of the rock, its a buy signal.

I originally used CAVirtex because they were a Canadian exchange, and I felt the withdrawal times would be faster.
Yet, since Kraken has taken over, withdrawal times have increased to weeks instead of days.
I hate to say it, but now, Bitstamp is starting to look more attractive to me. The withdrawal fee will be a little higher, but at least they reply to tickets, and I can get my money in a reasonable amount of time.

We are in the E wave of the Elliot Wave Theory which is the final selloff wave before we resume upwards.
As additional confirmation, we can see we are oversold on the Williams % indicator.
As an additional confirmation, this sell off has registered a very low MACD reading which tells us the momentum is easing.
The next leg is up, and it will be strong over the course of the coming weeks and months.
My guess is we see $1,000 by Labor Day weekend.

I receive wires from Kraken to my RBC account as well and I have never had a wire fail. They take longer than I want, but they always eventually show up.
Its probably just an error on their end attempting to send Pound instead of dollar.

For starters, you are conflating opinion with useless variables. Stop doing that. Start over by emptying your mind of preconceived notions because they are wrong.
It sounds like you are on the fence with respect to investing in bitcoin and you would like some hard facts as to why it is a good investment.
You need to understand what a market cap is for starters. A market cap or market capitalization is the actual price of something. Not its intrinsic value, but its current market price. To determine the market cap of something, you need to multiply its current price by the total amount of units outstanding. 
A stock for example has its market cap determined by multiplying the share price by the total amount of shares outstanding.
Bitcoin is the same. You multiply the price of $2,880 by the total amount of bitcoin outstanding, and the get the market cap.
Bitcoin needs to be looked at in market cap terms, and not price per bitcoin to determine how big bitcoin could really get, and thus, how much of a return on your investment could be achieved by buying bitcoin today at these prices.
Bitcoin has an approximate market cap of $50 billion right now. This sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but it is a small amount when you look at how big bitcoin has the potential of getting one day.
The ultimate reason why bitcoin is worth $50 billion is because people have migrated out of other asset classes into bitcoin. Perhaps they simply exchanged dollars, or euros, or yen. Perhaps they sold gold, stocks, bonds or some other asset class to raise the funds to buy bitcoin.
If you look at the total amount of wealth which is stored in all the various asset classes globally, there is about $250 trillion. Thus you could loosely say the market cap of the world is $250 trillion.
If even 1% of that wealth flows into bitcoin, the price of bitcoin will need to swell to $100,000 to accommodate the inflow of wealth.
Ignore segwit or bip148 and focus on the bigger picture.

If you do not make a profit, then you have very little incentive to maintain the project, improve upon its offerings, and are likely to vanish after a short amount of time.
If you truly make something which is of value to the community, then you should be able to capitalize on your idea.
If your idea cannot justify a payment being made, then frankly, your service probably is of little value to others and will fail to attract enough people for you to call this venture a success.
(Just my 2 cents since you asked).

They call it an "Anti Counterfeiting Act". This of course does not include government sanctioned counterfeiting of your dollars with money printing.....................when the government does it, its called "inflation".
If the government is permitted to do so, they will take us all well beyond anything George Orwell could have imagined.
