The buyers are individuals though. The way the price was keeping to a  trend so tightly and being thrust back into place when it deviated and people tried to dump wasn't a bunch of noob investors though. Plus, there is no pile of bitcoin ready to be dumped, just at worst a lack of buyers moving forward. I really think this is all in our heads.

Why would you come to reddit just to show how lazy you are? There are thousands of resources online to cure your ignorance before coming to ask someone to spoon feed it to you.

Your business will fail within 12 months, I'll put money on it. What kind of a stupid idiot refuses to take people's money and decides for then what they should or should not trade. Bcash is trash, but you're just plain dumb. What were you expecting? Some free publicity for your exchange that nobody has ever heard of? GTFO and come back when you hit puberty.

Luckily I live in the UK and paying taxes to the UK government would be funding terrorism, and I ain't no terrorist.

Not connected to the faster payments system. There is Fidor though.

Commercial banks create 95% of money, not governments. Other than that, great

Get it reported. It could be exploitable.

Don't underestimate how long it will take. Coins being sent to exchange etc. It will fall further.

The blockchain is totally healthy right now. Less than 10k unconfirmed transactions in the memory pool during a surge is nothing. If anything it pretty fantastic. Double your fee if your in a rush. Even if there was a million unconfirmed tx (impossible I think)  you could still jump the queue for less than a quarter. Thats what they refer to as the formation of a fee market.

This is never going to make it to the front page, people make a living by not sharing this info. An open source universal app like this across exchanges would be awesome though. Sort of like rippling the liquidity between exchanges where it's needed. I believe it would go a long way to reducing volatility. It would make markets more efficient too. It would be similar to ripple again in that you would need to specify which exchanges you trust though.

Kraken front run the market. There's no reason why a company that understands bitcoin should demand 6 confirms.
