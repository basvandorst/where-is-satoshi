So if he bought at $13.3k and sold at $16.5k, he made about $27.4 million. After capital gains, it'll be more like $17.5 - $20 million.

Seeing as the average price of a bitcoin was $450 in 2014, this investment would now be worth over $600,000. Is this true?

So for a merchant to accept Bitcoin, they'd need to understand what it actually was. I'd say less than 1 in 20 Americans would fully understand cryptos, and I doubt a corner-shop in Baltimore would.

There can be up to 21 million bitcoin. If 1 BTC was worth $10 mil, as you predicted, the total value of these would be $210,000,000,000,000 - or $210 trillion. 
So are you saying that in 10-20 years, Bitcoin will grow on such a scale that it fundamentally destroys every other currency on the planet?
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:26:56
You've got $1mil in BTC? Puts you in the top 20k bitcoin wallets - up there with businesses.

Unlike the iPhone, Bitcoin isn't widely advertised. If I asked the off-license on my street whether he knew about Bitcoin - he'd almost certainly answer no. 
What I was trying to get at is before Bitcoin can be widely adopted (and thus lose some volatility) there needs to be some sort of way of educating the masses, even those who don't care, of its ingenuity.

Why would tensions in NK affect a cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:50:04
That's an absurd prediction. When all major businesses accept Bitcoin as a viable currency, it will no longer show the volatility it has today - and will stabilise (probably, in my eyes, at around $10k).
Also, if BTC reached 10 million USD, the dollar would no longer have any value.

I'm guessing this is sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:30:49
I believe BTC will hold itself around $3500 - $4000 until close to the end of September. I might be grossly wrong (which I hope I am), but I'd say now is the time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:01:13
Yes and no.
The idea of Bitcoin will outlive paper money. In the far future; all payments will probably be digitised. In fact, I don't see paper money surviving beyond 2100. Although by this point, the novelty of Bitcoin would've probably been lost.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:03:33
Essentially, BCH was created off the confusion around Aug 1. It attempted to catapult itself into a unique crypto off the success from Bitcoin.
BCH has no technological benefits.

Essentially, you're asking what to spend $200 on.
If I were you, I'd sell all your 0.065 btc and diversify your portfolio. Put some into eth, monero, lite etc.

That machine is one of the games :)
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:43:19
Fees are low in BCH because the 8 mb blocks can handle the traffic. BCH has far less transactions than BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:54:13
Don't buy until you see a slight uptrend. I'd give it a few more days; see how low it can go.

Didn't Bitcoin go bust in 2008 with Merill, Bear and Lehman?
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:22:22
If BCH had, theoretically, as many transactions as BTC - it would need a SegWit-esque event to increase its block size. 
Although, naturally, if BCH had more transactions - exchanges would probably charge more fees.

$4000 -&gt; $25,000 is not a 4000% increase...

If Bitcoin hits $100k, the USD would've probably lost all value. Today's  BTC wallet (with 108,404 BTC) would be worth $10 billion.

Was at an interview for Morgan Stanley a few months back. Didn't mention cryptos at all, as I was unsure of their stance on the entire concept. Told them I had a portfolio with 80% returns in a month. They just stared at me - as I'd literally outperformed 100% of hedge funds.
Naturally, I didn't get the job. They probably thought I was a dirty liar.

BTC has been around for about 7 years. Blockchain.info reports 16,870,000 wallets. I'm sure some of those must be physically dead. If they died between 2010-2012, their wallets were probably worth next to nothing at the time - meaning they didn't both to organise inheritance.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:32:43
Not at all. I believe in Bitcoin as an investment rather than an upcoming technology. That very idea would be looked down upon in this community.

Seeing the China uncertainty, I doubt $5k will be close. As much as I'd liked to be proven wrong, I don't see this for the next month. I think BTC could easily hold itself around $4200 - $4600.

You sound like quite a novice. There is **no such thing** as "get-rich quick" and nothing will appreciate indefinitely. You should never invest more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:31:43
I'd never risk that much as a father. Before investing, you've got to think of the lives that you'll impact. As an individual, you face all the responsibility that your losses bring. But as a family - you're bringing them all down with you. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:50:32
I don't think people realise the basic principles of buying a crypto. This drop is caused by people selling their BTC in bulk before SegWit. I'd probably do the same, if I were you.

In this last week, BTC has gone from a high of $2956.5 to a low of $2441.2. That's 17.5%. It might not fit your criterion, but it's pretty damn close.

Don't cash into BTC as of yet. BTC / USD was 2.7k yesterday, and is around 2.3k as of now. I'd let it ride a bit lower, as it might even sink below 2k. 
Instinctively, I temporarily cashed in my dozen-or-so bitcoin on Thursday!
