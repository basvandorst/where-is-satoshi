Why? We can already use cash AKA real money to buy whatever we want? There's no incentive to use bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:50:36
Who does this except criminals and man children who use the word "rape" in casual conversation?
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:01:28
Are you female 
@_date: 2014-01-16 07:49:04
Lol you're so mad 
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:02:03
What's that?
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:52:56
How's the oxycodone going?
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:34:17
Media outlets don't give a fuck about what a bunch of spergs think
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:46:41
Be your own bank! is a central mantra of bitcoin. I don't think you're quite ready for bitcoin..m
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:17:13
Hope everything is ok
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:07:47
You abandon the doge like so many abandoned dogs in Sochi. Shame on you, OP
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:14:27
Urban dictionary link? Manchild confirmed. Try dropping rape in casual conversation next time you speak to your mother.
@_date: 2014-01-20 04:26:04
People can get tipped every time they use a gender-nuetral pronoun? Fuck yes, time to end the reign of the cis lords
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:49:03
Why don't you just keep your coins and buy whatever you wanted with real money
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:42:01
Part of being your own bank is keeping your own transaction records... I don't think you're ready for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:02:31
This is how :) + $1000.00 verify
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:09:19
Its simple , just wait for the next block which is only 10 minutes minimum, sometimes triple that, really you should wait a few blocks worth so they don't double spend, so basically their drink will have evaporated by the time the transaction is processed.
But of course that's the best case scenario (paying fees)
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:56:45
Banks and credit cards offer protection and insurance. If your bitcoins are stolen you are fucked
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:04:57
I don't understand? How it better privacy when every single transaction is publicly viewable?
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:04:13
I like it when my girlfriend pegs me
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:32:19
Don't you mean "leave on an upvote"? Cause I just gave you one xD
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:21:25
Because I bought some. Durr.
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:53:30
Hmm and how long did it take to acquire your bitcoins in the first place? And how long to convert them back to USD so you can buy something other than FarmVille points? I can sign up for a gambling website whenever I want and start betting instantly using my credit card to deposit. Of course I don't, cause online betting is for degenerates.
Disingenuous argument ...
@_date: 2014-01-24 00:48:11
Yeah, because both are fictional creatures
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:32:51
Last guy I knew that took a trip to Belize never came back
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:24:59
Explain how am I wrong? The only reason its the biggest "supercomputer" (which can only do one thing and that one thing is pointless busywork to win the block lottery) is because of the bitcoin arms race. There's no reason it couldn't run off a CPU. You call me a troll and say I'm wrong but I don't think you understand difficulty and bitcoin in general...
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:42:47
When has that ever happened? Meanwhile bitcoins get stolen daily
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:31:03
This is an actually an embarrassing point about bitcoin because a single standard PC is powerful enough to secure the bitcoin network. You're just wasting power doing pointless busywork.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:04:10
Why is there a fee column, bitcoins don't need a transaction fee
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:15:09
Rude, I don't think she would appreciate that.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:21:58
Needs more Dogecoin
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:09:17
Go blue yourself
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:41:12
Why would a bitcoin ATM be free? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:38:56
I didn't make the analogy, idiot. I'm responding to it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:56:05
Whoa what just happened
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:30:01
pay o.ooo1 btc to read this news article!!! (In 3 days when the transaction confirms) 
U not very bright are u
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:44:55
Have you even looked how much is spent mining lmao 
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:02:50
Crude rape metaphors aside (what's wrong with you?) Google have had the wallet service for years now, its not a suprise
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:10:56
Gross, I'm.not into scat
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:14:26
Wow so percent such share
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:36:36
Thanks, I'm interested if this will be a viable withdrawal method. Mtgox has issues as we all know, and other impose long waiting periods and limits. Cheers.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:13:17
You sound mad. Are you mad OP?
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:21:06
trying to stop you giving away your "billion dollar idea" for free on the internet,, you dumb idiot
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:23:04
They also laughed at Bozo the clown
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:34:35
I would prefer a Doge cake
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:19:54
Fuckon hell, why are bitcoiners so obsessed with wikipedia. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:17:15
I thought transactions were free?
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:44:12
Tis amazing what one can purchase with the USD
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:29:13
Macs are quite vulnerable to attacks, especially when bitcoin is involved. I'd install linux if I were you.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:57:54
I just wanna get rich as fuck and be a captain of industry. I'm smarter than all these bankers so they don't stand a chance.
FREE MARKET, BITCH
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:11:39
Should we really be coddling along such weak-minded humans, Semen-Thrower? This is stupidm
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:05:28
Girl with blue hair - I wanna block on your chain if you catch my bitdrift
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:16:01
If you can't counter his arguments, doesn't that mean he's right? Sounds like basic common sense to me. You have conigitive dissonance because of the money you have invested
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:42:27
Free market, bitch 
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:14:41
Figurative or not it indicates your attitude towards bitcoin and your subsequent self loathing. Lmao
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:21:53
Fuck that is a good idea, scam bitcoiners out of 2.5k. Good luck
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:27:32
Ythink wikipedia accepting bitcoin will drive the price up, don't you
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:38:59
LOL $50 and an excel spreadsheet. Here's a life lesson, nobody freaking cares
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:08:19
What are you bringing to the table other than an idea? Absolutely nothing? Yeah, thanks for the idea idiot.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:36:40
BFL make some powerful miners
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:15:57
Suspect? Do you think they alterior motives?
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:11:33
Ah yes, explaining bitcoin to someone who doesn't speak English. I see this turning out fantastically.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:12:09
Taxes also pay for hospitals,schools, roads, garbage men you big fucking dumb man child
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:33:09
Salient commentary, PrincessChoadzilla
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:40:49
Because its the gold of the future? Pretty damn obvious LOL
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:59:29
Bitcoin: instant transfers, no fees!!
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:42:04
Ah yes, I too take important financial advice from anonymous posters on the "bodybuilding" internet message board *strokes goatee*
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:34:48
I doubt it. This place is filled with huge nerds yet everyday multiple people complain about losing all their BTC. If the nerds in this reddit still can't manage to secure their wallet, what hope does anyone else have?
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:34:20
Yeah, isn't that what I just said?
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:52:13
FEMALES; I will also touch your feet for bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:51:58
So you're saying there's two methods and neither of them work?
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:13:48
Yeah 5 billion third world people don't have access to download 12gb of blockchain you colossal autist
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:24:08
Haha good username
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:01:27
Read, comprehend, post. The most basic rules of the internet. Fuck off and practice 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:28:44
The explanation is that bitcoin is a prototype, not a finished cryptocurrency, and people just ran with it 
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:46:21
Atr your trying to make money or save the world cause you said bothe lol
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:04:19
This. Females don't care about this stuff
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:48:18
The protocol that can only handle 7 transactions per second, sounds pretty bad and unscalable to me.
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:08:04
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:11:50
Dogecoin wow. Such important. Very better than bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:31:53
Yep I'll do this,.
Can someone please write it though? I'm an ideas guy 
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:32:21
Psychological effect for morons, maybe. Seriously, you'd have to be borderline retarded to think it looks less volatile. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:45:39
Bitcoin poker exists and childporn for bitcoin is a real confirmed thing, so fail on both fronts
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:21:49
Not me. I'm an ideas guy, too
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:27:33
If the price of btcoin rises so does the fee
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:35:21
Beats me dude, I let the bank worry about the best way to secure my money.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:45:22
It doesn't sound as bad, to a mental midget. Why don't u move the decimal point so its only swinging 3 cents then?
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:17:37
Because if you don't, you're relying on a central authority. Yknow, a bank. Like cash. Which is already established. And doesn't have ridiculous technology limits.
How are they going to spend it ? Idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:53:09
I agree, bitcoin is AIDS
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:29:44
How can it be a joke when bitcoin isn't? Have you even read the DogePaper?
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:39:52
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:43:13
Bullshit. If you really wanted to donate to them, you'd do it through an available channel. You don't though, you just ask them to accept BTC. Face it, you just want them to accept it so the price goes up. If you want to prove me wrong, donate to them.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:55:38
Stocks give you dividends, and companies make money. Your analogy is terrible. You also imply that you're a chump and so is everyone else involved with bitcoin.
Hope u feel bad lmao idiot
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:19:06
Bitcoin; free transaction s LOL 
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:07:09
Give your fake money to a fake god

Banks are regulated and insured so no customers lose money.
USD users not affected... U mad sheep marketplace junkies??
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:16:26
Dogecoin only coin with upward market trend? Jealous much? Enjoy your dying coin lmao
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:15:28
That's stupid because if only one person mined on one PC it would.be enough to find blocks. It only costs so much because of difficulty
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:03:03
Have you made any withdrawals? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:29:48
LOL My dick is 8 inches, nerd
