I'd bet money you don't even know French, let alone live there.  You'll run your selective scam until the website gets shut down and you'll get a new domain and start again.  The authorities won't find you because your domain is registered anonymously with false information.

Tell it to the SEC.

So incorporate in a foreign country and get a foreign bank account and don't forget to pay your taxes.

That's not what peer-to-peer means.  
  
- here is another red flag for your list.

You shouldn't advertise how stupid you are to the whole world.

Of course, how are you going to get victims if you perform KYC before they are allowed to fund their account?  You aren't.  That's how the scam works and why you allowed anyone to create an account and fund it when you posted this advertisement.

That doesn't make it right.  But that's fine, language and definitions can be changed if enough people agree.
  
How come your website isn't available in French?  I would thing this would be easy for a "French family".
  
How come your centralized trading platform doesn't deal in Frances native currency?

You are not performing KYC\AML.  You imply you are complying with French law but you aren't.  When you posted this advertisement you were not restricting US IPs.  When I called you on it the several US IPs I tried were then magically restricted.
  
This looks like a selective scam to me.  How this works is that you post here with no restrictions hoping to lure in some victims and then if they happen to win on your platform and try to withdraw you lock them down and use whatever excuse you can to delay and not pay out.  We've seen this scam a lot over the years.

File a TCR with the SEC and let them sort it out.

Traceability on the blockchain isn't as simple as that.  And that still isn't an excuse for not complying with the law.

Showing me code in a pastebin is not proof that it is in production - it is not proof of anything.  If you complied with EU law then you would be requiring KYC before allowing someone to fund their account.
   
Even your legal page screams scam.  It is an image so there is no text that can be indexed.

How are you keeping US customers from using your platform?  As best I can tell, US IPs are not restricted.

The money likely originated from illicit funds that will eventually be removed from Zach's account leaving him on the hook for the money.  Meanwhile the thief has the Bitcoin that cannot be reversed.

It's fine as long you structure it correctly and pay your taxes on your income.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:38:40
They aren't doing business with "me".

Where is the source code so we can compile our own p2p client?
