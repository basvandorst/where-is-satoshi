Ehhh creepy, yeah. But guys that behave like that probably don't have much social intelligence, maybe the "forever alone" type. People do dumb things when in situations that are new to them and nervous. Perhaps if  you encounter those types encourage them to come out and be social instead of branding them with words like creepy which will make them feel more outcasted and avoid social activities out of their comfort zone.
Edit: Not to say this kind of thing should be tolerated or is acceptable but creepy guys with no social intelligence will only become more creepy the more outcasted they become.

I think we are making different points. You are saying in an ideal world he would distribute them so people can use them. I'm saying that this would have the same effect as deleting them. If he distributed them everyone would have more btc. If he deleted them in theory everyone's btc would be worth more. Which in terms of value is the exact same outcome. Whether or not the market would really react this way who knows.
If btc stabilized at $1k or $5 or $1 million it would indicate there ARE enough coins at that price. If there were not enough coints it would create more demand which would lead to value increasing not being stable.

Not OP but I can take a stab at why OP has this theory. If one mining operation has a lot of capital they could remain solvent even when bitcoin price is stuck at a low point. Some mining operations could be forced to shutdown if bitcoin remains at a low point for too long and they can no longer pay their bills.
I dont think this theory holds any water because it would likely take too long to pull off, bleeding money the whole way.

Hindsight is 20/20, being right about calling BS doesn't really matter unless you are consistently right, otherwise you are just calling black on roulette and saying "See I told you it was going to land on black, I was right!"
It could very well still be in a bubble, or it could be on the verge of a new bubble, or neither. I wish you the best of luck getting in at $200 and coming out ahead. 
I was never one of the ones saying its going to go to $10000000 any moment now. I believe bitcoin has potential to be something great long term and if that happens the price will be high enough that it doesn't really matter whether you got in at $200 or $600...just as long as you did get in. I'm not a day trader, I stick to buy and hold on investments I think have potential.
I also recognize that there are huge hurdles in the way that could send the price to zero or stagnate at a low amount indefinitely.
It's a risky investment and will continue to be so for a long time.

If you buy in a bubble(or anytime for that matter) you need to be ready to accept that you may be buying near the peak and may need to hold for a long time to be in the black again, if ever.

I'm perfectly ok with that also! The only problem I see is we would start getting really large numbers and people will use weird notation. like 100,000uB would be simpler to write as 100k uB (yes people will fuck that up instead of simply writing 100mBtc)
Ultimately  mBtc makes the most sense right now but in order to avoid switching to uBtc later and confusing the masses that cant comprehend those prefixes it may be better to go right to uBtc now.

In the long term I agree but the general public knows nothing about security. It would be sad but I wouldnt be surprised to see people jump onto a coin that is easier to use but not as secure. It would ultimately fail but if that were to happen it would hurt digital currency. Here's to hoping btc keeps on pushing forward and makes it way to a tech that anyone can use.

What if you got paid more than what it cost to run your computer. It seems doable. If google has a giant data center they need to pay for power, cooling, maintenance, cost of hardware etc. If all they need to do is compensate you for your power and a little extra I could see it working out cheaper.
@_date: 2014-01-21 19:22:54
Or create another coin that targets another demographic entirely. All the alt coins are going after the same tech, libertarian etc demographic. Create a coin that is super easy to use, maybe even technologically inferior to bitcoin and go for average joe or a religious sect who will follow along just because X person they believe in said to.
Don't think it will happen but if another coin achieved much higher adoption than bitcoin though other channel it could steal its thunder.

While I would generally agree that scale allows for great efficiency I could still see this working out cheaper. The real question would be what % of googles overhead server overheard goes towards power cost. It could still be cheaper to only have to pay enough to cover the electricity + a little gravy on top to make it worth the users while.
Obviously it wouldn't be worth it to go out and buy hardware to try to compete with google but if its hardware you already have that is sitting idle then the only cost is electricity(and added wear and tear but I doubt many consumers will think about that)
I don't know enough to say if it would be feasible but it would be really cool to see the numbers.

I've been involved in btc for quite some time so I'm absolutely positive :)
Funds were sent to pay for a product via coinbase from my e wallet which were then immediately auto refunded due to an error. The message specified they were sent back to the address they came from which is not an address I controll due to the nature of shared wallets. The shared wallet admin should control this address so I'm hoping they can make things right but as someone else said this should not be the job of the shared wallet. It's coinbase's fault for sending it to an address without user approval first.
It is very common for people to use shared wallets so to send it back to the address it was sent from without approval is ridiculous and bound to cause many problems.

This is exactly what I was trying to get at. I dont want to see another paypal/visa etc network spring up and put us back where we are now(for the mainstream, tech users could use btc as it is now I suppose) Really hoping to see some outside the box thinking on how to solve problems like these in innovative ways.
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:49:32
The thing that sparked the idea originally is I like to try new and unique recipes and sometimes they call for ingredients I don't often use. For instance my girlfriend wanted to make German chocolate cake from scratch. It required cocoa powder and a couple other things I rarely use so they will sit in my kitchen taking up space not being used and possibly go bad or just not fresh anymore. Some specialty ingredients can also be very expensive in small quantities at the store but significantly cheaper in bulk. Making that Indian curry dish could mean looking all over for the proper ingredients and paying a pretty penny for it not to mention having to buy more than I actually need for the dish.
Once I thought of the idea I thought of all the other uses of the service; Lazy people with a refined taste that prefer the convenience of cake mix in a box but the taste of home made cake with quality ingredients, those that don't cook often and have a poorly stocked kitchen, gifts for family and friends like favorite cookie recipe in a jar. It allows for the simplicity of store bought mixes in a box with more variety and control of what goes into it.
TL;DR Sorry for the ramble but what I'm trying to get at is most perishables like eggs and milk people will already have in their fridge or can be picked up at any store and are more likely to be used.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:36:44
Almost every time I've made a btc payment via QR it has all been automatic. Couldnt ask for simpler than that.

Agreed, though I still think electrum is much simpler to setup for someone just dipping their feet into the water. I'd rather them get in easy and learn as they go instead of start with a higher learning curve.
Gotta say though I much prefer btc over credit card. I find much faster to scan a QR code than type in my CC info and no risk of extra charges which can be a HUGE pain to resolve with the CC company. Cant wait for the day that's the norm.

Honestly you'd probably be a lot better off just selling it yourself on craiglists(since its in good condition) as that is what I do with them once I've fixed them so if you skipped the middle man you'd get a good bit more for it. But if you just want a simple transaction you'd get $80 for it.

I would think that since it is instant that if I send 182btc from wallet A through blocks chains service to wallet B that you could simply search for a transaction made for 182btc- .5% fee around the same time and then know that those btc almost certainly came from wallet A.

Just had a similar problem paying for something with coinbase and a shared wallet. I sent too much so they auto refunded the whole thing. Now I have to see if I can somehow get it credited back to my account. So far coinbase has not replied to my email about it. It's a huge flaw in the way they handle bitcoin. They MUST ask you to specify a refund address before sending it off into oblivion.

Nothing happens, if that's where bitcoin ends up thats the end game. It's still useful for those who value it but that will be a limited number of people. 
I'm a long term holder personally but if bitcoin gets pushed further back into fringe and stays there then it wont be nearly as useful to me then as it is now or what I hope it will evolve into. I would eventually lose interest in btc.

I'm with icegoat on this. Basically we had an idea but neither of us knew how to actually bring it to life so we got a friend who is going to school for CS to help. But its stretched out for well over a year as he works on it as he has time and still has to learn a lot as he goes.
We have the money to get it done professionally but its a bit of a challenge of I don't even know how to go about getting it done professionally. How much to expect to pay, how to define what we need done etc.
We already have a pcb layout that should be pretty close to what we need in the end and prototypes of said pcb. We also have the bulk of the code done but there are a lot of bug and some features that just do not work at all. Our friend is still working on fixing them but we'd just like to get it done right and in  timely manner.
I'd like to think that most of the code can be re-used but for all we know he did a poor job coding it and it should be done over.

With this logic you should not spend any money including fiat. Every fiat dollar you spend is opportunity cost. Whether I spend $1 usd or $1 worth of btc its $1 I could have converted to btc or kept in btc.

Many shared wallets send from an address you do not control. 
There is an extremely simple solution. Instead of auto refunding open a dialog box first "These coins will be refunded to address X, is this ok, if not please specify refund address" This is so obvious I have no clue how they are not doing it.

There is not a direct dollar for dollar correlation between the price of btc and amount of USD spent on purchasing btc. If a user bought $1million worth of btc it would likely raise the "market cap" much more than 1 million. 
Though I do agree that users have an incentive to get others to join its not such a simple relationship.

We seem to have both had the same thought at nearly the same time ;)
But yes there will definitely need to be a change in the ways  fees work to provide more incentive for miners to secure the network as block rewards go to zero. Perhaps a formula for fees could come into play so small transactions ($5 etc) are still only a couple cents but a $1000 transaction could have say a .50 cent fee. This would increase the total reward for miners while still keep fees reasonable.

Thats a shame but it beats making promises and failing to meet them. Really hope it all works out. Is there any other hardware(usb even) device that stores private keys and signs transactions. Offline wallets are a pain :/

Sounds about right. I'd much prefer to get important messages via Dungeon masters on bike than electronically. Coinbase get on this now!!!

I suppose there would also be those that would mine just for the sake of securing the network and keeping the freedom of bitcoin alive.
Though you would not get clean coins once there is no longer a block reward (fees would not be clean afaik)

This is one of the issues. Currently light clients are a solution and what I personally use so I dont need to download the whole block chain. I've heard talks about pruning old transactions and such also. Disk size also gets bigger and cheaper every year.

Are there any wallets that use 2FA other than web wallets? I'd love to have a wallet on my computer with 2FA but have yet to hear of any.

They were not diluted and in theory the value did not change but it still supply and demand still drastically affects selling price. If a new car is worth 20k and dealers are selling for 20k and then the manfufacuer comes along selling them for 10k its going to drive the price peopole are willing to pay down. Sure the car may still be worth 20k but nobody is going to pay it. I'm not sure if this analogy is technically on point as I do not know a ton about stock exchange but this is the effect I just saw in the exchanges. 
So although it may have been a "Gift to anyone who knows the the true value" it still created a lot of panic and upset the market which was still detrimental to your current investors.

I wonder why walmart allows it but many other stores cracked down on it. Old posts on forums seemed to indicate most stores allowed you to buy giftcards with store cards but it seems walmart is one of the only ones that still allows for it. Great find either way! Any idea if you can do the same thing at walmart.com?

I believe it also includes people just moving money around from their own wallets. I could move $100million from one wallet of mine to the other and that would count I believe.
 
PS can I have 100 million worth of btc please.
@_date: 2013-11-15 08:34:52
200 billion is peanuts if they were keeping all the money they created as profits. Any credit card is backed by a bank which lends money to the cardholder temporarily. This would mean every credit card purchase, every house loan, every auto loan, ever business loan, every loan PERIOD would be free money created out of thin air and kept by the banks as profit if repaid. Without even doing the math that's a HELL of a lot more than 200 billion.

If you let me know whats wrong with it and how many GB I can definitely give you at least something for it( I mean its only a few clicks to send btc :D )
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:13:46
An FYI for anyone using their site. They often have target cards that are for use only online. But if you download the target app you can load them onto your phone and use them in store. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 20:43:58
I know at least bitpay has the option to have USD deposited into a bank account so the merchant can accept btc but never actually touch it. Just as easy as PayPal in that case.
For businesses that want to keep the btc and not exchange for USD it cant be to hard to automate something to send coins from the processor to cold storage if its not already being done.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:46:04
To be fair they have sent some random gift cards to me since signing up, they just weren't of any use to me.
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:53:48
I'm not familiar with your site but having seen so many other bitcoin business not handle situations like this properly I'd like to thank you for having an alarm to alert you even at an inconvenient time like being asleep, making a statement right away to let uses know whats going on and working towards resolving it as fast as possible.
Other sites could learn from this.
@_date: 2013-02-07 21:46:37

I own a business repairing iPods and iPhones out of my house. I could easily take a month+ off without a huge impact to my business other than lost profits.
I'm 24 with no real obligations short of rent and a girlfriend
Fuel will be one of the hardest parts. But you can buy walmart giftcards with egifter and it's been said you can use a walmart gift card to buy other giftcards. I need to test this out but this may mean I could easily just buy walmart cards and then shell cards. I may also try to get the bitcoiners I meetup with to put gas in my tank in exchange for bitcoins.
I haven't thought of the budget much yet. I did a road trip 1.5 years ago from Oregon to Vegas and back and there were many unexpected costs ( our van's engine seized up and we had to buy a whole new van to continue the trip) A pretty big chunk of coins would have to be allotted to ensure the cross country trip was a success.
I suppose I could even bring the tools and parts needed to do common repairs with me on the trip to make some money along the way.

@_date: 2013-11-05 06:24:58
Yep 3 months without a hitch. They made a post on here a while back and that's when I jumped on board. They use coinbase to convert to usd. There is a fee but for me its worth the convenience.
@_date: 2013-05-14 04:17:20
Most definitely. I wasn't too worried about the problems with the orders. It's when they stop replying to emails that I start worrying. And if they really did delete my post in their sub that's also very concerning. Problems can be worked out and stream lined but censoring bad reviews and not communicating is no good at all.
@_date: 2013-01-10 00:12:45
worisome that as bitcoin currently is it cant handle anywhere near this many transactions per day and my understanding is it will require a fork to fix this.
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:41:19
If someone is tech savvy enough to see a paper wallet and know what it is then they could probably also run simple password cracking software that would chew right through a simple password. It seems like a false sense of added security.

I think he is thinking of currency exchange not a stock exchange.
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:22:52
email I received from them after following up on my previous email from a few weeks ago that indicated they were considering it.
@_date: 2013-10-02 02:44:07
They also offer some cool discounts. I got a 10% off $100 code and a few other special offers that make them a better deal than gyft and even a better deal than simply cashing out btc for your purchase. If only they had Amazon.
@_date: 2013-02-19 09:48:28
It's all perception. If you are currently buying songs from them and stop buying songs because you can get it free then they are making less money  than before directly because their songs are availnble to you free. Free it awesome, and often pirating is faster and easier than buying. If you lose your job most people would consider than negative, so lets stick with negative on lost dollars.
@_date: 2013-02-07 22:20:13
Thanks! That actually sounds like a really easy way to get an offline bitcoin key! I'll definitely use it for her and in the future for myself when I need another address.

If its in good working condition you're probably best off just listing it on craiglists since thats where the once I fix go in the end and you can skip the middle man. But let me know if its ATT or verizon if you want to get it off your hands quickly.

Costo cards or gas cards please!
@_date: 2013-02-05 05:42:07
prices vary quite a bit based on how salvageable it is. I dont buy a ton of them, normally I just offer to buy a device off a customer if they dont want to bother repairing it or if its beyond repair.
But for an example yesterday I paid $50 for a verizon iPhone 4 16gb with cracked screen and back plate.
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:24:31
Just shoot them an email. I didnt create an account or anything, just emailed them.
@_date: 2013-02-22 21:39:17
I emailed them about taking bitcoins a week or so ago and this was the responce I got(I really do love how personal dreamhost is in their customer support)
Actually, we HAVE given thought to accepting bitcoins as payment! We're
looking into whether or not it would be possible, feasible, the pros and
cons of accepting them, etc. Rest assured that it is definitely being
considered, and we'd love to do this if at all possible, though right now
I can't say for sure if we will or won't be accepting them in the future!
Sorry to give you a noncommittal answer, but we just aren't at a
conclusion yet :) If you have any other questions just let me know!
Jeremy T
And a follow up email
I actually don't know if we have a company Reddit account. I'm sure our
Social Media team will jump on it if they haven't already! Pretty much
half the people here are Redditors.
I've sent your email to the company, to see if we can get the Bitcoin pot
stirred up again. I'm sure this is still something management talks about
often. If we start it, make sure you pass the word along for us!
Let me know if you have any questions!

Possibly quite a lot faster. if btc grew by 150x it would still be tiny and have much more room to grow. Throw in sites like satoshi dice that can inflate the number of transactions. If it requires a hard fork in the software  it seems like something that should be done now rather than cause more issues in the future when more people will be watching.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:32:03
With all this talk about taxes and such, is there a list of CPA, Tax Attorneys etc who are knowledgeable in btc or even take btc as payment?

I remember opening up a pack on the ride home as a kid and looking at all of them in the dark trying to see what they were. Then I saw the hologram and I couldn't tell what it was immediately until CHARIZARDDDDD Happiest day of my little kid life. Bitcoin brings that same excitement :)
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:27:26
Great point! Still would make sense to use at least a decent password, one that would take a bit of time to crack so you have that window of time to move the funds before they crack it.
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:37:41
Wellll since you're here. I'd like to be able to sort by % discount. I tend to go for cards that have a good % off and it would make skimming the site easy.

@_date: 2013-11-03 00:44:22
Have you confirmed this in store? I read that both target and k-mart would allow you to buy giftcards with their store cards but both refused when I tried.
@_date: 2013-03-11 05:20:51
Yea I cant ever see that happening. People gravitate towards greater convenience and that would be a huge headache especially compared to the cash or credit cards.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:32:38
I'm well aware that this could have been avoided by not using a shared Wallet. This does not make what coinbase is doing any less wrong. I am just some guy, what I do with my btc is my own responsibility. They are a big player with a reputation at stake and the problems they are causing are simple to avoid.
What they are doing is like sending you a cash refund in the mail without confirming you have not moved yet.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:23:39
So like stock? Or the sale of anything with a changing market value?
@_date: 2013-11-15 08:00:05
If this were the case the banks would be MUCH more powerful than they already are and inflation would be enormously higher.
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:55:45
I like what you guys are doing but this alone is reason not to invest. You changed your plans in under a day of announcing them which seems to indicate you are not receiving the proper legal counsel before trying to find investors.
An idea for a business is not worth much, its the implementation that matters and to not figure out the legal implications ahead of time is sloppy. 
I wish you the best of luck though, we need many more of these ATM's I just wish the legality of them was not so complicated.
@_date: 2013-01-10 03:17:03
wow that is quite an obvious solution :P covers both starting anew business and expanding into  a well known name giving the customers the option to pay less because they trust the site.
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:57:59
Also would love to buy one but can anyone vet you? I've already lost some btc in the past to a new site which seemed legit enough so I gave them the benefit of doubt. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:00:58
