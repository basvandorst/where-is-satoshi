The power of crypto currency is 1. decentralisation 2. lower fees 3. less government control
All these three in the long run lead to a stronger consumer base. At the same time it threatens both companies and governments by taking away some of their power and margins.

Absolutely. It is volatile now, as it is still a very new technology. It will stabilize and the road there might be rocky.
There will be several different crypto currencies, platforms, use cases etc. However, looking at fiat currency as well as for example gold there will probably be ONE dominant store of value.  Right now it looks like bitcoin will be that store of value in the crypto world. If this is true bitcoin might go to 200k USD per bitcoin, though it might take 5-10 years.

Bitcoin will be a store of value in the future. Not a payment method with low transaction cost. There are other cryptos for that.
tldr: these news do not really affect the core capability of bitcoin which is store of value, similar to gold.

Agree with that. At the same time Bitcoin is not dependent on one country or one government. If it is forbidden in one, it might become more popular in another. Its a very interesting development to follow.

Only 1 in maybe 1000 have any deep knowledge of crypto currencies yet. Thus I believe this type of measurement is too early.

Bitcoin is now in a bubble pattern (current phase bulltrap). Thus i believe you are totally right to sell. The next phase could be the ”panic phase”
Wait for a sharp downturn or stabilizaton above 18k before buying again.
I am bullish on bitcoin long term but the chart looks terrible now. ��

You have a point

Gold is similar  to bitcoin. The value of every single crypto currency is decided by what the next person is willing to pay for it. Gold is exactly the same.
Gold has been a holder of value since roman ages, and is considered rare. Bitcoin is the most widespread crypto and is considered rare and valueable by &gt;100x more ppl than the second crypto.
This means bitcoin will never lose all its value, just like gold. It could go to 1—3k usd at some point but i consider lower almost impossible, since its a household name. Gold could go to 500 usd per oz, but probably not lower for the exact same reason.

I like this one the most of all suggestions

Interesting, highly decentralised which gives further confidence from the investment community.

It will just continue I believe. The reason is that Bitcoin is seen as an alternative to gold.
There is only a limited amount, and it will always be worth a lot of money.
