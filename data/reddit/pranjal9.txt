Please post this in r/btc too
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:16:14
So...How about LTC? fast, cheap, reliable, has segwit and will have LN soon...And atomic swaps with BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:35:36
Better than BCH
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:21
Read, learn and then invest...ONLY WHAT YOU CAN LOOSE. Also, no one knows if it will go up or down. Consider others too...ETH, LTC, POWR, etc...
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:50:55
Its ridiculous to bring religion into this...But then... ��
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:40:19
Yes, for now...Might change after LN, RSK etc come in full effect. Even then it might be more of a gold...For investment, and LTC for spending as currency...It will always be cheaper and faster, likely.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:07
From BCash team...wallstreet people do not work after 5pm ��. Also, buy the dip if you can. HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:18:48
BCash is attacking BTC since before it's launch (never heard from them about coexisting). It is currently looking better due to block size...But that's not the only solution. You should not stick to 1 and should diversify the portfolio...Always. core team is.aware of the issues and are working on it. Projects on the way, LN testing earlier than schedule. Have faith and patience. 
Also if BTC becomes as popular as it's expected...This will continue to remain a problem for long. I for one believe it to be digital gold...And use LTC for other stuff. Even with current trafic volume, it's superfast and cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:22:30
Make sure you declare your gains and pay taxes on it ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:43:15
I don't think anyone here is stating that. Just that the expectation of BTC shooting further up did not get filled with CME launch, as was the speculation...That, in the setting of Alts going up.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:20:50
Right now, notHing is properly framed from law perspective. Declare gains as your income and pay as such. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:24:45
Just yest transferred from exchange to wallet after purchase. Got within few seconds. Minimal fee. LTC rocks
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:25:49
For US. Can try but Bharat ghas not declared it's status yet. Can try
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:58:34
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:10:58
Only id spamming would stop...Or companies adopt segwit...But we know the answers to that
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:00:29
Always up. The only 2 possible parties that might short BTC are whales or miners...But not sure if they will be a majority players in this market.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:17:38
Verify from coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:57:27
Yes it did... Expected a bigger impact this time as CME is huge compared to CBOE. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:54:28
True...Guess I have become too much used to seeing how fast paced things are in crypto world...Expected same in this scenario too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:04
Whales taking profit...That might include exchanges themselves too
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:48:42
I thought they demanded while in BTC and 250K as initial token...Good then
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:18:16
Any idea why LTC continues to remain so undervalued?  Agreed that it got major boost this year but still it should be minimum 1/10 of BTC if not 1/4 or 1/8 (considering BCC)
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:53:40
Coinbase has expressed it's support...Will see if ledger will credit too...Will keep my small BTC in ledger then and not move to a hot wallet
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:58:13
Yup...Not counting but hoping for it
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:40:20
Am new...Should I invest some now ir wait for it to retrace a bit...
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:25:05
I am planning to switch for same reason...Also it takes a week for a buy to get into account
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:44:00
I am new...Had joined the other too...Left it in few days because of all the negativity there... Literally all posts are about degrading BTC and may be less than 1% of all comments talk about benefits of BCH. It's basically how to destroy BTC. felt sick.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:30:30
Agree the trend came before HBO hacking..Iam just thinking if they are looking for 7.5 million in BTC...Placing some orders should have some impact on price
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:30:07
How far is this sustainable? 
Expecting a correction soon?
Is HBO hacking the cause?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:19:55
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:06:20
Thanks ��
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:00:38
Do you want to use your bit coin for payment now...Or stash it for use later when it's worth is more...? It can be used...Personal choice.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:32:30
7.5 mn is a good amount to drive some of price I think �� again not an expert..Just speculation
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:29:10
It's like digital gold...As I understand..You don't use it for day to day trading....LTC is good for that at the moment w less fee which is a concern w BTC...I am not an expert though...
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:03:21
Hoping that...Once BCH is dumped...Demand for BTC will Decline a bit
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:30:18
Hopefully not before me or you...
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:25:48
Thanks though
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:22:14
Not new...News but was hoping it will be avoided...
Does it mean that it will be same scenario as BCC and we will get credited with equal amount of BTC2x now?
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:02:20
I know...But really afraid to loose all crypto instead. Any better suggestions?
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:43:14
The way price is going up since yesterday...Smells fishy...
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:54:40
If you want melodious tunes...Try listening to Lata Mangeshkar or Kishor Kumar (old song with soulful voice and meaningful lyrics) or Shreya Ghoshal or Sonu Nigam (newer songs) 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:24:03
Thanks...Still trying to get hold of all these technicalities. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:53:34
I think November. Not sure if the timeline has changed
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:34:33
That's why I think it might come down...
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:55:16
Does anyone think it is time to switch to LTC temporarily given its stability and expected correction that can happen in BTC anytime now given the rapid rise?
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:33:57
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:52:07
So likely a correction will come soon as this is unrealistic?
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:45:00
Here is a thought...HBO hackers demand BTC...Orders placed and with demand price goes high...Hackers sell their btc to HBO to get BTC back as ransom... ��
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:07:17
Same here
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:17:46
Will look into it ��
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:25:33
I agree...Made the mistake. Now regretting as will have to move all crypto...Not too much bitcoin but all I have is in there 
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:43:56
That's what I'm hoping
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:55:19
Ok I understand that BCH is overvalued...But if you think BTC is not and LTC is, then please explain why
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:03:59
Seems like some big names want it to drop so that they can buy into it when it's low because they should have buyed it sooner and now did regret their  traditional thinking
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:26:53
I am not even thinking about it for long term...Just that LTC has been stable and BTC volatile...So switch to LTC and when BTC drops, go back again...
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:45:26
Which exchange do you use...Coin base would charge fee so high that there would be no profit
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:54:11
I think swap with LTC is coming on too...Low fee and fast transactions for daily uses...Am I right?
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:49:12
I will move to coinbase after few days and then try to upgrade...
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:58:18
I think a bit...but it might be 5K then and dip to 4.5...you never know. Personally, the way all major currencies have gone up in last 2 days is likely people exchanging BCH for others including BTC...should correct shortly, at least a bit. You never know though.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:40:44
I don't have much income...So file my own taxes. If you are in US, it's dam easy if all your spice of income is a job. 
You increase holdings by selling at higher prices and purchasing low...How I plan to do it? Please refer to the title and content of the post. 
Am 30+ and yes this is my first. Into this space for just few months and learning. Therefore looking for guidance. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:39:02
Yup... Desperately waiting for long overdue correction but it's still eluding ��
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:48:51
I am out of town...Can't even sell...Hope to get home in 10 hrs, transfer from ledger, sell and then wait for correction.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:19:20
I really hope so...Took lot of guts to do this...If it doesn't, am gonna hear about this from my wife...For a long time ��
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:25:29
No one...If they do, it will immediately mean they need democracy...And 'murika will be there to make sure they get it...
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:22:19
Am planning to declare it as capital gains. So far all the tax people I have asked...They have not dealt with it and don't know. Searching. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:44:22
Ya...Hoping it to drop more so that I can buy the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:33:53
Yes, I was thinking India. Not as much but there is some difference
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:03:21
The force is strong with this one...as I finally decided to move ALL my life savings in it...and that's not much but a lot for me...down by $160 now...been 45 mins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:20:05
I don't have much (&lt;1). 
But planning to sell for profit and increase holdings in this fashion.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:00:32
Yup...My hope...Koreans and Japan. Not sure about china that much although they do have some market. Got into LTC...But it does not suit me I think...Always purchased at...55 in July, then 96 at eat in Sept. Today at 54.3 ��
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:30:14
Yup...Based on my earnings, I predicted how much I can bet in next 5 yrs...I am already in with all that amount...Sort of playing with futures here already ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:43:18
WTF...it's really happening! already down by $130...minutes after purchase. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:08:49
Because if I sell it and don't declare, then its tax evasion in US. IRS is already digging for this. Regardless of wether I feel it is right or not...I don't want them standing on my door knocking. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:00:11
Nope hodl
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:15:28
Nope...I literally meant it...ALL IN ��
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:05:07
Mind telling why the down votes...? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:05:52
Great...Means we have time for correction. Only if tether (or whoever) is manipulating it would stop for a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:14:01
Bitcoin dot-com is marketing itself nicely. Presenting latest news...Articles written in BCH favor. This needs more marketing than anything else. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:59:25
Kyu bhai...Sach nahi hai kya?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:44:51
At 206 here...Newbie mistakes.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:09:29
Hey...Its soon going to be heating homes in Serbia...Maybe other places too...
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:18:57
With current fee... Would prefer LTC and just hodl btc with life
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:41:54
Yup...Concerned about hashpower and miner support...If they don't run core node...The chain can literally die
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:24:00
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:12:22
Because...I want to get some profit and reinvest to increase my BTC...Late to the party and not a good trader...Need to rely on corrections to increase my BTC. Can't just keep putting all my savings into it. Already in  deep
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:40:07
Hey, I could not post the title involving seg2x...Said it's an altcoin post and does not belong here...And it just inquired the timing so dat I can dump it before it falls. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:56:45
I am hoping it to hurt real bad ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:40:05
It seems like the dip will give me a stroke...Down by $400 so soon...Was it just waiting for me to buy?
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:08:20
Any idea how to claim bitcoin gold?Is ledger or coinbase giving them to customers?
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:00:45
How about bitcoin gold fork...Anyone cares about it ����
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:28:22
And the price did not budge !!!
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:18:59
I want to transfer my BTC from legacy chain to segwit...Any idea how much fee I should pay for this? I can customize it but don't want to be taking days. Is there a minimum fee suggested for legacy transactions?
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:03:47
Thanks. Planning to. Not sure if ledger will hoNor that as it's fork after forks...
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:40:28
Nd you can repost it again...
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:17:11
Thanks...Will need help and guidance after fork for it...Will post again after fork for that. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:16:13
That's how it should be...
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:02:24
Will watch after work. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:50:44
It's clear...he did not want to comment openly but in the end profit is what matters for miners...
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:29:51
If you have an account on coinbase, you have it on GDAX also...Transfer funds there and purchase. Avoid inflated prices at coinbase and no high fee on top...If tou got it at 4400 rate, effective price was likely 4550...
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:52:45
Thanks. Helpful �� I do have the seed safe with me (24 word passphrase I hope). 
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:11:49
Before you lol so hard that you pee in your pants...Read again. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:29:34
So, can I move BTC from legacy to segwit at 5 satoshi/byte or is there is a miniMum charge for old version?
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:46:54
His last name is dEmon with an "I"
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:09:47
Thanks. That helps. I have ledger. It gives an option to move BTC from old version to new segwit address. Was not sure if there was a need to do that. If I do, then what will be the miNimum fee I could get it done with?
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:33:06
Noob ? Here...If I still keep my coins in legacy chain...When 2x happens, will I still get chance to move them to segwit chain and get equal mount on 2x?
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:21:15
Buddy I had asked the ? Because of the fee requirements. Was worried if the transfer might fail since fee were high a few days back and was not sure if to do a transfer from legacy chain, a miniMum fee is needed or Not. Thanks for the explanation though. ��
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:13:03
The ? Was about the fee. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:07:18
Wish I had so much...You can only go up so much with little investment when you get in at 4K
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:07:33
All these forks will dilute BTC ultimately, look at the futures, S2X is at about 1100 and BTC at 3200 already... Significant drop coming.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:51:48
I believe this is the complete sentence. Rest all in between is just crap... ������
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:01:46
Thanks. Very Helpful ��
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:38:26
Thanks for the advice...You wont believe me when I tell you this but...I don't know how to identify it or use a private key (I know it's 51 character key but where can I find it?) to claim forked coin. Got into this on my brother's advice couple months back. So far I purchased some from coinbase and moved to my ledger. Keep on going through the forums to get some knowledge. All I have kept safe is the code to access ledger wallet. I understand it has my private key...But where? ��
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:17:43
If I have BTC legacy and BTC Segwit during fork...I get equal amount of 2x for both....Right? Am keeping in ledger for now. 
Not sure how to export keys to get Bitcoin gold though. 
Also hoping ledger will hoNor and guidance e 2x like it did w BCH.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:12:46
Should I wait till Aug 2nd or get some more now...Expecting BTC to the moon soon
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:46:10
Will i have to re-enter the security 24 word phrase after i upgrade my ledger?
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:12:00
Thanks...I tried restoring once and could not. So afraid
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:09:46
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:02:05
Which version did you have before the update? Heard after 1.3 we do not need to put in the phrase...
