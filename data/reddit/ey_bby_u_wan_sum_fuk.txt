It would require hardcoding an address in which would break the decentralised model.  Also, whoever controlled the receiving address would have the ability to create highly trusted accounts for free by 'burning' money and then giving it back to themselves.
It could also cause suspicion towards the project in general.  One of the great things about open source software is that it's generally built with the aim of *making great software*.  Lots of for profit software is intentionally crippled in order to suit a particular revenue model.  If the dev team is profiting off the reputation burn feature, it creates a conflict of interest.  They will have an incentive to make it a central part of the reputation system, rather than other, perhaps technically superior methods.

Sounds like an interesting thesis!
I feel like there's a general trend happening with technology decentralising, distributing, or shifting a lot of things.  That sounds really vague. I guess the internet is a good example though.  It allows people to communicate, discuss, publish, without having to go through local institutions. Bitcoin is a part of this trend. We take it for granted that we can communicate freely.  Even if one travels to China - simply use a VPN.  Now, we can transfer value in the same fashion, independent of location.  In future, we might see the communications infrastructure becoming decentralised, with networking protocols that take crypto payment in exchange for transferring data?  In the far future - quantum entanglement data teleportation might remove the need to physically transport signals across borders!
All this allows people to circumvent traditional 'choke points' which can be used by authorities to wield influence.  Governments are essentially location based entities, in a world where location is becoming less relevant.  Is this good? I don't know.  Governments are certainly useful.  But they might need to change their business model.

This is fantastic.  I'm in Australia and have used them several times.  Most of the stuff I buy in the US, I pay for with Bitcoin; newegg, frozenCPU, bitcoinstore, Amazon/Gyft.  Shipito was the only company I still needed a credit card for.

The questions seemed like they were designed to compare *Company vs. Company*.  When actually it's *Decentralised technology vs. Company*.  To a large extent, that *is* the advantage of bitcoin.
They need to ask questions like this:
Gives me complete control over my funds:
Paypal: NO
Bitcoin: YES
Allows me to send money to anyone, regardless of governmental approval?
Paypal: NO
Bitcoin: YES
Requires me to supply identifying information?
Paypal: YES
Bitcoin: NO

It's going to be interesting when they start paying each other in Bitcoin.  Presumably Dell buys licenses from MS...

Does anyone know why companies often start accepting Bitcoin for domestic customers only?

You should make one that sends money away every time you hit the snooze button.

you can ship to other countries through a remailer.  I've used shipito.com before (they accept bitcoin too)
