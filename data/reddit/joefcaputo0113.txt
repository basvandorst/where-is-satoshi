Also for those of us who "referred a friend" on Coinbase and got the free $10 referral in BTC.

Thanks man, have a great day.. 1 hour till futures go live! May the HODL be with you
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:46:42
That worked out nice :D 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:07:15
Jesus Christ...

Curious.... Where'd ya get it from, AMZN or Nano Ledger official website? I'm thinking of gifting myself one for Xmas, wanna know which is fastest to arrive. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:26:15
Yep I actually always do this. Send ~$10 first to make sure.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:09:06
Start by searching which wallets were readily available (and popular) at that point in time... Go from there. Search emails (if you still even have em), and also you would have to remember your password (or pass phrase, if you are now using a different a different device)... So good luck man.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:20:59
You are a HUGEEEEEEEEE dumbass to send via CB when you could've sent from Gdax for free... Jeez -__- 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:10:02
GDax without question! Limit orders, stop los + no fees. Easily GDax.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:38:59
Can you be my secret santa ?!?!
You're seriously the man for doing this. And yes, you can do this, just make sure you write down the pass phrase + pin and give it to him.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:29:24
The fact that you actually paid the fee without googling first makes you the dumbass. I linked you a search that took me 5 seconds to find your solution.. -__-
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:41:44
Great job copy/pasting this joke from Twitter (or wherever you found it) except completely fucking butchering it. Grade A Shitpost.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:36:33
I was gonna say mouse (which is also in the original rhyme).... But that wouldn't of made any sense haha. 
EDIT: I changed it, just for you bud.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:15:25
Gdax+Nano Ledger S (or Exodus if you don't feel like paying for a wallet).
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:31:31
Mistake  was using the app. Always use a desktop/PC when transferring from my experience.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:11:04
Pics or it didn't happen...
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:40:43
I'm guessing only 10min delay, unless you subscribe to live prices.

Use my special set of skills to find Satoshi and have him liquidate his cache of 1mln BTC at $1.

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:08:10
Dang man... I definitively should've included something with risk management and margin. Great point :/
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:09:42
Not sure how you are soo damn oblivious, but I hope you have a lesson learned here.. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:05:28
They have been calling a stock market crash/bubble for *years* now. When/if it does crash or go into a bear market, they will say "I told you so" even though they were **years** off. Their articles are trash and so is the "info" in them.

Who browses reddit while taking a dump AND check btc prices?
*Raises hand...*
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:43:50
Lol, anyone who actually reads or visits ZeroHedge, RIP to your IQ.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:25:17
Maybe OP should legit just do one quick [Google search]( instead of blindly sending his money, then complaining after...
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:16:45
Is this like the price is right? I'll go $1 please Bob.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:15:07
You're the real MVP.
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:02:16
They need my ID for "verification"... NO THANKS! Big red flag IMHO.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:45:50
Idiot LOL. His next question: Why is my account value going down when BTC is going down?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:03:59
I would have 5 ppl next to me, making sure I wasn't seeing things; all of us verifying every single fucking letter/number. This smells of pure bulllllshit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:02:31
So, where is the actual PROOF of this? This reeks of the OP trying to sound like a good guy, and suckering ppl in to donating to him for "being a good person".
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:57:09
Lol.... Idiot. This is why dumb money shouldn't invest. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:07:03
 
Read that.
@_date: 2018-06-10 15:52:27
Zerohedge is equivalent to CNBC Fast Money Twitter account. Complete trash. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 11:28:09
Thanks a lot! One thing: what does "custodioal" mean? 
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:45:38
It seems I posted this an hour or so too early...! 
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:32:22
Seems Eclair is the best, IMO, thanks! Just gotta wait for the upgrade to Lightning to be able to send out. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 15:35:47
Is Samourai open source? I was under the impression that it is not...?
@_date: 2019-02-24 00:28:39
Jesus.... This woulda been nice to know �� lmao
@_date: 2019-02-21 12:29:24
Holy crap, that's a big deal haha. Which are custodial (esp the ones from u/Fly115 list)? Thanks for the info brotha. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 15:42:06
Is this the app you're referring to? --&gt; [

Hasn't been my experience.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:39:24
You are day trading a 3x leveraged asset on Robinhood to begin with... Credibility= 0 ��
2nd off, Robinhood doesn't have a customer service that you can call.. Sooooo?? �� 
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:36:59
Can you say BTrash shill �� pathetic
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:01:49
**LIMIT ORDERS**
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:27:19
It is not an insult, nor is it directed at you. It's just a fact, that Bitcoin Trash is trash. They went as far to make "bitcoin.com" their domain, couldn't even make it "bitcoincash, or bcash.com" that's how desperate they are, speaks for itself... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I wouldn't expect a BTrash supporter to get it though. Can't teach stupid.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:02:16
Said no one, ever. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:06:40
@_date: 2018-07-09 19:15:35
It does not show avg price per coin (ie: I bought 0.1 BTC at $3K and 0.1 BTC $4K, so my avg price for my 0.2 BTC is $3.5K). 
Also, the graph does not take into account new buys, it adds that as "profit", which is really lame and makes the graph useless. 
I have posted this before, like 4-5 months ago, but no changes, therefore I wanna switch.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:45:56
Says the guy with the username "CryptoNoobieFOMO"..... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Worst wallet ever, FYI. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:57:09
Pure idiocy/ignorance right here... Must be nice to be naive. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:05:54
I'm almost positive it wouldn't help, but it definitely can't hurt... Try contacting their customer support? Is there ANYWHERE you maybe copied your priv keys to that you could remember?!
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:00:08
Who the hell thought that would "REVOLUTIONIZE" transportation? The fuck.

How does "tipping" in LN work exactly on reddit?
To answer the question though, LN is still in "beta". Just like it took segwit a while to roll out, this will take a while to roll out as well. Just as with any beta software!
@_date: 2018-12-23 16:14:42
Jaxx is shit, I did my research when I used it for like a month. It's complete and utter shit. Don't get so butthurt dude. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:18:56
Do you know what inflation is? You sound pretty damn ignorant and idiotic. "Because the price dropped= hyper-inflation" uhhhh, that's not how it works. And printing money (by the billions, if not trillions+) out of thin air is not "doing a good job". 
PS- Purchasing power of the dollar is down 96 PERCENT in the past 100yrs. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 00:35:44
That's awesome, how does that work??
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:57:55
Which wallet were you using? Exodus? 
Maybe you could try contacting whichever wallet, customer support. If you don't have your priv keys though, you surely are 99% screwed man. Unfortunately, this is one of the downsides of crypto. Lose your priv keys, and you're screwed basically. I have my priv keys backed up on an offline SD Card. I also keep my Ledger, and my 24 word backup phrase in 2 completely separate places.
@_date: 2018-12-23 00:00:22
Jesus Christ the stupidity here is on a level in which is so pointless to argue with. "The FED has done an amazing job at keeping prices stable, and inflation in check...... 96% loss in value is a feature" HAHAHAHHAAA!!! Good ones.
PS- Why do people have SAVINGS ACCOUNTS in a bank (which is in USD)?? DERR. Jesus.
No coiners like you will always be behind, you'll probably buy your first Bitcoin at $30K+. Good luck guy.
