Would archive.is preserve all the comments? Or just the timeline of the page? I can only assume that page will be heavily moderated any day now

Do you not realize how stupid this sounds? You're saying "they all lie, so I'll pick the on with the best lies." You could've voted for Johnson or Bernie, they both seemed honest to me.


Literally everything he's done since taking office. His hand must be getting tired at this point with all the unconstitutional orders he's signing. The only good thing he's done has been to drop out of the tpp, but I don't have any faith he won't replace it with something worse, and it doesn't come close to making up for all the awful authoritarian establishment staff picks he's made, way to "drain the swamp." 
Not to mention firing or shutting out anyone in government who actually wants to do their job. I really am sick of this thing you righties are doing. It's like someone says "the skies blue" and you say "which parts specifically are blue?" You're not trying to actually have an honest discussion, you're feigning ignorance to halt discussion. The more paranoid part of me thinks there's some kind of underlying organization pushing this, just because of how often I'm seeing it. It's literally like you're all following the same script.
But honestly the biggest reason I don't like trump IS his supporters.and it's not the media or internet giving me the impression that they're mostly mouth breathing rednecks, it is real life. I can't tell you how many interactions I've had at work, at the gym, or anywhere else in public with seemingly normal people who say something in support of trump and then in the same breath say "I'm not racist but [something mildly to very racist]." Or better yet they say they're fans of some policy that will absolutely not benefit them in any way, but I've seen poor to lower middle class conservatives vote against their own interest my whole life so that's less surprising. But the racism that has come out of the woodwork recently is a surprise to me, I genuinely thought America had come further than that.

Trump had the lowest approval rating of any incoming president in history. Insulting Obama or Hillary or liberals doesn't make him any better, he's a shit president and you're a shit person for supporting him
@_date: 2017-02-01 12:41:46
We have 3 different comment chains going, and to be honest I don't spend that much effort dealing with racist trolls. 
Trump is a disgrace and everyone knows it, except for people like you who spend so much time in your little safe spaces that you think he's some kind of genius. Everyone who voted for him is either an ideologue, racist, or just so incredibly stupid that they think a complete buffoon will somehow bring the country back to some idealized version of a past that never even existed. 
You have nothing going for you other than your skin color, so you hold onto it like it somehow makes your shitty life better than someone else's who has real accomplishments.
Keep trolling if you like, but we're done here
@_date: 2017-02-01 00:36:41
Ostensibly yeah, but I've never noticed any increase in civil liberties, privacy, or any practical measure of freedom come from Republican admonistrations
@_date: 2017-02-01 22:14:36
Lol so all news you don't like is fake news. Got it
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:34:09
Lol if facts and data had any effect on idiots like you, you wouldn't be trumps little lapdogs
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:32:50


What? Elections are always on a Tuesday


Did you miss the part where he lost the popular vote? Youre a special kind of stupid
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:45:57


So vote third party, or stay home. It's not a football bet, you don't get any points for supporting the winner if that winner is a sociopath that you don't truly agree with.
 &gt;Many of us also just always vote republican because we want less tax and less regulation 
This is hilarious. No Republican actually decreases the size of government or the tax burden in any meaningful way for average citizens. They say they will, but then they just do it for big businesses, usually the industries that they have some financial stake in. How many times will you rednecks keep falling for the same bait and switch? But I guess it's easier to just go with a column on the ballot than actually look at individual candidates and policies. Don't want to make your brain hurt now do we?


I already told you I think the media is utter shit. But you have to keep harping on it because that's the right's boogeyman. It's your version of Russia, 'the patriarchy,' or whatever shadowy conspiracy some other fringe group claims is keeping them down.
No, it couldn't possibly be that an idiot got elected because our election cycle is more like a reality TV series than a political system. It must be 'the media' (cue spooky music) making a genius look like an imbecile. Keep going with your victim mentality
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:10:20
Literally buried treasure, pretty exciting actually
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:37:23
Not all trump supporters are racist, but all racists are trump supporters. Maybe you're not racist, but you're still supporting an idiot
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:23:28
Legal immgrants are citizens, despite your racism
@_date: 2017-02-01 00:17:35
Are you forgetting he lost the popular vote? I do enjoy the fact that trumps lackeys are mistaking Hillary being awful for Trump being great. It's like they've completely forgotten how miserable most of the country was that these were the only 2 options. The alt right seems to think that Trump's victory is evidence of some kind of paradigm shift in the country, even though he didn't even win the popular vote. They spend so much time in their little echo chambers that they think everyone is as racist and stupid as they are
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:41:46
Except the analogy still holds because the determining factor is popularity not technical features
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:26:25
Ok troll
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:31:14
I wouldn't trust the mainstream media any more than I'd trust Hillary. But that doesn't mean trump isn't a complete idiot like yourself
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:32:08
I never said I was a fan of Obama, that's why you're a troll.

When the tools are automated, it doesn't matter if you're high profile or not. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:52:53
Well I said that with the assumption that trust is part of it as well. Its currency after all. I'm just saying it's incomplete to say that just because another coin has more abilities it should 'already be more popular'. There were and are plenty of social network sites that have more functionality than facebook, but none of them took over from myspace, because it's a popularity contest
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:01:57

Complete replacement of fiat currency, I would think.
 The appeal of Bitcoin as I understand it is that it is anonymous, instantly transferrable worldwide, and not subject to inflation. Basically all the things that suck about traditional money, Bitcoin sokves.
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:39:01
I love these people who are circlejerking about trump keeping promises, even if those promises are to do things that destroy the country. Idiots abound

32 yr old guy, have a career and own a house so not sure if i fall into the millenial category. But i sure as hell dont trust banks. What kind of gullible fool would?
Also, what's with all the old people hating on millenials in here? What did they/we do to you?
@_date: 2016-09-28 04:46:09
Is this supoosed to be “convert your 401k to gold and bitcoin” level of bad, or not so bad
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:59:47
Prob wait for a dip then jump in. Who knows though? It could drop back under 1k next week and stay there for a year or two. Or it could shoot from here right to 10m in 6 months, no way to know. But most people think that this is just the beginning so....hodl
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:56:43
The transfer fee would be more than his account. And the fees have been a hot topic lately because they've been rising
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:15:59
Why would they though?
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:50:43
But if you have your coins in cold storage you'll have what? Both types of coins after the fork?
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:27:34
Yeah, one of the things I wonder about is if cryptos eventually become the most used currencies. What will people call the equivalent of a dollar, and how much of a coin will that be?
You know, aside from wondering which crypto will be king

So should I take this to mean that if I do nothing before August 1st, then wait for the clear 'winner' in the hard fork scenario, and sell of the loser afterwards (or just hold both) that I won't really lose anything? Other than whatever dip happens in btc's price as a result of the FUD of course. 
If so that's the best news I've heard in weeks regarding all this drama
