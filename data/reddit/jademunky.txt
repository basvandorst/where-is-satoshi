Lol no it’s because btc is the main trading pair with everything. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:27:45
The answer is very simple - btc is the main trading pair with most other coins. So if bitcoin moves up, everything moves up in fiat value as they are priced in bitcoin. 
If a coin is worth 0.01 BTC and then bitcoin doubles in dollar value, if the coin stays flat at 0.01 BTC it will have also doubled in indirect dollar value.

Announcing when he will announce the next announcement 
@_date: 2019-03-20 17:50:31
Looks like it will eventually :)
“In our next release, we are planning to add Loop In, which enables users to refill their Lightning channels with on-chain bitcoin from wallets or exchanges. As a user makes a series of purchases via Lightning, her channel balance decreases. She can then use Loop In to refill her funds on Lightning from a regular on-chain bitcoin wallet or via an exchange account, and continue to add additional funds as necessary. ”

Yea you’re right! I wonder what would be a more real world equivalent?

I know it skips lots of important details, but the idea is that a block size increase should be the end game, and only implemented when on-chain transactions and later 2 solutions are optimised first.

Not quite, some are much more useful than others. The reason I say market cap is misinterpreted is that there seems to be a lot of people that think market cap is how much all of the supply of a coin is worth, or even how much money has been invested. This is not true at all.
Someone could make a shitcoin today with 10 trillion tokens and if they trade one for one cent it suddenly has a market cap of $100 billion. Also some of the shitcoins with million dollar market caps could be dropped to zero with just a few thousand dollar market order of the books are thin enough

Hey dude, if you’re in Europe you should really consider using Bittr to buy bitcoin! You set up an account with just an email address and bitcoin address and then you get a reference number. Then you can just send euros via SEPA transfer (can do in Revolut for free) and they market buy and send bitcoin direct to your wallet within a few hours. Plus they are excellent at batching transaction so the miner fee is always tiny.
I’ve completely moved to them from Coinbase as the UX is way better, and less fees overall.

Also Ruben Waterman who runs it did a great episode on tales from the crypt

True, but it’s a fairly useless metric and is often poorly interpreted

Who are/were your main clients? If you can’t give exact names, roughly what sorts of industries are the main clients? Public sector/finance/advertisers etc??
@_date: 2019-06-10 07:37:04
Cool! How exactly does the spontaneous payment work in terms of balance? Is it paying from on chain to a lightning node spontaneously? Or is it paying via lightning but in a brand new channel? Or some other way? Thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:43:46
Ya and through VPN
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:32:49
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:43:07
Thanks for the info :)
@_date: 2019-06-10 07:49:26
Ah so it’s a way of paying with lightning without needing a bespoke invoice per transaction? That’s pretty neat if so - I imagine there would be some privacy trade off with providing your node ID?
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:44:31
Woah. Well what I don’t know is what the odds are of successfully mining a block from a normal computer, like is it in the same order as these lottery odds or way off??
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:37:15
On a computer

For iOS I’d recommend GreenWallet for the best overall wallet in terms of more advanced functionality.
Or for ease of use and simplicity, Blue Wallet is great. You can also use Lightning through BlueWallet which allows for super cheap and instant transactions - however this is a custodial lightning solution so there’s a trade between having full custody of your bitcoin and making it super easy to use lightning.
Both use SegWit which makes fees a bit lower.
Most importantly - store your backup seed safely before sending any coins to the wallet!

This is the answer I was looking for

The r/btc guys warned me of propaganda over on this sub!
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:43:08
Nice, this addresses my question. At the current value, I think 1s/b is an adequate lower limit, but I think something like that PR would be more important if the value goes up dramatically to the point  1s/b is no longer arbitrarily small
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:00:26
That sucks, could also be an issue with your bank?
I’ve only used it directly with bitcoin so haven’t had any experience with fiat deposits/withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-04-27 14:03:58
@_date: 2019-04-29 07:38:49
This may be your issue??
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:38:57
Yea but at one cent per Satoshi, a 1sat/byte transaction would cost ~$1-3. My question is how would a fee market work if $1-3 was the lower limit and people wanted to bid lower
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:29:11
Yea the Abra app is actually just a non-custodial HD wallet with the option to get price exposure to lots of other assets, all using the security of bitcoin.
Obviously it’s not going to be for everyone, but it’s nice to see a different way of using bitcoin within a business!

Having my first attempt at lightning on BlueWallet, anyone fancy sending me 1 Satoshi to test? 
I created this invoice, is this all that’s needed?

Thank you very much, it all worked smoothly :)
