The holy mecca of bitcoin ������������ this is quite interesting i wonder whats gonna happen at devcon when the ceo of ummmmmm sec pulls out the fat rule book ��

Countless i always loved spending bitcoins to keep them in circulation. I remember when btc was a lil egg ready to hash. But the monster it became D: untamable. Lol wreckless!!!! Like a bowling ball taking down those pins aka all those peoples bearing the market at the time.

When I find that that is possible. At what rate will bitcoins keep being lost. And on average how Many a day. Think of the real output in circulation. Drives me nuts. Now although they will go up in value. I'm a thousand years how many bitcoins would have been lost.

Now the revolution is a tight niche. And has a bumch of fucked up nooses. Like those things all tangled up. The problem right now is that there will be a second sec. And its kinda what the bitcoin protocol is. I was no where near expecting the rise of btc to reach 20k in 2017. After the ceo of Mt. Gox foumd out how many people he affected im glad that another alt came around and the name was meth. Aka ether aka ethereum. Now we have  lot of small dictator protocols but with a lot of loopholes that its almost hard to imvest in them. Btc doesnt need sec approval and the sec doesnt wanna regulate it. Its like having 2 kids fight for whats right. What do you think? Welll we have the federal reserve sorry to mention but they have brought our country to great not peffected economy but a very well put structure even whwn they loaned so much that it caused scholars running other nations to ruin because they grew to small or had bad policies and the given structure was to much.
