My biggest thing with btc is the limited number of coins. If people adopt on a larger scale prices will go through the roof. I’m afraid of regulation and a different coin to come a long that can solve some of the challenges with btc. That said it wouldn’t shock me to see 100k one day. It also wouldn’t shock me if it went to zero.
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:45:02
Tell me when it hits 12k again and I'll care. I wonder how that guy who put his life and family's savings in at 18k is doing.

If you’re a btc miner that’s not very much right now
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:01:08
oh gotcha
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:20:01
Why wouldn't they announce this before the fork? Really doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:38:42
Yeah should have put “and remain”

I would convert everything I own to gold if this were ever a thing. I guess I'm a bit confused by this, but wouldn't borrowing, i.e. buying a property, be very attractive?
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:11:50
I felt like I had to answer to so many people when it crashed after 20k. “Why didn’t you sell at 20k”?
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:54:01
Because the bank can’t take gold. They can take your cash though.
@_date: 2019-02-17 14:49:51
I think it used to be considered this more so. 
@_date: 2019-02-17 14:43:42
Sure but at some point real estate becomes more attractive at home due to banks paying you to borrow

I truly respect buffett and really think he's worth following and learning from. He is a highly intelligent and very interesting guy. His shareholder letters are some of the most insightful pieces you can read about investing and money management. He's kinda become an enemy to some on here, which I think is a bit irrational. Here's a few reasons why he may not be too keen on bitcoin:
1. He's old, doesn't understand it and/or doesn't care to learn. He knows what he knows and he's damn good at what he knows, and when he's wrong he has the uncanny ability to take a step and unemotionally dissect his mistake. He and Charlie have an imaginary "too hard" pile. If it's something they can't understand or don't want to put the effort in to understanding, in the too hard pile it goes.
2. He hates gold, he thinks it's as much of a pile of garbage as bitcoin. He doesn't see the purpose of it and wants to put his money to work. He believes wholeheartedly and has working proof that investing in great companies outperforms gold. In his most recent shareholder letter he flat out explained this to prove the point. Bitcoin is thought of as digital gold.
3. He's a capitalist and believes in american dollars at work. He's been comfortable working in dollars ever since his paper route and pinball business as a youth. Bitcoin may take away from the dollar.

Yes, the market is overvalued. Yes our banking system is not fair. Is it really his fault for capitalizing? Buffett has been in the market since before we went off a gold backed system. He buys great businesses that would produce gold standard or not.  I own gold and btc because I don’t trust fiat, but that’s me. 
I doubt he’s ever publicly stated bitcoin sucks on his own. Guaranteed he’s asked every time. He’s not one to shy away from stating his opinion of something however harsh it is.
@_date: 2019-06-07 09:27:25
This too. A lot of his investments rely on keeping the dollar relevant, but I really do think that it’s more so he’s kinda set in his ways at this point and truly believes the dollar is the most powerful currency on the planet.
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:46:12
He was a millionaire before age 30 and couldn't manipulate markets then. I agree when buffett buys something the market takes notice, but he's definitely self made. He earned a lot of his money by being a great investor.

It’s been pulling back for a while and we’re now seeing bullish signals. This is an entry point. It could go down again, but really this is the best it’s looked in a while.
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:29:16
That’s a bold statement 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:12:19
Finally a religion I can get behind
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:01:03
That would be amazing
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:49:21
No it is not. How? Look at a chart overlay of usd to bitcoin. It's not even close to a correlation. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 00:03:12
Sorry, I'm shitfaced right now and I thought you were calling me an idiot. Lol. To be fair though some of those idiots are already rich.
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:39:18
Absolutely. But the dollar and Bitcoin are not inversely correlated. I guess that was my point. If the global economy failed there would be implications to currencies around the globe.
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:33:39
Wait, what? All I said was Bitcoin is not correlated to the dollar. Many are saying that and this is totally wrong. I purchased a small amount of Bitcoin as a speculative bet to see what happens. Block chain is a very groundbreaking technology, but that's basically where it stops for me. I mostly invest in companies. I upvoted I cringe at the comments in this vote. We're probably in agreement. I got more insterested in it when I heard Bill Miller had 50% of his fund in Bitcoin before it blew up to 20k.
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:01:46
It's totally irrational to think this way. Bitcoin is not pegged to dollar in any way shape or form. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 00:09:36
If the dollar goes down, does Bitcoin go up? I meant to say inversely correlated. It's the strength of the currency itself that drives price. The dollar is means to purchase Bitcoin, but it's not pegged to it.
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:50:02
The statement was Bitcoin is a measure of how weak the dollar is. Please explain how that is a true statement.
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:35:06
Long term adoption is what matters.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:46:06
Can you actually do limit orders on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:36:31
Started buying Bitcoin earlier this year. It's fun to watch, but I'm not selling shit for at least 10 years.
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:38:15
If it hits $100k per coin I'd consider it. My investment was made with money I don't need, so I'm really just in it to see what happens. To be honest, I'm not even convinced bit coin is the future. It may be another block chain tech that ultimately prevails. One of the major draws for me is that earnings yield in the stock market is pretty much zero and we are due for a major pull back. Schiller p/e has been higher only two other times in recent history, the 1930's crash and the internet bubble. Here's my one problem with digital currency, when there is a giant cyber attack (and there will be one day) that takes the internet down, digital currency will be worthless and hard assets like gold and even cash become much more valuable. Also not convinced that Trump gets a second term.
