It's called fractional reserve banking. Look it up. It's actually worse than you think. Yes, they do print more eventually but that's not the main method of creating money.

No, he wasn't. Stop talking out of your ass.

You're the quintessential redditard. Congrats.

Please post in if you want an intelligent conversation.

Yes, Quebecois can be a bunch of assholes, hence my comment about me living in Canda  and hating the place, but do you have any idea how moronic and bigoted your comment sounded? I don't represent French Canadians, and I certainly don't go to Florida in the winter. For one, I enjoy cold much more than intense summer heat. You can keep your skin cancer and alligators, I'll enjoy my snow over here.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:14:54
I live there. Wrong assumption buddy.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:03:39
NO! Just give us your money, and we'll make sure you get it. For a fee. The world is too complex for you to handle your own decisions and consequences, lest you sue for trivial incidents and blame everyone except yourself.

You're trying common sense on the retards of @_date: 2014-02-22 18:04:04
Well, not the French I worked with, except for those few that have been living here for a few years.
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:24:09
You and 98% of this sub.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:17:45
Spoken Quebecois is not French.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:25:56
And the French will not understand half the words.
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:42:01
I don't give a flying fuck about your problems with other French Canadians in Florida. It's none of my concerns and none of my business.
Why do you have to complain to me? What the fuck does that even fucking do, what's the purpose? I said I don't go to Florida. You think I'll go in the streets of Montreal and tell everyone some self-entitled American on reddit hates Quebecois that go to Florida?
Stop replying to me, please. I'm done. I just don't give a fuck.

Aren't you creative...

I live in Canada  I hate Quebec :(

Although I agree with you, still this is semantics. It's a CNN report, I don't know why we're focusing on this.

He's agreeing that *some* people *are too dumb* to run their own lives, not him in particular.
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:20:14
Semantics. They got the general idea to the population at large.

That's one of my usernames... I've been surfing this site for close to 5 years. Don't judge a book by its cover, idiot.

What's more suprising is Iceland who had one of the worst banking corruption fiasco and is hostile to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:49:04
Very well. Point taken.

So, the sum of the age of all bitcoins moved (volume) during a specific time period?

Human behavior is real, whether it's in a game or in real life. What don't you understand from this concept?
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:53:58
You mean Africa? Maybe India? Or maybe the slave workers in China making nearly all the products we're all buying? How about the people in North Korea? Or the Muslim countries that are under extremist repressive regimes that kill them without regards?
You think the fall of the U.S. dollar will cause lots human suffering? You don't think the **people**, not the government, will make the best of this and not pull through? The dominance wasn't built on a country of bigots. The U.S. used to be an amazing country before the government went psycho on every front.
Chill dude.

At its current state, it's a simple, virtual stock that people put their faith in, i.e., their hard-earned fiat money. Period. Everything else is left in the speculation bin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:43:36
If you're treating it like a stock, then please sell because your attitude towards the whole concept is toxic.

The only apartments I've heard about without a roof were in Cuba. Care you elaborate why they add this particular detail?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:08:18


Seriously, most people here don't give a flying fuck about Bitcoin as a currency. They are looking to make a quick buck and they talk about "investment" instead of talking about the ideals behind this new tech.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:02:37
You sound like those retards over in Don't reply to me.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:31:35
Stop the psychotic traders treating it like a stock. That's never going to happen. It's no longer a currency nor anonymous. I don't think it was ever meant to be worth anything in the first place.
If you ever played or read about Eve Online, then you know what human nature can do, and we're talking about an online game here, not real money. It's only going to rise in instability until something brakes hard or centralizes, which completely defeats the purpose of the whole concept.
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:23:42
Wtf? Do you even history?
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:52:06
That is a level of retard I've not encountered yet.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:54:53
Then PAY SOME TAXES!!! Seriously, it's not all that bad if your government is not a psychotic demagogue.

Could you help me configure my miner? I'm only getting stales on the Red Light District pool. I tried changing the port but it's a no go.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:26:09
They really are shooting themselves in the foot. I can't believe they actually did this. They'll just fall faster it seems.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:16:46
Me too man.
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:45:11
Don't sell yourselves short. As a Canadian and having an external (and somewhat neutral) view while being very close, I think I experience the most extremes of the spectrum. I can say that the smart one will band and renew the country to what it's supposed to be. The cattle will turn into sheep and follow the strong, and they will be forced to change their external views of their immediate world or fail and be left in the ditch.
There's an incredible amount of human power in the U.S. that's being tremendously repressed by the powers that be. The cattle are loud right now because they are allowed to be. They are supported on a crumbling foundation and will fall with it. The States need a good 'ol revolution, as sad as this might sound.

Why is Quarkcoin still talked about? It never was even relevant in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:09:43
Don't. Any advise other than "I don't know" is moronic.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:40:54
Fuck off you spamming piece of shit.
