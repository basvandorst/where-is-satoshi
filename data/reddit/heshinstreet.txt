About 1.3-1.5m.. sheeesh I’m not a financial advisor so I am not going to try and talk you out of whatever you want to do but good luck. Did you know that BTC is not the only crypto? Facebook, amazon, and I think instagram are in the process of coming out with their own crypto’s. Also, asking a stranger on reddit seems insane. I would advise you find a financial advisor/investor who can help you. Are you looking to trade the 200 coins so they multiply faster? or are you looking to put them in accounts until they grow like stocks?

Good luck! BTCUSD is insane. You’re Better off trading currency pairs. Just my opinion. Also, if you’re just one entity/person that has big money, (just my opinion) learn to trade yourself :) I say that in the most respectful way possible. I am self taught and am very happy with my results. I learn everyday on the market and there’s always more to learn. I’ve learned that people preach like they know what’s up just to take money and they really don’t know how to strategically place trades that win pips consistently. Are you a company? Or a singular individual? What are your goals?

We’ll be safe and good luck.

What do intend to receive? What is your goal? And 200 hundred? What do you mean?

Sounds like you’re exploring the darkness lol.... you can make a bitcoin wallet the legit way, then use a laundromat/fog machine to third party your transfer so that it remains anonymous while you’re browsing and purchasing, anonymously. Not speaking from experience.. I uh, have a “friend” who at one point wanted to buy anonymously online. Heard it all works out.

A laundromat is a place to wash ya clothes if you don’t have a washer/dryer in your house.. a fog machine is vital accessory to a haunted house.
