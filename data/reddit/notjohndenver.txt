I've spent years looking at securities markets and this shit simply doesn't make any sense. Nobody has a clue what will happen in 7..30..90 days.

I think there's a few lenses to look at this through..
* Make my short/mid term goals happen (pay off student loan and get down payment for a house): 5-10 BTC  
* Make my longer term goals happen (open my own business/put money away for my kids college): 10-20 BTC  
* Never have to work again: 100-500 BTC

The same thing that would happen if any primary security holder dropped their stake in a security.

I didn’t roll those in to my original “close to 40%” statement. 35% is somewhat close to 40% but yes, I slightly exaggerated the paycheck deduction for income tax. If I did roll those taxes in it would certainly be ~40%.

So..how is what I said in my original post wrong?

I’ve never seen anything like this.

I'm in the 2-4% range of annual income and I pay pretty close to 40% in taxes. Mostly thanks to California's lovely ~9% state income tax.

Ah gotcha.. I was looking at the WSJ calculator but the CNN calculator puts me in the 5-6 percentile.
