Great now dumb asses who believe in chem trails can order dvd's about how the government is instituting mind control via jet fuel additives with bitcoin.

They are so very obviously insolvent.

You can't write checks from a savings account or withdraw directly from it at an atm.  Saving accounts at my bank pay double to quadruple the best checking account rates. Which still isn't much my checking account pays &lt;1% interest.

Yea and it could be again.

My checking account pays interest. Not very much but they pay me to have a checking account.

So German banks like to stick it to poor people just like American banks do.

At this point I'm totally ok with soaking and even fucking over the rich. They have it coming to them. Particularly in America.

I think of the idea of fiat as the only means to settle debts is via the dollar from the government's perspective. So if you want to trade, chickens, marbles, gold or dollars you can do so, but when ever the government is involved everything must be settled via dollars. So tax debts, fines, court judgements, etc.

Honestly I'd like to see more of this. The whole point of this policy is to put rich people in a position of needing to spend/invest or else.
@_date: 2014-10-31 21:03:23
How so? Because America isn't' all that socialist or because poor people vote completely against their own self interest?

This it the kind of thinking that resulted in our plutocratic society. "Lets not burden the rich which taxes they can afford it, or make access to education equal because I'm going to be rich someday!"
“Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.”

MtGox's behavior suggests to me that they are insolvent and the delays are because they are waiting for deposits to come in so they can cover their withdraws.
If you consider that MTGox tends to trade bit coins for around $100 more then other exchanges, the arbitrage opportunity is probably very attractive to people, possibly creating a larger volume of withdraws than deposits.
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:56:31
My fear is that MTgox is in fact insolvent.

I'm pretty pissed off I think I'm going to leave coinbase over this

I'm not pleased with the $800 plus price tag for a bit coin. I'm just waiting for the profit takers to want to cash out and collapse the price.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:57:35
I know, but I want a whole coin, you know cuz.
