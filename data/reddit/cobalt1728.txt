So they bought the futures from who?

How the hell can they afford that? 100x leverage?  Jesus.  One person loses and that person owes 100x the initial investment?

Okay, what the fuck.

I havent....  I just want to buy some Bitcoin, ethereum and Litecoin and some XRP and sit on it for years....  What is the best way to do that?
I am using coinbase.  I am waiting for a 1200 dollar deposit to hit before I can buy

Just saw that list, I think Bittrex is on there.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:53:06
How will I be able to sell BCC?  Like if I own my own wallet, how can I trade BCC?  Will it be on Bittrex?
