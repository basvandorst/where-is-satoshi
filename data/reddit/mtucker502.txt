So what prevents me from spending the same coin on both networks?

Now you're assuming they have equivalent sums of BTC and USD in the amount they need to pay you in. Either way, it's still better **for you** if the BTC price is down.

If the value was down it would **benefit** you. You would receive more BTC per USD.

How did you take this picture?

It wasn't until I couldn't find "socks" in the article that I finally realized Millennials hate "S**t**ocks"

You mock but this bird's sonic boom didn't wake you up Sunday morning.

I have a $300 limit but I'm also verified. Bank limit is at $5k.

I tried to switched from Coinbase to Cdex but they don't support Florida. I'm waiting for verification at Gemini still.
Is Kraken an option? I'm also waiting for verification there right now but their limits are much higher.

I'm using GDAX but I have the same Coinbase limits as everyone else. Plus ACH takes 5 business days and sometimes a transaction takes 1-2 hours to become verified. That is forever.

I'm still new unlearned enough to ask: Why is more hashing power equivalent to more security?

What other exchanges are you using? Gemini? 
Once I am verified I'll check their limits.
