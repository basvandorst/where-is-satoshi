I'd driven down to use the Robocoin ATM the weekend it was released and the scan freaked me and bunch of others who were there to try it out.
I think your bank teller analogy is a bit off. The analogy in this context would be my Bank's ATM machine. The Lamassu implementation doesn't go through all this fuss when people are buying Bitcoins and I think I would naturally gravitate to that as opposed to the Robocoin.
As long as the govt impose stern and in some cases unwarranted regulations, the alternatives like local bitcoins will thrive! People like me who are not anarchist will start working with the alternatives. The only option then in the hands of the ones who imposed the regulations would be ostracize the ones who are using the alternatives which would just result in increased animosity.

* The girl is colored orange and the guy grey so does that mean that only females are interested in business and guys in society? I would expect the circles to be pies with proportional sizes for each demographics!
* The relative likehood should be in descending/ascending order of likehood or alphabetical. Instead of making it look like a temperature gauge just write the 'vs the general public on top or somewhere. It unfortunately gives an impression that to the right is general public.
* Does this mean that the general masses are just indifferent regarding everything?

Andreas, you did very well there. I think the best narrative is what you have taken up where we are composed and just tell them the facts instead of getting tangled in their rhetorics and getting animated! I personally liked the points regarding ATM and the flash crashes on the stock markets. 
Pardon me if I'm stepping out of my bounds while being critical, I think your argument against Trish's point about hacking that 'its a fundamental misunderstand...' gives out an impression that the framework is so complicated that even educated reporters can't grasp it. That I believe gives a negative vibe to perhaps an average viewer. In your defense though the framework is complicated.
All in all, your approach of drawing analogies from the existing is the best bang per word spoken that we can get.

This is the truth. Unlike in mainland US where I'm currently, these folks had video streaming to phone since way back when! People spend hours staring at their phones browsing and watching than anything else. One of the things I noticed was the space constraint they have.

The closing question is exactly my concern. The VCs and Wall Street that's trying to come in now are just doing so for profits and perhaps will be parasitic to the framework. I'm afraid that gradually, as in the 'war on drugs' and the 'gravity' example, we will be long way off from where we are here or how we felt few months/years back and will have no recollection of it. Bitcoin or the the popular crypto currency of the time would be a half assed frankenstein monster which is neither here nor there but far worse than Fiat. :|

Wow, I'm now somewhat optimistic regarding the NY govt making an effort to not stifle the bitcoin. Mr Lawsky in my opinion has come a long way from being a skeptic to someone who is moderately optimistic regarding this currency. His rebuttal to Mr Greenspan's comments bears this evidence. There were also hits about they considering bitcoin as a currency as opposed to a commodity which is also a good news. As someone who viewed the hearings, I could feel him warming up the the whole notion and the potential of bitcoin.

I think the argument is flawed. Don't you already spend money for rent, gas, food etc? Imagine all the bitcoin you could buy with all that money!

For bitcoin the problem set has already been laid out and all the nodes are trying to solve that problem. The ASICs which contribute the highest computation are manufactured to solve this specific problem. Hence resources has been committed with a framework in mind and it would be a non-trivial task to change the framework. Also there arises the question of who decides whether a problem is worth being solved by the bitcoin community. With original bitcoin version, no one had a choice and hence no debate.
Having said so, you can come up with a new crypto which address the problem you want to solve.

I think its a good attempt by the Congressman but a bad precedent. The Robocoin is more complicated to use as opposed to Lamassu/Liberty Teller's.

The experience with robocoin had been negative and I hope it doesn't become the role model.

The argument is that only the cold wallet was seized. Hence Gox was able to remain operational for some period of time until their hot wallets got drained out.


Look where we are. I think it has been a very smart move.
* It influenced the community so strongly that we screaming for regulations!
* It removes from the playing field a strong independent player with a long heritage and paves ways for puppet exchanges which would do their bidding just to make money. These newcomers are not in with a libertarian agenda but pure greed. So much so that they are willing to throw exchanges and peoples saving out of the window.


I believe this would happen. There is no need to rush it. It would be seized and then auctioned. Guess who would be taking coins home?


They could have learned from their mistakes and included terms against disclosure. As someone else mentioned the other day, if Apple has to place Warrant Canary, then this is a possibility.


If stolen or lost, the coins would not be "temporarily unavailable".
*Full Disclosure: I've NO money tied up at Gox*
*Disclaimer: I'm speculating just as you are speculating.*

In this movement the consumers would be the brick &amp; mortar/online stores. They will drive it as the benefit is transaction cost. Just look at the number of purchases being done online. Amazon has grocery services in certain places here. If online stores for day-to-day items goes mainstream then the only place you may be paying physically would be restaurants, massage parlors, spa etc. If you think they wont move to crypto then just look at the number of places where American Express is not accepted! 
The second wave would be the remittance market. In the current global economy a far larger populace is dislocated and its just going to grow as for example more Chinese flee their homeland due to harsh environment and other political economical reasons in many parts of the world. Example being the third world countries like BRIC where the inflation is at all time high.
The third wave would be from countries undergoing financial resurrection like Greece, Cypress and many more to come when the [quantitative easing thing shows its ugly side](
The fourth wave would be from independent countries which have strong domestic economy with low % tied to trade and want to shield themselves from the volatility and monetary politics of say Euro zone or US.

I seriously feel for Matt. He is going against his organization's flow (so to speak) to voice his opinions on Bitcoin and he is doing an incredible job. I've rarely seen people in mainstream media be so passionate and vocal about things. He gets all my well wishes.
The only thing that I believe holds him back is I believe his reporting style. His persona on screen is different (edgy/animated may be the word I'm looking for) from the stereotypical reporters. Unfortunately I believe the mainstream audience prefers the latter. The Max Keisers or Jon Stewarts don't fare well on these networks.

I would be very interested in seeing the price of BTC overlapped to this chart and also perhaps the number of coins the % represents as it may show an inverted curve to this.

Sometimes when the solution has been stated, the problem looks simple. It's the intellectual leap that is required to go to a higher plane to look at the problem from a different plane is the hard part. Credit where credit is due. Also, one needs expertise in one of the components, not necessarily on all.

I wasn't aware of this. Will do further research. I'm assuming they may not provide all the services that a branched bank provides like cashier's check. Also do they charge for withdrawing cashb from atm given that they won't have as many atms and I wud have to use another bank's atm?

The maintenance of infrastructure what we know as blockchain is incentivized by bitcoin. There could be a decoupled blockchain but then it won't have the features that bitcoin has which in the first place made them want to use the blockchain in the first place.

It's discomforting that what you read in alt-media and are deemed as conspiracy theories are now being published in mainstream media. Seems like an inevitability.

They don't need banks for their cash. There is whole  economy where people use only cash. Also, there is localbitcoins for ones with cash.
