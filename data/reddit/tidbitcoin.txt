It's a further step to make it look detached from the project. The first step was changing the 'forum' link on bitcoin.org to google search results, even though the forum was a subdomain on bitcoin.org.

I had this problem with a couple of my accounts that I had used long randomized passwords with. I was copy+pasting them from a document I had saved them on. So I got on another computer that had cookies for mybitcoin and it went through. I thought 'wtf?' - so I compared my saved passwords list to what my browser was using and realized that some of the characters at the end of the pass were left out when the password was saved (dunno which side did the truncating). 
**My browser had cookied a 25 character password all along when I was convinced my 30/31 character passes were correct.**

"Our response was rash, but necessary." - What about not telling us about this for a whole week, was that necessary?
He didn't have to explain the details (if they weren't known) - but he could have acknowledged shutting down the site and working on the problem so it didn't look like he was either dead or a rich thief.
