Fiat as in government-issued non-backed currency.
Yes, BTC is technically fiat (a non-backed currency), but it is decentralized and has no central authority governing its inflation, deflation, or distribution.

1) Look at the IRS' definition of it. It is a capital asset, and users must pay capital gains taxes on it.
2) Useless? It can be used to transfer funds across the world instantly. It does this better than cash, checks, and wire transfers. It also does this with little to no fee.
The protocol can be used for issuing stocks, bonds, contracts, deeds, and other legal documents because any message attatched to a transaction is in the public blockchain with that transaction.
In nations where mercantilist policy and hyperinflation have made the native currency, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have proven to help with connecting those isolationist economies to the rest of the world.
It will connect the world economy in a much better way than ever before.
