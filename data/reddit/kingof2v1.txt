I opened a can of worms with that one :D

Will do. He just enabled it today, I think the web designer is working on that

Finally got him to do it.  You can use code Holiday for an extra 10% off.
The code BTC will also be active later this week and will be a lifetime 10% off code if you pay using BTC.  Let me know if you guys have any questions!
EDIT: Also working on getting him to accept LTC and other alts (not bcash, sorry)

I keep reading the comments to my brother and he's really happy to hear from all the customers in the crypto scene.  I didn't know we had that kind of reach.  We are a family owned &amp; run business for 32+ years.  When I was a kid I would sit in the back and sort the dead crabs from the live ones when they came in.  Can't count the number of times I've had that spiced shrimp, try it next time with some extra seasoning!  Thanks for the support!

Unfortunately it wouldn't be fresh by the time it got to you :O

Really? Small world!  You ordered from the online site or one of the retail locations? The online delivery service is rather new.

It's coming soon.  Just spoke to the designer and she is adding it.

ALL crypto?  You want the shitcoins and memecoins treated equally as well?  We're within our right not to accept bcash as the nature of their mission is harmful to all of crypto in my opinion.  Killing Bitcoin would be bad for all cryptocurrency and would kill market confidence.  If bcash wanted to work WITH Bitcoin instead of attempting to destroy it then maybe I would have a different opinion.  Roger Ver is greedy, and his actions are both deceiving and malicious.

I will look into it.

SquareCash? Isn't that more for buying/selling bitcoin than accepting it at a retail location?
