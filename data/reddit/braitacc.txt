nice -n 19 /usr/local/bin/bitcoind .......
2 don't put the swap on the sdcard but on the hard drive
A) Remove swap from the sd . find this on google.
B) swap file on the drive : apt-get install -y dphys-swapfile
 nano /etc/dphys-swapfile   CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048                        swap   CONF_SWAPFILE=/media/bitcoin/swapfile     file location

On my pc it is a few days. On my rpi it is about a month but only for the initial sync. If you re smart you can copy your bitcoindata from your pc to the rpi hd and it's instant. Depends on your drive speed. That's why a small pc is better but a rpi can still help and is the cheapest.

I have a better plan to be a millionaire : install bitcoin core. In the console dump and save your public and private keys and print them on paper which you keep it safe. Transfer some bitcoins on this public key with your credit card. Destroy your pc and forget it and enjoy life. Retrieve your bitcoins in 2028. You'd have a pretty good chance to be a millionaire by then.

If you compare techs don't compare it with price day fluctuation of the token. Compare it with an EVEN comparison that is to say in satoshi. This wasn't taught to you in school ? This is common sense. You don't compare gasoline price saying it's cheaper in gallons in USA than in L in the UK with different units. Same here. Also a shitcoin with a value of 0$ will have the tech with the cheapest fee beating any tech according to your "logic".

Bitmain crash.
I repeat  : 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:40:10
Not too long for me on a raspberry pi. It takes me a day to get to 10% sync progress so about 10 days with a raspberry pi and a shitty hard drive. The key is to not set the swap on the sd card and putting the swap on the hard drive (with only two commands)
Also for the first sync (only! remove the options after) use 
-blocksonly : to ignore unconfirmed transactions relay
-dbcache=1024 : for better perfs (if the swap is on the drive)
-maxmempool=5 : same as first point.
you can even add more connections.
I think someone who earned some money with bitcoin can invest a tiny % running a full node I found it to be not so expansive... 2 Tera Byte is no issue for me for a while ... and I can still ad a hard drive..

And what bcash supporters don't get is that the fee is a percent of bitcoin so the fee depends of its value in fiat. So the more bitcoin has value the more the fee value in fiat will be higher. And they compare fees between too coins in fiat with two different market caps and different loads. If you think about it is like a monkey telling you buying gasoline in the US in gallon is cheaper than in france in liters we should adopt gallons. Rigorously we should compare fees in satoshis in ratio to the network load to compare honestly.

The most easy and most safe solution is to install bitcoin core. Then generate a new public key (it will be done automatically when you click request payment). Then send your funds to it.
Now... You only need to save your associated private key. What is so howsome is that the private key is ONLY what you need to recover your funds. You can destroy your pc or your wallet as long as you have the private key. You can store it on a real paper / qrcode  or in a text file ... whatever. Later you can just reinstall bitcoin core on another pc and import the private key.
To save your private key from bitcoin core it is easy : you need two clicks and a simple command :
Go to debug window &gt; console and
Type the following command (unlock your wallet if not already done)
dumpprivkey "your_public_address_key"
The private key will show up. 
Of course don't tell it to anyone. Telling your private key to someone is like giving to him your credit card and pin code.
You can now live peacefully nobody can steal your funds if you control your private key!

SD cards or usb sticks will be slow and will fail or die (I already tested - my usb stick died during synch. RIP). 
Also I was able to boot the rpi 3 b+ on the usb port directly with no sdcard on the rpi with these :
[A usb box for msata to usb]( which work for example with these
[this ssd](
[or this ssd if you only want to boot and replace the sd card for cheap](
I don't undestand why not everybody is doing this and replace sdcards or usb keys. The price of msata is now almost the same and sdcards/sticks will fail very very easily. 
You can also add swap which is handy when you have programs (like bitcoin) requiring a lot of memory. And to boot on usb with no sdcard is also easy (on the rpi 3b+). Just format the usb disk like you would on a sdcard and add a flag in a text file.

I give more steps just in case you had deactivated the swap. if you use raspbian
add swap file on the drive : 


  






save the file 


also to avoid to use too much swap use : -blocksonly -dbcache=256  for the inital sync, you can increase the parameter depending on your free RAM.
you can check that the swap is now 2G by

@_date: 2019-01-04 13:45:57
Well I don't have the exact explanation (only a dev may answer precisely) but I ran several tests and I concluded that a drive swap file is a must if you have a hdd/ssd  (also you very much like have more than 4gb of free space why not use it for the benefits). For example bitcoin core on windows will eat easily 4 gb during sync and is faster if you put let say 8 gb of RAM dedicated for the cache. If you increase the number of peers like me the memory usage increase also.
I noted that on the RPI once bitcoin core start using the whole RAM after some time (and if it use the whole RAM you start to understand what it means...) it start to become really slow, but really. Bitcoin core tries to allocate more RAM and fail and you see a lot of pagination and red if you run atop.....I could go into details... Once you put the swap on the hdd no more red. Also a ssd is fast enough so that the performance boost is huge compared to not using it as a swap.

Rpi 3. The perf is good imo. Even bitcoin qt is working fine. The key is to not set the swap on the sd card and putting the swap on the hard drive (with only two commands - ask me if you need)
Also for the first sync (only! remove the options after) use 
-blocksonly : to ignore unconfirmed transactions relay and gain some perfs
-dbcache=256 or more for better perfs (if the swap is on the drive)
-maxmempool=5 : same as first point.
- compile it yourself with the option o3 to optimize it at max.
-you can even add more connections.
I think someone who earned some money with bitcoin can invest a tiny % running a full node I found it to be not so expansive... 2 Tera Byte is no issue for me for a while ... and I can still ad a hard drive..

When bitcoin had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the world, where there was a network, which he and his disciples entered. Now Roger Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for bitcoin often met there with his disciples. So Roger Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then bitcoin, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, “Whom do you seek?” They answered him, “bitcoin of Satoshi.” bitcoin said to them, “I am he.” Roger Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them

And also remember that bitcoin clones have to merge updates and features done on bitcoin by the huge bitcoin dev community into the clone. This add pressure to smaller teams of the cloned coin resulting in less security and insurances thus resulting in less value for the clone.
This is the reason needless forks in linux or in other dev projects is usually a bad idea, you weaken both branches.

The technical downsides are complicated. Softfork allow the old code and old consensus to run with the new. Hardfork could be the death of the old consensus. Softfork is the best method for compatibilty although sometime you don't have choice. Anyway a good softfork upgrade like segwit was blocked by big corporations for years. Then why not hardfork without prep every two weeks ? And are we sure that 2 MB will always be good or enough ? No. Shall we build a new coin every two weeks? No. Shall we let the wolf amongs the sheeps ? No.  Should you let your computer upgrade and restart with a thirdparty controling it? No. The coin will split. Divide and conquer is a destructive strategy. Who is trying to divide? If you need more block size bcash is already there for them. The next softfork upgrade possible for bitcoin is a side upgrade like LN. It needs prep. The replay protection is a very big downside if the coin split in two with 2x. It is still not well fixed. Also the major companies violated the NYA by creating bcash. Now they want other to respect it now that bcash is failling. Bcash dev team for 2x have messy code. I could continue on and on.

If they spam to prove bitcoin is bad this is retarded but they really must be. They only prove their evil and stupidity at loosing their funds. It prove that any block limit even higher can be hit it by spammers. Satoshi put a limit against spammers. Low limit + high usage (not the case of all crypto) will make the spammer pay more.  So let them pay. They don't even achieve their goal. Also users on LN are now laughting at this.

1)Invent a new name for bitcoin, like bitcoin crash or clash or trash, a name that remind of a crash.
2)Announce a new hard fork client with more blocks. You could have used other ltcoins with 4x the bandwidth or you could have forked bitcoin 2 years ago whenever you wanted but hey don't tell them that.
3)Program it with your feet in 30 minutes. Doesn't matter if buggy.
4) Inject a mass troll in the news announcing it the same day as segwit.
5)Watch in fear noobs or news reader selling their bitcoins in panic, lol
6) buy their cheap jucy bitcoins, better if you are a whale or a millionaire.
7) don't activate your bitcoin trash fork because you have 2% nodes and anyway this was just to troll and this is the client you have control on.
8) Look at the price of bitcoin skyrocketing to the moon.
9) ????
