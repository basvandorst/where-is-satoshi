No, just two examples of harmful things that actual malware may do. Trading cpu cycles for access to a website is not malware.

Lol is this ironic?

Clicking the ad away takes more attention (the resource ads take from you) than just ignoring the ad. Deciding that it is worth your money to take those ads away (or get past a paywall) takes mental effort that is worth more than you would be spending. Background mining can actually be a way of making a very small, very low cost transaction (assuming an algorithm that targets consumer hardware i.e. not bitcoin). You are sending hashes that are worth a small fraction of a block reward. This is as good as sending money but no transaction is recorded in the blockchain.

That might be a good idea. If they did that it would probably be illegal anticompetitive behavior if they blocked other miners though.

Maybe firefox should just make people aware of the mining instead of blocking it then. Just because you can immediately see and understand the presence of ads doesn't mean their tax on your brain is any better (or more perceivable) than a miner on your cpu. Maybe firefox could add a warning about how ads impact your focus and productivity on sites that have ads as well.

Man, the "shapeshifting" in that medium article is so weak and impractical that you are probably better off actually shapeshifting into a privacy coin.

It's not really malware though. It doesn't steal your identity or your bank details, the downside is really limited to possibly slowing done your device temporarily. It's the difference between a tax on your attention or your cpu cycles. Plus there are some ads that contain actual malware. Better to lose a few hashes than your entire bitcoin wallet.

Would you say most websites today steal your data by tracking you or steal your attention with ads? Perhaps overly indulgent javascript elements of the site are stealing your cpu cycles as well? When TPB states clearly that by viewing the site you agree to support it financially by running a mining script are you stealing from them by blocking the script?

\&gt;send bitcoins to "bad" address
Yep still working.

That doesn't achieve any more than the transaction bouncing performed by OP initially. All the deposit addresses will end up grouped together at some point by the site owner.

In the fiat system fungibility is regulated by law. In a permissionless system that's not the case. If you want to make sure you're not caught up in problems relating to your txs somewhere down the line you are responsible for that.

Sure, I wouldn't want to be relying on that either.
