"Hmm, help to advance Bitcoin into real life applications or spend an extra minute to walk inside...."

God damn do they stick you with a heavy fee percentage though. I was going to place a cash deposit and they wanted ~30% of my money. Edit: Disregard, I was depositing over their weekly limit.

Just noticed my problem, I was trying to deposit over their $500 weekly limit.

Everyone buy! The market is stable!
But for real, I sold at $173 last week in a panic after waking up to my bitcoin alarm thinking I was going to buy back in cheaper :(. I await the next bubble pop.

That wasn't working when we needed it most and BTC hit $500~ just 20-30 minutes ago.
Coinbase has just shown they aren't reliable when we need instant BTC during a crash.

Coinbase is not an exchange.
Sign up at an exchange and have your fiat ready for times like this.

A hoarded asset is really all it's used for right now, people investing on the volatility of the market.
I see Bitcoin as a step in the right direction, but we still need a better solution.

Tuesday meaning tomorrow?

I don't agree with the rest of your theory, but this seams like a pretty feasible option. Although, couldn't you just use PGP key A to log in and PGP key B to communicate?

Until someone with a massive holding decides to crash the market to buy cheaper coins.
I'd say we're definitely in a bubble and it could happen any minute now. But it will probably happen once we've seen the price plateau for about 12 hours, whatever $ amount that might be.

My gut has not been allowing me to get to sleep for my programming class tomorrow morning. 
I'm hoping the guys on the east coast will wake up to a stabilized $180 and decide to continue holding.

Localbitcoins.com has been down for site maintenance since yesterday as well.
Coinbase/Bitstamp/Localbitcoins all unavailable to purchase btc atm.

Look at the BitWasp project, it's very similar to what you're talking about.
Edit: But yes, I'd be very interested. Ebay taking 10% and PayPal taking 3.5% makes me cringe every time I have to use Ebay.

Took them 3-4 days to show up in my bank account when I sold earlier this month

As I was finishing my chinese food, I told my fortune cookie to tell me something about my insecurity in buying right now.
Fortune cookie reads: You will succeed in making a small fortune by investing in a business project.
Just traded my car in for a Schwinn.
(but really, the fortune cookie said that)

I'll use it as a currency when it's not so volatile. Until then, it's a means of investing. 
I'm a working college student, when I graduate and get a job I'll be more inclined to aid the cause and use it as currency.

Bitcoinium, definitely. You can set high/low alarms for all of the markets.
Although, be very careful of your actions when you wake up in a groggy and panicked state. Back when we took the dip from $205-$170 I sold at $173 thinking I'd buy back in cheaper, but the market stabilized. I still made money, but I didn't double my money like I could have tonight.
