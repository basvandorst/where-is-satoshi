I’m lucky to be in a green country surrounded by all the yellows and reds. Considering we are still a monarchy-ish state and have had the highest numbers of coups in the past 100 years.

US stock market or global stock market?

It drives me crazy to see 9.9 BTC in my wallet and not a nice round number of 10
@_date: 2018-08-18 11:32:27
You’ll probably be buying it for 0.00016 BTC by then
@_date: 2018-08-26 05:19:16
Eventually I did, bought an additional 0.1 BTC at ATH -.-

They also have the English version
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:01:55
No it isn’t. It’s on the official SEC website, both in Thai and in English.
The translation is accurate too. I’m half Thai.
But the the op tittle is misleading.

Hodl every signal bitcoin out there, then the world would be fighting for only a few hundred Bitcoins in circulation making it 100m $ a Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-06 09:41:04

@_date: 2019-02-18 04:05:31

XZC opened on the BX Thailand exchange on the morning of 13th November (THB/XZC pair) causing a panic buy by placing orders at 'market price'. What those noobs don't know is that there were a bunch of sell orders on the excess of 100$, 1000$ $10000 $30000 sneakily waiting for them.
