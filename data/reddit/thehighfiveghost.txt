Sorry, for context  ~165000 Naira (Nigeria's Currency) is $1000. Also many African currencies are exceptionally volatile, more so even than Bitcoin is currently.

[Mist]( is our own application browser created in-house by the Go-lang team in Amsterdam :)
Check out the code on [GitHub](
It's pretty awesome.
did an incredible job on the UI.

They were so highly rated by everyone. I've used them as my go to exchange for a while, but as you say, I'm not dealing with this. 
Their PR was almost perfect till now. Not a fan of the new fee structure either. 
If you want more money Kraken, try working to increase your volume by bringing in new business, not hurting your current customers.

It does kind of hurt my eyes though... 
The sentence "I'm going to cook. Grandma, want some?" can have severely different implications without proper punctuation -  "im going to cook grandma want some?".

Not everyone in Africa is as poor as you think, for instance the average wage in Nigeria is around £3000 dollars a month!

Hello Check out our main [GitHub]( page, it might surprise how much we've already accomplished :)
We're currently on our 7th Proof of Concept. You can play around with it and make your own smart contract by following this [tutorial]( if you'd like to, everything can be run on our test net.
We intend to release the genesis block for Ethereum towards the end of the Q1 2015, so not long to go now.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:17:58
Here's a [tutorial]( for building Ethereum's "PoC 7" and creating your first smart contract.
Let me know if you need any assistance :)

That was scary. Wont be leaving ANY funds on Kraken any more.

On an £89.96 purchase (which is already £14.60 more expensive than if the product was priced in dollars...) there is a further £16.93 for shipping and £19.16 for duties and taxes bringing the total cost to £126.05 ($208.99 total where it would have been $127.94 total inc shipping if I lived in the USA).
Not great value at all for me unfortunately :(
Also the title is very misleading, Bitcoin is NOT now accepted for international payments, it will be on the 1st of September though.
Edit: though if all of your money is tied up in BTC, it does offer a useful service if you are willing to pay a premium.

A few of businesses on Ethereum:
* [Airlock]( - a IoT (Internet of Things) company implementing a decentralised generalist locking system.
* [CubeSpawn]( - a FMS (flexible manufacturing system) offering big factory automation to small shops.
* [Project Ðouglas]( - Builds DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations) and applications as well as the tools to build them.
* [Crypto Swartz]( - A tag-based backend reputation system for online content.
Edit: Also IBM/Samsung's [Adept]( is a fork of an early Ethereum Proof of Concept release.

Hi there This [video]( offers a pretty good introduction to what we're are trying to achieve.
The [white paper]( explains this in greater detail.

[Coinffeine]( will be a pretty cool p2p BTC exchange when it's done. They're using [Gossip Protocol]( which is a pretty eloquent solution for matching buy/sell orders etc.
Also, it's worth checking out [EtherEx]( which is being created on (surprise surprise) Ethereum.

Ethereum has a clear goal: delivering stable protocols and secure software upon genesis block release. 
We call on the crypto community and all bug bounty hunters to help us deliver flawless protocols and clients. 
Earn cold hard cash for finding a vulnerability, and get a place on our leaderboard, as well as a personal entry in the Ethereum genesis block.

In order to be able to proceed with a speedier and safer Frontier launch, we are currently actively encouraging everyone to help us conduct a public stress test of the Ethereum Olympic test network. To that end, we are offering a 0.5 ETH per block mining reward (ie. ~10% of the mining reward of homestead) to everyone who mines a block on Olympic between block number 311,000 (now) and block number 360,000. Rewards will be automatic and administered by python script. Hence, if you have GPU miners available, now is the time to turn them on and test them.
A live-updated FAQ on mining on ethereum is available here: 
As a reminder, you can also get Olympic bounties of up to 2500 ETH by spamming the network with transactions, mining more blocks than anyone else, etc. See the blog post for more ideas ( 
If you want to win, don't do it by hand, write a bot! :)

Well, no. Why would Counterparty have forked Ethereum if smart contracts were available a year ago...?
Counterparty is a great project, but smart contracts is not something they have had in use for a year, or ever for that matter! They will eventually have smart contacts, but only because they are utilising the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
Bad quoting but still.
Ridiculous statement imo.

Ask to _NOT_ get directly paid in BTC. It's unfair for employees such as yourself to be exposed to the price volatility of Bitcoin, or any unstable crypto for that matter.

Hello :) 
Check this:

I think the idea of Ethereum is to get to a point where the protocol development can continue unhindered by squabbles about "new scripting opcodes and whatnot".
The issue today is that Bitcoin's development is, at best, glacial. Coupled with the fact that its iteration was the first of it's kind, it *needs* to be able to keep pace with all of the excellent research that is happening in the space.
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:17:50
Actually, no, it doesn't at all.
Still on their testnet. No word that they've got it working yet. Correct me if I'm wrong.

That's nothing, not even doubled! If Greeks were "rushing" to buy Bitcoin then that number would be in the 1000s.
Literally, 3 extra Greek people bought a Bitcoin...

But, Ethereum is Bitcoin 2.0?
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:31:32
I don't understand what the hell this is doing on the front of r/Bitcoin...
For a start, it's about "BCash".


The only purpose it serves is to cast Vitalik in a bad light and... **Oh.** I get it. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:43:28
Not if you're mining it...
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:08:35
Someone please tell me why this is considered relevant to r/bitcoin but Ethereum posts are not?
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:52:04
Would just like to point out the [UKDCA (United Kingdom Digital Currency Association)]( has been working tirelessly to inform and educate policy makers about crypto and it's potential in fintech. A lot of the intelligent regulation exists because of their work :)
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:12:53
Isn't Ethereum supposed to be off topic on r/Bitcoin?
Why hasnt this post been banned? Strange...

Judging by most posters, unfortunately not :P

Profit and mining efficiency are LOWERED when joining a mining pool.
@_date: 2015-09-22 10:17:40
The issue is the economics just don't work out... At all! [It would be more efficient to just load a raspberry pi with $200 of your favourite crypto tokens...](
Why is 21 overcharging the poor devs that want to innovate on the BTC stack? 


@_date: 2015-09-22 12:11:21
For me, if adoption of the technology is the real goal here, they should be selling it at either cost price of as a loss leader + opensourcing the OS. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 17:13:23
If you want the feeling of infiniteness, just have it hand the coins out on a slow exponential decay curve.
The miner they have on there now wouldn't even mine 1 Bitcoin after 3 YEARS of use. That's not event taking into account increase of the hashrate and halvening...
Still cheaper just to take a rasp pi and load it with 1 BTC....


If transfer of coins on Bitcoin is _confusing_ for the devs and enterpirses this Bitcoin computer is aimed at, then Bitcoin is a complete and utter failure.
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:18:17
For sure - but the point is, why charge people more money when there is a much more efficient way of giving people a similar (if not better!) way of engaging with Bitcoin???
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:29:02
What do you mean "when people start using it"? 
Last few days it's had over half the tx volume of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:19:43
Point is, they are charging devs more money than is required. They could deploy a similar tool with pre loaded BTC at a much, much lower cost, lowering the barrier for entry and increasing the overall amount of users. Surely that's the most important metric right now?
@_date: 2015-10-02 14:22:01
FYI by blockchain technology, they mean Ethereum.
Edit: It's being built out by a [ConsenSys]( formation, Ujo - 
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:16:40
Exactly u/TheTT.
Another point worth making is that Vitalik's statement is true regardless of the current ETH tx fee. 
&lt;5¢ is a _target_. 
Unsurprisingly, that target might not get hit all the time whilst scalability &amp; network adoption increase asynchronously.
Question: what is Bitcoin's target for a reasonable tx fee for the future? 
Edit: why is this post now locked?
@_date: 2015-10-02 15:49:33
That wallet is made by KryptoKit... Are they a scam?

See: Ethereum.
It had PoCs since almost day one yet still with was considered vapourware.

It's an interesting project, hopefully it will bring more developers on to the Ethereum tech stack in general. 
But yes, certainly not the end of Ethereum, especially if more people are incentivised to develop using Ethereum's core technologies.
