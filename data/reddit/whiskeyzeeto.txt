That's now how I remember it (especially about "majority"). Either one of us find some research on this topic or is just two guys saying how they remember things.


No. People here talk about the merits of bitcoin regardless of it being decentralized. I just conceded to another guy here (who is a lot more eloquent and pleasant to discuss than you) that if you want to send money to Lebanon, bitcoin could be a good option, but that has nothing to do with it being decentralized.
As for your last paragraph, that makes me wonder if I should even waste my time trying to have a discussion with you.
@_date: 2014-07-31 13:46:18
Let me just state the obvious first: I can't predict the future and maybe bitcoin will be great.
Now, for skeptic:
1. Bitcoin looks pretty useless, I just don't need it and I'm pretty sure 99% of people don't need it either. I already have more forms of payments than I need. I'm considering cancelling my credit card just because you can do anything with a debit card these days (when I first requetsed my credit card many web sites wouldn't accept debit cards). The only situation I can think of where bitcoins could be useful if for international money transfer (not payments to companies, cause they usually accept cards, but transfers to other people). But I never need to transfer money to people abroad and I believe few people need to. Maybe bitcoin will survive with a small share of these transations, but I don't think it will ever be mainstream and as I said, I personaly don't need to do international money transfer to other people.
2. Most people who like bitcoin don't even seem to like it because of the potential convenience, most people seem to be on it just to get rich if the price goes up and that looks like a bubble.
For hope it will fail:
3. That's more complicated. Basically many people seem to believe BTC will just take place of national currencies and that's what would be really bad. Government has to have power over currency to apply economic policies. If we leave it on the market's hand we will be leaving in the extreme wild capitalist society where the market can do anything and the government has little power to regulate. Now I'm capitalist, but I still believe the government has to have power to regulate. Greece gives an example of this sitation. They can't devaluate their currency in times of economic crisis because their currenty is the Euro. They would need support of the whole EU to devaluate the Euro... With BTC a country just completely loses control. The only alternative Greece has is to directly reduce people's earnings in Euros, which is much more complicated to do and creates a lot more resentment. Again, maybe you are in favor of "fuck the government let the market do what they want!", but I still believe some gorvernment intervention is important to avoid/solve economic problems.
4. If BTC is a bubble, better burst soon to avoid too many people caught on it.
@_date: 2014-12-03 16:57:04
It's funny how to keep people interested the promises for the future have to keep getting more and more extraordinary.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:53:15
1. Maybe bitcoin is a good option to send money to countries like Lebanon (I'll not bother investigating alternatives). Thanks for saying something realistic instead of fantasies about email being skeptically received in the 90's. Maybe bitcoin could have some use for a small niche of money transfers, because 99.9% of people don't need to send money abroad to a country like Lebanon. Also, I'm not going into what could happen with the costs of using bitcoin after miners stop getting new coins from mining... Not related, but I also think bitcoin could survive as a hobbyist thing, just like there is still people talking Esperanto even though it never really caught as the international language.
2. Here in the UK after you buy something online with your credit card you are redirected to a page from your credit card provider to type in your password, so there is not really a lot of trust there anymore. Perhaps in your country they don't do that... But trust when doing business will always be necessary. How can you guarantee, after you send some bitcoins to Microsoft, that they will really provide you the service you paid for? You have to trust them.

@_date: 2014-10-03 14:25:12
I'm not a BTC expert, but as far as I know there is a limit like 7 transactions/second globally. That is too low to make up for the costs. The bottom line is that the concept of "proof of work", which is in the very basis of BTC design, makes it very cost inefficient. So far it has been financed by people continually buying newly created BTC. Their money is going straight to huge electricity bills and equipment maintenance from miners (and their profits, of course).

There is no reason to believe this will cause the BTC value to go up and even if it does, that means transacting with BTC will be more expensive than transacting with dollars. You will have to pay like $7 worth of BTC per transaction. Pretty much any other form of payment will be cheaper. That should actually cause the price of a BTC to go down (nobody will use an expensive form of money transaction).

I'm not from Argentina, but my home country (Brazil) used to be in the same situation when I was a kid, in the 1980s and early 1990s. I saw currency name changes with zeros being cut many times (Cruzeiro to Cruzeiro Novo to Cruzado to Cruzado Novo and back to Cruzeiro). Our inflation reached 50% per month (that's right, MONTH). Our government worked on it and today inflation is around 6% per year. The first point I want to make here is that bitcoin, which is still an experiment, is not a substitute for government policy. Second point is that your presentation seems to be out of date. Inflation rate in Argentina is around 10%, not 40%. Third point: when a country has very high inflation rate the government usually keeps interest rates high so people with money on the bank don't lose value of their money. Argentina's interest rate today is 15%, so people with money on the bank are not losing the value of their money. Finally, inflation is bad and I experienced the worst of it when I was a kid in Brazil (50% per month is about 12900% per year, much worse than Argentina's 10%), but that just doesn't justify betting your money on experimental bitcoins. If you are so crazy desperate, at least buy something that has been around forever like gold or for a long time like dollar.

Genuinely curious: who told you, back in the 90's, that they didn't see the reason for email? I remember people being baffled by emails. I remember people assuming regular mail would just disappear. I don't remember anyone not being amazed by it. Even my mother who couldn't use a computer would be impressed to know what emails were.
And just to complete, people here like to talk about bitcoin as if it was the first time money became digital. Money has been digital for decades now. We also have paper money, which is good to have, but I believe most money transactions have been made electronically for quite some time.

I didn't know about the restrictions, but I find it hard to believe that there are many funds out there willing to invest in it. It's probably just a tiny little fraction that are willing to take the risk. On top of that most funds are oriented to some kind of investment, you put your money on some "East Asian" fund that focus on investments in East Asian or you put your money on a "mining funds" that focus on the mining industry and so on or an FTSE 100 tracker fund that tries to track what the FTSE 100 index is doing. Very few funds are completely free for the fund manager to do whatever he wants. In other words, for a fund manager to put money in bitcoins he/she will have to open a new fund that clearly includes bitcoins as a potential asset to invest and wait for customers to put their money on it, so it's not so simple at all.

So one of these 3 things must happen:
1. Transaction fees go up so they cover the cost that used to be covered by new coins.
2. Transaction volume goes up so that with the same fees we have today we cover the costs. (I'm not sure about this one, wouldn't transactions volume increase somehow also increase the overall cost of miners?)
3. Hashrate, therefore difficulty and therefore mining cost goes down.

So you are using the wrong terminology. Free trade is not about money transfer, is about buy and selling. I don't know where you are and how things work where you are, but I'll use the UK as an example: if I buy something from abroad, say the USA, regardless of how I pay (credit card, bitcoin, doesn't matter), when I go collect the parcel at the Royal Mail they will say "well, this came from the USA, your import tax is X much". That's it, bitcoin doesn't change anything.
I don't pay fees to use my credit card inside my country and pay little fees to use it abroad (little to no fees), so credit card is also frictionless.

Did you notice the address where you find your "porn" inside Pi is actually bigger than the porn itself? You need to transmit more information to give someone the address than to just give them the porn itself. That's because you're not really storing anything in Pi, you're just trying to find patterns' in randomness. Very different from the blockchain where there is literally child pornography stored there.
