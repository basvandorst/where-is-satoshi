There are two answers to this question.
The first is that you cannot change bitcoin, and that anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar. This school of thought says that bitcoin is what Satoshi said it was, plus/minus some conventions/protocol stuff that he never addressed in his paper (specific wire formats, rules for the DHT, etc).
The second school of thought is that if "enough" people adopt a change, then the change has been adopted and that's all there is to it. There may still be a minority group of people sticking with the "original," and at that point it becomes a fight over the name, the spirit of the movement, and the minds of the users.
There are a few groups which are well-poised to make significant, widely-adopted changes. The core developers obviously are on that list, as are the large mining pools. These groups have different kinds of power: for instance, the core developers can change what sorts of messages their client relays, while the miners can change what sorts of messages make it into the block chain.
From the perspective of the 1st school of thought, if one of these groups tried to change bitcoin, they'd be no different than the people mining other altcoins.
From the perspective of the 2nd school of thought, if one of these groups tried to change bitcoin and had some traction, then market forces may require people to adopt the change, for fear of their non-modified coin becoming worthless.
An interesting conundrum really.

This does not strike me as a good use of satellite technology. Satellites are not indelible, as you seem to think. Certainly they can be engineered to survive for several years, even a couple of decades, but that's not what you're talking about doing. And you've already got plans to appeal to the masses for funding, as though there was a problem on the horizon which we must bind-together to solve.
Truthfully if the plan is to crowd-source funding to solve bitcoin-related problems, I'd say there are more terrestrial concerns which should first be addressed. Such as, for instance, the shortage of full nodes, and the domination of the mining by the bitcoin oligarchs (ghash).

No offense, but you are bad at dealing with trolls.

Also need to prove they keep backups, and prove their source code doesn't contain any bugs which might erase funds, and prove that they are actually running the source. All of which they could do on their own, but....

I think many of us have observed that it'd be nice if Bitcoin's scripting engine were actually a thing, rather than a kluge.

That would literally be a Ponzi scheme.

Man, everyone should issue a joint statement or something.

Is there a chapter on how to vouch for multiple failed exchanges?

Bitcoin was useful because it got people interested in crypto currencies. Glad to see we're evolving towards something with mass-adoption potential.

Because being "bitcoin rich" doesn't translate into having real buying power, unless you want overstock merchandise or cheap electronics.

This actually worked, I can't believe it.

Student outreach should be your primary goal. Since it's a university, it'd make sense to focus on the technical and economic aspects, and maybe less on the cult and revolution aspects.
Then again, universities love cults and revolutions, so maybe I have it backwards?
Either way well done, hope it works out well.

I was mocking the developers, who had initially dismissed it as not-a-bug.

A doge giveaway would be fun. But remember 1 doge = 1 doge!

TX malleability isn't a bug, it's a known issue that everyone should just work around. Oh but here's a fix for this bug. I mean non-bug.
