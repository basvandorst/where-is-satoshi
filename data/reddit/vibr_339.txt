If Satoshi would wake up from coma today, he/she/they would immediately find Bitcoin address space and chain compatible to the first implementation. Original coins can be directly sent to a segwit address. 
Bcash however would be incompatible.

No problem. I like to take concerns seriously. If nothing else I have an opportunity to review and organise my own knowledge by writing it down, and then perhaps lure someone out to expand on that or correct something that I missed. This is the way to learn, I think, and it benefits all.  
For me it doesn’t matter if the original question is trolling or not. Good information needs to be out there.
I understand the doubts too, but giving up to the negativity is not good. It’s often better to stay silent instead then (and maybe think oneself where does that negativity actually comes from) than to add noise to the discussion. There are a lot of people who are new to Bitcoin. I wouldn’t want them to feel threatened.

No, it does not make the network more vulnerable. So called LN is basically a set of multi signature Bitcoin transactions. It very cleverly uses what’s already available. LN security is based on 100% what Bitcoin offers, which is the best there is. 
What comes to financial privacy LN augments Bitcoin, and it for instance technically enables absolute anonymity, if one wishes. 
So, the network is not made more vulnerable, but of course what comes to users’ funds it is up to themselves and app developers how vulnerable they are. That’s not different from how it is today though - from traditional banking and transacting to crypto.  
There are not too many unresolved issues. There are unresolved issues which are being worked on. LN is not an impossible task, and it is already largely functional and also in use at many places. It is the will of a huge number of developers and commercial and non-commercial entities to improve LN and make it better.

Well, in the extreme case the only way to be financially private is to not have any finances at all. Anything beyond that is a compromise.
If one wishes to conceal ownership of any commodity or an object of value, or live in a shadow economy there are ways to do that - in crypto too.

Well, that has actually happened. There was a scam where people would buy things while on plane, and the payments via their credit cards were only rejected when the plane landed. At this point the persons were far away. 
This could be mitigated by having a local server perhaps, and in BTC you’d have wallets that could connect locally with each other. The settlement would happen as soon as there’s connection to the blockchain. This is also possible via satellite these days, so that’s one way.
If your wallet doesn’t keep track of funds I don’t think it would have many users too...

Sorry to hear that. It’s your fault however. When in the final steps of your plan I suggest you to think things a bit over though, once more.
Nobody is forcing you to act. It’s all in your mind. 
Life and universe are larger than petty things on Earth. It’s not healthy to have your personal growth to be dictated by material things. Right now you’re blaming an abstract entity of your own misery. Do you think that’s wise. Is that how, and who you really are?
It seems that you have let your guard down. 
Think what is important in your life, and who are important people in your life. Isn’t it time to focus on your passions and the people, at the time of misery? 
You are in an illusion that outside forces dictate your life. You are a strong person and you have the power to be happy, and gain happiness. If you feel you are too weak at the moment, ask for help. Let go of your pride, be humble.  You can gain control. 
Start by small things, small steps. You may think you have no time for your talent, but that’s not true. You don’t need to finish anything today. 
I’ve been in your situation work wise. My simple plan each day is to do something at some of my own projects, how ever little that is. That way, each day I reward myself and things will be finished eventually. Right now I’m mostly freelancing, and I can balance my work with my passions better.
You feel like a young person still. Life is more than you and I can comprehend. Give it an opportunity to surprise you. You and I, and all people make mistakes. Learn and do things better next time. Leave things at better condition than what they were.
There’s no golden ticket to anywhere. If you let yourself grow, you will gain freedom, and be what you really are. Growing is not easy. but it is what makes you your unique self. Embrace that, not the human reality, there’s your power.
Regarding your current investment, just HOLD

Essentially, it won't be different from owning shares etc.
There's no way Bitcoin will ever be mainstream without legislation governing it. This is US government adopton of bitcoin etc, so to speak, trying to catch up with the developments in recent years. This will lay foundations for the businesses to come.

Well, most of the users will not probably care about privacy so much as utility, like it is today with payments. 
Bitcoin has always been pseudonymous, but nowadays transactions can be made anonymous by routing them via lightning network for instance. Payment endpoints do not have to know about each other. A system and a method can be set up to make transactions completely untraceable. One could say LN is the privacy layer Bitcoin never had in the first place.
A timing analysis can still be done though: 
The more complex the route the more difficult that analysis would be, perhaps even impossible in all practical sense at some level?
Privacy (and trust) regarding Bitcoin goes many ways. In one way it is to preserve individual freedom, and in other way it is a selling point to integrate and replace existing payment methods with the bitcoin protocol. The trick is to not tamper with the inherent privacy properties of the protocol, and to make it adaptable and modular for wide set of applications built on top of it. The applications can then have different desirable levels of privacy, and the users are free to choose the service they like.
As a side note it's interesting that BCH is removing random relay delays from the protocol in a coming version for their pursuit of on-chain scaling, even though those delays are built in to prevent time based transaction analysis. Tells even more how lost their cause is in preserving 'Satoshi's vision".

Nothing in that indicates one should hold (or sell).

I fail to see that it's anything spectacular, but a normal occurrence when some event that might take place. It's index of interest over time, and not a prediction. One well placed ad or social media manipulation can create peak interest.

For an outsider the system would seem like amazing waste of resources for something to satisfy a very few. It virtually doesn't have any practical purpose.

Well anyway, if the aliens are benevolent players they'll be probably able to connect their hyper adapting systems to the network and dominate it. Sightseeing the world with free money, for the benefit of natives, who wouldn't do that?

There might be a speculative pump/dump at the time, but if these instruments get approved the funds will seek for longer term returns. The expectations of this ETF happening is surely in some way priced in already, which would lead in a steep dump also for a while, if the uncertainty goes on.
The more capital in the Bitcoin ecosystem the more rigid fundamentals though - enough of shared interest so in longer term things should follow stable trajectory. But, if Bitcoin would share the leverage potential of gold for instance there might be long bear markets too...
I always recommend people to cost average their BTC buys. It's a sane long term strategy in a market which is hard to predict, but which has a lot of unrealized potential.

Without being part of governmental framework and legislation bitcoin will never gain wide public acceptance, and the adaptation levels will stay low. 
Bitcoin is still in its very early stages. 
Virtually no one is interested, even though headlines are made, because bitcoin lacks legality and trust in the eyes of the public.

Competition is not in the block size but in the features. 
In many ways Bitcoin has already been behind alts. Segwit and LN and such derivatives will bring similar and new features to Bitcoin., than its 'competitors '. 
One could say that there actually isn't any competition. Cryptos are all part of the same financial revolution. In the end, the feature sets will be shared to a large extent, and there already are multi currency wallets...

It appears that core is pursuing a more modular and user sourced model whereas unlimited is pursuing server sourced model. 
I'd expect the user sourced model to win, because of its versatility and open interface. 
The miners play the role or the internet backbone and server administration, either way. In the terms of finances the model really doesn't matter. Money will flow in regardless. More interfaces mean more business opportunities however, the trickles will be many for the miners too. 
What miners should realise is that if they want to survive in the long run it'll never be about the fee economy by itself. What any sane business person would do is to branch into new ventures and expand the scope of services. 
Block size increase will happen. More interfaces are needed anyway. The whole debate is a bit unnecessary. It's about the order of things rather than one or the another (some power mongering aside...).

LN is an instant and secure transaction layer built on Bitcoin. It uses Bitcoin and its features as the base layer. LN will enable Bitcoin to scale many orders of magnitude (for everyday use), without compromising the security and the decentralisation principles on which Bitcoin has been developed. The way LN works makes transacting on BTC very cheap, almost free. 
It’s still in the beta stage. It’s advisable to wait for the familiar wallet apps to enable LN features. When LN is mature enough its use is as straightforward and invisible as using any BTC wallet. 
If you want to dip in there already exists wallets and apps to transact using LN, but they require some extra work and dedication to be usable. Also transactions on LN may not be safe enough at the moment.

The table is misleading. Because the chains are separate there’s no point counting the features  together, and then calculate relative shares from that.
That table would have some meaning if all those projects were implementations on the same chain. Dropping the relative percentage numbers would improve the table a lot. 
Basically you could add any project there, not just bitcoin and its forks. The table in a way skews the reality, and arbitrarily gives a lot of importance to only certain projects. 
 
Also, comparing number of nodes is meaningless in a way that the absolute number which would be considered good is not the same for all of the projects. Maybe that should be node count /  usage  or something like that?

I’d say the task to have large scale payment processing using Bitcoin is on its way, but it’s a lot of work and effort to get there. 
In the early days community was small so it felt like things moved fast and everybody was in it. Now the community is really large so it feels like less is happening, even though the opposite is true.  A lot of capital is at work to develop practical solutions. 
Bitcoin is a platform. The platform has many uses, and one of them is the everyday use as cash. So far the the best solution is Lightning Network. Many other uses cases can be covered by building a layer on Bitcoin. I expect that at some point some current alt-coin / blockchain startup takes the first step and moves over to build their thing as s layer on BTC. 
Most people seem to be waiting for the developers to develop and investors to invest. This is happening at an increasing pace.

Perhaps it would be useful to come up with some other metric than US dollar. The typical reference point is also often western, even though being “rich” and something having “value” is very relative to external and other conditions.  
So, how much is bitcoin in bitcoins? Some kind of multidimensional index where usability, usefulness etc???? are combined into one could be more suitable to estimate the “worthiness” of Bitcoin.
At the moment I estimate that index to be close to zero, or somewhere between 0-5 perhaps?

In reality, today things are less complicated. There are multitude of ways to deal with bitcoin and other cryptos by just pushing a few buttons on a phone app. That in comparison to the early days when all of the transactions happened at command line level.
How often do you manually send/receive/route your data packets? Never, I hope for the sake of your sanity. What really happens is that you stare at some downloading indicator while the magic happens somewhere else, and you definitely do not need to think about the mechanics. Things just happen.
What we are now seeing with Lightning are the early days. In the end you’ll have an app that takes care of almost everything for you, and all you’ll see are few options, toggles and buttons.
Bitcoin ref code version number is soon 0.16. Not 1.0. We are still in the very early days, and the technological groundwork is being constantly improved. Simple block size increase is not enough. Block size will surely be just a variable, not a constant in the future. While we are getting there a lot of ingenious things are implemented, to really push the development at the best possible manner, to really get everything out of the resources at hand. 
Last and not the least, the development is kept in line with the idea of decentralization and all the things bitcoin as an idea is based on. That’s a careful process, which is easily lost when one only stares at the price. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:22:05
That's true, in that case. If the aim is to save one's own ass and personal wealth what I said applies. This is most likely the scenario that many of the leaders now face, in parallel of what's happening on the nation's economy, which still functions on a different paradigm.

$10 worth of bitcoin in 2010
To illustrate just how impressive this rally has been, let's say you had the foresight (or good luck) to purchase $10 worth of bitcoin at the time the first bitcoin exchange opened in March 2010. Based on the $0.003 per-coin price at the time, your $10 would have purchased 3,333 bitcoins.  
Now, using the $3,722 current value of a bitcoin and the $445 value of one bitcoin cash, your original investment would be worth a total of nearly $13.9 million. That translates to a 655% annualized gain over a roughly seven-year period.
What's more, keep in mind that someone paid 10,000 bitcoin, or three times this amount, for just two pizzas earlier that same year.

Block size is only one part of the equation.

How about obvious more numerous interconnected hubs, which in essence is a decentralised network of hubs (and users). 
When the network grows there won’t be single points of failure like how LN looked like in the beginning. That development is obvious.

I have formed my opinion on following 2X GitHub and development (not many participating there), and how the leaders of that movement present themselves. Even talking about ‘leaders’ in connection with the Bitcoin development make me shudder.
Concentration of the power should be avoided.
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:57:29
By all metrics there’s no need to raise block size as soon as it is now planned. Block size is not even the issue here, capacity is. 2X solves a problem that is not there, and it is also just a partial solution, rushed into existence. Original segwit documentation provides a well thought out plan how to deal with capacity needs (Raising actual block size included). Disregarding that is not wise.
After the hard fork, if 2X succeeds, the development would be in the hands of only few individuals and corporations. That’s unlike anything at the moment, after all, if one really studies the situation.
In technical terms, we are talking about rushed development in order to achieve less secure and less open system.

At least it seems to play out an often seen pattern in pump and dump coins. Some people still trying to make profits here and there, while overall trend is bearish. If past would be indicative of the future, and looking at the chart would reveal something...
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:16:20
That’s true, I didn’t think of that. 
At least Xapo is consistent in their policy. With BCH it was also about the difficulty: 
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:10:26
The kind of dynamic limiting is what is proposed, a weighted average of the elements which make a block, however large it may be. 
I think the hard limit is there in the original code, because it was found to be the most suitable one. Most likely simulations and tests were run to find the parameters. That’s how hard limits are found, through research and experiment, or from mathematic formulas. Unless it’s about a policy, which I doubt in this case.
To extend, there’s an universal constant, the speed of light, which restricts the global transaction number to a certain limit. It’s impossible to relay data at certain volumes, because of the distances and the capacity of the network - even if all connections would use lasers.

@_date: 2017-09-29 13:30:20
Simple block size increase is not enough. The capacity increase is. Segwit documentation provides a plan to increase the capacity dynamically, and with better choices for the miners for instance. 
Block size increase is a very simplistic view of the whole problem. It’s tailored to be simplistic, because the actual problem is hard to explain. Harder to rally troops behind a difficult concept. 
Perhaps you should read about what’s actually the problem and the solution for it here. For me this sounds very reasonable:
What we are now seeing is an appropriation of the well thought out plan, in order to centralise the power and wealth in the hands of few individuals. 
Should all follow the original plan, everyone would benefit. Larger blocks will happen, and the fees are getting lower. 
There’s no need to be theatrical about it.
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:55:27
Yes. That's why they'd set as low fee as possible for their transaction. Quoting static numbers is a weak argument, because the fees are anything but static. 
At the moment it's a compromise of time and value, but transactions will get instant. 
Nowadays I always set the fee as small as possible in the clients I use (sadly, in the apps I use there's no way to set the fee by hand), and the txs are practically always confirmed in the next block. 
Things will only get better, and the tech will mature to encompass wider set of use cases. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:52:24

On BCH Xapo also stated they will support the blockchain with the most difficulty.
I totally agree B2X will mess things up badly.  Coercion by the ‘money party’ is not what Bitcoin is about.

Banks will not die or go away because of Bitcoin. They will adopt blockchain tech to cut the middle operators out between banks (and customers). A lot of law firms and paper pushers will have to adapt or learn a new job. Banks are able to automate large parts of their business by using smart contracts for instance. Things that used to take days will happen in seconds.
This will enable instant crowd sourced capital and fluid micro financing, with some return to the loan givers (bank customers). This capital the banks will be able to use as a leverage for larger loans and other operations.
Sure there will be disrupting companies that act like banks, but there will also be amended regulations for the new business models and the modern economy. Most likely many of those companies will be bought by bigger operators.
Things will get more instantaneous and decentralized, but the back end will still be there...
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:41:05
I don’t see anything wrong with what they’ll do. Their reasoning might be off but they are very helpful. When BCH forked they provided a way to easily sell them for BTC. Very handy. It’s similar now. 
B2X will not succeed. If you have BTC in your Xapo wallet you will be able to dump B2X at some point, by tapping your phone a couple of times. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:02:54
The plan is not being followed. It’s being hijacked. 2X is in the hands of very few individuals and corporations, who are not open about their intentions, and who use unfair practices to push their agenda.
The difference is in the execution, and how it’s handled.
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:29:20
You are exaggerating a bit there. 
The developers agree with you that LN is not ready. It was less ready two years ago. Four years ago it was non existent. 
Now main net is online for the brave to dip in, and merchants and service providers are joining forces to build things on LN. 
There’s nothing underwhelming in LN at the moment. It’s beta and it’s getting better every day. That’s simply how it is.
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:10:36
Some suggestions. 
Every process should have max three steps. 
Promote engagement by asking to scan a qr code of a friend. 
Create a share option in the app for spreading the app further. 
Have two modes: pilot mode (guided) and hero mode (guide elements not shown, free navigation)
Break the app to few levels. Novice, intermediate, advanced. Completing a task in one level takes the user to the next. 
Keep it simple!

Bitcoin, BTC, is the original one. 
You can send bitcoins back and forth the earliest addresses ever and the current ones. 
Bitcoin Cash coins can only be sent to BCH addresses. BCH has been around since 2017. If one sends BTC to BCH address the coins will be lost. They are based on different blockchain.
BCH is a fork of Bitcoin, not a split. It's based on Bitcoin, but with different rules, which are incompatible with Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is one of many projects which are forks of Bitcoin. Before Bitcoin Cash there were Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited etc, which are all failed attempts to grab power from Bitcoin, by the about the same people who are now behind Bitcoin Cash. They have made a lot money to the project leaders though. BCH for instance, created as much BCH as anyone had BTC at the time of the fork.
Some people have lost coins because of the address mismatch and the fraudulent behaviour of the main BCH promoter, bitcoin.com.

Yes. Let’s establish a Linux Cash fork, and make it incompatible with Linux apps. Then start a campaign that Linux Cash is Linux, and deliberately confuse current and would-be users about it by having the domain name linux.com. 
What term would you use to describe the Linux Cash main promoter?
I’m sure Linus Torvals would find many and get on the news again. 
But instead, this time it’s the users and not a single entity who’s angry and want the fraudulent practice to stop. 
It’s actually sad that Bitcoin Cash has to so seriously freeload on Bitcoin, and it seemingly cannot sustain by itself as a concept.

SegWit is an on-chain improvement on Bitcoin. It's not a different chain. Bitcoins since the beginning can be transferred back and forth the current chain.

Yes, his answer was really great. I don’t understand the criticism here.  Besides it’s comforting to know that he actually knows about cryptos, and he’s not just making up some vague answer about it. It doesn’t matter if Bitcoin goes to one million euros or whatever, it’s still a risky asset without macroeconomic implications - unless there’s a strong political drive to integrate Bitcoin in the system as an essential part. That may well happen later. Bitcoin could be the foundation of many applications, but what comes to the actual utility it’s generally no better than what’s available today. One can buy stuff and send and receive money using an app in an instant without cryptos. As a replacement for a native currency the actual use cases are few, and it’s a niche at a global scale.

I started monthly savings about a year ago. Around 50 to 100 euros / month. I'm treating this as a high risk long term investment/savings. I'm keeping some of the BTC as 'cash', and I'm buying physical coins when I can (with BTC), to be my cold storage wallets and to have interesting collectibles around.
For the whole year the profit has been about 60%. I didn't look for such a rise in value though, and realistically I'm not seeing that to continue year after year. I expect (hope) the trajectory to be steady in the long term, and I'm looking for at least similar returns than in the stock market. The monthly buys even the volatility out nicely anyway.
Buying BTC brings more value in the system, which is always good.
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:45:34
Maybe that would need rewording. Bitcoin drives the development of more energy efficient ASICs / related technologies. Even though the energy consumption is not a problem they portray it to be, it still is a big factor in mining profitability. Also, for the network security mining should be geographically decentralized as well as possible. Clusters around power plants are fine, but not when most of them are in China for example. Mining should not be energy intensive. Making mining more efficient creates new markets for miners.
There will most likely be continuous downward trend in BTC energy consumption regardless of short term market action. There’s a lot to achieve in hardware design, and there’s constant financial demand for that. This is unlike traditional mining etc, which cannot be squeezed so much because the machines are at different scale. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:11:13
That’s about 25€ to 50€ / month depending on the operator and the 4G bandwidth chosen (100 to 600). I see one offering 600 MBit/s  unlimited connection at 49.99 for example, including all Nordic and Baltic countries. There are lower rates for fixed period contracts available. This a heavily competed area of business, because for example changing the operator is made really easy. Capping the connection would deter a lot of customers.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:47:22
Decentralized exchange maybe? [ or similar ([ ?). If you by anonymous mean no KYC... If you use a card or a bank transfer there’s a mark somewhere about your activities. Maybe combine a decentralized exchange with Monero. Bisq uses Tor by default for connections. It’s a local app on you machine or device and it’s peer to peer, and no one else knows anything (~~and peers only transact and don’t know each other either.~~ \- actually this is not true, sorry. I haven’t used Bisq, but it appears users will know each other, in case of direct bank transfers for instance)
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:50:57
Actually, no one can know that. With LN there can literally be thousands of transactions in a single transaction on the base layer. No one can count them though. The data of  your transactions on LN is only available for you basically, and if you want to share financial data it’s up to you to do that. 
What I like about the complete offering is that everyone can freely choose their level of financial privacy. 
Some LN operators like businesses will maybe share their statistics, from which an estimation could be done. 
But then again, when one can create a totally private, invisible and anonymised transaction network on LN some or a sizeable portion (who knows?) of data is always missed.
