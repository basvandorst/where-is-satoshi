I'm a Nationwide member and have managed to get money out of coinbase via revolut... Received the money in Euros to my revolut account, converted to to GBP (free to do) and sent a faster payment to NBS.
The transfer from coinbase to revolut too about 7 working days in the end. Revolut to NBS took about 15 minutes.
There are incentives for inviting people to join, 3 signups allows you to hold cryptocurrency on their platform, haven't tried it yet as I've not invited enough ;)
You've got to check out Revolut - it's saved me a fortune in hidden banking fees! 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:00:40
Yeah, perfect, took a while to get from coinbase to revolut but all fine

But it's very clear that you don't even understand BTC so you cannot be making informed decisions.

Great for BTC but surely he isn't blind to the idiocy of this.

Only an idiot would get paid in bitcoin, you're adding layers to the thread to deter from the fact that you don't know how life works...
How can these be bought in bitcoin?
Can they be instantly liquidated? 
Why would you be paid normally and buy bitcoin? It's ridiculous.
I hope neither of you have any responsibilities, although the OP and your replies answer that for me

I opened an account today (I'm from the UK too) and, after some initial difficulty, managed to send a payment to Coinbase.
So I deposited in GBP &gt; transferred to Euros (free) &gt; sent a SEPA payment (free) to coinbase.
Said it should be received by Thursday, I'll then transfer it all the way back to revolut, convert back to GBP and back to my bank account, to test it all works.

Not sure number 2 is worthy advice, setting stops will ensure you're consistently stopped out by extreme volatility.  Much like Whales take advantage of now.

It's the same answer, if we knew what was happening next, we'd all be rich. After playing around few a few months I'd suggest just keeping it in bitcoin and adding to it periodically

So you're comparing bitcoin power consumption with murder... Using your own analogy.
So are you concerned with the spiralling usage of Xboxes?
Especially as there are millions more in the world than BTC mining processors.
You're embarrassing yourself.

As soon as I can pay off my mortgage and buy and Alfa Romeo 4c, I'm out too... But for that I'll need BTC to be $1,000,000...
Unless I keep buying like OP says :)

They won't diminish in fiat value if the growth continues
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:58:52
how'd that work out?!
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:57:15
Is this what it has come to?
But funny.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:10:53
Testing a method...
Using the trailing stop and buying back after initial upward trends.  I was using paint to annotate this, so buys and sells were triggered when the price went a crosshairs width in the other direction.
Green lines indicate a position taken and red are the trailing stop has being triggered.
The price is in USD and I’d calculate that using this method would equate to 1.4% growth within that 90 minute period.
That’s worked out as $108 profit per BTC, dividing it by the end price of $7500… that calculation might be one that makes no sense so I’m happy to reconsider that…
Buy	7467
Sell	7497
	+30
Buy	7456
Sell	7473
	+17
Buy	7457
Sell	7456
Buy	7440
Sell	7472
	+32
Buy	7472
Sell	7490
	+28
	
Total	+108
This would mean that the growth is in 1,1% higher than merely holding the asset (+0.3%) for the same time period.
There are some key questions that come off the back of this…
1.	In practice, would the value behave like this, would a candlestick chart be more appropriate to use?
2.	Is it possible to automate this? It appears that GDAX (linked to CoinBase) doesn’t currently support trailing stops and auto orders, but I’ve queried this.
3.	In a larger sample, are transactions akin to transaction 3 more commonplace? 
Thoughts please!

Value of fiat is built purely on the trust of that counties central bank, no trust, no value...
Bitcoin would need the whole peer to peer network to crumble. Unlikely as there is advantages in bitcoin to all users.
Bitcoin is fuelled by personal greed* and underpins it's adoption usage and value
