I don't know that Warren Buffett is smarter than us all. He might be more experienced (wiser) than *most* of us, and most of that experience might exist in the financial world, but he grew up seeing things like credit cards being invented. It's not like he has a lot of historical data to go by in the grand scheme of things. He's a billionaire, which means he got lucky several times in succession and also worked hard a lot. Even Mark Cuban, who I respect a lot as a smart guy and a hard worker, just got lucky at times. Everyone's still fallible. No one knows what's going to happen in ten seconds.
Also, Warren Buffett has said very clearly he can't even invest like we can anymore because he has so much money. He hasn't invested like "the little people" for quite a while. How long ago did he buy Geico? Longer than I've had my car insurance with them, that's for sure. :-D
Warren Buffett is also wholly motivated by money. Like, that's his life. And his hobby. He collects the stuff. I wouldn't put it past him to think of his life as an advertisement, constantly displaying whatever it is that will make you make him richer. If he said buy indices, it's benefiting him somehow.

First time reddit poster. 
I don't know the future. But I like the idea of bitcoin. I believe in it as much as I believe in the idea that I won't have cancer. It's an ideal future and it's probable, but God and I are on a need-to-know. 
So, I bought one bitcoin $20 and $30 at a time. It's like a few Starbucks or something and I don't care if I lose it. The exchange rate was always garbage, too. If bitcoin works out, I own (more than) 1/21,000,000th of the BTC supply, which is more than I can say for the USD supply. If it doesn't, I won't even miss the money.
Just thoughts.

Awesome. I'll stop working toward accepting bitcoin at my business because I can't code, so I get no say in whether it grows or not. Good attitude.

Thank you for your opinion. I'm now more able to process another viewpoint.

I disagree with your assessment of my motives. There is something to be said for balance. Without balance in one's thinking, one becomes an extremist. Both regulation and freedom have their merits, and one should define freedom before deciding too much of it is a good thing instead of a vice.
