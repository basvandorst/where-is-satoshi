Dude. Stocks are legit. It's just a way to spread capital to minimise risks. Crypto functions like that too. Is art a scam too? How about precious metals and gemstones? Consumer products? Everything has value and value is real. Bitcoin enables transfer of 'abstracted' value in a secure and instant manner. How is that a scam? It surely has some worth. And as adoption growths, so does value, since supply is fixed. Bitcoins price will keep rising in the future, unless you expect negative adoption.
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:19:27

That's what happends when supply is fixed and people hold, not only for gains, but moreso for store of value. For now, btc is an asset that has every characteristic that makes it suitable as a currency. However since it 'better' money , people are more likely to spend usd, and hold onto btc. Most btc owners don't care to much for short term price. They know the trends move towards less volatility and increased value over time.

Isnt the logical thing to do to make a smart contract with two keys: both keys are needed to unlock the funds. When you, the master key holder don’t show for x amount of time (presumed dead) it turns into a one-of-two unlockable adress. Doesnt the new adress format actually allow for this?

The thing is, there Will always be vulnerabilities. Better not make the underlying technology more complicated, as that inevitably lead to more attack vectors. The best way to protect against forced entry into your bitcoin wallet is to make Sure No-one knows how much you actually have

Na, you cannot directly compare bubbles. For instance the way the Dutch tulip mania has been portrayed in relation to bitcoin is VERY much off from the truth. You have to do independent research to find that 1) close to no-one was actually buying/selling tulip bulbs 2) the bulbs in question were those with a really specific pattern, caused by a fungus (so they were actually VERY scarce, like art). Do you think art is also in a bubble? 300 million for a painting ain't exactly cheap.

How can you honestly think bitcoin is not!!? ( I read your statement as follows: gold AS OPPOSED TO bitcoin is very usefull.) Bitcoin (as a payment system, not just the currency) is immutable, unseizable, permissionless, instant, low fee, energy efficent from a safety perspectif ( some will contend this fact, but remember that bitcoin is already able to withstand attacks by colluding nationstates)

Im on my phone, so not able to make lenghty comments on everything you say. But ill give it a go. Seizing is different from stealing. Ive had mutiple 100 dollars stolen, yet not a single crypto (thats MY experience). Ive not had money seized. But with crypto no- one CAN seize it.

Have you ever recieved bitcoin from a peer? As soon as they click send, and the transaction enters the mempool, you are 99,99% sure. Then, after the tx is included in a block you can be ~100% sure. For me this is as close to instant as it gets

Hi, as you have probably noticed, many people in this space are incredibly helpful and honest.
My 2 cents in this situation: don't rush anything. Try to educate yourself, take it step by step. Maybe watch a few hours or Andreas Antonopoulis to understand What bitcoin is. Because if you DON'T, you risk losing everything.
Some points: if the coins are currently stored safely, nothing changes that, unless you make a mistake
The blockchain is a public ledger. You can download a full copy (~200gb) and use for instance bitcoin core (a trusted, vetted program) to figure some stuff out. - why not purchase 50 bucks of bitcoin for yourself first just to figure things out!! Why not spend 100 bucks on a hardware wallet? You don't know what the difference is? Exactly, you need to catch up on that information 
Whenever you transfer anything, first send a small amount (10bucks), just to test if You didn't make any mistakes.
If anything seems out of the ordinary, unknown, weird or just doesn't feel right, don't do it: ask for help/advice. This space is still the wild west, so scammers roam free.

You are correct. Also selling 10k bitcoins on an exchange isn't simply worth price*amount. Your sell order will actually push the price down
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:01:01
True value? What is the true value of gold? Value is a concept of comparison. As long as bitcoin is used it will have value: remember bitcoin is more than a 'coin' , it's a piece of a decentralized trust system

@_date: 2019-02-10 18:25:32
For every bitcoin out there SOMEONE has to hold it. If its not me, its someone else. So long as you are buying btc (as oposed to mining), the oposite side of the trade 'loses' when you gain. This effects traders especially since traders are essentially betting agains each other.

from 1 to 2 mb not so much, but it sets a precedent for larger block sizes.. 2 to 4, 4 to 8 etc etc. 
Then, when you start calculating what you actual goal is (5 bilion people doing multiple transaction a day)
you end up with 5 bilion *150 bytes per day. so devide by 24h * 6 (=10 minute cylces) and calculate to mb, you get around 520 mb PER BLOCK
so now, when you are a node, you need to recieve 520 mb per 10 min. as you see.. this does not solve the problem.. it just creates a new one
And to answer your question: only big miners can facilitate this kind of size, and so centralisation will occur.

It offers many upsides (eg. speed, permissionlessness) and maybe even pushes legal frameworks to a next lvl since your regulair bank is cut out and technically your crypto had only been put into a contract and has not been exchanged to others fiat.

So first, thank you for taking the time to write this all up, and reading the article and stuff.. I dont think we are enemies. we just have different oppinions and that is ok! actually i am glad that we do, so that we can have a meaningfull discussion from which we can both learn. 
so yes, i was aware of the fork. And yes i do spend my time posting mainly on this sub, but i do read a lot outside this sub. I dont want to fall prey to any form of cencorship or propaganda, and i know there is some of that on both siders (BTC vs BCH).
I also knew about the original no-size limit and why the limit was imposed.
I was not aware of the fact that the article stated that BCH community has no interest in a L2 solution and i can imagine that those developing BCH also have intersted in a L2 solution. So im with you in that sence. And honestly, i do think that in essence it does not make that much of a difference ( 1mb blocks or 8mb blocks that is) as for cetralization. And in the short term, 8mb blocks would be great! 
However, as i previously mentioned. To me, it would put everyone on a tilting slope, where we will eventually end up with even larger and larger blocks (this might never happen, but it is my fear).
and purely for that reason i think we should not adopt only larger blocks. 
Also, although i must admit i am no expert in this, and it does sound a bit like a conspiracy, If antminers are able to covertly use ASIC boost to get an advantage and hold a patent, they would have a very unfair advantage, that could destroy the whole system. And in that way, i do think we should first adress that problem.

thank you for your enlightenment. Then what would you say is the source of this variance?
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:20:45
Ok lets base it on facts.
the fact is that hashpower decides which chain will be longest (and therefore most secure, most worth etc). Therefore i have only passive controll (i dont mine, but i can decide what to do with my money).
If, in the furute, i want to participate (as a miner, or just with my full node). i would have to verify and propagate blocks and add them to my chain . Now, when these blocks keep getting bigger and bigger, there is less possibility for me to do so. And that, i don't like. I joined bitcoin because it empowers me and taking that power away, even slowly, is agains my ideology.

Ok slow down. First lets figure out if bitcoin is realy realy failing to scale. The scale you (and me too) want is 5 billion people using this 20 times a day. In that respect, no bitcoin is not scaling: it is however holding on to its ideals (e.g. decentralization). I agree it has to find a solution, but it should not be rushed. block size increase is a short term solution that has profound long term negative effects (it significantly deminishes decentralisation) and therefore IMHO it is not the best solution. Im not saying that i have the solution though, im just saying that we should take this road slowly and coutiously.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:26:43
fees are so high because miners are acting maliciously. The system should be anti fragile, so eighter it survives and becomes stronger, or its not anti-fragile

Ok i get that. But then at the least it is an indicator. Time will tell, but i do think that current hash rate is substantially lower since there is a limited amount of hash rate, and much is being diverted into bcash.

@_date: 2017-11-14 07:25:39


i dont agree with this. Ether has low fees, and a turing complete machine, and therefore has a totaly different functionality. 
Even with bitcoins high fees i see high value in bitcoin, as is stores my value and as a unit of acount. As currently i transact maybe once every couple months. And i await the right moment (when transaction backlogs are cleared and i can pay &lt;1 dollar (20 sat/B)
I do agree with you that an increase from 1 to 2 mb does not exclude anything for the future however, it does set a precedent, and in doing so it is a tilting slope. 
The alternative is that miners would stop spamming (my honest believer is that the network is spammed by miners to make us pay higher fees, although there is no way to prove this). Mind you that these same miners are the ones switching between bcash and bitcoin chains, thereby increasing the problem. This shows to me exactly the problem.
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:17:14
ok this is my view: good that you started getting bitcoin!! Welcome to the community! First: educate yourself. Read, watch, use your head and know that YOU are now responsible for those btc. 
Some advice: treat bitcoin as it is meant, that is as a deflationary, p2p, CURRENCY. The Nice thing about this is the deflationary nature: no longer do you have to RISK your money in the market to NOT lose money due to inflation. 
Appart from this "deflationary store of value", Bitcoins only true usecase is as a transactional currency (and not so much as an "INVESTMENT"). Sure, you can beat the market, but for every dollar you gain, someone else has to lose. There is no free lunch. 
So my advice? Hold bitcoin (true bitcoin, as in, you physically hold the seed, or private keys), and hold it for the long run. But spend it! See what its usecasses are. Pay for online services, that you would otherwise pay with bank or creddit. See how it is near instant, near feeless, borderless, permissionless, immutable and mathmatically sound MONEY. And after you spend it, buy the same amount back with your inflationary fiat. Over time, with a high likelyhood, saving bitcoin will benefit you, like saving should. Goverments try to incentivice you to spend. Bitcoin incentivices you to save.

It is. Try sending 10 dollars to Ethiopia. It's everything BUT instant. With bitcoin there is no exception.
Read my earlyer reply. When the transaction shown in the mempool, it's done. And that's &lt;1 sec

Syncing problem? If the transactions shows in your wallet and on a block explorer it's not synced
@_date: 2019-04-01 08:59:54
Dude, when you send a transaction to the network and it shows up in the mempool of a random node, that means your transaction has been propagated throughout the network. This normally happends within a second. Now that the transaction is in the mempool, it is gonna get mined (with the exception of too little fee). You can be assured that the transaction is done. If the receiving end needs 1 or 2 or more confirmation that's up to their side and has very little to do with the protocol itself. Bitcoin IS instant, however it has to be included in a block to be 'irreversible'. The amount of work covering your transaction increases over time, increasing the security with each block added. After a blocks it takes an amount of energy larger or equall to the entire network to reverse.

If I farm apples and sell them, I add value to the economy which wasn't there before. if no money is added, each extra apple produced dilutes the fiat worth of all the other apples. However you can argue that the apple is still worth the same. In order to maintain the same price for that apple, fiat money is added into circulation as the amount of apples in the market increases.

@_date: 2019-01-04 13:49:50
Take into consideration that many goods were created since then. When value is added, fiat has to enter the system in order to not cause deflation. Immagine the following simplified example: there is only 100k of money in the world, and it buys you a house. Now when someone builds a comparable house, in order to maintain the same fiat buying power 100k must be printed. Otherwise the 100k must be deflated and the holder of that 100k can now buy two 50k houses.

Lets not forget that the bitcoin creates a direct incentive to make itself more energy efficient. Both by spearheading chip thermo efficiency ( which has been pushed greatly due to btc) and by rewarding renewable (cheap, local, abundant) energy use.

It all depends on which party you are paying the dept to. Fiat is dept, yes, and interest is payed on that debt. So if interest is paid on all debt, where does the interest come from? It is created in an endless cycle which will eventually crash trough hyperinflation like EVERY fiat currency in history. However, nothing stops those in power from just creating another form of fiat. The only way out is take the printing away from the goverment (like gold, silver, or other commodities; you can't inflate what isn't there)
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:41:54
When value is added, that value (measured in fiat) must come from somewhere (because someone needs to trade it) in order for one dollar to retain its value in a growing economy, that increased value needs to be added to the existing circulation.
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:15:13

Deflation or inflation is not bad or good in itself. Its just numbers, it is what it buys that ultimately matters. Gold is the best example: an ounce bought you a nice attire (toga, sandals) around 0BC, nowadays it still buys you a nice suit, shoes. Its exchange value has been fairly stable over time. 
Also I don't think money is given to the politicians (they get to decide what to do with it, and we hold them accountable trough election).

The best way to protect against this is imho is to chop it up into portions. Savings (90% of a persons capital) rarerely needs to be transacted and therefore the key could be managed by a 'bank' or third party. The other 10% could be ensured.

I disagree. In my experience the only time fees were high (like, 10 dollars) was at the 17-20k range, and that's in part because someone (jihan/Roger I presume) were constantly pushing volume on low fees to inflate the memory pool. And at those prices who cares about a couple dollars more.
Let's assume lots of people start using bitcoin for retail transactions. When you send out the transaction for a low fee, it may get included after a couple hours, but why care? When you order clothes online, or pay bills or whatever, it just doesn't matter, and if it does, spend some money on fees. Let's assume you pay for coffee, who cares if it's zero confirmations! You think someone is gona do all that work,and remove that transaction from the cach of 1000s nodes? No, so they will get it eventually, even if it's a day later. Same way checks work, and they take those all the time.
Now let's say there are niche cases. Well just change 100$ (once, when blocks are almost empty, for a low fee) for dogecoins or litecoin or whatever you please, and use those.

No, not at all, it was just in relation to a post I saw yesterday, about a guy buying 10 pounds worth and spending 2,50 on each TX. Just trying to warn people

Like everything in life it won't last forever. Just untill something better comes around. But then again, bitcoin is software, so if it is in the best interest of the majority of the network, it can adapt.

Lost how? There are miners in every country

I guess you are not using the bitcoin.Com scam wallet. Good for u

Check johoes mempool for exact numbers, but lately 1-10 says is just fine
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:54:29
It's far more economically viable to buy coins with the money you save when you don't have the miners plugged in.
So, ask your parent if they can just hand you the money. Also saves a lot of work.
If you just want to do it for the experience, just start, plug it in, run software, join a pool, earn. That is always a good investment.

So you wrote down your seed words: download a wallet and import that seed. Now check johoes mempool (Google), see what the lowest fee was that got cleared the previous blocks. This does however not guarantee it gets included since blocktimes can vary, and so space in blocks are bidded up by higher fee transactions. If you want to be included in the next block, just overpay by 10sats/byte.
Welcome to the club man. It can be a rough ride learning how to bitcoin, but you are still early to the game, so expect a bumpy road.

Time in te market beats timing the market. Remember that and make a decent buck. 
But be realistic.. I know a couple people that own some bitcoin. In reality, I see no way they will be millionaires in 2-5 years. Maybe because they will inevitably sell at some point, or maybe because the price just won't go that high. Eighther way, just try to be realistic. 
When something sounds to good to be true ( like a 1000%+ return the comming years) it's probably not gona happend. However a 50% increase (or decrease for that matter) isn't that unlikely given bitcoins volatile nature. 
When you get into bitcoin for investment purposes instead of its ideology, then you better think like an investor. Investors know upfront when they will exit so when the price hits that target they sell and move on. Retail investors often don't really have an exit strategy and instead make decisions based on their feelings causing them to lose money (sometimes they gain some, too but thats because they are basically gambling). For normal people, hodling gives the best risk/return. Read the post from the dude/chick (?) that invented the term HODL. He experienced it too

If you say why bitcoin, then the answer is safety. (immutable and backed by huge amounts of hashpower) With the bitcoin protocol your coins are provably safe. So any amount high enough to to warrant a big amount of safety should logically be placed into bitcoin instead of other coins. As to being a everyday currency, you could exchance 1000 dollars of bitcoin each month to lightcoin (think about an analogy of selling your gold for dollars, both are money, but one is easyer) because it warrants less security. Or just use lightning with the same safety of bitcoin.

I don't think you have studied the protocol very thoroughly. Let me explain: first, bitcoin is not a currency, but a currency SYSTEM. No coin/key- pairs exist outside this system. The system is autonomous (due to its decental nature). One of its autonomous features is a feedback loop that makes sure mining is ALLWAYS profitable for some (the only exceptions being malicious actors, but by design bitcoin is very well protected against those). There will not be 'a moment when mining stops'. At most there will be a period where transactions become backloged for a couple days. Above all remember that bitcoin is software, and that software is programmable. When the majority sees benefits is changing the protocol it'll be changed.

'If you don't get it by now, I'm not going to be the one to explain it to you' 
Just ignore this guy. There are always people that want to say stuff and act like they know what they are talking about when actually they haven't heard a single word of God emperor Andreas's gospel.

Shorting creates selling pressure now pushing prices lower and making less profitable miners shut down. Then adjustment will kick in, making it more profitable for any miners that continue to mine. They will however have to buy back at some point, and when no-one wants to sell them any of those juicy coins I'll bite them in the ass unless they can mine them.
You can say what you want about the spot price, but if I'm not selling at that price it doesn't hurt me one bit. Let them play their games. There are only so many bitcoins and the halvening is comming no matter what.
