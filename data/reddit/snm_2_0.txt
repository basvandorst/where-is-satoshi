Mania is reaching a fever pitch, but I kind of feel bad for you , OP. Watch Big Short tonight and sell your bitcoin tomorrow morning, it is not too late. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:34:24
Totally legit electrum.exe dowloaded from electrum website has been infected with trojans before, exactly like in OP's story, somehow they fugured how to infect electrum.exe at the source.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:09:04
Right. Are we gong to pretend that previousy solid electrum now has vulnerabilities? Are we going to pretend that as bitcoin grows in value, the attacks will get more brazen abd sophisticated? You are essentially advising OP to continue to be a sucker so someone else will come in and steal it yet again.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:21:00
Lol, 40 h/week at minimum wage and not feeling like a rat? What a good rat you are, carry on! Besides, OP sounds like they are from the US, but I can be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:03:07
oh, please.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:53:46
This should be your cue to exist and sell. Bitcoin has very limited practical value and its practical value is getting more limited with every passing day. As of now it is sustained by FOMO and insane mania but it cannot go on like that forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:29:51
I've read about similar cases before , somehow electrum.exe got trojan in it and the rest is just like OP's story. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:02:41

Same here, learned about bitcoin in 2013, was very interested, but my broke ass could not afford any risky moves, so, I have been following it ever since, still cannot afford it, lol. But when I ask myself, would I hold through all those crashes bitcoin went through? I think bitcoin really messes with a head of those poor and desperate, rich can afford risk of investing, risk of holding, risk of loosing, always emerge as winners in the end, the poor ones kill themselves or live and struggle. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:33:44
What you meant to say, investing is not for the poor, right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:33:18
Are miners the financial institution then?
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:13:01
This is a sweet soapy sentiment, but let's be real and honest. In today's world people get squeezed from all sides, when you are a wage slave you feel like a rat in a wheel, heck, you do not have time to enjoy shit or "explore" when you work 3 jobs, while you rent goes up every year (but your salary/wage is not, your hours being cut, job outsourced or will be given to robots). It is not about yacht or toys, it is about basic security, you know, Maslow's basic level, secure place to live, healthy food to eat, free time to play. 
In situations like that Bitcoin really fucks with your mind with either regrets or FOMO. Just like a beautuful cake fucks up with a mind of someone who is starving, or fresh water stream with someone dying of thirst.
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:15:43
I started with bitcoin, only to quickly realize I can do jackshit with it as I am a poor shibe and my faucet dust costs more to move around than to let it sit in my wallet. I appreciate bitcoin though because it taught me a lot and I am still learning. I like that even poor shibe like me can mine dogecoin, can buy dogecoin and can tip dogecoin. I also like the community spirit, niceness of shibes and their love for underdoges. 
here is for you, grumpy :)

@_date: 2017-11-26 03:51:21
yay, good for you, I guess. It was and still is pretty much Las Vegas tier gamble. If you can afford to lose your savings, you are in the same boat with the crowd who does not know the true cost of money since they swim in it. But there will be poor suckers/bag holders who will be absolutely crushed and devastated when it all blows. 
There is so much shit going on in this world that could have been alleviated by all this dough flowing into bitcoin. You are ready to see your saving burn just for the sake of being a "part of something amazing", this is just fucked up, given the state of all world now. It is because of you and other fuckers literally burning money our world is so fucked up. 
For example, for a fraction of what was burned on bitcoin several species that are currently going extinct could have been saved. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:12:22

OP is a poster child for unlimited human greed. Net worth over 1M and he is depressed. Just unbelievable, bitcoin has a way of exposing it all. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:00:57
these are 167 BTC buy and 128 BTC buy, you can figure how much it is in fiat, right?
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:56:06
no it is not, Bitcoin is the exercise in human greed, nothing else.  I bet when you are counting your thousands, you do not lose sleep over how much energy Bitcoin burns and pollution that is being created, just to name one issue.

[bitcoinmarkets beg to differ](
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:00:59
yeah, you tell yourself that. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:36:52
nothing fucking grows forever, it will blow up and burn many so bad that it could effectively kill crypto. But what amazes me even more is how much money people have to just casually drop for bitcoin, buying today at ATH 25 BTC, 29 BTC. They sure do deserve a harsh lesson, but then again, these are probably folks who can blow 100K a day on coke and hookers and do not blink an eye.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:39:01
So, you are basically saying that there will be no dramatic shorts driving bitcoin below 1000 usd? [What do you think about this guy analysis?](
And what about quantum computers that will supposedly crack all private keys making crypto essentially worthless? These are coming in few years more likely....
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:25:09
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:34:24
No, it will not be just "a dip", it will be one massive crash, because this is really just one in a lifetime opportunity for these bloodsuckers  to short it. It will go to below 1000 USD, it will crush people and it will take years, if ever, to recover. I am amazed people do not see it coming. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:36:31
just give it to me, since you can afford to lose it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:07:45
CME can move no more than 20% a day. but they can still trigger massive sell out inn addition to whales selling.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:14:21
What do you think will happen around December 11 when futures are expected to go live? Will it be a fast crash or a steady decline, if any? What do you think about futures making bitcoin less volatile and hence less attractive to speculators? 
Finally, would you invest in some mixed crypto portfolio with bitcoin, eth, waves, wings and other altcoins/tokens? Some argued that altcoins brought them 13000% growth in 2017, but then again, these were early adopters who always do good, because they buy stuff for peanuts.  And these alts nearly always go down if bitcoin plunges (with some exceptions)
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:28:35
These are nasty whales scooping up all btc they can get just to short it and kill it on December 11. These are not btc enthusiasts and grandmas buying on hype. This is very bad, 2013 level bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:41:32
bitcoin is all about the sentiment. When it crashes massively it will definitely pour some cold water on the hot love we have now. Do you remember 2013 with its initial wave of suicides, and then absolute lull and lack of interest with btc price sitting in hundreds and no one is being interested in bitcoin anymore? This is what big short will do. Futures after big short will also kill all volatility btc is so famous for and attractive to traders. It is just bad all around. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:59:53
yes, this is what I am afraid will happen too, big drop, maybe not drastic in terms of time, like not over a day or an hour, but a drastic, large drop and then stagnation like it was in 2013 when everyone has left except for most dedicated HODLers and those who forgot they had bitcoin on some old hard drives. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:58:58
stop calling it a dip, it will be crush. And of course there will be no buyers when btc price will go from 10 k to under 1 k. Some enthusiasts will definitely rush to buy, but it will be just hardcore minority. Just wait and see how it plays out, also read [this](
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:30:50
Tell them to kick you out to live on the streets like a bum, so all money saved from raising you could be invested in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:36:57
You are looking at the evidence of big boys (aka traders who move millions daily) buying shitload of bitcoin, so they can short it on December 11 and drive the price below 1000 USD. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:31:18
Exciting time? I remember years ago forks were dreaded as basically the value killers, because splitting bitcoin makes it less valuable as a value storage. Just look at ether classic, still there, still being traded, if anything, the fork will halve the value at least. Better get out if bitcoin completely before August 1.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:30:05
Just going to quote someone who said it the best:


@_date: 2017-05-28 12:04:03
Bitcoin's only value is the ability to store value, you have to be delusional to not see it. I have been following bitcoin since 2011, in 6 years no mass adoption happened, and bitcoin became a value storage, nothing else. Any forks, soft or hard, will kill this purpose, because if it will be done once, why will it not happen again in 10 years? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:44:25
Oh, god, you are insane, eustan.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:49:47
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:50:12
Well, meet Tezos my friend....
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:56:49


Why are you lying like that? Forking will halve bitcoin value at least, in the most rosy scenario. Two chains will mean more bitcoins, twice as many, look at ether classics, still alive and kicking. If bitcoin forks once, it will do it again. If you want to protect your money, sell it all before August 1.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:35:38
Get 10
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:23:17
No, not really, does it matter? I was under the impression that when you try to combine these tiny bits of bitcoin and send one big chunk, the fee will be based on how many tiny bits are in there. That is why I think buying bitcoin in 5 buck chunks is too expensive.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:47:58
Yes, only 1 btc=1btc means shit, people are ONLY interested in bitcoin because it will be 10,000 usd a piece in 10 years. Forks essentially mean it will never ever happen.
@_date: 2017-05-10 11:49:26
Long time ago I used faucets to collect some dust. When I finally consolidated it all in one chunk I paid a hefty fee. These small bitcoin fragments will cost more if you will want to move, or sell them.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:41:58
If you really want to alert users, tell the truth, August 1 is the end of bitcoin, sell it all and move to another crypto.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:32:44
Fucking delusional.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:39:34
Not a shill, been following bitcoin since 2011. It is lazy to simply call everyone who disagrees with you a shill, instead if trying to refute the concern.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:49:44
So, you insist on your delusions?
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:22:28
Hard fork will follow, no doubt about that. The damage is not just in technicalities, but in basic psychology. What the situation shows is: a) people will alwats be bickering about something in relation to bitcoin; b) it will be resolved by forking, ad infinitum. 
Maybe it is time to admit that bitcoin is faulty, does not scale well, and move on to 3.0 version like Tezos or something like that. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:35:52
Or you will get 2 versions like with ether classic, with people trading both. Few years later there will be another fork, because why not? This fork will kill bitcoin, it kills the whole idea of it being unique, limited, etc. Dogecoin costs next to nothing because it is being constantly created, by forking bitcoin you get in the same territory. Because if bitcoin can be forked once, it will be forked again.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:21:09
Sell everything asap.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:58:19


solid plan, lol, like anyone will be buying failed coin at that point.
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:27:05
so this basically means at this point nothing like this exist, right?

the problem is the majority of donors are computer illiterate and do not want to register wth any companies. It should be something like paypal donate button, they donate in $$ and we receive in btc
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:37:20
yes it has. You have no idea what you're talking about. Even though the amount earned from each faucet is small it cannot  be sent without transaction fee because it is considered "dust" and is also too small to include the fee. So it is sitting here in limbo in my wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:57:49
Bitcoin QT client does not let me to send dust without a fee, period. There is no way around it. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:53:50
but didn't just some guy have 70,000 USD in BTC stolen from his blockchain wallet few days ago?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:46:47
not true. It depends on amount you want to transfer. In early days I did earn some small amounts from faucets and cannot do anything with them, cannot spend them or combine and send them as one transaction. The client does not allow me to send them without the fee and the fee is larger than the amount of tiny BTC I earned via faucet. So I have like dozens of payments that are nearly 0.5 BTC combined, yet can do shit with them. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:59:21
I personally think it is manually and artificially driven up as we see all these hacks and heists going on. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:20:50
As a small bitcoin user with no extensive technical knowledge these things scare the shit out of me. Could someone please explain in simple terms how did this happen? I understand he kept bitcoins not in the client like Bitcoin-QT, but on one of the exchanges? Could something like this happen when BTC are stored in Bitcoin-QT?
