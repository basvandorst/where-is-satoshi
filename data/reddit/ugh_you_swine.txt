Other currencies have policies and regulations to ensure that a single bank (exchange) can't bring down an entire currency.
Really unfortunate that MtGox is synonymous with Bitcoin to most of the general public.

None of this can work for bitcoin until the markets stabilize and reduce volatility. The ECB can publish there rates because they know nothing can tank the EUR/USD rate in a single day. Other, lesser used currencies, also can't publish this rate on a daily basis due to inflation/deflation and are relegated to using the current market exchange as their metric for conversion.

Supply and Demand. Same way the Dow and NYSE gain/lose pretty much the same percentage on a daily basis. If you can sell for a better price on a different exchange, you will sell there. Eventually this evens out and prices settle across all exchanges.

No, chargebacks would allow you to get the bitcoins and your money back.

Your landlord is going to notice an increase in electricity usage, be sure your lease doesn't have a clause for acceptable usage or you could end up footing that bill very quickly.

If you send bitcoins to this address, don't expect to get anything back.

What noise are you referring to? MtGox reports a weighted average and all the financial charts I've seen show historical date with high/low/average being reported as well.
If you are asking for a simple way to judge bitcoin value, compare it to other currencies. This is how we judge the buying power of a dollar with a euro.
I don't understand what you are actually looking for, mind trying to explain it a bit better?

You should have them in a wallet somewhere in an exchange or on your computer.

The point you are missing is that nothing backs bitcoins like governments back their currencies(EU, US, Japan). The governments that can't back their currencies act just like bitcoin does. Without some sort of backing, nothing can guarantee an exchange rate except the market.
Look at what the EU just did in their deal with Cyprus and then look at the affect it had on the overall value of the Euro. If it were bitcoins, the market would've responded much more violently, but because there were governments able to retain trust in the system and back the currency - the effects were much smaller.
Bitcoin won't be able to set an exchange rate, like what you are wanting, as it is illiquid and de-centralized.

At least the loss in value has been over months, not minutes.

Stop thinking of bitcoin as a way to make money and start looking at it as currency used to exchange goods and services. If people keep looking at bitcoin as a way to make money the speculation will kill it.

You lost purchasing power as the value of your bitcoin, in relation to tangible goods, decreased in value.

The buying power of your bitcoins is greatly reduced compared to a couple day ago.

No, bitcoin value isn't backed by anything. The exchanges report the buy/sell prices which give an indication of the value of a bitcoin. If you want a currency that is backed by something, there are numerous centralized fiat currencies at your disposal.

MtGox doesn't need to 'elude the powers that be', they need a technology to power their exchange that scales well as they continue to grow.
I guess I don't understand why you are talking about TPB when it has nothing to do with the current controversy regarding MtGox.
