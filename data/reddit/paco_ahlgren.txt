You just strengthened my argument.

Everything is moving to p2p, and total encryption as a response to exactly the type of activity you are describing. The Internet as we know it is going to change dramatically as open-source technologies allow us to move easily around with total anonymity.
Your point about ease-of-use is certainly valid, but again, once the infrastructure is in place, it won't be a matter of proactive implementation; people will simply use private services as the default. For instance, Facebook (or its successors) won't *offer* privacy, per se -- it will be built into the sites' security protocol. In other words, if you use the site, your traffic will be tunneled automatically -- whether you need it or not.
Because anonymizing Internet traffic is getting so inexpensive, I don't see how anyone can impede its private implementation. Intelligence agencies can bitch, but they don't have the resources to stop encrypted p2p traffic.
See Wuala, vs. DropBox. I believe DropBox will either have to implement zero-knowledge, or face some unpleasant desertions. All it takes is one well-publicized breach, and customers will bolt to more private alternatives (like Wuala).

You're missing the point. As Bitcoin gets adopted, the demand will be there, because transactions will be cheap and easy. That has never been possible until now.

I agree... But what makes them really cool is that they can teleport gold! :-)

It's faster and cheaper. So it does things a lot better.
I feel a silly argument coming on. I'm going to let you hash it out with someone else. Adoption is a foregone conclusion.

As a published author, I can tell you that sentence makes absolutely no sense.

You just strengthened my argument.

Oh. Well in that case, I withdraw my article.
Reddit is so cool.

You should send it to him over the Internet.

I'm trying to imagine the resources required to trace every "questionable" transaction in the blockchain. I will grant that an intelligence agency could track some of them -- if the users are not careful. But to follow up on all of them? And if a user mixes his bitcoins and takes simple precautions, there's no amount of computing power in the universe that can track an address.
All this debate about the lack of anonymity in the blockchain is moot. Even if it were a practically applicable phenomenon (which it's not), technological innovation is about one nano-second away from solving the problem inexorably.
Talk to me in a year and tell me how "un-anonymous" the bitcoin protocol is.
The real threat is going to come from spending patterns. No amount of anonymity is going to save you from tax authorities if you're buying Ferraris with no demonstrable source of taxable income on the source of those funds. But this too is going to be an ephemeral problem, as governments lose more and more resources for investigating these activities.

Google, Facebook, and Twitter are all products of the Internet, which did NOT take less than a year to adopt.
You just strengthened my argument.

I think Bitcoin, Snowden, and the NSA are going to make that happen sooner, rather than later. :-)

Boner humor. How positively profound.
