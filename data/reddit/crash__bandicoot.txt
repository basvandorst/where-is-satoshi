Well in Japan some people can pay up to 30,000 yen for a dinner at Jiro's Sushi shop. A startling number to some, but to the Japanese it's a relatively easy amount to calculate.

This case doesn't work as "guilty until proven innocent." It should always be the other way around to uphold journalistic ethics.
Also, the article uses language that it was "uncovered" that Green is the scammer throughout.
I'm not saying it's bad writing, because its good. Research was well done. I'm just not impressed by all of these sources posing the story as definite rather than plausible.
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:24:03
I've been looking at reviews. It seems pretty solid. FDIC insured and everything. 
The only issues are that you **have** to be friends with your smartphone, as it is built for it, depositing cash isn't easy nor is checks unless you have a good camera.
I have an HTC One, which turns the front facing camera purple, so I'm skeptical if this would work for me or not. However, I could just use Simple for Bitcoin-only transactions and keep my pre-existing bank account.

Let's be honest, the only way I can earn your trust is to write credible and unbiased news articles. That's what I believe do, and that's what I'll continue to do. Even if I write an article about an altcoin that I hold, it's disclosed every time. I'm held accountable at every angle not only by CCN, but by readers.
If I do write an advertorial, it is clearly marked with full disclosure each and every time. It is also kept away from the news headlines. The "no-follow" concern has been sent well above my head by our editor as per this thread.

* No negative consequences *so far* that PayPal having your information is bad.
* Being your own bank is a horrible undertaking that I do not personally enjoy.

While Dogecoin was/is a joke design, it has done some great things for some great charities. So yes, while it's a joke that has been beaten to death, it does have some degree of weight to it.
I don't hate the guy for mining the piss out of the coin, that's what he wants to do. But media are starting to refer to crypto as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin together. Way I see it, we need to have each other's backs to some degree.
I know a lot of people won't agree with me. But we're the little guys on the block that has received the most media success of any of the other small coins. And we need advice from the big coins.
Edit: either you ninja'd yours or I didn't catch most of this comment. I agree, we should have taken Litecoin. I backed it. 
Maybe it's time I moved my coins too.

Listen...I know you think you're doing good work in this sub. Sure, spreading dogecoin is great. I come from the too.
But what you're really doing is annoying these people. This mass tipping is causing a negative impact. 
Please, next time, consider not doing this. It would mean a lot not only to the community, but to the our little shibe community as well. 
**Edit: To draw a comparison: If Reddcoin came into our sub and tipped everyone there, that would leave a negative impression.**
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:13:11
Well I do. That's why I'm in on Bitcoin. But that divesting post was pretty persuasive. I don't know anyone on the face of the earth is immune to the swaying of opinion.

@_date: 2014-04-27 21:38:22
I mean, I'm not coming at you as a bitcoiner. I'm coming at you as a dogecoiner. What you're doing is negatively reflecting our community. 
To draw a comparison: If Reddcoin came into our sub and tipped everyone there, that would leave a negative impression. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 05:37:51
That would be ideal. I emailed them an hour ago and am awaiting a response.
@_date: 2014-06-25 16:47:46
You don't call 57 pennies 57 mDollars, do you?
Here's the issue on that. As mass adoption occurs, people from the outside will be discouraged to switch currencies if they can't have "one" of something.
I can have one whole dollar. I've been able to have that my whole life. I'm used to that line of thinking. What I'm not used to, is drastic change in my financial life. Hell, international currency exchanges confuse people.
So while the people who own multiple Bitcoin feel rich, people without one Bitcoin feel a bit insignificant. There's a psychological gap. To bridge that gap, "bits" would work.
I don't understand why there is resistance. Bits is a concept that literally has no downside. The people that have full Bitcoins can refer to them as such, and the people that don't can have Bits. 
If someone can show me some clear downsides, I'd appreciate it and keep an open mind.
@_date: 2014-08-20 22:11:51
What? Can you explain in more detail?
@_date: 2014-08-31 19:08:48
Is this not a red flag to anyone else? If a group of wealthy people wanted to crash Bitcoin value exchange, they'd only need about 10 bots doing this exact same thing. 
With the two (supposedly) that are doing it now, the price has fallen ~$30. Think if you made a mass amount of bots do it.
If someone like Bank of America, who has a huge amount of funds, wanted to take Bitcoin to sub-$100 and hurt BoA competition, they totally could by following this example, no?
@_date: 2014-04-11 23:05:36
That's a very bold and biased bunch of statements.
And I hold a shit load of Doge.

I'm a reporter following this same story to a tee. While the amount of possible evidence is overwhelming that Alex Green = Ryan Kennedy/Gentle, including witness testaments, pictures and leaked documents, there is **no link** that says it's undeniably true. That's the missing link everyone is looking for.
One side has a shitload more accusations than Green has a defense, but that doesn't make it true. Be careful when assuming possible evidence = fact. A link is still needed.
**Reading material that presents evidence as evidence, not as fact.**
[Second Name Change Document Emerges in Bitcoin Exchange CEO Alex Green Scandal](
[Leaked Document Supports Theory The Moolah CEO Alex Green Changed Name](
[New Sources Verify Bitcoin Exchange Moolah CEO Alex Green's Former Scammer Identity](

Unfortunately, I don't have access to the article. That's all CCN. If I had my laptop in front of me I'd be able to go into the back end and see whatever change was made.
My guess though? My editor saw a grammar error in my writing and corrected it. I highly doubt they'd change anything besides that or a spelling error.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:48:49
If that's what you're into, check out Dogecoin. They have a different model than Bitcoin that's operating on what you're suggesting. 
That much payout per block on Bitcoin would destroy its value. Bitcoin just isn't built that way.

Because he's a vendor.

I would completely agree with this statement. I've explained Bitcoin over and over, and I've learned people who ask me "So, what's Bitcoin?" don't want to hear the decentralized Blockchain PoW technicalities. 
They want to here that it's money, sent instantly, that's only controlled by you. "But can't I do that with PayPal?" Yes! But you have to trust PayPal with your information. With Bitcoin, you're literally your own bank.  
Then roll into technicalities when they ask they inevitable question "How does it work?" or "What backs it?"
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:10:19
So wait a second. Newbies shouldn't mine. Instead, we should let the current mining farms secure the network for us, mining all the new bitcoins on their behalf.
Won't that lead to "too big to fail" mining farms? Won't that also lead to these mining farms holding a majority of the bitcoins in the long run, leading to whales and more volatile price fluctuations? Not to mention an enormous wealth gap within the bitcoin community.
I think this is truly a notion that holds fear, uncertainty and doubt. Not just random spewing of FUD, but substantiated concerns for the future. I'd like to have a serious discussion about this.
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:19:06
I will say this: You're contributing. A lot of people aren't doing that. They log onto reddit and simply scour the comments section, pouring negativity wherever they go. is a victim of this from time to time. 
If you take some time to hone your skills and improve, you could do some funny videos about Bitcoin. But it will take time. 
I may not be enthralled with the content, but you're contributing. That's a good thing in my book. No matter what anyone may tell you, good or bad, tuck it away, keep practicing and work toward improving over time.

The business is not required by the Australian Taxation Office to charge the consumer 10%, or even 20%, extra at all. They are required to pay the ATO that GST. 
What you're doing is making an assumption that, in response to the tax guidelines, the business will then tax the consumer. But that's not how the tax guidelines lay this out. So yes, the ATO's Bitcoin Tax is far better for the consumer than most all other government's tax codes on Bitcoin (see the US and the UK).
However, I will absolutely agree with you that businesses could, in response, tax their consumers. They aren't required to, by law, but they could. To quote It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, "It's the *implication*."

Wow. Everybody in this thread is telling you to just not report it. No, **fuck that.** Legal penalty is real and I can imagine tax evasion is not a great spot on your record. 
Besides, why shouldn't you pay taxes? You're a citizen. Your community needs an education system, your roads need fixed and your social infrastructure needs funding. 
**It's not easy, but this is the process right now:**
Take how much the gift card cost and how much BTC you bought it for. Then find out how much you bought the Bitcoin for. Find the difference and you have your gains. 
For an even simpler way, use [LibraTax]( I'll personally vouch for it, because I love it. It automates the entire capital gains process by looking at your public key along with the Blockchain transactions that occur. It just went public a few days ago.
Go there, do your taxes, fund your community and stay the fuck out of prison.

Hey I feel the same way. I'm a late adopter of BTC, early adopter of DOGE. 
But I think it's because Dogecoin isn't serious. There are a lot of inexperienced investors there, and they aren't as advanced as Bitcoin. But even if Doge only hits $.01, it was a bit fun to experience what happened. Plus it got a shit ton more people into crypto.

I haven't received an email back for about 6 hours now, but that may be due to a time zone difference. I just wanted to send you a message to see if you had any information on your end. ANXPRO has been phenomenal in helping me through this, and I hope my dumb mistakes are resolved.

Hey Ryan, this is the author of the article. Thank you for posting this response. Seeing this thread is eye opening to how I let my opinion of Yishan bleed into this article; an opinion that I now feel is wrong.
Based on Yishan's comments, I let my opinion brood on him. That's something I shouldn't have done. I shouldn't have even allowed myself to write a biased article and headline, but I did. I'm sorry.
I'd also like to point you to a long apology I wrote to someone else in this thread. I hope you give it a look. 
And sincerely, I'm sorry for the way I portrayed Yishan in this article. Thank you for correcting me in a way that wasn't mean-spirited. I honestly appreciate it.

I emailed ANXPRO, but obviously that won't help me sleep tonight. ANXPRO said the withdrawl was processed on the website, but I can't find the incorrect address in the blockchain to see.

It is made **very clear** that sponsored stories are in their own separate category. When we do sponsored stories, they are advertorials and are kept in a clearly defined section away from the headline news.

@_date: 2014-07-14 04:11:34
I'm sorry, but this is a bit ridiculous. Let me try to sway you from your grudge against CCN.
I write for CCN. I find my articles to be very credible and unbiased. My thoughts are also separate from the other CCN writers entirely. 
There is no "consuming ideology" surrounding us CCN writers. We do not sit down and discuss how we are going to spin our articles each day. We have a decentralized system; every article published is directly from the mind of the author. If there are downward trends being predicted then that is because of the author, not CCN as a whole. Other news sources may do that, but not us. As a writer, I have freedom from a "hivemind news source" through CCN and I'm very grateful for that.
As many of us have already said in the comments here, we give full disclosure if we write advertorials (aka sponsored stories) and separate that content clearly and definitively **away from the news headlines.** They couldn't even possibly be mixed together by any stretch. As for no-follow concerns, our Editor has already forwarded the "no-follow" strategy to our Director in light of the feedback in this thread.
So please, I urge you not to hold a grudge against CCN if these were the root of your anger. I do not look to bend the news. I don't write articles based on a collective message or agenda. I am a separate writer in a decentralized news source. 
If you still have a grudge, so be it. I won't push it any further.

If the U.S. was actively locking people up for that, then I would. But they aren't.

I'm Clay Gillespie, author of the article and the person you're talking about. Downvotes or not, everyone here deserves to see an explanation.
**I'll be the first to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry.**
I sincerely don't try to let opinion guide my articles. That's why if you look at my published writings, most all of them stay far away from opinion. I barely ever even write any Op-eds.
I allowed my opinion of Yishan based on my research to dictate my writing and headline, and I'm sorry. 
As a writer and reporter I have a serious responsibility to the Bitcoin community to do better than this. I'm held to a higher standard, and should be, and I should work to keep my opinion out of articles and keep the facts straight.
There's a lot of hate in this thread against me, and I only ask that people still consider me a human being with thoughts and feelings. It hurts seeing people telling me to fuck off. I have thick skin, but it still hurts on an emotional level.
Looking through the feedback and the response from Ryan, I think its pretty clear that the "Anti-Bitcoin" remark I had about Yishan was **wrong** when writing this article. It was an opinion I held that I let bleed into my article, something that I often try to avoid. Again, I'm sorry. I really hope you believe me.

You can tell by how many bitcoins are shown in your electrum wallet. If your coin.mx wallet says 0, and your electrum wallet has bitcoins, then the transaction was completed. If your electrum balance says 0 and your coin.mx balance has coin it it, then the transaction wasn't completed. :)
Confirmations only mean that it was checked as valid by a miner. The more miners check it as valid, the more confirmations. Like I said, transactions are made on 0 confirmations from person to person. Companies just use them as checks and balances.

A trust factor. Bitcoin is meant to be trustless, but we haven't perfected the decentralized exchange. So why do I trust Coinbase? Well, they're partnered with PayPal along with some major companies accepting bitcoin. Industry leaders put their faith in Coinbase, so I think its a better alternative than the rest.
On top of that, Coinbase is insured. If something happens on their end that results in me missing bitcoins, they'll refund me.
Now **I'm not saying they're a perfect platform.** You just wondered why I use them over the alternative, and that's my answer.
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:52:36

Nope! A wallet that you've downloaded onto your computer is not an intermediary. A company that allows to purchase/storage of bitcoin on their site is.
The only risk in using a desktop-based wallet is the risk of malware. There have been some findings that show some malware target bitcoin wallets. Whether or not your computer is infected is unknown to me. 
That being said, there's always problems all around. If you keep you bitcoins on your phone, there's a possiblity someone could steal it thorugh the WiFi connection. If you keep it with a company, they could get hacked. If you keep it on your PC, a virus could steal it. 
The only absolute secure way to hold your funds is through something called cold-storage; whether that be printing off paper wallets or putting them onto a wallet on a computer that never touches the internet. 
With the new technology, you have to be willing to take a few risks. Until it matures and evolves there will be vulnerabilities. It's one of the perks of getting in early; it's the wild west out here.
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:33:29
Well the investment money would be going to the creators to pay for their development, so they'd still be implicit. 
In fact, if Lighthouse is enabling people to partake in an illegal activity, it will be **very** interesting how the Ross Ulbricht case plays out. That case sets some pretty serious precedent for web developers, if I'm not mistaken.

If Coin.mx doesn't release the fund to your wallet soon by 10 confirmations, contact them. 10 confirmations is wayyyyyy high, so I don't think you'll have a problem.

You raise an incredibly good point. 
~~This weekend they have an online meetup scheduled to test out the software (they normally host these type of "parties" for more volunteers to take part in the testing process) and I plan on attending to find that out specifically.~~
~~I'm currently fresh out of bits, and am making my first February purchase on BitSquare to see how this contraption functions. I'll be able to experience the process first-hand and see what I can deduce from it.~~
I misunderstood. Testing happens on the testnet. [Information here.](
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:01:29
Hmm. I'm not entirely sure of the question, but I think I can answer the question by explaining the confirmation process.
To send bitcoins, you need zero confirmations. If I were to send bitcoins to your electrum wallet, it would be there in an instant with zero confirmations.
But to create a system of checks and balances, some companies won't release funds until they receive a certain amount of confirmations. So coin.mx may not send the coins until three confirmations exist, meaning they won't end up in your wallet until that third confirmation. If I'm following correctly, it sounds like you're talking about going through the process like this:
Coin.mx -&gt; Personal Wallet -&gt; Other Wallet
You can't send from Person Wallet -&gt; Other Wallet until the transaction is confirmed and the funds are released by Coin.mx. Once they're released, they'll show in your wallet and you'll see your balance change, meaning you can send them wherever instantly.
Does that make sense? Or am I off base? Feel free to elaborate so I can try to hit on the right chord.
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:02:35
Right, but Ross Ulbrict wasn't selling weed on Silk Road. Other people were. He just created the website.
In your example, **eBay** would be prosecuted for creating a platform that allowed for the sale of weed. That is - if Ulbricht is prosecuted and sets precedent.
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:58:41
Hmm, I've never used FDroid or paper wallets so I can't say I know the answer to that. I guess one way to check it out would be to disconnect your device from all internet connections and try to generate a private key. If it can't, then it's there's a vulnerability. I could be way off base on that assumption though, as I've never used the program.
Talking with so many different companies and devs of multi-sig wallets, it's hard to pick just one. Coinkite simplifies the process and offers free multisig wallets, using a special process to generate the keys. Rodolfo, the CEO, seems to be quite critical of how other companies attempt to offer wallet storage, so he seems very "vulnerability focused."
BitPay does have a sleek Copay multi-sig wallet that I've enjoyed playing with. Tony Galippi gave a speech at their announcement saying how baffled he was when he conducted a survey of how many people were using multi-sig and it came up that a small, teeny tiny portion said yes. So they're very "mainstream multi-sig for the average anybody" focused.
As for the rest, you could drop big money on a Trezor with multi-sig functionality, but that's out of my league for now. I'll be getting one and toying around with it soon.
**However**, there's an interesting thing happening right now at Xapo. I read an article yesterday that said they keep customer bitcoins in a multi-sig vault. They generate five private keys offline and scatter them across five underground bunkers across the globe. One of the bunkers is underneath a Swiss mountain, the rest are confidential. In order for Xapo to pull funds out of your vault, they need three of five keys. So even if someone finds and compromises one of them, which they'd have to do physically because the servers stay offline and never touch the internet, ever, then they'd also have to physically locate three more and do the same thing.
You don't get to keep your private keys, but their storage sounds pretty damn theft-proof. Plus it's free. I haven't tested it myself, but I'm thinking of making the switch.
Let me know if you need anything else. Always happy to help :)

The point is, we shouldn't *have* to trust anyone. Multi-sig wallets exist so we can be issued one by a company, but never have to trust said company to keep our funds safe.
Trusting people is what got the financial world in the shape it is today. Same with all the bitcoin scandals. They all come down to a major factor: having to trust someone.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:50:08
There are downsides to Coinbase, no doubt. So don't take my word as gospel. I'm just here to help as best I can :)
Without knowing what the error was, I can only assume it was on the part of coin.mx. I could be wrong, but standard computer errors can't make the coins disappear if you were sending bitcoin, say, from Electrum to someone else.
However, one time I tried sending coins from ANXPro to my personal wallet and almost lost $170. Instead of copy and pasting my BTC address, I typed it in and messed up a single character. What can I say, I was young and reckless. 
Luckily, because it took a little longer to process, ANX was able to halt the transactions. I'm more than happy that they had a processing timeframe.
Keep in mind that instant may not mean secure. It's convenient, but there are always tradeoffs. I use Coinbase monthly and have had no quarrels. Their support has always helped me, although most of my questions are general inquiries. 
Circle is also apparently a good platform for easy, instant bitcoin buys. I've never experienced it myself. 
Also, depending on how instant you prefer, you may consider setting youself up on an exchange. I don't know who to recommend for that, but BTC-e, OKCoin and Kraken are three that people generally experience positive results with. Bitstamp just got hacked, but they're back online now. I'd give it a few weeks before going back there just to be safe.
And just general advice: Bitcoin is a new technology. If you're on the fence, only play with it with small amounts of money. The technology is secure but the user-experience is a little rough around the edges. There's a chance you'll have screwups and lose money on it, so only use bitcoin for what you're willing to lose. Don't invest your life savings in it. 
After you've learned the ropes with Electrum, consider getting a multi-signature wallet in a month. It's the most secure way to hold your bitcoins. Coinkite offers really easy multi-sigs (I say easy, but they aren't easy for the inexperienced) for free. BitPay also offers Copay, a multi-sig wallet that's pretty to look at and avaliable for mobile. 
It's a confusing world out there. Don't be afraid to ask for help. The bitcoin subreddit has some rough characters lurking who will criticize you, but a couple of us are trying to change that. Hence this long ass text post with too much information. :)
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:28:50
Yup, sounds like its on their side.
Person-to-person, Bitcoin is great. If I was sending coins directly to you then there would be no problems. But once you start using intermediaries, issues like this arise. 
The industry is growing. Give it 5 to 10 years and I think problems like this will be in the past.
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:43:47
Oh I know! Wasn't referencing OP, just the topic in general.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:26:47
I absolutely think multi-sig is the fundamental issue facing Bitcoin right now. With the technology as simple as its become, there should be little to no reason for everyone to have their funds in multi sig. 
Now there are issues with a few multi sig wallets right now that generate your keys online. That's still a problem. But I think this year things are going to get really good for multi sig tech and I think that adoption pressure from the community in will help a lot of people upgrade. Then the possibilities will start, like the ones you mentioned.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:24:48

I hear you. But as bitcoin gets more mainstream, that doesn't mean more regulation is the only option. There are a lot of things being developed right now, like Brawker, Bitsquare and Coinffeine, that decentralize the bitcoin to fiat process. The more time, promotion and effort put into them, the further away from regulation everything seems.

MTGox used to stand for **M**agic **T**he **G**athering **O**nline E**x**change. True story. They got into BTC when the getting was good and now we're here.

Wow. This is really cool. One thing I hate about XBL is that its a pull transaction, not a push. So if I only want a month I have to drag myself down to the store and buy a one month card. 
Sure, I could input my PayPal or debit card, but the process to cancel my account is unbearable. Microsoft wants their money with or without your permission. Looks like I'll be hooking myself up through bitcoin from now on :D

Alex Green/Ryan Kennedy. Man, that's been one hell of a story.

Still sucks. Sorry for your loss, sincerely.

Something tells me you should get a second reddit account and use it for personal opinions, making sure your company one is only for official business...

I'm a writer myself, but I suggest He's been a journalist for years and always cranks out great articles. A decent amount of his work comes out of Inside Bitcoins, and I think he'd be one of the most knowledgeable and well spoken writers for this project.

This guy knows what's up.

That's hilarious. Nah, they just introduced it today. Levine said its a long process, but he hopes its passed by Spring or Fall.
