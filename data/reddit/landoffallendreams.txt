It's supposed to increase the power to your PCI-e controller.
Basically just a molex to PCI-e 1x adaptor.

I'm not trying to promote the product (It looks pretty gimmicky to me), I just thought it was really neat to see GPU manufacturers finally speaking to their mining customer base (even if that customer base has left for ASICs by now).
@_date: 2014-01-31 19:32:15
I know, right? Not to mention that GPU mining for bitcoin (regardless of manufacturer) is totally pointless by now.
The product they're mentioning it for is just a molex to PCI-e 1x adaptor, anyway.

Mintchip is centralized.
It's not much closer to Bitcoin than the USD
@_date: 2012-08-19 16:23:40
What's wrong with a bubble?
It's simply people realizing that the product had been overvalued and correcting their ideas of value to better match the average agreed upon value.

I wouldn't base my decisions on that, however if a better system were to spring up I would certainly look into it and, if it achieved some level of success, might move over. I use bitcoins at least once a week and accept them at my local business.

No, that's deflation (inflation is when value decreases due to increased money supply). The article just words it poorly, implying that the fact that there is scarcity means it's deflationary.

I told my second-cousin's husband about bitcoin in June.
He and his wife bought at ~$80-90 and just sold at ~$240 in October.
If you think it's too late now you'll regret it when we go over $600.

We already have at least a half dozen, AFAIK. Won't an informed market gravitate towards a reasonably appropriate number of exchanges?
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:34:23
Idk why people are downvoting this post, you do make valid points in this one...
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:46:43
I think due to the ideals of much of the bitcoin community that they would just prefer decentralised exchanges over the current centralised ones.
I think some of the complaints are just overblown. People with a complaint are often more vocal than people who have a good experience, after all.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:46:47
As money is "a medium of exchange", you have made money since you can exchange the medium (bitcoin) for more of a product, service, or currency.

But also PayPal's over enthusiasm to comply. Selling mining equipment shouldn't be an issue, just bitcoins themselves.

Yknow when I wrote that comment I was thinking more along the lines of 2-6 months. Looks like we'll make it over $600 in under a week of that prediction.
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:07:56
They wouldn't all leave the source the same. Some exchanges would build off the source in different ways.
Even if they did leave it the same, it keeps one exchange from having too much power. Fragmentation is not an issue until aggregating the data becomes too difficult to easily accomplish for sites like bitcoincharts.com
@_date: 2013-07-03 20:41:03
well privateinternetaccess has overseas servers... since they don't log that should be good, right?

Calling Bitcoin "money" would make it illegal in some countries.
I assume this means it can't have "monetary value."

Faster confirmations is absolutely true! My recent credit card history shows "pending" for the past 3ish days of history.

Again, assuming Google will just ignore the illegality of it. What happens if they lose their domain address there because they piss off the government?

I, too, bought high ($112) and am a little bummed about the drop.
I've been mining, holding btc, and sometimes just watching the community and news for a couple years now, though. It'll go back up.
If you look at [this picture I whipped up]( you can see that we're about where we would be if the price had continued to rise at the same rate as it was before the bubble, though.

Unfortunately I don't know that I'm well enough educated as to the economics of the bitcoin exchange systems to answer your question. Hopefully someone more capable than I can help you find an answer to your query.

As I just posted in that thread, a cheap android phone, encrypted, with the free and open source bitcoin wallet app (downloads the headers only) would work, right?

The issue with the currency symbol is that it is shared with another currency.
Also it is not supported everywhere which is why currency systems have both a symbol and code.

No, it says they're hoping to hold bitcoins instead of selling them (at least some).

that doesn't make any sense to me...
the connection to PIA is encrypted (thus, not snoopable by the NSA unless they have unimaginable amounts of computational power all directed at breaking the encryption of a single connection) and the outbound traffic all comes from servers with multiple users.
all the NSA should be able to see is that some PIA user is access a server. They can't tell which user, AFAIK.

Or have them in a cold wallet/not accessible to others.

it's just a matter of semantics. it's traceable but simultaneously fairly anonymous.

Nothing has intrinsic value though, it's all just how much somebody wants it. Bitcoin is simply a less abusable alternative which is what makes it better.

There's an international organization that figures out the standards to use for things like monetary abbreviations. (USD for US Dollar, AUS for Australian dollar, etc) according to their standards XBC would be a more standards-compliant choice for the currency abbreviation.

Correct, but you should still trace the bitcoins themselves. It just wouldn't necessarily get you anywhere if they were laundered/put through an anonymiser.

The issue is that we don't have stagnation but rather a steady *decline* in price. This discourages people from hanging onto their coins which leads to a bit of a spiral of declining price.

I think of cold storage like a bank account for your money. You're keeping the "cash" you don't need accessible at a moment's notice in a more secure situation.
I just don't trust online wallets because of the past issues the bitcoin community has had. It's still money but it's not as much "yours" unless you have absolute control (I have trust issues)

Many companies who take Bitcoin immediately sell it. This can drive down prices at times and can be a less than optimal decision business-wise as the value may rise after they have sold.
Fiat currencies are currencies not backed by anything. This is most state-backed currencies such as the dollar, euro, etc. Currencies based on gold, crypto, or other independently verifiable things agent fiat currencies.

How so? I use bitcoin primarily as a currency and--very infrequently--as an investment. The only difficulty with this is that bitcoin is still young and thus has a small market cap and is therefore more volatile in the short term than a currency with a longer history such as the US dollar. This isn't a problem with bitcoin but merely the stage in which we find it.
