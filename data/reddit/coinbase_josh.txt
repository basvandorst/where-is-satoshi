Whenever a customer reports that their account has potentially been compromised, our first action is to disable all sign-ins to that account. This prevents any possible attacker from accessing customer funds during our investigation.
We have [extensive security measures]( in place to protect customer funds but we have to take account compromise reports very seriously.
If you could please send an email to support+reddit and include your reddit username I'll be happy to track down your case.

When a vault withdrawal is created, please be sure to check both your primary and secondary email addresses (as specified during the vault setup) for confirmation emails. It's necessary to approve vault withdrawals using *both* emails. You can see your secondary email address on the the vault withdrawal page.
Once that is approved, the 48 hour period begins.
If you still run into trouble, please PM me your case number or email support+reddit with your reddit username.

Have you confirmed the withdrawal from both the primary and secondary email addresses registered with your vault? To begin the 48 hour withdrawal period, both emails have to approve the withdrawal. Confirming the secondary email link works best if done from an incognito window or when you are not signed in to your Coinbase account. 
If this doesn't work, please contact support+reddit and we'll be happy to assist.

We are no longer able to support USD for certain international customers but are working to restore this as soon as possible. This would apply to Coinbase.com as well as GDAX (USD order books).

Hi kine1080 - thanks for integrating your app with the Coinbase API! 
I just wanted to chime in here on the "Debit an unlimited amount of money from your account" aspect. While this may be required for the app, users can also set limits from the Coinbase side via their linked app settings. This may help ease some minds with respect to the app having full access to funds. 
This can be done within a user's Coinbase settings on this page: 
If you click the "Settings" button for the StopCoin app after it has been linked, you can provide a value for "Allow this app to debit no more than XX per month." This is handled on Coinbase's side so there will be that extra layer of security for your funds.
This setting is available for most apps that require access to user's linked bank accounts.
Hope this helps!

Sorry about the frustrating experience. Sounds like there are few things to unpack:
**New device**: The scenario you describe can happen if your browser cache/cookies are cleared or if you're using a different browser even if you're using the same physical device. This can also happen if you're logging in from a different location which sounds like the case here. Device verification is a powerful security feature and since we prioritize security, this has to come as a tradeoff with convenience.
**Computer authorization error**: This typically occurs if you're clicking the verification link we've emailed you from a different device or browser than the one that was used to requested it. Please make sure to click the verification link from the same device/browser that you're trying to log in with.
**Sending BTC**: The best thing to do would be to email support+reddit so we can take a look at your specific account.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:08:20
That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you send us an email to support+reddit so we can take a look at your account?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:25:34
Coinbase Support here. Sorry for the trouble It's tough to tell without seeing your account, but in general, I'd recommend that you provide your old (invalid) number during the account recovery flow as you'll be able to enter a new number in subsequent steps. The account recovery process is designed to handle a variety of scenarios including lost Authenticator as well as phone number changes.

Since [we use ACH transfers]( (assuming you are based in the US), dollars only move during banking business days. Since this doesn't include weekends or holidays, the situation you describe sounds accurate. 
We always quote the delivery date prior to order confirmation and account for weekends/holidays in the timeframe provided. It also may depend on the time of day that you submit your order (so ordering late on a Friday means the transfer can't actually start until the next business day, for example). 
You can also use a credit/debit card for instant buys or fund your Coinbase USD Wallet with a same-day wire if you prefer. Hope this clarifies!

People _don't_ have to post on Reddit to get issues resolved. We get a lot of support volume and we're able to solve all issues using our normal support channels (email, live chat). People rarely post about the _good_ support they receive.
We can't always do it fast enough so posts on reddit happen for a tiny minority of cases. It's not ideal for anyone (it's another channel for us to monitor, it doesn't add value to the community, it's not great for our brand, and in the end results in us asking people to email us anyway (support+reddit
Regardless, our support team's goal is to resolve our customers' issues so it doesn't make sense for us to ignore posts like this.

Sorry for the trouble - we are working through the transaction backlog now and anticipate that it should be cleared out within the next few hours.
As some background, we had to restore some bitcoin from our cold storage which takes some time. It's a trade-off between security and speed. The issue is also compounded due to congestion in the Bitcoin network itself.
We're working on improving this process for the future - thanks for working with us on this one.

[Josh from Coinbase here]( Sorry for the trouble, Like Michael mentioned in [a similar thread]( there were a small number of bank debits which were made twice and Coinbase will absolutely make sure you are fully reimbursed. A refund should be available in your bank account early next week.
