"While the number of bitcoins is limited, the number of digital coins of any type is essentially unlimited, and there's no inherent reason to favor one over another, since they're all technically very similar. There's even a digital currency named after an Internet meme called Dogecoin with a market capitalization over $1 million. As the absurdity of that statement sets in, it's clear that Western Union has little to worry about on this front."

Just for the ones interested and because all the non bullish posts are allways banned in this subreddit, I will paste again what banterpanther explained very clear:
Bitcoin = Ponzi it is going to be banned soon everywhere:
Early adopters---- in @ $.0001/btc Newer adopters---- buys from earlier adopters for $.0010 Even Newer adopters---- buys from earlier adopters for $.01 etc etc etc
The btc mining system creates artificial price growth by increasing difficulty and lowering rewards.
Those at the top of the ponzi have the most btc for the cheapest price. Since they came first, they are more likely to control the majority of mined btc. All they have to do is sit on these btc, thus limiting the amount available and lowering the market liquidity. Since the btc has no inherent value (it doesn't physically exist and does not contain special properties or intellectual assets), and it doesn't generate income or produce any work, btc is only valued by what people will spend for it (like gold, but without the economic and manufacturing value of gold). Without liquidity, you can basically set whatever price you want, so long as you have a chump willing to buy it for your price . If you increase the amount of buyers and maintain a limited supply, you are incentive to inflate the price in order to sell for a profit to new buyers looking to get their first bitcoin(s). You are also quickly able to crash the market by merely introducing a few more coins than usual. I suspect some of the early adopters did this in the most recent crash... Imagine if the market is 200k coins, and you and your buddies own 90k that has never been circulated on the market before. And you see prices at $260/coin... you make a profit of $259 per coin since you were the first ones to adopt. You put as many coins on the market as possible, some others see this massive sale and buy in, others panic thinking its the end of the ponzi and sell... When the bloodshed is over, btc are worth $40. Tons of new buyers come in because they were waiting for cheaper btc after their friends told them about it. What do you do? BUY MORE BTC than you had before! You can now buy 5-6 btc for every one you sold at the top. Take the 100k btc you now own and take them out of the system, increasing the scarcity again for the next bubble, or start bidding up the market with high priced sell orders. Rinse, repeat.
The reason you shouldn't listen to people who own btc is because they are likely trying to inflate the prices more to make a profit on the btc they own. They want to increase the amount of people who come in, and the demand for it. They also want to make a quick buck before the next crash happens. Basically, btc is affiliate pyramid marketing 2.0. Some guy sells you the original idea, you find ways to increase demand in order to sell that idea for more money.
At the end of the day, a lot of money is taken/given, and nothing of value was actually provided.

WTF! Is this a joke? seriously?
Bitcoin is the less user friendly paying method I have ever seen so far... can you imaging the waitress waiting 10m for each client or having to deal with a dozen of QR addresses?!?! 
Nobody is going to be typing down passwords and waiting 10 min for I don't know how many confirmations!, I take out my VISA, give it to you and in 4sec I have paid. If something goes wrong, If I lose it, I ask my bank for my money back. No worries! I am ready to pay a 2% for that, no problem! 
GET REAL!!!!

Using that half a brain you will realize soon that a economy based on couple a million $ and less that 10 real companies bitpay, SD, coinbase... is not worth 1 billion... tears are going to be everywhere soon...

So your friends didn't buy at 260$ right? ;)
People do not like to gamble, it is fine if you do, but that is not the way to pay lunch. 
Do you think people care about giving up their SSN to the banks, when everybody are using gmail, facebook giving away all their privacy?
People want easy and fast solutions! not waiting 10min for confirmations, not using dozen of passwords...
Sorry for explaining you how the real world works.

Aunque para los españoles sea extraño hablar otros idiomas, no deberías dar por echo que en el resto del mundo solo sabemos hablar en inglés. España es el segundo país en número de tarjetas de la unión europea, por lo que es una excusa muy mala para justificar que sólo haya 3 establecimientos que admiten bitcoins. 
Los BTC no funcionan como moneda por su alta volatilidad, la economía bitcoin es un ejemplo de libro de un esquema ponzi. Pero si, hasta que esto explote, podéis seguir de paja en paja cada vez que abren un establecimiento que los utiliza...

As soon as china closes its exchanges the price will drop dramatically and that is something is going to occur soon as the chinesse law is clear at this point.
The USA will also close when it gets bigger.
Then, no matter if you have 4-5 small countries where it is legal, price will go down deep and fast...

The future is this:  tremendous growing in china. Ripple has all the power of bitcoin BUT it also complies with US AML requirements.
This will fast overtake bitcoins, reliable, robust and with Google behind...
It is not going to make you all rich, but it is going to help many people.

China is going to forbid BTC soon, as they did with QQ. They will close all the exchanges first, BTC will be soon over in Asia.
@_date: 2013-09-24 15:39:12

No more than a dozen early adopters holding 80% of the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-18 18:13:03

Very few people using it here, even being really easy and fast. 
Why anyone would bother to go from kroner to BTC? I do not see any advantages for using bitcoins in Norway. We don't have anyone printing billion of dollars here and it would rather have a stable money without that crazy volatility due to all the scammers around bitcoin industry.

This: As the government proved with online gambling and offshore accounts, you can suffocate any business without banning it by cutting off money transfers.
Tradehill is out of the game, Mtgox will die in a matter of days, Bistamp is going to be close soon as it is violating a dozen of european rules... (remember bicoin24h, the biggest european exchange)

from the future: 
on 2013 mtgox and tradehill were closed by the USA authorities, then european and asian authorities followed the american rules while bitcoin slowly decreased, until 2017 it was still used for SR and a couple of casinos
on 2016 a new and usable crypto was proposed by several usa banks and several internet related companies which is now used by many different countries under the usa authorities supervision.
@_date: 2013-10-14 13:28:55

No, tulips are not for me, sorry ;)
I make real and very good money working for real companies that are making the future of payments a reality, Vodafone to be precise. Thank god our millions of clients enjoy quality and robust solutions. 
All I can see going on through these posts, is a bunch of kids making richer some early adopter in a ponzi like dangerous scheme and that worries me.
Be very careful and good luck, time will tell...
