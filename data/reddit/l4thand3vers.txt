His name is Greek and it does sound like he has a very light Greek accent. Idk however if he actually speaks Greek or is bilingual. My guess would be that he does and that what you're hearing is a hint of a Greek accent, but I don't really know.

Ok. That sounds interesting but I still don't get it. After the usb returns to the main computer, it has a signed transaction. From what I understand, I can't tamper with that, and once it gets added to the blockchain, those bitcoins belong to a new address.
Maybe I'm too slow for this :P

Really? I'm not some elite cyber-warrior. I just got lucky. He had a publicly accessible, badly secured sshd and then I keylogged his password when he used sudo. Simple stuff so far. But island-hopping to an offline computer is a bit above my level.
My general thoughts so far is that it would be super neat if I could get him to execute something from the usb when it's mounted on the rpi. But he's going to be looking out for that sort of thing, and raspbian doesn't automatically execute stuff like windows used to do.

Totally speculating here but,  
There's a bunch of international tech companies with offices in Brno, most notably IBM and Red Hat. So maybe it's all these tech people who are interested in bitcoin.

I completely agree with what you just said. I would also like to add that the previous argument ("we should give money to the poor instead of X") has another problem.

Then I guess you also don't know that you can use symetric encryption with gpg.
From the manual:
    --symmetric
       -c     Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The default symmetric cipher used is CAST5, but may be chosen with the --cipher-algo option. This option may be
              combined with --sign (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), --encrypt (for a message that may be decrypted via a  secret  key  or  a  passphrase),  or
              --sign and --encrypt together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).
So to be more precise. If you wanted to encrypt your file named supersecret you would do:
    gpg -c supersecret
Then you are prompted twice for a password and finally it spits out the encrypted supersecret.gpg. To decrypt it:
    gpg -d supersecret.gpg
EDIT: Also, just in case you're thinking "Ok, l4than-d3vers, that's all fine but I want to encrypt an entire folder.". Well that's not a question but if it were the answer would be `tar`

Exchanging unprotected private keys is definitely a bad idea. However, the way I understand it, with someone making coins and then sealing the priv-key under a tamper-proof sticker, you still have to trust the issuer but only the issuer.

As with all things, people give it value, value being inter-subjective.
EDIT: I think language is a useful analogy. What gives language meaning?

It is people who give language meaning.

TL;DR **It can be extremely hard to 'seize' bitcoins.**
How exactly do you seize bitcoins? The only way you could effectively 'seize' bitcoins would be to transfer them to an address you control. If they just copied some wallet files, they haven't seized shit, for two reasons.
* Wallets are usually encrypted by default. You can have a copy of my wallet and if you don't have the decryption key/passphrase, you have nothing. You can't sign any transactions (i.e. spend the bitcoins).
* There is no way to definitively know whether someone else has a copy of the wallet and the passphrase to decrypt it, giving them the ability to send/spend the bitcions.
And finally, if some other party, or the accused themselves, has access to a copy of the wallet, they can send/spend the bitcoins with complete deniability.

I'm guessing eff.org would not like to be associated with a group like defcad [for similar reasons why they don't accept bitcoin donations]( Also, I imagine defcad would, for the same reasons, prefer to support an environment that has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to produce acts of a subversive and revolutionary nature, with little to no regard for "fully understanding the complex legal issues involved with" DDOSing sites and hacking people they judge to be assholes. 
In other words, the kind of person that would support the eff would be the kind of person supporting the nra - a person acting within the system. The way I understand it, that's not what defcad is about.

If you are using the [original bitcoin-qt software]( to encrypt your wallet just got to `Settings &gt; Encrypt Wallet` from the top menu. Extracting your private keys from bitcoin-qt is a bit trickier but possible. You should however be very careful about where you store those.

Provided your wallet is encrypted (which is usually the case) it should be safe to store it anywhere. Just be sure that you will have actual access to it. Don't just leave your coins at some online service, and of course make a few copies (such as for example, on a cheap usb stick). 
If you have a real computer, your best option is to use one of the "software wallets" [here]( Otherwise, use an online service that allows you to extract your wallet. For more general info try the links on the sidebar.
