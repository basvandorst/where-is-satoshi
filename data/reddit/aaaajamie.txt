funny how no one can answer OP directly. it's a simple question.

I don't know why you're getting downvotes instead of answers

noob question: if i convert lets say for example 5400 usd into 1 BTC now, then i pay the lowest fees, and then it gets confirmed 3 hours from now where the conversion is 1 BTC = 10800 USD (just an example), would i buy 1 BTC or 0.5 BTC? Thanks!

Hi I would just like to ask, I'm a little lost. I transferred my balance from an exchange into mycelium. My balance in the exchange was 50-50 split (50% BTC and 50% usd) and when i transferred them to mycelium, it was combined into one total balance. I notice that since half of it is in usd originally, its value is static and is not affected by the increase in BTC value. how do change this usd balance to BTC? when i try to send my balance, it appears that i can send my BTC balance :( how do i take out my usd balance? 
 
EDIT: never mind, they got combined all this time. :) My only concern now is: why is it bad to save your balance on an exchange?
