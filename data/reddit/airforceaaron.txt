You're right! It is plummeting! It's only up 1,000% over the last year and 5,000% since I purchased. I should definitely sell this underperforming asset immediately!

Check out Wanchain. We may be closer than many think.

If people are using lightning, the on chain fees will not be $30. The mempool will clear out as users switch to lightning and we will see cheap txs on chain again.

These people that are asking you about bitcoin still have no idea what it really is. All they know is that is gone up in value exponentially. Shit, most people who are buying now still don't know what it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:55:23
It will be when they don't have to know what it is. Most technologies are a complete mystery to the end user. All they care about is that it works. Ask a random person off the street how their car works or the mechanics behind how they stream Netflix on their smart TV. All they care is that it works and solves a problem. It will become ubiquitous.

Hilarious! I had an almost identical situation except it was the father in law and his 5 siblings (2014). He just ordered his trezor yesterday and got in at $12k
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:12:45
Agreed. Switching this weekend. I have been thoroughly dissatisfied with coinbase/gdax for years. They are always down during price swings and now this shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:52:46
I'm up 10,000% and still not reducing my position. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:17:35
This made my brain hurt. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:14:37
I actually sold several of these on ebay years ago. It wasn't worth it. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 23:53:42
Already exists with trezor. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:03:29
Most miners are part of a pool because of the extreme difficulty of actually solving a block. The pool then pays them a proportional reward. This means that essentially only pool operators benefit from freshly minted coins with no ledger history. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 00:27:37
And they wouldn't have to give the wallet back either. As long as you had the seed you could restore your hidden coins with a new trezor.

Amazing! This is crazy.  Thank you! 12 years in the Air Force. I can already see how this technology could be useful to us.

Can't wait for FB integration.  I think we will truly see change tip explode.  I have so many friends that are interested but won't take the leap because the is no real perceived incentive for them to get bitcoin.  I will be sending out $10-20 tips to all my FB friends. Happy holidays bitches!

People fear what they don't understand. Simple as that.  That fear has many manifestations such as fear, hate etc.

I'm buying pizza tonight at Two Dogs Taproom in Tokyo. They have the best pizza! If there is any interest i will post pics and share my experience.

I love this! Agreed.
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:10:14
Outstanding! I tipped Andreas $1 during the Bitcoin bowl because I knew people would be more willing to accept his $5 tips and actually set up an account. I felt it was the best way for me to spread tips.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:09:37
You're probably right.  I'm sure that NYSE, USAA and BBVA did no due diligence before investing $75M in Coinbase. I'm sure this won't bolster user adoption in the slightest.  You should probably sell all your coins now while they still hold any value. That is assuming you have coins and you're not just a troll....
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:27:56
Had to use changetip tech support to resolve an issue. They were awesome! I asked about FB integration and this was the response:
 "Hi Aaron,
FB tipping is in the works and we'll announce its availability as soon as it's ready. Happy tipping! :)"
This could help drive adoption in a major way! 
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:54:39
I tipped a good friend of mine $5 last weekend when we were having beers at a bar.  I was trying to explain Bitcoin to him the best I could. I think the change tip confused him more. He collected the tip but I have a feeling that's where it will end unfortunately. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:47:34
Wow, thanks!

This.         I have 3 antminer S4s that were given to me and free electricity and I've considered turning them off just because of the heat/noise. The only reason they are still on is because I feel I am doing my small part to support the network. Home mining is dead.

I've been paying my two daughters allowance in BTC for about 2 years now. They will probably never have a traditional bank account or a relationship with a bank.

Usually I buy more than I spent. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:55:37
So you did. I haven't had my coffee yet this morning. I see it now. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:38:12
This is all irrelevant anyways. Even if Bitcoin were equally distributed, within a few decades the wealth distribution would look approximately the same as it does now (assuming people actually use bitcoin as a payment system in the future). This is a law of human nature and is independent from the currency being used. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:46:23
No, I wouldn't do it if I thought it would cause problems. They have money to spare. Besides the last time I bought for him BTC was $270.
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:13:22
Yay! Reddit coins! 
@_date: 2019-01-14 05:15:18
Stable coins are only stable pegged to the US dollar. That defeats the purpose of a store of value. One of the promises of Bitcoin and other cryptos is that they are deflationary because of their fixed supply. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 04:51:44
Just because you can divide something into smaller fractions doesn't increase the total supply. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 09:46:29
My father in law just emailed me asking if I would buy him another 1 BTC.

True story: My 5 yo niece opened a "young savers" account with her local bank with her parents help. It was a $5 min to open that account. Her dad (my brother) deposited the $5 to get her going with the intent of adding more over time. One month later and the first statement came. She had exactly $0 as her bank charges a $5 maintenance fee on the account. They literally stole $5 from a little girl... The worst part is that this program was advertised through her elementary school.

Call me a cynic and down vote if you must but the SEC doesn't care about our comments on this. There were tons of great comments when the Winkis ETF was being considered and they still disapproved.

Market cap and new capital are not the same. $10B of new money will raise the market cap much more than $10B.

How do I know what? 
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:18:35
"then" or "than"? Words are important. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:37:20
This is true, however most people aren't technically capable of securing their own keys and they don't want to. I'm OK with this. To each their own. They just want exposure to the price and as new money flows in the price rises creating a network effect. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:36:12
Whoop whoop!

I think this will help Bitcoin tremendously. Once people are comfortable using fedcoin they will be much more comfortable using/holding other crypto currencies. It will also dramatically speed up the exchange in and out of Bitcoin. No more waiting four days for wire transfer. I think fedcoin could be Bitcoins killer app. Any inefficiencies in a centralized fedcoin (and there will be many) will highlight the strengths of the decentralized Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:36:57
Yeaaahhh, if we could go ahead and have decentralized exchanges now that would be greeaattt, umm kay.

@_date: 2015-02-20 01:02:49
Well they don't ever charge the card unless you instant by and don't have the funds to cover it. So in theory you could give them a credit card and once you have instant buy access you could cancel the card and basically steal $1000 worth of Bitcoin. I don't recommend that though...

Your first investment should be in your education of how the technology works. Learn how it works and how to safely secure your private keys. Only then should you buy.
Read The Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos. There are also many great YouTube videos by Andreas.

That's my point. I was expecting the price to continue to fall. I suppose I'll have to wait a bit longer for the correction.

I would pay per play if the amount were trivial. Something like $0.005
