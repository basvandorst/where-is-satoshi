Dumb question. Can I buy these futures and hold them some way? Like being a holder just with futures?
Like I know this is not what futures are. But is there a trick to do this? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:07:10
Try getting another bank. Maybe fidor of u can get an account there. Or else who in Europe.

Es ist in der Tat so, dass es seit ein paar Tagen nicht mehr möglich ist mit Bitcoins zu bezahlen, da Lieferservice seit ein paar Tagen direkt zu Lieferando weiterleitet.
Da Sie nicht der einzige Kunde sind, der sich diesbezüglich bei uns gemeldet hat, ist die entsprechende Abteilung darüber schon informiert worden.
Wir können Ihnen jedoch leider noch nicht sagen, ob und wann es denn dann möglich sein würde, mit Bitcoins auf unserem Portal bezahlen zu können.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:34:28
But bitcoin.de is p2p so I get my money directly from the seller? 
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:54:22

@_date: 2014-07-21 18:20:41
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:40:13
if only 10 euro per bet then I guess that is not much, but article does not mention that, nor does the website (as a not registered person i couldn't find much info on the website)
but I guess everything has to start somewhere... still good that a real bank is friendly towards bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-23 11:41:57
I think it would be great if they exist at airports.
Both selling and buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:56:38
IAMA? and plz some donation link!
 
 found on her facebook group? is it hers? (and her youtube video)
@_date: 2015-05-18 12:08:03
yeah, even arab christians and atheists say it...
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:51:25
Well I do think it is important in general for real banks to promote bitcoins. 
But I agree if what you say is true it is not as important as I thought and I would change the title if I could since "derivatives" is a bit over the top even though they do use that as a keyword for their website. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 07:12:05
buy more and tip more then price will rise
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:46:41
a game with real money though
@_date: 2015-05-22 07:29:49
well some artists you can't actually buy anything especially if they are just making mixes which is still a lot of work
and paypal is...
it's very easy for me donating via change tip, but I guess in reality not yet that easy for more artists to redeem it. It isn't hard for them but they have to get into it first I guess..
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:26:59

Imagine a simple and intuitive CryptoCurrency price app that focused more on price (what you care about) than a million meaningless statistics (that only Warren Buffet needs). Imagine an interface packed with features, but clean and simple. Imagine support for 12 languages - use the app no matter what language you speak. Imagine checking the price or converting between 23 world currencies and bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, peercoin, and more without missing a beat. Now, stop imagining.
CryptoCalc 2 is here, with more features then ever! 
Our gorgeous new interface is even better than before - but still easy to use and simple.
Smart alerts keep you up-to-date on bitcoin price throughout your day - no need to open the app, and without being annoying or battery killing. The new Morning Briefing unobtrusively alerts you to the bitcoin price when you first unlock your phone in the morning. The app’s badge updates throughout the day to reflect the live price: without killing your battery.
With 23 world currencies and bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, peercoin, and bitcoin bits, you can get exchange rates no matter where you live, where you are traveling, what currency you use, or anything else.
Support for 12 languages lets nearly anyone use this app - the app natively supports Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Greek, Finnish, French, Italian, German, Russian, Danish, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Hebrew!
All this and much more makes CryptoCalc the app we have all been waiting for - so go ahead and download today!

no problem. I tipped some local bands/djs the more high amounts, I even know some of they guys playing in them. None were redeemed. I am guessing cause they don't check soundcloud a lot. I will be asking them when I see them next time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:11:55

Well it's basically one of the most visionary films of the century, I mean they are actually celebrating bitcoin reaching 4000 $ in a Bollywood movie from 2015 when no one could have imagined that happening.

While I was studying a few years ago for like four exams in one week, cramming my brain, it was the horror, I really literally forgot my phone pin which I entered like once a week for two years before.

@_date: 2015-07-11 06:33:10
i hope to get there as well!
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:24:13
Locally in Germany many actually use bitcoins to pay suppliers. No source I can offer. But I friend a mine works in the police force and told me this. 
Funny thing is he was never interested in bitcoin and started asking me about them two years ago all of a sudden. That's when he told me he was investigating a Drug dealer who used bitcoins to pay his dealer in Holland.  
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:13:34
Source for those specific Infos?
Googled 
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:35:02

"and is often used as a guide to official policie"
so i would conclude thats pretty huge...
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:25:28
nice, isn't this de facto an atm where you can just buy bitcoins!
of course you would need a wallet before buying some
