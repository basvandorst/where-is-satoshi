@_date: 2017-08-03 01:43:35
You probably already know this but don't store on any exchange what you cant afford to lose or don't care if that exchange magically disappears

Yeah but you won’t notice the money in the bank as quickly as your bitcoin going down when you need to pay them bills. Keep the money in the bank for spending bitcoin is just a risky investment 
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:09:28

Coinbase, Cex.io or Gemini are the most popular. Coinbase did have issues earlier this week but I have just sent a few transactions and they hit the network almost instantly. Edit: Also you better buy now they will be freezing transactions soon. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:40:23
Your going to miss the boat or should I say rocket ship. I dont think you will see a dip August 1st. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:59:54
