My family is trying to tell me I don't have room for investments in BTC either, but i honestly think you're an idiot if you don't. It might mostly be composed of speculation right now, but there's enough venture capital in it right now that you'd be stupid NOT to invest. Especially since the price is so low. I knew better when it was still $430, and that's when i bought my first piece of BTC. I honestly think we might see 10,000 by the end of the year. Wall Street is dipping their toes right now... but once they jump in it's going to be chaos. Although it will skyrocket the price... i wish it would maintain itself the way it is now; stable, predictable, and not over hyped, trudging along just like it should.

Everyone was expecting a bubble, but it didn't happen BECAUSE it was everyone's expectation. Simple. That's the irony of how markets move, usually pretty backwards. Now we're seeing a decline. It's not surprising me in the least bit, albeit I'm not without disappointment. :/

Ive noticed some irony in the wall street nay-sayers that chastise bitcoin; it seems as though theyre just as fanatical and obsessive as the BTC community is. Only... Theyre obviously on the losing side. BTC is clearly in its infantile stages, but it is decentralized, has very little transaction costs, is the cheapest method of storing wealth known to human kind (so far), and is entirely constructed with security in mind. The idea thay bitcoin is "a bubble" is the most absurd thing ive ever heard in my life. If bitcoin dies, so will humanity and its capacity for innovation. Bitcoin is nothing more than the next step in efficient and civilized infrastructure, plain and simple. While it may be volatile now,in the long-term, it will prove to be invaluable. It already has, technically. We just have a bunch of archaic Neanderthals who only pretend to know what theyre talking about criticising it.

Here we go with all this non-sense libertarian voodoo talk. I get so tired of this. Tacky opinion articles like this shouldn't be on Bitcoin's front page! 
... You know what I mean: Reddit is the place to be for all of the best info on BTC. I'm so ashamed of the community, I feel like we are part of the problem of the public's perception of bitcoin.

damn you beat me to it. Apparently this news is about 3-4 days old, but it's just now popping up in the mainstream news. I wounder if this large increase in mining operations has helped to drive the price down? anybody care to comment on the idea?
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:08:11
Knowing who the real Satoshi is, is important because the "Real" Satoshi holds the largest amount of bitcoin on the entire network, and he could very easily become a billionaire over night whilst simultaneously annihilating the bitcoin network - (mainly it's value really) - by selling all of those coins at once. That is, if he still has access to them anyways. It matters because knowing who it was would allow us to judge the character of Bitcoin's creator and understand whether or not he/she/they had the capacity and willingness to do such a thing. I like to think he wouldn't sell out and turn this entire market into a farced ponzi scheme of massive proportions, but the reality is that this possibility still remains and is very precarious... Or did you forget about that? I HOPE it really is "Szabo", because he seems like a man of good character that wouldn't, but we still can't be sure.

It pehaps might, but you must also consider the added cost of electricity thats added on top of it. (Unless you get that paid). As others have stated, you shouldnt even attempt mining unless you have an ASIC. (Application Specific Integrated Circuit.) The hash rate is too dificult to get a cost effective result. Plus youll burn out your computer making it run such a heavy workload. My advice is that you should only get into it if youre serious about understanding computer parts and how they all operate and function.

Did I say that I believed it was correct? Stop being a presumptuous ass hole and insulting people before you even bother making an attempt at understanding their message. It's a theory, not an exact science. Did I even come close to saying I believed it was accurate? I was just making an observation, not an assertion. Furthermore, I was making a digression just for fun, and I wasn't implying anything. I was moreover just pointing out that "Public perception does not equal reality" is not a true statement in all facets of life, not justifying it as a legitimate grounds for this voodoo price prediction experiment.

The trend lines on the downward wedge pattern in Bitcoin's price fluctuation have basically converged; thus making it difficult for the sellers to push the price down. 
The pattern was clear as day and i knew it was going to start rising again, or at least stabilize (Unless another irrational scare popped up that would make people who were'nt planning on selling do so). i don't know why more people weren't pointing it out. No telling where the price is going to go now, but only for the time being. The assumption i can surmise is that it's going to continue to break upwards, until another pattern in the chart comes to light. Probably another wedge pattern.

If you spent that much in buying bitcoin itself you would have made more money. OR by trading altcoins on cryptsy. Also, mining bitcoin isn't profitable anymore, unless you have giant ASIC servers running in multitudes. If you want to make money off of scrypt mining, you're better off actually buying a SCRIPTminer, NOT a BTC miner. (There is a big difference). But, again, you're likely to make more money, and make it much faster, by merely buying and selling/trading coins.

I can't believe they're still trying to classify it as property and not a currency. 
Unfortunately, I don't remember ever fucking buying anything with property/bartering goods. I can't believe they're still doing this shit.
Are we supposed to be proud of them that they didn't make one of the dumbest decisions I've ever seen? Sales tax on a currency? If they did that I'd be busting down the fucking door of their office telling them to find some fucking brains to use since they obviously don't have any. Honestly, these people should be fired for their stupidity, not commended for running around and making noise like chickens with their heads cut off.

Do your best to just sit on that cash as a long term investment. Hopefully, if the infrastructure behind bitcoin develops on track with the way it has been so far, you'll be able to retire by selling it in 20 years. It's all chance, but it looks like that's where bitcoin is still headed so far, price fluctuations aside.

@_date: 2015-01-14 12:47:41
Why I got into bitcoin in the first place? To make money, and support the ecosystem of it. I sold all my coins and stopped my losses at $380, so I don't have to worry about losing money, and I fully intend on buying back in when it's done crashing. Also, the system itself isn't going anywhere no matter where the price is at. I don't care, frankly, at all about the price, except for a trading perspective; but I don't have to worry about that since I already sold. 
So what if the price crashes? It's just a sign that all the sharks manipulating the market are finally losing confidence and dropping out so that we - the individuals who actually believe in the ecosystem and are backing it for what it stands for, and not just because we want to make a quick buck off of it - can gain control and have some equity in the market again. Rest assured, the sharks have had almost complete control over the market so far. I just see this as good news, despite the complete and utter ignorance of the mass media's perception on BTC.

You know what? This may be what the sharks are thinking, and this is why they launched a signifigant attack on the price today... because they want it to reach bottom ASAP and stop capitulating.
And rest assured, individual buyers have very little effect on the market. It's almost entirely up to large sharks to decide where the market moves with the state bitcoin is in right now.
Either that, or there's some insider news that's about to circulate that the public hasn't gotten a hold of yet.

In a word: it's not. It won't be for a long time. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.)
