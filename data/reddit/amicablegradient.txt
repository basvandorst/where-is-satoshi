Unlike dollars which can only be divided into cents and gold which can only be divided into atoms, bitcoin can be divided infinitely. The current limit is 100 millionths (known as sats), but there are already workarounds to allow sats to be subdivided (e.g. Lightning Network) and the protocol could be upgraded to allow native sub-division of sats. Basicly, so long as one Bitcoin remains in circulation that bitcoin can be sub-divided to allow everyone to own some fraction of it. 
Economically.... a whale that size might put some people off.

The Bitcoin protocol is upgraded through a formal process known as Bitcoin Implementation Proposals (BIP). Anyone can submit a BIP and campaign for it's inclusion. The deciding factor in which BIPs get chosen for implementation are the node holders and the developers that they get their client from. If developers are willing to implement a specific BIP and Node Holders are willing to run clients that include a specific BIP, then (excluding a fork) the BIP is implemented. 
If there is a fork (i.e. A BIP that is not backwards compatible), then the BIP goes through one more campaign stage; convincing end users to trade out on the old fork and trade into the new one.
Here's an old article on the subject:

Coinjoin, MimbleWimble and segwit are three examples of BIP's on their way to implementation. (Segwit is currently running on ~%40 of nodes) Plus BCH came into existence as a fork through the BIP process.
So BIP's do happen and Lightning Network already allows sending fractions of a Sat.

Hard drive platters are relatively indestructible, so 99 out of 100 times it's a drive head failure. Fixing that involves picking the drive open, removing the current head assembly and replacing it with a new one from a donor drive. You'll also need to find the chip on the control board that calibrates the drive head (each platter has a unique 'factory set' head calibration) and swap that chip over from the donor drive. 
Moving drive heads around requires specialist tools and it is skilled labour. The head is basicly a small magnet attached to an arm by a very flimsy carriage.

From what I understand, you have to send the BTC (to yourself) to retrieve any forks. This would lower the number of BTC contained in the coin (transaction fees) and you would have to break the hologram to retrieve the key, deprecating the physical value of the coin.

Bitcoin can be modified to be infinitely divisible. Instead of modifying the code to add more coins into circulation, you can modify the code to sub-divide a satoshi. So long as a single coin remains in circulation, that coin can be subdivided to maintain adequate fungibility.

MMT is based on the idea of a captive market. If the local shop only accepted bananas then every local would be paying in bananas. The rise of consensus value in mediums of exchange can all be explained in this way. Some form of body, be it shop / exchange / government, sets the value for a medium of exchange and everyone is forced to accept consensus on that value.
Crypto is different by taking it a step further back. Rather than looking at what defines value for a collective it looks at what defines value for an individual. Gold, beads, shells, (bananas) all existed as some form of collectible prior to existing as a currency. It's by leveraging an individuals desire to collect something that allows that thing to achieve value without consensus. If enough individuals value the thing then consensus value spontaneously arises and is further enforced by the methods outlined in MMT.

I can't imagine the market would have been able to handle a $15,323 buy order. Especially seeing as all trades were OTC, Satoshi held ~50% of all available coin, and there were only 2-4 million coins in existence. 
Lady Gaga with 16,333 coins (0.4% of market)
Beyonce with 20,787 coins (0.5% of market)
Madonna with 34,447 coins (0.8% of market)
J.K. Rowling with 59,393 coins (1.5% of market)
Oprah Winfrey with 178,179 coins (4.4% of market)
Elon Musk with 1,235,374 coins (30% of market)
Everyone below Elon would have to possess more bitcoins than existed at any point during 2010.
e.g. Zuckerberg with 4,216,903 coins (105% of market)

Governments moved to Fiat because physical object prices were too unstable. So imagine something like MKR / DAI. Instead of using unstable ethereum, it would use unstable mortgage agreements. A government currency backed by unstable assets, but using a share buying / selling system to control inflation / deflation and forge a stable economy.

Bitcoin difficulty is created by two factors.
1: The natural increase in difficulty of hashing.
2: The manipulated difficulty to obtain a steady blockchain.
Since the bitcoin block reward only halves when the natural difficulty increases, we can infer the exact magnitude with which the difficulty has increased since 2009 when the entire blockchain was maintained by at most 10 PCs.....
i.e. TWO TIMES. 
Do The math. 10 x 2 x 2
If everyone stopped mining, then the entire blockchain could be run on the G/Hash rate of 40 PCs (from 2009). All the extra power being consumed by block chain is one gigantic engine revving for the sole purpose of mining pools and companies to outcompete each other on noise generated. The blockchain is repeatedly artificially (and entirely unnecesarily) increasing the difficulty for the sole purpose of keeping block generation steady in the face of overwhelming processing power.

I don't think so. 
Firstly an exchange is a public forum for the completion of buy / sell orders. Automating those orders through the use of smart contracts doesn't change that. (p.s. etherdelta.com is clearly set up as an exchange)
Secondly the 'address' is a legal entity. As outlined in the white paper, the obfuscation of ownership is purely for privacy. It is not meant to bypass ownership laws. That ownership can be convoluted through mining pools / commercial mining / trusts / etc. but all of these entities have binding agreements that establish ownership of any assets they acquire. 
Thirdly lack of regulation does not mean you can ignore legal obligations. A binding agreement is innocent until proven guilty. It is legal until proven illegal. Bitcoin may use maths to outline and fulfil it's binding agreement, but it is nowhere near the legally grey area that the article above makes it out to be. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:01:29
The device you described was installed by a legal entity and is therefore the legal obligation of that legal entity. It does not just spontaneously appear on top of an anonymous apartment building. 


Think of regulators as like referees in basketball. You can play basketball without a referee, but if you assault a member of the other team you still broke the law. You can't turn round to the arresting officer and claim that it was only part of the game. 
The same thing goes with other laws such as fraud. Lots of industries are regulated to prevent fraud, but if an industry has no regulator that doesn't make fraud legal. 


A binding agreement between all participants. The participants are the legal entities. A wild lion is not controlled by anyone, but setting one loose on your neighbourhood would make you responsible as you participated in putting it there.

The 'cost' to secure the network is meaningless. For the first few days of it's existence bitcoin successfully ran on a handful of PC's. Let's say 10-100. Since then the difficulty has doubled twice. So bitcoin 'costs' the computing power of 40-400 PC's*. Everything on top of that is hot air designed to prevent a 50% attack. 
If a PoS network is at risk of a 50% attack then changing to a PoW system will not change that (and vice versa). 
*40-400 PC's from 2010 with no gpu mining.

ICO's have the potential to replicate a wide variety of financial offerings. BTCUSD is a blockchain pegged to a fiat asset. So blockchain could be pegged to anything. Shares, bonds, gold, you name it and I bet it's possible. If every company had a blockchain pegged 1:1 with it's own shares then blockchain would replace wallstreet. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:07:24
The costs have to be trivial because Etheruem is fast approaching it's fixed cap. When PoS goes live, there will be nothing left in ethereum to mine and the only value for the miners will be in fees. Fees that are augmented by a betting system that distributes the house-take to the miners. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 10:13:22
Throttle the miners. 
(Softly and gently, by p2p signalling of how oversaturated any one coin is to allow the total G/Hash rate required to be divided across the total available pool ensuring that every miner has an equal opportunity based on their total Hash ouput, while allowing them to dedicate that excess hash to other coins)
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:00:21
Lightning network makes hodling even more interesting, generate fees while hodling and increase fungibility while your at it. 
So long as one bitcoin is in circulation, that coin is infinitely subdivisible to meet the needs of the market. Supply restrictions do not impact fungibility.

High risk of scam. 
Free tickets is a well known loophole to evade gambling legislation. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:11:12
PoS is just another interpretation of PoW. Instead of using a hashing algorithm to generate work, they run a gambling algorithm which generates just as much work. It requires a more complicated solution to be implemented, but it is potentially viable.
Due to the nature of PoW, even Bitcoin may one day require an upgrade to move past the logic bomb of mining for numbers smaller than 0. So long as the work involved is sufficiently complex, anything can be used to fulfil the work obligation. 
I like to hope that before that happens bitcoin will gain enough universal acceptance that a PoA system can be used. (PoA = Hashing to discover the address with the most coins at the time of hashing) Unfortunately, a PoA system counts non-existing addresses as having 0 coins, and the number of address that have more than 0 coins is a very small percentage at the moment. Not enough to be more efficient than finding the address with the most 0's in it. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:53:07
The work done in PoS is the collection of bets (consuming bandwidth) and the calculation of odds (consuming processor time) Both of these incur a cost.

I rekcon we might not be through the bear winter yet. The bulls still need to pull it up to the previous ATH before a real bubble gets momentum. That's a lot of ground to make up. 
You can see this in the aftermath of the 1k bubble. It took 3 years for it to claw it's way back to 1k but as soon as it did it went over 10x that in under a year. 
*So it's a major milestone for investors. Seeing that you could have messed up and bought at the height of the bubble, sat on it, and still broke even.

My little brother had a similar problem, turned out he'd been using the now defunct Multibit wallet. Getting the privkey out was a bit of a hassle, but we got there eventually. See if you can find out from your friend what wallet program he was using. Some of those earlier wallets used in house formats to store keys, so the 'wallet' file would only be accessible from the app that generated the wallet.

Proof of Stake could let a small cabal directly influence the mining pool. Any attempts to fork power away from the cabal would be ineffective because the new fork is also proof of stake and on that fork the cabal owns the same percentage of the total coin.
*edit for clarity
Proof of stake: one coin = one vote
Proof of work: one node = one vote
So in a proof of work system you need to own a majority of the hashing power to control the system. In a proof of stake system you need to own the majority of the coin to control the system.
