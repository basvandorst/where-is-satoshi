it's not a crypto wallet or exchange, its main use is a "bank account".. when i moved to UK from South Africa 6 months ago i couldn't get a UK bank account without a Proof of residence, and couldn't get that without a bank account.. it fixed that issue easily. could easily get a place &amp; pay rent using it until i had enough utlity bills for a UK bank account.

except you cant use bitcoin cash ANYWHERE... where even here in my shitty 3rd world country just about everywhere accepts bitcoin :/ So even though i have absolutely have nothing against bitcoin cash, i just cant be interested in it.. since it has no real world applications.

good question, by what metric?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:58:12
Thats the question of investing isn't it. Do you have a job? are you homeless? can your family eat everyday? the answer to those 3 should determine your choice.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:25:50

thing is you cant spend it anywhere.. so obviously the transactions are much cheaper. literally nowhere of worth accepts it.

howso? btc i can pay my rent, buy groceries, ticket to the opera, rent a car, buy a train ticket / plane ticket in the UK, pay for nice hotels in europe. what can bcash offer me? serious question, what exactly can i do with it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:23:37
thing is you cant use it anywhere, iv used btc for many years for its practical uses, all the sites here in south africa take bitcoin, my landlord takes bitcoin, i buy my groceries with bitcoin ect ect i cant exactly use it now unless i want to pay a stupid high fee.. it's in a bad spot.

Iv heard most UK banks will freeze your account if you do a large deposit from an exchange, they will ask for a KYC which is a contridiction of bitcoin. 
A friend of mine tried to unload 10 bitcoins into Barkley and the only KYC he had was proof he owned the bitcoins for 6ish years with wallet screenshots, that wasnt good enough.

guessing you're a comfy 1st worlder. try living in a 3rd world where banks often close bank accounts because they are falling on hard times. been using bitcoin for many years for rent, groceries &amp; entertainment. denying it's a currency just shows your lack of knowledge &amp; intelligence.
this happened not even a month ago.

[few months ago](
[4 months ago.](


[few DAYS ago lul.](


Kill the white farmers sings politicians, white farmers are getting killed. trying to deny its governmental approved?


Denying it's existence?  oppressing a minority for an overwhelming majority.. take your hat off to eskom, SAA, ugu ect ect.. that's what happens when those not qualified run something. ANC is another great example lul. BEE/BBEEE/AA is working as intended i guess?

Iv asked myself that a few times, and came to the conclusion there needs to be a reason for drastic change, i'v never had alot so right now i'm incredibly happy being able to buy new games as they come out, have a huge tv, know i can eat every night &amp; my car will always have full gas.

lol. everything is "good" for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:56:59
I moved to the UK a few months ago from a "shithole" country, and i can tell you it's the most frustrating and difficult thing to set up a bank account here. it was infuriating to the point i had to use Revolut to find a place to rent &amp; set everything up. If a bank can make it easier to open an account then im sure many people would flock to it. I have hundreds of bitcoins that i wanted to sell which would of been great business for any bank, but after the interrogations, restrictions &amp; amount of things i needed to make a simple savings account i was very much put off.
