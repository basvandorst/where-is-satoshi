Well, you're right. "American" is not a race. So "racist" doesn't apply.
So, you stand by your generalzations or do you also claim that Navajo are drunkards, Mexicans are lazy, Italians stink, Germans are mean, etc, etc. ect.....

Well, there's this...

After having been in the IT biz for - damn - going on 2 decades now - I'd *NEVER* trust anything important to just a USB key. 
I've seen way too many just up and die. Policy here is USB drives are used for convenience - not storage. NOTHING goes on a key that doesn't also exist someplace else &lt;not a key&gt;.

Never trust a USB stick as your sole media. I've seen way too many fail. Policy in our shop - nothing goes on a USB stick that isn't also stored somewhere else. USB sticks are for transfer and convenience, not storage.

Never said I had *the* answer, I just now what I don't trust.
Paper does have a few charms.

Ah, the new non-color based racism reveals itself.
Wondered how long that'd take.

Well, that will prevent loosing it - but it sure doesn't prevent it's failure. In fact, it may well encourage it.

Yup, about what I expected. Seems the concept is outside your scope. Far be it from me to try and educate you.
Besides, I though you were leaving?

Sorry, thought you could read your own posts. To make it easier I'll enumerate from your previous post:
* permanent stupor between debts
* alcoholism
* sugar high
* brain addled public schooling
* statist cult
You wrote that as generalizations - thought you'd be able to read it as well.
 It seems comprehension is the problem. Watch the door on the way out.
