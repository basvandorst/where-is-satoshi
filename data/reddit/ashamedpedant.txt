A government doesn't have to spend their currency, they can auction them off like pollution credits for some other currency. Ever been to an arcade?
There are and have been many examples of countries where the de jure and de facto currencies are different, yet the legal currency still retains some value.

... There are a number of cap and trade systems already functioning today (not just for co2) with credits that only have value because governments demand them. I don't care for MMT and don't give a damn if you do. But I would hope you understand that if a government controls supply of X, and contributes to demand of X, than they can give X a nonzero price.

In fact I wouldn't be surprised if a substantial fraction of BCH's volume were phony transactions. My only point was that "shit tons of extra coins" compared to BTC is disingenuous.

BCH supply is 0.6% higher than BTC, about 105,000 coins. Multiply that by the current price in USD and you get about $96 million. coinmarketcap.com puts BCH's 24 hour volume at $4.58 billion. So if miners never sold a single [*edit*: of the extra] mined BCH until today when they dumped it all, that'd account for about 2.1% of the daily volume.
*Edit*: The total BCH mined since the time of the fork is around 295,000 coins.

No it isn't.
