Yeah retire wasn't meant in the truest form in the title, good point
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:32:31
Then I guess I will wait for the stock market to take a turn and invest heavily into it 8 months after the crash, save wisely, pay my dues, climb the corporate ladder, and retire at 50. I don't put more than 10% my household income into crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-14 14:16:40
Ah so many things wrong with what I'd do. First off, if it hits 100k im out. If it goes down to 90k, thats not a drop, im not buying. If it goes up to 400k, then the correction is significantly higher than what I thought it'd be with a 100k ath. Either way I'm fine with 100k. If i missed out i missed out. My debts are paid for. If I see an obvious bottom, ill buy back in. I've been through this before, im not gunna fomo into anything.
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:37:17
Which model is this based off of? I want multiple plans based off of how it goes. If it crushes past 100 then obviously I'm following the wrong model. Edit: it might be the same model but just has a wide range of 100-300k.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:13:22
Either way, Im not financially ruined cause I never invest more than I can lose...soo yay?
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:03:02
To avoid fees basically.
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:49:33
$5000 to $70,000 in a month?? Yes please this sounds real.
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:01:53
Yeah I still dont think I can retire off 1mil. But it would give me a passive form of income to live very well off while im still working. You're right tho.
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:53:16
Thats why I plan on using the stock to flow model to sell high and buy low, accumulating hopefully 2-5 btc the first cycle, and again in the next.

Screw that guy in particular
@_date: 2019-08-14 14:31:49
From what I see, you just accumulate periodically when it's 2.3 and under, and sell periodically when its 2.4 or higher.
@_date: 2019-10-28 16:11:28
Will do
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:15:03
To you as well
@_date: 2019-08-23 13:19:11
If your asking how supply and demand affect Bitcoins pricing even tho the supply is fixed, its because the rate of supply is decreasing while the rate of demand is increasing. When we assume many people are holding their coins and not selling, what we are left with is a limited amount of bitcoin going around and being created. And it's going to get more scarce every halving. I think thats why we have natural bubbles, so we get periods of major sell offs to get more supply in the space. I do have a masters in economics but i very well could be wrong as this is a new asset class and all.
@_date: 2019-08-13 22:25:14
will do, thanks
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:10:10
Yeah I can easily prove that. I get alerts for purchases over $100, on top of suspected fraud, and I have gotten rightfully alerted in the past, but not this time.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:18:36
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:14:38
Obviously I'm going to watch it closer to that and it's not gunna be exact. Someone commented about just thethering any amount that goes over 100k until the drop, but it if goes all the way up to 300k or something, then yeah I missed out. But still worst case scenario my debt is paid off and I can still use that money to save up to retire earlier.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:57:27
Yikes. I hope that a joke. I've never dropped that much on btc at once. I've just been dca'ing 10% since oct. 2017.

Yep. Retiring for me means getting to continue to pursue the sport I love in a semipro setting, or coach it. Not as much money in that as I am making now, but dang that sounds perfect for me.

Thanks, i actually JUST finished reading that before you commented lol
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:58:48
If 50 is the new standard of retirement then maybe i  thinking too small
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:46:41
You're right. I guess in this scenario it would be like the first implementation stages, when it still has volatility. Maybe it wont even be implemented until it is more stable than normal currencies. Good point.
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:11:41
Thats also an option. That would help with the loans and in 5 years will still be a lot of money. Not completely life changing but still.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:20:33
This is typically correct, the stock to flow model takes into account the assets life cycle, so eventually the curve starts to even out and bull runs/bear cycles become less dramatic. Either way generally this is what I see happening.
@_date: 2019-08-19 22:41:13
Please explain to us how Bitcoin is a failed asset....
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:25:15
Nah you didn't read all the way through. I plan to have 2-5 btc by the time it reaches 500k. You probably cant retire off of a million dollars but you sure can live off interest for a long long time if you do it right.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:29:27

The one true answer
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:41:26
Ive been through the previous bubble. I know the percentages to look for and the general timeframe of how long the parabolic run lasts. In 2017 i looked at charts from previous bubbles and found ~2 weeks to be the max time it runs for before crashing. Only had a few hundred in but I sold on Dec. 20th. Then, looking at the lows, I found 3-4k should be the bottom. I bought my heaviest bag on Dec 17th 2018, practically the bottom. I'm good at paying attention.

Ok, i didn't know the last part. Hopefully they can at least stop them from happening again.
@_date: 2019-10-28 16:59:31
Oh boy. how do I even reply to this. Chase never sent me a notice about this. I have been alerted before years ago and I worked with Chase to fix the problem. I know what thats like. This never set of any alarms for chase and I absolutely, 100%, positively, did not order anything from this supplement shop. I don't believe in the supplements they offer, I don't get drunk so I couldn't have purchased this under the influence, I don't even have the site in my search history. I didn't receive any package, i did not receive any purchase confirmation emails from this company, and I did not give my card info to anyone else. They charged for a new order the day I activated my new card. I hadnt even used the internet that day yet before they charged me. They said they can reimburse me again and refuse all future purchases with this company but I need to reorder a new card again which obviously isn't the issue. Also they will most likely reverse the reimbursement again.
But hey, if you want to think I made this story up for 11 upvotes...more power to you I guess.
Edit: Let me add this: I found [other people claiming]( this same company to be guilty of credit card theft. I'm not the only one who has this exact same thing happen.

@_date: 2019-08-29 19:11:39
Full Q and A:  
Stephan Livera: Yeah. Really interesting stuff. The other big obvious question that I’m sure every listener wants to understand here is the question around sample size. Obviously, we’re very early in Bitcoin, it’s only been 10 years, and we’ve only seen two halvings. Do you have any hesitations about the fact that we’ve only seen two halvings? Can we really predict further out based on only a “sample size of 2”?
PlanB: Yeah, good question, and indeed I get it a lot. Maybe one step back, if we go to the model. Coming from this chart, this scatterplot that we just described, I wanted to make a more formal model to see if there is any significant statistical relationship; and since there was a straight-line visual, I thought, “Okay, let’s do a simple linear regression,” and that confirmed what could already be seen with the naked eye, that there was a statistical significant relationship; so F and P values were very, very low, and it had a nice 95% R-squared, so that gives some confidence in the model. Of course, I also added gold and silver in there, which were totally unrelated markets, but they turned out to be right on this model line, and that to me gives some extra confidence in the model.
PlanB: About the halving, and that there is only two halvings, I think that’s a good point, and that’s why I call it a hypothesis; we’re going to see if it’s right in May 2020, or actually after May 2020 halving. It can be wrong. On the other hand, if we look at the halvings, I use 111 data points, so not only two data points, and the stock-to-flow also rises in between the halvings, so not only at the halvings, then it makes a big jump, but it also rises in between the halvings. For example, if we take the first four years before there was even a halving, so the period until November 2012, Bitcoin stock-to-flow increased in that period from below 1 to 3-4ish around the halving; and if I would have made that model, the linear regression, only in the first four years, it would have been exactly the same. So, I could have predicted the next halving value and the second halving value with only the first four years of data, and that gives me some confidence in the model.
 PlanB: Also, if you look at this period between the first and the second halving, 2012-2016, it starts in the bottom left and it ends in the top right, and that’s true for the first four years, the second four years, and the current period we are in. So, I think it’s not only the two halvings and that we only have two data points, but I agree that a third and even a fourth halving would add credibility to the model.

Eh, speaking of "probability", the model i follow has accurately predicted the price of bitcoin in the month of October since 2014 to the 95th percentile. So there's something im going off of at least.
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:48:15
The whole point of the original post was to show that you don't even get to decide if it's fraud or not. Your bank does. I know for a fact this is a illegitimate charge, my bank doesn't believe me, therefore the charge stays when they very well could have helped me right then and there, but instead I had to bend over backwards for 48 hours to find a plan C solution that might not work. It's the fact that I have no say in what I supposedly did or did not buy.
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:47:43

What are the tax implications of this?
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:54:09
It means i am going to put that 100k into multiple quality stable coins, not necessarily Tether. So that my 100k stays 100k while btc drops below that mark.

Yeah but Dave usually talks about *high interest* debt like car or credit card, not mortgages (since mine is super low). 1&amp;2 are a check otherwise I wouldn't be in this space.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:21:43
I put it in quotes because its become a phrase, I do not plan to put everything in tether.
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:44:39
Im not new. I know how quickly things move. I start selling at 75k slowly (or quickly) up to 100k. The whole parabolic process last around 2 weeks. Not my first rodeo.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:17:32
Which is why I plan for a shorter range. Expect 100k with 20k bottom, prepare for 300k with 10k bottom. Less realistic but im still prepared.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:27:20
Ive thought about this. My solution is to break the 100k between multiple stable coins across multiple exchanges. It will only be on there for 8 months max so if one were to get hacked, Id still have 80% somewhere else. Also, screw tether. I just meant that as a phrase.
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:15:00
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:39:15
absolutely. honestly with or without crypto ill get there eventually
@_date: 2019-08-23 23:44:40
By halving: 20k, by 2021 ath: 100k, 2022 low, 30k, 2024 ath: 500k. All conservative estimates.
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:04:00
Nah cause im not selling all at once if it shoots through 100k. Probably 5 20% increments.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:18:51
Right. But generally speaking if I'm off and sell at 100k, the bottom is still gunna be lower than 100k...and if not, then hey I have 100k to pay off my debt and can get back in with the money im saving.
@_date: 2019-10-28 16:11:12
That's what they keep asking me. I absolutely would not have signed up for anything. Also the purchases are at random times of the month. 13th, 22nd, and 27th.

Am I an idiot for taking my stock market profits from the past year and putting it into bitcoin? Cause thats exactly what I did.
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:49:29
By -5x I mean divided by 5. So 100k/5 being 20k. Typically this has been the case with the ath to subsequent bottom.

@_date: 2019-08-27 13:48:54
So because it was higher than expectations last time, it will be lower this time? And now that we have an accurate model for bitcoin that takes into account the maturity of the market, it will now break that because...it doesn't do what is expected?

Every 4ish years the reward for mining bitcoin gets cut in half. This creates a sudden drop in rate of supply and thus an increase of demand over the following 8-12 months. This creates the bubbles bitcoin is famous for.

That more than covers my expenses for the year. I have a wife who never wants to retire so there is another income there. Also I will be working but it will be something I love doing for less probably. So we will have around 60k a year after taxes and expenses, which is considered well off.

I wish i had two by then. Maybe I'll only implement this plan with half a btc to minimize risk

In the future we replace a . with a space.

I mean, they won't let US citizens sign up or trade after September, so thats kind of shutting down access in some ways. But yeah it's going to be a good thing overall.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:05:51
I still have hopes of buying more in the 7-8k range, but I really do feel like if it hits 10k, it's not going back under that (maybe in the short term but not once the media gets the word out). I've heard so many people say they'll buy at 10k. I guess it's psychological at that point. People figure 50% gains to ath is much more realistic than when we were telling them to buy at 4k (250% gains).

I just wish I wasn't broke the first time around. I felt so cool turning $50 into 100. Now I have big boy money.

Is there a way to "tether up" on Coinbase? I have my btc there right now but I don't have a quick exit strategy. Do I have to transfer it to ethereum then USD Coin or what?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:00:24
I guess thats the same taxation wise anyway. Good point.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:17:57
Thats ok i guess. I've been DCAing since 2017, not gunna stop now.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:40:35
This hits hard
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:45:09
Yeah ill take it. Usually I assume if you mention bitcoin going any direction but up 100% of the time you get downvoted here. Oh well, at least I'm not invested in Bcash.
@_date: 2019-06-19 18:44:13
As a Christian I say bitcoin is not correlated to atheism. Or anything for that matter.
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:26:07
Just found out they are the same person :(
@_date: 2019-04-29 23:53:29
I think people are starting to catch on to it tho. If you look on /cc the general feeling towards ETH is pretty negative lately.
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:12:03
I guess in the grand scheme of where Btc is heading, this will look like a sideways year
@_date: 2019-12-23 02:28:54
It's almost scary how predictable they are
@_date: 2019-04-13 03:57:07
Those are rookie numbers. You gotta get those numbers up.
In all seriousness tho welcome to the club
@_date: 2019-04-09 13:16:38
Same. Went all in with them.

Now do the Mr Krabs trick and get your coins back. Free money.

Dad jokingly told me the other day that he's glad he didn't listen to me when I advised him to buy some Bitcoin. I said, "Dad, I told you to buy last Christmas when it was under 4k. If you would have bought then you'd be up 200% at least". Then the usual, "Yeah well it's too expensive anyways, if I'm buying I want a complete coin". Keep waiting padre, keep waiting.
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:03:17
Looking at my hourly chart, I can see these people sold because money.
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:31:58
Hey I posted that there too!
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:40:12
Yep, following this model till 2024. Then i agree it may break.
@_date: 2019-09-08 12:27:59
These past couple weeks this sub has seen some great articles come through that I send to all my friends new to crypto. Good stuff.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:11:21
Anyone notice a pattern here? It's like a mini 2017 bubble. The rise, the bounces, the stagnation, then the fall.
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:53:37
According to my TA this dump is caused by people selling their Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-05 01:20:00
Good Jack.

I wish I had an anonymous friend that would say "What Up, O?" every time I made a comment...
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:47:30
Very interesting. Even more of a reason to hodl now.

He also passed on Ring, which was acquired by Amazon for 1Billion

Lol acting like it's not going to bubble up again...thats how we make our money, guy.
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:06:03
This man singlehandedly started this little run. Lol
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:45:05
Same. I think either way I'm cashing out at 200k. I don't want to get greedy and have it crash on me overnight. If all else fails...hodl till it hits 1 million lol

It may or may not have a decimal next to one of those digits.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:59:04
My holdings reflect the last 3 digits of pi
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:47:02
That implies a quick build up after the halving. Most see this coming late 2021/early 2022. I agree with the price range tho.

So if bitcoin ever overtakes gold, they'll probably have like 100 billion USD.

@_date: 2019-05-12 13:54:40
How did you get the crypto in the first place? Maybe I misread.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:35:46
Goku Black (evil), Majin Vegeta (evil), good Goku, and I'm pretty sure if he kept moving it, it would show good Vegeta cause I saw one of these irl
@_date: 2019-05-21 18:17:54
Hahahahahahaha IDIOTS
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:14:38
How many more times do you think the halving is going to affect Bitcoins price, or if you don't think it has an affect, how many more bubbles will Bitcoin experience before becoming more stable.
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:50:35
Correct, if btc is to be digital gold and is publicly recognized as such, its price will rise. You kept saying "as a last resort", and thats exactly what gold is during recessions.
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:34:11
I mean it's possible, im just saying even tho Bitcoin is better than gold, it needs quite a large amount of adoption to get to that level. Either that or a massive speculative bubble.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:45:07
I was literally just thinking this. Probably Satoshis and Sats for short? Idk

You're trying too hard. This isn't fun anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:19:13
Yeah but 500k means it will have the same market cap as gold, which I think we'll get there someday but not within this next run.

If you watch Shark Tank you'll know Kevin always misses out on the biggest opportunities. He basically needs -80% risk to invest in something.

Solution: she gives the money to you to buy it for her. You put it on a cold wallet and give it back to her.

Sure he's had big wins, but out of the 6 sharks, he’s 2nd to last in spending, just in front of Barbara. he’s accounted for just 5.4 mil of the 63 mil that has been offered on the show. For reference, Cuban and Robert contributed ~16-18 mil each. [source](
