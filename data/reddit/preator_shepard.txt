I know all about medical bills in the states, my left leg is worth $50,000 from the surgery and hospital stay.
currently $800 is a lot of money and there is more leaving all the time. it would not be so bad except i am currently not able to do my second job which offset all my bills.

Its still climbing almost 19000 CAD

Well heres the thing i am not quite sure.
I copied my wallet off a floppy backup and an older cd backup.
Both had the same hash. Now its possible a few bits flipped as both types of media are very old.
Floppy was old used from a company
Cd was only 650mb
No issue copying data off. So digital corruption?

I would not know where to even start. How would you do this safely?

Im looking to see if i have the hash but i do not know believe so. I have an issue where my encryption key got damaged and that took out a lot of things. This included  a backup of my bit coin wallet.
The floppy and cd was before the encryption issue.
Ill rerun the hash check and see if i can select bit by bit checked.
I dont know the version of software as it has been so many years.

19,900 CAD right now keeps bouncing back and forth
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:41:17
Sorry i think i typed the above statement a bit weird.
The copy on both floppy and cd were before i used encryption on my pc they are completely free of it.
I had the original wallet still on my pc with a copy of the hash and that was all killed.
I may have a backup of the has but i am digging through old hard drives and floppys but is not looking good.

Well once it reaches $20,000 CAD which it keeps bouncing between, I am selling most of my bit coin and pulling out my $2000 investment and $1000 profit. the rest I will keep in until retirement time or the leftover is worth $20,000.
I am worried about the ETF on Monday and i need some cash for some health problems.
I want to thank bitcoin for helping me out where this would not have been possible.
I am trying to recover my original wallet with 15BTC in with some help but i think it is dead.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:01:06
I'm supper depressed. My wallet which I found in old backups is corrupted.
15 BTC over $200,000 CAD gone.
Just depressed as I could have used that money for covering some medical bills and setting myself up a retirement fund.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:02:29
No i did not even know about that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:25:00
I was in a car accident involved on city property so i am fighting with the city to cover, meds, reports etc.
Currently out $800 and it is climbing. Which is over 4 months of savings for me. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:51:30
had it backed up to both a floppy and cd, both are unreadable. :( tried ISo buster etc but the files have unreadable bits.
even checked with data recover services, and they said they could not pull it 100%
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:44:01
Here I am crying as i found my old wallet with 15 BTC in it and its corrupt.
I could have been rich. :(
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:53:02
Issue is I know the password, and had it written down. Problem is the data in the wallet.DAT is corrupted
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:52:57
As I am Canadian 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:54:10
Ah man, that's brutal. you can keep watching it go up, but do nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:53:21
I currently have been holding $500 in it and made $70.
Keep buying a bit every month that's my strategy.

my wallet was from back in the day before these exchanges. Everyone ran the BTC client and the wallet was where the bitcoins were held on your computer.
