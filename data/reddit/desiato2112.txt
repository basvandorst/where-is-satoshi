Yes they did. The only like-kind exchanges they allowed tax-free are real estate.
I wonder why?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:20:09
Nah, I disagree. Possessing an asset that fluctuates in value means you own the potential for growth. You have exchanged a relativy stable (in the short term) commodity (fiat currency) for something with volatility. There's no loss there, other than the loss of ability to spend that cash elsewhere, a situation you would also be in if your btc was in the green.

Well said.

That would be funny if the guy wasn't serious

LOL the 32" flatsceen we've used for the past 5 years is seeming too small for them to play games on anymore...
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:12:42
Because the SEC hands those out to anyone who wants one. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:16:18
I hear they almost chose "proofread." ��

You haven't lost a cent until you sell!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:39:35
Good point, Wallyjo3. With less to lose, millennials are willing to risk more. I think it will serve you well in btc.

Bubbles can pull back significantly and then reach new highs. Look at the dot com bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:23:59
Because they want to lock in some profits now. 
Sure, they will be responsible for taxes next April instead of April 2019, but a lot of things can happen in that time frame.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:42:54
If they were manipulating the bitcoin cash thing, they deserve to get slagged. But as far as a platform for buying and sellng btc, eth, and ltc, I can't really complain. Gdax is a decent interface. It could be better, but it ain't bad. I've traded on much worse with stocks and index futures over the past 15 years. They've had some lags during high volume, but scaling up is easier said than done. I'm sure they could have done it better than they have, but overall I'm not too bummed with CB.

I'm buying a small chunk each time it drops another $1k. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:19:08
You got that right. Glad I had some in the tank to repurchase during this pullback. I hope everyone is taking advantage now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:51
And in other news, water is wet.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:21:23
The easiest way is via Coinbase and your bank account or credit card. There are drawbacks, of course, but it's probably the fastest and most straightforward.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:14:32
It's not advice, just a reminder of fact.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:37:15
I'm not a millionaire, or even close. I'm buying smaller amounts - just making 45 degree angle buys right now as it pulls back.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:42:12
One need not show bitcoin is a currency in order to prove money laundering. Money is laundered all the time via real property - cars, homes, artwork, etc. The USG makes cases against these kinds of laundering activities all the time. ML via bitcoin would fall in the same arena.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:51:40
LOL I'm sure I didn't say anything like that. But all regulation isn't bad. We WANT some regulation to protect crypto customers from unscrupulous exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:02:59
It was the stylus and the integrated software that did it. I left iphone a few years ago and got a Note 4 and loved the screenwriting ability, so they had me hooked. Still hate the curved display.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:26:46
Blockchain will certainly have a big place in our future. But as soon as the USG feels threatened by whatever crypto rises to the top as a payment method, they will regulate the shit out of it or make it illegal. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:39
I read the post. I'm agreeing with you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:38:19
Relax, Donnie, these men are cowards.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:13:55
True. But patience can (but won't always) turn the loss into a gain.

Bought the dip this morning at $12.8k. Digging it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:31:50
This. A tax attorney will tell you the same thing. The IRS only wants to make sure you properly calculate the basis (and thus the capital gain), and then pay the proper tax.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:42:48
Buy the dip, friends.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:03:54
It's one of a hundred reasons I hate the edge display. Such a terrible design - functionally screwed and cases barely protect the screen. But there was no other option if you wanted a Note 8, which I did, so...

I'd ask John McAfee 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:10:36
No. The entire cause of the housing market crash was due to the relaxing/elimination of lender regulations. Stated income loans became the norm. Unregulated derivatives sold to insure sub-prime mortgages blew up with no money to pay them. Sure, the WS banks packaged terrible mortgage products, but it was the fact that no regulations existed to insure AIG and similar CDS writers maintained some cash on hand to pay off those insurance policies that forced the crash and the massive bailout.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:15:30
LOL that's the damn truth!
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:35:46
This. Sexy headlines get clicks. They might tell the rest of the story in the article (might), but they know how short our attention spans are, so...
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:07:33
Well, it certainly includes the anarchists, but I think most of the fans of cryptos also are fans of the privacy that accompanies it. I don't think the majority are trying to engage in illegal activity, but this lack of transparency certainly does make criminal behavior easier. It also makes avoiding taxes easier, and that's something governments won't abide.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:39:23
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:10
I've been buying on their exchange all evening. There have been some hiccups, but nothing major.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:29:36
Very good points. It all certainly comes down to everyone's current capital gain situation. In the scenario you outline, selling now could be wise, assuming the turnaround doesn't happen before January 1st.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:22:12
LOL I got burned on Enron for real. It was only $3k, but I still remember it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:57
I think everyone takes profits right before Christmas so they can buy the GI Joe with the Kung Fu grip for their kids. Gotta have a Merry Christmas.
I think after next week, we will see new highs. Not sure how long it will take to get there, but I'm a bull long term.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:29:40
Umm, this is money laundering. You're advising him to commit a crime in order to follow the law.

Even more surprising  - anyone is still using YikYak 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:39:33
It's certainly possible, and I hope that you are correct. The issue right now is that so many of those that support cryptocurrencies are in favor of it for the exact reasons major banks and governments would oppose it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:31:55
Good on ya. Let's ride this for all it's worth.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:11:06
Exactly. Everything is a bubble. Always. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:08:48
Make no mistake - governments will not allow their own currencies to go down without a fight. The US Gov't has the most to lose, as the Dollar's status as the world reserve currency gives the gov't tremendous power. There is no way they will give that up. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:22:50
No worries - I'm still holding onto some BTC for the big move up, the lambo, house, and college fund money.
