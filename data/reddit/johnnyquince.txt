Not anymore, BRK dumped it all in August after buying it during the heat of the recession. Made a nice profit but still held a little longer than they should have.

You can't buy bitcoin in ~~an~~ most IRAs. The only current vehicle for owning bitcoin in a traditional IRA is Grayscales Bitcoin Investment Trust (Symbol: GBTC) and it has wildly diverted from the price of the underlying assets recently. In the last month bitcoin has increased 57% while the price of GBTC has increased only 21%. (And GBTC is still trading at significant premium to the bitcoins it owns.)
It usually varies between 25%-70% premium on the price of the underlying BTC/BCH.

The tax problems are definitely a big part of mass acceptance.
I was under the impression you only need to pay taxes if you first sold the coins for cash and used cash to pay the bills. Upon further research it does appear that you must pay capital gains on any transaction done with it.

Definitely not cool.

And this is exactly why bitcoin won't work.

Berkshire Hathaway (Class A) makes $13,263 profit per share putting the P/E at 21.16 which is above the S&amp;P 500 historical average of 15.7 but below the current S&amp;P 500 average of 25.7.
Seems to be valued relatively fairly.
Bitcoin could be the future thus I would defer my beliefs on its valuation to the market which certainly knows more than I. The rate of appreciation is staggering but not necessarily outpacing the innovation that could soon follow.

Those are some fair points but then you need to sell some BTC once the cc APR resets to the normal 17-25%. That may be a new ATH or it may be a dip.
Either way, you never want to be in a position where you have to sell any investment. You should sell when you want to sell.

$800/month interest * 12 months/year * 15 years till 10x = $144,000 in interest. Now your 5x BTC are worth $350,000 - $144,000 interest - $35,000 principal = $171,000 profit. So bitcoin went up 10x but in the end you only multiplied your invested amount by 4.8. The interest is just too high - it eats most of your gains.
Even so, if you only pay the minimum then your balance will actually compound and grow to way more than that over time - and if you actually COULD pay the interest every month, why would you have maxed your credit cards in the first place versus investing your own money for free?
We can imagine even crazier scenarios. Bitcoin goes up 100x in the next 15 years and you don't make any payments until you cash out your position because you don't actually have any spare money. Then your 5 BTC are worth about $3.5M and the balance on your credit card is $995,000 still giving you about $2.5M profit over 15 years or about 71x the initial investment while also eliminating your ability to ever get financing for anything again. Not to mention that fiat is inflationary so that $2.5M in 2032 dollars is worth far less than $2.5M today and housing prices are almost guaranteed to increase substantially over that time.
Not to mention, "the only thing to lose is credit score" - which actually means the ability to ever buy a house, a new car or send your kids to college.
It just doesn't make any sort of financial sense for &gt; 99.999% of people.

Fair enough, you are correct about that.
However, only ~18% of Americans even have an IRA to begin with and the vast majority of them are not self directed.
So for most people, it is true that they cannot buy bitcoin in their IRA.

AFAIK stocks and houses have never lost &gt; 84% of their value in a single bear market like BTC did from Nov '13 to Jan '15.
Stock market indices will always go up in the long term, that is basically guaranteed. Real estate will probably go up in the long term, that is a very good bet. BTC may go up in the long term but it is definitely much riskier than the other two.
At least if your house loses value you can still live in it. Student loans are for acquiring an education and paying them off with your income - not for speculating on fringe commodities.

Not here to perpetuate any "conspiracy theories" or the like.
BUT the Rothschild and Schroder banking families do own very large stakes in the magazine. So its not exactly surprising that they do not embrace technology that is attempting to disrupt some of their businesses.

Yes obviously APR is annual percentage rate and 25% is very high and really hurts your gains (and probably credit score). There are much cheaper ways to get credit if you have a good score plus income and/or some assets.
You could make money that way but its very risky and a 6 month dip would probably kill most people paying $800/month interest on their 5 BTC that lost value.

No. When everyone is saying to buy at ATH it is evidence that a correction will be coming.
If BTC goes up another 50% before correcting by 50% it would be cheaper to get in after the correction than now. Traders tend to test different support and resistance levels that include past ATH's and past dips.
It will almost certainly dip below this price point again, but the question of when and for how long is up in the air.
But as they say in r/investing (about stocks not bitcoin, but it can apply to bitcoin) **time in the market is more important than timing the market**. Get in whenever you can and hold forever if you really believe in an investment for the long term. 
However, as I said before, there are people trading BTC all of the time looking for good technical entry and exit points to maximize profits. This almost ensures that lower price levels will be tested at some point in time.

It is some 'boomer junk' but that can be easily divested and reinvested into 'millennial junk' when the time comes. 
Boomers are spending more than ever - they're just retiring now not yet dying off en masse - and millennials aren't spending that much.
Though Warren Buffett is no spring chicken himself, the majority of BRK's holdings are massive proven companies that, at the moment, there is still quite a lot of demand for.

I do. I guess this disconnect probably has to do with our definitions of 'rich' and 'mindless wage slaves.'
I do know some people who will fit into my definitions of these groups but it's not the majority.
But I also know many people on both sides of the aisle from many different walks of life who are neither rich nor mindless wage slaves by my definitions. For the most part they do pretty well and are moderately happy with their careers - everyone is underpaid unless they work for themselves - and tend to be happy with their lives in general for that matter.

I edited my post because obviously EVERYONE doesn't agree on anything - certainly not on new technology such as this. But some people on this sub have been saying such things, that is my point.
I don't include selling it for cash because that's like selling USD for EUR or CAD or gold. It's more like currency/commodity trading (which is fine) than it is like purchasing goods or services.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:35:29
Wow that's awesome that you can and do use it when paying for a variety of different goods and services. Bravo!
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:14:05
Please enlighten me on why currencies shouldn't be exchanged for goods and services.

That's a very cynical opinion of society lol. It isn't that bad yet but it seems to be getting worse.

You sold at a ATH - nice! Don't look back and pretend that even if you held through that one that you wouldn't have sold at $1,000 and paid off your loans + extra cash. Or at $2,000. Or again at $4,000.
You made the responsible call. If you truly believed bitcoin was "going to the moon" you would have then used the money that you saved on student loan payments every month and bought more and more bitcoin. You did keep buying bitcoin every month with your interest free cash right?
