I only go with the highest trusted btc guys always smooth trades and I won't do bank or credit cards just prepaid debits. Netspend or my vanilla move $ trades.

Yes :( but he delved in some pretty heavy fent analogues, which I NVR did try. He OD once last yr &amp; I saved him hoping that was his wake up call but he said he wasn't ready to change, I accepted that, it happend a second time I woke up to him gone, still a battle today missing him. But I nvr invested in what he did, he showed me other ways to make $. (Also, I don't get high on supply.) So, I'd hardly call those DNM stuff goodies.

Yes!! Thank you, well said love how you explained this to me, glad this post wasn't bashed.. MG started freezing my $ and would ask me hella ?s before I could even get my $ refunded smfh which is why I sought out a different way. As dealing with MG agents who barely speak English, usually ended with me telling them off.. Prepaid card to card seems easiest an is less of a fee. Too bad the nearest Btc ATM is 300mi. away from me.
