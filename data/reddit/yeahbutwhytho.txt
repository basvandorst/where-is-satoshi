You are the exact type of person everyone should picture as the majority of  'bitcoin hodlers'
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:55:10
Looks like its an automatic message for everyone, some funny business going on
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:43:10
I hope they sell before that donation is worth $20,000
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:25:36
Although it not better, in fact - its much much worse.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:53:01
That sucks
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:50:21
I bet you won't even buy you lil bitch
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:04:30
Not if they lie and say they have enough USD to back up the tether they're printing
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:49:03
You lost your fiat mannn
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:47:50
Lol are you guys celebrating the race to the bottom?
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:04:39
Nah, its that you're clueless
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:15:48
People lose money, they get upset
People make money, they're suddenly happy
Wtf people calm down
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:57:20
That's exactly how OP's title sounded
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:50:39
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:03:48
No basically someone trys to sell their bitcoin for a dollar more than the other people and if someone buys that it becomes the new price that shows.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:12:32
So hype caused the price rises? Sounds exactly like Tulips
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:43
"The price drop has nothing to do with anything."
Neither does the price rises, the gainz aren't based off anything 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:51:18
People can't sell if you don't let them
@_date: 2018-08-05 06:49:02
Happy Birthday, I did the searching for you
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:02:48
Are you in 1800's Rome? Use the internet you retard
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:14:08
If no one buys it at 100k then it'll just drop down to the next price people will pay
The last price sold at is new price. Do you even understand basic economics
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:08:49
1 bitcoin is worth 1 bitcoin until you sell
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:51:58
Buy high sell low
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:44:09
Who is going to buy everyones bitcoin for 400,000 each, is there enough money in the world
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:35:59
Not much has changed, you still can't buy anything with Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:59:00
Curious, how much do you pay in fees and currency conversion if you transfer $100 worth of bitcoins to someone in the Philippines, then had to convert it to Peso?
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:50:32
When that comes why would someone holding heaps bitcoins sell for dirty fiat?
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:39:31
So you're saying the worlds current fiat millionaires and billionaires will happily make themselves poorer by transferring their wealth to early adopters of bitcoin. Sounds cool
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:45:02
Its below support
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:37:41
The good amount
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:25:11
You should probably sell then, bitcoin is going to $12.99
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:17:10
Are you implying you're smart because your bitgamble based on nothing dropped 50% 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:31:43

@_date: 2017-10-14 06:07:44
Yes because you're making money off people who are dumb enough to pay more for it than you are, when essentially its worth less than nothing* - thats the point he's trying to make
If Bitcoin is so valuable you shouldn't ever sell it for that disgusting 'fiat' trash, just live off bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:07:11
Kids are dumb and gullible, they'll exactly know the concept of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:24:27
Yes because that'll ever happen
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:21:39
Currency of the future
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:07:14
You should just spend Bitcoin, you don't need fiat
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:34:37
I tried to edit comment but clicked delete by accident, what I said was I'm not missing it, I do get it - the value is whatever people will buy it for but the part you're missing that its essentially a ponzi scheme.
But not even that, as we need a new definition. Bitcoin works on the greater fool theory
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:33:13
Money (dollars whatever) replaces the value of something. A banana is worth the idea of $1USD (example)
Bitcoins however in this case replaces the value of Money. 1 bitcoin is worth $1600. So bitcoins are worth less than nothing
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:24:43
All the individual words typed in this thread exist too, perhaps we should start selling that too? If we get enough people to believe it, it could be worth $10000USD
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:52:29
Gold exists
Also you can't buy gold with bitcoin, unless you find a sucker
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:07:20
One day it may be worth $2000, but the sucker buying it will need to sell for more and so on. It's not a real thing, its not a currency
It's a game of hot potato haha
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:52:14
Read the second part again and come back to me, ponzi scheme in essence as we don't have a definition for something like this. I found Greater Fool Theory which is spot on
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:35:49
Actually none of that is what I think, you don't understand why I called it a ponzi scheme. Its because it has no real world value as a currency and never will
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:28:16
If your idea for bitcoin is to completely replace paper/digital currency then what should happen is every dollar everyone has ever owned should be converted 1:1 with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:10:36
711 then acts as said sucker, until they sell the bitcoin to another sucker. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:08:10
Well its 'censorship resistant', but for it to be a 'payment' I'd need to be able to buy bananas with it. Read what I wrote, I'll quote it. "the whole reason why Bitcoins are worth $1600 today is because of the thought that its an actual currency, but it's quite certain now that we will never be able to go into a store and buy anything with it"
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:11:28
lol wtf, ofcourse it is - any world currency is. Zimbabwe dollars too
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:50:24
Its not though :( but its at the point where if I say I can actually see, feel and hang up art, its a real thing then you will say if you can't see something does it mean its worthless, is money in the bank worthless too then I will say no because I can buy things with money whereas I can only trade my bitcoins for money that only a sucker will accept
I shouldn't even say its monopoly money, I can't even explain how nothing it is
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:36:30
..I can buy things with money
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:16:44
I feel like no one has actually read what I wrote. If I sent a guy from Iran 1 bitcoin worth $1600, would he not essentially be receiving a piece of censorship resistant paper that reads 'worth whatever you can sell for'. Now if he's hungry, he'll now need to find a sucker to buy that piece of paper, then that guy will need to buy that from him and the cycle goes on..
If its not a currency its nothing. Holy crap it actually reads like a ponzi scheme..
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:09:31
Amazon is a sucker until they sell the bitcoin. (to do this they'll need to find another sucker)
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:00:23
The bitcoins will then be traded to whatever some sucker will think its worth, and then they will trade to whatever some other sucker is worth, then...
Do you accept 10000 Linden dollars?
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:37:24
Are you comparing bitcoins to art? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:36:28
Sorry, I just assumed people weren't reading it as I thought my original post kind of answered all this.
Well he's a sucker until he sells the bitcoin for profit. To do this you have to find a bigger sucker I would think
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:23:40
Dumb to bring that up, since it doesn't disprove anything I wrote about bitcoins - not even relatable as I can buy bananas with money. 
Very confused at this whole point. Banks are stealing real world currency. So bitcoins should steal real world currency too?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:32:45
This was the original idea for bitcoin, but its not a currency and won't be
I actually found out about bitcoins in a 4chan thread when it was $1.20, I understand I could have been rich selling it for whatever imaginary assigned value it has. I could be a guy with 40000 bitcoins, I could have been the guy that sold bitcoins and live in a mansion now, i could have been the guy in the future that put my life saving in bitcoin at $3000 each and lost it all - doesn't prove anything I wrote as wrong, its truth.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:33:57
All the individual words typed in this thread exist too, perhaps we should start selling that too? If we get enough people to believe it, it could be worth $10000USD
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:04:53
What? I earn interest on the savings in my bank. I also have a no fee transaction account where if I want to buy bananas I can, instantly.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:55:12
Real life
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:03:18
You are correct but that's not the point im sharing, its exactly why its monopoly money in a way, anything has the value of whatever people will pay, I wrote this above. Issue is when I invest in stocks I'm investing on the idea that a business will do well, but when i invest in Bitcoin I'm investing on the idea that someone else will think its worth anything at all. I'm investing on suckers.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:54:18
Great, but now back to the real world where I can't do anything with bitcoins, its a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:18:27
When you say supply/demand.. what will bitcoin be able to do that normal USD on a bank card wouldn't be able to that would drive demand up that high?
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:05:40
Will be it be bigger than the internet only if the bitcoin-cult convinces enough people that it will be 'bigger than the internet' or will it be bigger whether anyone likes it or not?
Very interesting seeing how easy it is taking out my visa card and buying a banana is compared to buying anything with a bitcoin.. also doesn't bitcoin just give power to the miners in china? I feel like this was exciting stuff in 2014, but now the philosophy is dead
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:06:06
Yes I did
Scarcity sure, gold is rarer than copper so its worth more. Gold exists
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:45:36
At one point do you see bitcoin reaching past $10,000 for any reason other then the 'Greater fool theory' playing part
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:25:35
Strawman argument if I have ever seen one
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:16:49
Terrible business choice
Oh looks like we made $2000 in sales today.. oh shit looks like we made only $1500 now.. oh back up to $2000! Never mind we are now broke
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:23:59
