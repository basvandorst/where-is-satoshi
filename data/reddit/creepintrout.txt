Why even do that when "something is free" it's really not.  Look at facebook it's "free" except the fact that it's gathering your data and targeting you for ads and such.  
Even someone who never uses the internet would look at this page and say "this is a scam"
So I'm guessing has something do to with the scam, or is just a complete moron.

I went to buy $260 worth of bitcoin and it would have sent me with $253 worth
I checked two different exchange sites on the rates.  So I don't understand what was going on. 
Try it yourself on coinbase and let me know if you get similar results or if I'm just too green to know.

I wanted to buy bitcoin earlier today and they would have shorted me $8 if I didn't know a thing about the exchange rates.  I am BRAND NEW to bitcoin and I'm thinking coinbase is capitalizing on new users who don't understand the exchage rate.  
So I doubt I'll buy from them, where can I buy bitcoin if I don't use coinbase?

So where is the best place to buy bitcoin without paying too huge of a fee?  
So far coinbase seems the most legit but a lot of people have reviews stating fraud.  I'd go to buylocalbitcoins (or whatever) but I would only use paypal abd the prices are jacked way up to like $50+ beyond the exchange rate.

Seems fishy, a guy comes in fresh and first thing he wants to post is a way others can "make money"
Reaks of a scam to me.  Btw this is a throwaway, downvote away.

I'm in the US.  I thought circle was an app?  Anyway if you've got a link to circle I'll check that out but then most likely order through coinbase.
