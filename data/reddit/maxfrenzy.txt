It's Ember Smoke Shop in Logan Square. 
2827 W. Belden Ave. 60647
Edit: I suppose I should make a post in the appropriate merchant sections on reddit, but for those interested here, I'd be happy to ship products as well. Unfortunately the website isn't a good indicator of what is available. I setup the website as an e-commerce style cart, but I don't keep enough back stock to do something like that (i.e. glass pieces are usually 1 of a kind) and as a result, only have a few items posted up there with mostly out of date pricing.  Eventually we'll be changing it to a blog style where we do video/written reviews on products and discuss upcoming releases.  I think it will be far more useful in that way.

Dugouts are all wood actually. They come with the metal cigarette style bat, however we do have them available in quartz glass as well. I think selection is fairly limited at the moment. On next order we'll be restocking the dugouts. Usually we have an array of teak, rosewood, bacote, cocobola, oak, and other hardwoods. Most are twist style tops, though we have some lift and locks.  There are also some hardhats available now (wooden box with metal lid). Thanks for the interest. It's a small shop that does a little bit of everything.

In this case he's more of knowledgeable accessory. E.G. You rent boats out for a living but know that everyone is using them to haul coke to someone else and there is a very obvious connection that you are aware of the criminal activity. You didn't actually DO it...just facilitated it. I suppose that's really just semantics in this case.

The claim that it will go up or bottom out? Both camps have their speculations by as for it rising in value, well..it would be a combination of supply, demand, more wide spread adoption and the industry and infrastructure to support it. More applications, tools, resources built from the framework and validation from the well known "economists". I suppose is how I'd answer that.  It dropping like a rock, well...loss of interest, technological barriers to entry, any major exploits that involve the loss of trust/funds, regulation that is counter productive, etc.

I own a smoke shop in Chicago and accept bitcoins. Thought it would be useful for that type of business. Only 1 person has used it so far. meh
