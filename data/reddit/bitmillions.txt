To make it more transparent, the draw number is the same as the bitcoin block number.
You can check how many draws site has up to date here
Initial Prizes were ฿ 1,300 BTC, that's why pools are high.

You can place the 90 last, as the order of the numbers doesn't matter. You forgot to read the other option: to send just 1 btc, and let the system pick the numbers for you.. so in any case, you will still get 1 FREE BTC and have nothing to lose

Minimum bet is ฿0.10. The order of the numbers doesn't matter. You can place the ninety on the last digits. And you will get a refund of the difference. If you click the qr code on our site, it will display a pop up to help you choose the numbers and how much you want to be.
Refund = Amount - ( Amount / ฿0.10 )
Does it make sense?

Because of the nature of the game, in BitMillions is impossible for the operator to artificially inflate the number of bets, since the funds from the losing tickets will go to the Prizes Pools and not to the operator itself.
SDICE is completely different, as the administrator will keep the btcs either way.
