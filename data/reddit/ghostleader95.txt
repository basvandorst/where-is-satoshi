First I'm not against any language to learn it's each person choice I like mobile and web development and I don't think C++ will help me creating iOS apps.
Second, why are you so negative to me did I attack you, did I say something that is wrong for what I'm looking for ?
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:55:46
