what is a node vs a channel?

I asked a legitimate question. If the US did create bitcoin this would have so many implications. It would make sense to promote discussion around this, especially concerning the fact that **NO ONE KNOWS THE ANSWER**. I was appalled at how many down votes I got, then I realized you went from +3 karma to -7 right after I replied. It seems like someone doesnt want my comment to get viewed. Why else did your karma count do a 180?

[And it is still being manipulated...](
This is definitely fishy. I guess now it isn't too radical to say that the discussion I tried to be a part of right now was most likely manipulated by the people I was revealing secrets about (US shadow gov't). 
I've heard that, for every activist on the internet there are 5 gov't shills on the opposition.

Doesnt transaction authentication (ie a possible fork in the blockchain) need to be checked by the majority of CPU power in the network? Furthurmore, the majority of CPU power in the network is the mining farmers in china, sweden, iceland, etc. Exchanges take the CPU power away from the many bitcoin users and allow miners to whore the CPU stats. These few can act as a centralized authority on where the blockchain can go.

“If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. “

Do you understand what im saying or should i elaborate? Just working.

Sorry i didnt address your question. Basically, the people involved in these third-party exchanges have opted out of contributing to the cpu power of bitcoin. Instead, the few that farm bitcoin have less cpu competition because the masses have all used exchanges (bit of hyperbole, but you get what im saying).

Also, I just read the rest of this permalink starting from just made a comment about these two bitcoin enthusiasts being shills. I think they are too. But he argued that point terribly and basically set up the replier to shut him down. Which, diffuses AGAIN another legitimate discussion on this post.
Thanks fuckers.

Speaking of naivety, who else here thinks Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for the american empire?

CoinValidtion seems like a ploy designed by someone with some sort of association with the federal reserve. CoinValidation will create a separate market of BTC circulation within the corporate world. This market can be controlled by said centralized (relative to the BTC market outside of corporate culture) entity. Then, authority over a big portion of BTC circulation is catered on a silver platter. Just watch it happen.

It won't be completely useless. Presumably any coins being used outside the circulation of corporate culture will be rendered useless. But, bitcoin is doing beautifully without the hand of corporate culture, you say? Well, once large corps. start to accept bitcoin and it's value as a currency gains mainstream credibility, more people that have already been sucked into the vacuum of corporate crap will join bitcoin and over saturate (since they are becoming the populace) the value of the bitcoin to be favoured in in the corporate hands. You can imagine a giant circle containing all bitcoins in possible circulation. Within that circle is a smaller circle of CoinValidation'd bitcoins. This smaller circle will probably be backed by the legal systems, given 'authenticity' by the news, can be 'validated' by vendors etc. and eventually worth more value since the populace that uses subway or kfc or wal-mart/publix etc. etc. will be circulating it more often than anything being circulated outside this corporate ring. This is when the people have lost as a collective. Bitcoin then goes from decentralized to centralized. The only novelty it will have is it will still work as a frictionless currency (unless they have any other tricks up their sleeve) and the perk of it being completely through the internet. This is the future of bitcoin, presumably, unless the populace smartens up and avoids corporate culture or somehow convinces these big corporations to tell CoinValidation to fuck off. 
Note: sorry for the poor articulation. i am very tired from work and will come back tomorrow to edit this to make it more reader friendly. do you understand the point i am trying to convey?

this is true. but it will pitfall briefly (for a few weeks) and soon by the nature of this article.

this is a psychological ploy. this fail was done on purpose. JPMorgan is knowledgeable enough to know that if it doesn't work the first time, it wont work the next ten times. 175 times is clearly seeking attention.

Im not going to beat around the bush. As near as I can tell, this seems like a twisted attempt/ploy to centralize **a decentralized currency.** Think about it, at the end of the day a third party gets to say what has certain value and what doesn't. This is essentially centralizing a currency to a private faction that doesn't necessarily represent the peoples interest.  Who would attempt such a thing? It is clearly designed by the powers that be i.e. the heads of corporate culture, the 1%, the banks, whatever you want to call them. We all know they exist and want to keep the pyramid upright by any means. If that is the case, I say boycott it and keep BTC the way is was programmed.
Lets say my argument is flawed, though. Maybe I am being myopic, but can someone please explain to me how destroying the fungibility makes the currency any more safe for the users in trade?
