They're using the Blockchain wallet app. The Hive wallet, which also supports what they're doing in the video, does play a fitting sound when the cashier received the payment.

I could imagine a "fast checkout" lane where people can pay with Bitcoin. If designed correctly, such a lane could have a ridiculously high throughput because all that's needed for the user to do is to scan a QR code, press "Send" on their device, and collect the ticket.

Yeah, it'd be a self-service machine.

I think the developer thought nobody would want to type this huge URL into their own computer. They were wrong, 'cause [here's][ass] the home page that the ATM displays.
This is fucking repulsing, and even I could do a better job at making a Bitcoin ATM than these guys do. It's a shame that this opportunity of providing a proper Bitcoin ATM at those special locations is going to waste like that. 
Fuck, a twelve year old nerd could do a better job at making a fucking web page than these guys. Look, this is in the page source.

Seems to be a [special app]( made by BitPay. However, you can also accept payments with other wallet apps, like Hive. I've seen Hive used in POS payments before, it works fine.

AFAIK, Linden Lab is actually pegging the currency to the US dollar in order to maintain a relatively constant exchange rate. 
Furthermore, they assumed control of the exchange market a while ago, barring non-authorized exchanges from trading with Linden Dollars, and only permitting authorized exchanges to let you *buy*, not *sell* L$. All sales of L$ have to go directly through Linden Lab. 
L$ can be useful to make transactions, but it's miles away from being a free-as-in-freedom currency like Bitcoin. Articles 4.3 to 4.7 of their [ToS]( say it nice and clearly (emphasis mine):




**TL;DR:** Linden Dollars are just tokens that you license from Linden Labs, and they have the right to do anything they want with your virtual money - they can remove your access to it, revalue it, and aren't liable when a technical error made your L$ vanish. As far as the ToS go, you have no right to receive monetary redemption for your L$. (Though I can kinda imagine that a court may rule otherwise.)

Unfortunately, mobile phone operating systems are far too complex to provide an adequate guarantee of safety. I'm completely sure that conventional mobile solutions as we have them now can never reach the safety of paper wallets. Future solutions probably aren't going to change this, either.

It's a collectible coin. That's the only point of it, and even the manufacturer says so. Do you see collectible coins in circulation in your country's currency? I think not.

Well, not quite. The letters would have to be on a horizontal line, not a vertical one. Japanese and Chinese are easily readable in both ways because most of the characters have a bounding shape that approximates a square. 
On the other hand, languages based on a more Latin-like script or alphabet have [ascenders and descenders]( which makes them far less suitable for writing from top to bottom. 
You can compare [this] ( picture of Latin text and [this]( picture of Japanese text, both written from top to bottom and illegible, at least as long as you don't speak Japanese. You'll notice that the Japanese text is much easier and far less straining to "read".

They're *supposed* to be safe, yes. Whether they are is an entirely different matter. Mobile wallets are not safe, no matter how much money is stored in them. 
And, yes, I do believe the victim is at fault here as much as the perpetrator is, even if it isn't deemed a nice thing to point out the mistakes of others. 
I lost about 100mBTC because I trusted inputs.io, an online wallet that quite recently got screwed over either by a third party or its owner. And I don't just blame its creator, TradeFortress, for supposedly storing 4100 BTC in a hot pocket wallet on an improperly secured Linode VPS. I blame myself for having trusted an online wallet with an amount of money that I deemed valuable.
And, about OP's latest edit, which added this paragraph:


No, OP. This is not a flaw of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The flaw lies in how you used the Bitcoin system. It's like saying that the fiat ecosystem is flawed because the most simple method of storing fiat for everyday use is lugging around $9,500 in cash to buy a sandwich, and maybe a car if you feel like it. 
I'm sure you'd agree with me that doing that would be an awfully stupid idea - the money may get stolen. So, next time, do it just like you'd do it with fiat: Keep your savings at home, and simply take just a bit of cash on you in case you want to buy something. Subway's not going to increase their prices hundredfold anytime soon.

Your browser usually doesn't care about the file extension of the link you visit. If your browser makes a request to the web site's server, the server actually sends along the file type in the response.
Once your browser connected to the server, a simple HTTP "conversation" between you and a server usually goes like this when you request a file or page.  We're assuming that your browser wants to fetch the image with those things from Despicable Me. 
Note that your browser needs to say the hostname of the website it wants to get the picture from, like "i.imgur.com". Multiple websites can be hosted at one IP address, and when you connect to a web site, you really just connect to the IP address of it that was found out using a DNS query (DNS is a system that turns hostnames like "i.imgur.com" into the IP address 103.31.6.34, among other things). Therefore, the server doesn't know which domain you want to look at, you need to tell it that information.
**Your browser**
    Yo, I want to GET /y6mc8XI.jpg and speak HTTP/1.1.
    The host I am talking about is "i.imgur.com". 
    I am the user agent "superawesomebrowser/2.10 (Linux) some more info".
    I prefer to accept web pages, but you can send me any type of content 
    that you want.
**The server**
    Hey there. I speak HTTP/1.1, too. 
    I'm giving you a status code of 200 - your request was successful.
    I am a "cloudflare-nginx" HTTP server.
    The content type you are getting is "image/gif".
    The content is 505982 bytes long. 
    If you want to keep the content in your cache or are keeping it
    there already, take note of the following:
        The content was last modified Saturday, 17 Aug 2013 11:29:57 GMT.
        You can identify this version of the content by the tag "7e1563ad5f6ebf7c3b6b51150eb03bfb".
        After Friday, 15 Sep 2023 12:34:48 GMT, get a new copy of the content.
    
    If you wish to make another request, you can send it once
    you are done receiving this - I'm keeping the connection alive.
    This is the end of the header. As I got content for you, I'll send it now.

Yup, that's what it's for. It's far from a good solution, but it probably blocks many naively written bots out.

If you need a convincing argument for this, take note:
 [inputs.io]( one of those online wallet services, recently had all of its users' Bitcoins stolen by attackers or the owner himself*. An amount of about 4100 BTC, equaling about 1,913,000 USD with the current exchange rate of 466.5 USD/BTC, are now gone.
\* Nobody's really sure about this, but the circumstances and the way refunds are handled seem very suspicious to me.

Simply sending back does not work - many online wallets like inputs.io that aren't "true" Bitcoin wallets send money from a different address than the user's.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:37:56
Yeah, seriously. That's just asking for somebody to steal your money. Mobile wallets are only suitable for teensy cash amounts. I don't think any "mainstream" mobile platform at all provides enough security for Bitcoin applications.

Actually, they can be encrypted with a passphrase using an algorithm proposed in [BIP 38][bip].  supports generating BIP38-protected paper wallets. Not that it'd be a safe way to make them, but the feature's there.
