Haha. And when I tried telling you how dangerous what you were trying to do was when you posted your crappy prospectus 6 months ago (here:  you assured everyone that you had all these wonderful fail-safe hedging strategies that could handle all the liquidity you needed.
Or to quote you:
"We have a spreadsheet that demonstrates everything, it will be released when I get back to the office, this will show that many of the concerns are created from big misunderstandings of our business model.
Ps. Your right there are not any existing hedging platforms, but we are making changes to this."

I am sorry if you lose money on this and we all want to support the economy but people need to slow down a little and support those that have got on and built things and that have already done everything they can to prove that what they are doing is honest and secure before they go looking for investment.
Throwing money at people with nothing more than a promise to do such things is never a good approach.

This year we are seeing the roll-out of many multi-sig (or "m of n") wallet solutions. A multi- sig transaction does what the name suggests and requires multiple parties to sign the transaction before it can be broadcast to the network. this can just be 2 defined signatories or (m) out of a pool of (n) e.g 3 out of 7 board members at a company.

Without any mentions of the utility and potential use cases as a protocol it's a very incomplete analysis. I don't actually disagree with him entirely with regards to bitcoin as an outright currency - I think we are years from that being a viable possibility.
But the real value lies elsewhere and I'm quite happy for the old guard to miss the point as it will more likely leave bitcoin in the hands of those that actually know what to do with it.

You should really have bought an inexpensive netbook and then installed Armory's offline wallet, never then having to connect your netbook (or your bitcoin stash) to the internet.
Might seem a little confusing at first but practice with small sums and you'll be broadcasting transactions from your offline wallet in around 30 seconds.

@_date: 2014-06-27 10:31:13
Think of colored coins like this. You have a shiny new stack of $1 bills, all worth $1 and all looking exactly the same.
You then get a marker pen and stick your initials in the middle of one of the bills. This note is still worth $1 and anyone would accept it as such but it also has a unique mark (or in bitcoin terms, a color).
You can then decide that this unique, but still valid, $1 bill represents something else. For example, you could prove to someone that you have an ounce of gold in your safe at home and that they can buy that from you for $1200 but that you'll store it for them. In return you give them a receipt and you use your $1 bill with your signature on it as proof of ownership. The $1 bill is still only worth $1 to most people but, if your buyer trusts you for your word, that $1 bill with your signature on can be traded as if it were an ounce of gold if each new owner of that unique bill also trusts that you will redeem the ounce of gold when they decide they want it.
If people trust the issuer of the unique bill (or a colored coin) then it can have any value that people choose to place on it. But the key here is it DOES require trust. Colored coins just allow a way to piggy back the bitcoin blockchain and prove transfer of ownership of an assigned asset has occurred between two parties.
Each satoshi of a bitcoin can be colored in this way. The coloring is only recognised by a colored wallet and if you're ever careless and remove the coloring by sending it to a standard wallet, it just becomes nothing more than one of trillions of other satoshis again.

I flew out to the miami conference from the UK. Went to the ATM to withdraw some dollars with my Barclays debit card when I landed. Card blocked for suspicious attempted use. One hour to sort out eventually via text message.
Flew from Miami to New York. Tried using the same card to pay my hotel deposit. card blocked for suspicious attempted use. No text message option arrived. 
One phone call lasting 5 mins at 1.35GBP per minute only to be told there was nobody that could re-activate it until the next day. 
One night in New York with no money.
Next day, a 25 minute phone call to a call centre in India for a minimum of 1.35 GBP per minute which included at least 10 different security questions and 3 times put on hold while I was verified so that I could use MY debit card to spend MY money on MY vacation. And I had to pay at least 40 GBP for the pleasure of being extremely inconvenienced.

For me, Bitcoin ticks the boxes as an alternative store of value, and in many ways supersedes the qualities of gold. The added bonus is that Bitcoin is also a very cheap and efficient payment network. Gold only came into use as a form of currency once it had established its credentials as a store of value and I believe that Bitcoin will follow that same path with its wider adoption as a means of exchange either growing concurrently or else gaining wider traction further down the line.
The whole idea of inflation being essential to a functioning economy is what we've been conditioned to believe by those that have most to gain out of such a system i.e. those issuing those forms of currency.
In a distant future, will my great great grandchildren choose to sit in darkened rooms hoarding their Bitcoins or will they actually spend it on stuff that makes their life better as we all do today? True, they may not chase dubious investment opportunities just to ensure that the saved rewards of their hard labour can maintain its purchasing power but would that be a bad thing? 
Having a monetary system that has certain deflationary qualities will not mean that the basic needs and desires of human beings will disappear. What may possibly happen is that the basic commodities required to sustain human life and the objects of desire required to sustain human vanity will become far more fairly distributed.

If Bitcoin, or something like it, grows as a recognised alternative store of value against the unchecked inflation of fiat currencies. Maybe people will hoard it as they do now with precious metals. You will find far more gold-bugs out there vehemently defending the characteristics of gold as a store of value, most of whom have little intention of exchanging that gold for any other investment purposes.
Your argument assumes that there could never be a closed loop economy whereby:
- raw commodities are paid for in Bitcoin
- inventory is paid for in Bitcoin
- labour is paid for in Bitcoin
- consumer goods are paid for in Bitcoin
You will only have price instability when measured against existing fiat currencies.
You will have price stability within the Bitcoin based functioning economy

So small businesses get the chance to become more competitive if they choose to use "deflationary" Bitcoin.
Small business buys its stock in dollars. It sells stock for Bitcoins. Retained Bitcoin earnings increase in value against those dollars as it is a deflationary currency of limited supply. Small business can now buy more stock with those Bitcoins than it could with dollars. Small business can now undercut big corporation that refuses Bitcoins and retains faith in ever inflated dollar. Small business gains market share. Big business loses market share.

My preferred method of analysis is Elliot Wave Theory which is why I was talking in terms of waves. 
Best to read Elliot Wave Principle by Robert Prechter to get a full understanding but the general idea is that markets simply map out the inherent modes of human nature and, as humans, we are prone to repeatedly react in the same way over time.
This process is fractal so similar patterns can be spotted when looking at a chart on a 5 minute time scale or a weekly or yearly timescale, for example.
The theory goes that moves in the direction of a trend will advance (in an up-trend or fall in a down-trend) in a 5 wave pattern (impulse wave) where Wave 1 advances, Wave 2 corrects, Wave 3 advances and is usually the strongest advance, Wave 4 corrects (but can't go below the high point of Wave 1 to remain valid) followed by a Wave 5 advance.
Being fractal in nature, each advancing wave (1,3 and/or 5) can, but not always, be subdivided into a smaller 5 wave advancing pattern. 
Impulse waves always follow this structure which, if correctly predicted can offer good risk reward ratios especially if you correctly spot a deep 4th wave correction as your stop loss level will have to be just below/above the top/bottom of Wave 1 with the potential reward of a 5th wave making new highs (or lows depending on trend) for the entire move.
Corrective waves can be much harder to trade as Elliot noted 17 potential patterns which often have the potential to morph and extend but the most common of which form 3 or 5 wave patterns that usually overlap, unlike impulse waves. I also use Fibonacci levels to help predict retracement levels as well as MACD divergence to help spot turning points.
Anyway, such things may make some people giggle but I trade derivatives for a living and it keeps a roof over my head. One of my main markets is German Government Bond Futures and one very recent example shows how useful EW can be.
I'd been tracking a potential large 5 wave pattern forming over the course of most of this year. A potential Wave 1, 2 and 3 looked like they had formed in text-book fashion taking the market from 135.27 to 146.89.
I was then looking for a 4th wave pull-back to take advantage of which should be targeting the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the Wave 3 move at 141.11 and 139.72 respectively. The market sold off firstly to 141.14 before sharply bouncing 200 points. It then sold off further making a low 4 weeks ago at exactly 139.72.
This level, in particular, presented an excellent risk reward opportunity as the potential Wave 1 high had been at 139.32. If the pattern were to play out as projected, a purchase at or near 139.72 would require a stop loss at 139.31 with the potential for a strong move back up to the highs at 146.89 (40ish point risk vs 600 point+ reward).
After the low was made at 139.72 the market rallied with little retracement back up to 146.26 last friday.
So, that's just one example of many I could give. It may make some people giggle and that's fine for them. Those 2 recent German bond trades certainly made me smile i can tell ya!!
Don't get me wrong, it's a subjective method and potential 5 wave moves can easily morph into expanded corrective patterns, catching you out, but it certainly can offer some very good opportunities.

@_date: 2012-10-12 18:29:51
Why such a black and white opinion? What about a market driven shift towards a balance between saving and hoarding? It's only in a fractional reserve world where a you have to hand over ALL of your wealth to a so-called "trusted" third party to "invest" on your behalf. Holders of Bitcoins will want to see innovation and as decentralised Webs of Trust develop more Bitcoins will be loaned out. Maybe only a small percent on average at first but the relative success of new layers of security that materialise will govern the average amount loaned out and the interest rate those loans will yield.  Better security and peer-to-peer ratings systems will lead to more money being loaned and lower rates paid in return. The market will become much more reactive to real time adjustments in the economy and economic cycles may well be much smoother.
So some would always be hoarded but that counts as a REAL deposit insurance scheme. As long as it's stored safely there will be no need for some spurious insurance guarantee that will only ever be paid out using the latest mulch from Bernanke's printing press.
@_date: 2012-12-30 23:02:03
At least with deflation there is ultimately a floor. With inflation there is no ceiling. 
Since the final break from any form of peg to gold in 1971 inflation has very disproportionately benefited those in western economies that have been able to turn excess savings into hard assets. However, the vast majority in those economies have seen a consistent erosion to their standard of living, only being able to keep up by taking on excessive debt which is far more detrimental to productivity than any sort of deflation.

Your loss if you don;t wanna follow technicals. So far Bitcoin has been behaving remarkably well from a technical point of view espesh when compared to the heavily manipulated stock markets in recent years.
Perfect looking five wave parabolic advance took us from zero to 30 bucks. What usually happens after a parabolic spike? A 90% retracement. Oh yeah, that's what we got. And said retracement took the form of a classic overlapping pattern. 
What should we have expected once we broke through the top of the 4.80 - 5.20 range we'd been stuck in? Oh yeah, a strong move higher, and with 5 non-overlapping waves. Hmmm. Guess what?
And then one might expect a classic 3 or 5 wave overlapping consolidation pattern (maybe in the form of a triangle). Oh yeah....
Nothing's certain and patterns can morph but Bitcoin looks like a fine market with which to take heed of technicals. If the zero - 30 buck move does eventually turn out to be the first wave up in a large 5 wave up move, hold on to your hats if we break through the previous all time high.

If we are to see wide spread adoption then the majority of people are going to want services similar to those that they are already used to with a comparable ease of use. Maintaining and securing their own wallets will just not cut the mustard with the majority of less tech-savvy users.

I disagree absolutely but am sure that many will share the OP's opinion, something that I also have no problem with. Bitcoin already means many things to its small band of followers. Whilst I respect those that value most highly its aspects that allow anonymity and anti-statist potential, those same people also want to see Bitcoin grow. 
The reality is that the majority of the people that are potential users but have yet to even hear of, let alone understand Bitcoin will be less interested in such features. A better alternative to fiat currency that cuts transaction fees and banking costs will likely be enough for most. They'll most likely want to continue to hand over their personal details to ensure that their groceries and books get delivered to their homes rather than just being dumped in the street.
So far, in its early days, Bitcoin has had to navigate a PR minefield. The Bitcoin Foundation has made it its remit to help overcome these issues which, in turn, will help bring the technology to a wider audience in a much more positive and professional light.
Bitcoin will still be Bitcoin. If the majority of the community shuns the whole notion then Bitcoin will continue on its path, wherever that path may lead, irrespective of The Bitcoin Foundation. 
Bitcoin's strength has always been based on being driven by what the majority of the community wants it to be. This changes none of that but, in my opinion, the majority of users will ultimately see greater overall benefit from this development.

Indeed. And as such gives zero indication of where Bitcoin may end up.
"Plateau of Productivity" — A technology reaches the "plateau of productivity" as the benefits of it become widely demonstrated and accepted.

But a pure gold standard backing each individual currency proved to be too inflexible in itself hence the bretton woods agreements which did seem to work quite well as a quasi gold standard until nixon did away with it completely, ultimately bringing us to where we are today. Even Gold backed currency is open to abuse as the common man would never really know who has what gold and where it actually is. In my opinion, this is the key factor where Bitcoin trumps gold

Isn't this covered already with multi-signature transactions?
As I understand it, it will be possible for the 3rd signature to be signed by a bot once a criteria, such as a UPS delivery code, has been met. Bitcoin's committed but not released until delivery has been proven. Better than charge backs.

"Human error and manipulation is one of the biggest problems when conducting cryptocurrency trades and negating these factors or even removing them entirely is a very important step for these transactions to become truly accepted and global" Atomic swaps often don't take into account market exposure risk. The refund mechanism means that a period of time to pass before a tx is forced to either settle or fail. If within that time period the market derived value of one asset in the tx changes significantly, there is a major incentive for one party to pull out of what, under centralised matching/execution conditions, would have been considered a valid trade. To counter this you would still require a trusted 3rd party to adjudicate, albeit potentially under conditions where they themselves could not gain financially. As I always say to people, we are not necessarily building trustless systems, just systems that require less trust
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:39:15
Have always thought this is the way to go. Dare i mention the word but this would also enable a market driven, transparent fractional reserve mechanism to allow for elasticity in the money supply.
Fractional reserve is bad when nobody really has any clue how much the reserve has been fractioned. With Bitcoin that goes away as the reserve is encumbered by the network and any certificates/notes issued on top are verifiable.
If someone wanted to issue 1.1 notes against a single bitcoin then the money supply expands by 10%, bit only if the market accepts it. In a healthy economy where people on the ground feel the economy is doing well they might be happy accepting that note if satisfied that there won't be a rush to redeem for the base currency.
If the market feels like it can handle a 1.2x note then so be it. If someone tries offering 1.9x notes in a twitchy economy then good luck,  but the market will decide what the upper limit is  based real time feedback on their perception of the state of the economy.

He's asked to meet next time he's in London to discuss more.

Had been thinking about this (selling at cost anyway) but if successful ur gonna have to pay suppliers to re-stock so you'd have to be changing your coins back to fiat. Even if you can convince your supplier to accept bitcoins you'd still be losing the desired benefit. 
Eventually, for bitcoin to succeed there will need to be a closed loop economy where each link in the supply chain trades in bitcoin 
For this to happen people need to want to be paid for their labour in bitcoin. That's when it will start to really fulfil its potential

I'm sure you are smart enough my friend. But most bitcoin advocates would like to see it become a ubiquitous global currency. The only way that will happen is for bitcoin to become so easy to use that the dumbest kid in your class will be using it, probably without even knowing.

I'm sorry, but while a applaud your desire to promote bitcoin, you're projecting to take in 33m Euro of deposits by this time next year and making a whole load of assumptions that everything will be a smooth and steady ride for the bitcoin market.
I believe bitcoin has a future but asking depositors to effectively invest large sums of their savings in bitcoin as an alternative to protecting them from the recent confiscations without a clearly defined and guaranteed hedging strategy is wrong. And even if you did have such a strategy, the bitcoin ecosystem is not nearly well established enough to handle such volumes. Where is the bitcoin derivatives market that you could safely hedge 400,000 bitcoins?
"When they withdraw, other deposits will be made which will eat some of that requirement up"
Really? Was there another line at the banks in Cyprus earlier this year with people waiting to pay in Euros whilst everyone in the other line wanted to get all of theirs out?

With the US Dollar having lost 97% of its purchasing power in the last 100 years, and with the inability for Bitcoins to be abused in the same way, it's probably better to compare it to gold instead. Supposedly there's in the region of 160,000 tonnes (or 5.1bn ounces) of gold above ground which equates to around $8.1tn. Or just over $400,000 per Bitcoin were they ever be equally valued. I'd settle for Bitcoin reaching 1% the value of gold in that case.

@_date: 2013-02-09 21:23:14
I have to disagree. Bitcoin is getting stronger day by day but is still nowhere near mainstream. If or when it does start going mainstream it will take time to build but if you reach a point where it becomes dinner party talk then another real rush to enter may start. And it will go too fast and far for a while and then correct again, possibly quite deeply. No different from how the dotcom boom played out. 
But the dotcom industry didn't die. The infrastructure was laid down and the fitest survived. No different from the railway boom before that. 
A bitcoin chart, like the chart of any security or commodity, is just showing you waves of collective human emotion and those emotions always overshoot. They always have. 
Maybe today will be the second highest wave of positive emotion directed towards Bitcoin and that will be it. I personally very much doubt that will be the case though.

Why not just get the merchants to use a payment gateway such as Bitpay where the BTC/[local currency] exchange rate adjusts in real time and, if the merchant so chooses, can have their Bitcoins exchanged back to their local currency on a daily basis if they decide they don't want to hold Bitcoins?

As with any form of analysis it is, of course, subjective. I'll run through an example for you.
The move from inception in 2009 into the speculative spike to $30 formed 5 waves and a pretty classic parabolic blow off. Subsequently, as is common with such bubbles, 90%-ish of the move is given back. Compare to the nasdaq bubble into 200  
The fall back to $2-ish would likely conform to a corrective pattern (counter to the overriding trend) and the market started a bounce back up although there's no way of knowing at this point if it is just an extension of the correction from the highs.
This move topped at just over $7 (let's say $7.10 for reference). Here you may pencil that in as a Wave 1. After that we consolidated sideways for a while down to just over $4. The move was made up of lots of overlapping waves which indicates corrective action (rather than a clear 5 wave impulse move where wave 2 fails to fall below the start of wave 1 and wave 4 fails to fall below the top of wave 1).
So, pencil that in as wave 2 and see if we then break back above the top of wave 1 ($7.10) and extend higher. If so this may be wave 3 forming, especially if it is quite strong (wave 3 is usually the longest wave and never the shortest).
We did move up and the move did prove to be quite strong but it would be very difficult to predict where it would stop. However, so far, so good for this possibility.
Now that we potentially have these 3 waves and we have our reference of the possible wave 1 high at $7.10. IF wave 3 tops out and then corrects lower it will only remain valid if it bottoms out above $7.10 otherwise something else is happening. 
We did get a sharp sell of from just over $15 and the first wave of that sell off bottomed out above $7.10 (just under $8). At this point you have a v good risk/reward opportunity. If the pull back is strong and it turns out to be a 4th wave then you'd be giving yourself good odds. Say you were happy to have a $2 or $3 stop on your buy orders you can start buying below $10 with a stop just below $7.10. IF the pattern remains valid then wave 5, if it unfolds, should go beyond the top of wave 3 ($15). Therefore your risk is $2-$3 and your potential reward is $6 plus. As it turned out the risk skew went as far as $1 risk to over $7 reward)
In this specific instance you had some further confirmation of this view when, over the next few months, the sideways consolidation formed a triangle pattern of ever decreasing lows and highs into a point around $12.50. Elliott deduced that triangle patterns only form in 4th wave corrections so now you have a potential wave 1, 2 and 3 that fit the bill and a potential wave 4 that has stayed above the high of wave 1 and also formed a triangle pattern. From a trading point of view you could judge that the odds are in your favour that the next move will be to the upside which is what transpired in this case.
In the real world there are, of course, many failed example of such patterns but, in those cases, at least you would have maintained a tight strategy for managing your risk.
Each of these larger waves are made up of smaller subwaves and in this whole pattern the larger waves have also generally been made up of smaller waves that have also remained within the defined patterns and triangles have appeared in what could be counted as minor 4th waves on at least 3 occasions. 
The reason I find it interesting is that our capital markets have moved away from being driven by human emotion due to centrally planned intervention and these patterns have become far more erratic.
Bitcoin is brand new and free from such things and it's pretty cool to see how these things are mapping out in a market that is much more driven by human emotion alone.

Now imagine it's 1992 and from its start the HTTP protocol had been divided into a fixed number of units and you'd been able to buy and sell those units.

Sounds like what Jamie Dimon and John Corzine said and look what happened there. And they had the most liquid and established derivatives markets to play with.
How about proving that this "strategy" works even on 100 bitcoins before you start trying to apply it to 400,000 bitcoins and before you risk 4.5m of investors' money and 33m Euros of your depositors' money trying to prove it?

Bitstamp have been around for some time now and are well respected - if you're buying a reasonable amount of coins then I'd say they are one of your best bets. As with all exchanges though, be wary of leaving any significant sums of money and/or bitcoins there longer than absolutely necessary.
I've bought and sold on local bitcoins and it's good, even for reasonable amounts - just make sure your seller has a good reputation.
If you;re in Ireland, there's BitBargain which works in a similar way and are pretty good. 
If you can do UK faster payments via your bank then i can also recommend bittylicious.com. Very easy to use service and the more verified you get, the more you can buy so kinda up to you how much info you give
before you buy your coins, open a web wallet at blockchain.info/mywallet.
blockchain.info are one of the most respected bitcoin brands. Their's is what is known as a hybrid wallet which offers the convenience of a web based service but offers much of the security that securing your own wallet on your PC delivers.
But make sure you have all security features enabled and don;t lose your passwords as that will likely mean your coins are lost for good. However, you can backup your blockchain.info wallet.dat file and if they were to ever disappear then you could still access your coins via another bitcoin client such as MultiBit
You will see the bitcoin transaction take place on the public ledger. Once the seller sends them you should see the transaction come into your wallet very quickly. However, it will say "unconfimed" at first - this is where the transaction has been broadcast to the network. After 10 minutes you'll start seeing it flagged as "confirmed" which is where the first miner has actually included the transaction in a block. It's widely accepted that 6 confirmations are required to be sure that a transaction can't be reversed by a malicious actor. 
The reality is that it kinda depends on the amount. It really would not be worth someone trying to double spend a transaction that is worth €1 so a single confirmation is likely fine. But if you're sending €1m you'd better wait for a whole load more
Hope that helps.

I disagree. From an Elliott Wave point of view bitcoin is showing an uncanny number of typical patterns and that works on any timescale so there's more than enough data. 
To me that makes sense. Elliott's whole theory was that the waves mapped human emotion which was exactly what drove markets back then, far more than today's markets that now trade off the next central planner's role of the dice and not much else. Bitcoin doesn't suffer from that.

TA just tracks human emotions so how mature the market is shouldn't matter. I'd in fact say the opposite that, compared to most of today's capital markets, bitcoin is far far less manipulated and skewed by centralised bodies such as our central banks.

Don't keep Bitcoins on an exchange longer than you have to and don't use a pooled web wallet. Store your own Bitcoins properly and then you don;t need to worry.
Everyone knows that exchanges are a weak link in the Bitcoin ecosystem but, for now, the most trusted ones are the most convenient way of exchanging fiat for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:56:38
I did this myslef for the first time only last week.
Armory is recognised as being the best wallet if you want to store your Bitcoins completely offline.  You do need to install the Bitcoin QT client and let it sync with the blockchain (which takes many hours) before you install Armory.
I did take their advice and purchase a cheap notebook that has never (and will never) touched the internet.
Once installed you can install a "watch only" version on your online computer and still very easily sign transactions if you do want/need to send coins somewhere. I think most people taking the cold storage route keep a small number online for convenience and the bulk offline. Just depends how often you make transactions.
You can also easily add a "watch only" address on your blockchain.info wallet so you can check your coins are still there any time you want.
Once you're set up (make sure your wallet is encrypted, btw) just do a few test transactions and backups/re-imports with small amounts to make sure you're comfortable.
The only thing you have to do is make sure you have multiple backups of your encrypted wallet also stored offline on pen drives and, as with any wallet, make sure you don't forget your password. You can also make a paper wallet backup but these are un-encrypted so you really do need to make sure that it's stored safely if you take that option.
It is a bit scary if you're not overly familiar with all the various bits but, ultimately, as long as you always have access to your encrypted wallet file and your password you'll always be able to recover your coins. 
Good luck!

I know it's not exactly the sort of thing that you could get the majority to sign up to at once but if everyone gave way 20% of their Bitcoins in this way then it's possible their remaining 80% would be worth a lot more than they would have been as Bitcoin starts to get a wider reach.
Even if everyone gave away far more than that and those coins were distributed as thinly as possible then in relative terms those early adopters' remaining holdings would still be large in relative terms.

Only adding to what I mentioned in yesterday's post in that I think they did a great job in getting the message across on a subject that normally scares people from trying to understand (sounds familiar!) irrespective of one's  opinion on the credibility of the content. 
However, I think it's time to improve Bitcoin's visual identity so I'd hope to see a solution that graphically helps to enforce Bitcoin as a serious concept. The same style as American Dream wouldn't necessarily cut it for me. There would need to be designated stake-holders who could assist in creative direction, narrow down concepts and then possibly put those to a vote amongst contributors.
I'd also like to think that we could fund this through donations if the Bitcoin Foundation isn't involved (or even if they are).

I've posted a few times over the last year that the current exchange model sucks and no serious investors would buy into it. You work at Gox and see you have loads of fiat coming onto the exchange you can draw an obvious conclusion. Likewise a sharp inflow of Bitcoins into the exchange. The problem is compounded by the fact that only one product is traded. Sports exchanges work on a similar model but they have no way of knowing how a user is going to trade as they offer thousands of products to trade.
This is not how it works on any other recognised capital market.
I'm not throwing round conspiracy theories. I trade for a living. I'm not bothered by what is happening. I'm in for the long term and recent activity has drawn useful attention to Bitcoin and these events will ultimately lead to better solutions than we have now.
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:40:08
Surely if Gox do indeed have liquidity issues it is in their best interest not to quash the speculation. Let everyone think they can't get their dollars out thus encouraging them to turn their fiat balances into bitcoin and make sure you (Gox) are offering your large bitcoin holding all the way up. Hey presto, you get the best price possible price for your bitcoins and liquidity issues are solved

For ease of use and convenience you can try bittylicious.com. You'll pay a premium over the exchange prices but if ur just buying small and it's ur first time it's possibly worth the extra few percent. 
Just make sure you have a wallet set up before hand. Blockchain.info/mywallet ur best bet but make sure you enable extra security such as 2FA and it's a good idea to install and use their chrome extension once you're all set up 
If your buying more than a small sum then bitstamp and bips.me are good European options but it may take a day or two to verify ur account with documents 
A seller with good rating on localbitcoins should be good too. Have bought and sold in there a few times

I heard that piece on radio 4 on Friday. It was indeed terrible. Tbh, I don't think that's a bad thing at this stage. Bitcoin is doing just fine but it runs the danger of getting ahead of itself way before the infrastructure is ready for the main stream. No point getting the masses on board and then scaring them off for ever as they encounter the various growing pains that bitcoin will necessarily need to endure over the coming months/years.

I was specifically not likening it to a company. It is a protocol but the first one ever that you can buy a share in. If you want to compare it to something then it should be a commodity such as gold.
I have always thought that it would first become a recognised alternative store of value but one that has this extra utility of also being a payment network. That aspect will only take hold once people are comfortable and trusting of it. It has to get to that point first though and that is the phase we are potentially experiencing at present.
Think of the internet as an information network of virtually unlimited bandwidth. Being unlimited in size, HTTP itself has no real monetary value.
Bitcoin is a value transfer network and, as such, has to be limited in "bandwidth". If you own bitcoin you effectively own a portion of that limited bandwidth and that's where its value is derived

BTW, no bitcoins sit in your wallet or anybody else's wallet. All your wallet does is secure your private keys that give you the right to transfer the ownership of your bitcoins to someone else. ALL records of ALL bitcoin transactions and ownership only exist on the public distributed ledger that is The Blockchain (nothing to do with blockchain.info btw, they just chose that name because they provide the service that allows anyone to easily view bitcoin transactions)

As I posted a few days back, in terms of scale, this move doesn't yet compare with the 2011 bubble.
It may well top out for now and fall back some - who knows - but in terms of bubble-nomics and in terms of the increased user base since summer 2011 Bitcoin is still too far from mainstream to be at the top of the next real bubble.

As much as I hate banks as much as the next man, it does seem that those in the UK are being made to get with the times much faster than those in the US. 
With blockchain.info you can buy coins using Barclays' Pingit service which is a smartphone app that utilises the UK's faster payment service that banks are being made to use which allows very fast (pretty much instant for a Barclays to Barclays transaction) payment between UK accounts, linked via users' mobile phone numbers.
I use it a lot and my coins are in my wallet in literally seconds and they're safe from chargebacks although blockchain.info's fees are quite steep. Unlike Coinbase, blockchain.info don't have access to your private keys however.
That's all well and good but it is also worth bearing in mind that this level of convenience may act as decent competition to the convenience that it is hoped Bitcoin will bring from a daily transaction point of view at least
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:13:19
Yep. And going by the FinCen ruling you'll also then be able to skip paying tax on the capital gains on your coins. Sweet
@_date: 2013-09-28 10:12:15
In a scenario where colored coins were used to issue a 100% reserve pegged local currency (e.g. GBPCOINS or USD COINS) the issuer could also charge very small fees for the payment processing of this currency therefore giving them a yield on their locked in bitcoin investment. A yield would be appropriate because the person supplying the coins for use as the pegged currency would not be guaranteed of ever getting them back (although it is likely whilst the value of the satoshis representing GBPCOIN are far lower than their pegged value). The issuer is also carrying the exchange rate risk of the underlying bitcoins whereas the user of the pegged currency isn't (but is getting the benefits of the bitcoin payment network).
Bitcoin owners would effectively be renting "bandwidth" on the network.
If this was to scale then there would be progressively be a smaller supply of bitcoins for general use and could therefore start to bring deflationary pressure. But that deflation would make sense because it would indicate demand to use the payment network.
Eventually (a long long time from now!) if that demand became great enough, the satoshis representing the pegged currency could equal the value of the pegged currency itself and there would then be no need for the coloring to remain - they could just be used as bitcoins. In reality, the risk to the issuer would become too high well before the values reached a 1:1 ratio but less supply of pegged coins would likely create greater demand for un-colored coins anyway.
As long as the issuer had been re-investing his yield in bitcoins he too would be no worse off as he'd have recouped the coins he's now unlikely to get back. Of course, if the colored coin users were confident enough in bitcoin itself to release their coloring then the issuer would also have the fiat currency that he was holding in reserve which you'd imagine would be becoming pretty worthless at this point.
What you would effectively be doing is giving bitcoins their maximum value now and letting the value when messured against existing fiat currencies grow into it down the line.

We'll have to agree to disagree. Just because a market cap gets big it doesn't mean it has to stay big. What was the market cap of silver in the spring of 2011? Whatever it was it is 40% less now. If Bitcoin survives and you look back at the charts in 100 years you will see the same kind of swings.
A big rise built on growing awareness and adoption for online gambling followed by some kind of government action against it. That might create some kind of large rush for the exit, even if still temporary.

Agreed that pump and dump type manipulation is not regulated in the same way (although there is plenty of abuse in ordinary markets that goes unpunished). But that ticker painting is really only influencing minor short term fluctuations. When the real money wants to move the market such painting has little real impact.
Anyway, it will be interesting how the charts look in a couple of years time. I remember when the 2011 spike to $32 dollars looked huge and disproportionate to the rest of the chart. Now it just looks like a minor blip

You'll find different opinions regarding the definition of deflation. The one that i subscribe to is the increase in the value if money, the side effect of which is falling prices. 
It all depends on which way round you decide cause and effect sit.

How exactly will you be hedging against btc/euro volatility for the euro-pegged accounts? Basing your projections on historical price movements is ridiculous. 
This statement is based on completely unforeseeable assumptions:
"The sum of all MtGox ask orders is roughly 47,000 BTC. If the market remains constant until February 2014, and no new orders are added, we could consume all Mt. Gox liquidity in just over two weeks. Because of this, we expect strong price increases upon accepting deposits. The “Snowball” effect, where other traders see a bullish market and
buy into it, is likely to exacerbate our purchases’ effects."
What is your analysis of MtGox liquidity for a scenario where a large number of your depositors want to convert btc back to euros whilst maintaining 100% euro equivalent reserves for all your depositors?

It also acts as an alternative store of value so those properties are important to take into consideration.
There was a time when gold wasn't used as a medium of exchange. It only became useful for that purpose once disparate populations came to learn that other societies, previously unknown to them, also placed a value on it and were therefore prepared to trade it for goods.
Recognising the value of something is the first step. Using it commonly as a medium of exchange comes somewhere down the line.
 I really don't think there is a rush to get merchants on board. It will already be a perfect fit for some business models but certainly not all.
The more value that is placed on Bitcoin the more early adopters will be prepared to re-invest some of their gains back into the Bitcoin economy that will in turn improve infrastructure and therefore further improve Bitcoin's usefulness as a medium of exchange.
As long as Bitcoin remains on this path many new layers will be built on top of the existing core protocol that will make it even more useful as a form of money in the years to come than it is now.

I'm afraid there will never be a way of avoiding that. A Bitcoin chart will look like any other chart when you look back at it in months/years to come. 
That's why I don't believe Bitcoin will become widely used as a medium of exchange for some time. Perhaps only when more and more people are receiving some of their pay in Bitcoins. 
It will certainly grow in certain niche areas for now and I do think that online gaming is going to spur its growth. But even then there will be a day when gamblers wake up one morning and they've lost all their recent winnings (or the cash they've just bought in at) in a sharp Bitcoin price drop which will likely dent the newly gained positive image.
I do believe it will all happen eventually but it will be a long road and there's just no point in thinking it possible to smooth out the ride in some way.
@_date: 2013-09-18 12:10:58
No. But he's one of the few people in that conversation with any sense. Seriously, a lot of people need to come down from their bitcoin clouds a bit and take a reality check. 
If that prospectus was put in front of any normal investor and told what they were valuing the company at they would be laughed out of town it has so many holes in it.
Bitcoin will hopefully be able to do all the things that we all hope it will be capable of but there are so many more important things that should be developed first to allow for a solid foundation for all of these things at a later date. that can then be SAFELY rolled out.

We have seen how much awareness has been raised by two relatively large services announcing their support for Bitcoin. We can't be sure, but it is likely that this kind of pattern will be repeated.
However, "support" for Bitcoin should really be backed by action.
The cost of entry for users and the administrative and cost overhead explained by Yishan actually prove that, for now, the cost benefits that Bitcoin purports to provide don't actually yet exist.
Furthermore, the model whereby merchants and service providers convert all of their Bitcoins immediately back to their local currency doesn't convey their complete trust in Bitcoin - not that they should have any more complete trust in Bitcoin that anyone else should at this stage.
But if we imagine that those early businesses brave enough to experiment with Bitcoin will also help spread trust in the system then it should also be worthwhile to start retaining at least part of their Bitcoin income as Bitcoins.
I know business models need to be adhered to and profit margins maintained but if Reddit and Wordpress had decided to retain 10-15% of their Bitcoin income in Bitcoins then the subsequent increase in Bitcoin's value that their acceptance helped to spur would have meant these unforeseen overheads would have been more than paid for already, if not actually become more profitable.
I cannot state strongly enough how great it is that services such as Reddit and Wordpress have taken the plunge and shown support for something they, and all of us believe in.
But, in the long run, full "support" of Bitcoin will have to be backed by trust in retaining Bitcoins. Fortunately, no business has to go all in but a small dip of the toe should be taken.
It may well work to their own and the whole Bitcoin economy's benefit.
@_date: 2013-01-31 11:13:07
If you compare the press reports over the last 6 months to those during 2011 and early 2012 then it would suggest that Bitcoin is now being presented in a more positive light which is likely to make more people sit up and take interest. 
The market cap is still just over $200m. That really isn't very insane in terms of the global economy. 
I agree that real growth is what is required but there isn't a market in the world that doesn't experience smaller spurts of excessive exuberance and fear within a larger unfolding trend.

Couldn't agree more. It will be alt coins that create the crypto currency bubble with gains in value akin to all those companies that gained multi million dollar valuations during the dot-com bubble just because they put an "e" in front of their name.

This document seems to state that financial institutions (i.e. their banks) are banned from offering bitcoin services (running an exchange, storage, mortgages(!!) etc) but it also states that other services are fine as long as they follow the correct AML rules etc. Also, that bitcoin is a virtual commodity and not a currency and they will watch developments.

it could well be but many prefer to look at the log scale charts which paint a different picture and are useful where new technologies experience exponential growth. (play with the chart settings on a weekly Gox chart on bitcoinwisdom.com and you'll see what I mean.
Even so, bitcoin has already experienced at least three moves that could be considered bubbles at the time thought look less so in hindsight.
These bubbles will continue but if you look at a chart for apple stock over the last 20 years you can count many instances of what whould have seemed like bubbles and crashes at the time on their ultimate journey to last year's highs

That parabolic spike on the left may one day look like a quite minor move at the far left of the chart.
Or it may not.
But fundamentally we are a long way from where we were back then and the foundations are much more solid. If that first spike is to be repeated it will most likely happen on a much larger scale and, if so, we could just be at the very early stages of that pattern unfolding. I think breaking through the previous nominal all-time high will be quite telling if it happens.
You must also remember that all that first spike did was grab the attention of a few extra geeks. Times that by an evolution to mainstream attention.

The long string of numbers you give the seller is a bitcoin address. That is the public key to the private key that only you control. The most the person you give the address to can do is accidentally send you more bitcoins.
The private key is in your wallet which why you need to make sure you use strong passwords and 2FA to protect your wallet. If someone steals your private key then they have control over your bitcoins.

If it wasn't called bitcoin and wasn't pitched as a currency but was instead called VTPP (value transfer payment protocol) and was billed as the first open protocol that could carry value across the internet just like TCP/IP or SMTP came about to carry information across the internet before it, would you think that there might be some potential in the years to come to build upon it?

No, you're not alone, but at the moment I'm happy to see Bitcoin utilised in this way.
However, I do believe that artists, whatever their chosen format, should be rewarded for their art if others who don't have the talent to produce their own want to gain pleasure from the artist's work.
What I'd hope (and preferably expect) to see is that Bitcoin applications evolve to mean that shared files come at a price, paid for in Bicoins, that route their way to back to the artist wherever the file in question has been downloaded from.
Perhaps, down the line, artists will be able to embed an autonomous Bitcoin agent (concept posted on Reddit yesterday  that will allow a micro-payment to work its way back to the artist's wallet every time their music, software, video etc is shared and downloaded. The artist gets rewarded and the evil mega-corporation is still cut out of the loop.
Let Bitcoin evolve in the messy and convoluted manner that it has to for now but let's hope, in doing so, it will lead to better solutions all round.

You can't just measure Bitcoin's value purely on the size of it's existing economy. Bitcoin, in theory, also functions as an excellent store of value and in those terms it is potentially massively undervalued.
It has always been my belief that it is this aspect that will fuel Bitcoin's early growth anyway with real adoption as a widely used medium of exchange only gaining traction down the line once it is trusted as a store of value in the same way that gold eventually became recognised as a useful medium of exchange AFTER it became a widely coveted metal.
Fortunately with Bitcoin it has the added benefit of already being useful as a medium of exchange for certain parts of the economy which will allow both factors to support it's perceived value at the same time to a degree.

I'd go with blockchain either way as you have more control over the safe keeping of your coins as longs as you make sure everything is properly backed up.
If you're based in the UK, even more so. Their Pingit purchase option, whilst a little expensive with 5.8% fees, has to be the easiest way of buying Bitcoins out there. I use it lots and I get my coins within seconds and there's no chance of deals being cancelled in the way that seems to be the case with Coinbase this week.

And this is the same with all the exchanges and I have been saying this for 2 years. All exchanges have inside information as they know both when an above average amount of fiat or bitcoins hits the exchange way before the users can submit their buy and sell orders 
The sane thing happened in April on MtGox. A huge sell order just before they announced they were suspending trading. I have no proof but it's highly possible it was gox selling their own stash before breaking the news. 
These are more reasons that show the whole exchange system and therefore most of bitcoins value is way too fragile and reaching a point where exchanges can operate without handling client funds via a clearing system would take years to evolve if at all

All fundamentals do is affect the emotion that is subsequently depicted on the chart. News that Coinlab is suing MtGox? Fundamental news which is plotted on the chart for all time

No you can't predict what fundamentals will drive the next moves. And neither fundamental analysis nor technical analysis will give you any definite foresight. But chart patterns do, and always will repeat themselves. All you should use them for is to calculate good entry and exit points that put the risk/reward in your favour.
I can't say for sure that we are currently in a fourth wave corrective pattern but it fits the bill right now. If wrong, below $31.90 would be an obvious level for a stop loss on a long position. 
Based on that assumption, any purchase not too far above $31.90 would give you a relatively tight risk ratio compared to a reward target way above $266 if the pattern did indeed hold true. That would be a very good risk/reward ratio and would be good trade management.
@_date: 2013-02-09 17:16:53
But we don't know what percentage of people are just recognising Bitcoin as potentially a very good store of value too. They're buying for the long term not just short term speculation. If speculators get carried away any pull backs will eventually be met by the long-termers.

You can send funds any time to a public key generated by your offline wallet without ever connecting it to the internet (which is the point)
Your offline wallet should always stay offline and you sign a transaction that you instigate with your online (view only) wallet via a flash drive. You should also follow their instructions for disabling auto-run when you plug your flash drive in to mitigate against viruses.

I don't get how people call every up move a bubble. This move up may well correct lower but it doesn't fit the classic shape of a bubble, unlike the parabolic spike of 2011.
If people want to see their expectations of Bitcoin becoming more widely adopted being fulfilled they're going to have to get used to the price going up!

I trade for a living and Elliott Wave Theory combined with Fibs and MACD  is my preferred method of tech analysis. I don't day trade Bitcoin but keep an eye on the charts and it has so far formed many classic EW patterns which I find interesting. The idea behind Elliott Wave Theory is that it maps human emotion and the waves of greed and fear in a fractal manner on all time-scales from a 1 minute chart to a 100 year chart. 
Nothing is going to give you a 100% success rate when predicting markets but what I like about EW is that it can be very handy in helping you manage your risk/reward ratios. For example, to remain valid, 4th wave corrections can NEVER fall back within the range of the first wave. If you have an idea that the market is forming a 4th wave correction you know your stop loss level HAS to be just below the high point of the potential wave 1 high whilst your profit target is likely to be many times further away than your stop.
I've been meaning to post a few charts on here showing how the waves seem to have unfolded over the last 4 years. Will try and do so soon. 
For what it's worth, the move into the recent highs from the last 2011 lows does potentially count as a completed 5 wave impulse move so a reasonable period of consolidation may be due. Unfortunately, corrective waves are notoriously difficult to predict. Can be shallow, can be deep. Will just wait and see how it pans out.

My issue is not with whether their investors clean up or lose their money (I couldn't care less), my issue is with them potentially giving the false impression to their depositors that their savings are safer in this entity than in a bank - even a Cypriot bank - and the potential damage that could do to bitcoin's reputation. If they had given any evidence whatsoever of how they can successfully hedge the 400,000 bitcoins they forecast they will be managing this time next year in order to protect their depositors fiat balances I might give them some credit. But they haven't because there is no way of doing it.
If you think "we will make a profit because bitcoin prices will rise coz we're going to be buying loads of them" is a sensible strategy then good luck to ya

I have followed your thread on bitcointalk since you announced this and I have still not seen you give a satisfactory answer to the questions I raised last week.
You are attempting to expose a lot of people to fluctuations in the value of bitcoin and marketing it to them as a safe alternative to having their money in the bank.
Saying you have hedging strategies but give no indication how these will work is not helpful in any way. THERE IS NO EXISTING METHOD OF SAFELY HEDGING THE AMOUNT OF BITCOINS YOU ARE INTENDING TO BE EXPOSED TO.
You have not explained how you will circumvent the capital controls you are currently exposed to in Cyprus to obtain your bitcoins as I assume you will not be getting your full supply from coins mined within Cyprus.
You are valuing you yet-to-be-launched company at €4.5m and still have not filled half of the seats on your board. 
Honestly, I would love to see this kind of solution gain traction in the long run but the bitcoin ecosystem is nowhere near ready to support the type of risk management that is essential to your business model.
If something like this fails on a large scale because it was launched way too soon then it could do a whole lot of harm to the reputation of bitcoin and its like.
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:15:37
Valid point and, at this stage, you're kinda right. But it's more about creating a more closed loop economy.
For now most merchants will need to convert at least a large part of their coins back to fiat to pay their bills and pay suppliers.
Eventually, the merchant may keep pestering his supplier to accept bitcoins or his staff might start asking for part of their salary in bitcoins. This still pushes the point where someone will probably need to exchange them back but, if this processes continued, you may eventually reach the holy grail whereby bitcoins can flow from consumer to merchant to supplier and round again without the need for exchange.
The only time people would need to change back to fiat was when their tax bill arrived!
Without this cycle and the first steps in creating it, bitcoin might not reach the potential that many on here think it has

Asking a crowd to act a certain way is a fool's errand really. People will get greedy and scared at the same time, as a crowd. Nothing anyone says will stop them and the lengths of waves on a chart just indicate the size of the crowd participating relative to a given time frame. If bitcoin takes off this move will be seen as the start of the next bubble. If it dies it will be seen as the final bubble. 
One thing's for sure, if it does take off then the bubble on the left of the chart will seem very insignificant.

I'm in the UK and for larger sums I've transferred funds to MtGox but you'll probably be looking at a week for it to clear and you'll have to provide AML docs which will take another week (prior to your deposit).
I've not used Bitstamp but I believe you may not have to do AML and funds clear quicker.
Alternatively, I've taken to using localbitcoins.com in London. For 10k you may have to do 2 or 3 meets. PM me and I can let you know who I use as they've been trustworthy for me.
I also trade on there so can help you out but only for 15% of what you're looking for.
