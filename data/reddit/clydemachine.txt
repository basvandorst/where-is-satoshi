If you have multiple addresses stored in one wallet, you may have just had that one compromised. If you didn't send this transaction, then it was initiated by something else that had access to your private key(s). Consider all those addresses compromised, and move your coin to a safe wallet if you haven't already - off the machine.
As for why they left a balance in that and other addresses, I can't readily explain that. It's possible the hacker collects private keys and just pays for things using those compromised wallets, hoping the owner won't realize they've been hacked. But, this is a very strange and illogical approach, that I'm aware of.

Honestly, the best option is to hold your coins. Do not sell them back or you're guaranteeing your loss. When they go back up you'll be able to sell them or continue to hold them for a smaller loss or possibly even a profit if they rise up high enough.

Look at the Bitcoin trader/investor vs Bitcoin believer/investor difference, get their opinions and ask them if they agree with what the opposite is doing.

You are correct here. What you originally described isn't arbitrage, but daytrading.

@_date: 2013-04-10 20:42:46
There have been a few here and there, but the most notable that I can think of was a significant dip right around $150, when MtGox was last reported to be a victim of a sizable DDOS that produced this same event: huge lag on the site, huge sell-off, dirt cheap prices, then a massive showing of buyers returning to drive the price higher than before.

This is one reason I have no intentions of cashing out anytime soon. Keep in mind that as more publicity brings in more players to the market (with ever growing appetites for Bitcoins), there will be fewer coins to go around, and will help drive up the price. With there being a limited supply, this makes for a very strong case to hold Bitcoins long-term.

@_date: 2013-04-12 15:05:13
I don't think you understand what I'm saying. If a spread of $20 were to occur on an exchange, it wouldn't occur all at once. If the bid and ask were that far apart, that means that some users would be buying Bitcoins for $119 and others would be selling for $100. Users wont pay $119 if they can pay $100 on the same exchange right at that moment. The bid and ask are much close for that reason, plus so that the fees would overtake the spread's effectiveness for this kind of prodit-making opportunity.
Does that make sense for you? I'm trying to help as I'm not sure you are familiar with exchanges and daytrading, given your questions. I support you jumping in to experiment.

Your reply doesn't deserve those downvotes. I agree that the information he has leaked, from what I have gathered, isn't really telling us anything new beyond the fact that yes, there is a global scale to the surveillance. 
Americans live in the most powerful nation in the world - economically, politically, etc. To think we haven't had this kind of surveillance capability, or to think we haven't tried to have that kind of reach with our information gathering, is naive in the grandest sense.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:39:13
Do read the other threads and comments posted regarding the US government's level of interest in the Bitcoin. You'll find that Bitcoins are only worth hardly a drop in the many billions of USD floating around the world.
With that in mind, why would the US print up so much money just to erase that tiny blip, while devaluing their own currency in the process?
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:46:24
I'm afraid (from my inexperienced but curious and slightly educated view) there is no merit to this. MtGox may be the biggest exchange by volume, but it is by far not the only active exchange making moves in the market. If Bitcoin crashes, MtGox fails harder than it currently is - especially with the lagging orders, this will leave customers sore and looking to other places to do business.

I believe that is exactly what will happen. If posts here on reddit, for example, are any indication of the market's popular opinion, Bitcoins will undergo a huge Buy order influx after this sell-off is done, leaving prices to head right back up where they were yesterday, at minimum.
As for % wise, I do not know enough about the ForEx or economics in general to make that kind of speculation.

I agree that the USD will not live forever. 
But if the American government can't control the Bitcoin as a centralized currency, there's no way that they will adopt it as a standard of any kind - in other words, it'll never be adopted as a replacement for USD, even if the public of the world begins using it in their everyday transactions.

Google taught me a lot. If you search ForEx and basics of trading currency pairs, you'll learn a lot of useful information in understanding how to trade or at least properly invest in Bitcoins.
Technical indicators are very helpful - it's the difference between using a map and walking through a forest, vs saying that you don't need a map and you'll be fine on your own. Take the help that's out there - MACD, Stochastics RSI, and RSI are my favourite three to use. Google how to use them and you'll be much better off than without them.

USD can fail, BTC can fail. If the Bitcoin remains anywhere near as volatile as it has been in the past, whether recent or historic, where just media attention gets it jumping all over the chart, there's no way anyone will truly trust in investing their earnings in the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:03:34
Deciding not to take a huge risk is not a bad decision, it's a guaranteed safeguard against taking the loss from that risk. Money not made isn't money lost. Sure I could have bought a couple Bitcoins back in January or so, around $30USD, but I can guarantee I would have spent them long before now. This doesn't mean I've lost money. I missed an opportunity. Several, actually.
But do I really regret it? No. Thanks to jumping in when I have, I've become truly motivated to jump into Forex trading, and I've learned more about trends and charts and money in the last 5 days since my first major BTC purchase than I could have ever learned otherwise.
Things could have been done differently, but the fact stands that they happen the way they happen. Take risks or don't take risks, but stand by your decision and its merits.
Lucky for you, it's still not too late to make Bitcoin investing worthwhile for you. It won't be as exponential in the short-term as we just saw in the last week, but the fact is its still making daily gains, and those dealing in BTCs are the ones benefiting.

Bitfloor is a viable option for trying to trade BTCs in thus manner. It's quick, though no options for stop losses. You can set Limit Orders for buying or selling, but nothing specific for stop loss or take profit.

"They" are the perpetrators of the Denial of Service attack. As far as I can tell, they are coordinated in the way that it would take multiple machines to cause this much lag and service interruption for an exchange like MtGox, especially happening all at once. 
I cannot claim to know who "they" are specifically, but that's why this is just a theory. I do not know for fact, I am only sharing my thoughts that others might consider it and dispel it as they find fact.

Enthusiasm from buyers and fresh speculators, plus the Bitcoin being a deflationary currency. That's what comes to mind for me, and as far as I can tell $200 is no ceiling for its value.
I am not familiar with how Litecoin is created, and I'm sure they can create a larger supply of cryptocurrency, but if Litecoin is run off the same model as Bitcoin, their supply will also be fixed, and therefore will also be deflationary. Now, convincing users that Litecoin is something worth being as popular as Bitcoin, that's another story. As I've said, I am not familiar with what makes Litecoin different from Bitcoin - except that it is not Bitcoin.

This is a nice thought. But as you have said this counts on the price going up - but at an inconsistent rate. How might one account for this? I doubt businesses would offer products and services priced in this manner without some degree of certainty as to how much it'll rise by and when.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:04:18
I don't think you understand what I'm saying. If a spread of $20 were to occur on an exchange, it wouldn't occur all at once. If the bid and ask were that far apart, that means that some users would be buying Bitcoins for $119 and others would be selling for $100. Users wont pay $119 if they can pay $100 on the same exchange right at that moment. The bid and ask are much close for that reason, plus so that the fees would overtake the spread's effectiveness for this kind of prodit-making opportunity.
Does that make sense for you? I'm trying to help as I'm not sure you are familiar with exchanges and daytrading, given your questions. I support you jumping in to experiment.

@_date: 2013-04-10 20:31:50
Here's my take on it: purposeful DDOS to create significant but temporary dip in prices, to allow a major influx of fresh buy orders.
Long version:
It's becoming quickly apparent that someone (a group of someones) wanted to get in on Bitcoin price increases as we've seen in the last few weeks, but didn't buy in at that time (or, didn't buy in enough). Having seen just how high the price can go - reaching right around $250 before the sell-off - they orchestrate a DDOS and a huge sell-off, to force the price back down to a fraction of what it was worth just hours ago. I saw someone say this is the Wednesday 50% discount.
Once the attack and sell-off are done, they and everyone else buys Bitcoins like crazy at dirt-cheap prices. This is their second shot at huge monetary gains. They do this knowing full-well that the very activity of everyone under the sun placing Buy orders will drive the price back up near where it was, minus the involvement of now cautious investors who are feeling the burn of the recent dip. This attack creates a buying opportunity that investors and enthusiasts have been begging for since this ramp-up began. 
Everyone's looking to cash in on this Bitcoin rush, and I can't blame them. But it is clear why this is happening.
It's clear that this sell-off is not part of the normal market forces that have pushed the Bitcoin's value to the recent highpoint, it is price manipulation on a grand scale. Notice that only MtGox suffered the huge DDOS at first, then others apparently had trouble with lag and reportedly being down under traffic pressure. It's clear that MtGox was/is the target of this attack, and that it is working.

It's very easy to buy Bitcoins through Bitfloor, if there's a Bank of America near you. Just put in a deposit of USD on their site, they give you an account number. Fill out a deposit slip at Bank of America within a couple days, and you have the cash within a half hour, and Bitcoins moments later if you order them right then.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:07:43
In other words, MtGox is profiting from Bitcoin no matter how the currency fares. ;)

Not worried, myself, but I could really use a jog right now.
When these sorts of things happen I have lately been finding myself learning how to skateboard. I check the prices, see this kind of drop happening, then turn off my computer and get used to riding around and try to do some Ollie's without falling off.
Basically, I'm using this as a time to take a break from Bitcoin stuff to remain active and in some way productive. When it subsides, I've learned something and got some exercise.

The way I'm seeing it is the participants decide their exchange, the exchange tells them what other participants are buying/selling at. Hence, you and I are both correct in a sense.
Agreed on the point about MtGox being a woefully unreliable system to invest in Bitcoin, too. It pains me to see that others don't try other exchanges. I've heard a time or two a redditor asking about alternate exchanges for non-US residents, and that's where I see the most issue. I tend to recommend Bitfloor, but even then that's only valid for those with a Bank of America near them in the US.
At present, the more exchanges, the better.

Yes, that's simply buying low and selling high. That's the fundamentals of the profitable market.

The sad part of it is there are services dedicated to mitigating the effects of DDOS attacks - if that's what these are. If they're actually just all the buying and selling users/bots doing it, there's probably not a lot that the exchanges can do about it. 
But if it's actually just a LOIC-style attack, MtGox should have been able to do something more about it. And yes, I'm singling them out because they are the biggest and do not take the precautions that are necessary to hold that title.

As mentioned elsewhere, this is likely due to the bank's behaviour, not Coinbase's. It's noted in other posts of similar nature that if someone doesn't let their bank know ahead of time they'll be conducting larger-than-usual transactions with a particular business/website, their account gets suspended or flagged or whatever. 
I'd say you'd be better off doing that bombarding on the bank's support and see what they can tell you about your account.

I've been using Bitcoinium. It comes with a widget that draws data from an exchange you choose, and there are 8 or more listed. It also shows a simple price graph for the last few hours or so to give you an idea of where the price is at and where it has been since you last checked it.

Image repost with a guy's opinion surrounding it.
Still, he's correct in saying that the Bitcoin explosion this week behaved identical to that bubble chart. But look at the facts - that supposed "pop"? All it did was break the upward trend and drop it back to the previous day's value. Now it can't hardly touch 140USD without slipping back to somewhere above 130USD.
That's not a pop, but I suppose you could call it a correction of sorts. I prefer to think of it as the Bitcoin starting to stabilize at last after this parabolic business.

This, and SpongeBobMadeMeGay's comment about Bitfloor are the best two comments for getting started, as far as I'm concerned.
Get some cash (yes, cash) and get set up on Bitfloor. Then, once you've got some Bitcoins, hold them and learn what they are, and most importantly why they are what they are. Their value isn't coming from nowhere. Understand why they increase in price, why they decrease when it happens, and what they're ultimately meant for. 
This is not a stock. This is not virtual. This is digital currency, and as far as I'm concerned, this is a major part of our future.

THANK YOU! I was coming here to say the exact same thing. 
A couple things they got wrong right around the 3:30 mark until the end:
1. The Bitcoin protocol (and Bitcoins themselves) were not created by a company. They were made by programmers, by regular people.
2. 21 million is a cap. Can it be changed? No - the software is coded in such a way that mining continually gets infinitesimally closer to that 21000000th whole Bitcoin, but it will never realistically reach it.
This shows that the people in the interview (on both sides) do not understand how Bitcoins are made, and therefore do not understand the nature of Bitcoins.
