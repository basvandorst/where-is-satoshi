You can also buy bitcoins online using peer to peer services like Paxful.
It's like craigslist in that it lets buyers and sellers list their offers for bitcoin, you see one you like, start a trade and you are chatting with them live. 
Found some pretty cool traders who walked me through my first time. So far bought bitcoins with paypal, bank of america cash deposit a few times and western union. Now I even sell bitcoins. Once you start trading peer to peer and hustle a little bit you can do really well.
Check out my offers. 
Bitcoin is all about helping others and improving your life. A guy wrote a full walkthrough on how to get bitcoin and sell it.

good idea, wil join

good technical outline. pretty intense yet it looks just 3 or 4 pages. the good thing is that a dude in his dorm can still do a bitcoin startup so that gives me alot of hope that bitcoin won't ever go to the darkside.

@_date: 2015-06-22 21:43:58
yeah, couple of UK traders on paxful doing national bank transfers. 
fatguyslim is legit
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:28:24
Paxful is a peer to peer market so you trade direct with others. Some dudes, say Paypal dudes ask for Id, but bank cash deposit dudes and western union ones don't ask for anything except a receipt.

Circle is a solid company. I trust them for now. I buy there and sell p2p on paxful alot. I still even buy from coinbase once in a while. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:04:37
This is why I stick to peer to peer.
Feel free to hit me up on paxful and buy some bitcoins from me if there is a TDbank nearby. I also do ppmc sometimes.
all centralized exchanges will go down this road, they are forced to. Even the p2p ones will start feeling the heat soon. hopefully openbazaar starts a bitcoin currency trading app, but for now I'm pretty happy with Paxful, their developers actually listen to us.

They're deal with alot of shady characters there so they prob got spooked. but seriously there is no excuse for them holding your coins and not giving them back, especially if you are selling. I never keep to many coins on there if I can help it. Not an American company, they can do whatever they want. 
sucks, hope they release your coins.

go celery is small but it is my fav bitcoin brokerage now. good dudes running it!
celery i buy and then i sell on paxful = about a 6 figure salary for me for a few hours of work every week. not a bad side gig

The Uber of money will be startup that lets PEOPLE use their financial instruments and tools to earn much like uber lets them use their cars.
Bra does a great job of this yet, looking at their model how much can you really earn being a teller? It seems they control the payouts.
The one model that makes sense to me, because I’ve used it and made some good profit, is Paxful. It’s like Seamless or Uber of money in that it is a peer to peer market where you can buy and sell bitcoin.
Here is the amazing thing tho, even thought bitcoin seems central to it, it really isn’t. Bitcoin is just the global lubricant used to move value around between currencies and payment methods like amazon gift cards, bank accounts etc.. It works and I had a few offers on there for around 15-40% profit and I got a few trades.
made some good money and I am going to scale up , many others are doing so. check it out.

best thing is to let them buy some bitcoin. once they have it they can really see what it is about.
got my first $50 worth of btc from that dude via paypal.
then have them send it around. works better than any video
@_date: 2014-10-23 00:38:42
you see easybitz.com ?
they got a leaderboard and merchants auto bump to the top each time they take bitcoin. pretty slick. right track me thinks. these guys make videos too.
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:33:27
this should've been done months ago! what happened to you guys after that newsstand video? could to see u back, more vids please
you should organize bitcoin flash mobs to show the shops we mean business!
@_date: 2014-10-23 00:13:51
i spoke to the easybitz guys about decentralizing the whole thing.
they answered back fast and said they would love to but right now the goal was to get the whole thing tested and working so they could route enough business to each new merchant to make em "stick" they said.
makes sense. if it all works, when it works they said they would love to decentralize it.

buttcoin is back... or is it bitquick ?
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:58:00
lay off dude, makin alot of trades there and helpin' peeps. trollin' doesn't help anyone.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:55:02
good call. 
nyc ain't all that, lived in Corona Queens my whole life before moving to Asia, a hellva much better life in every way. nyc is way over rated.
Hong Kong, Tokyo, manilla, Bali Chang Mai... hell any city here beats there. and agreed we shouldn't be bangin on one dude like Lawsky. just makes us all look childish.
@_date: 2015-08-24 06:43:15
nigger_loaf is a class act alright.
just let him keep on going until everyone knows. always a couple of these in every bunch. he also accused me of being paxful.
i do sell there however! hit me up if u do neteller.
@_date: 2015-08-10 21:42:49
cool. good guys. I bet the same troll who jumped on the other thread will vote this one down.
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:35:06
good to see since these guys are getting actively brigaded hard
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:23:45

@_date: 2015-07-12 15:00:17
I sold coins to her. very sweet girl actually. should asked to see more pics ..lol
@_date: 2015-08-24 06:40:10
would be a welcome change from their nonstop terra smut
@_date: 2015-07-01 23:04:33
I prefer gocelery.com to coinbase, any day of the week.
Also now trade on paxful. they keep the scammers out and are alot easier for newbies.
