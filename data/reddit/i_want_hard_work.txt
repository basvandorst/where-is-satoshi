It's morons getting hyped about their overinflated currency/ego and then being shocked when someone realizes they're gullible enough to just hand millions of dollars over on the internet and cleans them out.
@_date: 2014-04-14 16:12:28
Wait, does not know it's a joke to everyone else?  It's almost as bad as @_date: 2014-04-14 16:13:36
And the Jamaican bobsled.  And the fact that the majority aren't arrogant, incorrigible douches.

You guys realize I was mocking you by posting this here, right?
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:50:51
Shhhh... your logic has no place here.
@_date: 2014-12-15 06:42:38
I'm pretty sure this joke is older than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:59:53
Please explain to me in plain terms what, if ANY advantage BTC has over the American dollar.
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:53:34
Wait, so it's stealing?
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:12:32
Ar go fuck yourself
@_date: 2014-04-14 16:14:09
420 crypto it 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:02:30
LOL... you people think BTC is the real deal and not another bubble.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:53:44
Yeah man I'm super ignorant for recognizing that the price chart follows the same pattern of every fucking bubble trend there is or ever will be.  The fact is, BTC is SUPER overvalued right now. If you don't understand that, you're in idiot.  You have "companies" springing up overnight that people are eagerly dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars into like MtGox.
Fuck if I was going to get into the game now there's no point in mining BTC.  The real money is in banking.  Notice any familiar patterns starting to emerge?
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:53:51
Thank you
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:26:17
Look in the mirror
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:13:49


Keep peddling those tulips, they're magic.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:03:40
Woah dude, BTC are totally different from stocks... somehow.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:12:23
How can our market cap be real if our currency isn't real?
@_date: 2014-12-26 05:00:24


@_date: 2014-04-14 21:14:58
But dude, didn't you know that putting your life savings in the hands of an exchange center around a trading card game is the best investment you could make? /s
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:18:19
The response directly above you is *exactly* why someone like myself would never be part of the Bitcoin community.  You guys (not OP in particular) take yourselves WAY too seriously.  For example, OP, why would you even want to talk about other cryptocurrency?  This sub is for SERIOUS BITCOIN DISCUSSION ONLY, conveniently ignoring the fact that your original post was about the contrast of the two communities and hence very related to Bitcoin.
It's almost like watching yeah you're not wrong but 90% of the time the community is still an asshole about it and do absolutely nothing to garner support.  I'm really glad you're all the sage prophets who are going to usher in the new age of digital currency, but you could be a little less pretentious about it.  This shit is on and coming in here I found the kinds of responses I expected.
That being said, confronting this problem has brought some very nice, honest, and realistic Bitcoin users into this thread so maybe some discussion WILL get done.  Of course this thread would never have come to light *without* the Dogecoin community so maybe that in itself is something to consider.
Much pretentiousness.  Such exclusivity.
@_date: 2015-05-02 23:21:55
Then why are you using Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:17:01
The Silkening.
@_date: 2014-04-14 16:15:01


Hahahahahahahahahahaha thank you.  That was the good bit of comedy I needed to start my day.
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:43:41
I just want to say I'm a huge fan.  You're demonstrating to these people what a brilliant 21st century heist looks like and why regulations are necesssary.  Take them for all they're worth.
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:04:46


@_date: 2015-02-07 17:46:43
OK, I'll bite because I'm insanely curious now: how exactly did you go about selling coffee to your coworkers?  Did you pick it up from Dunkin Donuts in the morning and then throw a "convenience fee" on top?  Did you buy coffee for the office coffeemaker and then ask everyone to chip in?
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:51:02










You should open a bakery that accepts Bitcoins
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:00:08
It's shit like this that makes me love my roommates.  Two are nursing students, another is a single mom, I'm a graduate student. Everyone has different hours so our policy of doing dishes is, "pile it on until someone gets to it."  It's mindblowing how well it has worked.  We honestly all take turns with it.  It's like this weird mini utopia.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:19:54
I know!  Someone explain to me why bitcoin is reliable but dogecoin isn't.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:29:18
That's a sound financial decision.  Let's see if it pays off.  I can imagine this conversation:
"What's our profit margin look like?"
"Uhhhh" *looks at current bc prices* "Ask me tomorrow?"
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:27:00
Bitcoin yesterday: $1000
Bitcoin today: $575
Watching all the bittards panic because they thought their enlightened cult was infallible: Priceless
*"There are some things only bitcoins can buy, like illegal drugs over the internet and hubris.  For everything else, there's Mastercard."*
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:05:37
nice try blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:28:36
Dollars are a fiat currency that's too untrustworthy.  Let's put all of our money into volatile digital numbers!  That will surely end well.  How a business decided to accept bitcoins is beyond me.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:17:44
Yeah.  So, my mentality about money is that I not only want it but I care very much about the manner in which I make it.  I enjoy being paid for doing something creative or giving back rather than purely get-rich-quick stuff.  So seeing people who have very minimal knowledge of this technology but assuming they can just jump in the game and be millionaires is amusing to me.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:45:20
Yes, that's the kind of currency I'm very interested in.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:28:57
Oh I don't doubt it will go back up.  People who actually know what they're doing are probably fine.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:13:36


Damn it, you beat me to it.  At least I already have dibs on "bittards".
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:42:49
Does no one remember the economist coming on here six months ago and comparing the bitcoin graph to the tulip AND 2008 graph?  No one ever wants to face overvaluation because we want the good times to roll.  But that's like drinking alcohol to stay drunk.  At some point you're going to come down with one hell of a hangover.
