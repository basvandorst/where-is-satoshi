How so? I missed that.

Yea well their business model turned out to be not profitable so they had to change something, and changetip didn't live to its hype unfortunately. The idea behind it is really good, but people are just people, and are not eager to tip that much.

Hey, you should've replied to to give the tip, but I forwarded it for you. Happy new year!

Or the A.I. that emerged and is living in the Internet.

It's a poor design really. You should hire a professional graphic designer to make one for you

Hey man, I just read your story for the first time and I'm genuinly happy for you. Yay reddit!

I was expecting a meh.. but her voice got me.

Serious question here. What should one do when tipped a Bitcoin on reddit? I'm still a newb in the Bitcoin subject trying to understand how to set up a wallet and this tipping is so confusing.. I mean where do the tip goes to in the first place before someone redeems it?

I don't work for them dude.

Well what if they make ISPs to shut down **connection** to the Internet? That's basically a shutdown for the people isn't it?
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:50:42
Sorry OP but it's really bad excuse for sharing a link to a torrent here. If someone wanted to use torrent to download a movie it's their call, you should've just use a link to imdb instead.
And also you're lying you don't use fiat anymore.

@_date: 2017-08-26 23:00:51
Yes, but ChangeTip failed and got shut down. So a restart?
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:02:51
Awesome, free BTC is always free BTC!

I feels ya, man. Bought BTC when they were at 600. Sold everything at 1200 in April just because I needed all the money I could find to pay for the mortgage.. But the payment due is in few days from now.. I could've just hodl for month longer and my financial situation could be much better :( I only sold 2.2 btc, but that was a lot for me. Still I profited 200%.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:54:31
Damn, that would be unfortunate.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:47:05
I'm in the same boat. Just sold it few weeks ago when it was at 1200 after a dip. I was not in need of money as of the time, I am just about in a few days from now to pay for the house. I figured it's the best time to sell as it can't go higher than that and I was afraid it will go down to 1000 again. I was so wrong...

Am I the only one that thinks it looks great?
