Yes, you are right but the current problem about fitting experiment data for your model or theory still here.
I meant its not the experiment data that count its it that fit an already made theory and sometimes to fit an agenda...
There is no doubt that there is a "crisis" in modern science, institution and method...

You really think so ? I looked a little bit, the whole concept especially the Gaz (what the fuck is the Gaz ?) just turn me off, I looked the splitting process (before the hack) of The DAO: what a cluster fuck !
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:44:27
Say whatever you want but we have virtually no choice for scaling (outside block size increases which is a band aid and doesn't solve long term scalability problem at all...)
BTW: I persist and sign that ETH/DAO is more complex than LN.
@_date: 2016-08-15 01:27:17
OK with side chains for big blocks as long Core protocol remains conservative and safe...
Side chains will solve those problems indeed.
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:51:41
You don't understand, blocksize issues and decentralization issues will happen with every fucking alts out there, alts people seems to not understand that fucking blockchain doesn't scale well especially if you want to keep decentralization and censorship resistance, alts don't have blocksize problem because nobody fucking use them ETH included...

With Classic we would had never such progress and an exciting future like that, changing a constant is very easy like they said, yes maybe but it's not making bitcoin better.
I think this is what they wanted:
1) A political coup.
2) Having more TPS for bubbling the price in July...
Only short term thinking, sad... (and I say that as a speculator who like riding bubble !).

Short sellers won't avoid another bubble in fact they will just get margin called thus pumping more the price !

Wrong, wrong and triple wrong !
Speculation IS free market !
Speculation is about predicting how the market will react in the future given some economic data (technical analysis, fundamentals, events and news).
It's a part of free market as simply buying and selling assets or goods.
When I buy oil future contracts, I really buy some stock of oil and hope that it will worth more in a few weeks or months by analyzing how the economy is or will be in the close future (consumption , sales, unemployment, etc, etc).
**Same shit with BTC, I speculate that more people will use it and buy it because they like it and it's useful and our ecosystem expend !**
You don't have economic education that's all I see...
Speculation is a natural part of markets, without that there is no markets: Eco 101.
Farmers speculate too they even buy future to hedge themselves or make extra profit !!!
Also you hate grain price bubble ? Then blame the Government and central banks who have done QE while pumping assets like no tomorrow !
So stop with your socialist rhetoric it doesn't work here, when you wait low price to buy your heating oil you are speculating and you are a speculator simple as that, every economic actor speculate !

In reality you could pump BTC price with a lot less money not 10^6 * 10^6 = 1 Trillion ( 10^12 ).
Actually with less than 1 billion per year, if nobody sell or rather HOLD, you could pump the price to 4000 or 10 000 easily and I don't even count the FOMO effect !

Bud, if we can spend it (massively on chain I must precise) and become centralized because of higher blocks it will be useless why using a blockhain ? it's just wasting resources better use a database.

2MB should be fine, in fact I heard about a maximum of 8MB without putting the network at risk (orphan, mining centralization, bandwidth, etc...)
Also LN require block increase too, so it's evident (at least for me) that we will not stay at 1MB forever, but other scaling solutions should be explored before.
For me raising the block size should be the last solution after when we tried everything. Why ? because it's very easy to change it (at least when we have large consensus.)

The good plan is to increase on 20 MB static, thus giving room and time to develop off-chains solutions.

Edit: LN won't stop you to use traditional BTC payment, LN is to scale up and allow thing like paying coffee or restaurant, in short everyday transactions and the ones that need to be instant. (like streamium.)
BTC system, on the other side will be used for large balance payment and storing your wealth long term (ie: you close all your channels, LN settle transactions on the chain and now you can stack your wealth in your paper wallet !).

Wrong again, it can be also in US friends countries such as Japan or Korea which still pose the same geopolitical risk.
One thing that you seem to not understand, is that Bitcoin to survive need to be decentralized as much as possible in the 192 or so jurisdictions of this world.
That meant miners in US, in Europe, in Africa, in Middle East, in Israel, in Iran, in Russia, in China and in Japan + hidden mining on Tor...
Shifting back to the US or US centric world is a no go.
Decentralization of jurisdictions is what it keep bitcoin censorship resistant and working.

I was OK and maybe many of us here with the 20 MB **static** limit and even the 32 MB one !
But not that **no limit exponential function** that some people push stealthy like that.

Does the final BIP to be implemented will be decided here ?
Edit: thanks for the answers.
@_date: 2015-12-16 18:49:03
No, I come from Supply/Demand equilibrium...
Today raising block-size at 10 MB will make fees going toward zero (supply excess demand).
But in the future as Bitcoin scale up the bullish pressure on fees will be here again finding a new equilibrium (Supply will be the same but more demand).
Unless you believe that BTC won't scale up in the future...
Let's face it today there is a bullish trend on fees with 1MB: it's more and more difficult to make a zero fees transaction and you have a high chance to get backlogged !
(Notice: I speak on fees in Bitcoin term not in dollar term).
Edit: I am not a BIP101 supporter who is far too aggressive, the BIP100 or 2-4-8 is more reasonable, I think we all agree that block-size need to be raised in the near future even if it's 2MB !

Women are fundamentally different than men even if genetics change over time it's very unlikely that men and women will become the same in the future.
Our own survival as a specie is based on those differences, things that feminist, mangina, White-Knight and gender SJW have a huge difficulty to grasp...
I don't have source on hand but now it have been proved by research (in neurology) that male brain and female brain is wired completely differently, which explain rationally why 95% of the bitcoin user are male.
(When it will be as easy to use BTC as you use Paypal, Skrill or a you average bank account, I expect a lot more female going in BTC so, it's Bullish, women spend far more than men too).

Yes, but not at the cost of decentralization of mining: 8 GB in the exponential function of Gavin's proposal is scary.

A final 200 or 300 MB should be enough to make things fluid.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:18:24
a) LNs are not here but some dev work on it now, this solution is taken seriously as way to scale very big.
b) An extremely worried user that may sell his stake (yeah the market will figure out what to do) if BTC become a centralized shithole because small node get dropped in mid air if they can't follow the big blocks gravy train...
c) !? I'm not sure to understand... but a hard capped limit is always welcome (we are sure that blocks aren't going more than X so we can hedge accordingly) than a no limit proposal...
Also block increase is just a band aid that it solve nothing fundamentally.

@_date: 2015-06-04 01:12:43
Lightning Networks can't create money, they lock coins on the chain before making transactions in a channel. When the channel is closed the last transaction is then settled on the chain.
No fake bitcoin are exchanged here.
Even with sidechains, when you go to an alt-chain, BTC are locked before the transfer.
Your legitimate worries about fractional reserve will only work with centralized services such as Coinbase.

1) Choosing a channel via some kind of database, IP address, onion website or better some kind of hashed address like BTC address ?
2) Opening a channel with an hub or your payee.
3) Sending coins through LN.
4) Payee get paid and receive in his wallet.
5) Then one of the party decide to:
a) Keep them in the channel (channel remain open) for eventual future payment.
b) Settle it on the chain and thus closing the channel.
More complicated variant can be done: things like A pay C through B all done "trustlessly".
If a node goes south then it's settled automatically after a period of time.
Possibility of a very great number of nodes thus keeping the network decentralized against malicious entities.

You should be realist: Bitcoin will be not a payment system, I used to believe that too (and even at that time I was not entirely convinced).
Decentralized payment system doesn't scale well, we should recognize that. The vast majority of transactions will be on layer 2 solutions (LNs, sidechains, treechains, etc...).
That said I agree a bump to 2 MB is needed ASAP maybe after SW deployment, but raising the block size is not the scaling solution, just a thing to buy up some time...
@_date: 2015-06-04 08:43:55
Well, I know there is not so many women in BTC, but here it's not like doing programming or math, using a wallet is at an accessibility level that anyone can use it, especially a mobile phone one...

It never existed aside very rare example (ie: Kibbutz)


Your so called social democracy are collapsing upon high taxes, debt, goverment malinvestment, rampant poverty, massive immigration and purchasing power collapsing (despite how great socialism is working according to you... s/), people who flee and take their business elsewhere (and I don't speak about big corps here but medium small too).
As for US they still do pretty well despite getting more and more socialist with years going on. But don't worry it head the way of Venezuela a nation where businesses are destroyed upon big gov spending, meanwhile sitting on one of the largest oil reserve of the world just behind Saudi Arabia !


If you can put your head out of the sand and stop believing in socialist/leftist fairytales maybe you can continue this convo with me, but I fear not thus it's better that I finally buy you (with my capitalist earnings) a one way ticket to Venezuela and experiment your wonderful ideology out there :)

It's clear... If it worked you don't need to enforce it by the state (via illegitimate violence) !
About property rights and violence:
Violence is legitimate when someone is violent with you or try to take away your property, money, etc.
You seems confused with legitimate violence and illegitimate one.
Violence is legitimate when someone is trying to harm you or your interest, in socialism this violence is illegitimate since it's violence that try to harm you or your interests.
Once again, you really seems confused about those two concepts.

State are in heavy debt and at the verge of collapsing with their unsustainable welfare state model (due to the ponzi nature of it and demographic change) so Statist want to "tax the rich" to mask their incompetence at managing public finance while giving to the general population "that they are doing something"...
Most of the country listed here are either low tax "tax haven" or in majority countries that are the verge of bankruptcy, so the only one things that politician are good at, is to steal money from people via taxes: it's not new.
Note that some countries like Panama doesn't participate in the program.
I wonder how it works with Trust and foundation since the beneficial owner is hidden or even sometimes no official beneficial owner !
Of course Bullish for BTC, let's implement a zero-coin like protocol to make it more anonymous.
EDIT: On the other side it's also a good things, why ? It will be obviously harder for rich people to hide their asset so what they will do ? They will move to lower tax countries in mass (it's already happening since several years in my county France !). It's perfectly legal to take your wealth, wife and children and move on. The obvious result will be more competition across Nation-State and all the one with their socialist heavy tax model will collapse due to the ever shrinking tax base ! Middle class will get crushed with tax and will demand more tax on the upper middle class as the part of "social justice", the the upper one will eventually disappear or flee, do you see the point ?
Interesting times indeed.

On the other hand capitalism or free market doesn't need the state to survive it's just free people deciding the best opportunities and trade for themselves.

Just a question:
Does the *new proposed* 20MB limit is good enough to make lightning networks work without problems ?
Pure speculation here but 20MB is 140 tps (Paypal scale), that give around max 1 TB per year of blockchain (which is still manageable to small nodes and miners and keeping BTC decentralized).
Speculating that lightning networks allow 100 times more transaction, which give 14000 tps max (more than the average visa scale) !
If this projection is right, it would be killer app for Bitcoin here.

Let the banks fail (like any business) with poor business plan or doing shit around. A functioning capitalist economy should works like that.
Ideally in case of bankrupt:
1) No fractional reserve, deposit are 100 % protected (if possible with real stuff such as gold.)
2) Then lender (those who have bank's bonds) are reimbursed.
3) Then (if there is any sufficient funds), the last wage of employees being paid and eventually a compensation plan (can be 2 or 3 months of the last wage).
4) Then (if there is any sufficient funds) shareholder. (Remember stock investor bear the full risk of loss). Today we tend bail-out those shareholder which render them "riskless".
5) The bankrupt can be avoided if a concurrent buy the company and eventually restructure it.
6) Ideally separation of deposit/lending activities and investment/speculation activities is the way to go.

You assume that it needs 3600 coins per day dumped to run all those miners cost which is not. 
Miners don't dump so much coins and when it become unprofitable at current price, they shut down at least for a short period of time.

20 MB blocks vs size in GBs or worse infinite one is not the same things.
In one case the decentralization will be keep, the other will become with only a few server farms around the world. Bitcoin wasn't to be centralized in the first place, it's that kind of things (pushing huge blocks and step functions that will centralize it).

Well, I haven't took side since that debate started but I will share my opinion here:
I'm in favor of the 20 MB new limit but no more than that after, it's clear that 1 MB is too low but increasing the limit should be not an excuse to the scalability problem that Bitcoin face.
This is just for buying us some time then after that, side-chains, off-chain transactions (for the cup of coffee) and lightning networks must investigated ASAP.
Ever increasing the block size is not a solution, especially if it cost us decentralization.

Riba is about to forbid to **lend things** and getting reimbursed later with the **same things plus interest.**
Buying something and selling it for later is allowed: it's called profit and ain't Riba.
For trying to clarify the things:
So, lending 10$ and getting reimbursed later 11$ is forbidden.
But buying Bitcoin 100$ then selling it back 110$ is allowed (at free market).
Selling something that you don't have is forbidden (naked short selling).
But I assume (I'm not a specialist nor Muslim) that lending a thing 0% and selling it, then buying it back for P/L is allowed...
Also Islamic principle are widely interpreted (from the most radical to the most progressive: a word in Arabic can have a dozen of different signification ! ) like all religions and principles some peoples may play with it to suit their needs, Islam is not a monolithic religion contrary to the popular belief.

And having GB block size in a few years this further centralizing mining and nodes...
**20MB or even the 133 MB static for lighting networks to perform at world wide scale is OK**, but 20MB +40 % per year equal 16 GB per block after 20 years growth. (exponential functions are bitchy).
Yeah try to transfer 16 GB (or even 1GB block) with your home connection in 10 minutes. Only big centralized data-center will be able to do that which they will be perfect target for hostile entities and Governments.
The scalability must be not done by increasing the block size infinitely but by side-chains and lightning networks solution alike which preserve decentralization and censorship resistance.
*Now ready to get downvoted into oblivion coz I don't follow the sheeple and going mainstream, but I warn you: uncontrollable or very huge block size will lead to centralization and ultimately put Bitcoin at risk.*

No, If I increase block more centralization will occur, I try to sync on my PC since three day (I don't let my computer running at night).
It will be more difficult to run full node if we have too much big blocks, node will disappear.
I use Bitcoin because I believed that "rules" were set in stone and not so easily changed by some random mob rule on reddit, also I think bitcoin will be a settlement layer, it's delusional to think that all transactions will happen on chain or that we will have 32 MB (or higher) blocks soon, it will take years.
For the Chinese miners Core can always change the PoW (nuclear option I admit it) so I don't worry about centralization of the miners so much, also many of those "miners" are pools: **individual people** can leave pools.
Also do you run a node or have a wallet (be it Core, Classic, XT or whatever) ?

Not at all, it come from how the consumer (or rather the buyer) perceive that value (being useful, scarce, doesn't degrade too much by time, can be displaced from A to B without too much hassle, it's nice and beautiful, my wife/GF love it ~~and will give me a lot of sex in return~~ and so on...) and the very desire to buy it at a specific price on the free market.

1) When I said "you" it was about your camp (The XT, Classic, whatsoever one)...
2) "You were" was about your camp too.
3) Do you run a node ?
4) Then the "power of people who run software" choose Core again, your fork was just a power play (even u/Forkiusmaximus admitted that it was a power Grab and not the block size debate anymore.)
5) Your team apparently tricked Chinese pools and miners when you told them it was a simple softfork at 2 MB, you lost their support after that (see thread around here).

That said it seems that we have more and more conses around 2 MB but not consensus around the Classic implementation, the miners want 2 MB but by Core...
I've raised in a topic that if we keep increase the blocksize, full nodes (who are indispensable for the network security) would need to be "incentivised" and get paid to handle the pressure. Satoshi forget the Full nodes in his prediction.

@_date: 2015-05-28 19:03:51
No, we don't know if they need to spend those 3600 coins daily to run all that.
BTW, if I follow your math:
900 Bitcoins are created daily. (After two halving days).
900 Bitcoins*240 = $216,000
There are ~105,000 transactions a day.
$216,000 / 105,000 = $2.05 per transaction. 
Alternatively a BTC price of $1000 give (with 900 coins per day) $8.57 or $34.28 for a 3600 daily supply...
It seems that the transaction fees reduce as further the coins reward is diminishing thus invalidating your argument in the first place.
Also you calculate in dollar terms: having a bitcoin price of zero give free transactions in your model...
We also simply don't know how the market will react in the future you are just doing projection. That kind of analysis require precise models and not some simple division on how much coins are created by the number of transactions.
Now I stop here because it start to become circular (and weirdly avoided my previous arguments as well).

I believed BTC to be such a system till now...
You know, right now, I am extremely confused, guess I will wait and see from now...
Also, for running a Node you just have to download Bitcoin Core on your computer right ? I never thought about that till now...

I'm for a moderate tax: a flat tax with no more than let's say 20 % of your annual income no matter your income is largely sufficient to run government services.
Now for representation voting yourself where the funds of your taxes will go will be a good start.
For example I am allocating my taxes to a fund that will build that new highway to go in Holidays in the South...
Now for the Hospital and Health service: Charities, Churches, association, and private assurances exist, making your argument void.

We don't spend less per se, but we spend better (we don't buy useless shit to replace every two years or even year) in an deflationary system. It's a plus from an environmental perspective also.
The problem also is that our economy is based on 70% consumption this is simply too much.

Users should probably educate themselves better.
Also devs tend to check each other indeed, let's say that an "Evil" dev want to destroy fungibility of BTC, he will be called out and NACK'ed.
Also I think some "rules" should be set in stone, when I saw that the 21 millions cap or the decentralization was submitted to a vote in Classic it just raised a big red flag in me.
No to the full control of Core but no to the democratic mob rule of Classic, finally I agree that the censorship of Theymos gone a little too far but the fake accounts and numerous Trolls around here made that solution unavoidable at least temporary.
For the Block-size it will be raised (moderately) but later: efficiency in block propagation must be made before raising the blocks, when everything will be ready (SW, IBLT, weak blocks) I will be the first to call out a block increase (probably the 2-4-8 plan).
Rushing things is the worst thing to do :)

Wrong in US each year people vote for the same clowns.
Secundo, Bitcoin is not democracy: there is rules who are set in stone (like the 21 millions cap) also decentralization must be preserved at all cost even if it meant to refuse big blocks increases.

It's far more easier to scale in a centralized systems a simple data base will do it.

Look at the decentralization vote: the mob rule decide that decentralization is not so important (maybe for scaling reasons).
[Look look: It's very instructive !](
Bitcoin Classic is **Bitcoin Mob Rule**, it's the end of bitcoin: **one day when the masses will come to vote they will want to remove the 21 millions cap because some charismatic "leader" will say so and the masses will follow it !**
Bitcoin failed into **democracy and politics the rule aren't set in stone anymore !**
**Beware anything can happen from now** and I think it's a dangerous precedent that happening here.
Sorry I was for the 2 MB bump and even the 2-4-8 but the new governance method is dangerous or flawed at best ! I seriously lost trust in BTC system, maybe Core should consider starting an Alt (if Classic win the Coup d'Etat) **with the rule set in stone**, I would buy it and mine it !

BU and centralist aren't fine, not even with SW + 2 MB it's just a power trip and a centralization attempt.

You got it completely backward:
1) Then follow the rule Bitcoin is Gold standard.
2) You can say everything with Satoshi Words, much like you can say everything by using Coran or Bible Verse from "kill all the infidels" to "don't disturb our community", to "everyone is welcome !").
3) The value of money is dependent of the scarcity of it and how much people want it ! Then what is the point of a centralized VISA payment system ? Or a bitcoin that can change "rules" to mob rule wishes ? 
If you think that bitcoin will handle all the coffees of the world on chain you are delusional at best.
Also Bitcoin have no value as a legacy system, PAYPAL and VISA work fine.

Please spar me your long tirade: intelligent people know better when it come to technical stuff.
Also, I have no interest in democracy, sorry only in a stable, immutable, decentralized, censorship resistant transaction system, I have zero interest in another VISA or PAYPAL, I am fine with the former...
I have zero interest in a system that can be easily changed by the will of mob rule and the masses...
Once again what happen if we go mainstream on the masses want to remove the 21 millions cap or create an algorithm to create "inflation" ?
No, bitcoin should be an immutable base layer protocol that can't be changed like that !
You big "scaler" are ready to throw those principle just for... scaling and earn more money just admit it.

There is evidence as list of wallet exchange and so on listed on Core website signaling they are ready to move toward progress !
nodes can be faked yes, but you can see easily fake node and organic adoption.
Fake node were like classic or XT who spin off from nowhere, here its 0.12.1 Core nodes upgrading to 0.13.1+
Wallet supporting meant that devs are implementing the code, user can opt-in to use it (old transactions are valid as SW is opt-in)
So your arguments are Null and Void.

Then it's very good, it just prove that making an HF is very difficult especially contentious one, the fact that it's extremely difficult to change for even a simple block raise make me trust in the system, system that can change easily are inherently unstable and unsure like... democracy who can change radically every 4 or 5 years.
See US election: from a black democrat president that a majority liked him to a white republican who promise to ban Muslim from US...
We call that political instability one flaw in any liberal democracy !

Correct, but actually technology can't handle block that large without compromising decentralization, actually it would be a miracle if we keep decentralized (and the same node count !) at 8 MB.
That's why we need better efficiency at broadcasting and processing the blocks, the only thing that the Core road-map is able to do !
@_date: 2015-05-16 19:09:31

I am not so sure, some in the "alts client " just want a power grab not the just raise the 2 MB anymore, in this this sense they are hostile, I also agree that Mob Rule is the worst for Bitcoin and they will be never be happy (even after concession) it will never stop people when in group to have group thinking and childish personality.
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:04:26

Your new governance method is based on mob rule instead of technical discussion. Also you were the first to **politicize** the debate **even some of your camp speak about a power grab** (it's not even about the block size anymore). You got tricked, especially by Mike Hearn and his FUD :)

That said I agree with the 2 MB proposal not for the power Grab of Classic but to give us some room too.
For me the Blocksize increase is just a band aid not a real scaling solution.
The micro transaction that speak about would be on things like LN or a side chain with fast confirmation and bigger blocks (some kind of pegged litecoin).
We could even peg the original Litecoin on BTC chain.

What I see in "Classic" (what an Orwellian word !) is no more than mob rule who want new things because it's "trending" and "cool" you are all emotional about overthrowing the "evil" core...
Core had a road map and published it anyone with half a brain could read/understand it.

I agree, but I would prefer that users set up their own nodes or those nodes aren't from those control freaks that we call Coinbase.
Fortunately we can do that with LN even having LN node on Tor as hidden service, maybe some kind of Trustless Banks service could be made:
You invest your liquidity in that "Bank" but that "Bank" can't seize or steal your funds because of the LN protocol.

Big block argument: The fee are tooooooo high !!!!!!!!!!!
Serious argument against it:
1) Have 1 MB block size, get a fee pressure of 100 satoshi/byte.
2) Then increase to 2MB, block get half full fee goes down to 0-10 satoshi for some time.
3) Then some spammer or on-chain coffee spender pull out free low cost transactions again.
4) OMG !!!! 2 MB block are full again !
5) Fee pressure up again 100 satoshi !
6) Big-blokers ask 4 MB (or exp function with warp drive included...)
7) Start the loop again. (recursively if possible).
**8) If you are wise, you will understand that a fee market will be ALWAYS here and that ANY increase in the blocksize will make them FULL because it's CHEAP to FILL them, capiche ?**

Blockzise limit have another function: it prevent that only big centralized actors control everything, you seems to not understand that BTC need to be **censorship resistant** and thus **decentralized and going toward MORE decentralization to worth something.**
All your little theories doesn't change this fact !
You want to do trade-off, **less security** for more scaling, **more centralization pressure** for more scaling.
This is all about scaling, scaling and scaling without watching the consequences I am glad that your are not in charge of the project...
Maybe you should sell and go ETH, they are all about on-chain scaling (but haven't found solution too) and smart contract on-chain, which end up with a things full of exploits and a very possible scam with full of exploits (the DAO).
Please stop messing Bitcoin and propose **unacceptable trade-off** this is what your "camp" basically doing, **lowering security and censorship resistance for MOAR scaling.**

Who created those "logical fallacy" I just see some brain masturbating to avoid dealing with reality...
Those so called "logical fallacy" are just things that academics use to close the debate and feel intelligent. Much like in TV debate (that I don't watch anymore) "you've got a Godwin point, now GTFO you lost, end of debate... "
Anyway, I don't care.
For example with your beer, many people slip into addiction maybe not heroine one but alcohol addiction ! So yes the slippery slope is real.
I come from real world (not brain masturbation one) and I know that people tend to want more and more and push things more and more far.
So it's not a slippery slope "fallacy" to say that once we rich 2 MB will ask 4, 8 and so on, especially if this was done on a political basis.
You see ETH will HF soon, they are setting a precedent that one day a Gov will ask them to freeze an unpopular address, no amount of "slippery slope fallacy" will avoid that, sorry to disappointing you.
Funny things: the slippery slope fallacy could be true here of people were reasonable (ie: not going too far or abusing) unfortunately real world events remind me everyday that's it's not the case at all...
**Now, how about doping that because I will not change and I will not change too so it become sterile here.**

FACT: we can't play the sorcerer's apprentice with a 12 Billions economic system...
* BTC will be more a settlement network now with the payment system on secure Layer II solutions and sidechains like OP said.
* Actuality Bitcoin is like Gold.
* Blocksize will be probably raised in the future after all improvement in protocol level will be made (probably the 2-4-8 solution).
* Block size must have an upper fixed limit even if it's an adaptive limit, this to prevent blocksize attacks and put pressure on small miners and nodes.
* LN/TN will do the low value fast secure payment network part of bitcoin, it will be decentralized.
* Sidechain will allow everything you want without risking messing up the main protocol: Classic, BU, XT, 8 GB blocks, blocks every 30 seconds, etc, etc...
* Rootstock or similar things will allow to have smart contracts and stock market exchange pegged to BTC (The DAO on sterroid).
Yes, the development may appear slow for the general user but in reality it's very seldom that we see so much release and development in any industry especially that most people like Core devs and LN devs work for FREE !
BTW, the ETH blockchain will be bloated and huge centralized pressure will appear, in the end why use a blockchain instead of a database ?
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:48:04

**Copy of the deleted article for posteriority.**
A Call For Core Developers to Clarify Their Stance on 2MB Hard Fork
Before we dive into it, please be reminded that this piece of writing is an effort to improve understanding and engage in discourse in an open, candid and transparent fashion.
This is no veiled threat, neither is it moral grandstanding.
Use of inflammatory language, argumentum ad passions, FUD, or downright character assassination will be out of the question, as they will only be counterproductive to the aforementioned purpose.
We will try to stick to basic facts that are clear and least controversial thus hopefully steer clear speculation as to one’s motives. If you take issue with the veracity of what we believe are facts, we are happy to discuss.
With the tone of this piece thus having established, let’s start with a brief recap of the events that eventually led to this:
In December last year, amid the heat and noise of the blocksize debate, representatives from both the Bitcoin Core developer community and the industry at large, including some executives of BTC companies and some large miners (the majority of whom, by coincidence, are geographically based in China) met in Hong Kong at the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop and subsequently, the first Bitcoin Roundtable conference. At the second of the two events, on Feb 21 this year, an agreement was reached and signed by the attendees including both Core developers and industry insiders — this document, published online, came to be known as the Hong Kong Consensus.
The reaching of such an agreement is a significant event and is widely perceived a positive development, especially given a new round of skepticism and criticism set off by the rage quit of former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn. Now with the Consensus signed, criticisms, such as Bitcoin has a fundamental and irremediable governance issue and that the Bitcoin community is at a civil war with itself with two camps dueling each other to death, were put at bay, at least temporarily. One may even argue that it serves to rekindle hope by showing Bitcoiners that in a time of crisis, the community are willing to discard their differences, and make compromises when greater good is at stake.
In this Consensus document, one part stands out:
We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.
This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.
Many perceive this as the outcome of the political arm wrestling between the Chinese miners and Core developers. The developers, in order to secure the support of the vast majority of hash power, strategiclly promised the miners 2mb hard fork. The miners, leveraging their hardware assets, had a chance to express their demand face to face to the developers and even had the later make a promise in written form.
There is no doubt that the 2mb hard fork is important in this document, actually if people were not serious about it, they wouldn’t have taken the trouble to assign a deadline to it:
The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.
Now with June approaching its end and June a few days away, there has been increasing concern whether the Core devs are ready to deliver on their promise, or any effort have been made during the past months towards this end. Some may feel compelled to ask: Were the Core devs who signed the document sincere in their promise or just squeezing the situation for all it’s worth?
Whatever the answer is, the Chinese community present at the Roundtable and signed on the Consensus saw the 2MB hard fork as a key negotiating point and something important to their interest. Today, this stance hasn’t changed.
Arguments were sometimes made that the Chinese didn’t hold up their end of the bargain — for instance, some mining pools gave users the option to mine Classic blocks — which was seen as a breach by some; however, this doesn’t negate the fact that people like HaoBTC made a strenous effort in fending off criticism from Chinese Classic supporters and Blockstream conspiracy theorists.
Diminishing the importance of mining in the Bitcoin economy, or calling the Chinese miners as whole corrupt and detrimental to decentralization is not a valid argument for its obvious falsity, not to say that it is not helping solve the issue — some of the Chinese attendees, such as HaoBTC, are heavily involved in mining, but are also run other services such as exchanges and wallets. Today, few would doubt that the Chinese bitcoiners account for a significant chunk of the economy and a legitimate constitution of the Bitcoin political system.
While we are under no illusion that the Consensus is a binding, enforceable legally enforceable document, we see it at least an authentic expression of the intensions of parties involved — If things have moved on to a point that some signatories now feel they have to reconsider or rescind their positions, it would be fair that they make public anouncement to such effect so the rest are aware of such developments and take actions accordingly. It would be disingenuous and unfair to keep others in the dark. As a signatory of the agreement, we (HaoBTC ) are interested in hearing any comments from the Core devs, especially those that signed on the document, regarding the current status of affairs.
Thanks and Best regards,
The HaoBTC Team

So what the matter ?
No limit = attack vector with malicious actors or big miners filling block with shit and then creating virtually any kind of block size and telling "kindly" to nodes and smaller players GTFO.

1) So you advocate more centralization because mining is centralized ?
2) Worse you insinuate that centralization is unavoidable so we must let it for the sake of scaling ?
3) If your "competing" parties that keep nodes are Coinbase, Xapo, Finex and some other exchanges Bitcoin is dead time to sell and move on...
4) Off-chain are decentralized see LN (it will even help to obfuscate transactions), sure if by off-chain you meant Coinbase then we are dead...
5) That kind of opinion of yours make me want to sell ASAP (but fortunately it's a minority opinion, my God :)

Well, I already see some derivative that for example you buy bitcoin under market price and in exchange you time lock them up before you can move them again !

You advocate essentially no limit...
Opening an attack vector about no upper bound of the block size.
The no limit scheme (even in the dynamic block size system) will put too much pressure on small noders, unbound block size create centralization pressure and a new attack vector.

1) Spammer will have fun.
2) Coffee transactions will fill block again.
3) Fees goes up again...
4) You troll again saying block and fees are full and high respectively.

No, a chain that have only miners and big businesses as nodes is insecure no matter the hashrate since they are keep them in check with myriad of nodes that BTC currently have.
It meant they can steal bitcoins, change the supply, etc, since you trust them !

You conspiracy theory could become a conspiracy fact, it's not exaggerated at all (unlike some conspiracies against Blockstream).

The only viable solution is then:

Neither the one who have 90% hashpower and just a few nodes to keep it in check...
The 10 % one would be more secure since it have a diversity of nodes. And like another writer said the more you wait in confirmation time the more it would be difficult to 51 % attack it...
Checkpoints could help too even if it's a temporally centralized solution.
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:35:08

Are you realizing that you advocate me to go from trustless to trusted models the exact problem that got me interested in bitcoin in the first place ? o.O
When it will be centralized in data centers, govs can do anything they want including depriving your BTC...
Try harder, you haven't convinced me at all quite the contrary...
You know ? PBOC is already probing exchanges, next step: probing centralized BTC data centers and ask to censor transactions...
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:44:05
No, since it have a lot of nodes with it ! Also it can either change PoW and difficulty down... New miners will arise and secure it back, messy yes, totally unrecoverable ? No.
Also if the majority chain attack it, it will just who their criminal behavior trust would be lost and the miners massively engaging in such attacks could face prison time...

Because they are there customers or got bribed like that pool in India ?
Jihan is playing a game: creating fake pools to show some organic adoption of BU and supporting the old Core client in Antpool at the same time.
This is to not show that he is the mastermind behind that attack (yes it's an attack !).
That guy play both side and now I even suspect him to further centralize mining Via BU for controlling BTC.

Sorry but that doesn't add up you cant force anyone, they will not lost their rewards since they will split, their reward will get accepted by the other chains, you can't avoid a split...
Also core could release some code to kill the "synthetic fork" if it was true...
It's the nature of BTC.
If I mine a Core block get a Core reward and get accepted by Core nodes and sell in a Core supporting exchange it's done the chain still alive and kicking.

No, their point is to fire Core devs and take over bitcoin development (and mess up everything in bonus...)


Things need to be done safely not rushing them (nodes upgrading problems).


User growth ?


Bitcoin need fees not only to secure its hash-power but to avoid block withholding attack by miners themselves...


Chart prove you wrong, also if only big busineses can run nodes better to consider the project dead, to be censorship resistant any average Joe should be able to run a full node if he want...




An altcoin that can surpass the badly designed and insecure big block Roger Ver's coin... It will be fun indeed.

That's why more bigger blocks = more users = more nodes and more decentralized miners isn't true at all...
The average Joe or worse the average Jane will never spin up full nodes, they will just use SPV, mobile wallet and blockchain.info or Coinbase...

Not at all, Gold started to become money thousand years ago it was slow and troublesome, you used to go around literary with physical coins and bullion to make your payment, the throughput was low (equivalent of bitcoin first layer today) also since it was scarce it became a store of value too...
Then, merchant and businessmen created "banks" who basically keep the gold in vault and give paper notes it was some kind of IOU fully exchangeable for Gold (it's the future layer two solutions (LN))...
The whole difference is that BTC is decentralized and fractional reserve unfriendly.
We all know that bankster started to make fractional reserve soon after being in charge of emitting IOU, a thing that you can't do in LN.
So no, it prove my full point, sorry for you :)

Once again I had right, it's months that I said that RV and the mining cartels want a PayPal coin...
Now we have conformation of that from RV himself.
No, Roger we don't sacrifice decentralization for mooning the price because unlike you and your laquais we know that Bitcoin have no purpose outside decentralized censorship resistant digital gold.
USE THE REAL THING ! PAYPAL !!!
It work faster and the interface is more n00b convenient, the draw back is that you can get censored (you who dislike censorship so bad) anytime they want and gov watch everything... (you should dislike that as a fucking libertarian).
BTC is useless as PayPal 2.0.
And no ! You won't decentralize again with bitcoin 3.0 once it's centralized, it's Game Over, trust will be lost and cartels and government will had captured BTC already.

You block it for political reasons, nothing more !
You said it yourself you block it because we don't want raise the block size right away.

No, Eve rely and validate blocks that agree with her rules...
Let's say that tomorrow 60 % of miners mine 2 MB, nodes stay 1 MB, those 60 % get orphaned (even if Alice and Bob mine together) while the 40 % still on the correct chain...
Those 60 % either need to split with new nodes and a checkpoint or mine back 1 MB blocks, also you fail to understand that a minority chain can survive here.

@_date: 2016-11-17 19:58:19


Not an argument.
1) Trade off is risking decentralization, censorship resistance and others things such security, transaction malleability...
Only Greedy people and mooning boys doesn't care about that...
2) The new block structure is for fixing some flaw such as malleability, while favoring a more compact way to sign transaction and many other improvements that need SW including LN).
On chain isn't a solution just a kick can down the road, it virtually change nothing as the scale is linear and risk are hugely increased...
The only argument for an on-chain scaling is for a 2 MB bump for giving more room time for LN to come around, keep in mind block will be always full as the demand is infinite as the price tend to zero.
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:28:23

@_date: 2016-11-12 18:05:29
Maybe some coin will be useful in the future, but what I meant is that BTC will be probably "number one" for a long time.

A few day ago I crossed upon one topic on the top, it was about a mod of r/btc being accused of censorship because he removed a spam topic...
One commenter, even engaged another one accusing him to be pro small block because he was against removing that mod of r/btc while that same person run a BU node signaling 100 MB !!!
When I read the message of the guy accusing the other one to be a small blocker, I had the impression to read a 16 years old...
The future of the money and 11 billions ecosystem in the hand of 16 years old, sound like a big short opportunity here :)

Bitcoin is taking a path that will lead to centralization, time to move and tell people that bitcoin isn't the safe haven that everyone speak out.
Anonymity and censorship resistance is the last things they care.

Well good for you, if you still worry about future block-size increases Core have no plan to stay 1 MB forever: the 2-4-8 plan (sized back to SW which give a 2-4 MB for the non SW part of the block) or maybe some kind of Flexcap (even if don't support unlimited block) will be implemented after efficiency of throughput is increased.

Jesus you understood nothing, I am out...
You can transact but on another chain since your chain will have different rules.
Eve protect herself by enforcing the rules she agree with indeed but she keep a local copy of the blockhain and help other nodes to keep their own copy too and verify the blockchain abide those rules.
I couldn't care less that you don't need Eve since you would be on an alt chain at this point !
Eve is needed, she protect herself but other too against evil miners !
For a gazillion time if you don't have "Eve nodes" your chain is insecure since it would be fully in the hands of miners, how difficult to grasp that seriously, Jesus Christ !

I draw the line when the proposals threaten the libertarian nature, censorship resistant, decentralized and low entry barriers (for running a full node).
Incompatible implementations must be kicked out period, all I see is a Roger Ver coin and big business coin here, I won't participate in this insanity !
It's a war between cyberpunk and libertarians against big businesses and big pockets centralized version of bitcoin.
The decentralization of implementations is pure shit and doublespeak, meanwhile mining is centralized in China as ever, big businesses make their law (coinbase, bitmain and so on).
The big miners, the Roger Ver, the Coinbase are the same as the old boss here.
So either there will be a split or a new "bitcoin" will be born and will eat Roger Ver big business Coin.
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:52:06
Yes, but they could split too !
If BU miners get relayed by BU Nodes and sell their coins from the newly split chain it will be useless to orphan them.
Now, the sustainability of the BU chain is another question.
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:29:22
They also enforce the rules too, the majority of the hash power enforce those rules, also full non mining nodes enforce those same rules too (even if they don't create blocks).
Full non mining nodes keep in check the miners, each time a full mining nodes disappear, the miners get more power and the network become less secure (The Nash equilibrium get broken).
@_date: 2016-11-29 01:49:31
Problem even with what you said it's still pure charity based (people don't think like that too), if the cost become too hight, nodes will drop out, that's why block size increases should be as conservative as possible...
@_date: 2016-11-29 12:00:35
No, you enforce the rules, if miners mine a different reward or a different rules the block wont be relayed and added in your local copy of your blockchain, hence orphaning that block.
@_date: 2016-11-17 14:20:37
Mainstream'er will fuck everything with greed and politics it's just the tragedy of the common nothing more...
People want Paypal 2.0, miners want profit and full greed even if it destroy everything.
Let's be clear if BTC goes full retard with BU and mining cartel then the project have failed, nothing to add. Time to move something else this time in walled garden mode :)
The permissionless activity was about transaction censorship resistance not messing up with incompatible software and putting at risk the security and the permissionsless activities of that network, a centralized bitcoin with miners having more power than before (this is what BU do with the block-size parameter) is completely useless, new boss same as the old boss...

No, money is also a store of value only a Keynesian don't think so.
Like I said, market will price in immediately with ALL available public information, an inflationary coin will only go downward in long term, even if the coin doesn't move.
If Satoshi's coin would start to move it would create a flash crash but would recover as fast as it happened.
In an inflationary coin, you have permanently a downward selling pressure contrary to deflationary one where you have a net buying pressure.
You simply can't have an upward pressure in long term with an inflationary coin, nobody will store (or even use !) that coin.

Yes, it depend on how it grow, if too fast with big blocks average joe wont be to keep it. maybe too hard to understand.


You mix everything, processing power will grow sure, the chain too the difference is how fast, a chain who grow at 1 MB block size have better chance to stay decentralized than one at 10 or worse unlimited...

Lets be clear I would be as worried if the hash power was 90 % in USA !
China have all that hash power because of gov subsidy and free energy...
Not because they "compete".
Anyway no matter what you think its still a bad idea and we must speak about it and how to mitigate it if Chinese miners goes evil !
Real life scenario: what would happen to bitcoin if Chinese started to evade massively capitals control and the gov get nervous with that and with 75 % hash power in China's soil, eh ?
They will be tempted to change the rule to censor transactions...
This reason alone is why we need to deal with Chinese mining concentration problem.

I am not interested in big businesses even if they are a few hundreds to run, gov can subpoena them to change rules and make KYC/AML more easily on chain or some shit like that.

If 2 MB get "full" again, does the r/btc crowd will still want increase even at the risk to break down the network ?
If yes, we shouldn't compromise at all...
SW as an HF proved to be dangerous and could be quite messy, more importantly old nodes get kicked out from the network.
There are many arguments against an HF that somebody could list there.
The network is fine, BTW it will be always "congestioned" as low fees and spam will fill up every block no matter the size of it, it's supply and demand 101: give a cheap or free resource and people will use and abuse it...
The block-size is a technical and security parameter, recently a paper explained that without fees and small block size bitcoin can be subject to attacks, their solution was to use inflation to mitigate those attacks (which is inconceivable in bitcoin).
More and more evidence suggest a relatively small block size and the need of fees pressure...
The argument that that big blocks doesn't hurt decentralization and nodes counts is simply false, since years we had more and more users and the nodes count still go down.
Lastly, BU give more power to miners, it give the block size parameter in the hand of miners, it's like telling a wolf to guard a sheep...
They were proven false and even dangerous on many technical aspect and yet still whine...
We can out hash them,
We can change PoW them,
And many other "solutions" if they still attack us (yes I consider them as an attack now).
Have a nice day.

Shit I deleted my message above... when wanting to edit...
Some miners will not follow the HF by ideological reasons (be it BU Or Core).
Ethereum proved that any contentious fork will result in two chains, worse with low activation threshold such as 75 % the other 25% can survive and even thrive.
A new "bitcoin" could come as an alt (not a fork, a new coin with ICO and so on).
What would happen as disappointed user I create a new alt that would follow Core road-map right now in case that miners do the folly to switch to BU, hmm ? :) :):) I am pretty sure my ICO would be successful you see ?
Let's reverse things: Why you don't make an alt yourself and ICO on Polo ? hmm ? If you believe so much in BU ?
@_date: 2016-11-19 00:40:55

God do you meant that if we "upgrade" to BU we will introduce attack vector in a ETH style fashion ?
More seriously based on your explanation BU is a whole new security model than Bitcoin as envisioned by Satoshi:
1) Non mining are "useless" put everything in the hands of miners.
2) A constant chain split risk because everyone use the block limit they want...
According to your research their "emergent consensus" will not work, what they will get is a broken consensus.
One more thing that make me fall of my chair:


Of course miners are good Samaritan and even if they were, nobody will try to exploit that like nobody tried to exploit the recursive call attack in The DAO...

Nodes count is getting down even with that:
1) More user than 3 year ago.
2) Even with a small block of 1 MB !
3) Most (new) user don't care, the will only go mobile wallet, Coinbase and SPV.
4) Full nodes only run by (big) businesses are useless, big businesses are centralized point of failure which gov could subpoena and force them to change the protocol (to let's say install privacy killing "features".) See also IRS fishing at Coinbase topic.


The proof is simple: if anyone can spin up Sybil nodes, successfully get 51 % and attack then it's not enough.
The less there is nodes the more easy is to attack.
Also if nodes are only miners it meant that miners have full power over the network, they can do whatever they want...
Last thing, Government can seize easily those single point of failure, its what we call a systemic risk.
Also the more diverse nodes the better.

Ouch now I can see clearly you hatred of China and Chinese thanks for showing your true face.
A lot to say again here.
Maybe Chinese intelligence saw it all but decided it was fine and well let's respect that two countries two system in place and let's not make direct  intervention here. 
China have probably better interest to let HK collapse and as predicted the HK'er are just ruining themselves.
Don't worry Chinese intel probably know about this anyway I don't work in Chinese intel so can't say anything about that and that would be national security stuff anyway.
For the extradition bills so I guess it's OK to let a guy who killed his GF have happy days in HK... I must remind you every countries have extradition treaty with each other why it should be different with China ah yeah it's because China...
For those demand none are justified. Police in HK haven't done until now not even 10 % of what happened here in my "democratic" France with the yellow vest or not even 1 % of what would happen in US if such riots would happen.
In US they would be shot and killed remember "black lives" matters ?
Sorry these are not, protesters when you attack children, beat women and journalist because they come from mainland when you throw acid on cops or beat them when one cop is isolated. Throw cocktail molotov in banks or some CCP building and so on.
HK was is and will be China so "universal suffrage" will be not accorded if those "students" aren't happy with sovereignty of China they can move in USA: last time I checked the CCP don't prevent them to take a flight for Washington.
You are wrong, they want nation independence: HK is city like any others in China. It's China's sovereignty they just have a temporary special treatment called one COUNTRY two systems. In 2047 it just stop period.
For the drug war the "deal" was "you take our shit or else we come with our army again and we destroy you." not some corrupt class and merchant who wanted to make a quick buck as primary cause.
For Fentanyl nobody force you buy this shit you are all drug addict in your "free" America.
The world is laughing (more like fed up) at America who sanction, bully everyone who don't want to follow her wills and be her vassal. Even your own "allies" are fed up of you...
And last HK is China's internal problem so US should stay away from that it's like China would support Texas secession from the Union. (Maybe she should do that too :)

In US a a big fortune 500 CEO who do shady things pay a fine and get almost nothing try that here in mainland. For example a guy got caught with 13 tons of Gold in his mansion here in China it was corruption proceed he risk lifetime sentence. In US you have banks like Goldman Sachs who literally cheat the market, cheat the LIBOR rate and so on they get a fine at best and it's business as usual...

It's not an excuse, it's from preventing stuff like that happening with mainland citizen. CCP is being proactive here in case such things happen in the future. The protest aren't justified (since when foreign funded and prepared protest are justifiable ?)
Since when it's fair that a citizen from a foreign country can get extradited when none of mainland Chinese can't ? 
Why those "protest" are triggered and supported right when China is in trade war with US ?
Please, US should mind his own business about China's internal affairs and not support rioters and terrorist because it give leverage to some trade war and play your geopolitics plans, it will fail thanks.

Europe is divided about that, it seems we play all the games. The problem is how to not make feel shit our US "partner" and yet don't shoot in our feet economically and politically on international matters. 
China already pay in Yuan and Ruble, those two countries made huge swap of energy, minerals and so on a few years ago. USD isn't used anymore on those bilateral trades between those two countries.

This  is typical colored revolution made courtesy by US !
NED and Chinese hawk's in Washington are financing them Trump let it go because it give leverage in the trade war...
It's not the CCP who created this mess, this extradition bill was made because a fucking guy who killed his GF flow to HK where there is no extradition treaty with both mainland and Taiwan.
Aside that HK is a part of China those protesters (now more like rioters with strong "antifa" connection) want independence which isn't possible because in 2047 HK will be de-facto treated as a Chinese city like everywhere so that's a dead end.
You should read history book (HK was China before the imperialistic UK's drug war) and will go back mainland one day or another.
Let me tell you something Asian are proud, Chinese will never let go HK be a US puppet regime just a few km from it's border they will prefer lose some trade and GDP points than getting humiliated a second time by westerners. (The first was the drug war 200 years ago they still remember it even the young mainlander :)

I can choose my chain in an eventual split, the minority chain can even HF with a different PoW and even change the difficulty it's very simple to do.
Full non mining nodes enforce those rules in a particular chain, if miners decide to goes silly they will be not accepted by my node and any miner who mine blocks according to my rules will be accepted and relayed back...
Actually non mining nodes are as important as money power and mining nodes...
So stop spreading lies from r/btc who falsely believe that non mining nodes are irrelevant and give full power to the miners because it fit some agenda...
You need both non mining nodes and miners to make your coin secure and decentralized.
When you run a full node you secure your money against theft and illegal protocol change !
When you run SPV you aren't trustless anymore, you trust miners respecting the rules, for the gazillion time I will persist and sign: full non mining nodes keep miners in check !
Now let's drop that because it's useless to argue like that and you seems little confused.

I agree partly but Full nodes doesn't follow invalid rules and since SPV are connected to those same full nodes...
For example my Electrum wallet detect forks now and let me split my coins.
And and I can force connect to a Core node and avoid getting tricked, I don't know about other wallets.
So, it's possible for SPV to defend against attacks.
What is not possible is to protect against massive reorgs but I think some tricks could be used to protect against that too.

Yes ! Do you understanding that Hodlers don't care and can wait the diff down ? I can even use your own arguments against you ! If a chain is slow you can't dump that easily and it will keep value.
Also you forget that miners will go back to the most profitable chain because they are only here for the money.
So the theory that market follow hashpower is false. (if it was true the forkers wouldn't need to pump S2X futures that badly.)

Nope, prenup can separate property even in the marriage period, at least in my country it's like that !
Each other own their stuff.


I would mean it's a scam because it take just an "I am not happy" (hence frivolous divorce and often well helped by lawyers who work in the "divorce industry") to get stole half of your hard earned shit even if you are the primary breadwinner and since at least 50 % of marriage end up in divorce with 75 % of them initiated by the wife you get clearly the picture that marriage is scam at least for men of high value !
Imagine I am businessman and someone tell me when you sign this contract you have 50 % chance to get fucked with 75 % percent chance that it will be your "partner" who do it, do you will enter such contract ? hell not !
Once again given those facts I can safely and rationally conclude that marriage (at least without prenup and separation of assets before and after marriage) is a scam !

So we can't peg Bcash ok, fine but we can do fat blocks on a sidechain without compromising the security of the main chain.
The main chain should stay small block (1 or 2 MB) and the side chain should experiment with big and fat blocks (8MB, 100MB, 1GB and so on). Trade-off between security and cheap fast payment without messing up the core layer.

Nope, difference is that it can be seized or shut down by a malicious actor...
Also it's not because you can run bigger blocks that you must force other to run bigger blocks and price out them of the node network...
Less nodes = less secure network, there is a reason that cartels want less nodes: they can't change the protocol as they wish. Remember: "node are useless !" (meanwhile the forkers spin 1400 fake S2X nodes on same IP range in AWS, sound legit lulz :)

**I humbly profit to hijack your post for saying to the public here that WEX (BTC-e) will give back your funds when they are frozen.**
*You will need to do:*
*1) Getting verified: Passport (spread), proof of residence, selfie of yourself holding your passport.*
*2) Proving some transaction history: screenshots of your wallets, Crypto transactions, screenshots of addresses with blocktrail...*
*3) Proving your Email by sending a screenshot of your email box.*
*4) If support doesn't answer send back a ticket or message.*
*5) Some patience and never give mentality (true for everything in life).*
*It was long and painful but in the end if you don't give up you will get your coins back.*
*Very important: take screenshot of everything including your WEX account balance, the ticket support discussion, transaction history and so on.*
*Hope it help for those who have stuck funds in WEX.*

Let me rephrase it again, they were not doing that for decade as interest where higher they were just doing it sporadically. Now it's a policy itself and worse it seems to not only doesn't solve the problem but hide something much more ugly. Again there is no need of that if banks were proposing more than 0.05 % on "savings" account instead of always asking Gov. free money. Market.exe is broken.

1) I want to buy some BTC because I hear on TV how awesome it is...
2) I go online or even go to random BTC ATM.
3) I buy BTC.
4) Now, I when I move them and try to spend them the merchant tell me "That's not BTC, that's BCH you have there".
It's obviously that I got defrauded buying a fake product.

Nope, it was used as store of value because it have the most value/weight ratio (scarcity). Before that stone where used as money, even seashell ! But they proved you can't use that to run a more complex economy and it was not scarce at all (low value/weight ratio), humans then used fruits, wheat and other commodities like that but abandoned it because it perish (bad store of value over time). Gold became king because it's one of the most scarce and chemically stable element on earth ! It have a very hight value/weight ratio. After bankers started issuing paper money backed by Gold because it was not practicable and safe to wander with coins in the wild. Then the scam started (banksters print more paper gold than phyzz in reality) and you know the sequel.
TLDR: A currency is always recognized as a store of value before being used as everyday transactions, only a Keynesian mind would think otherwise.

You could go back on chain for long term hodling, let's say months or even years...
Onchain: savings and gold storage, international settlement.

Then I fear we won't scale on chain soon (which I don't give a fuck at all). Moore's law is basically dead at this point. 
But who know, maybe in 10 years S2X will make sense and will not threaten at all the security model. If it's really the case (proven by real research) then I will gladly go along with 2X. 
But I prefer that bigger blocks goes on a drivechain and the base layer stay like that forever. A drive chain like I said in another message, could handle GB blocks with the trade-off to be less secure and more centralized.

The Guardian is a piece of liberal and Western propaganda following closely Washington orders (if you believe the Western press is free and impartial it might be better to start believing in unicorns.)
Now, it's not because they relayed the Edward Snowden incident that they are not a (US Neo-CON) propaganda machine as their anti Russian rhetoric prove it.
So, like I said the first part was good but the last part destroyed your arguments and I suspect that your message is more related to a Russophobic stance than (rightly) worrying and debating about the consequence of a block increase.

If BTC transactions are stuck that bad it will just disincentive people to empty their wallet and panic sell... Call that a cooling down market mechanism...
Some weak hands admitted that they wanted buy BCH but couldn't do it because the transaction was stuck missing the bubble (and potentially saving them losing money).

I fear more the slippery slope what will happen when 2 MB will be "full" raise again ? You see block size increase is just can kicking it solve nothing
Also we need that the network to be optimized with SW and IBLT before raising the block size substantially.

Only on-chain scaling "solution" ...

Just a question (trying to understand your point) what you will do if 2 MB start to get full ? Go 4 ? 8 ? 32 ? and lastly 8 GB ?
There is a slippery slope here as big block hurt decentralization.
That's why I said it's can kicking, even if you go alts such as ETH or LTC and if they become popular, they will have the same problems one day, it's inherent of blokchain tech: they scale very badly.
*Ideally we should stop block-size scaling at 32 MB after of course all network upgrade and that we don't see node count or miners collapsing, it was Satoshi original limit but I think we are many many years away from 32 MB !*
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:17:47

@_date: 2016-02-05 11:17:15


So you will have always coins created out of thin air and it always devalue, also the market will price in your inflation (ie your alt is a bad store of value).
In this sense Bitcoin &gt;&gt; to any inflationary alt !


Bitcoin will never become "expensive" (you will buy fractional bitcoin or even satoshi).


Bitcoin will scale up with moderate block increase but more importantly LN, side chains and so on making alt irrelevant.


It's not because that inflation is decided by the people that's it's a good thing. Lastly Alt coin are mostly pump and dump scheme or a joke (like Doge, it was a meme who is at the origin of Doge.)


Each year less and less Gold is mined and cost more and more we have already peak Gold.
Bitcoin is in inflation phase BUT the 21 million cap is priced in unlike Doge who still print every year for the eternity !!!
Alt are just game for trader like us, some may have interesting properties and innovation but you can count them on you hands...

@_date: 2016-02-26 17:16:31
Well Chinese miners themselves told us that 8 MB was in red part of the scale already, in 10-15 years if we go 32 MB without f*cking up decentralization I would be really happy but I am very skeptical.
There is a problem also about node financial incentives, actually we only do that by altruism: put pressure on us and we will drop out, then big evil corp such as Coinabse, Bitpay, Circle, Xapo, etc ,etc and Chinese miners will get full control of BTC...
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:32:10
So you can predict future ? Good !
Only one drawback on your very long message.
If your prediction turn out to be false you fuck up everything, sorry too much risk.
So you can't scale bitcoin on statistic (I know what are statistic and many of their predictions are just false or out of reality at best).
So the best approach is to be very conservative, we can always hard fork in the future if we have absolute necessity and we have the tech do to it.
Actually the max that we could do is the 2-4-8 plan after the Core optimization of block broadcasting and verifying.
@_date: 2016-02-13 11:04:54
You misunderstood me 100 % !
I meant Classic forkers and their fan should make their own blockchain, launching an alt and leave us the original Bitcoin (Core) working without getting bothered.

@_date: 2016-02-25 11:52:58
They completely missed the point that those nodes will be like Tor and even use Tor so the risk of being regulated is very very low...

3) No need source, it will because it's unsustainable to do both.
4) Stop your anti-capitalist diatribe, it's tiresome... And no, if people can "earn" money without doing shit or take risk they will sit around...

There is a no limit (no hard limit) it meant that one day bitcoin can centralize around big players with GB limit even if you use an average step up function !
I know it will reach an "equilibrium" when everything will be centralized since it's **easier** and **cheaper** to run things **centralized**, a thing that you seems to not understand or you avoid to speak about !
It's a no go sorry, always, always with your big blocks it start to be really tiresome, but I don't worry so much (in fact I worry a little since I have **MONEY** invested in BTC) competition will solve this problem: a more decentralized alt will take care of it.

That's why BTC must be conceived the most possible to be censorship resistant and anonymous ecosystem.

@_date: 2016-02-08 12:49:14
Explain what ?
It's pretty clear no ?
Again... , a larger bitcoin will become VISA because it's more easy (less costly) to centralize things to get more TPs but if you centralize the whole point of bitcoin being attractive dissapear, better to use Paypal.
So please if you want to centralize BTC or see no problem by doing so, sell your Coin and go alt or Paypal and fast !

Why it's no starter ? The fee will be low BTW LN will be very competitive as anyone could run a node.
If it's non-starter then BTC is not for you too: BTC will need to raise fee one day for just securing the network (as inflation to secure the network is out of question in BTC world).

If it's the case and lead to an emergency situation Core can change the PoW (work against hostile HF too).

"Corecoin" (Bitcoin) can defend itself by changing the PoW and avoid getting 51 % attacked.

Very interesting plus some simulations about behavior of the network.
Lightning is interesting but still have problem to solve obviously but I am fairly confident that they will be solved in the near future.
It would be great that LN could leverage TPS by a factor at least 100x or more.
For example a 3 TPS bitcoin network would become a 300 TPS one and a 30 TPS (10 MB block limit) would become near visa scale with 3000 TPS !

Just answering for FlexCap, FlexCap have a big problem: it's no limit: pricing out smaller player and node out of market thus leading to centralization in BitPay (or whatever big Corp) data-centers.
A problem that you haven't studied (pressure on low resource node and miners who keep BTC decentralized away from Gov and Big Corp.)
Any no limit solution is a total no go, can you propose FlexCap with an hard limit ?
@_date: 2016-02-27 18:27:24

It take time to get my trust, oh wait in BTC I shouldn't trust anyone BTW.

More reasonable comment here except the fake sense of emergency by writing "now" in capital letter...
@_date: 2016-02-29 02:28:20
Exact reverse: big block = Chinacoin and centralized miners who are incited to be physically close to each others to avoid getting orphaned...
Also big blocks = pressure on nodes operating cost (which will increase centralization.)
PS: I am for 2 MB HF as band aid or kick can, not as a scaling "solution", blocks will be limited in the future.

Can someone ELI8 again in details the Blockstream income model ?
**Even as a strong Core supporter I am little worried here, 55 millions USD is fucking huge !**
**EDIT: Also LN must be CENSORSHIP RESISTANT with NUMEROUS NODES around the globe not in a few hand of payment processor that can KYC/AML you !**

Now miners want full control of the network with another game theory and network config by using EC.
Not to mention a centralized Chinese miner have a conflict of interest between upgrading SW (who break this "advantage") or stalling it (ASICBOOST).
Like I said above, Bitcoin is run by a Rothschildian Kabbal if nothing is done to avoid the Evil miners and miners centralization problem, then we must admit that the concept of Bitcoin isn't viable in the long term...

OK I understand better now, but the main advantage would be that even if slower it's decentralized, it should be implemented as a back up like you said in case the centralized relay network is attacked.
So we could have:
1) Relay Network (the fastest but centralized).
2) Xtreme Thin Block (in case RN is attacked, slower but more decentralized).
3) Normal old Satoshi propagation (in case Xtreme Net is out, more slower but fully decentralized).
Different hard block size for those different mode could be used too...
It would give a fail safe mechanism and resilience of the network by redundancy !

Your solution is like:
Let's make a very heavy plane and we don't care about weight optimization of that plane we have bigger and bigger engine anyway...

I don't think I miss the point: my point is that if goverment wanted to take down BTC going for miners (who aren't even obfuscated) was far more simpler, also those LN nodes doesn't control the funds so they are not money transmitter per se.
Nodes can be operated by anyone too, if some nodes get take down other will arise in greater number much like DNMs after SilkRoad.
Bitcoin Nodes operate with plain IP address are very easy to take down them, if you fear LN "take downing" you should really fear Bitcoin Nodes and Miners take down !

Also for the UBI to work (without hyperinflation).
1) It must be financed by tax income or state income (much like oil income in Alaska).
2) The country must have strict immigration policies (so that not all people from the third-world come to flood the country to get free sh*t.)
3) It must replace all the current welfare programs, meaning that people will subscribe private social security and insurances.

I don't know but I wouldn't trust so much about those statistic and politics about women/minorities in STEM (or any fields), it's really complicated to explain but there is a lot of politics and SJW in universities (like Title IX) and things who tend to "promote" women in STEM like by changing standards, the level/skill of courses, different notation system to actively promote "minority" groups such as women or blacks. I've heard of people around the web who noticed that female student are far less likely to be severely rated by teachers.
Universities will get funding on how much minority group they graduate in a year...
I think College is now dead or plain unhealthy because of that, better to learn online I think...
When there is no SJW politics and pure competition/skills we always find natural balance by having an overwhelming majority of men when it come to STEM and entrepreneurship much like here in BTC...
Also one possible explanation: women are very risk adverse, bitcoin is risky business: you can lost you shirt, literally !

Sure we can probably handle 2 MB or even 4 MB but I fear we get the slippery slope here.

The equation is fairly simple:
"Core coin" with low/moderate block size and with very talented devs + LN and sidechains vs "Classic coin" with less talented devs and very bigblocks as the only scaling plan...

Well I just read the Classic "Roadmap" Phase III is about flex cap... No limit, full power, good for centralization or how those who have better connection or equipment can price out everyone and centralize.
Well, I understand partially your worries but I will stick with Core for now, FlexCap without hard limit is a no go.
@_date: 2016-02-04 11:18:23
You have right about your worries you wrote here, the side effect is that if LN is too centralized (too few node run it) nobody will use it and the purpose of LN will lose all interest.
Sidechains will be other crypto protocols pegged to BTC so I don't think in this case VC firms could abuse it. (We could easily peg a monero style sidecoin, or a fast conf high block one too !)
It's also to you, user too choose the most decentralized sidechain and installing LN nodes when those tech will be available too keep it decentralized. (it's obvious that if it's only VC firms running those nodes, censorship could occur.)
I don't worry so much since if think the first one to setup anonymous and censorship resistant nodes will be DNM operator.
But that said we must still vigilant about centralization pressure.

LN ain't perfect (there still some risk to solve and it's till in development) but better than fitting coffee transactions on chain with big block size, on chain transactions should be used for high value or settlement not coffee transaction !
Many of you oppose LN because you want to scale up to coffee transaction on chain.
BTW, since you are here, what you will do when 2 MB will be full ? go 4 MB ? 8 MB and end up 8 GB in data centers ?
Do your team realize that at least that increasing block size is **not a solution** but a **band aid** to give room for real scaling solution ?

Bitcoin will be more like settlement system, especially that block-chain scale very badly (without killing it's decentralization and censorship resistance nature).
*The first day I bought bitcoin 2 years ago I immediately understood what I said above, you will never have coffee transaction on chain, BTC is digital gold and settlement system so I am not surprised.*
*At that time I got a lot of down-votes for simply pointing out that block-chain tech scale very badly especially decentralized censorship resistant tech.*

That said the state fucked big time with the "Assignat" and hyperinflation...
Hell, the income was only invented in 1914, it was meant to finance the war effort and after the war finished was meant to be abolished...
I could quote another more recent tax such as CSG-RDS (the French folks will understand it here) it was meant to finance the deficit of the social security and meant to temporary, result ?
The deficit increased, the tax stayed and the rate only increased since that time...
Gubernment are planning so well !

Liberals will remove the legal aspect that a child can't consent, in reality a 15 years old is mature enough to give full consent especially in our hypersexualized society where 11 years old watch porn in their phone in the bus...
Marriage is an institution.
For creating a family,
Recognizing that a man a woman love each other.
Procreating and protecting the future children.
It's an institution for giving the best chance that the children will survive and do it well later.
Gay marriage is nothing more an ego trip.
Gay just want to imitate hetero-normative relationship while they will be never be able to do so...
It's a mere copy in fact gays can't accept their own difference by saying we don't need marriage, I know gays who are against gay marriage they don't need it fucking marriage to live together and live their romance... Hell we have even some civil union !
Gay marriage proponents are just one of those active minorities (even among gays themselves) who just playing their fucking ego centric victimization card.

It doesn't work. We can't guarantee that 1 BTC block is systematically lost or burned.
There is also no guarantee and like I said before if BTC need to raise the number of coin for surviving then this experiment is dead.

God, I am done, you know you are deadly wrong and still insist with your lack of logic.
Marriage is an institution period, it's something that exist from thousands of years and is a "tool" to create stable family with the best chance to survive, raise children and let them grow and evolve in the world when they get older not something to play with for an ego trip.
The ego trip is gay marriage who is just nothing more than wannabe marriage.
You need marriage to form a family and recognized to the state and society that you are linked with the man/woman you love...
So like I said, (a small part of Gays) just wanted to imitate heteros, hating themselves ?
Another things wake me up when they will be able to reproduce naturally without using surrogate slave from India to "have" a child...
Hell, they even ban adoption to certain countries who have gay marriage and child adoption.
Last thing, they don't need marry, a simple civil contract will do the job perfectly !
Thanks for pointing me r/thedonald, if I was American he may have won one vote today :)
So now see you, glad that liberalism is more and more discredited and actively fought !

If you mess up you will just be orphaned that's simple my full node and thousands of others will just kick you off from the network, that's fucking protocol rules: being a miner doesn't give you special privilege.
Put that in your mind: WE HIRE YOU to order transactions in blocks and the day we are not satisfied with your services you get fired. I need to translate in Chinese or what ?
So come down from your horse, keep calm and mine.

USA again have attacked so much countries that I even don't recall how many of them... Russia not so much just defending itself.
Russia is fine: no trillion debt, lowest tax on Earth, restructuring to be less dependent on oil (thanks USA and Saudi Arabia !) super deals with Chinese and new alliance.


Fine as long you use to finance Kiev Nazi, Bank account get blocked if you are suspected to finance other side with BTC.
Labeled as "terrorist" because they don't want to submit to USA imperialism.
And in all honesty why the Ukrainian Gov will be scared when they have desperately set a 30% key interest to avoid capital flight, Hryvnia is virtually dead. Thank IMF (with Greek money ?) for giving loans...


Doesn't change the fact she want to fuck EU (and I must recognize that she is doing it very well !)
*How about your gold when the Kiev junta took power back in 2014 you know a mysterious plane took all your CBU Gold and disappeared in the nothingness.

If you want failed states, I will name Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Ukraine, then tried to do the same shit in Chinese backwards (Hong-Kong).
All states where USA are directly or indirectly disturbing, because USA need war to survive for it's dying economy simple as that.
Without USA meddling, Bitcoin will be thriving right now in Russia and even Ukraine !

Crazy "market manipulation" idea about Fiat -&gt; Bitcoin exchange.
What if exchanges, with for example a 0.1 % trading fee, started to accumulate this fee in an address and stack here thus reducing the available supply thus pumping the price ?
The biggest exchange have nearly 1 million in 24 hours volume, it will be about 1000 BTC per 24 hours going out of the market (in reality less due exchange expense).

Can't give you numbers out of my ass like that, let's a specialist answer you, but I would say no more than of today's multisig transactions. (LN are usually 2/2 transactions.)
Also SW "compress" (with Schnorr algo ?) the size of those multi-sig transaction in the SW part of the block-size (the traditional 1 MB limit).

Also you aren't sure that it will happen like you said (nodes will increase with more users) so I will choose conservatism and will stay on 1 MB + SW + LN for now and see what happen since SW is already on-chain scaling, then after I will maybe advocate a slight bump to 2 or 4 MB if everything is fine.

Speak for yourself, Troll.
In case your IQ is under room temp:
1) Contentious HF create coin split and hurt the price in long term.
2) You deify him with your "Satoshi original vision" and the Holy White Paper...
3) It pretty clear, things sometimes change radically. Bitcoin won't be Visa scale and only on-chain scaling especially if you want to preserve decentralization and privacy.
But I don't expect you understand that, especially from a r/btc'er and one of Roger Ver's boyfriend...

Well you try to argue for nothing now...
I just showed you that bitcoin ATM are still exchanges now you argue about online exchanges, ok fine...
There is Virwox who is online and ask you 20 % spread...
Well you will argue back "it's because they have thin order book" or something like that or "they take huge make up because highly risky".
What I showed you is that 1 % is not that big, sure bigger than stamp or BTC-e or finex but some are ten times than that !
Also I will argue back that LBC is not a centralized exchange like stamp or finex volume are lower, you can't compare them.

* Leave the project ?
* Leave the project then create an alt that respect our decentralized cypher-punk ethos ?

Like I said: it's time build Mixing function by default in the Core wallet ! Things like CoinJoin, if not Bitcoin will be out-competed by more privacy oriented alts such as Dash or Monero.
For the first time of my Bitcoiner life I think that Bitcoin can be out-competed by an alt !
Scary times indeed !
The urgent problem is not the block-size anymore it's the privacy, anonymity and fungibility of BTC !
**Can core devs can take care of this huge problem right now and let's drop the blocksize shit storm for a while ?**
I haven't invested in Govcoin comrade !
For now, I will start study Dash and Monero, what they plan to do in the future (Lightning, GUI, SPV wallet and so on) and maybe even promote them instead of BTC.

While I agree that 100 k USD will do a lesser price increase in the long term, it will do a buying pressure especially that we halve the next year.
100 k USD per day will move the price for sure not in the 2013 way but it will move the price.

Yeah but the public blockchain is the part of Bitcoin itself.
To keep a functional blockchain and Bitcoin while remaining totally private it would take [homomorphic encryption.](
The "Art" to execute encrypted programs and codes.
The beauty of that thing is that you can execute code without the need to be in plain text ! But the research still just theoretical for now.
Aside that diverse mixing technique can be implemented at protocol level (Zerocoin/Cash) or at wallet level Coinjoin/Shuffle) to improve anonymity and privacy.

I'm no sure to get your point but devaluation is completely useless with countries who have:
No natural resources, no industries anymore, don't do proper fiscal and structural reforms.
And even with that the benefit of the devaluation is temporary let's say one or two years while savers and consumers get full screwed from the beginning.
Again, weak currencies doesn't make you wealthier especially true for the average Joe/Jane.
Even those who invest in markets can get devaluated if those markets doesn't rise enough in nominal terms like Nikkei225 in Japan who in Yen terms have risen but at best is stable in Dollar terms. (USDJPY effect).
Now devaluation raise our inputs (cost for business) (commodities, raw materials, energies and so on) thus nullifying the eventual benefits from devaluation (selling our stuff more cheaply) since business must raise price to face the raising cost of those inputs.
I don't even want to point out about the high risk of currencies war with major countries making an orgy of devaluation around the world and putting the financial system at high risk of implosion worldwide...

Some idea...
Some alt speak about proof of stake in plus of POW.
You have a stack in your wallet, leave your computer on (running your node) and you get interest on mining or fees in respect of how much you saved in your wallet.
If you have 1 % of all coin in existence you get 1 % of the network revenue (for example fees).
The drawback is that it will require an heavy fork and testing before being operational.

1) Like you could blacklist some addresses in the actual blockchain unfortunately. (like Coinbase...)
2) Nothing is perfect but what you describe is far preferable than being on a full centralized chain with not even being able to serve hight velocity hight traffic as LN can do... (unless you want GBs blocksize in Jihad's data-center...) 
For the 100 USD fees indeed an exchange or any service could offer them (to attract customers) but you could receive your wage make payment from there, over time as transactions increase such high fees aren't a gig deal... Also with LN you can send payment outside your channel by using your party as a relying hug. A compagnie already made it on LTC alt.
I don't think BTC/LN will replace banks totally at least if LN evolve in this bank model that you fear, it would far far better in term of financial sovereignty and sound money than what he have today.
But since the barrier to entry to this market is very low, I except a lot of nodes servicing LN. Hell even miners will do it to collect some extra fees !

The good point is that I am not forced to use it.
The bad point it's that the only one of the alts (maybe with two others) that provide good anonymity.
But your inflationary policy destroy everything of it's advantage.
Even if coins are lost it's doesn't justify the creation of new coins out of fine air so that's a non sequitur here.
I personally think that inflationary system is worst system that we can have, it can't be used as a store of value.
Money that lose value via inflation is not money.
So I will not promote Monero as a viable alt coin (even if the cryptographic aspect is very interesting) but the economic part is catastrophic.

Yes, maybe but still have perpetually new coins created out of thin air...
Also they could change it in the future (I assume that's it's very easy to HF ETF).
Also even with this scheme (let's say 100 ETH are created per block eternally) you still need create wealth to just compensate those newly created coins eternally which is highly not possible in the long term. BTC is far superior regarding store of value.

So it doesn't matter because it will fail.
Consumers will pay more, savers will lose; any benefits from devaluation comes with high price to pay.
Devaluation are use by incompetent peoples and politics who don't want to do structural/fiscal reforms.

The conservative forbid you some "choice" for the well being of yourself and society.
The socialist allow some "choice" even the bad one but bail-out you if it goes wrong for yourself and society at large with the power of the state (and ultimately others peoples money).
The libertarian consider that you are an adult and capable to make rational decision for yourself and society at large, if things goes south then you must assume the consequence of your own action.
Ultimately a libertarian is neither socialist, neither conservative.
In reality you have many sensibilities of it.

Depend on how divergence you are time traveling...
You don't travel in past of your own world (it's not possible since you need to break the speed of light).
But theoretically possible by traveling to other worlds even if this world is very close to your original one (low divergence).
It would be far more profitable to go back in past with low divergence and invest in BTC:
1) From point A in your timeline go back to B in past.
2) Invest in BTC in 2011.
3) don't tell to anybody (it will modify history of that timeline and creating tool much divergence...)
4) Go in the future of that timeline (the one you invested BTC).
5) Cash out (maybe in gold or cash) or in an unused address who are no used in both worlds (your original world and the one you travel).
6) Once cashed out go back in past in B or slightly before you arrival !
7) From here you can go back in something very very close to your original world but with being millionaire !!
8) Profit !

Because 100 ETH worth nothing right now in my example about 1000 USD each block... 
But imagine an ETH bubbling at 1000 or 10 000 USD, if ETH survive of course how much money you must pump every day to just avoid inflation ? 
That's why I think all those inflationary coins will never goes mainstream (even with big blocks) like the deflationary ones can do...

Lightning Inter-node Protocol: A Primer
The original protocol I wrote for two lightning nodes to communicate was simple: to make a change, you proposed it and sent the signature for their commitment transaction, they replied with the revocation secret for the previous one and a signature for you, then you finished it by providing a signature for them. If both sides proposed changes at the same time, one backed off.
Unfortunately, it was too simple: Joseph Poon wanted something far more efficient. Doing that well has been a longer journey than I wanted, but it’s worth writing up where we got to as it’s bound to cause much confusion.
There are two ways we make it more efficient: batching means we can send more than one update at once, and desynchronization means both sides are independent. The rules for doing this are not very complicated, but the system overall can be very hard to follow; so much so that I ended up writing a protocol simulator to be sure it works.
Each node keeps track of two commitment transactions; its local one (which it will drop to the blockchain if anything goes wrong), and the remote one (which it might see on the blockchain if the otherside releases it). For both the local and remote commitments, it keeps track of two types of changes: unacknowledged changes, and acknowledged changes.
Node A pushes a batch of updates to the remote commitment, such as “offer this new HTLC”, “I redeem your existing HTLC” or “your existing HTLC failed to route”. At some point, A locks them in by sending a commit message with its signature for the new remote commitment transaction with those changes. Node B checks the signature, and returns the revocation preimage for its previous commitment transaction, promising never to use it.
So node B has a signed commitment transaction with the changes, but node A hasn’t. We could have node B send exactly the same updates back to A, followed by a commit, but the revocation message serves the same purpose: A knows that B has seen all those updates, so it can now queue those changes to its own commitment transaction. But it still needs B’s signature.
So B now sends its own update message, signing A’s commitment transaction with those changes applied. A checks the signature, and sends its previous revocation preimage to obsolete the old commitment transaction. Both sides are in sync.
Here’s an autogenerated diagram of A adding HTLC 
A Full Cycle for a Single HTLC Add
The General Case
To deal with the case where B makes simultaneous proposals, we need to get a little bit more formal. Remember that each node makes proposals for the remote side; these changes only get applied locally once they’re acked.
When a node first sends an update, it adds it to its remote unacked list.
When a node receives an update, it adds it to its local unacked list. This mirrors the above, so both sides have the same lists (my remote = your local, and vice versa).
When a node sends a commitment, it first applies everything in its remote lists: both acked and unacked.
When a node receives a commitment, it applies everything in its local lists: both acked and unacked. It then copies its local unacked list (ie. all the changes you sent me) into its remote acked list, and sends the revocation preimate.
When a node receives the revocation preimage, it copies its remote unacked list (ie. all the changes it send in step 3) into its local acked list.
The two lists ensure that every change gets applied first on the recipient node, then on the proposer node. There are various ways for an implementation to optimize this of course.
Here’s a case, where they both offer an HTLC at the same time, then commits fly back and forth until they’re both in sync again:
Fee negotiation is a little weird: I have no real interest in what fees the other node’s commitment pays (within reason), but I need to keep fees on my commitment competitive, in case I need to drop the transaction to the blockchain. So unlike HTLCs, they’re not symmetrical.
We fit “fee change” messages into the same yours-then-mine model by ignoring their fee changes when applying changes to our own commitment transaction (technically, we only apply fee changes from the acknowledged set). So we send a fee change like any other change, send the commit, and then when the other side commits, that’s when we finally adjust our own commit transaction’s fee. Fortunately, fee changes should not be very common:
Fee changes following the same flow as other changes.
Ouch My Brain!
Wait, is that an acked or unacked change!??!
There have been several wrong turns in this design; it went through several iterations using explicit ack numbers before I was convinced they were unnecessary. My implementation had a bug when commit messages crossed over which was so confusing I had to go back to first principles; it’s also been a source of confusion on the mailing list.
It’d be easy to blame new baby and lack of sleep, but the truth is that protocols have to be simple enough to implement badly: they will be anyway!
Implementing this in my prototype is the final issue for the 0.3 release, which already has a codename thanks to Braydon Fuller…

Well I have only the French economist as source, BTW it doesn't change a lot of things if it was 30 or 40 %...
Here in France we have 50 % and it will not be a game changer (at least without **proper** structural/fiscal reforms).
Does your source take in account the Russian sanction against Europe as a retaliation ?
It was in 2012 well before the Russian retaliation !
So we are probably at 30 % not 40 % !
Germans can export very well with an Euro at 1.40 so making the devaluation argument void.
The countries who have their own currency are pegged to the Euro so your argument is totally void here.
**This is not a problem of a strong currency rate, it's a structural reforms and fiscal reforms one.**

It's an optimization that make you consume less energy for the same hashpower... Like a cheat code in an RPG...
There is two methodologies for doing it:
Covert AB and Overt AB.
Covert AB are miners who use it in secrecy and can't be easily detected while overt is doing it in transparency...
The problem isn't AB per see but the fact that it's a patented technology by Bitmain which give them an (unfair) advantage against other miners and make centralization more problematic.

Broken English ? Or just some rending comprehension problem ?
1) China has better hardware indeed (thanks to cheap local labor while combining foreigner expertise in chips designing.)
2) China have bad connectivity mainly because of the Great Firewall.
3) It's a negative from the outside, a positive if Jihan want to make ChinaCoin as they may separate (even if the GF was not a problem BTW).
The problem isn't good hardware or the GF per se but the concentration of power in the hand of few mainly Jihan's Wu cartels. I consider bitcoin broken at this stage SW2x is just a last attempt for CEOs and cartels to consolidate their power on the whole network. (The goal is to fire Core devs and replace with puppet devs that will bend over to all their silly demand).
Best way is to split and move our ways those two visions (Cypherpunk ideals and Corporate PayPal coin ) are mutually excluding, so it's time for a divorce either with UASF, change PoW HF, refusing the 2x HF part of SW.
Centralized crypto meant the idea is dead, Satoshi ain't foresaw that well...

Unpopular reforms but necessary in the long term to gain competitiveness.

I think the word "democracy" doesn't have the same meaning in US than in Europe:
I will try to break down:
In Europe democracy is something very statist: People vote elected representative who apply a political program and those who won impose their view on the other (even if the other is 49.9 % !)
In US, I think "democracy" is a more libertarian concept, people have the power over themselves not coming from goverment or others people.
Democracy is a Greek word meant "power to the people" the problem is the word "people" it's the collective or the individual will ?
Hope it was clear.

My bad you may have right :)
It would better to have it in the block rewards, but I think lightning is unavoidable in the long run for scaling up.
Or maybe a system that include LNs earnings in block rewards much like dashcoin with it's masternode ?
Making LNs functions in the core protocol and making those earnings in block rewards ?
Some ideas to explore.

When I think it's here that guys like Bastiat and Tocqueville was born...
This measure is meant to *protect us^TM* from Islamic terrorism (after the Charlie Hebdo event in early January).
Of course you can't fund terrorism with 1000 Euros in cash ! s/ while those terrorist got a 6 k€ loan on a bank and paid their AK47 on black market which you can get for no more than 300-500 Euros.
Speculation are that banks are virtually insolvent, so this is the perfect excuse to avoid big withdrawals on banks in case things goes south.
Perfect excuse for tracking the payment by the *Fisc* (our equivalent of your IRS) where France is the most taxed country of the world with more than 55 % of it's GDP. Small business owner getting crushed by SS taxes such as *RSI* who eat up between 47% and 55 % of their profit, two of them suicide each day.
Notice that wealthy Chinese use cash to buy luxury stuff, this measure will hurt our luxury market at Paris.

Actually you need to raise fees and/or the TPS (blocksize).
0.61 % of the reward according to blockchain.info come from fees.
One could have a 20 MB blocks and raising 10 times fees (no doubt Bitcoin will be more a settlement network than a coffee spending network).
Hell even at 200 MB blocks (more than enough to handle the world with fully deployed LNs) you can have the same fees as today.
Without counting that mining equipment will be more and more efficient (reducing electricity cost).
So, it's not big deal, again no need to print.

Wow interesting, I really believe that LN and TN will help scaling to a great extent, you can't have Visa scale (not even PayPal scale) with only blocksize raising.

Why you want remove the discounting ? The discounting is to incite people to use SW since its more efficient not for helping some conspiracy like the "blockstream agenda". 
BTW, it's false to say that Blockstream plan to market those feature, since they will be open source and can be freely copied and used... So the conspiracy Blockstream lock up the network for selling his product doesn't make sense at all. Even about LN, there is at least something about 4 implementations of them !
To finish like I said once all the technical solutions will be used to scale without raising the block size, that same block size will be probably raised after maybe something like 2-4-8, I hope that the problem of the great firewall and Chinese mining concentration will be solved too :)

@_date: 2015-11-08 15:45:06
The most important differentiating things (from Paypal ) ?
I will be short but clear.
1) Transaction Censorship Resistance (it goes as far to be able to do DNM's things without being worried).
2) Strong decentralization (no data centers but a lot of small nodes and miners, preferably thousands of relying nodes.)
3) Tor friendly (well it come with censorship resistance... )
4) Anonymity (CoinJoin alike protocol enabled by default in core and SPV wallet...)
5) The 21 millions supply cap should NEVER be removed even if God himself told us to remove it !
Well, it's short and not so argumented but clear of what about Bitcoin was supposed to be (at least when I became a bitcoin/crypto fanatic since two years now... :)
@_date: 2015-11-28 18:38:01
Then we are fucked,
processor speed are at maximum because of transistors switching time, heat and more importantly the (inverse) relation between frequency and the chip size...
Above 3 GHZ you start to have problems, because of the speed of light (a signal is too slow to reach the other side of the chip.)
The solution would be reducing the size again but we are approaching the limit of downsizing. (The limit is about 1 nanometer or 1 atom in size !)
Like I said, silicon tech is at max, a new whole kind of materials and architecture must be created !

The point about the discount is probably to incite the use of the SW part.
The SW is more efficient than the simple P2P transaction anyway.
Since we know it's delusional to scale only onchain in P2P mode especially for low value and coffee transaction they probably need incentive to use LN which is perfectly normal block-size is also a security parameter which can't be fully put in hand of market forces IMO. 
Also simply raising the blocksize doesn't make progress at all: no SW, no malleability fix, no LN, no CT, no nothing, we just get the same BTC with two times more transaction: boring as hell :(
Also you are wrong, Blockstream will sell services around LN and sidechains but like I said will not make profit out of the tech itself. Maybe they will run nodes too, but it will be so easy to run LN nodes that there is no risk that the "evil" Blockstream get a monopoly on that market.
@_date: 2016-05-16 17:01:27
Well we will see, but I still "trust"  far more BTC than ETH...
Aside that you know, I am fairly allergic to inflation be it low or high :)
ETH have a 15 seconds mining at 5 ETH per block apparently which make:
Let's say a supply of 100 millions ETHx1000 = 100 billions USD...
((4x15x5 ETH)x60x24x365) = 157 680 000 ETH per year...
In USD 157 680 000 ETHx1000 = 157.68 Billions USD yearly...
So you have right that percentage wise, the inflation rate will tend to zero but you would still need 157 Billions of expanding economy each year to just maintain the value at 1000 USD ! If not you will start to see inflationary effect. Bad store of value...

You can't sacrifice decentralization, make the base layer insecure with bigger blocks just to accommodate more users and mooning the price. It's not the point of Bitcoin ! So you will never see 100 MB blocks ! At most maybe 4 or 8 MB.
Also you forget all the improvement that Core propose such as Schnorr signature and so on to increase the number of transaction without increasing the block size !
Efficiency first !
Without counting any potential new techs and discovery in the future that could improve the transaction throughput without increasing the blocksize.

Tried with Tor and Electrum:
Ran Tor browser then changing Electrum parameters:
SOCKS5 with SSL
localhost and port 9150.
It connect well and works, thanks.
I've tried also with a simple (level3, it seems that level2 are anonymous but can leak IP) SOCKS5 + SSL proxy.
*Edit: Bitcoin dev and apps dev should focus more and more on anonymity and making it easy for the noobs to use, to be frank I don't care so much about sending BitSat in space, there is far more anonymity/privacy concern to solve before that.*
*The Chainanalysis story is a reminder that those problems must be addressed in priority.*

@_date: 2016-07-03 09:12:45
I think yes (they are fabricated but by legitimate transactions) it's a testnet after all, in theory we can go up 4 MB, so if you want bigger block, better to upgrade and make SW transactions :)

What give bitcoin a value is if people want to buy it and hodl itl in this it's a stoe of value... actually the economic activity on BTC is weak and was always weak, it was always the store of value case that ma de BTC useful and popular not coffees transaction... in this sense according to your logic it's already a pump and dump scheme expect that nobody dump...
The people who buy at 3 K doesn't care about coffees trans and fees...
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:50:20
Gamable system, it will remove the ability for nodes to verify in teh long run and will end up in a corporate/goverment controlled coin this is not bitcoin anymore but an alt. Please sell and go ETH it suit better your needs.

We will move out of legacy transactions for SW ones in the future, we keep them to avoid break compatibility and keep some special use cases but in reality it will be better to go on SW addresses...
Thus your whole argument above break down...
If you speak about Flex Trans that things was already vetoed by the specialists as not a viable alternative. By the SW have more and more chance to get activated especially with the SW2X (but no sure about the 2X HF part as all full nodes need to upgrade to avoid orphan the miners)..

It will be ugly when they will see 1 USD fees on chain and how to scale that on chain without forgetting that the ETH network is already fairly centralized...
It will just prove the point of small blocker and SW supporter, its just a matter of time...
When nobody use a chain of course you can yell at the entire crypto economy that you have the lowest fees, but as soon the chain is used it completely another story...

We are pleased to announce myself Jihan from BitMain, The PBoC and the president of China Xi Jinping the creation of ChinaCoin a direct fork of Bitcoin:
The main features will be:
1) Bigger blocks so that you can trust us to verify in our specialized data centers in Sichuan.
2) Lack of privacy totally transparent. (A SF will be later discussed to add KYC AML on protocol level).
3) Centralized in our Chinese data-centers so that we can better protect you and your money.
4) Trust our qualified team of CEOs, politicians and the Chinese State, we want harmony and progressing toward a ~~dystopian~~ prosperous future.
We will fork ourself the 1st August from Bitcoin our new ticker symbol will be CCC for (Central China Coin)...

@_date: 2017-06-16 14:19:07
4 MB is the max of the max to stay somewhat safe (in reality isn't safe at all you don't have security margin anymore, the smaller the blocksize the better obviously.) Actually nodes count goes down even with 1 MB limit ! We are near the redline.
For Core you are right they can't force consensus change but a majority of people only run Core for obvious security (and sometimes ideological) reasons that's why it's DOA. To be successful you need +7000 Core nodes upgrading at the same time, not gonna happen...
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:28:06
It need a minimal amount of hashpower to bootstrap the thing but doesn't the a huge majority... You teach me nothing new here...

@_date: 2017-06-06 19:55:49
I am a UASF supporter but the more time I think and wait the more I think nothing particular will happen, here my reasons:
1) Price will approach or could be well above 3000 USD in August !
2) If BU/Jihan/Roger couldn't do jack shit with nearly 40 % hashrate and massive propaganda then I am not sure about UASF either...
3) Bitcoin seems to be ossified, status quo is the best compromise and it show to the market that it's extremely difficult to get your way, so no BU, no SW, no HF, No BarryCoin, No BIP148, nothing !
4) Economic actors won't take the risk to fuck up +3000 USD/coin, that including Jihan, Roger, exchange and even SW supporting pools, even Core is conservative !
5) Fees ? Who care about them ! Store of value and digital gold is more important than fees and scaling, Investor want 3000, 4000, 5000, 10 K and so on...
6) Bitcoin work perfectly as is even without SW...

Once again o don't care and this is not because they say that and are centralized cartels that what they said is always good or true I still can think by myself...
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:51:56
Your node need to send back that at least 8 times meaning the upload is also a problem.
Also not everyone is a privileged with a high speed internet... Even those who are privileged may have data caps... 
Also it's not because you can do that, that's a reason to bloat the chain in long run this is untenable, nobody run full nodes and verify on ETH already, they do just the pruned version they can't even sync anymore... It's already dead.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:16:40
Color me shocked ! Miners who mine BU are either outright bribed or threatened that they will not get mining gear if they don't comply ! That's why we need ASICs manufacturing decentralization ASAP !
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:07:47
I wholly agree, like you said especially if we HF to the 2/8 MB limit we won't see any on chain increase for a foreseeable future maybe in decades ! 
Transaction compression is the way to go (more transactions for the same amount of block size). Anyway regarding SW2x I am more like in wait and see approach...
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:25:41

Well it's a Chinese cartel so I don't trust them (actually you shouldn't trust anybody since it's... Bitcoin...), anything can happen and for the HF part if Core and Nodes aren't on board it won't happen or we will get two coins (ChinaCoin and CoreCoin)...

No at all, it was proven that 8 MB is unsafe...
Keep in mind you need to relay 8 times the block to send back the block to the distributed network...
Also keep in kind that the UPSTREAM is more important than the downstream...
Keep in mind that even with the 1 MB block nodes count decreased years after years even if the global user count went up exponentially...

In a pyramid scheme you promise insane returns and you pay interest with other people money... You can speak about a speculative value but not at all a pyramid scheme !
Also being a simple store of value to hedge against fiat debasement is already a use case, thus this simple fact disprove your theory about Bitcoin being a pyramid scheme if its used only a store of value or speculation tool !

You can put more transactions in SW resulting the same as raw blocksize increase (if you use SW address) !
If you READ my message I said the effective block size is increased (more transactions) and in absolute even the normal block size is raised too (we get block up to 4 MB for normal SW and 8 MB for SW2X !)

@_date: 2017-06-06 23:00:56
Yes he block SW, but he will never push more than he does actually his contentious ideas (BU, EC and so on) why ? Because it would be split and utter destruction of confidence in BTC and bye bye 3 K price ! Same shit for UASF, that's why the more I think, nobody will jump too much risk to fuck up 3 K price and more !
So status quo will prevail, nobody from either camp want fuck the 3 K USD and market confidence, I just realized it was bluff and childish play...

I don't have answer you need to do a paper about that... Far less than GB size of block anyway.
If you want number that bad the inventor of LN said that with 133 MB block you can handle the whole world every 6 months...
So if you want handle 1 %  but 6 times more (since you do it every month you need (133/100)*6 = 8 MB.
Like I said not everything will be on LN a mix of sidechain, LN, on chain transaction compression will need to be explored, that was always the plan even small safe block increase...
Pure on chain VISA scale is: with 1 MB = 3 Tps then going VISA is 1 GB blocks at best remember that VISA is just a little part of the world population and everyday transactions !

Second: ETH is locking up supply via ICOs it will be a blood bath when those ICOs want cash out: meaning it's all paper profit.

I can confirm about saving "face" is very important out there. The end result is that people can become fake or fake things a lot...

Not sure if you are serious or Trolling.
**TLDR: BITCOIN IN DATA CENTER IS ABSOLUTELY FUCKING USELESS !!!**
**BETTER USE PAYPAL.**

Fees doesn't matter for the guy who buy 10 K, 100 K or the hedge funds who buy 10 millions... really
This is those guys who prop the price... Investor want store of value not coffees transactions ! They want stable and secure protocol, they want immutability, they want censorship resistance, they want decentralization not a forkshitcoin not a coffee shit chain !
They won't feel shit about 10 USD fees even 100 USD ones...
So it's not important for the price and success of BTC really !
The balance is well know my friend: If you trade low fees and usability you will trade of decentralization and security, small users care about fees, but in reality investors doesn't care so much (big holder, saver and trader).

The HF part won't happen if everyone isn't on board including the 7000 Core nodes... Or it will be a split one with China coin the other with cypher punk coin... Since nobody want to realistically split the HF will be the next scaling ~~war~~ "debate" after SW is activated....

They want to turn BTC into shit aka ETH, hell even ETH would be lass bloated...
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:52:08
You have to think in adversarial condition: so taking 8 MB as the value to do an analysis is the way to go...
I wouldn't hire you as security researcher in my company...

Freedom is an illusion ? WHAT the actual fuck !
Then go ETH or any centralized shit little slave, fucking Troll !

Individual nodes SHOULD relay block, because bitcoin isn't about trusting miner to do it for you ! What is this BU logic ?
Then you need TRUST if you let other do it for you !
You excuse about SPV is wrong, it's not because of SPV, it's because that running a full nodes is already complicated and resourceful for the average Joe...
Big blocker want to make more complicated by going insane big block...
Anyway you are wrong on how Bitcoin incentive work.

They are so close (even sometimes physically !) that it's indeed the same...
Same shit with Facebook and all those shit.

I won't run an alternate client, I will support the HF if serious data show that it doesn't threaten decentralization long term...
This is why I say its DOA because the 90% of Core nodes won't upgrade and many companies and users said that they won't run anything else but Core. I am "fine" with SW2x as long I can run BIP141 Core client if not, they should not waste their time on that agreement anymore and stay status quo...
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:07:28
Its YOU who think that, you say nothing here...
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:28:24
Well I plan to put in cold storage and wait what happen, then split on the clearly wining chain some time after, it's the safest to do I Think...
I just think nothing will happen even as a supporter, let's be rational one minute, if BU with 40 % hashrate and massive propaganda couldn't do jack shit then how something like UASF could do something ?
Bitcoin is fine with status quo anyway, we should just enjoy the 2400 USD price :)

Euro felt from 1.40 to 1.10...
And it's only the nominal EURUSD ratio !
Take the effective exchange rate (counting USD inflation) and it's probably worse...

And ? It doesn't matter ? Or as a good socialist you think it doesn't matter because he earn more than one million and "he have enough", so he need to pay his "fair share" ? Fucking disgusting !

Keep parroting your nonsense, SW is fucking ready it's only blocked for politics... What chain slipt ? Eh ? HF will do one buddy, LMAO !

Wait if Jihan and big dickers will fuck her definitely beyond repair... 
If so, dump her instantly by SMS !

SW is already a block increase. 2 (or up to even 4 !) MB &gt; 1 MB last time I checked.
It's just big blockers playing semantics and politics especially that in SW there is no block size anymore but a block weight !
