But you were willing to study as new technology came around. First computers, then bitcoin. You adapted and Trump and the rest of the boomer yuppies arent adapting
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:33:52
Its both. But i believe they will go up, so its a gamble with good odds.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:11:45
Youre even buying at current price? Jeez . I dont feel too bad now. I bought into them all at about 14,2 BTC. Next ill pick up some Bitcoin Cash.

These are the first real “stocks” ive held. Different from animal crossing. Its a rollercoaster watching the prices. What a wild ride. 14k is a good bitcoin price for sure.

Coinbase pro has zero fees on limit orders, and it is free and fast to send Bitcoin and Ethereum to my Ledger Nano S or anywhere.

Now its clear that the whales are just dumping and milking the dump while theyre at it. I wish they would quit. This isnt even weak hands at this point it is just the freaking whales.

Do just a LITTLE bit of logarithmic math.
A year ago the price was 1k.
Recently the price went to 19k, exceeding the straight logarithmic line from 1k to 10k.
Next year it will be 100k, the year after that 1m. At the least.
Whats with all these new accounts spreading fud and pooing all over?

8700 currently 
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:47:59
Todays bitcoin price hardly matters. It dropped from 8000 to 7500. So what if it falls 3%, by the year 2021 btc will be 1,200,000 each. Buy it now while its low. Why people are selling bitcoin i have no idea. Short selling sure, but not holding any btc? Crazy mistake.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:14:40
This isnt a crash at all. Btc will continue to go up. Right now i think its mostly the whales though. The weak hands people sold a while ago. Now it feels like manipulation not weak hands.

Ive never even sold bitcoin. Only buy. Dont care about day trading, gambling on ups and downs.
Generally bitcoin is going up. I have bought low.

So Bitcoin is supposed to be the currency of the future, but buying bitcoin in Coinbase takes over a day. Currency transfers shouldnt take a day or 5 days. My two cents.
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:24:55
It could, but didnt

Weve passed 10k is people pumping or they really getting into it? Thats the question 
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:56:43
Why are you guys selling? How am i supposed to buy a house with a 12 car garage but only buy 6 cars, if you keep selling?

Hi im complete noob and got excited about bitcoin and crypto so i found its easy to buy on Coinbase and bought about $2000 worth on there, now im wondering should i move the BTC and LTC and Ethereum to a wallet for safe keeping or is coinbase safe?
