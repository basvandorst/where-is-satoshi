How have I never seen this vid before? It's freaking amazing

What if you sell it all and then it jumps to $30k/coin? Sell off your investment (ie if you bought 1 coin at $9200, sell half of a coin to get your $9200 back) and let the rest potentially keep growing. If it does crash, then you can put in the $9200 you sold off back into the market.

Does this include GDAX as well?

But the point of bitcoin IS to use it as currency :(

A correction. We're still up 40% for the month, but those gains were far too high to be stable

Hey, could I have one? Thanks

I'm having a hard time figuring out what you're trying to say tbh

To this day I'm still kicking myself for not buying when it was $500/ea. I'm still in college and couldn't be bothered to spend that kind of money. So sad I could have nearly $20k to my name!

Good luck affording upkeep, storage, etc

Where can I purchase Ripple without waiting forever to authenticate? I signed up on Bitstamp a week ago and I'm still waiting on verification... It seems like Changelly doesn't have Ripple on it at the moment either.

Except I had the money and I'm just a cheap ass

Isn't that what a mutual fund more or less is?

The correction I want is a dip back below 10k long enough for me to invest in more than 0.05 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:09:14
TIL I was supposed to know what (5000/20,000)*23,000 was in 1st grade. I don't think you learn multiplication till like 3rd
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:04:54
I know I was making a joke LOL
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:03:44
I'm tempted to buy since we're at a pretty steady low point, but have good feeling we'll see a significant drop after the new year from everyone cashing out and avoiding this years' taxes

Why don't you deposit funds onto Gdax so the buy/sell is instant and there isn't any fee?

Actually £1 ~ .000067314 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:12:56
Honestly really hoping for a 10k+ dip so I can afford to buy even 0.05 BTC

Could say the same damn thing for a lot of stocks that have surged in the last 10 years...ffs
@_date: 2019-02-10 02:46:45
But like how much did those miners cost? Whats the ROI on those?

The fact she seems annoyed about how slow the machine is bugs me. That's like 3x faster than an atm takes!

Gif still relevant but going the other direction ;)
