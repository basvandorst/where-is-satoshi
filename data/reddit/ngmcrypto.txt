I had journal when I started out (digital) tracking my trading idea and when I would have executed a trade.  At the start, I made mistakes roughly 75% of the time and this is coming from someone with a decent amount of experience trading stocks.  Moral of the story- it takes time to learn and even then it's a lot of luck and trolling for news.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:13:53
Don't do it.  Experienced day trading takes time.  Instead of using cash just keep a journal.  You will not get the rush feeling with $30 anyway.  
Seriously though, I wouldn't jump into day trading until you at least learn how the exchanges work and can read charts incredibly well and even then spend about 100 hours watching charts before day trading.  Even then, I wouldn't do it unless you are prepared to lose &gt; 51% of the time.

My target is 19k so not too far off from yours.  I am getting pretty worried about the futures trading come the 10th though and am seriously considering selling everything on the 9th.  Not sure what to do to be honest...I have traded stocks for 10 years (actively and passively but mostly passive) and nothing I learned during that time is helping me accurately predict what will happen which is both exciting and frightening at the same time.

Bots have literally cost people millions though as creators are still optimizing them.  I wouldn't use a bot (I have a Masters in Software Engineering and have read some of the code- NO WAY I would trust my money with them right now).

This only works when transaction are fast which is why it is impossible to do right now or in the near future and when it is the exchange rates will become much less in their divergence.  The only upside is bringing in fiat and buying which is why having money exchanges in your portfolio is a good thing.

Either before the bitcoin futures launch or shortly after.  One or the other is going to win and win huge (or lose and lose big).

If you know the relative password strength (letters / numbers / special characters / length max), you can crack it given enough time assuming 8-10 characters you can crack it in-between a few hours and 2-3 months if you brute force it.

It comes down to how much this run-up is to short the market on the 10th and/or 18th.  It is a huge gamble either way and, frankly, no idea what will happen.

You can setup alerts on CoinBase that do push notifications to your phone and then setup Stop Market / Limit orders to protect gains on GDAX (Google: "transfer funds from CoinBase to GDAX"- if you aren't doing this you are wasting a lot of money in fees).  
That said, flash crash can happen and cost you dearly.  Moral of the story either hodl and walk away for a few weeks, setup push notifications and watch market trends, or watch the charts constantly.  Or a mixture of the three like many are doing in this thread- myself included.

We have until: "The Cboe Futures Exchange plans to offer trading in bitcoin futures beginning 6 p.m. ET Sunday." to formulate a strategy.  Good luck :)
Re losing six figures: I hear you.  I have a good job too and my life wouldn't change much but it sure would sting a few days!
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:29:37
Got it and yes that is possible.  We are on the same page now :)  I am headed to South Korea next weekend and get the feeling on the ground- should be interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:21:27


Correct.  With focus on "huge"
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:16:10
There are ways around it: 
That said, GDAX is probably as good as it gets in the US with Bittrex as your best bet for Alts (which no one is buying atm due to BTC rise). 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:18:26
Flip a coin.  Literally no one on this thread, or in the world excluding a few key players, either know what will happen or have the ability to move the market in a way that impacts the result of the futures market.

This is entirely false information that the community keeps spreading for literally no reason.  Your digital assets are insured.  I have no idea why the community keeps pushing these lies.

Depth chart is really something to watch tonight.  Exciting times for Bitcoin.

CoinBase guarantees market sells for high fees so in an event of a flash crash you could actually ensure a buyer.  That said, there is no "best" exchange.  The blow will impact everyone- if there is one. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:24:22
CoinBase does Market sales for high fees.  You are 100% safe selling there in a flash crash at a high premium.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:09:51
Hold coin on GDAX or CoinBase if you want to actively trade it.  Anyone telling you that is a bad idea has no idea what they are talking about.  You are insured and the majority of their coins are stored offline.  With TFA, you are better off, in almost all cases as a new investor, to use those exchanges.  All the fear posts I read on hear only apply to exchanges that are not insured and in those cases they are 100% right.
Offline wallets are to Hodl not to trade with.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:52:25
There have been cases, in a flash crash, where they get filled in ways you wouldn't expect at non-market values.  CoinBase hasn't had any reports of similar issues.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:41:03


Says the market leaders, the general consensus on bitcoin threads and, more importantly, common sense based on how incredibility speculative this market is and how much news HUGELY impacts movement.  This cannot be understated.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:21:06
Remember when you are sleeping someone else is waking up who views the market different than you.  This isn't trading stocks- it's trading against the world 24/7.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:01:48
100% not going to happen.  It's a gamble either way but some will take the gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:20
Futures impact &gt; LN unfortunately on price.  Futures are really the future of our market.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:23:50
Of course you can- people do all the time (myself included).  In times of extreme market fluctuation, storing your coins in a hard wallet is literally stupid IF you use an insured exchange like CoinBase/GDAX and, once again, anyone telling you otherwise has no idea how to trade coins.  Assuming you have Two Form Authentication setup.  With TFA (Google Authenticator), you are more than secure and much better off this way.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:21:11
Google "Bitcoin Futures trading 10th and 18th"
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:31:10
It's up to you.  It is a huge gamble either way.  I have no idea what I am going to do and I cannot give you sound advice and anyone offering to is just pulling it out of thin air at this point.  There are a few key players in the world that could make an actual educated statement because of their holdings or their market manipulation plans and even then their abilities are limited by the holders so yeah- who knows man.  Maybe 50/50 before and after you see the trend.

 "Prohibition of trading is prohibited because it is too restrictive." He said, "We are focusing on finding ways to minimize adverse effects on the financial market."
Sticking with- "not going to happen" 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:59:34


Not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:36:56
No event- 100% speculation right now my friend.  The only pending event is futures trading.  If you believe that is the case then the market play right now is to gain enough coin to impact futures trading.  Literally no one knows what will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:34:36
Yes.  That would hedge on the news while not fully committing you to a potential downswing.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:04:15
A massive rise or a massive correction.  Literally nothing in-between.  You are either going to high-five your friends for an hour or cry for one- tbd.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:48:54
Buy and then place Stop Loss orders to prevent too much downward loss of investment.  Fairly sounds strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:09:30
That is a different debate and a much more reasonable one.
The argument that was made in this post was: "GDAX getting hacked, you'd lose your bitcoins" which is a complete lie.  
Your argument is: "you don't have a sell option immediately in the event of theft causing a market downturn" and that makes sense.  
I don't agree as they store the majority offline so the impact would be negligible (as seen by other multi-million dollar hacks the community brushed off) but you could be right about that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:07:25


Futures will either push a massive spike or massive correction.  Flip a coin and hope (or pray if that is your cup of tea).
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:20:22
You do realize you are in good company.  I took a six week vacation at the end of the year (still on it now) and BTC has pretty much ruined my desire to do anything but watch charts.  At 4k, you should sell enough to cover earnings though (at least that is what the smart money would tell you to do).  I am struggling with selling as well so I hear ya.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:17:20
Yes.  It was hovering around 15.5 and 15 for a few hours.  I almost sold my stack to play the dips but held for America to wake up and thankfully that paid off.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:59:37
CoinBase (moved to GDAX) with TFA (Google Authenticator) is a better choice for active day trading, in a highly volatile markets with high BTC transfer fees and slow transfers at that, than an offline wallet.  This community does a horrible job of educating the public that is using CoinBase and GDAX exchanges.
Your digital assets are insured. I have no idea why the community keeps pushing these lies.
