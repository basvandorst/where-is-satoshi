Not all coins. The newer DAG coins are starting to really leave blockchain in the dust. Maybe it's time to move past the the chain we've been using and transition to something else. No more BCH BS Band-Aids. It's time to really look to the future. The viability of BTC depends on it.

"BTC is kind of like a commodity. Basically, like gold, you hold on to it and sell it when you want.
LTC is more like an actual currency, with fast transactions and low fees"

I really really would like it if the cart could display the total in BTC before you actually place the order. I mistakenly ordered a 680$ card I was only curious about. I hate that this feature oversight make an order cancellation for you.
I will most definately use this payment method in the future.

Laminated paper wallet. Make a few copies, if you have a safe deposit box, keep it there. Otherwise hid a copy in a picture frame at work, or something. Just keep one copy in a separate location.

I have a similar effect, but I refer to it as the "waffle stomp"

Don't forget too well tho. Don't wanna end up like me. Had 45BTC circa 2009/2010 and formatted the HDD with my wallet.
