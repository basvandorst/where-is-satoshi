So what if it encourages address reuse? It fixes the problem of address reuse. Thats like saying segwit is bad because it encourages users to rely on unconfirmed transactions.


The "naming of every txid" would be implicit and ultimately constructed by the validating node by taking advantage of the index. Is the txid not already part of the UTXO database? If so the validating node can construct a list of 1 million txids in milliseconds. Probably only slightly slower than parsing them out of the actual transaction.


There is a few ways around this: Add a new validation rule that only allows a single coalesce per scriptPubKey. Or add another database that tracks coalesces and require new ones to have a higher "sequence". Or require all coalesces to encode the latest block height, and add a block validation rule that requires all coalesces to signal a block no older than 100 blocks or something like that.
Even if the tx was replayed, the money is going to the same place, is it really that bad? The user just has to be made aware of this side effect. The documentation needs to make clear that coalescing transactions should not be used to pay third parties, it should only be used for internal wallet organization.

This is only true if you're reusing address as a sender. It doesn't not apply when you reuse addresses as a receiver. These coalesces are only used by people who reuse addresses as a receiver, which has no effect on fungibility nor privacy. Those who reuse addresses as a sender have no need to coalesce utxos.


Again, this only applies to those who reuse addresses as a sender.

Thats why there needs to be a "coalesce mode" where you can spend all inputs for a given address by just signing one input. This should be possible by indexing the UTXO set by scriptPubKey. This *will* allow you to spend millions of UTXO's with by only adding a single input/signature to the tx.

If you want to consolidate inputs, have a look at BIP131. That will allow you to consolidate millions of inputs into a single UTXO for the cost of a single 250 byte transaction. The only problem is that the BIP was written by a non-blockstream developer, so the current generation of devs won't allow it in the protocol. They prefer their schnoor signature aggregation proposal instead which is won't bring the cost to consolidate a million inputs anywhere near a 250 byte transaction.

Won't that centralize the LN? Layer 1 needs a limit so the cost to run a node doesn't get too high and make it so that only large players can run a node. What makes the LN any different? If a bunch of people flood the LN with payments, won't that increase the amount of bandwidth/CPU needed to run a LN node, thereby centralizing it?

What if the revenue isn't enough to offset the bandwidth costs? If payments are nearly free *and* unlimited, then the cost to run a LN node will go up. This will centralize the network. The cost to run a LN node has to be limited in some way.


It costs more bandwidth to route between many nodes. It takes less bandwidth to route payments through a small number of nodes. The more number of nodes the higher cost to run a LN node. If each node is limited to only connecting to a certain number of nodes, then this will also limit the cost to run a LN node. As you can see, there are multiple ways to limit the cost to run a LN node, but it has to be limited in some way.

Bip131 on the other hand, *is* backwards compatible. Any dust UTXO you have today will be eligible to consolidate via a wildcard input.

There has to be *some* processing cost. I concede that no storage cost is required, but it still takes bandwidth and some CPU to get a payment across the network. You're telling me a LN node can process thousands of payments per second and not use *any* CPU/bandwidth? I'm pretty sure that violates the laws of information theory.
The fact remains. If an unlimited Layer 1 in centralized, then a unlimited layer 2 is also centralized. In order for LN to be not centralized, a transaction limit must be placed on each layer 2 node.

This means if you're using an older version of a bitcoin wallet, you won't be able to use flip.me until you upgrade. Older wallets ca not send to bech32 addresses. Bech32 is a hard fork.
