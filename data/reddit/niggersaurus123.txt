I don’t think I saved the key. I still have my old phone so I have perfect access to my bittrex account..plus I don’t have any holdings in my wallets which is good lol. Would I be able to call them to deactivate it?

I’m not to sure maybe 7500 at best..but I am extremely positive about a huge correction that will come after the fork. Everyone will sell afterwards, and dump their hodlings back into alts:)

Well damn...I hope those home renovations appreciate the value of your home to par with what you would have made with bitcoin;)

Wait till after the fork. It’s inevitable that the price will drop, and anyone who argues against that is simply acting ignorant.

Or they will all sell, driving the price down. Your statement is not wrong but it can also go the other way.

Still excellent news none the less!

Thanks guys! I’m going to order a trezor:)

For sure man! But the more we see, the more the public becomes aware and more interested! 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:48:53
Sell now buddy! Everyone’s buying back into alts!

Is it crashing? I mean...it's up $1000+ last month....
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:28:57
Yes it’s great but don’t forget after the fork, it’ll drop just was fast as it rose. Have no fear, corrections are necessary to ensure bitcoins full potential. MOON soon!

Buddy..you asked a question and he answered it. Quit being paranoid and download the damn wallet...unless you'd prefer losing all your bitcoin.

Positive buddy! Personally I use electrum which is pc only..but for android, I'd highly recommend breadwallet
