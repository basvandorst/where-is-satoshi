Do you have a time-frame for this being implemented?
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:07:27
Thank you for this.  FBAR is a bear, and it is really broadly written.  It's hard to believe what our Congress has done to force Americans to disclose their finances to our government. 
For those of you that doubt, do a google on FBAR and read the regs for yourself.  From my reading the prosecutions are spotty, but who wants to take a chance?

Thank you for the tip!

Contact your bank immediately.
I had sent two wires during the second half of February.  Gox's bank, on its own, contacted one of my banks and asked whether I wanted the money back.  I said yes, asking only that they let me know if there were going to be fees in excess of 100 USD.  I'm waiting for that.  My other bank (a credit union, actually) already put the funds back in my account.
I raised the issue with both of my banks only last week.  I should note that the first bank ignored my messages and appears to have acted only based on the communication from Gox's Japanese bank.  Still puzzling over that one.
I also suggest stating to your bank that the recipient of your wire has applied for bankruptcy protection, they are not operating, and you have no indication that the funds were credited to your personal account (assuming that to be true, of course).
Good luck!
P.S. The irony of the situation (reversing a financial transaction) is not lost on me.

I concur. If you file, and it costs only a few bucks, you can discuss it openly--more or less--because you have a year to file a real patent application which will cost $$.  The provisional disclosure has to be in enough detail that someone reasonably skilled in the art could take your disclosure and build your concept without asking you any questions.

Ah... the light is dawning... like an escrow account.

Crap.  Total crap:
*"Mook invented the computer based cash register in 1985 as well as a golf ball that changes color in 1990, so we do not take his price projections lightly, nor does this magazine endorse them."*

Gambling.  Full stop.  Just with BTC to make it seem sexy.

Hi there,
If you are in Kuwait and speak Arabic, perhaps you can get ahold  of a report I've been looking for for quite some time.
I tried calling Markaz from Dubai but had no luck.

The overlay here is that Mr. K was sitting on several million in cash deposits.  The Japanese court might decide that those guys get preference.  I hope not, but it is possible.
I'd make the argument that if there was a pro rata distribution it ought to treat cash and btc separately.  As of Gox closing, those who wanted cash, had cash in their account, and those who wanted BTC had BTC in their accounts.
Where it falls apart is that the price on Gox was not a fair market price and had not been for a few weeks before Gox closed.

Putting it into your business account may make for an interesting time for your business tax filings... I gently suggest you spend some money on good tax advice!
But regardless, congratulations!
I did early mining in 2010 and gave up as I had technical problems beyond me at the time.  Only jumped in in 2013.  Still happy with that.

I don't envy the moderator having to deal with this.
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:27:19
Thank you very much for the offer.  Greatly appreciated.  They both have androids, but I think I can live without the daily limit--as mentioned  elsewhere in this sub, my primary concern was about theft, rather than limiting their daily spend--I trust them in that regard.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:32:18
I was actually more worried about their wallets being compromised, and wanted to limit potential damage.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:29:43
Maybe that's really the point of my post.  I'm reasonably savvy but this seems very complicated, and I think there is a place for managed BTC wallets for children.
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:35:26


Thank you. I will study up on this.
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:36:04
In my case I did it completely conscious of the risks.  Same reason I played a bit with bitcoinbuilder.  Risk vs. reward.

The U.S. does not have VAT.
@_date: 2014-03-12 09:31:14
Well, we finally have a statement under oath from Mr. K.  Here's the important bit, IMHO:


investigations discovered a loss of 744,408 bitcoins presumably from this method of theft. These events caused among others MtGox to become insolvent and to file the Japan Proceeding."*
So he either actually believes this or he is fibbing under oath...  
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:28:23
Thank you both.  I will take a look at this idea.  That seems pretty practical.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:26:51
If I had to rank my concerns, my primary concern is about backing up the wallet.  I'd rather not lose BTC to inexperience or simple error.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:55:19
"Value-Added" tax is based on the difference between what you paid for a product and what you sold it for, where a "Sales" tax is only based on what you sold it for.
Now if the UK/EU tax authorities tried to apply VAT to BTC, that would be unfortunate.  Personally, I don't think it is likely.  There is no transformative step when one buys and sells BTC, which is normally what is looked at for VAT.  What would be the "value add"?

Actually, I was pleasantly surprised at how good Earl Grey iced tasted.  They even had agave sweetener instead of sugar.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:47:10
Um... The U.S. does not have VAT.
Moreover, paying tax is incumbent on each taxpayer.  
The only implication I can see is certainty regarding tax treatment.  That is, BTC will now be treated the same as gold for U.S. taxpaying purposes.
P.S.  I've always thought VAT was a particularly onerous approach to structuring taxes.  So much paperwork and reconciliation!

I'm actually a patent attorney.  I thought about that as I do have friends in incubators, but I dislike business rule patents.  And I just want someone to build it.  But I do appreciate your kind words!

I've done a little investing with them.  My biggest issue is lack of responsiveness in the arbitration process.  I've asked many, many times for contact information for their legal department and they just ignore my emails.

Note that the percentages lost are virtually identical.

Are you thinking the plate could attract a kidnapping or something?
@_date: 2015-10-10 08:33:26
Undoubtedly.  But they also were of the opinion that nothing of value would come of my little mining experiment.  That still may be true given that this is a kickstarter project.
@_date: 2015-03-29 09:38:07
I'm not much for traditional gambling, but I have been trying BTCjam which is a platform for cloudsourcing bitcoin loans.  The trick is to try to figure out whether the borrower is (1) at all trustworthy and (2) is using it for something that seems likely to produce enough to pay back the loan.  The payback comes slowly over time, but it definitely a gamble with some skill involved.  Just got burned a bit too.  Something like this would not be possible without BTC.  And it is a bit of fun.
(Disclaimer: I have no interest in BTCJam--this topic just reminded me of it.)
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:41:19
Thank you.  The mining itself wasn't hard.  It was the process of going from purchasing hardware, setting it up, mining, collecting the coin over time, and spending in a way that helped interesting developers that really appealed to me.
@_date: 2015-10-10 08:34:05
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:39:36
I feel a little uncomfortable shilling.  Like any kickstarter project you never know if they will deliver. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 13:13:26
Yep, you got me.  'Not possible' is too strongly worded.  As I was writing, I was thinking about how easy it was for me to send BTC to my account and how easy it was for the borrower to get the 'money' without any third party other than the website.  More accurately, it seems to me that BTC removed a lot of the friction in this kind of mediated financial transaction.  This was a casual thing for me.  I would not have bothered if I had had to wire money from a bank account.  Put another way, the transaction(s) would not have happened but for BTC because I would not have bothered.
@_date: 2015-10-10 08:39:59
Kinda disagree.  I've gained knowledge regarding the mining pools and also moving btc around.  That was the point of this.  I'm just making use of the output.  Dollar-wise I'm at break even after making this purchase, leaving aside the cost of power.  Well worth it in terms of entertainment and education.
@_date: 2015-03-11 12:38:27
Why travel to multiple locations around the US then?  If they were mining they would pick a location with the cheapest power and scale up there.  And the economics just don't support traditional datacenter rackspace for mining. 
From other reading I understand that 21 is focusing on using BTC as backbone for financial transfers among banks.  This sort of business would require presence in many, many datacenters.
(IMHO the Chinese have mining sewn up.  They source the chips, have access to cheap parts and just set up in warehouses.)
