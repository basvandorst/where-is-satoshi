I think what is most sad is that it's not even deliberate - it's just lazy. A biased figure controlling the reports can be countered; it's much harder to counter apathy.

The neutrality of it all. Historically, fiat money has been disproportionately kept in the hands of certain demographics. As a minority, Bitcoin offers me the same chance to seek my fortunes as everyone else!

Exactly. I'm sure that there could be some big shadowy cartel - IF there was a "need" for one. As it is, the potential powerhouses no more think about controlling the media than most people think about the basis of value in currency. Apathy prevents that need arising.

It is a property of *traditional* capitalism. Bitcoin is nothing if not revolutionary.

When has factual inaccuracy stopped the media?

They can try. Something tells me they won't succeed.

At one point, most people in the WORLD let alone America had no clue what the Internet was. Look how that turned out ;)

Depending on how it would be deployed you could roll your own setup. Assuming it would be placed in a secure, supervised location (e.g. a personal business during opening hours) a DIY setup could work. I've seen a few of these based around a Raspberry Pi (controller), cheap tablet (interface) and a printer feed roll (for dispensing notes). 
Anything above that (e.g. operating outside, etc.) and a DIY option is beyond terrible. Go pro or go home.

That's inevitable in any currency. My point is that with Bitcoin the traditional discrimination with regards to acquiring it vanishes. You'll get a few early adopters who strike it big (as I wish I had done!), but after that it's far more egalitarian.

The lost coins from shoddy units are bad enough. The physical damage is worse - nothing like a small electrical fire to start your day!
