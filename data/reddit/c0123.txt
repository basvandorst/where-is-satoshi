I absolutely agree. It seems more and more we have a culture of TLDR I'll follow what the other people say in everything from politics to where to eat for dinner.

What makes you feel that way, anything outside of the articles linked in my other comment that concerns you?

Hi u/chiraggovind, when I mention the time to transact, I mean to sell and withdraw from an exchange rather than to send someone BTC. The article I linked regarding Bittrex has people saying it is taking 30 days to withdraw their funds and many comments in forums saying that other exchanges are taking 5+ days. How sending someone BTC can be so fast but settling a transaction on an exchange can take so long leads me to believe the comments where people are speculating that some exchanges are funding withdrawals with deposits.

Store of wealth... Maybe vehicle of speculation?

What do you mean by taking care of their money? As in people investing in things they don't understand. Do you think the burn is coming? If so what do you think will be the catalyst.
