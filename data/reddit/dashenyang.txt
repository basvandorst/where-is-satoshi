Union pay is not credit, it's debit.

Most Chinese don't. I don't. It would be such an incredible PITA to get a credit card here in China, and even if I did, it wouldn't be on USD, so would only be useable in China. Also, I try not to use Chinese banks. What am I supposed to do, fly to America to open a credit line, with no address, employment history, bank accounts, etc.? There are plenty of places around the world where credit doesn't exist for most people.

I just signed up from mainland China with 12vpn. $49 for a year, and handles 8 megabits. Most Chinese ISPs only offer 2 or 4, but we recently got the 10Mb fiber connection. Multiple servers around the world to connect through, maybe twenty or so. I usually use Tokyo or Singapore for fast connections. They're based out of HK, so are experts on mainland China and the protocols used here. They support high-speed VPN protocols is you have Win 7 or 8. I've been using for a month now, and haven't had any problems connecting. They accept Bitpay.

Yes, I was aware that they existed. It is, however, still a major pain, and credit cards in china usually require large minimum bank deposits and lengthy applications. They are usually only held by wealthy Chinese who travel abroad, and still tend to have less than ideal terms. Also, people here tend not to trust banks too much, and still prefer cash in their hands. Safes are pretty popular. If or international purchases I'd much rather use bitcoin. As a bonus, it would be great if it could be used domestically, but that won't happen. At least, not for a long, long time.

Is Neusoft China's biggest still then, with Tencent in second place?

I was talking about IT companies though, not payment processors.

Hi, I'm the translator from today's two articles. Learning Mandarin is definitely worth it, even if you just use it to fuck with people at Asian markets. It is, however, almost impossible to pick up the tones unless you have a native speaker to practice with.  The good news is that every university has tons of Chinese students who would love to be your language partner/friend. Good luck learning!
