Just wanna say, I love how the text is justified along the outline of his person in this image. That is some advanced typographic alignment. The one line that follows the contour of his neck, lol

This is a delusional attitude on timing the market. It is very hard to do, and most people lose money when they try. If you made money or know somebody who did, good job. But if that’s your takeaway message, it was from luck and not smarts.

Well that is news to me! Thanks for clarifying. After doing some googlin', I'm guessing you're referring to [this attack](
Fwiw, this is a deliberate man-in-the-middle attack that spoofs the verification sent back to the terminal, and not as simple as the merchant just resubmitting your info for a second transaction as SakamotoDesu suggested above. Please do correct me if I'm wrong, and there's another attack I'm unaware of.
@_date: 2019-08-23 21:12:30
Well that's not a flaw in chip and pin cards then, but on number-and-signature transactions. The second transaction you described is using the card number (not the chip) and a signature (not a pin). In Europe they often _require_ chips rather than card numbers and that's the future of US POS systems as well, making that "attack" obsolete. Which has kinda been my whole point in this thread.

I love Andreas, but this is a childish attitude about messaging. People who haven't even heard the message yet are mostly idiots? You can't expect the public to give even a minute of their time just because some guy on the internet said they should listen or else they're an idiot.
Some awareness about marketing, publicity, even just basic respect for people who aren't internet-bitcoin-heads would go pretty far in this community. If you're trying to expand the bitcoin space, comments like yours are doing the opposite.
@_date: 2019-08-23 20:05:05
If you're evangelizing, you should view downvotes as valuable feedback that your messaging isn't working, _not_ as a sign that the audience are idiots or have a "sheer lack of curiosity". If you don't respect your audience you have no hope of convincing them of anything.
Just like you think that if somebody needs money to live, they should think about money---you should think hard about the best way to communicate. Sorry for being preachy, I'm kinda speaking generally about the bitcoin space here and not just to you. A lot of nerds (and I'm speaking as a big nerd here) really discount the importance of effective communication strategies.

My point is that chip and pin is cryptographically secure and they don't store your private key as was stated upthread. You're describing a flaw in the outdated number-and-signature system, which yes, we all agree is flawed. That's why it's being replaced.
In crypto talk, the attack is "obsolete" because we know the solution to it: just require chip-and-pin. Banks and merchants still using old technology is the sole reason for the problem you've described, not some issue with the chip and pin protocol.
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:39:09
It's worth pointing out that chip-reading credit cards, which are the norm in Europe and quickly becoming so in north america, do _not_ work this way and are in fact cryptographically secure. When paying with a chip, your card keeps its secret key secret, and only gives a signed message to the terminal. The terminal checks that message against e.g. the Visa servers to see if it's a valid signature. The terminal never sees your secret key and your signed message can only be used to validate a single transaction, so the merchant can't rerun your card in the future. This validation step, which keeps your key secret, is actually pretty similar to how a signed blockchain transaction works without the decentralization.
I feel your comments verge on misinformation by painting an outdated picture of credit cards as though that's how they always work.
@_date: 2019-08-23 20:10:09
No, the point is that if you're using the new chip cards that is impossible. The merchant cannot run another transaction because they never saw your private key, but only a public signature from it. And since each public signature is only valid for one transaction (it has a nonce that is checked by e.g. Visa when the transaction is approved) they can't just send it again. You're correct about netflix but that's a separate point.

CSW is claiming  that he has the keys though. He’s claiming that something is true, which would be easily provable if it _were_ true, and there would be no reason for him not to prove it. But he has never been able prove it. If he could, he would, but he hasn’t.
It’s straightforward logic and you’re using faith based reasoning with no basis to trust CSW over any other pretender. Secure proof of identity is _the_ fundamental achievement of cryptography.  His extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence, and he has provided exactly none.
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:36:35
If someone does have the keys it would be easy for them to securely prove it by signing a message. Since nobody has done that, we know that none of the people claiming to be Satoshi actually have the private keys.
Understanding that point is really all you need, to know that Craig Wright and every other fake satoshi are total BS.

You can't just redefine words so they match your agenda. [Investopedia: "Free trade is a policy to eliminate discrimination against imports and exports."]( Trump is instituting new tariffs, which is by definition the opposite of free trade.
Absolutely Orwellian how much you've swallowed the party line. It's tragic irony for somebody who's a self-styled libertarian.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:35:37
The link I provided to Libertarianism.org has a whole section on this, which quotes John Locke and concludes:


I can't say I'm surprised you didn't read it, or know basic libertarian theory.
So how does Trump's trade war and widespread tariffs fit into your free-trade worldview?
@_date: 2019-06-13 01:38:26


You obviously haven't read the article I linked. They don't want that. I'll reiterate: you're delusional. You think you're a better authority on libertarianism than the Cato Institute, and at the same time are unwilling to read what they say. I'm not going to waste any more time on this discussion.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:07:29
Donald Trump, the guy closing borders, bombing Yemen, and escalating trade wars, is the furthest thing from a libertarian. [Libertarianism means open borders and free trade.]( You're a hypocrite, and it's not the liberals spewing nonsense ITT.

There is always a nonzero rate of people simply losing their keys, permanently removing their coins from the circulating supply. That is a deflationary pressure. Whether that rate is faster or slower than the new coins being minted is an open question afaik.

But this isn't frivolous, it's a publicity stunt meant to convince Elon Musk to 1) take on a responsibility he has shown zero interest in ("carrying the trustchain torch"), and 2) make a huge publicity donation to BitPanda.
It's baffling to think that's an appealing offer to Musk. It just looks like the BitPanda CEO has poor judgement and is way over-estimating his position, and this will go nowhere. Makes crypto people seem out of touch and delusional about their own importance.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:03:51


This happens whenever somebody loses their private key, in a hard drive in a landfill for example. There are tons of examples of this happening, and we can assume it is happening all the time. So there's definitely deflationary pressure.
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:58:57


That's objectively not true. I linked an entire fucking _essay_ by _the biggest libertarian thinktank_ that explicitly argues the exact opposite of your position. The fact that you keep insisting that all libertarians agree with you is delusional.
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:18:26
You said,


That's why I referenced the Locke quote, and the excerpt from the CATO institute/libertarianism.org. Libertarians absolutely believe in open borders regardless. At least, the most mainstream libertarian thinktank does!
I agree with pretty much everything in your paragraphs 2&amp;3. 
  &gt;  The commenters posting trash on trump ITT are not libertarian.
I guess my point is that (like you said) Trump isn't a libertarian. He's nowhere close. People like u/BigDickSZN who said,


Are living in fantasy land and don't know shit about libertarianism. Calling yourself a "libertarian" while supporting the guy who is closing borders, opening internment camps, and starting trade wars is a scary level of cognitive dissonance.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:14:09


Trump is not a libertarian. He is closing our borders, starting trade wars, and beating the war drums against Iran. [Libertarianism means open borders and free trade]( and no military adventurism.
You're either deliberately spreading propaganda or you've swallowed somebody else's. Read a little about libertarianism before using that word again.
