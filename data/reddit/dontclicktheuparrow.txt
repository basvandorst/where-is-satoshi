We are literally dust in the wind. The significance you put on your own life and the lives of your descendants is completely meaningless. Let that soak in for a few minutes.

I wonder what all of them going to nothing would do to he global economy? Would countries collapse? Through out history there have been all these major crashes and it's always concerned me because Crypto Crash has such a ring to it.

Just hypothesizing here but there is some chance Trump resigns or gets impeached and I've heard from several people if that happens then the stock market will crash. We have seen the correlation between stock market and bitcoin movements, so is it possible that could do it?

Why isn't this being discussed? We've see that AI can beat poker and professionals have said it's only a matter of time before bots take it over online, would you say it's happening now?

Why do people downvote these posts? Bitcoin is being manipulated by the big players, period. There is no regulation and no way to stop it currently. They make a huge buy and it makes the price go up and then once it's up they sell and double their money, easiest 500 million ever.

Do you know of whales selling off? That would be the only viable info you could have. That huge purchase at the beginning of April is really scary, they could cash out for hundreds of millions right now.

This is a concern in my opinion, if the stock market tanks bitcoin will go right with it. Money will get tight for people and having it tied up in bitcoin will not happen. When the housing market crashed around 2008 you should've seen how tight people were with money.
