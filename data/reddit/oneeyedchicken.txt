One benefit of lighting is it provides a little more privacy than straight btc transactions, (I may be wrong here) but if op sent another tx to torgaurd AFAIK his first payment would be completely hidden from observers that didn't witness it.

The key you mention, is that the physical key that comes with the phone? mine only seems to open the sim card tray. I am not sure if I use it before or after I send the transaction.

Thanks for all the comments everyone. I dont trust paper or flashdrives to last 17 years so think I will etch the priv key onto something and send funds using OP_HODL to that priv keys pub address. Part of the reason is I don't me or anyone else being able to spend the coins before the time.

They could well claim to be Irish but the title has as much sense as saying largest Northern Irish building company and referring to a company from the Republic.

my point was those ledger entries aren't bitcoins, they represent someone having the ability to spend x amount of bitcoin but not bitcoin itself.

It wasn't really stolen from a cold wallet. This is the equivalent of saying: My money was stolen from a bank vault when actually your house had been burgled. Just because it was in the cold storage (which doesn't seem all that cold) at one stage doesn't mean it was stolen from there.

I have researched this quite thoroughly lately and the only conclusion I came to for it to be provably fair is to use a commitment scheme ( among all players. The downside of this is one bad actor can decide not to share their secret after the buy in time has elapsed and the whole lotto is now tainted, ie. impossible to prove the organizer of the draw is not cheating. Would be happy to discuss this more with you if you wanted or if you have any other ideas on making it provably fair. An open source RNG is not provably fair if it is operated by one person.

They don't specifically say Ireland finds co-existing currencies natural just some countries do. Ireland uses the euro exclusively although a few merchants will accept UK sterling but they are generally few and far between.
