Good karma is worth more than $60K (which will soon be worth much less in btc terms)

Borrowed a bit (haha) from this post and used the “bitcoin gray” color hex.
Probably could use some more time on advanced photoshop to get the alignment and details 100%.

Two other points:
First, Gold ETF in early 2000s drove that next bull cycle (no need for physical holdings) and that tech and infrastructure is all built out now...just waiting for approval for a BTC/XBT ETF.
Second, gold is something like -2% TOTAL return since the 70s, while value of a dollar has decreased by say -2% PER YEAR.  So it’s been a good store of value.  Vs BTC as an emerging store of value.  (If anyone can dig up charts on usd index vs gold since 1933 that’d be a useful visual)

Dollar sign has a strike through with a single line but it does look eerily similar ;)

The guys at Delphi Digital have some of the best reports on crypto from a financial/technical perspective, including BTC.

Surprised no one has mentioned Unchained with Laura Shin (she also does Unconfirmed).

Everything is a possible scam.  This is not, however.

Lots of volatility in the $8.1k - $8.6k range...think we may be finding some footing...

How would it work then?

You would probably see a shift in dynamics between where values accrues.  Today we focus on growth and in the future it could be value; ie people would be less willing to spend on things unless they had a uniqueness or value beyond the future value of the underlying currency being paid out.  One must also assume taxes, social services, etc all still exist but are denominated in satoshi, so there wouldn’t be hoarding but it would become a psychological shift.
Couple this with global demographics that aren’t great for growth in the coming decades and it may be necessary to usher in a world where growth/profit isn’t the core goal.
Stocks are much different though, they are based on projected future cash flows of a business or asset discounted back at some risk free rate plus a risk premium.
So if you think a deflationary currency like bitcoin would curb growth then its best to acquire cash flow producing assets that enable long-term value creation (and discourage rent-seeking).  A good example could be acquiring assets in a solar panel producer vs a traditional utility company.

Would be cool to see a piece on human interaction with money/accounting systems over the years.  Like how was it used, by whom, and how did that change over time.  (Could go back thousands of years and pick points in time and societies that are interesting).

Sure, I’m around all next week if you’d like to meet up?

All fair points, but you can just regenerate a new seed phrase at account setup so there’s no “back door” unless I’m missing something...

Okay good point.  Post edited...

Ah would love to see an automatic movement with see-through caseback and some nice BTC symbol “signatures” on the movement.  Could even do something like imprinting a hash of something creative around the jewels.

I like the concept actually.  Could sweep funds for lost challenges into a vehicle that distributes each month to charity or top participants.  Or if you custody funds you can just earn interest off the btc that’s being held.

What subject is the paper for?  You could take different angles depending on computer science, macro/Austrian economics, history, consumer behavior, design, etc.

Some whiplash eh?  Hitting four month lows in an hour is pretty rough...first impression is that market absorbed a big sell order and now there is fallout...looking to stabilize around $8.2k - $8.5k.

Ah nice, like the Hublot model!?  If you ever want to collab on sourcing an automatic I have some good contacts in Asia that could get the price way down from there for a quality piece.

It’s not on-chain settlement, it’s settlement within the context of legacy financial systems.

Inflation is pretty complex but an oversimplification is that it happens in a few cases:
1.  When the money supply increases at a slower rate than the demand for goods and services using it, causing a rise in prices.  
2.  Conversely, an oversupply of USD (for example) in the economy lowers purchasing power of the dollar but raises it relative to other currencies, causing an increase in imports shifting demand curve outward and prices up.
3.  In general an expansionary fiscal policy from the govt (like infrastructure projects, military spending, etc) puts more money into pockets and drives demands for goods and services (which are limited) so prices will go up.
It’s also the difference between real and nominal interest rates - real rates include inflation while nominal is what you see on your savings account.  So at 3% inflation and 1% savings rate your real interest rate is -2%.
The structure is typically cited as being meant to encourage growth and consumption.
However with a deflationary currency like Bitcoin, most of this gets flipped around.  It’s all macro baby!
