I agree with all that.  Every asset attracts speculators, but when those assets have no to little intrinsic value and are just mainly being used as tools to speculate you get a bubble.  I guess my main argument is that bitcoin has yet to show any real world use (FEW companies accept bitcoin) and if a flood of money comes in BECAUSE of a stock crash I think it will then flood out when stocks show signs of recovery, and that will be very very bad for all of crypto.

It seems your saying is that people are interested in because of the speculative nature of cryptos.  If people come to crypto as a reaction to a stock market crash then they would have no qualms ditching crypto to go back into stocks which will become undervalued if there was a major crash prior.
I also disagree with the logic of "trading volumes indicate true value."  If people invest in something because they see lots of high trade volumes (the "everyone is doing it" mentality) instead of underlying value of the asset then that is a classic bubble attribute.

"Stock prices are at an ATH. Market is over bought and inflated. If the stock market crashes money surely will go in to crypto"
if your saying that "traditional" investors will flock to crypto because of a collapse in the stock market(which this little evidence that will happen) then that is bad for crypto.  In that situation hordes of money will flock to crypto, coin prices shoot.... but eventually the stock market will rebound and all those investors will take their crypto gains and go back to switch that money back into stocks, plummeting crypto.
