it's almost funny how sqig calls everyone who replies to him  a stalker and how he uses alt accounts to upvote himself and downvote others all the time to gain a little internet fame.
or maybe he gets paid for it :D

just like liquid ecstasy and liquid lsd, right?
not sure if trolling...
reminds me of the reason that prevented beer from becoming illegal (or other drugs from becoming legal) in germany:

if you look at the bitcointalk thread you'll see that nobody has confirmed this yet.
the OP just linked to a few blockchain.info addresses with statements like "i traced the coins to this address" and "do your own research", but apparently either nobody has tried that yet or nobody could be bothered to confirm that.
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:22:45
the thing is that nobody gives a fuck about the economic fundamentals of bitcoin.
hundreds of thousands of people are proving every day that bitcoin has value for them by using it for something they otherwise couldn't do.
be it avoiding high bank fees, playing poker from the US, donating to projects on the other side of the world, storing value in their brain, prevent banks and payment providers to sell their customer data,...
nobody cares whether bitcoin will ever be used as a currency. ofc we hope so but even if that fails bitcoin still has more than enough other uses.
sqig may be right or not, that's not the point here. the point is that he's a f\*cking d\*ck for trying to shove his opinion up our arses and thinking it somehow proves that bitcoin will fail.
false dilemma much?
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:16:19
i heard that this one is a bit more difficult because there's no clear solution how to split transaction fees or something, but I'm not sure.
maybe all problems are already solved and someone just has to implement the relevant BIP.
are there already pools and mining software making use of GBT?
sorry for the slow responses, got too much negative karma.
@_date: 2014-01-16 01:18:54
are you joking or trolling? you can't be serious.
sqig responds only to weak arguments and avoids the question or simply lies when answering strong ones.
then on the next day he'll be posting the same shit again.
and i do know that he is downvoting me because i ruled out historylessons and seeing how liberty also has some follower after telling sqid what an autistic fuck he is I'd say it is most likely him indeed.
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:07:51
you are beyond retarded.
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:27:58
aren't you one of the people working on the GetBlockTemplate BIP?
can you maybe shed some light on whether this can be used to solve these issues by giving power to the miners and how ready GBT is for real world usage?
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:52:21
lol you can shitpost all your want, it won't change anything :D
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:26:35
large sell-offs can only happen a set number of times so they can't be the absolute death of bitcoin.
if governments/banks keep pump and dumping for fun they will lose a lot of money in the process, giving an advantage to those countries that are embracing bitcoin.
I'd say in the worst case it won't be worse than it is now.
And bitcoin wasn't created to solve the world's financial problems but to give everyone the chance to use it without being discriminated.
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:44:15
he is a known troll. look through his history.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:54:08
why not? they're "infinitely" divisible, just like any other currency.
but obviously there's no known way to synchronize a blockchain faster than light. warp travel would be one, but we don't know if and how fast we could make things go at warp speed.

i agree and I also think miners should switch to other pools. did you remember to crosspost this in the mining subreddit and forum, where it most likely has a larger effect?
but it's important to remember that this is only a temporary solution,
that even p2pool nodes can abuse their power,
that pool operators most likely won't try anything illegal while the entire world is watching them,
and that there are technical solutions that could solve this issue once and for all.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:37:44

sounds like a coinion headline.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:35:22
i never said my solutions were the only ones, but you certainly don't *have* to switch to peercoin to be relatively safe from 51%.
also peercoin only works because it is under constant 100% attack from the authority server which is just ridiculous and exactly what we are trying to prevent here.
so you are wrong. wronger than wrong. [not even wrong]( stop downvoting me, fucking spammer asshole.
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:04:52
if you store something in the cloud, use proper end-to-end encryption, not dropbox or some shit from the USA.
or better, don't.
or send it to a multi-sig and store the backups in different places.
i agree with natanael though that electrum is probably the most convenient solution and seems to be quite secure too.
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:55:08
true that. but if we don't reply to them their fake upvotes make it look like they were raising legitimate points :/
also remember to use another account for posts not related to the trolls. your current account will keep accumulating downvotes forever.
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:02:36
great service, thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:01:38
the problem is that sqig, even though he is sometimes correct, often posts bullshit, either out of ignorance or because he's an asshole and he will ignore and downvote anyone correcting him and on the next day repost the same shit.
I'm not talking about economy or philosophy but technical details of the protocol that are not open for debate because computers always do the same.
and even if he might be correct about some economic points - then he could post them once, fuck off and find a new hobby elsewhere.
repeatedly posting the same shit over and over again is just pathetic.
and look at liberty8's post history, or mine. sqig follows us around and downvotes everything he sees.
edit: gave you all the upvotes i could, liberty. keep up the good work.
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:45:06
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:52:21
nobody wants to sue them for mining all the coins. people would sue them for double spending (aka theft/fraud).
that's why we need warning mechanisms in mining software that gives off alarms when too many double spends are mined, so even if the double spenders manage to stay anonymous, miners would force the pool operators to use standard software that rejects double spends from then on.
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:00:44
not sure if troll or just misinformed.
go read the fucking forum thread or any post on reddit that wasn't created by new accounts or known trolls.
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:42:00
lol, pay me then.
i sadly don't have enough bitcoins and not enough fear of ghash doing a 51% attack to cancel what I'm working on right now and write such a feature for free.
but i think people who are already familiar with the code will be able to code that much faster and cheaper anyway because they know where to implement it.
if you're a miner, maybe just ask the dev of your software, maybe he'll add it?
@_date: 2014-01-14 10:49:08
firstly, learn to understand variance - this may just be random chance.
secondly - didn't you get the memo? the FUD campaign is over.
people realized that ghash.io operators probably don't want to go to prison anytime soon.
if you really want to help, push for implementation of the various possible solutions.
like getblocktemplate, or warning mechanisms in mining software that go off if too many double spends are mined or if miners are forced to work on a secret fork.
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:52:49
zero-conf could be easily detectable if the appropriate code gets added to mining software.
it's easy to add a function that keeps track of how often a block includes a double spend that was received long after the original tx.
if mining software by default switched pools if it detects bad behaviour, I think many miners would use it and not bother downloading a forked version that allows double spends.

can the technology also be added on top of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:32:53
uhm thanks for the info i guess but what is your problem, man?
unless 82 is your actual age, you are acting really weird.
you do realize that a) this post references internet culture and b) this scenario is entirely theoretical, right? no, you don't.
so there is literally no frequency in the entire spectrum that can be used to provide payment services in emergency situations without strong backlash from the community?
please remind me to stay away from these guys.
so what if the military does it?
obviously AMPRNet technology can be used on other frequencies aswell...
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:20:21
are you fucking trolling? do you even know what double spend means?
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:42:22
read further, troll.
you said there are no solutions, i posted some solutions.
and i think people do care about ghash and enough miners will switch once they figure out how to set up their software and which pool to use.
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:55:11
thanks for explaining the meme.
but in this case it's actually somewhat true as it speaks for the power and existing adoption for bitcoin.
"kill off" is obviously a sensationalist exaggeration, but china will probably provide an interesting environment to see how bitcoin survives in a not-so-friendly environment and to improve the protocol and services accordingly.

@_date: 2014-01-14 00:09:25
it's just another layer of security. 
just like not uploading it to cloud providers that can't be trusted adds another layer.
i think though that bip38 might be more secure than truecrypt. you could also combine both steps in case one kind of encryption has a weakness.
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:14:29
oh sorry then. it just seemed weird.
guess there are just too many trolls on this forum downvoting everyone they can find.
