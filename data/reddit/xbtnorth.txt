Yes, as well as changing other properties and perhaps probability to succeed.
But we're all in favour of using less energy if it works, and different things might work at later stage than what works in the beginning.
I think btemtd more questioned why you found bitcoin's energy consumption "almost scary" and not the currently used system.

Yes, but you need to suggest something that solves the problem using less energy. Traditional currencies seem to use vastly more energy than bitcoin, it's just more obvious in Bitcoin's case.

But why should bittorrent p2p be faster than bitcoin p2p? I know it is, but I feel like that is something that should be fixed. Bitcoin is p2p, why involve other p2p software?
Btw how long time does the torrent take to download+check? I went from 15% to 100% of the blockchain in 6h, but the CPU (dual core haswell) was maxed the whole time, not the network (100 mbit).
And bittorrent is a pretty bad protocol for this because a torrent can't be updated after it is published, you have to publish a completely new one. Then you have to get all peers to update to the new version somehow. Much better if everyone was just running bitcoin then everything happens automatically.

He oversimplifies the fractional reserve discussion far too much. Professor Fekete (of gold price backwardation-fame) has written a good piece about it in case anyone is interested:
