This isn't strictly a bitcoin problem, and could easily be a LifeProTip on another sub.  Never tell people what you have unless you trust them implicitly.  
These people are no different than the leeches that come after you when you win the lottery.  Always about them and whatever problem-du-jour is that requires your money in their pocket.  Always say no.

This is correct.  The gears for the collapse were in motion, and many of us (well, I know I did) got into the housing market as the shit was hitting the fan, because we saw this on the mid-term outlook.
Satoshi, may have seen it coming as I did, but considering his paper was in November 2008, almost into 2009, the timing indicates that this was likely more reactive rather than proactive.

The more you put in, the less the %ge is.  100 and under, it's high, 101 and over it's a bit lower (worked out to about 10% if I recall, not taking into account mining fees).  1000 bucks you get the "privilege" of only 5% or something like that.
Still, cheaper to use an exchange and wire/EFT money.

All the ATMs in Toronto are high.  Bitcoin Kings also has a few machines around, and they are about the same.  They do give a discount over 100$ though.

I have no horse in the race, but as an IT professional and having coded for many years, this pretty much sums up my thoughts.  The fact it is still in "release candidate" is concerning.

This is indeed what I read (I can't recall the site) and understand the situation to be.
