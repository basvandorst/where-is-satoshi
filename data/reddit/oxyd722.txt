Polite question: were you referring to Brexit?

Nice to see there are other honest riders on this sub ��

And I hope you recover your losses sooner than later, friend.
Word of advice, next time you feel the urge to do something like that, just get off the computer, leave the boat and go do a 7-minute workout or three. Hopefully it will provide enough “high” to your brain so things come back to normal and you can HODL again like a champ!

Was thinking about the $8000 barrier while on a nice ride today.
Lambos and Teslas are surely great status symbols, but not everyone will get that filthy rich...
Most of us are in it for the freedom, so I wanted to share a gentle reminder that there will be other ways to experience freedom if everything goes as per plan!
Just my Sunday evening shitpost, for the love of this community and their crazy funny memes ��

Yes. Log in on Coinbase and then browse to GDAX.com, you’ll see.
I invite you to search on the topic in this sub as the differences have been well covered before :)

No hard feelings

Thanks for sharing this “educational video”.
I’m sending to a friend who wants to get on the Bitcoin train with his partner, but has a track record of gambling addiction...
Is it not the untold story of most so-called day traders though? Video could be useful to anyone you we’ve been saying HODL to... ��

I suggest you get yourself acquainted with GDAX.com
It will use your Coinbase credentials, you pay less fees, and conserve some of the convenience of Coinbase, like for money transfers in and easy transfers between both services. It is not a web wallet though... do you have a wallet strategy?

Oh no! Hate speech ��
Did you get lost on your way to r/btc ?

This pretty much summarizes all the info I’ve been researching, reading and collating today, but in a much more concise form.
Thanks for sharing, I’ve already sent to friends for them to understand the current landscape.

Oh, I’m the same here. The day there is an electric motorcycle that can run for 300 miles at least and recharge in 30 minutes, I probably will get it!
No noise, no emissions, the ideal 2-wheel to explore national parks...

But this would result in legit users being hidden too. Some may have important things to ask or share...
Also some people, like me, have time-limited accounts that we throw away. Means you’d hide the comments from long-time users.
And it would also create a new layer of censorship.
Are you in favor of more censorship?

I'm looking forward to this type of battery innovation, along with BTC @ $100K !

I remember seeing that back there and I’m suddenly feeling a little older ��
