Alright, cool. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:58:35
I'll take some.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:32:51
I'm here just to see how this goes. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 21:25:10
So, how do I confirm this? 
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:36:43
I feel like you tipping totally goes against your title.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:48:33
Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:05:00
Long time coming. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:05:32
Why can't you care about both?
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:18:33
It's not that weird, you just haven't got the timing down yet. 
You may have a few haters that get to you early, but you also fall victim to posting when the community is at its lowest. 
Learn the times of the day when traffic is at its highest in and you should get more visibility.

This is by far the best way to get the message out there. Appreciate it.

1. I have not heard of you until now
2. I like the willingness to reach out to and offer a pretty good incentive to learn more. I'm also pretty excited about a new marketplace.
3. Nothing so far.
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:18:03
I'll take one. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:51:36
Hey, thanks for the information. Definitely a good way to reach people.
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:55:07
Pretty big fan of ninja tipping.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:15:32
Glad to see big risks getting paid off. Unfortunately I wasn't as daring and got in too small. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:18:24
Yea I told my buddy who actually knows how to do stuff like this.
