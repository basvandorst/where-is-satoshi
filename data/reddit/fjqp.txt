Anyone know an alternative to buy legitimate Amazon gift cards using Bitcoin? Bitpay is the only authorized distributor I know of but their fees are insane, they literally force you to use a "normal priority fee" when you make the order, and then they charge you a "network fee" which I don't fully understand (I'm still kinda new to all of this), so you end up paying the miner fee and also that network fee I mentioned.

Well yeah I don't know where that number comes from but the market is growing certainly.

Sorry to bother you but do you have by any chance a link to that talk you mention?

It is very real. Right now minimum wage is ~450000 Bs, which is around 5-5.50USD at the current rate (~80000 Bs/USD) and every day keeps going up. 1 Kg  of chicken costs around 40000 Bs, and 1 Kg of beef goes for ~90000 Bs, rice is around 30000 Bs I think, so you can imagine bitcoin/altcoin mining is very profitable since electricity is dirt cheap, and if you live in the capital there are no power outages.

Well it is heavily subsidised so it is really cheap, but in many cities/small towns there are power outages which is detrimental for electronics and such, unlike Caracas (the capital) where it almost never happens.

This was published by the local body that regulates crypto, recognizing that miners are being extortionated by local "autorithies", and you should call them if that happened to you. You'll probably won't find any help by emailing them anyways.
