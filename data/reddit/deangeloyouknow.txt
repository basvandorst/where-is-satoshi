Who ever satoshi was it's highly unlikely their computer was infected. But to try every combination. Idk if there is enough time in the universe for that to happen.

 Are you a millionaire yet?
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:16:10
Yes, but you would have to guess the keys of their wallet address. And depend on how many words are his private keys would take you alot time. I don't even know if it would be able to guess in polynomial time. 
I honestly think you got better odds playing the powerball.
