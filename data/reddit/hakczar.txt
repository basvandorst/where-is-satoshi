Shouldn't we be relying on market forces to drive down fee rates?  If one brokerage can profitably undercut another brokerage, they will.  I imagine the brokerages have to jump through a lot of hoops to integrate the bitcoin system to the existing financial system, and thus the fees.

A bunch of bitcoin miners got left behind in the transition from GPU to ASIC mining, and had a bunch of super high end GPU's lying around.  Rather than let the GPU's go to waste, they started mining scrypt currencies like Litecoin.

I had no idea there was so much potential in extending the base protocol...the assurance contracts idea is a game changer.

what happens though if an attacker just constantly generates 0.00000001 btc spam transactions at a rate high enough that it causes a progressively larger queue of deferred transactions to build? I suppose the miners can choose to ignore those transactions, opting to process only those that have associated tx fees, but then does this just increase the cost of using bitcoin for all the honest users?  I suppose then though the surge in tx fees will incentivize more miners to come online which will increase the scalability of the network and reduce the negative impact of the spam transactions.

Shut down trading? As a business, since they get transaction commissions, they stand to completely rake it all in during huge volume spikes like this.

I wish bitcoin went down to 9 decimal places instead of just 8.  then we could have nano-btc :/

Good point.  During the mtgox DDos a couple days ago, bitcoinity showed a flat line for bitcoin trading activity during that time.  thus mtgox is responsible currently for the vast majority of bitcoin transactions.  though it'd be interesting to see the ratio of traffic from mtgox to satoshi dice
