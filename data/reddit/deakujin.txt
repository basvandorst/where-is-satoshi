Cyprus depositors' arent safe. I cant even offer them a space to use bitcoins locally 
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:57:02
How many coins for a days worth of browsing, on average???
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:30:09
looks like its BS people
@_date: 2013-05-18 17:55:52
Where did you find that? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:29:52
Thanks. Any idea how to cancel orders? There's a glitch. Nothing seems to work for me
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:00:09
Could you provide more info? I cant find OP's posts.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:26:13
It wont even cancel. How can you see the queue?
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:54:19
One reason could be for protection purposes just in case someone steals your stuff. Don't credit cards have daily withdrawal limits for the same reason?
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:02:17
@_date: 2013-05-17 14:28:41
Is bitcoin owned/registered by anyone?? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:01:37
Saved! 
So awesome. I especially like the 'cash is king' 
Would love to use the .ai to laser-cut on perspex.. I'll talk to my laser guy tomorrow morning about it
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:03:30
How's about 
giggity giggity gox ? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:24:33
Can someone try sending me?
I don't know if my address is valid
Thanks so much guys

newb here: When you say you have the Pass Through - do you mean you have 1 PT share?
@_date: 2013-05-31 01:29:30
We're gonna be alright
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:02:25
How did you make it?
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:25:18
 it could. But it doesn't feel like it will if you know what I mean.
 i think bitcoin has some elements of fandom in it. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 14:43:34
Wow thanks - like someone else mentioned, if I get their 'permission' I can register it. It still smells a bit dodgy though
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:25:21
Did anyone get any?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:00:01
Central Bank much?
@_date: 2013-05-17 14:35:28
I've contacted Mt.Gox. I just hate their customer service though
@_date: 2013-05-25 22:09:50
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:55:12
Seriously why is that?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:48:25
@ what price ? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:14:35
Depends on what you want it for: profit, usage, collectors item..
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:58:58
here 
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:43:10
bitcoin.com is registered under 
which is the Bitcoin Foundation
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:36:25
Now THATS what I call adoption!
This is amazing. 
CryptoCyprus congrats. We should meet up and discuss! 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:41:40
It's 
Can someone in here please verify/give karma? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:46:42
You can still transfer some as far as I know
@_date: 2013-06-26 14:48:42
Thanks - but that's not for the dividends. That's only for the total BTCs. Maybe it needs to come up to 0.1BTC in order to withdraw? 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:11:30
Thanks for that
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:51:26
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:55:07
You can add funds to your Mt.Gox in 5 minutes. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:48:26
@_date: 2013-05-17 15:27:02
Yes up to that amount. Over that we will have a huge stealing of our deposits... 
@_date: 2013-05-17 15:42:58
bitcoin.cy must be the only one which isn't
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:28:06
God bless your soul ! 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:30:30
Good question - do you mean per exchange site or per person?
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:34:10
shit why did i leave them in?
@_date: 2013-05-20 10:45:35
Update: 
Mt.Gox was actually very prompt and seems to be helping out with the domain registration office in providing authorisation for the trademark. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:54:23
on Mt.Gox - you can transfer funds to your wallet in approximately 6 minutes!
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:03:51
amazing work buddy
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:16:50
Be a man. Buy more Bitcoin. It's not a bubble, it's the future you guys
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:10:50
It was. Very nicely put
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:38:09
I wonder what will happen once all the speculators and sharks leave it alone
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:10:48
1) A QR code wouldn't work.
2) I don't want to use stickers as this could be illegal - I want to be as legal and as green as possible. I am simply 'cleaning' a part of the road in front of shops.
3) I would like to attract the attention of the shop owners/manager and not just a specific age group.
4) I would like to create something beautiful in order for someone to take a photo and share (passers by)
5) I don't want to promote bitcoin only, but the ability for a merchant to use it, so not too generic if you know what i mean.
@_date: 2013-05-31 01:30:27
LAME - They won't let me use it. Bitcoin 'belongs' to Mt.Gox. It's over gang... 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:02:15
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:20:29
I have the same issue when trying to buy
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:57:04
Final close of the day will be at 300 :) lots of buys
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:32:36
well, if a war starts between N.Korea and allies, the price will explode. So will other commodities
