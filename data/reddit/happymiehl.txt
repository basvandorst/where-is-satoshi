Bunch of the ones who didn't deserve to be here in the first place backed out from fear. 
This is where you capitalize.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:21:50
Why is that
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:17:59
I'm on mobile, I can't see any sidebars.
 I'll take a look in the morning, thanks

Yeah I just figured their trading day is pretty well over. Though with bitcoin this is like a 24 hour market
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:56:34
I should actually give you the hardest right hook I've ever thrown

Trust me man I am on the bitcoin boat and a HODLer
I want to see the price hit 20k by 2018.
I'm just saying that this could very well be a possibility, were all small fish when it comes to the grand scheme of this.  
Why would any massive corporation with direct influence on the profits or losses want this guy who nobody who knows or where his location is to reap all of this gain. 
It's a cut throat world and who knows man.  Bitcoin is strong to say the least but it will become outdated with time in my opinion.  
It is great for people who have a million dollars to store and move it, but it extremely inconvenient for something as simple as buying a coffee.  
Do we as a community want this to be an asset, or a decentralized currency?
With having big fish like Winklevoss twins with as much as 120 000 BTC, they almost act the same as a reserve.  I understand they can't print FIAT coins but they and any others with a significant amount of BTC rule the price, and that's just fact.

Yeah looking to start buying around 6600-6000
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:02:07
I'll buy them off ya ;)

Hey man, thanks for your reply!
Currently working but if you could shoot me a pm I'm willing to send you a bit of cash if you could help me do this successfully.  I am worried about messing up and losing what I have
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:55:23
Send them my way
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:56:49
I tried to submit a picture of my id and I tried maybe 20 times.  The site and app is broken.  I try to talk to support but they are just bots
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:30:34
I agree. Any of the big players could one day decide that they don't value bitcoin, switch to the next crypto that is better, faster, and more compatible. 
Possibly make it easier for newer users to understand.  I also lost over a thousand dollars when I first got into this when trying to transfer ETH to BTC because I got the wallets mixed up.
Things like this are an issue and will be solved in future to come, but these are real issues that should concern us.
The big companies could pull out and render this bitcoin useless and put it into their own crypto or whichever one they choose to adopt.
Maybe bitcoin is the Tesla and we're waiting for the bigger picture to form itself
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:23:21
Feel this way exactly
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:55:32
I expect to end at around 7k today.
If it dips below that I'm buying meni more...
Let's be glad for this price drop and capitalize on it.  Don't play into the Wall Street game.  They are trying to scare you out of the profits 
1 cig down, 4 to go.  Calming down a bit
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:21:29
Give it at least 12 hours man, Asia needs to wake up .  
agree with the other guy this could go waaay lower than 6k...
big downtrend.  Good opportunity for profit, keep an eye on Asia.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:09
Dude you're actually an idiot.
For your own safety take this down man... you can't trust anybody
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:01:32
Please stop shit talking HODL'rs as I am one of them
I bought 3 back in 2015 when they were trading for ~340 each
Holding them until they can buy my Porsche 911 turbo or until they take the carpet from under my feet.
Either way I stress way more than I should over these God damn things.
Can we all just adopt this into our everyday lives so I can have a million dollars ?  Is that too much to ask?  Fuck sakes 
3 cigs down, 2 to go.  God I'm a degenerate
