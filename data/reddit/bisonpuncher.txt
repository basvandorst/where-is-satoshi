Or it could be that their opinion is that the crash is a sign of things to come and the value will only go down.
Clearly your opinion is the opposite and is no more or less valid. Allergic to making money though amirite

I never understood donating to charity unless you're extremely wealthy. $50,000 is a lot to me, but to a gigantic charity it's hardly a drop in the bucket. I figure it hurts me more than it helps them

I dont need a youtube video to understand the speed of electric cars. I've driven a tesla among a ton of other high performing vehicles. I just dont like electric cars because I want an engine. I like to build cars, work on them, and I enjoy the entire experience of a GASOLINE powered car.
Another issue I have with electric cars is how its possible to limit them. The factory can downgrade or upgrade your car without your consent, they're loaded with microphones and other things that probably collect "marketing data". I just dont like it one bit. I dont like a car that thinks for me. My old Mercedes would vibrate the steering wheel if I crossed over lanes, even if it was a purposeful lane change. I'd prefer a car just do what I tell it to and not the other way around. A tesla beats some high performance cars in a race, and a bunch of other high performance cars will beat a tesla in a race. A TON of modified gas powered cars will beat a tesla in a race. There's just a lot more to a car than its speed. The car I'm currently in will outrun a P100D, but thats not why I have it. Theres MUCH more to a car than how fast it will run a 1/4 or how fast it can complete a circuit. There isnt a right or wrong, though. Driving is a very personal thing and this is just how I see it.

an aventador SV is about $500 - $580k. In most areas its a pretty nice house.

A lot of people see cars as something more than just an appliance for moving around town. I'll always prefer cars that run on real fuel.

I'm always genuinely surprised when I find people like you out in the wild. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:29:47
You know, I always see this sort of thing and I'm always interested, but everyone says the same thing. "You have to know what you're doing". I never see anyone talk about how/where they learned. I imagine learning about every potential pump is exceedingly difficult.

I've only ever purchased BTC on Coinbase until very recently switching to Gemini, so I guess I'm not too experienced with BTC exchanges.
I figured it would go something like:    
1. Register for Bitstamp, register for Bitfinex.     
2. Deposit $1000 into each.     
3. Buy 1 BTC for $766 on Bitstamp     
4. Withdraw 1 BTC to Electrum from Bitstamp  
5. Deposit 1 BTC from Electrum into Bitfinex  
6. Sell 1 BTC on Bitfinex for $771    
7. $4 or something profit after fees    
I bought 2 BTC today on Gemini and it cleared almost immediately, and then I withdrew the BTC to Electrum. I dont see why I couldnt deposit it into another exchange and sell it for more. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 08:49:42
No, I accounted for the fees (withdrawal, deposit, and exchange). It would be $4 profit after fees for every bitcoin bought and sold. I think Im going to give it a try with 1 BTC just to see how it actually goes.

You sound so childish right now.

What? Cant most altcoins be compared to penny stocks? its just gambling and they probably wont go anywhere
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:02:55
No. It's because it's fucking absurd. No one is targeted and kidnapped because they advertise they own bitcoin on their car. This isn't Mexico or Africa.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:14:41
And here I am, sitting on the sidelines because fucking coinbase and glidera are nonfunctional piles of shit.

You cant just upload a picture. You need to use their interactive web app to take the photo. The web app requests access to the webcam, snaps a photo live, and then uploads it. It doesnt work on a phone

I had an issue with Coinbase during the shoot up to $1100. They told me to reverify my ID and I absolutely could not - they just wouldnt accept it. I was so pissed that I was missing out. I made a Gemini account and here I am, able to buy and sell all I want. 
Thank you Coinbase for being a piece of shit and forcing me away from your platform. I was unable to buy at the top, and now I'm able to buy the dip.

TIL people with nice cars are regularly kidnapped and murdered. This is Australia not mexico

Gotta make sure those internet strangers think highly of you!
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:44:26
No. Coinbase stopped using that mobile camera verification method and now they REQUIRE webcam photos. Absolute bullshit, too. I'll be trying Kraken and Gemini... and whatever else people post.

Where on earth do you live where people are being beaten with pipes because they own bitcoin

Are you just generally paranoid? I drove a Maserati for a year and this wasn't even a concern. No one just gets kidnapped for driving a nice car

They dont allow that. Its webcam only.

Yes, I've done that. It says "Please log in at coinbase.com to continue with ID verification" I'm on Android

Like I replied to someone else...
Doesnt have to be all. $100 in btc when it was $0.38 would be $710,526. Not bad
I was merely providing an example

I worked at a place that did auto repair and bodywork. A lot of those places dont care so much about under the table work. While I was doing this I also got pretty deep into PPD marketing on youtube. Not a very good way to make money, but for a 14 year old it was alright. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:36:12
Have you not taken your meds today?
You stated because he was 14 it was impossible he bought bitcoin early and sold it at a large profit. That is not impossible.  No, he didnt know. No, he didnt buy at the absolute lowest or sell at the highest.
Buying early and selling high happens to tons of people. Saying it didnt happen to him because he was apparently 14 is ridiculous. There is not a single reason that it would be impossible for that to happen. You'll find a ton of people on this sub who basically won the bitcoin lottery.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:07:58
I had $100 in eth when it was $8 and sold at $200
Its like winning the powerball but being 1 number off. Sort of pissed. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:14:37


This is such a technicality. The guy admits he got lucky and essentially won the lottery. Come on now.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:45:00
I dont know. Maybe they spend half their savings and still have a few million today. Or 1/3, or 1/4. Either way you'd be doing very well today.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:13:06
When I was 14 I probably had about $1500. If I invested all that in BTC when it was $0.38 it would now be worth $10,263,157.9
Nothing about the above is untrue and nothing about the above is even unbelievable. It is a thing which could have happened, and likely has happened to many different people.
