Every time is the time to pick up some cheap coins, it seems.

Because going short, in finance, means borrowing a stock with a speculation that the stock will go down in value. You sell the stock and, when that stock's price plummets as you've speculated, then you buy it back. You cannot go short on something that you own. It HAS to be borrowed.

It's not a good idea to buy bitcoins @ mtgox at all. Mtgox is a scam. They're going down hill and they're STILL cashing in on people's hopes that mtgox will allow withdrawals again. I suggest you avoid Mtgox like a plague.

This is why I don't think that the option to go short on bitcoin is a good idea at all.

That market cap is too damn high! 
Seriously, the time bitcoin reaches 100 TRILLION market cap is the time the world ends.

I'm sorry but when money is involved, then honesty CANNOT be the norm.

That system is flawed then. You will either extremely undervalue a house or no one can afford one. You can't just tell people that they have to buy houses cash. No one will buy it unless it's EXTREMELY cheap. Either way, the real estate industry is going to crash all the way down to Niflheim if loans cannot exist.

Thank you very much. That's all I needed to know =)

This is what I want to know. I believe bitcoin's value will sky rocket. It's too expensive right now which is why I'll have to settle for satoshis. I would like some input from the cognoscenti regarding this matter.

1. Go short on bitcoins
2. Halt all the bitcoin trades which will cause bitcoin prices to go down.
3. Buy as much bitcoins as possible while prices are low.
4. Resume Trading.
5. Prices of bitcoins go up.
6. ???
7. Profit
Win-win for everybody!

If the this so called "credible" exchange like Gox can go run away with people's bitcoins just like that, then what can keep other exchanges from doing the same? I saw someone sate on this site that whoever can establish an exchange firm can make a TON of money. At first I hoped it was because of the fees. But now, I definitely can say that he is right. An exchange can just run away with your money =(
