Doesn’t the 2fa change each time? That’s the whole point. It even does that for gmail.

He’s not the first or last guy to lose half his investment. What makes bitcoin/crypto unique is all the new investors who think for sure they’re gonna be billionaires on an investment that’s already gone up 100,000%.

1)  Maybe he's not an asshole
2)  Maybe he enjoys the aura surrounding the mystery and doesn't want it solved, even if it is solved incorrectly

You'd have to be a special kind of stupid to put money in a Chinese bitcoin company.

Yes but the verified account hacks is new — I’ve just seen obvious fake accounts try it.

I don't understand how people want this to be a legitimate money source who at the same time, are cheering these wild jumps.  Those two things cannot co-exist.  And it cannot go up forever.  It will crash or stabilize out.  Right now this is simply a huge bubble -- maybe the bubble will last much longer, maybe not.  But it can't go up forever.  And no legitimate source of money will be popular if it is subject to wild price swings.  Right now this is just a bubble brought on by perceived scarcity.

Does anyone really believe Bitcoin is operating as a *currency* at this point?  It seems to me that is simply a very speculative "investment" similar to a penny stock.  Lots of hype and completely uninformed investors running the price up.  The whole scenario is a bit weird.  Who is really benefiting (in a way bad for public policy) from all this?  Maybe nobody.  But people still might get burned.

As soon as you can trade in fractional Bitcoins, there is zero scarcity.  There is no scarcity.  It doesn't matter if there is 20 million or 20 trillion.  It's just a number.  What is significant is the permanent lock on the total float.  But it is not scarce, not at all.

This is literally the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Gold is an actual item, it has weight, it has mass, it has utility.  Yes it can be infinitely divided but every piece is smaller and less useful and less valuable than the piece it broke off from.  
Bitcoins, on the other hand have no mass and no use other than being sold to people who value them.  It doesn't matter if you are buying .1 BTC, 1.0 BTC, or 100 BTC.  You are concerned about price, value, stability, safety, etc.  Nothing changes between those amounts.

What a shock that this little super-bubble is being traded in the Middle East, lol.  Arabs are even dumber than Asians.

I just realized that this poster is a long time redditor posting lots of links, etc.  Has he been verified as actually Senator Moran?

IMO it's a bubble because it could burst in a second.  It could be 50 tomorrow.  Or 200.  Or 0.  If you don't believe that, you're very, very naive.

I am fairly shocked at the level of stupidity here, but maybe I shouldn't be.  Good luck geniuses, I'm sure Bitcoin will go to 100,000 and you'll all be millionaires.
