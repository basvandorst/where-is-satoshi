Got something bad to say about Titcoin?

Are you saying that the Lightning network needs more lightning? /s

Everything you said is very true. But hey, I don't have to worry about the last part at all (selling services), which as you'd expect, means that PayPal is really good for me.
My point I guess is that I think it is a lot more fair, and a better choice than some individuals in the crypto world make it out to be.

First off all, if they hit your card for a transaction you didn't approve of, you call your bank or credit card and just say that. You won't be in good standing with PayPal, but they can't force a payment out of you and hold onto it. Just doesn't work that way.  
The transactions aren't "reversable" like people are saying here. If a case opens, you have your say and if you are legitimately in the right, PayPal will side with you. I have been through it. If they don't side with you, they make the buyer send the item back as long as you request it and state you have a return policy.

that is within .2% of credit card fees. 
If you think both of those (PayPal and Credit Cards) are unreasonable and crypto is the way to go  with receiving payment, it is very clear you don't actually run a business that sells a product. Tell people to use bitcoin, and you won't sell jack shit 99% of the time.

I use it every day for my business. The "insane fees" are about .2% away from what I would pay if I used a bank account directly and paid the credit card fee myself. 
700-800 sales, 3 total cases ever opened against me. Average transaction is $150-$200.  Won 2, and lost 1. PayPal made the customer return the item before I refunded him on the one I lost. You guys act like PayPal is the wild west and it is rampant with scammers. It's not. 
Just saying PayPal will side with a buyer without reason is anecdotal bullshit. Saying that PayPal will take your money and leave the buyer with the item is again, bullshit. That only happens if you ignore the case the buyer opens. If you do that, you deserve whatever judgement PayPal gives.
