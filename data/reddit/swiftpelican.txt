This is exactly what happened... I know two people, not personally but heard from friends, that bought at ~17,000 for the first time and were super excited when the price went to 19000! They were advised that it’s long term and not to be afraid if the price dips because that’s just how bitcoin seems to act. Then the past two days, my phone was blowing up because people were asking me if they should sell because the price went to 15000 and they don’t want to lose more money. I calmly said “do. Not. Sell.” 
Few hours later drops to ~13000.. and yes. 
they sold.... ����‍♂️  I didn’t even respond to the texts after that.
Best part of the story. I probably bought the same coins they sold cause I bought when the price went below 14000.

Where do I get one?

I would like to know the answer for this too! Good question!

You’re getting the price 2-4 days later when your money reaches the account.. 
I know I know. Annoying

I bought some at 4600.. I knew it was a odd decision but I wanted to get back into it before it gets to be too expensive. It went up to 4930 and I was happy as hell....... 2 days later I wasn't too happy.
Needless to say from recent events, I'm still not happy, but like drake once said... you only live once. 
Im in it for the long haul.

I must be doing it all wrong then. 
Where do you keep your coin if you don't mind me asking? Because coinbase has a wallet of its own, I thought.
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:56:01
correct me if I am wrong, but you're saying keeping the coin within the coin base wallet is not as safe as keeping it in your own wallet?

I haven't ever had a problem with them. No issues yet. 
I purchased the bitcoin about 5 days ago, and it usually takes a week for the transaction to complete for me. So I haven't received my coin yet, but I am worried that these problems I see people talking about are going to affect me and potentially lose me money.  
What do you use for what you said is your own wallet?

I would like this question answered too! Most people around here love to be sarcastic and never fully answer anyone’s questions..
Thanks for asking OP!
