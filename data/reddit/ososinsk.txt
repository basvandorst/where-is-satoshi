Yeah, this post was the straw that broke the camels back. The top 3 posts in are the same thing. Unsubscribed.

Doesn't the mere existence of this wallet destabilize the currency? This is more than 10% of the final total number of bitcoin, which could stay out of circulation forever, or could go on the market all at once. Imagine if the owner lost the key, or died, and that amount stayed in limbo forever, but for all we know could go into circulation at any time.

I was part of that class action suit, your right that they lost. I received my settlement check last year for it actually. I got back $2.15 out of the however many hundreds they took.

Ohhh. I thought it was about making millions of dollars. He was just trying to highlight totalitarian laws.

Well, you quit school before they got to the part about 'risk'.

Because it gives them real world value. If no one uses bitcoin for goods and services, then they are nothing more than a speculative bubble. Spending them helps show businesses that they can be worth something.

I think that's the best in-person bitcoin implementation I've seen yet. Nice.

I didn't mean to make it sound like I was agreeing with the interviewee when he lumped Snowden and Manning in with Ulbricht. I think Snowden, and to a lesser extent Manning, were indeed acting as whistle-blowers to uncover wrongdoing by the government.
I don't think Ulbricht was about that at all. He was running a business, pure and simple, which is fine. However, I see no reason to believe he was doing it as a favour to humanity, rather than just to make money.
Along with his libertarian ideals, he says that ["Just as slavery has been abolished most everywhere, I believe violence, coercion and all forms of force by one person over another can come to an end."]( If the charges against him are to be believed, then we all know what bullshit that is.
