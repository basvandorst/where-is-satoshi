Yes, i tried that too, leaving way enough for the fee, still failing

Yeah but 500 BTC is 500K mBTC or half a million dollars, far from a trillion but it's amazing since BTC was just an obscure geeky thing a year ago and to some extent still is.

Thanks man, that would make sense, just another 4 days of waiting hopefully.

People keep saying that ghash.io is free but there's a 0.001 commission on BTC withdrawal. I am used to getting automated payment 0.01 at a time on btcguild and slush, that means 10% fee for ghash.io.
The alternative is to wait to get at least 0.1 or better before withdrawing which is equivalent to a 1% fee.

yeah, this was my first thought, damn, OP is in trouble now

Funny enough, buy a gift card with bitcoins and coinbase can't trace you anymore

Happy Friday everyone!

Well, the BTC I went to withdraw are in my account but the website gives me a not enough funds error.... Another exchange with a drained hot wallet??
Anybody else has the same issue?
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:15:39
But for some people it may be too early to joke about it :)

I can't really understand the downvoting, this sub is amazing!
@_date: 2014-07-28 21:09:35
The fact that she poses and look like a top model prevents me from taken this seriously.
Scratch that, it's just the post and beauty type shot.

How can one register on that class action lawsuit?
@_date: 2014-06-24 22:03:42
Why Arbitrage?
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:00:42
I got the BTC back in my account... 
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:22:56
This beats my previous experience with clippy for sure!

Just got an answer from Mtgox, similar to what other have posted:
Thank you for contacting MtGox Support. We are sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
We can see that your withdrawal is yet to be processed. The transactions are being re-issued automatically, all BTC are safe, the transaction will be processed and they are not lost or stolen. We are working to resolve the issue, but at this point we are unable to give a definite date of resolution. However we will also escalate this to our developers and update you once the withdrawal is processed.
We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused and Thank you for 
your patience.
Best regards,

Lawl! Thanks, pure comedy!

same here, those jerks and their nosey attitude

Why does being open source has anything to do with changing the name?
Apache is apache, firefox is firefox, ...
Damn, devs really don't get the importance of good communication and even a tiny little bit of marketing.

Man you must be stressed, look at your nervous spelling!

Well, I was trying to get out!
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:54:29
To the moon!!!
@_date: 2014-03-08 10:54:59
I am not asking for support just alerting, I for one have moved my miners elsewhere for the time being.
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:43:59
Thanks for the On Topic comment, I am still convinced that the BTC will get back in but the big question mark is when....
Good luck with yours as well.

^Damn, affiliate link on first page of r/bitcoin, this guy is gonna get rich quick.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:10:14
Why don't you limit the number of transaction per account per unit of time?
Also I would ban all transaction below 0.01 BTC, that's way too small.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:23:52
They should put something on their website, at least to say that we should expect a lag between sending coins and having them available!
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:33:49
Are you blocking new bitcoin deposits?
I have 100 BTC sent to you, confirmed 26 times and still not showing up in my account!
That's unacceptable, I could have used another exchange, now I either panic or wait and see the price crumble.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:12:03
Thanks for confirming I am not alone, I am still wondering why I sent coin there with all the issues lately.
DAMN IMPULSES!
