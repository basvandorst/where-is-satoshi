Very few drive a Tesla because they're green, it's an $80,000 spend. Same for petrol savings, unless you were intending on spending that much on a car anyway but I doubt you're bothered about petrol costs when you're spending that much on a car.
They drive them because they're incredibly nice cars and use some of the latest tech on the market.

It was 50p when I heard about it and I dismissed it...
If I had spent £5 on BTC, I'd have a good £24k right now. Except probably not because I would have cashed out years ago at £500 knowing my luck.

Bukkit Plugin dev here, this is _very_ easily possible without a client mod, you can just tell people to sign up on the pool, then have a system that tells people when a Bitcoin has spawned (maybe a quick mobile app too?). Each player has a pool account with a Minecraft name registered to it, then they have to login and somewhere on the map (we'll make it a big map...) would be a Bitcoin (well, sponge maybe seeing as it's noticeable and not in vanilla Minecraft without spawning it). They have to pick it up, then take it all the way back to their store at the spawn city type place. Enable PVP and such so they can fight over it, etc.
It's _very_ doable, you can hook into the pool so that when a player gets a 'Bitcoin' back they get a payout to their wallet.
You would of course also have it as a normal Minecraft server too. And if you took something like a 1% fee from each coin, it would pay for itself as it grew more popular.

It could be made a thing c:

That's what I was thinking.

Is there already a cross-platform Bitcoin wallet app that lets you send/receive BTC? A nice, intuitive one with QR reading capability and the same sort of PIN requirement you see from the Paypal app and Authy would actually be really good.
Of course, you'd never keep more than maybe $100 tops on it, but that's really the same as when you're carrying cash around.

Surely if you're mining on your CPU you're probably not going to get anything out of mining anyways?
