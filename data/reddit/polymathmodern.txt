This depends on your definition of long. unless you're long only means the start of December, you're likely still winning. It's the hope of the future that drives the  mentality, not the quick buck.

still dipping. Hold on and try at the "bottom"

They're implementing a fix, but they've allowed trading (if it goes through) since 9:28pst.

Definitely. It's the same company, uses the same login, and you can have instant transfers from coinbase. The best part is very small fees by comparison.

OH NOOOOO /s

You can wire money, or set yourself up on other exchanges (gemini/bitstamp) and transfer over your BTC as you see fit. Diversity is key during these high-traffic times.

Don't blink, we'll be back up and past 4300 before you know it. Enjoy the ride and Hodl.

Looking strongly like this prediction is panning out.

It is to your benefit to report a loss (to a certain extent) because it goes in your favor. There is, however a yearly limit.

I have a little cash that I like to play with on a seperate exchange. I currently HODL on Coinbase (for the time being) and have a bitstamp account that I buy low, sell high. It's a little nerve racking, but I'm made a little money doing it. Right now I'm down a bit on that account because I bought back in yesterday at 10300 against my gut feeling. If you have patience, you're likely to make money if you time it right, but it's always a gamble.

there are two categories of capital gains. Long term and short term. Short term is under a year. Long term is over a year. Short term is taxed at a higher rate (about 25%) and longterm has a shorter rate. Use google to find exactly what I'm talking about. Consult a professional tax agency or accountant to ensure you are filing your taxes correctly.

gdax or bitstamp. Low fees too.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:37:48
again, check with an accountant, but technically, yes, you have to report it. View it as a barter/exchange.

If you're in the US, follow capital gains taxes once you sell. Any increase in value is taxable by both the IRS and state level depending on your state. Keep track of any new money you put into crypto.

GDAX is up and down. Stay patient, but yes, I think something fishy is going on with the exchanges.

Seems like a whale is taking a dump again...

In this regard, it's almost like having a Visa or American Express in your wallet. If a place doesn't take Amex, then you can use your Visa. If a place doesn't take LTC then you can just use BTC instantaneously.
