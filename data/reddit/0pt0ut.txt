It is indeed, third line of the bitcoin whitepaper.
If I recall correctly, there was a period where gmx was advertising aggressively to try to increase their user base, so it is not necessarily indicative that Satoshi was German. It's possible though!

Yes, it's posted on his website. You can generate addresses until you get one you like, they're called 'vanity' addresses. Vanitygen is one such tool you can use to get your own, but be careful running code you don't understand on your own machine. Caveat emptor.

I just watched this whole interview. It was alright, nothing really new at all though. I agree with Peter on most of the topics. Same old anti-bitcoin arguments from Peter towards the end. Like so many others, he seems to capitulate to the benefits of the blockchain while continuing to proclaim that bitcoin can't work and has no value. A few minutes later he states that people can use Bitcoin to buy gold on his(?) goldmoney website.

Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places, could be forked to be more divisible if required. The world could hypothetically operate on one bitcoin, or less.

Miners will always receive some kind of reward for solving blocks. Currently, miners receive a block reward in addition to a relatively small amount of fees; but eventually we will see fees become the primary source of miner income.
Mining will always be profitable for the miners with the best hardware / cheapest electricity. Should mining become less profitable, fewer users will attempt to mine. This will continue until it is profitable for the remaining miners. So the miners with the best hardware and cheapest electricity will persevere.

Bitcoin is a consensus network. If you run code with different rules, you are part of a different network. August 1^st has come and gone, the two networks are running independently of each-other.
There are now people who own bcash, people who own bitcoin, and people who own both. bcash being forked from bitcoin's chain doesn't make it a part of bitcoin any more than litecoin, which forked off the idea of bitcoin and changed a few other small parameters.
You need to understand that the two are different. Bitcoin has unique consensus rules which the market believes have value. Network rules are really the only differences between cryptos, they are the distinct property which gives a cryptocurrency value. When you choose to buy bitcoin or bcash, you are choosing to support the idea, the 'rules' of that network.

Did you download wallet software, or store your coins on a website?
If you downloaded software, you will need to access the harddrive you downloaded the software on and look for a wallet file (look for 'wallet.dat').
If you used an online wallet you might have used blockchain.info, search your email for messages from them.
If you used a different online service your coins are likely gone. Good luck!

Mining should always be profitable for those with the cheapest electricity and the best hardware. 
If mining is not profitable for an individual, he has a disincentive to mine and should turn off his machines. This in turn makes it easier for others to mine profitably. 
The opposite is true as well. If an individual can profit by mining bitcoin, he will do so. This makes it more difficult for all other miners to mine profitably.
These incentives keep mining profit margins thin, but profitable. Equilibrium.
The halving schedule tells us that tx fees will be the primary incentive to mine blocks long before the last bits are mined.

bcash is not bitcoin. 
Different rules, different network. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:11:08
The fork resulted in two networks, not two bitcoins. Are you saying that any fork of bitcoin should still be considered bitcoin, no matter how massive the changes in that fork may be? Where do you draw the line?
Also I just wanted to say that I'm not trying to be argumentative, just trying to clarify my viewpoint. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:04:03


So any blockchain which shares any part of bitcoin's blockchain history should be considered bitcoin as well, no matter how radical the changes?
Say for example the fed decides to fork bitcoin, but instead of being limited to 21 million units, it states that fedcoin units will continue to be generated to an address that the fed itself controls, forever. Like in previous forks, everyone with a bitcoin balance also receives a balance on the fedcoin chain.
Now I, and I think most others believe that 21 million units is one bitcoin's defining features. The fact that such a chain might share a history with bitcoin should be irrelevant. Certainly you can see a point where it becomes important to be able to distinguish between different chains, different rulesets?

You see me now a veteran of a thousand bitcoin shorts.
I've been shorting btc so long, while the price of bitcoin soars..
And I'm sure it's going to zero,
And it's just a ponzi scheme, 
all my trades were done on margin..
I'm not sure if I've got any more money.
Don't let bitcoin go on!

I've mentioned bitcoin to so many people over the years, I can say that one of the first questions people usually ask is how much I have. I think this is because at first, people see it as a get rich quick scheme and want to know how much I've made. My go-to response is to jokingly say 'not enough', they usually will let that topic drop and the conversation can continue. If they continue to prod, you can ask them how much money they have in their bank account, that usually manages to change the topic as well.

I'll start off by saying I don't 'know' anything, I just follow the space and read articles / user submissions. If you really look for them, I bet you could find at least one thread per day complaining about a Coinbase account closure, and most of these are probably due to TOS violations. If we're 'seeing' those, there must be many more closures that we don't see. I don't think they are making 'requests' for data, that's too inefficient. Something on this scale is very likely automated. If I had to guess, I'd say Coinbase and a number of other large bitcoin services are providing info to some third party such as [chainalysis]( which tries to 'fill in the blanks' as much as possible. If chainalysis can determined an 'unacceptable' transaction has occurred, it simply notifies the services, who then close the account and probably put the user on a list somewhere. Coinbase doesn't even need to provide chainalysis with actual customer names either, unique identifiers would be sufficient.
The bitcoin blockchain is not anonymous, at best it is pseudonymous.
That's my current working hypothesis anyway.

Do you sell / spend your BTC? My guess would be that the next link in the chain (after you) is sharing info with coinbase. Hard to say without more info though.

They may be referring to an older tx, can you say you have never sent or received BTC from a gambling site? Not just within one hop either.
It sucks, but it seems like CB has more business than they need at the moment. Stories like yours have been a daily routine for more than a year now. Coinbase needs some real competition, by going elsewhere you can help decentralize the marketplace.

Can you clarify how exactly your husband got scammed? 
Think of a credit card as a 'pull' system. Anyone who has your credit card info can 'pull' money from your card if they choose to. This doesn't happen often because there are penalties for credit card fraud, but I digress.
Bitcoin is the opposite, a 'push' system, if you will. The only way to get Bitcoin to move is for the owner (person who has the private keys) to broadcast a transaction to the network.
So unless your husband's computer or device was compromised, he must have been complicit in sending any amount of BTC.
Mycelium keeps a transaction history for each account (there may be more than one), but without context it won't tell you much about where the money went. All you'll see is x.xxxx BTC moved from address A to address B on a given date.
Mycelium can be configured to require a pin before opening, if he doesn't want you to get in to his wallet you probably won't be able to.

How did you arrange this trade? Localbitcoins holds your btc in escrow, meaning you don't release the coins until you receive the cash. Wouldn't stop them from pulling a gun on you or something, but should be sufficient to stop someone from running away with your money.

If it's really bothering you and you think the money will improve your life, go ahead and divest a percentage of your holdings. You earned it.
I personally don't have any desire to sell the BTC I have. I might consider selling if it would put me in a position to retire (not happening any time soon). I feel like if I still have to go in to work next week, nothing's really changed and I'm not interested in USD. Also, selling will incur a tax penalty, meaning even less incentive for me to cash out. I'll just let it ride.
