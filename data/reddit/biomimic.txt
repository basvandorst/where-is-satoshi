Can't argue with the references in the article.

There should be an interesting way to leverage or engage in arbitrage between a public companies stock and the alternative currency they are active in.

The headline for all that's going on here reminds me of 'Bitcoin supporters clash over ideological, practical issues'

Good for other cryptos too

I'm thinking that spreading risk across both bitcoin as an asset and the stock as a security might work to alleviate or better balance the overall risk.

If someone has a calculation for this out there that would be good. I'm looking to apply it to a few others.

wire transfer, bitcoin, songcoin, dogecoin, etc  acceptance doesn't make it a joke necessarily

I think the point here is that Bitcoin is ultimately responsible for such a positive change. Without it, we would never see this kind of change potential for the artists and music. Every coin will have it's own strategy. Getting one of the co-architects of Namecoin along with Cisco and JP Morgan guys on board can also be a good thing if steered in the right direction. I like the credit card illustration in the article. The artists certainly need someone to step forward for them and I think this is a step in the right direction.

I'll research that approach, thanks.

US Bitcoin stocks: [CHAG]( and [BTCS]( quietly appearing in the US markets so far. The Bitcoin ETF is not ready yet. I see these as a good way to hedge especially considering the recent Ghash debacle.

Naked shorting can drive the price down in the overall market resulting in illogical swings in price activity. Hedge or leverage with public company stock if possible. We were discussing it here

Best to worry about black swan events as opposed to speculating on what is a bubble and what is not.

Ha, Wall St. is ready to move forward with Bitcoin in big way. Bye Bye naysayers.

I suppose you could buy a little more of one or a little less of the other or buy them both equally to diversify.
