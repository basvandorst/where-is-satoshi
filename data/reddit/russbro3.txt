Why do we go to the grocery store when it would be cheaper to hunt or grow our own food? Convenience, humans love paying extra for things that are convenient and coinbase is just that.

Yeah asking an 18 year old straight out of highschool to begin his life as an adult 40k in debt. Sounds pretty evil to me 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:13:14
Doesn't quite work like that on the US unfortunately

Go to GDAX click deposit, go to the category deposit from coinbase wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:27:21
Yeah but how are you going to move it to a segwit supported exchange from a non segwit exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:55:12
There's like 200k unconfirmed transactions, the higher the fee the quicker it gets confirmed. I think coinbase sets the tx rate when transferring out to transfer asap.

Nobody can pick up the housing market after the former generations destroyed it, we just have to deal with the mess you left behind. Which is fine, that's what were doing here bro, no hard feelings we'll take care of it. Sit back and enjoy the show :)

Im not in debt, because I took an alternate route... but I see plenty of people who graduated with a degree and 10s of thousands of dollars in debt because they were told they had to go to college to make a living. I dropped out and worked my way up a fast food chain into the corporate world. But when i had just graduated highschool I wasnt educated to see those other options. School wasn't for me, and I wish it weren't shoved down everyone's throat.
You though, continue to live in the country you've destroyed and leave it to the millienals to pick up your disastrous housing market, your dollar that you destroyed. Continue to blame the people that will have to deal with your mistakes. It's not me that I'm worried about buddy. It's the world that you'll leave behind.

You could just buy a burner. Yeah it would cost some money, but anonymity isn't free

Those companies are all trademarked, crypto is not. Although I do agree you can't fix stupid and you shouldnt invest if you don't know what you're investing jn
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:53:10
At least in the US the previous two generations have destroyed the dollar and the housing market. So they kind of had it coming
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:11:13
I think it has something to do with making their investment back quicker. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:20:27
If you're going to troll at least make it a decent troll

It's not about the present, but about the future. This has potential to be the biggest financial revolution in who the fuck knows how long. If bitcoin succeeds the people win, unless you work for a banking institution or are a government that can no longer print its own money. 
People who have no bitcoin now may be all paid via bitcoin in the future. Whether it's bitcoin that succeeds or not it's the tech that is groundbreaking.

Yeah you're not really the person he was describing. You didn't really miss out, you saw gains. The average person hearing about this from a tech savvy friend and buying in with 0 knowledge of the tech behind it or why it has value is buying so he doesn't get left out from the gains his friend is currently making. Not realizing that the 1000+% years are probably over. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:04:25
That's customer service right there folks. If I lived in an area that could be profitable in a reasonable time I'd totally ve coming to you!

Depending on where your from coinbase is very quick with a credit card still has high fees, but lower than an atm
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:48:53
1k-2k jumps become less and less significant the larger the cost
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:55:24
It would be better, but if coinbase is hacked, I'm pretty sure your USD worth is insured
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:13:40
How does that make it any less convenient? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:23:17
Paying someone in bitcoin instead doesn't have to decrease your bitcoin holdings. You owe someone 50 bucks and they want bitcoin instead of cash, you use the 50 bucks you wouldve given them and buy that much worth in bitcoin and transfer it. Youre basically saying why use currency for anything other than buying bitcoin to hold 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:43:32
And then you have everyone waiting for that, buying it all up during a crash raising the price back up. 
The exchanges own most of the bitcoin. Not really people per say
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:13:29
Feeling of missing out
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:35:07
Well that's what happens when you depend on someone else to secure your money for you
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:11:49
Comparing apples to oranges really. A store of value that's been around for a 1k+ years compared to a currency that is still in its infancy? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:59:00
Lol sorry I didn't realize i was arguing with stupid, good luck to ya buddy
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:27:08
It's not a currency currently. Hopefully soon it will be, but with high tx fees it isn't feasible at the moment. It's current use is only a store of value, which is why people are holding instead of using it.
 Once it hits the moon. Thousand dollar swings won't really change the value of satoshis all that much. Bitcoin is about the future, not necessarily the present
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:29:07
Well what did you expect to happen?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:27:18
You can certainly breed live stock ? And idk how your opinion of your homemade chocolate is relevant. If grocery stores weren't convenient they wouldn't be used
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:50:07
Literally spend your entire childhood saying you need to go to college to make it in life by the school system you are forced to go to. 
Constantly told by the media how little income you would have without a college degree. then they ask you to take out a huge loan to pay for everything while you probably haven't been taught much about investments or how to properly manage money, because mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, which is apparently extremely vital information.
 Yeah I think the whole system at least in the US is pretty shit and directs you down a path that isn't as beneficial as you are led to believe. I mean shit, you aren't even considered responsible enough to buy a beer at that age.
