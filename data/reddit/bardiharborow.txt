We are developing tools now, the coinflow client is really clunky, we aim to have a javascript application on a website that will be a social network.

They can't alter the records, as in change them, but they can remove records. Potentially you could have a rolling sha1 hash that updated every record to be `sha1(last_hash + new_post)`.

Nice! I'll look into it. Doesn't look like there is a implementation of this. Could be a nice project! :)
**EDIT:** Oh, read down further, looks like there is a implementation. If only it was peer-to-peer... *evil laugh*

You could always use brainwallet.org to hand craft a transaction with a smaller fee and push it to the network. This may take a while to go through but it should eventually.

As I said, it is only 11 GB. Secondly, what do you mean by:


@_date: 2013-11-28 05:58:46
I'm aware of this, that is why bootstrap.dat has the following features:
1. Verifies all blocks.
2. Ignores blocks above the latest checkpoint (compiled-in blockhash)
Also, it would be the offical version from [here]( so you could verify the SHA-256 or SHA-1 hash.
Additionally, there is no difference between using bootstrap.dat and syncing as normal as:
1. The blocks are fed thru the same verification system.
2. Bitcoind would just proceed to sync the main chain anyway and as long as you waited until the client reported that it had finished syncing, then you would be safe.

Hey! There are still some kids these days, you are right about there being less but there are still some. I'm 14 for example, and have been programming for about 5 years.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:18:09
You seem to have misunderstood me. I was trying to discuss a potential product for tech guys who want to have a copy of the blockchain but have crappy internet. The average user doesn't even know what bootstrap.dat is and may not know what the blockchain is either.
I believe this whole misunderstanding came from the fact that you believe that the "tech guy" already has the blockchain downloaded. I completely agree with your "probably the biggest obstacle to mainstream adoption" statement and I apologise if you feel I was being a smart aleck.
It would appear that I mistook you for a troll and didn't really engage, sorry.

Only to some extent, assuming 250 bytes per input, you could fit 40 inputs in a tx and have *no* fees (if all outputs are over 0.01 and have a large enough priority).

Oh, yes I know PHP as I've done a lot of web stuff. Although I've never dealt with C. What do you suggest the best way to learn C would be (I have access to linux if that makes a difference)?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:26:00
I would probably have to say python, seeing is that is what I've used the most. JavaScript was a pain until recently when I got a proper IDE (I was using notepad). Java is also pretty good if you use Eclipse. I do my 2D games in Java.

Ok guys, not sure you are getting the point. Let's talk about SocialNet, our first idea to use NetVend for something useful. SocialNet will be just as the name suggests, social network. A bitcoin based social network to be precise.
Using the data command on NetVend users can post things as anonymously or no as they chose. There will be a lot of spam posted . To filter out this spam you tip people you like the content of. Then you see only the content of them and people they have tipped (to a lesser degree) and people those people have tipped (to an even lesser degree, out to n-th degree tipping.
Not only does this reward users with good content, it filters out spam and makes the whole SocialNet experience better.
Not sure if left out anything, but I would just say that he dosn't have seemed to mention that this in some ways is a fully verifiable off-blockchain payment processor. Also remember that you can tip from 0 sSats (less than a satoshi) to infinity BTC (well, 21 million actually). So it is a **fully verifiable off-blockchain macro-and-mirco-payment processor**.

Hi Guys,
As said I have been helping. I also wrote the APIs. Feel free to ask me any questions! how on earth do you write so much!!

Some people are indeed, i actually tried to import the key into my wallet!

Most of the inputs were 25 satoshis each (someone's idea of blockchain spam). Lots of clients kept freezing at the sight of so many UXTOs and blockchain.info refused to give details of the ouputs until recently.

People are *so* harsh. I gave you a +1. I agree that:

Your statement has a couple of flaws:
1. This is not for the "joe sixpack user".
2. This is not a discussion regarding the user-friendliness of the main client.
3. This is a discussion regarding the usefulness of a USB stick containing a copy of the blockchain to preprime the client.
4. The "joe sixpack user" doesn't have to remember a "a sixty character alphanumeric private key".
    1. A bitcoin private key in Wallet Import Format is 51 characters, not 60 (sorry to be picky).
    2. The "joe sixpack user" doesn't have to remember it as the client will for them.
Without sounding like a smart alec, please show a level of understanding before criticising.

Bitcoin will not gain legitimacy as a real currency and will be considered a toy for geeks and drug dealers if real business accept it. And anyway, how am I going to withdraw my money from adf.ly if they don't accept bitcoin, paypal is way too annoying (dna scans me thinks).

For a moment I thought the link said, lets **stalk** bitcoin. I have used your site in the past. It's nice!

That would be better if it is possible.

Oh, that is a bit confusing. Syriven made some changes so that data is stored in different tables and I'm not completely across that. That is something we are considering removing in NetVend 2.0. I was referring to the VARCHAR(5000) because I had forgotten about the multiple tables thing.

As mentioned, 2.0 is coming, with new APIs and plenty of documentation. Also, the JS client was all working, but some server changes were made and it is probably not any more. I'm busy working on NetVend 2.0 but if you can figure out what is broken and send a pull request. =)

Polling is something I've considered, but it has yet to be implemented. So is allowing you to query the server for fees. Something like a GET request to `/fees.php`, not to check individual commands but to get the rules for fees. The current plan is to release NetVend 2.0 with a whole bunch of changes (including some non-backwards compatible changes) before the 100k bounty deadline. Think of NetVend 1.0 as a prototype.

Blockchain seems to be up from my end. However, their "Latest Transactions" thing on the homepage is blank, which could indicates a restart. As far as other service support goes, [my BitcoinTalk post]( talks about a web wallet that could connect to any obelisk server (anyone can run one easily).

In order to have different tables, syriven removed the text from history.command. Also, history.signed is always 65 chars long.

At a basic level you can store data (post), send micro-transactions (tip), execute SQL queries on the DB (query) and withdraw you money (withdraw). You can build what ever you want on top of that. We really don't know where this will go, but we feel it has huge potential.

NetVend has huge potential to do whatever you want to to do. The above mentioned system is just one version, but you can setup your own with whatever rules you want. We really don't know all the things netvend can do, but we are excited to see what you all come up with.

NetVend allows for instant payments, hopefully more securely than Inputs.io. We are currently developing some test-cases, which should clarify things. I'll get to see if he can answer this better.

In NetVend 2.0 (currently under development) we use TEXT to store posts, so that will work.
