Anyone can contribute to core.

I'm in favor of SegWit2x but don't really care about the 2x. I just feel that 2x was a reasonable compromise to get SegWit activated and am worried that Bitcoin's progress will stall indefinitely if miners feel like they got tricked (no, SegWit did not get activated because of UASF lol).
I also think that core's refusal to go along with the compromise and the rest of the community was really disappointing and I want core to realize that it doesn't get to unilaterally decide on Bitcoin's roadmap. Sadly, their refusal was politically motivated more than anything else.

That is true but it is also true of all Bitcoin development decisions ever (unless you are one of those people:  Luckily, a bunch of people that are heavily invested in Bitcoin were present. The best you can do is vote with your money or hash rate. You can vote against SegWit2x but doing so just because you weren't there is really misguided.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:08:12
That is FUD of the pure kind, sir.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:38:50




It's all a power struggle. Up until recently, core had been in charge of Bitcoin's roadmap. This authority was recently challenged after a bunch of key ecosystem members (majority of miners and large Bitcoin startups) got together and agreed on Segwit2x (bypassing core's decision process). Of course, core didn't take it very well and won't compromise no matter the cost.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:49:37
Nothing. Loud minority and censorship on this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:39:45
If your argument is that bigger blocks lead to centralization, that would make you against SegWit too? Did you stop using bitcoin after SegWit got activated?
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:48:25


Me too. That's not what Segwit2x is though. That's propaganda that has been fed to you by bitcoin core.


@_date: 2017-11-08 05:49:39

And by Bitcoin hero, you mean shitcoin promoter?
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:05:01
There is a difference. The NYA was organized by some of the largest Bitcoin stakeholders, users and a majority of miners. Core's decision making is largely done by a small group of early Bitcoin core contributors. The reason the NYA happened in the first place was because core was unable to rally the community behind their roadmap.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:54:30
If that's true, why target that guy and not a core dev? Apart from posting cheesy tweets, I don't think he is a bitcoin core collaborator or in a position to significantly influence hard fork debates.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:43:14


I'm sorry everyone, but my bullshit meter is extremely high after reading this. There was basically no "fintech" way before 2011.
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:33:52
Sure ��
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:38:53
I should clarify what I meant: core's refusal to compromise never was about the 2mb blocks. 
It's about showing that they alone get to call the shots on bitcoin's development roadmap. Industry wide agreements don't mean shit to them.

Do you mean there's no such thing as "core developers"? And by extension, no "what core developers support"? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:15:11
It also means the chain will be vulnerable to 51%/replay attacks. There is also a risk that a large miner might maliciously stall the chain indefinitely (basically, prevent any transaction from confirming).
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:58:46
will you follow the Segwit2x chain if it becomes the economic majority?

There is no need to spread FUD. If you don't run a full node, you can still send and accept Bitcoin payments. I don't think anyone in Bitcoin history ever got scammed because they were using a SPV wallet.

A few ex core developers are. A lot of non core developers are. Also, while Satoshi Nakamoto didn't comment on the coming hard fork, he did favor hard forking in the future to increase the block size. Current core devs are against it by definition (being in favor would mean ceasing to be a core developer). Finally, a few current core developers have admitted that they are mainly against it for political reasons, not technical ones.

The length of a chain is measured in terms of cumulative PoW, not number of blocks. A 1 block chain can be longer than a 2 blocks chain.
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:30:32
A big part of considers Segwit2x supporters as "attackers that want to centralize or destroy Bitcoin" (there's even an "enemies of bitcoin" lists that gets reposted in every other thread). Sadly, that leads to a lot of self censorship and it's something to keep in mind at such events.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:15:28
How about a post on what hash rate is and why the legacy chain will become unsafe and vulnerable to 51% attacks after the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:22:40


There's a simple solution to this attack... Follow the chain with the most hash rate. Come on, you'd rather change the PoW than double the block size? Serious?

If you can't figure it out after a while and give up, post your passphrase here and maybe someone will figure it out and be kind enough to send you the BTC back.
