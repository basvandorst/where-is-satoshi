_nightengale_ makes a very valid point in that regulatory clarity is a prerequisite for an "institutional Bitcoin exchange". 
We have experienced anything but regulatory clarity in the USA. What we have seen is a non cohesive and disjointed approach by several key regulatory bodies in an evolving regulatory environment which sometimes exhibits precious little or no understanding of the very structure which is to be regulated. 
To move forward one needs a stable operating business environment with the capability to be internationally competitive. This, for USA based bitcoin exchange firms, does not exist. This is why there are no major bitcoin exchanges in the USA. One only has to look at bitcoinity marketshare data to see the facts.
Many major bitcoin exchanges are located offshore. They have moved to Hong Kong, Singapore, British Virgin Islands and elsewhere. The sole USA exception is Kraken from San Francisco California who has commanding marketshare in $BTCEUR.
USA Regulators need to understand bitcoin before they speak and act. Until they do, there will be more of the same.

An ultra low cost rebittance app. Half a trillion dollar market, but more importantly, a good cause &amp; genuinely needy and potentially appreciative recipients. Vastly more "aid" is sent thru remittance than all foreign aid programs combined. Remittance loses value in transaction costs of 8% or higher which represents a huge sum of wasted funds. Offering a low cost rebittance app can help millions of ppl in real life situations. If its started now it will be finished sooner.

Kraken, the leading bitcoin exchange for euro trading, is based in San Francisco, California, USA. 
Coindesk tracks only a fraction of the total bitcoin market. Bitcoin.info tracks ALL markets &amp; all data:
 
There is a substantive volume of $btc trading already in the USA on several exchanges.
The estimated Mt.Gox value been pegged by some at 470 million which is not unsimilar to a recent credit card case in Mexico in which a subsidiary defrauded its parent of similar value with little or no media concern about the 'legitimacy' of its underlying currency.
According to its website Bitstamp.net is based in:
5 New Street Square
London EC4A 3TW
United Kingdom
Lawsky’s plan is NOT seen as a template for legislation in other jurisdictions. It is seen as yet another New York style aberration and the exception, not the norm. Based on their actions, financial regulators do not understand how bitcoin works.

Sarah, part of the answer to your question: FYI  posts global bitcoin price with built in currency converter including hkd php btc its all on one page here KittyBitcoin.com/tickers/bpi.php . So for example if you want to know the current global price of bitcoin denominated in philippine peso just click on the scroller and scroll to the desired currency, ordered alphabetically.
