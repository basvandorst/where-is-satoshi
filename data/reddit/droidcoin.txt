Makes no sense, but what does in the BitCoin universe, wallets for iOS &amp; Android should always be launched with any website utilizing BitCoin. If you cant carry your coins on your person even if just for the physical proximity fixation, i mean really limiting the market.

This needs to be adopted and promoted in the USA. 
Many people still don't iwn a smart phone, they're only now becoming affordable, yet Obama has made it to where everyone should have a cell phone if you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you. Now those unbanked, under privileged folks living in the fringes can have access to the Bitcoin protocol, and be one steps closer to financial freedom.

@_date: 2015-01-23 02:23:50
They're not that new, but definitely going to grow fast as more and more users are preferring their process of trading versus a lot of the popular ones, its almost like local trading but at stamp rate without any fees. That high sudden volume is where their services will be tested at. I hope they come through, they are my new preferred method to trade.

@_date: 2015-01-17 05:56:41
Yeah but they're not everywhere USA yet?. I too was wondering whats taking so long, i mean there's a million little check cashing/money transmitting buisnesses out there that could serve as the venue to catapult a service that tight.
@_date: 2015-01-17 06:05:08
I've traded there, the local trades is where its at, cheaper more anonymous if you just do the whole trade off LBC. Mycelium the same. But the online trade methods like pre paid cards, WU, etc., are shamelessly taxed by all players and on top of that swamped with scammers getting away with it more often than not. Maybe they should adopt the DNM framework, mostly escrow, 2FA, encrypt sensitive info like scratch off numbers or WU codes, PGP verifications, i bet that would tiddy up LBC and restore trust in new and vet traders.
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:50:43
Have you used it? Is it like old school bitinstant?, looks easier from the instructions on their web site.
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:57:51
Having you own website is the key. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:32:58

I manually entered the address on the block chain and it also worked that way.
It's strange.
@_date: 2015-10-12 12:25:42
It's when you physically try and show someone how awesome BTC is that it fails lol.  Same thing happened to me with Mycellium, I was showing someone and the double spend attacks started to happen.
@_date: 2015-03-20 11:49:33
I know, I mean, I just tried to send a friend .80cents.
He gave me his address and I attempted to input the address "Manually" from Mycelium Wallet on Droid.
When I got to the last digit to enter it wouldn't let me and it staid in red saying "Invalid Address".  
I was able to just point the camera to the QR code from the blockchain though.  
Guessing I found an error on the wallet?
@_date: 2015-10-12 01:00:14
Guess I'm not as lucky.
My wild guess is that it's the weekend and that's why support has not got back with me on the issue.

That's crazy?  There is actually a team working on this, giving the artist the opportunity to receive direct payment with BTC so they know when their "consignment" piece has been sold and receive the money directly.  With multi-sig, would it not be possible for the venue holding the art piece on consignment to receive a fee from the sale?

I have ignored it, app still works fine without the update.  
I did uninstall &amp; re install and noticed that if you re install from GooglePlay, you still have the old version and the app still warns you that you should update.  So I have left it alone until Google Play has the official update.  
Mycellium has been my choice wallet for Android for a while, but the update currently advertised is useless and should not be advertised in my opinion.  Advertised updates are usually something important not trivial.
