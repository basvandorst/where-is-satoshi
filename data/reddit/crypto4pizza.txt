Bitcoin is short for bitconnect, therefore it is a scam.

Half a bitcoin is better than no bitcoin. :) Still trying to reach that 1 BTC. Goal by end of the year.

I recently just started coding on Freecodecamp, and I was actually happy to see and understand the web development part of video such as descriptions, adding buttons, and listings.
Overall, cool little video and paywall.

If you have your banking account linked to coinbase, you can do direct deposit (that does take 7-10 business days). After it is successfully deposited, you can transfer (the transfer from CB to GDAX is less than 1-3min wait time) the cash to GDAX (coinbase exchange) and purchase bitcoin with fees under $1 for any amount. But only if you have the patience and time. :) Every little BTC counts.

The first thing I bought using Bitcoin was a Ledger Nano S. Since then, I've been trying to get at least 1 bitcoin and hold it. Lock it up.
Any amount of BTC after that will use it for financial reasons.
