Damage her image with the gov't bureaucracies that are harassing her.  They put Al Capone away for tax evasion.

Wait till the supreme court decides corporations don't have to follow laws that are against the religious principles of the founders.  ALEC or the US Chamber of Commerce will found a religion that holds a no taxes/public support, pollutiness is next to godliness, etc. belief.  Adopt that religion and found a corporation.

Good luck with the energy efficient RV.  Even small RVs seem to be locked in to 7 - 10 MPG.
You'll also need to plan ahead on where you park overnight.  Many cities are cracking down on overnight parking and even national parks are limiting how long you can stay.  You don't want to end up living in truck stop parking lots.

Didn't MF Global take customer funds to pay creditors?  I'm guessing it was legal because [no one was prosecuted](

I almost bought some 2 G/H USB miners off of eBay today.  They were $29 or best offer.  I submitted an offer of 24.99, clicked send, then went to the ROI calculator.
Pretty glad they rejected my offer, because the payback time was never ever ever.

Many reports are saying a ruling in their favor could result in other decisions denying religious exemptions being overturned.

Start browsing the full time RV forums, lots of good advice on where to stay, maintenance, what to avoid, and RV solar setups.  Many there are saying they are being harassed by rangers for staying longer than X days when boondocking in national forests, even when moving around.
With new lithium batteries EV RVs are closer to being possible, but still pretty far away IMO.
Have you considered towing a pop-up or micro camper with an EV or hybrid?  You'll be closer to your goal from the start, and the hybrid can be hacked for use as a generator/storage system.

Seriously. Parts for that drive aren't becoming more available and the magnetic image continues to decay.

When you sell BTC, where or what do you keep the proceeds in so you can buy back in quickly?

For the people who it isn't obvious too (which included me), the [MtGox]( smart phone 2-factor uses [Google Authenticator](
Install it, snap a shot of the QR code, and you are ready to secure your account

It's also common for the bank's people to tell the borrower they don't need to read the contract, it's all standard stuff.
If this happens to you, put down the pen and read it again (because you already read it once, right?!), they either changed something or you missed the part where they screw you.
