Yes, as a former New Yorker and current ex-pat I'd really like to see bitcoin development and business happen outside the coercive force of the US / Wall street too. It's my belief it will make the future of bitcoin too centralized and easy to regulate.

Hey Matt,
I really like the contributions you make the the community and your work, but surely developers will beget those very companies. At which point they'll need to choose whether to stay in an area where they've already built up infrastructure and support networks. 
Shouldn't that whole problem be avoided now? while it can be?
Looking further into Chainlabs I see they are ex. Hudson River Trading co. (I used to work in the Quant Trading field as well).
Doesn't it worry  you that you'll be doing this work within the heart of the existing finance world, with all the ethics that come along with such an environment?

This is just a natural progression of any new idea, people are going to go into it for a variety of reasons. In fact this diverse motivation is necessary for robust ecosystem. You may not like the speculators but they do more for bitcoin marketing and interest than alpaca socks every will.

While I think half of this is very speculative and half of this is good trend analysis, to grow bitcoin to where this author sees it the best method is still to add value to the network. That means doing more than mere speculation, buy and hold, etc. It means getting out there and using bitcoin, creating acceptance of it worldwide and also reducing the volatility of it. THIS is the way to achieve the OP's dream quicker and grow the network effect reliably.

Except no one understood why you felt the need to disrupt a normal comment to do so. 
Here's an analogy for how what you just did, looked like:
Sir_Wabbit and I are in a coffee house having a conversation. From the next table you lean over and say "I peed in your coffee". We look at each other and go "Wtf?" and you reply with "Haha only joking! Don't be so sensitive." 
The point isn't so much what you said, it's that you felt it perfectly acceptable to say something antagonistic merely to draw attention to yourself.
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:03:46
No the position you've created in your mind allows you no other option obviously. It was immediately apparent as soon as you responded to confusion you created with a flippant "har har". I harbour no illusions about you ability to recognize any sort of pattern to your own behaviour or contemplate introspectively about such matters. Even your last few responses have been watered down versions of the same refrain. Ultimately your thinking is stunted, mostly like your humour.

Step one of course is **some** method for bootstrapping a network of trust similiar to hawala's which is mostly based on blood relatives or "village" trust. The beauty is I think we can solve this by using multi-sig transactions or at the very least escrow. I'm certainly not going to reneg on a transfer of 5btc if I've got 50btc tied up in escrow. What blind spots am I missing on this idea?

I'd say the massive downvotes "kept it real". Ultimately you're responsible for what you say. You seem not to equate your comments with any negative reprecussions. Yes, you're allowed to say whatever you want, doesn't mean people won't judge you for it nor decide to not associate with you for it.

Actually this++ 100%. I was lucky to invest in physical rig (avalon-asic  and made back what went into it and a bit more. Would I do it now? never! huge order queue, shipping delays, risk of difficulty increase and small return just don't add up unless you can scale to many many units. cex.io allows common folk to partake in mining that could otherwise not do so.

@_date: 2014-09-16 17:27:58
actually I believe similiar, that the existance of two many altcoins and exchanges willing to trade them to bitcoin is deflating value from bitcoin, it's also having a nice side affect of reducing volatility though. Plus there's nothing anyone to do to stop the proliferation of altcoins anyway (except eventually make it not even worth the time involved in inventing non-novel new ones)
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:01:54

I see you're at it again Adrian, I thought this would finally convince of the qualitative difference between the two groups of developers but alas! 
It's not a **lack of communication** as you say, core is under to obligation to help BU fix their code base, as it's mostly a waste of their valuable time. 
You should be rejecting BU because of what it **represents**, that BU doesn't have the time, manpower or skill to introduce and manage a change into the bitcoin project in a competent fashion. How can you not see this already?

Why should core devote it's precious time to helping those who refuse to listen to rational argument and waste others time with propaganda campaigns. The smartest thing they could do would be to ignore them.

again, this is entirely common practice in almost all open source projects.

It's not ad hominem at all in this case, these developers left a larger much more capable team in order to push a short term destructive solution over a longer more well thought out roadmap. It's entirely indicative or their qualities and priorities as developers. 
The fact is those 100 developers **have** come up with something that's great. 
The fact that BU routinely relies on vote brigading and propaganda to push their specific talking points, instead of relying on convincing technical dialogue, cements their agenda for most of us.

This post is **exactly** the same metric I use when evaluating others in the bitcoin space (see CSW) when I cannot fathom the math or programming.

I completely disagree, **using** bitcoin for purchases gives infinitely more value to the community (and businesses that support bitcoin) that people just hodling and speculating endlessly.

I too am very intrigued by this. As of my writing btc1 is 7200, btc2 is 145. Btc is at 7331. I put a bitcoin in I'd get 1 token of each which I could then swap back to btc and make 1btc + $14. How is that possible?

No its an idiot. That's a lamassu machine, there's only a tablet and bill acceptor inside. The hot wallet and workings all reside on a remote backend.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:47:39
this is trivial to do, you just set the API backend no to accept connections from anything except the IP you've originally set up with it. You might even implement something that notices if the machine is unaccountable for more than 5 minutes and shuts down the API backend. 
 Though I guess you could just setup an active GPS if you're really worried.

Maybe you should actually try purchasing a game on steam before speaking about what you know nothing about. The purchases happen instantaneously every time. These are harsh opinions for an account created merely 3 weeks ago and that's already fallen for a ICO scam. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:01:33
this is unnecessary since the owner who runs the backend already knows the machine is stolen. Additionally they'd have the new IP of the machine connection that would aid in tracking it.

UGH **THANK YOU** for saying this. I couldn't agree more, for bitcoin to accelerate adoption it must be seen as a legitimate alternative for all people not just libertarians or revolutionaries.

Again I must re-iterate, nothing you've said **proves** capital controls are coming. You may speculate all you want the direction the country is going but it is once again **speculation** unless you can point to an actual announcement of capital controls. More specifically many of your above points are contradictory or just plain incorrect. For instance double taxation for US citizens is nothing new and while the US is well known for it other countries do this as well. While corporate tax rates vary by state and jurisdiction they're still some of the [lowest]( in the world. 
Without accurately knowing how many Hispanics are in the US illegally how could you then claim that more are entering than leaving? 


Please what an obviously dismissive statement, just because I don't share the view that the sky is falling doesn't make it necessarily true.

Yes I remember this, but it also cuts to the root of what I'm saying re: pkg's vs static binaries.

They even scaled back their vehicles for now for space tourism vs space vehicles/transport. So I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here.

sorry you have **half** the story correct. My country (the USA) has been getting increasingly fascist in the last decade. I've left to move to a Nordic country in the hope of preparing some of their people to ward off the misguided legislation from the US. They **have** capital controls here due to embezzlement and corruption in the banks here and over leveraging the krona. You don't have capital controls in the US nor will you anytime in the near future. Confirming [Godwins Law]( does not prove you are right nor make you correct. It merely proves you're good at overgeneralizing and perhaps bad at trend analysis. However if you insist that capital controls are coming to the USA I'll be happy to settle it over at [bets of bitcoin](

Rassah to be honest there were a few things you could have done to complete these transactions. The very first would have been some reliable form of communication, a phone number is infinitely more reliable when trying to schedule where and when to meet up with someone who doesn't know an area. You could have considered using skype on your phone for use when finding wifi. If we had talked I could have also suggested the university wifi which was a 5 minute walk from your hotel or we could have used my phone as an access point. The second was your window of opportunity, you only made yourself available for only a short period at the start of the weekend when most people have begun to venture out with friends. The last and most important mistake was when you suggested I trade directly with you outside of localbitcoins service. While I've only had good experiences with this service so far I use it for mine and the clients protection and feel they provide a useful value for the **small** transaction fee they charge. For this and the reasons noted above I decided to reject the transaction, too many red flags for me and ultimately too much hassle. While I appreciate your frustration, much of this could be avoided in your future transactions with a bit of planning. 
@_date: 2016-09-29 15:52:17
It's doubtful most people would agree with your definition of an exchange then. However, to get back to the original point that started this thread, freezing bitcoins is **very** possible and happens quite regularly.

So I've reverted back to 0.12.1 successfully. 
Leaving this note here for anyone else that might have a similar problem:
removed 0.13.0 with 
    apt-get remove bitcoin-qt
I grabbed the bitcoind, bitcoin-tx and bitcoin-qt deb packages listed in the [archive]( 
I then needed to use apt-get to install a lot of missing libboost-  packages (listed when first trying to dpkg -i the deb's)
I then reissued the dpkg -i command and they installed.
Lastly I used synaptic to lock this package to the 0.12.1 version so that it will not happen again with future updates.

What sort of specious argument is that? I've been involved in a lot of different communities running them well and running them not well comes down to treating people fairly, not brusquely.  
Just because they're not making a **huge** profit doesn't negate the fact that they profit from others work and bandwidth.

sort of correct, but substitute in "stream processor" everywhere you have "circuits" and you'll be closer to how it works.

With a FPGA/ASIC you can make one that is  **entirely** stream processors.

So far I've had three people contact me interested in transacting bitcoins. 2 out of 3 went smashingly easily, the third just never happened. YMMV but the tools the site provides, low fee they charge and easy ability to list buys and sells is worth it for me. I'm also **really** impressed with their escrow system which allows people to checkpoint trust at certain steps throughout the process. They even help anonymize the communication process.

To that end I've been hanging out in BTCPay's slack channel trying to get them to present their project more seriously. I fear it might be suffering from the usual FOSS project mentality and the community desperately needs another solution that isn't Bitpay while supporting lighting and segwit.

excellent point. However making it illegal would shift the focus of what bitcoin is. I think as a whole we **want** bitcoin to become a legitimate currency alternative. That's been the push from day one. More legitimacy means more users means more bitcoin use. If it becomes a quasi legal currency a lot of the uses for it drop away, and it most people's minds it becomes suspect. What bitcoin should aim for is digital cash, no more no less. How people choose to use their cash is their business.

If Valve is missing out on sales and their costs are essentially nothing (due to it being a digital product, infinitely replicable) them they don't actually care what you're paying. As long *as* you're paying. 
It's how things like Humble Indie bundle could exist. 
Also no one buying games on steam cares that they paid one price this week and now the equivalent  btc is worth more or less. We're not buying houses here we're buying entertainment. Many of us *use* bitcoin because it has the added benefit of supporting the network growth / adoption which providing additional benefits.

* He allows free downloads of his books directly in multiple formats. All under a [Creative Commons]( license. 
He's done this since 2003! I think it would be an amazing boon to get Cory to accept Bitcoin donations directly on his site.

hello, I'm "the guy from localbitcoins". So the legality of bitcoins has yet to be tested here in Iceland and for that reason IMMI is a bit wary of accepting them.

That  is a good example but not really where my criticism is levelled. It is my opinion that basic science R&amp;D and projects are **only** fundable through government sources as private business or interests aren't willing to make the investment on the timescales required for returns. For short one off events like disaster relief, sure private citizens and companies are able to mobilize cash in a way governments cannot. Perhaps we'll see a privately funded [LFTR]( in the near future which would be a big step in that directly. As is often the case however private ventures only step in after someone's done the initial heavy lifting of design or research (usually from public research institutions).

I don't believe we'll ever see it happening again. It was caused by [coinbase spamming the network]( from dust transactions, they and others are now using block batching and segwit and Bcash stopped pumping the price. Have you looked at the network congenstion graphs for the last few months?

I can't believe the incredibly naivete in some comments so far. It's pretty clear in my mind that there will be a conflict at some time in the future with authorities. It's also not impossible for them to shut down/disrupt the network through technical means. So the sensible thing to do would be to start preparing for that day. I'm not talking about the latest person that gets ripped off but something akin to the ITAR court cases back in the 90's regarding export of crypto.

@_date: 2018-03-29 18:30:58
no their main reason the cited was fees on because of the [network congestion](
The volatility they mention there only mattered because they used Bitpay as a provider and the price was slipping while completing purchases, again because of the network congestion.

while I don't disagree we'll hit congestion again at some point in the future, batching and segwit get us over the horizon where Lightning will be viable. Past that point we'll have sidechains such as mimble wimble which can alleviate.

I'd agree there's a "anti-company" bias with regards to users. However I think the caution is justified as once bitcoin attains actual value for companies, the social accountability of such entities is non-existant, and that bias can **is** justified. 
I've been involved in bitcoin since the beginning and it does worry me that original core bitcoiners have been migrating away, but the places they've been migrating too seem to be more sketchy than the remaining core acquaintances and backers. I've also never been swayed by the arguments for larger blocks from that contingent. Which prices full nodes outside of the client bases reach eventually.

While companies **may** have good motives and values behind their actions, because they are entities that are made up of groups of people they often can (and do) swap those values when needed to maintain profitability. This and the fact that most humans tend to anthropomorphize them are the single most dangerous qualities to them.

The form of the currency doesn't really matter, it's the assigning of value to an object and then ALSO making sure it's not spent by the time you'd like to redeem it. This is the crux of the problem, since someone has to CREATE the money with some pre-existing value there's a chance at that point for them (person, bitbills, printer company etc) from USING that value. You won't know about that till you rip the foil off the bitbill and try to use it.

He's someone from the original 90's crypto wars, he's worked on several crypto cash solutions that all failed because he tried to monetize them. From quotations of him it's clear he cares more about the idea being out there and being used than anything else. Plus no one's heard a peep from him in years on what he's been working on. Bitcoin's implementation came from somewhere "mature" since it popped on to the scene fully functional, in other words it's someone who knows what they're doing, which couldn't be more evident than the fact that the founder is a phantom. Normal projects don't have that much foresight. Also initial programmers don't produce projects like this in a bubble.

Just because they can suck it in doesn't mean they have the ability to store it all, there's a lot of realtime prefiltering thats going on. Storage and access to that storage has and always will be a big problem for large installations. I'm speaking from some experience here as I used to work on the storage arrays for one of the LHC's projects and there were 3 layers of filtering from the colliders before anything was even stored long term, it's just too much noisy data. You're half correct in your other diagnosis. They most likely look for suspicious traffic in general and then when a true investigation gets under way they use side channel, siezures, ssl mitm and trojans to bypass security defences. However the math of encryption is still sound and there's not much they're going to able to do about it. You're going to have to be a REALLY high value target for them to dedicate major resources to defeating well implemented crypto. We're talking on the order of spy vs spy at this point. Which jives with your last point pretty well.

But why by symmetry? You're assuming you the individual, have more autonomy than the state (made up of millions of individuals) and then taking that assumption and using it to justify equivalence in usage of violence, when the power dynamic is anything but. This is misconstrued at best, at worst outright ridiculous. Also you seem ready to escalate to violence in steps that aren't immediately apparent to me at least. The state escalates in structured mostly transparent manner (yes there are problems) it's usage of violence. Who determines if your usage is disproportionate or not? Are you just judge, jury and executioner then, because that just sounds like a despot to me.

Funnily enough **I** don't agree with everything we promote nowadays too! 
That's just the nature of movements unfortunately, they quickly attract ideas and people who have no place in the mainstream, like moths to a flame.

I mined (on an Atom cpu) back in 2010 so I have a pretty long view of Bitcoin history. We were popular for a bit but long shipping times to get here, VAT tax on imports and general Icelandic xenophobia slowed everything down a bit. Then the price started bouncing around which made large scale mining facilities a bit more risky. 
We have a lot of hydro power due to damming up glacier rivers here so some aluminum smelting happens, it's a bit controversial because of the pollution and environmental effects. 
AFAIK now, we're tapped out for excess electricity capacity without creating more dams, except for one or two places. If the price keeps rising perhaps we'll attract some more operations.

Well as it stands now, the Central bank here has already issued some preliminary statements about crypto currencies not always positive (because of the auroracoin scare). Iceland has also been under capital controls since 2008 so it may be the wrong time to broach the subject of it in Iceland until those are lifted (which might start later this year). 
In reality Bitcoin is quasi legal here, there have been small inroads with mining and auroracoin lobbying the Central Bank, and so far I've heard of no strong enforcement because, like many places the law is vague about how classify bitcoin in Iceland. 
My view is that the longer we wait here, the more receptive the country will be to Bitcoin and the farther along the technology will hopefully be.

As to your point other point, No. Iceland is a small and incredibly economically volatile country to randomly experiment with.

I'd disagree since this post is specific to running an updated client as well as any technical considerations that go along with the update.

This is very useful information! But in the case of developing solutions for customers the patents would belong to them or is it BS IP you agree to license to them for the product you are developing on their behalf? 
As Re: patent pledge (PP) I'd assume most FOSS would supercede any form of PP since most embody some form of copyleft ideas. Ultimately n(and historically) PP have proven to be as useful up until the point they're not. As in they're good marketing fodder until new management decides to change an organization and then 'poof' they're not worth the paper they're written on. I'd much prefer the much more  cleanly delineated line of FOSS licensing /proprietary.

way to miss the point. Let's try it again. The EFF has better things to do than accept a currency that may or may not face legal challenges in the future. Until such time the EFF is erring on the side of caution and not accepting them lest it be taken as a sign of endorsement. 


so everytime the secret service prosecutes someone you believe it's a conspiracy? My experience shows they're just luddite's and the EFF was formed to combat their roughshod understanding of technology and overbroad legislative agenda.

I can't believe you hyperactive fools can't find some better way to waste time.

A.) He IS the author of bitcoin and you've just outed him, painting a big red target for governments on the thing you claim to love. Observe how well manning / assange / snowden / zimmerman / ellsberg have been treated to see how welcome agitators of the status quo are treated. 
B.) He just happens to be a japanese person working on crypto systems of which there are a few and clearly enumerated fields including cryto-cash, anonymity and privacy. And you've pasted a big red target on his back ANYWAY. Bringing a lot of hype into some random persons life. 
Get a grip and use Occums Razor, Satoshi is anonymous because he WANTS to be anonymous. He planned to be anonymous and his pattern of behavior so far indicates he would have screwed up this royally in that planning. All you're doing is feeding bitcoin frenzy / conspiracy theories which move bitcoin closer to the "tinfoil" side of legitimacy.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the onus of what happened lies with you. You did not communicate your idea in a manner tailored to what they were willing to hear. When talking to your bosses you should have been giving them more information about the public press coverage, major websites and their sizes who accept bit coin and the fact that the DEA was investigating Silk Road. That is the type of environment where you have to push ideas that rely on societal credibility not just your say-so. Since it was such a negative reaction you could go full bore at this point and put together a REAL presentation including the ideas I mentioned above and some visits to mtgox, bitcoinwatch, blockchain. If you don't do it correctly though you'll get laughed out of the office again, probably for good.

This is some good reporting.

Thanks for the link, I'll just have to wait and see at this point. I'll update this thread if anything happens.

Your hyperbole makes you instantly distrustful. 
@_date: 2013-02-02 01:37:03
nope I can verify that we've received various amounts of bitcoin since we've begun accepting via Walletbit. All the donations show up very clearly and quickly. Ultimately I'd like to move to a subscription based model where users could delegate an annual rate (in fiat perhaps) and donate that amount per month. Our work here takes consistent effort and lobbying.

it certainly IS [illegal]( see Art. 153 and Art. 154 . They could however use a payment processor outside of Iceland and receive SEPA transfers inward. **Full disclosure** I used to work for these guys.

this is **gambling** not **investing** plain and simple. All of what you've described you've done involved no risk assesment or good judgement.

on taking a rational and analytical approach to returns of initial capital while the latter is based on poor understanding of statistics and math.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:08:54
I'd be interested in setting on of these up, what are upfront costs?
@_date: 2013-05-24 02:05:27
hey thanks for the info, especially that second link. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:30:16


Nope sorry, same reason I won't trust/use cryptocat. Browser based security programs don't address the flaws that a single point of coercion introduces. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:16:49
funny to see this, I just paid for mine manually (in bitcoin) after contacting them about this. I can post the email exchange if anyone is interested.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:34:08
Yes they did, I can dig up the relevant article if you'd like on mbl.is
@_date: 2013-11-01 05:00:13
resolved finally

oops I failed to mention I ordered and received a batch 2 avalon which I'm mining on. However I'm a huge believer in TANSTAFL.

Sure it is, bitcoin is a small and niche idea that has limited appeal to the present world at the momemt. The EFF is concerning itself with issues like comprehensive domestic eavesdropping. Laws that directly effect nearly every American citizen and even legislative drafts that happen abroad. The have a limited amount of resources to spend on any given issue. While Bitcoin could develop into a world changing alternative the wise choice for them is to make sure it can develop on it's own and then take on any legal challenges **when** they exist. 


I'm not touching this one because it only leads down a conspiracy spiral. Either you believe that they're doing good work or you don't. If you don't start your own Bitcoin lobbying group and accept donations directly.

way to take responsibility and perhaps apologize......NOPE engage 12 year old forum personality. loquacious is trying to teach you something about the type of speech you might be using OUTSIDE this thread, maybe to avoid offending others in the future. Way to miss the point.
@_date: 2013-02-01 11:37:12
It is confusing and I apologize for that, I've lodged a ticket once with walletbit over this. However if you go ahead and choose to donation, it merely generates an address to send to, you always still decide how much to send to that address.

news at 12, bingusdingus90 while claiming to be an anarchist has never done much research into anarchists stance on equal rights for women.
@_date: 2013-02-10 19:51:29
are you pool mining or is this standalone?
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:57:14
Was about to and realized I did already on Nov 3rd! I'd easily say I donate more to projects I support now that I can do so easily securely and impulsively with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:15:39
hmm excellent information thanks for the input. The true problem of course is that we can't have any one singular popular market and also that markets are a prime target for regulation because of the conversion from btc to fiat. We need an elegant solution to this problem.
@_date: 2013-01-12 13:39:15
We'll gladly accept bitcoin over at [IMMI]( I've found that even though there's not a lot to buy with bitcoin I can donate to all those places I've meant to over the years but didn't want to get spammed with crap afterwards. I've donated gladly to the internet Archive this year since it takes me seconds with bitcoin and I know it's a *real* anonymous donation.
