At the beginning we had 
    1 BTC,
    2.5 BTC,
    5 BTC,
    7 BTC,
    9 BTC and
    12 BTC. 
We changed the 1 BTC to 0.1 BTC so the users who were not sure if the service is safe could give it a try with risking only a small amount instead of the value for 1 BTC.

We decided to add only those amount to simplify the buying procedure and to keep the tracking of payment simple. 
In future we may add more, if everything goes smoothly.

For now we have enough Bitcoins stashed to run the service for couple months, in meanwhile we are looking for the best way to buy more coins, backed up by our investors.

Most of the payment methods are traceable and reversible, if you feel insecure you can go with Bank, which is always reversible.
