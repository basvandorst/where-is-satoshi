Anybody who still clings to the fallacy of unfettered privatization being beneficial and efficient isn’t well educated on the matter. Corporate interests *literally* control the vast majority of media and United States political representatives. The negative economic outcomes (among many other global negative externalities) we’re experiencing are a direct result of private, corporate interests buying out govt representatives and their relentless, private lobbying campaigns. 
Couple these factors with the reach of private mainstream media’s 24/7 propaganda blitzkrieg, and the dire situation facing Americans today becomes clearer. Concentrated private capital only cares about the profit incentive and increasing market share. It’s antithetical to individual economic freedom and quality of life for the working class - as we’re plainly seeing in today’s “western” societies. 
How much does the US government give away each year in corporate welfare? [250-300 billion annually]( And these gifts are allocated to the largest private entities on the planet. Hardly any tax base makes it to small businesses - which in aggregate is the core of american employment. 
The private capital that benefits from Corporate welfare turns around and crushes small business competitors, increases their market share strangleholds and pays employees less and less even as productivity rises. Or they use their unfair advantages to move to cheaper lands, exploit the native populous, pollute their lands and abuse their infrastructure - in the name of seeking greater profit. 
Privatization and deregulation do nothing but break down impediments to *extreme*capital concentration and wealth inequality. These factors in turn are always used to increase private power and industry monopolies. 
The corporate-created American construct of the “libertarian” ideology is pure delusion. Ron Paul is a naive shill who continues to regurgitate tired corporate-propaganda that has wormed its way into mainstream political discourse. It’s perpetuated to justify private power and put blame elsewhere. The perfect alibi for billionaire propaganda outlets aka western mainstream media. Please break free from the delusions and lies.

This guy has a decent following in MMA globally. He was an undefeated champion in a Japanese promotion and a champion in another large US promotion. Solid exposure in a realm (combat athletics) that doesn’t have much exposure to crypto.

How were so many lost?

The LibertyX app is just referring me to third party establishments who sell Bitcoin for cash.
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:23:15
Lol I appreciate you.
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:14:04
Interesting. It’s surprising how many were lost to me.
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:56:58
Appreciate the response.

Thank you so much this response. Makes me feel like I can do this fairly simply. I have no idea how the nano s works, yet. Hoping I can fill in the blanks via the instruction manual and the internet.

That seems more risky to me. How would I find these people? I live in a heavily populated metropolitan area so I’m sure there’d be some takers, just don’t know how link up with them. I also don’t know what I’m doing and don’t want to get took.

I bought in multiple times at 10.1k then less than two weeks later it crashed to the current 8-8.5k. I just bought more.
@_date: 2019-10-18 23:36:59
Just do all three. No brainahh.

Everyone needs to read Manufacturing Consent. 
A robust analysis of mainstream media content shows how truly biased every single outlet is. They are objectively propaganda vehicles.

Short-term price is interesting and unpredictable but when I bought into BTC I bought to hodl for a minimum of 10 years. 
I believe in the BTC system and think on a longer timeline it has the potential to become a wholly viable alternative to fiat. I hope to never cash out and participate in the BTC space only someday.
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:48:41
I bought in at 10k just 2 weeks ago. Loved my welcoming to the party watching it crash and losing 20% right off the bat.
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:41:32
I absolutely bought to hang onto. And I knew realistically that the BTC price can/could crash, languish, or skyrocket. Likely all three of I’m hodling. I’m just into the system because it’s a superior currency and it has value as an asset at the same time. Definitely hoping to stack more in the coming months.

Buying bitcoin wholly took me out of my element. But I pushed through.
I got a hardware wallet (nano x) and bought cash through liberty x. They made me send pictures of my ID and everything. I hated that too but pushed through. Also had to pay an 8% cash purchase fee, which set me back even more. Now I’m down 30% from where I bought including that 8% handicap I started with. 
Despite all the difficulties and a bit of bad luck, I’m cool with it. I bought BTC to be part of the revolution. And I’m ok with how it all transpired. I learned a lot and from when I bought. I had no idea if BTC would skyrocket, languish, or crash. Didn’t really matter, I just had to hold some BTC as a principal. It’s a system I believe in.

Thanks, this is interesting. Using approximations, 3.5% of the world adult population is 171 million people. 35 million BTC users in 2018 isn’t a bad start.
@_date: 2019-09-27 20:47:55
Thought there may have been some kind of workaround technical people could use to get an estimate.
3.5% of the worlds adult population is right around 171,000,000 people. I doubt it’s there yet but I don’t doubt it’ll reach that number (in terms of users) in the future.

If there are approximately 7,000,000,000 humans on earth currently and approximately 70% of them are humans aged 18 and over, that equates to 4,900,000,000. So 0.1% of that would only be 4,900,000 people. 
If you take the estimates posited here (no sources provided) there are between 75 million and 42 million wallets in existence currently. Average those figures and you get 58.5 million wallets currently. That equates to 1.194% of the world's adult population having a wallet. 
Someone did mention the variable of people having more than one crypto wallet. So that percentage could be considerably lower in terms of individual BTC users. But it's significantly more than 0.1%, even conservatively. Which is fucking neat.

Whoa, that’s really interesting about Japan. I had no idea BTC was so adopted there. A wealthy and advanced “market” like japan is a solid bedrock for the currency in itself.
The smaller dominos falling (sorry for using Cold War rhetoric) is crucial. I totally agree with that. As we start to see it happen elsewhere, it could raise awareness in other populations, and accelerate their adoption as well.
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:39:02
Yeah exactly how I feel. I don’t want weak ass censored fiat. I’ll take the best alternative, BTC. Push through!
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:19:10
I agree with everything you wrote. 
There is a ton of ambiguity in terms of “users” and what constitutes such. But I think sending and/or receiving BTC at least once annually is a good start. 
I’ve never heard any discussion on user numbers. Its not something that exists explicitly but it is quite interesting to see theoretical numbers laid out, for me at least. For the exact reasons you state. This system has *tremendous* potential for global adoption and the supply is just so damn finite, comparatively. It could (and probably will) create an incredible value for the currency.

I grabbed 3k worth at the low point today. It was amazing.
