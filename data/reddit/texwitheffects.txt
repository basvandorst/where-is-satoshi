so what happened in the episode?! I saw the word "spoilers" but no one has said what went on in the episode yet
@_date: 2019-07-24 22:28:45
Damn that was a good list )))

I just watch that show for that hot blonde lol

I bought some about 4 or 5 hours ago and it was fine, but I tried to access my wallet a couple of hours ago and I couldnt
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:55:51
Thanks for keeping up the fight coinbase ))
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:17:46
check out world coin index, they have all the currencies listed and if you click on a currency it will tell you what exchanges sell that currency 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:02:11
I love bitcoin, but bitcoin cannot conduct electricity and gold can. Gold by its self is worth something, and bitcoin is valuable because we believe in it... but by its self its worth nothing.
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:16:33
Why is anyone even using coinbase anymore?
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:26:29
There are other exchanges that you can use to buy and sell, that doesn’t report your activity to the government. It’s called cryptocurrency for a reason.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:27:20
Hollywood Florida, or Hollywood Oregon?

14000, there’s no way it will go higher lol
@_date: 2019-06-13 22:12:02
Well that’s not good, they will probably force KYC onto all types of accounts now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:41:23
we all should start figuring out ways to go around these situations, if they try to block us lets come together and out think them
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:36:59
don't get into hyips or icos, don't tell people what you get into because it will usually hurt them, don't trade in alt coins when the price of btc is skyrocketing, ive had all these things bite me in the ass, it may be different for others but it would of been just nice to just put money in every week and hold it
@_date: 2019-02-20 04:00:10
Omg all day it was like that with trading hahahha
@_date: 2019-04-07 05:52:57

@_date: 2018-02-20 22:37:29
So is it true that there is a new type of code that is allowing a faster cheaper transaction?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:24:52
You know how much money it cost me to transfer 1200 in bitcoin?! 300 bucks!!! Why the hell would I tell people to start using bitcoin? Not to mention bitcoin is killing off all the other cryptocurrencies along with itself. Bitcoin needs to figure its shit out or just quit.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:30:42
I really do appreciate all the input because I am still learning but I do think I have a decent grasp on the situation but also not fully. With my logic it seems like 10 miners will be able to process more transactions than 1 miner. Does anyone have any other ideas (other than segwit) on how we can make things flow a lot easier?
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:54:03
I don’t understand why every media outlet is constantly trying to demonize Russia. They really don’t want Russia to team up, work together, and become allies with other world powers.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:27:20
So if Russia gets big into mining, things will go downhill fast? Why??? It’s great Russia is stepping up and contributing to our movement.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:55:38
Lol that’s exactly what I was thinking.
@_date: 2017-10-17 08:08:04
sweet thanks man
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:26:11
lol I was totally gonna say that looks like Fraser.
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:36:19
College is such a scam. I wish I would of never went.
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:28:04
This can only happen in communist countries right?
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:16:43
Every time I see someone post something from this website it’s always talking shit about some cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:41:12
Yeah I hear Slush's pool is really good. Would you know of another good pool for backup?
@_date: 2017-10-17 08:44:23
Hey bro is it me or is the payout tab in the settings section non existent? Trying to set up my wallet address and i cant find where to put it?
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:04:56
When you buy things in bitcoin you are promoting the use of bitcoin. The business will notice this and become a mouthpiece for bitcoin and help promote it to the masses to continue to use it. If everyone was using it it would be extremely hard to stop the movement.
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:23:27
Do you have a website? How do I use your service?
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:34:47
Japan is fucking awesome! Keep up the great work guys! ))))
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:03:16
Yeah I stopped looking at that site.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:35:20
I am going to set my miner up this weekend. Can we please get a step by step instruction on how to do this? When you mean "node" does this mean "miner" also? Thanks, lets help each other! ))
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:23:40
Do you know if they have it for iOS?
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:09:38
Don’t you have bitcoin atms? We have them in America and they are pretty awesome
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:09:37
Give me an example of why it is a scam.
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:05:00
Actually WageCan was one of the first to offer a global solution to spend your bitcoins with a card. This was years ago. I know because I have one... thank you very much.
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:00:02
If you want change in your society, invent a solution... that’s what bitcoin is ))))

Did you even read the headline to this post!? 
They are lying about being the first company to make a crypto card! I don’t care if it’s their first card or not the fact is that they are already lying! It’s false advertisement! 
Oh and I’m not trying to promote WageCan because they aren’t in business anymore. This company is obviously crooked because for one, they aren’t the first and they are lying about that, and two, anyone who has been following crypto for longer than a year knows about that cryptocompare website where you can go into the wallets section in the cards area and see that there is a list of companies (not just WageCan) who have global paying cards that you can use your bitcoin to pay for things using one of their visa/MasterCard cards. So they obviously don’t know much about crypto because these cards are old news. They’ve been done before!
They aren’t the FIRST like the headline says! How is this so hard to understand???
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:02:17

@_date: 2019-05-14 14:33:24
Hey, bitcoin atms are instant. They are awesome and in my opinion one of the safest ways to get bitcoins without KYC. They usually charge 11% though but make sure you get a receipt and you should be able to get your coin within 30 minutes. CoinATMRadar is a great app to find a atm near you.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:15:57
Just because it is premined doesn’t mean it is a scam. If you said something like how bitcoin cash gave out a bunch of free bch then yeah I would agree, but no premined is not a scam. Try again. I’m happy with it because I just made 20% returns within the last 24 hours. Xrp will be the new global currency. It’s pretty obvious that this will be a great investment. I love btc and other privacy coins as well, but I want to make money.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:18:23
Damn that’s too bad ((
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:57:11
This is obviously an ad because there has been bitcoin cards that worked globally before this one. So this is not the first global crypto card ever.
@_date: 2019-05-25 04:20:34
You’re not the first though.
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:37:17
So basically you aren’t the first company to come out with a solution to spend your crypto using a visa/MasterCard. Pretty much you were lying so that you can sound more cutting edge. Fraud.
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:04:45

It was like near the airport. I stopped off there to get some gas for my rental before I turned it back in.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:50:01
Actually WageCan was one of the first. I know because I had one and it worked globally. So yeah that was one of the first global solutions and it happened years ago. There you go, you’re welcome.

Keep in mind that these atms will be different depending on who owns them. Some of them want you to identify who you are and that’s usually depending on how much you’re transacting in a given time. Some atms will only allow you to do so much and then it wants you to start putting in your information. The one that I go to just wants you to put in your phone number and a secret passcode, but I like to only do transactions that are 1-1000usd at a time.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:50:49
No WageCan was one of the first and it happened years ago.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:35:10
You obviously can’t read because I just gave you my counterargument in that I believe it is a great investment. I really don’t care if you don’t want to put money into xrp. Everyone has their place. If you want to make bad investment decisions and be broke that’s fine. I’m not gonna get all butthurt that not everyone is on my coin like you are. I honestly see nothing wrong with a company like ripple utilizing the xrp ledger to do a job that works and benefits everyone. The process works and I make money from it while at the same time I’m able to still stay anonymous. It’s a win win and I would be stupid to not put money in it.  So yeah... TRY AGAIN.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:37:57
So you can send the coins to wherever. What I usually do is I scan my binance Qr code and send the coins to my btc wallet on my binance exchange so that I can trade it for xrp. Then after my trade I send it to my wallet. All without KYC.
