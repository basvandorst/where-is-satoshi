First, Bitinstant was a shady exchange that shut down because it had some many complaints of taking users Bitcoins(almost 20,000 complaints) and was operating like a Ponzi scheme.
Second, law enforcement has, from the start, clearly indicated they are not targeting Bitcoin or Bitcoin users.  They are after criminals breaking old laws.
Charlie Shrem is a criminal.  He was directly participating in Silk Road drug transactions and he was directly/knowingly communicating with  Silk Road drug sellers / money launderers.
This is good for Bitcoin.  We need to cleanse our selves of all these shady individuals.  There are more of them, and they will be taken down as well.
Legitimate exchanges that follow AML and CYK requirements, but unknowingly provide transactions of questionable nature are not being targeted.  An exchange employee that actively and knowingly broke the law  is facing charges for his actions.

I suspect he's referring to limitations that *could* be put in place if Paypal is proven to have used anti-competitive business practices(Unfair Business Practices-Consumer Protection Act).
Perhaps a stretch, but there could be real consequences if it can be demonstrated that ebay/paypal have a pattern of  cancelling Bitcoin related transactions just because it in direct competition.

How ignorant must you be to not understand the difference between moderation and censorship.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:28:18
elaborate on "someone tried to pay in £1500"  Someone tried to deposit it, you tried to deposit it?  £1500 in cash?  or was it a £1500 check?  or a £1500 credit card transaction? or £1500 wire transaction?
Basically you made the mistake of allowing a transaction that could be seen as suspicious/risky go through your account.

No one said anything about stopping ASICs permanently.  And I do get it, I've been mining with ASICs since the first few days they were available.
The gpu power from the shitcoins will be key to securing the blockchain at the time of the switch.
As someone else said, it's almost like that's the accidental purpose of shitcoins, keeping a reserve of hashrate to secure the blockchain if needed.

Again, the key is "at a glance" which is all the time a moderator usually takes.
It's just the pattern of posting prior to your prolific posting about a year ago.  It's a total stretch I admit, but that's often what happens.
You very well may have been treated unfairly by a moderator, I'm not trying to make a case against that per se.  I'm more trying to give a picture of how easy it is for someone to feel like they've been censored, but really, that's not necessarily what happened.

@_date: 2017-03-18 08:52:24
but the root of this problem is mining centralization ... hell Antpool is even mining empty blocks.
Bitcoin was built on the back of the decentralized miners that came before Jihan and his cronies.  It's time to restore what was best about Bitcoin mining from the get go:
Anyone could mine coins.
Yeah, it won't last long, but what a breath of fresh air it would be.

Hahahaha ... I feel so bad now.  I was just too lazy to link for attribution.  My apologies.
And I think that a permanent ban wouldn't even be possible.  But I think the resulting reshuffling could be healthy in a lot of ways.
At the least we should be prepared with a running testnet.  Jihan's statements have revealed a level of self-destructive mining behavior that can only be attributed to immaturity or insecurity.
Couple that with nutjobs like Ver / McAfee / etc and we have an issue that must be addressed proactively.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:57:05
They didn't close the accounts for Bitcoin activity.  They closed the accounts because the activity looked shady or the activity was unprofitable for the bank.
If you are using an account for Bitcoin related activity, think of how an algorithm would view your activity.  Are you using the debit card frequently (that's where the bank earns fees) or are you doing a high volume of cash deposits / withdrawals (doesn't look like the activity of a normal personal or even business account these days).
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:08:00
Would you mind linking some of the posts that don't show up?  Not because I don't believe you, I'm curious to see if there might be other reasons.
As for moderation, I would ask you a question.
Would you agree that there is a fine line between moderating spam and what some might label as censorship?  Do you think it might be difficult for those who are actually in charge of that decision to draw that line without pissing off one group or another.
Read this candid post by one of the moderators.  Put yourself in his shoes.  Put yourself in Theymos' shoes.  It's really not an easy decision to make.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:11:45
here is just a small example of some of the spam that moderators have to quickly make a judgement call on.
Letting something like that through means that someone could lose money because they thought it might be legit since it's posted on If you've ever run a large system, you would totally understand this burden.  I have and it's an immense burden. 
It's unfortunate that many are ignorantly labeling it censorship, because that's not what it is.
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:34:59
maybe randomize was poor wording ... My thought process is this:

The accounts were shut down for a pattern of account activity that is not profitable for the bank.  I guarantee they didn't use the associated debit card for anything and that is one of the biggest red flag to identify an unwanted account.

It would not be vulnerable.  When I proposed putting a plan in place, it was precisely to address all these issues so that we are prepared.
The roll-out will insure that a small group of miners does not benefit.
We are currently addressing methods of rewarding miners that moved to segwit first, but that could change depending on consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:21:20
Early miners, especially GPU miners spent insane amounts of time configuring, fixing and tending to their GPU farms.  In comparison, ASIC miners just plugin in an ASIC, set it and forget it.
I leave my ASIC farm alone for months at a time.
My GPU farm was nothing but blood sweat and tears with long hours tending to it.
GPU miners are the heroes of Bitcoin, not the centralized ASIC farms we see today. By jeopardizing Bitcoin, BU is putting the mining proceeds that GPU miners earned and are now holding at risk.
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:02:57
Perhaps, but in those cases, it was done by individuals looking to break away from Bitcoin.  In this case it would be to protect the core principals of Bitcoin.

More importantly, stop using exchanges, that's your main problem.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:02:12
It's shortsighted to fuck those that set the foundation for Bitcoin and made ASIC mining possible.  More importantly, they are endangering the value of their own efforts.

yes, and this would re-inforce BUs categorization as an alt-coin.  The exchanges would label it as an alt-coin, and from a mining perspective it would be categorized as an alt-coin.

@_date: 2017-03-21 00:06:29
Don't forget that "censored" is a very strong word.  It's clear that BU wants that to be their rallying cry, and it's disgusting to be frank.
We've had some really nasty scammers hurt members of the community in very real ways.
And to be honest, many of those scammers are part of or associated with the BU movement.  It's still like the wild west here in the bitcoin community and the recent success of Bitcoin pricewise has only made it worse.

@_date: 2017-03-16 20:12:02
Then you're doing it wrong.  Banks have expectations for certain types of account activity with business accounts.  If you're not performing standard business type transactions that make them money, they will shut you down quickly.   If in addition to not performing regular business type activity regularly, you make mostly risky transactions, they will shut you down even faster.
Since you're going through accounts like water, it's clear you are making these types of transfers against new business accounts with no activity history... another red flag.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:26:20
But this isn't about greed.  Miners aren't acting individually by their own greed.  On one hand they are being manipulated by a criminal who will do anything that will spite the US government just because they kicked his scummy ass out.
On the other hand, they are being manipulated by the majority hardware manufacturer that is threatening to stop supplying them with hardware if they don't abide by his terms.
Note that most importantly, all of these manipulations are occuring outside of the the system Satoshi envisioned.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:39:14
I really agree.  As an early miner, I knew that mining was where the control would be down the road.  I think that just as Satoshi couldn't foresee the role of ASICs, he couldn't foresee the multiple abuses of power that miners could inflict on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:31:44
There is a problem though.  You negotiate with someone who has something you want.  BU has nothing we want.

Let's be frank then ... you have no clue about a £1500 transaction and you are faulting the bank for closing your account?
You can't be clueless about transactions to your banking account and not expect it to be viewed as suspicious.
It has nothing to do with Bitcoin and more with you opening an account with no understanding of how business accounts work.
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:38:31
It's clear you have a reading comprehension problem as well as having your head stuck up your ass.  I never said anything about everybody else.  Nor did I say anything about myself.
I said Roger Ver is the biggest piece of shit we've seen in the Bitcoin Community.  That's a well known fact to anyone that has been involved in Bitcoin since the beginning.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:00:00
I think the biggest advantage is putting the ASIC miners in check and crippling their hardware.  
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:28:12
As a miner, I can tell you that most miners don't keep up with this stuff on a timely basis.  Especially with ASICs.  It's a set it and forget it thing, so it's common to check out of the whole process for weeks at a time.  It will take time before all the miners weigh in.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:09:55

Then I don't think you truly understand what is motivating Jihan / Ver / Shrem / Voorhoos / McAfee.

They are a small group of truly incompetent players with truly destructive intentions.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:17:28
Being prepared was more the point of my post.  Actually, my feelings were that developers should hopefully already have everything in place.

It's far from absurd and any issues can easily be solved once the testnet is up and live.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:54:41
Anyone that is mining BU is mining an altcoin.  They have signaled their intent.  If they don't follow through with that intent, then this is all moot.
Miners that are on core are not a small group of miners.
To be clear, the goal is to avoid this.  No one wants to see any drastic changes that could hurt Bitcoin and its users.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:19:40
Not exactly the same place.  It would be a lot easier for other ASIC manufacturers to start from ZERO today.  Bitmain would loose their monopoly.

No, this community is experienced and educated.  There is a difference.
Moreover as much FUD is there is about it's not hard to imagine the mods have their work cut out for them today and it's plausible a mistake was made.  It's a pretty long post, so even misinterpretation is possible.  No need for tin foil hats here.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:53:00
lol ... I take it you're new here.  You can't just focus on short term gains.  Changes that might appear to hurt short term returns  could very well secure the success of bitcoin long term.
The money that is made from Bitcoin today is really only a fraction of the societal benefits that Bitcoin offers long term.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:06:36
It's time to out Roger Ver and his crony friends so the miners see who they're really getting in bed with.

Don't forget that this is the only developer that abused his position as a bitcoin developer and was corrupted by a liar pretending to be Satoshi.
He was removed because his poor judgement led to him being completely untrustworthy.
Now, if you see the scammer crap he is endorsing, it's obvious the developers made the right decision turning their back on him.

It looks like your comment is ghosted.  Ghosting is normally automated and from Reddit itself.
The most common cause of ghosting is voting/commenting on your own post/comment with an alternate account.  Under this scenario, your account would be ghosted automatically at a certain threshold regardless of what subreddit you are in and even if it is in multiple subreddits.
I'm not saying you did that, just giving an example scenario and showing how it would be automatically ghosted without moderator intervention.
Now, with that said, it's also possible a moderator muted you for a post that was questionable, but I kinda doubt that.  As a moderator, in a busy subreddit, it's not an easy tool to use.  That is, you can't just click on the username and a mute button appears.  If I'm working down a long thread of comments, I'd much rather just delete and move to the next spammy comment.
If a mod did mute you, I would have to add, that reviewing your account history at a glance, it does kinda look like someone trying to build up account history for a spam account.  It would be an easy mistake for a mod to make when they are just reviewing your account at a glance.
With all that said, just message a mod and ask if you've been muted.
Good luck :)

It doesn't matter if they're yours .. they're the only set circulating because there is no mass closing of accounts.
If you open a bank account and run suspicious transactions through it you're gonna get shut down.
You do understand that recipient and sender aren't the only data points that determine whether a transaction/account is suspicious don't you?
There are complex algorithms that analyze the transactions of an account and compare it to what is "normal" 
Like it or not, if your account doesn't match up with that ... or is unprofitable, your account will be shut down.
The typical bitcoin user's transactions to an exchange will fall into that category, not because the recipient is a bitcoin exchange, but because of the amounts and frequency compared to the previous account history.
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:37:57
Holy sh*t... Did Roger make it past the third grade?
To include a chart with a date range ending on March 27 to demonstrate a steep drop due to block size is both deceptive and just plain retarded.

You really should think before you post.  They should not use the same database.  Only a short-sighted retard would think they should share databases.
And if they are going to share the same data directory, the user should be asked if that is what they want.

Latency really comes into play when you look at the virtual "monopoly" on fast hard-wired internet connections.  
It would not be difficult for the major internet providers to block Bitcoin nodes just for their own self-interest because of excessive resource usage. 
Those of us who are familiar with running servers are familiar with the list of services that most hosts / colo companies block (minecraft / torrent / etc)
Then there's always the possibility of regulatory agencies ordering them to shut them down.
What if issues like this forced the network onto slower internet connection, both wired and wireless.

Nonetheless, you're 24 core xeon isn't really typical, even for tech savvy home users.
Additionally, in most cases, HDD, CPU, memory won't be the issue ... bandwidth cost / latency is.

They missed some important indicators of Roger Ver's true motivations, but I like how they touched on one of his major issues ... his ignorance and complete misunderstanding of how things work.
They really should include some background on Roger's major motivational factors.  
The biggest is probably his desire for revenge on the US government due to some perceived "conspiracy" against him, even though [he renounced his citizenship to avoid paying taxes](
Here's some info on his [criminal background] ( as well as his propensity for [seeking revenge] (
In the case of his criminal prosecution, Roger likes to pretend he was singled out, but no one else was storing 15-50lbs of explosives in a residential apartment and sending them through the US mail.
Very little of what comes out of Roger Ver's mouth is honest or based on facts, and most are based on his own motivations.  There is an endless list of Roger's "nutty as a fruitcake" ideas,:

wow, it's just right over you're head isn't it.
Bcash, came second, so they need to design for interaction with an existing data directory.
And actually you're wrong.  When I installed the Bcash client first, and then installed Bitcoin Core, it asked me where I wanted my datadir.  It seems like the Bcash wallet developers dropped that functionality.
Like I said, it's malware.  It fucks up existing software on your system  (possibly intentionally).

You're doing it wrong ... I regularly move 3-4 coins for $0.25 to  $0.75.  Set the appropriate fee for your transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:11:51
Don't be ignorant.  Nothing is free.  The value of the Bcash you hold came from value you lost in the BTC you hold.

I completely agree.  How can so many people not understand what a distributed peer to peer currency is.
It means that you store your bitcoins on devices that only you control.
The current state of bitcoin is no different than the current state of traditional banking ... it's driven by greed.

Keep this crap out of here ... Bitcoin finally got healthy after Bruce left and stopped trying to manipulate the outcome.
Bitcoin is 1000% better without Bruce.
We don't need criminals that prey on people when they are most vulnerable.

Not really ... the populations of economically developing countries are much more versed in mobile payment systems.  Look at m-pesa which is M-Paisa in India.

Bitcoins are to be spent ... not saved.  It's a payment system.
And specifically, a micropayment system.

I wouldn't bet on India either (or any country) ... my point is, there are so  many more people in the world that get what bitcoin is about.

Where does the mainstream media find these obtuse writers.
I mean seriously, did they even graduate high school?
How about this for a reason to accept Bitcoin:
Access to the millions of smart/savvy consumers that hold Bitcoins and want to spend them.
