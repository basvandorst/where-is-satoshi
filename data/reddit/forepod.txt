No one claimed the code should be 100% foolproof. An error was found, and now people want to know why an error like that came to be, so that they can avoid them in the future.
When a big airplane crashes people don't just go "Oh well, you can't expect it to work 100% of the time". No. An investigation is launched to determine what happened, and recommendations are made to avoid the same thing from happening in the future.

There's many things wrong with Windows. I'm certainly not saying you should switch.
My point was that being "Unix" is a very bad argument _for_ security nowadays.
It's downright irresponsible to claim that macs are "more secure" because they are Unix (the message I replied to) or simply stating that it is "obvious" (like you did) as this does not really agree with reality.
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:09:24


What makes you think that?
@_date: 2019-03-02 07:04:10


To be fair, that's not how it works in most parts of the world. You take out your card, touch the terminal and you are done.

Isn't Lightning still a beta/draft? Isn't it a bit irresponsible to recommend people to use it, when even the developers acknowledge it's still in the testing stage.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:16:34
Isn't it just as likely that it's due to being less ubiquitous, as you mentioned earlier?
I feel like "Unix is more secure than Windows" is a bit of a meme from 20 years ago. Certainly the Unix security model is completely outdated compared to what Windows/Linux/macOS currently have going on. Just being "Unix" brings very little to the table nowadays.
Or do you have _any_ concrete examples of how "Unix" is more secure than Windows?
Consider for example that macOS had [1064 CVEs]( filed in 2015-2018 while Windows 10 had [658 CVEs]( Not an entirely fair comparison, as there are other Windows versions in use too, but you get the point.
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:40:09
Compared to the dollar. That's pretty important to mention.

The Lightning network paper is _literally_ a draft version: 
Is there a non-draft, final, lightning network spec somewhere to be found? Meanwhile, there _is_ a final, non-draft Bitcoin protocol spec (does not mean that it can't be modified obviously).
_Nowhere_ on the page  is the word "beta" mentioned. There is _no_ mention anywhere that it is to be used for testing.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:33:05


You could just as well argue that because Windows has a larger market share than Linux or macOS that Windows is the most secure. I'm sure we can both agree that market share is not a valid argument.
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:12:12
Sure. But probably most of those projects are not used to secure significant amounts of money. At least I hope so.
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:11:41
Right. But the point is that banks allow it too. You can pay someone on your phone. You use about the same, or slightly less time than for bitcoin of your personal time. Sure, it would take until Monday to clear (assuming oldfashioned non-instant transfers), but it's not like you are unable to vacation during this time.
@_date: 2019-12-26 09:25:22
Then they should state so in the build instructions. Why do the build instructions result in something that not even the developer thinks is good enough that they would use it?
@_date: 2019-04-30 10:04:27
I'm confused. If you have internet access to pay with Bitcoin you have internet access to make a bank transfer. Or do you have some offline bitcoin payment system set up? What software do you use for that? How do you get the transaction on the chain?
@_date: 2019-04-19 06:44:08
I'm confused why some people are confused by some other people buying time with money. Time is way more limited than money, so it seems like a sensible deal to me.
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:08:58
But surely the first thing you check when you open an account is that you can move money away from it? Would you open an account on a Bitcoin exchange without checking if you can transfer away from it? I'm really honestly astounded that someone would open an account in such a bank. For sure it is not the norm in banking, just like one-way exchanges are not the norm in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-18 08:36:48
Despite the name, hardware wallets aren't actually wallets. They just hold some private keys and sign stuff with them. You can use these keys with a a bitcoin wallet, or something totally unrelated, like SSH or PGP. The hardware wallet itself has no idea about the state of the blockchain or what your balance is.
@_date: 2019-04-21 07:19:42
None of them really affect the price though.
@_date: 2019-04-19 11:41:58
Depends entirely on what you are learning, how useful it is, what else you could be doing.

Right. I can make a bank payment during the weekend. Just like I can make a bitcoin payment during the weekend. There is zero reason to go to the bank on monday. If I make a bank payment in the weekend, the receiver will have the money on Monday. A bank payment satisfies all the requirements:
1. Pay at home during the weekend
2. Contractor has the money on monday
It turns out that OP has a really, really shitty bank. There are better banks. Just like how I can find a shitty bitcoin wallet or exchange.

I don't understand the point of using a secure, decentralized protocol if you are just going to throw it all away by using some unverifyable software.
If we don't care about trustlessness, why not just use existing, more efficient, centralized solutions?

Where exactly are Finns going for medical tourism, if we don't count vanity plastic surgery in Estonia which I'm 100% fine with being expensive in Finland.
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:04:37
But according to the story monday was entirely acceptable, so this wasn't actually a problem.
@_date: 2019-04-30 16:05:56
Do they though? As I said elsewhere I can transfer tens of thousands of euros for free. That's actually cheaper than bitcoin. Is banking really that bad in the US, and what could the reason for it be, as it seems to be technologically entirely possible to have a pleasant banking experience.
@_date: 2019-04-30 10:21:11
The problem is not banks. The problem is banks where you live. 20 USD??? I can pay literally tens of thousands of euros for free. But then again I live in a socialist hell hole that robs people from their god-given right to get abused like that by people with more money.

What makes you think a native retailer would get a better deal on a brand ftom the same company?
@_date: 2019-05-01 20:35:52
Why though? What do you win by tying a currency to a basket containing bitcoin, vs a basket that does not cobtain bitcoin? You get all the negatives of BTC without any of the positives.

I've had a lot of trouble with Kraken.
Absolutely clueless support who apparently have no experience using the product (got four different incorrect answers from three different people on how to do X when I was bounced around support, until it turned out that feature had been removed), don't know the company they work for (support claimed they have no european presence), support site is broken (suggest mailing their support email address, which just gives an automatic reply to try the support site), and the new verification is broken (won't accept documents actual banks and Bitstamp happily accepted, refuse to delete now useless documents), etc. I could go on. It's a real mess.
And let's not forget when the exchange went down for days a while ago.
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:26:44
Right. But why _Bitcoin_? You made the argument that you should have a basket that includes _bitcoin_.So why should a country tie their currency to bitcoin, rather than e.g. gold?
Also, Scotland is not a small country in South Africa, and holding something does not require tying your currency to it.
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:32:17
Seriously open a book on basic economics, take a look at actual real-world examples, or even just read what I wrote.
1. Do you disagree that if your currency A increases in value compared to another currency B, then things priced in A become more expensive for people earning in B, unless there is a corredponding price reduction on products priced in A?
2. Do you disagree that this will lead to less people who earn in B to buy your products priced in A, because the prices are less competetive?
3. Do you disagree that things priced in B become cheaper for people earning in A because of the favourable exchange rate?
4. Do you disagree that cheaper prices abroad will lead to increased imports from the cheaper countries?
5. Do you disagree that reduced export and increased import is bad for the economy?
Exactly which of this basic points of economy do you disagree with?
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:40:34
And how does that result in a rise to power? I'm sure you have a good source showing that statistically countries with very low inflation, or even deflation like Bitcoin, rise to power over countries with a moderate inflation? I'm also curious about just theoretical thinking you have behind that, even if you don't have actual examples.
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:56:15
So you did not even read what I wrote? You point out a price reduction is possible even though I literally wrote that. Literally.
Maybe the real reason you don't want to read books is that reading is difficult? If you're not even going to try, I really don't see the point in discussing.

My transfer has been stuck for 3 days now. A bank transfer is both cheaper and faster for me.

It really depends on how the purchase was done.
Did Kraken aquire Cavirtex by buying the majority of stocks? In that case Kraken is responsible. But then why did you not sell your stocks to Kraken, rather than stay in the minority, and why did the stock price not rise on the news that it's being purchased (i.e. why would owners not exploit the fact that Kraken has signaled their interest in buying, and their power to stop said buying).
Did Kraken make some deal with Cavirtex to somehow directly acquire the company? Cavirtex has no authority to sign itself over against the wishes of shareholders, so in that case the previous Cavirtex oweners are responsible.

For example,
1. Exchange was down for *a week* due to a botched software upgrade, with apparently no possibility of doing a rollback to the previous version. Tells you something about their operations team.
2. They had for example listed Bitcoin SV, and didn't have the guts to decide themselves whether it's something they believe has merit or not. They removed it after letting the users vote on it. Tells you something about their policies and vision of cryptocurrencies.
3. Their support gave me incorrect information several times in a row, each person explaining that the previous one had accidentally given me wrong information, and then proceeding to give me more incorrect information. Information that they could have easily checked by opening the website themselves. Tells you something about their support team.
4. This probably doesn't apply to you, but they have some (IMHO) pretty loose interpretation of the GDPR, which means that they refuse to delete some documents they no longer have any business keeping.  Tells you something about their legal team.
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:54:42
Yeah, that's not how exports work. Unless you plan to force different domestic and export prices, which is tricky to say the least.
I suggest you read up on the topic. Take a look at what happened to Switzerland in 2015 for example.

Kraken is a US company and supports US bank transfers in USD. There are reasons to avoid Kraken, but being in the US probavly isn't one of them (full disclosure: I am not in the US)

It still requires trust in the ability to repay.
@_date: 2019-05-03 05:23:07
For instance, if you reduce the price of productA by X% in order to keep exports, you now earn X% less $currency. This means you now have to pay X% less salary to your employees, cancelling out the gain in their import power.
As I said, just read up a bit on it. It's basic economics and there are many real-world examples.
You can avoid these issues by simply investing in Bitcoin rather than tying your currency to it. You have not yet presented a single argument for tying it, rather than investing.
In your example you'd also need to keep track of the exchange rate between cars and $currency, as you've essentially created a parallel currency. What exactly would be priced in this parallel currency? Prices of products, but also salaries? Taxes?
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:40:30
Right, as you say Bitcoin is likely to go up. Which makes it a terrible national currency as it kills exports. So, why not just simply buy Bitcoin and reap the benefits, instead of tying it to a national currency and tank the economy? Countries go to great lengths to keep their currency from increasing in value.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:27:36
How are the shares worthless? If anything, the price should have gone up after Kraken announced they are buying them. Why didn't you sell your shares to Kraken?
@_date: 2019-05-21 10:22:02
How would it work on a centralized exchange then? Transferring bitcoin takes hours, so is often not an option to just transfer on demand when you want to sell or buy, especially with the wild fluctuations Bitcoin experiences. And there anyway is no nice UX for securing funds that need to be available for limit orders.

Lending inherently requires trust.
