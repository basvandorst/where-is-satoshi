It’s not as if we don’t know where there are. There’s an address that was sent 3700 bitcoins this morning. The question is who controls the private key. 
It’s hard to profit from this because those coins are tainted. If someone tries to cash out it won’t be hard to figure out who.

It’s not wrong but you got lucky, you had no way of knowing whether it was going to go from 18 to 13 or 18 to 22

When you buy on Coinbase, you lock in your exchange rate. So don't worry about how long it takes to transfer.

If transactions aren't getting confirmed, then there isn't any arbitrage to even out the price across exchanges.

No, I’m arguing on the basis of the time value of money.  By the time the price goes up 1000x, a dollar will be worth significantly less than it is today. 
If you want to consider 50k rich, go ahead. But getting there with a $50 investment? Not happening any time soon. 
All this craziness over the past year - and the price has gone up 10x or so. 1000x from here? In a few years? Fucking give me a break. 
If you honestly think bitcoin is going up 1000x in a few years, you’re delusional. 
I would like nothing more than to be wrong.

It's not a closed system. It's powered by the sun.

It’s assumed he’s gone so if someone is able to move that money it means they’ve found a serious hole.

A tenth of a bitcoin is more than 12.5 times more than OP is talking about. 
Put another way, if someone is expecting to get rich (say, 100K USD) on 8 mBTC, then that means 1 BTC=12mm USD, and I can afford a mansion in the Hamptons.

It's 135 GB at this point and can grow up to ~50 GB/year.

Even if you saw a 1000x multiplier in your lifetime on your $50 investment, that's only $50K USD, which doesn't make you rich in 2017, let alone 2057. Don't you understand the time value of money?
Invest $20,000, and maybe you will be rich one day.
