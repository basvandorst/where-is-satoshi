Regardless of the debate of bitcoin scaling... the position bitcoin currently holds is a good example of technology getting closer to the singularity. I have concluded that bitcoin and blockchain technology are years ahead of their time. We are witnessing human intellect trying to keep up with technological capabilities. 
This may be a blessing in disguise in that we, as a society, can learn and adjust to the new technology before it becomes a social norm.

Stay strong young man! I appreciate your message. You are 100% right... it is only money! Money comes and goes but it's important we stay true to our values no matter what our balances show. I wish you and your family the best! Take care.

I used to work next door to a wells Fargo. Wells Fargo employees would come in to my work regularly. One time they're entire system was down for a little over a day. I asked an employee what happens in that scenerio. He informed me that when that happens "customers" are only allowed to withdraw $1500 maximum. Even if their account balance exceeds $1500. Super sketch. Also, their employees were ALWAYS trying to get myself and Co workers to set up an account. They would literally bend over backwards to create an account for us.

I have done research. Being that this is brand new tech it's obvious to me the ones who know most are those either developing something themselves, are comfortable reviewing source code, or have spent an extranneous amount of time reviewing the people behind such projects.
If this felt like too much work to you all you had to do was scroll past.
I genuinely hope your day is better now that you let some steam off.

In the meantime, find ways to make the money to pay the difference when it's back.

And if it wasn't full people wouldn't be profiting so much. Improvements to the network will come. Patience.

Wait for things to settle. Set up an account in the meantime so your source of payment can clear while all this btc/bch madness is going on.

Did you see the selling price per btc? Saw an ATM selling for $7000+/btc when price was barely about $6000/btc that day.
