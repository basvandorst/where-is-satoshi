So I am completely new to this, but wanted to buy some Bitcoin. I signed up with Coinbase (an article I googled told me it was the best way) and when I bought, it was refunded and said my bank (Wells Fargo) denied the transaction. Am I doing something wrong?

yeah, the FOMO is real. And I figured it was a "banks aren't letting this happen, thing." I think I'm just going to do the transfer and live with the delay. Thanks!

You have my attention. How is it better?

And it'll likely be that way until they can figure out a way to safeguard themselves on that front.

bluh. that sucks, huh? thanks anyway.

I signed up for Robinhood and am on the waitlist, but have no idea how long that will be for.

ATM is bad?
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:14:41
it seems so :-/
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:30:41
starting to get that feeling...
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:28:04
I'll google that. I had no idea it could be done through ATM.

I had used my debit. My checking account shows the amount debited, then immediately refunded.

haha... 19-year-old me would love your play on my username. 
And that makes sense. I've been reading around about bitcoin and others for a few weeks, feeling pretty confident about putting in a little money that I don't need, just to try it out. Now I'm finding myself researching methods of purchasing bitcoin, which I neglected until realizing it's not as easy as I thought to purchase bitcoin.
