It's illogical to imprison people for keeping the money they earn.  Don't let them intimidate you.

Absolutely.  Unfortunately - as you know - to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, probably the most convenient way is to perform a bank transfer.  Bank accounts are already controlled by governments, so moving money between fiat and bitcoin will always cause trouble for that reason.  I've thought about opening an exchange with very lax trading rules such as not requiring users to verify there identity, but have not done so, because I strongly suspect that the service's bank account would simply be shut down.  Trading for cash is much much harder to do, since it requires finding a geographically local buyer/seller - or mailing cash, which then has a 2+ day travel time.
Directly paying for products and services in crypto is what we really need to achieve.  Lighting network needs to be fully implemented, to make that doable.  Unlike direct Bitcoin development which is "centralized-decentralized" if you will, in which one person writing an application can benefit many many people at once - such as implementing the Lightning network - directly paying for products and services in crypto would be a truly decentralized effort, meaning every single individual business needs to go out of their way to enable payments in crypto, before it becomes a viable currency that cannot be controlled, not just an investment vehicle obtained by bank transfers, which of course can be controlled.

2FA is a fad, I just store my passwords in an encrypted text file in 3 separate locations, each location also storing 2/3 of the decryption key.  Using any 2 you can recover my passwords etc etc, but with only 1 you cannot do so.

Woohoo, finally transaction fees are going to be low enough for Bitcoin to be useful for small purchases again!

Actually I don't do that, but that's what I WOULD do if I wanted added security.  SMS is a proprietary technology belonging to telecom companies, and they have made little to zero effort to make it possible to script and automate the system.  I wouldn't be caught dead whipping out a cell phone every time I want to log in to a website.  OTOH, I can easily write a script that SSH's into 2 remote computers each with my passwords and 2/3 of the decryption key, combine the keys together, and access a decrypted password.  What I ACTUALLY do is keep all of my (long and unique) passwords inside a secret spreadsheet on my hard drive.  It's highly unlikely ~~the Borg will be able to break it~~that anybody will actually hack into my PC and find it.  If I were afraid that there was a rootkit logging my keystrokes or clipboard contents, I would grab a browser extension that lets me log in without ever having my password reach my clipboard.  If I were worried that my browser had a vulnerability, I would have to browse using curl I guess.

Why are there so many trades of those bitcoins
And altcoins against fiat?
Bitcoins are virtual, and worth next to nothing
And have no backing at all
So we've been told, and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it, the bitcoin correction
The traders, the investors, and me
Thank you, Jim Hensen!

LocalBitcoins, or some other relatively off-the-grid bank-transfer-to-crypto exchange.

For just $50 you might want to choose a coin other than BTC - I would suggest LTC if you're buying from coinbase.  BTC transaction fees are roughly $10 right now, so if you bought $50 worth, the transaction fee would be around 20% of your total amount if you ever wanted to move your coins to a different wallet.

At what exchange rate?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:25:44
Bitcoin has had multiple, multiple previous bubbles shaped just like this one.  Price goes up 4-8x and then drops 2-4x.  End result is that price goes up by a relatively small factor, and furthermore IF you short at the right time you can make some additional profit.  I think we're very fortunate to have Bitcoin's price charts to look at - I see it as a very accurate, pure example of what a new security should look like as it gains acceptance over time.

They wouldn't be able to simply siphon off part of your income.  If they linked untaxed bitcoin income with your person, they would have to apply rubber hose cryptanalysis to get at any of it.
