Nice one, the biggest gaming breakthrough has recently made by quark [see here]( it's devs have worked with the biggest games ever and are adding quark for in-game payments and even made a quark power gauntlet to use in game. This should be supported by every Crypto enthusiast and the best part is this game is not only for pc but also ps4 and xbox which brings new users to Crypto.

While we are nitpicking


Need to change clothes, do hair, make up (if female), put on shoes, go to car/bus/train/taxi/metro (costs money), get to wu, get in the row, get money and go back, while i'm chilling at home without all the hassle and i receive my money with bitcoin.
You don't have to sign up on the exchange at all to buy bitcoin, i can buy pretty much instantly from  without any id, and who sais the receiver wants to cash out the bitcoin to usd? This is send bitcoin and receive bitcoin that's it.

Gems has pretty solid encryption, at least way better than whatsapp. It's pro Bitcoin after all, if you still worry about your privacy than i wouldn't know, but i know 90% of social messaging users aren't this paranoid about it. They all use whatsapp and other apps with poor encryption and these regular peeps is what Bitcoin is missing, thats what Gems is trying to get them in. btw you don't have to be a female to use gems lool

How are you going to handle the exchange rate btc to rial, rial is one of the most worthless currencies, 1 bitcoin is 10 million rial. I think people will shit their pants seeing the exchange rate, or you need change it to bits, 1 bits would be 10 rial

You don't know anything about the shah, misinformed as fuck. He loved his country just like reza shah, in the beginning he had no choice to chose sides with the west, and why not eventually you need some allies but later on he pretty much made it harder for the west by raising oil prices, iran was becoming a superpower, if you see his interviews with western journalist you will see what i mean. he was removed and khomeine a fucking hindoe was installed by the west which pretty much fucked iran..forever. 1 dollar was 7 roman during shah, 1 dollar now is 3000 roman, buff said. iranians regret for supporting the revolution so much now

They use gems because off chain = no fees
See here 
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:59:59


But there is no coins left to be mined after the mining period, what happens then? Should fees keep the miners active?

Bitcoin itself not, but it's fans want to
@_date: 2014-05-19 10:10:55


The guy that invents Bitcoin you would think he is also capable of making it fully anonymous, i think if he really wanted to he could have done it even if it would take longer. Also i'm sure you will be hearing these features that make it fully anonymous in the media in a negative way if it catches up.

You can't compare shoes with money lol, the power of money is much more than shoes except if you are a sprinter.

What a fcking mess these couple years have been for bitcoin lol
@_date: 2014-05-19 10:06:12
But they are not portable, for instance with Bitcoin you can go through borders with billions and nobody would notice, but on the other hand it's not fully anonymous so that compensates it
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:38:09
Did you see the link? Because of no fees and obviously creating a new token that they can reward the users without actually using the btc that they need for development makes sense to me. Also they are targeting especially females and teenagers too, since these target groups are a huge part of a successful social messaging app which we are missing these groups in Bitcoin, thats why the layout of the app to attract females in the Bitcoin/Gems ecosystem aswell. You can use Bitcoin too so why not best of both. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:32:43
Yeah if you butthurt haters would support it it would get much more crypto adoption, but you are mad it's not Bitcoin who did it. 
Also premining means mining it before it has released which i proved you wrong, having faster block halving is different than a premine, just saying

ffffffffffffffffffffffuck yeahhhhh!!! Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:31:53
So since the us and eu are corrupt aswell we shouldn't download apps which are made by devs located in the us or eu, sounds legit
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:14:34
It's not pre mined and here is the hard proof to shut down these false accusations once and for all 


O so you are saying getting Crypto outside these complicated features which the average joe doesn't understand anyway and spreading it amongst tons of regular people and gamers through a huge game won't impact people? You underestimate how huge the gaming industry is. Actually if you all would stand behind this project many many gamers and companies around the world would get familiar with Crypto, i bet if it was Bitcoin you all would have loved it. Big Deez Production is standing behind Crypto (quark) and now you guys. If you don't know who these guys are see [this link]( 
I thought Crypto was more about spreading the word and getting people to adopt to it? All these extra developments are going to fast and these developers actually forget to reach the guys outside the Crypto world which Quark trying to do through this game.

Correction, you only need ID verification of u want to withdraw daily up to 25k in fiat and 50k in crypto. Without id verification you can withdraw up to daily 5k in crypto and 2.5k in fiat, but you need address verification for this and personal info. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 11:26:14

I said Bitcoin related, since you can use Bitcoin in the app. If they win than i'll be happy for them, we all know banks are getting involved so rather a company that is in favor of Bitcoin than one with malicious intentions.

Actually from what i've seen their goal is to attract more mainstream social media users than only bitcoiners. Achieving this having an app with only a Bitcoin wallet is not enough. As is true for most software, the developers are at liberty to make changes at any given time if needed.

Well let's take a look at the scoreboard. In 2018 we saw 6 high profile PoW attacks against top 150 rank coins. This count is limited to security and doesn't even include the hashrate wars and other problems like costliness and environmental damage. On the other hand, PoS has had no mainnet attacks that anyone can point me to.

Tezos historical core protocol upgrade without hard fork, through its governance mechanism. Where stake holders have a say (80% participated) instead of handful of people.

Come on people don't be jealouse because another coin is doing well. You all want to make money don't you. You all try to fuck each other over in btc-e trollbox 24/7 to pump a coin to make money don't you. You don't care about others losing money. This is the financial markets. Quark is where the profit will be. BTC is too damn expensive which give us two options, LTC and QRK you know why? Because Quark made it mainstream and got mentioned by Keiser. You know when he mentioned it i bought alot. You know why? because the guy made Bitcoin where it is now, he made Litecoin where it is now. Now don't tell me he can't get Quark to $5 atleast. Besides the more i look into Quark the more i realise how more legit it is than some of you selfish numnuts who have your own agenda make it to be. I like it's community also, they are very supportive and have an altruistic attitude and are doing everything to make this coin succeed. So don't be a douchebag to go over there and trying to fuck things up. They are doing there best so cut the crap you all are overreacting like hell. The coin will succeed and if you ask me the coin is way undervalued.

This thread is BS and FUD. OP is saying BTC is going back to where is was before China joined. NOT GONNA HAPPEN. BTC has evolved alot since then and more countries/companies have joined.

Quarks distribution is better than Peercoin, same as Namecoin and almost as good as Litecoin. This after only 5 months. You BTC hooligans need to research first instead of being a parrot repeating others just for saving your own investment. Quark is build on a different economical model not just a copy and not pre mined.
