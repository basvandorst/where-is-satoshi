Bitcoin ecosystems, hyperbitcoinisation, Bitcoin-colonialism. Move over banks, we're taking your wires. We're coming for your accounts.

I couldn't detest the man more. However Roger Ver, is known as "Bitcoin Jesus".

Exactly. Afterwards we raised our flags and flew them proud. Jk

Moved all my holdings in Bitfinex to CEX.io
They have a higher BTC valuation anyway.

People including myself have posted many times in r/vzla and other forums about how Bitcoin can help with the inflation problem. Time after time being met with down votes and comments like:  "don't talk to us about your ponzi scheme bs" type comments. Now Venezuela has two of their own coins. The Petroleum backed by the Maduro government and Bolicoin

The shit he's causing to land owners in Hawaii is enough to warrant asshole status. He's already got enough money but he's bullying them out. 
Haven't natives suffered enough rape from American colonialism.

My brother in law refused to sign up on binance when he found spelling errors on their front page.

Bitcoin. Litcoin. I need to gitcoin.

I've got like 100,000 bs
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:19:12
Yes. You have to spend around $4k on a laptop that would be fast enough.
It would be more profitable to put the $4000 into buying BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:48:00
About 88,000:1
Realistically to get the money changed by a trustworthy person it's probably like 80k:1 though.

Sent it to an email address. After a certain amount of time it goes unclaimed and returns back to the sender.

FTFY "Now, where is my fucking money." 
Banks do this for amounts as small as 10k too.

Contrary to popular belief. You can not pull large sums of cash out of a bank. You can't even close your account with advance notice if you have a lot of money in savings.
This has happened to me at multiple institutions. If I've requested cash for deposits on cars. Banks are just required to have a certain float of cash at all times and will sometimes limit you from withdrawaling amounts beyond $5000.

Personally I can't speak to moving a billion dollars of my own money via wire. However I can say that I have experience sending wire transfers in Canada which banks used to charge $40.00, but now I believe they charge $60.00.
My comment above was speaking more to unknown limits placed on your money that's in a financial institution. Particularly in forms of cash. Which is weird because it's your money. Frankly most people are unaware of how difficult they make it for you to access and move your money. Bitcoin removes that oversight and its cheaper in most cases.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:14:34
Maybe I've misread this but could you elaborate?
That  next to free transfer you're talking about is severely limited.

There's a massive thread of disinformation being spread on r/futureology today. I particularly liked this guided post saying that Bitcoin is inefficient at at one point transactions were the equivalent to burning tons of coal in electricity costs.

They have all these things. It's not readily available due to the government.
@_date: 2018-11-17 21:17:02
What äre you asking?
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:46:43
It's very hard to get USD there. Venezuela only uses national banks and there's limits on the transactions you can do while the money in your account devalues everyday.

That's the way she tells the story to fit her current narrative.

The Bolivar on the black market exchange is trading at 7100:1.
