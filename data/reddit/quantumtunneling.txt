I worked at Microsoft for 7 years and while Google is probably better in this regard, Microsoft suffered because a lot of important decisions were made by middle managers who had given up coding long ago.

While its certainly possible that Mike is mistaken, its also possible that he's entirely correct. I've worked at companies like Google (Microsoft etc) and I saw this shit all the time.

Lol what? No, that quote is 100% inline with everything I said, and 100% contrary to your previous comments detailing your flawed ideas of what the debt ceiling is. Once again, the debt ceiling is about paying OBLIGATIONS ALREADY INCURRED, which you have already admitted to, so be a man, drop your pride, and admit you were wrong.
The correct solution to this problem is *actual* fiscal conservatism, not buying a bunch of shit and then refusing to pay for it, which the republicans have been complicit in. Refusing to raise the debt ceiling had nothing to do with wanting to decrease spending, and everything to do with trying to win a political battle. If the republicans actually wanted to decrease spending they wouldn't have agreed to buy all the shit we've already bought, including the ridiculous amount we spend on defense. 
Defaulting on our debt would throw the country+world into an economic disaster. That's your solution? If you actually support decreasing the debt then you should support cutting spending, including those republican sacred cows like defense spending
Furthermore, I don't give a shit about Obama or the liberals. I'm not a sheep, and I don't let political parties tell me what my opinions should be.

No, that is flat out wrong and a complete misunderstanding of the debt ceiling. Congress had ALREADY VOTED ON AND APPROVED the spending that required the debt ceiling to be raised.
From [Wikipedia](


Paying obligations already incurred... You have been mislead for political gain. Surprise surprise. 
And yes, the system is *actually* that stupid. We have limits on paying our bills, but not incurring them.

It's a bullshit image designed to defend the idiotic position of conservatives who didn't want to raise the debt limit. Let me tell you why *not* raising the debt limit is idiotic:
Lets say that the family gets together and collectively decides that they want to buy a brand new boat! Great, so you go pick up your boat that day and have a blast on the lake. 
When the first bill comes in the mail a month later, you suddenly decide that you are going to refuse to pay the bill because you've already got a mortgage, car payments, and little johnny's college tuition, and you don't want to add more debt! 
The solution to this problem is not refusing to pay the bill, ITS NOT BUYING THE BLOODY BOAT IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
Raising the debt limit isn't saying we're going to spend more money. Raising the debt limit is saying we're going to pay the bills for the things we've already bought. 
Now you know why that entire debacle was a giant political stunt. Decreasing spending is a defensible position, but voting to spend money buying a bunch of shit and then refusing to pay for it is what this poster is trying to tell you to do.

Its not an assumption, its how markets work.  If the growth rate of bitcoin is lower than expected, then its price will go down, despite demand going up.  Your assumption that an increase in demand implies an increase in price is dead wrong.  If the increase in demand is known and expected, like is is with bitcoin, then this becomes built into the price.  You're acting like a newbie investor who is all confused when the price of their favorite stock plummets despite the company having record sales.  Their logic is that record sales will mean an increase in price right?  Wrong. Record sales were expected to be greater than they actually were, so the price dropped.  Its exactly the same with bitcoin.

If the gov waits too long to outlaw btc, it will be too late as they will face a massive public outlash, think SOPA times 100.  If influential companies like amazon, Facebook, and google etc get behind bitcoin, they will have massive lobbying power backed by popular consensus.

My understanding is that Quantum Computers if fully realized would destroy the cryptographic securities that bitcoin, and the entire internet for that matter, rely upon.  Certain problems, like deducing the private key from the public key are mathematically supremely 'hard' for standard computers.  The same would not be true for Quantum Computers.

You need to understand that, unlike everybody in this subreddit, the vast majority of the people in gov and elsewhere believe bitcoin to be a scam and a fad not worthy of their attention.  By the time they realize what is going on it will probably be too late to stop it.

The idea that the value of bitcoin will continue to rise over time is false, because that is not how markets work.  The current price of bitcoin has future growth expectations built into it.  Its price rises when people think its future growth is not represented by the current price.  This means that the price will only continue to rise if the market consistently lowballs its future growth.  And it has already been demonstrated that this is not the case.  Finite supply currencies is what the US worked with up until 1971, so saying its doomed to fail is absurd.

Litecoin is like fools gold, as it wad designed so hackers could put their botnets to good use.
