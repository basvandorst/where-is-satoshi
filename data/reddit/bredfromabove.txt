But PoS doesn't need as much energy and it solves the problem PoW solves as well just more efficient. IMHO btc is a huge waste of energy.

Well this might be true for europe and maybe the US (not under Trump though) but I guess this won't be valid for Asia or Africa as well

Some Questions for you guys:
Consider this:


But each branch can grow with the same speed in parallel. To me the probability looks huge that branches can get really long. Why can one branch become bigger than another? They all get updated in a 10 minute interval. Or is is due to the way the blocks get propagated from one node to others?
 Block Creation Time: 


The last part is hard to understand. Can someone ELI5 what "a way of measuring how much consensus" means.

How can unconfirmed transactions be rolled back? How do I do this?
What happens if I set the fee super low and just hope the transaction gets dropped? How can the shop owner be aware? Can he find out by somehow checking the transaction and then reject it?

Noob here with a noobish question:
If I send money to an address my wallet will broadcast this transaction to some nodes which in turn do the same and so on. So these nodes then pick some transactions from a pool including mine and start mining. So it is possible that 2 miners work on the same transaction at the same time right? So in the end there might be 2 blocks which contain the same transaction. What mechanism prevents them to append both blocks to the chain?

But how to send it again with my wallet if I just spent it? I mean do I have to use a hacked or special wallet? Doesn't the wallet keep track? 
Also, if the one with the higher fee gets picked, the other one gets dropped because this transaction is already in the chain ledger somewhere right?
