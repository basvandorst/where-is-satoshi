Misleading. Owning fiat currency pays interest. Bitcoin pays no interest.

The system you are describing existed in the 1800s we had presistent deflation, boom and bust economics, and frequent bank failures. 
The economy will continue the way it has. Your opinions don’t matter either.
You also have no reason to say that bitcoin will work rather than gold. I actually think bitcoin is fine in a portfolio but no more than a 1% position is needed. 
It’s in a bear market btw and will probably fall 50-90% in the next 12 months

Can you tell me why we moved off the gold standard? And why the standard of living has improved so much since that happened?

LOL we would have been in the great depression in 2008 if this was true.

You didn’t address my money creation point about the banking system. 
If I run a bank and take in a deposit, I make money by lending that deposit out. The depositor still has the money and so does the borrower. As long as banks exist, money can be created even bitcoin. 
In response to bitcoin being a store of value, it is extremely volatile. I can buy a portfolio that has higher returns, lower vol and inflation protection than bitcoin. It’s called ray dalio all weather.
If I want to save some money with inflation protection I can buy some tips.

Well inflation is quite stable and predictable in all of the major reserve currencies.
And the real buying power of bitcoin is not stable at all. It’s not even liquid.
Also, the economy does not work well when depositors cannot lend money through borrowers through the banking system without a guarantee. That would require very high interest rates and destroy the global economy lol.

And bitcoin as a percentage of bitcoin is irrelevant. If I owned 1% of the worlds dirt it’s worthless even if no more dirt will be created.
What gives a currency value it’s ability to pay for things and more importantly its ability to pay off debt and taxes. 
By that metric the US dollar is superior and it’s more stable.
You also didn’t address my point that gold and commodities have inflation protection and lower risk than bitcoin.

Lol that's what they said about japan. Their currency is doing fine.

So even under the gold or bitcoin standard there would be inflation. That is because savers need banks to deposit cash, and banks need to lend to make money. That creates currency. 
The problem pre 1970 and pre1930s was that in a good economy, this leads to a cycle where confidence leads to safety and lower interest rates which will cause a boom that over extends the economy. In the bust, as banks stop lending and people get fired, this leads to deflation, which is an increase in interest rate on debt essentially. 
To stop the self reinforcing cycles, we gave the government control over printing money. 
Is there a risk of inflation? Of course it is almost guaranteed. But commodities and gold or even bitcoin are a good enough protection. They only need to be a small part of the portfolio because stocks and bonds outperform stores of value over time.

LOL the United states is always creditworthy. They can print money.  If you want a hedge against inflation, why not gold?

You could have said the same thing about the tech bubble in 2000. Didn't help the people who lost everything.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:56:25
I can almost guarantee you it's going to 6k. From a technical perspective, new lows are abysmal.

Fiat doesn't have value because people think it has value. It has value because there's trillions of dollars in debt and tax liabilities that have to be paid in U.S dollars. You have to pay your mortgage in dollars, if not, the bank takes the house. Same goes for property tax. Because of this embedded demand backed by the power of the U.S government, the dollar has real value to a lot of people.

Proud of you, man. Your life is going to be amazing now that you don't have rent to worry about. Hope btc crashes so you can buy back in :)

Yes, but who is to say that bitcoin will be the currency that is on top? Why wouldn't the government or a bank create a blockchain based fiat currency? Fiat currencies have natural demand due to financial and tax liabilities. Cryptocurrencies do not. Furthermore, deflationary currencies don't work because they encourage hoarding and speculation rather than a naturally inflationary currency like the dollar which is stable and encourages commerce. There are problems with our monetary system, but a diversified portfolio (equities/gold/bonds/potentially volatility instruments) is a better investment than a cryptocurrency in my opinion. There's also a good reason that money is not backed by gold.

Not true at all, if there is a 1% chance of success, bitcoin has to go to 800k to be profitable, call it a million due to interest. That would make bitcoin worth about 15 trillion dollars. With that amount of money I could own Apple, Facebook, Google, Bank of America, Exon Mobil,Microsoft, Visa, and Coca Cola, and all of the land in Manhattan. I'd also have 10 trillion in walking around money. I'd take that over an online currency that can be banned or competed away.
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:37:02
Yes, because companies have value, while bitcoin's limited value at present could fade away.

Bitcoin and transactions that are difficult to track are a big driver of the opioid epidemic. It would be much harder to traffic in fentanyl without cryptocurrency.
