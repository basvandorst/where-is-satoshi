Well yeah. I once talked to someone who buys and sells euros for profit.

It's Satoshi himself.

I'm really disappointed by the rudeness and scum that Bitcoiners are. You're not really donating because you want to help anyone, you're doing it to raise the value of Bitcoin and increase the size of your wallets. Bitcoin is failing anyway; all you're giving these people is money that fades away over time. Just give up, get on with your lives, and forget all about this failed idea.

Take the sun, for example. It rose yesterday, but I'm not holding out on it rising again. I'm gonna invest in nuclear power for my bunker, just in case.

You can redeem your US dollars for military? BRB, converting money to USD so I can redeem me some military.

That doesn't seem like something productive. "Someone's invested in bitcoin? Quick, let's get rid of them!".
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:16:28
I downvoted you because you complained about downvotes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:39:32
I imagine that Satoshi is just sitting there, really confused as to why people are sending him minuscule amounts of bitcoin.

No. He quit, and blamed it on some random person. That makes him a dick. Giving away free money doesn't make him a dick. He quit, and blamed it on some random person. That makes him a dick.

I'm gonna wait for the price to crash, beg for bitcoins when they're worthless, and hope they increase in value again.

I'm assuming the transaction in it is to Satoshi. I have no idea how to read blockchain.info though.

Only take the one that says "Private" please.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:38:26
Nah, from the messages attached the them it just looks like some people like the idea of "a satoshi for Satoshi".
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:44:57
Person A: "Oh no, this press release says that China is completely banning Bitcoin. This means that I should sell my Bitcoins for a lower price so that they still get sold."
Person B: "Other people are selling their Bitcoins for a lower price. I should too, so that my Bitcoins still get sold."
Person C: "Wow, the average price of Bitcoin has suddenly dropped."
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:13:05

I can buy more with the BTC, so wealth is still gained.

You don't suck. Bitcoinbillionaire is just kind of a dick.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:18:25
I like your thinking.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:20:10
How do I do that? I have RES 4.2.

I'm Satoshi!

It was good, and then it went into all that "expect us" bullcrap.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:48:38
SabiWabi did nothing wrong. SabiWabi made a joke, and Bitcoinbillionaire fucked it all up in response to the joke.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:53:37
[I have you covered](
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:29:22
I ever so slightly detect that it's possible that you may be inclined to not buy very much bitcoin, possibly.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:10:45
At first I felt a little bit bad about you leaving, but then I realized you tried to turn us all against SabiWabi for making a joke, then overreacted and left because of that. 
Good riddance.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

When people spend it less, it's value will go down, so spending will increase.

Kind of tongue in cheek, but if the price does crash, I'll google "Bitcoin faucet" like **the motherfucking wind**.
