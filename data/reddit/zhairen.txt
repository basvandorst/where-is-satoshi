Well lucky you. Us normal folks spend $5-$20 pretty regularly and don't have more than $5k even to throw around. For us it kills the usefulness of bitcoin.

I offer you the abstract of the original paper by "Satoshi Nakamoto"


payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
It was ambitious. I'll admit, I believe in alternative cryptocurrencies 1000x more than bitcoin, but the original idea behind it was smart and potentially very useful.

What, me? Hell I'm a mod of so nothing. I'm a hard skeptic of bitcoin and don't think its current value has anything to do with its true value (inb4 hard downvotes on this comment). 
The original intent however is noble and valuable. The tech behind bitcoin will very likely become part of the overall monetary network once a coin becomes well developed enough. Right now bitcoin is a speculative asset without a doubt though. There isn't much there, but it could very well increase its value many times over thanks to the mania.

The path not changing in the next 30-40 years is a hell of an assumption.

Sure we don't want to get there, but there's no reason to assume A) the deficit won't decrease B) The economy will stagnate for a long time and C) our population will decrease like it has in Japan, so I don't get why you "don't see any other way it can work out".

Why? Japan is doing just fine with 2.5 times the debt load, and they don't even have the benefit of nearly 2.5 centuries of perfect credit.
