The operational question here being, "why bother with Coinbase in the first place?"  I have an account with them, abandoned them altogether because:
1. They took forever to credit my account, after having a valid credit card, other banking information already in
1. They raised the KYC bar to a point that they are more intrusive and annoying than most FIs
1. LocalBitcoins has not disappointed me, their reputation system has worked so far for me, and otherwise the hassle of making a deposit or meeting someone in person is much lower than the hassle of dealing with Coinbase
If I wanted an on-line wallet that could freeze my funds at any time and came up with all kinds of stupid reasons (real or imagined) to slow or stop my transactions, I'd just stick to PayPal.  At least they are accepted in way more places and they have a lower asshole quotient than Coinbase.

Except that the entrance to the Cerulean Tower isn't on the street level.  There are multiple entrances from various streets, not one unique to the tower, and so on -- hard to describe it if you haven't been there.
Business Insider has a couple of photos and a short piece about it:
I've stayed at the hotel there a couple of times and the multiple entrances make for fun times.  Anyway -- MtGox moving there reduces their public exposure unless enough people come around to protest on all entrances.  Someone also mentioned a virtual office...  it's a game.

That photo appears to be in Japantown, East Mall, top floor.  Great place for noodles but I don't believe it's a Ramen Underground.  I can't remember the name right now, though.
I go to Takara Restaurant, around the corner, at least once a week for sushi.  The lamps, etc. all are in the Japantown East Mall (formerly Miyako Building), atop the Daiso store.
Cool if they're accepting Bitcoin.

FYI - if they moved to the Cerulean Tower in Shibuya -- that means they now have security.  The tower houses the Google offices, a hotel, etc. and staging a protest there is awkward, to say the least.  The entrance lobby to the offices is not on the ground floor, and there's only a small promenade that leads into anonymous rotating doors into the tower.
Good luck with the protest!  I'd join you if I was in Tokyo, out of pure principle.

Helping my father with a similar set up.
He is a citizen of country A, his accounts (and permanent residence) are in Switzerland.  Coinbase will not open an account for him because his passport and accounts all have to be in the same country.
It looks like they operate in the same mode as PayPal.  Rather than having the regulators come look into their affairs, they have more draconian KYC rules and a higher verification bar.  As a result, they make people go through way more hoops.
I'm advising others (here and on Twitter) to just avoid Coinbase altogether unless they're interested in doing business only in the US, with US accounts, and so on.

By the way:  this is annoying because Coinbase has no business re-verifying an already verified banking account, with a valid IBAN and related information.  If the bank is happy with their client's verification, so should Coinbase since they are interacting with one of the most reputable banks in the world.  After all, Coinbase is NOT an actual financial institution but a broker at best.

Congratulations,  !
Do you know if O'Reilly will put it in early access/review?  I'd be happy to review it and write it up for InfoQ.

It's still down, 2340 UTC.

TL;DR for my previous post:  if I wanted to avoid attention and make it difficult for someone to identify my place of business, I'd move it to Cerulean Tower in Tokyo. :)
