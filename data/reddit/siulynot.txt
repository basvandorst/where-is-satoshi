From conversations with teams of different coins that have not been listed in bigger exchanges the prices range from $25000 in small volume exchanges, to over $250k on b8gger volume exchanges. Binance being the most expensive at around $500k.

Her comments about not seeing any bubbles right now reminds me of november 2013 when people said there was no bubble in Bitcoin. 
S&amp;P Just brokedown the trendline of a ending diagonal that has been forming since october 2014. We are already in the next global collapse IMO.
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:31:55
Alts have been freeing up space from btc chain since ever... yet, no one here considered that revolutionary.
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:43:55
That is what basically every other crypto in history has done to btc, many of them in decentralized way with no corporate cartels.... but i guess im out of the loop on this one since this will be celebrated anyway by the blockstream fans. It basically giving up you real btc for a corporate, centralized, regulated watered down copy... that even try to position itself as better than ETH lol
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:53:18
Yet everyone is celebrating it... that is the part that concerns me
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:25:10
Yeah. It went to shit, it doesnt eliminate the fact that it made the first btc 2 way peg using gateways. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:32:52
No its not, its just a company that made a btc product as their first offering and are expecting to cater other altcoin projects too to do the same as for btc. That is my point, that having the blockstream trademark somehow make people think that is btc certified... which is not. In reality this is just a crappy centralize service, even EOS has better structure in that sense, and that is a far fetch for me.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:40:18
This is not a sidechain.
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:10:48
Has blockstream ever looked at dPOW and the solutions it could bring even for liquid? 
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:41:22
Oh, so you are calling signed block merge mine chain a sidechain of bitcoin... wow... such new invention.
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:55:11
Merge mining doesnt make it a sidechain. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:27:02
Yeah. Bcash is a sidechain built on the bitcoin network by that definition then...
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:15:59
So locking up some "old btc" into this gateway altcoin somehow is building on top of btc? Yeah.  Right 
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:28:09
If this was a project from anyone else other than blockstream it would have been trashed here. That hypocrisy is what disturbs me.  
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:00:09
"Secured by the bitcoin network" is false marketing.
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:55:37
Yet. Nothing innovative.
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:07:14
The fact that a cartel made a pact to peg them, doesnt make a difference in the fact that its actually another altcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:29:38
It seems to be the contrary. Given the post im commenting in.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:39:22
This is the most blatant misleading marketing i have seen.
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:53:48
And the stability of prices across exchanges is being parasites? Great logic you got there 
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:31:42
dPOW baby... read about it ... ;)
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:29:09
Im answering to this.


@_date: 2018-10-11 08:49:05
No its not... it has come even to the point where they are blaming arbitragers of high txfees, i mean... it gets ridiculous how fast they get to antagonize almost everyone that actually uses btc.
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:12:02
Im not the one celebrating a centralized cartelized product just because it came from X corporation. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:50:58
If that is the logic then, what have been most altcoins been doing?
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:00:39
Tokenized btc has been done before and it haa never had anything to do with building *on top* of btc. If this is called building on top of btc then most of the altcoin platforms have already done this years ago and no one celebrated here. That is why i say this cognitive dissonance since it come from blockstream everyone assumes its something btc exclusive. Which is not.
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:14:00
These guys just invented this federated thing to fit their intentions. Sidechain are either tokens or run time forks. Merge mining doesnt make up for sidechain. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:51:00
I understand them very damn well, the only reason this can be pegged is because of the blockstream/exchanges cartel. In itself it has no value at all. You need to trust that exchanges will uphold the btc peg. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:09:18
"Confidential transactions" between "federated trusted functionaries"... lol... please dont make me laugh. 2 way peg? Sure. That i believe... it has been done by NXT and many other platforms since 2013. Doesnt make it "secured by bitcoin network".
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:45:03
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:12:12
Lol, do you know what a sidechain is or are you repeating the misleading marketing like sheep. How is the sidechain ledger being archived and where within the btc network it is being stored and verified?
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:49:09
So its wrong to use bitcoin?? I dont get it.
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:46:52
"Liquid is an innovative sidechain built on the Bitcoin network"
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:30:08
So you are saying that all altcoins can be called sidechains??? Is liquid a run-time fork? How is liquid secured? How is it not just a gateway like there was in the NXT chain?
Can you please elaborate on what makes this a sidechain?
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:43:18
This is no different from the BTC-E coupon codes you could use to move money from BTC-E to MTGOX back in the day.
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:14:52
Are you sure? Seems to me you are more a fan than anything else.
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:41:28
This only keeps showing how blindsided you are thinking that liquid is somehow btc 
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:04:30
Yeah, like liquid.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:29:08
At least they accept they are a lemon.
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:01:46
No its not. Where withing the bitcoin blockchain is the ledger of this chain being stored and verified?
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:12:09
So using bitcoin's hash rate to secure and federate other blockchains is bullshit? Hmm... wonder where i read bullshit like that today? Oh. But this other bullshit is centralized among blockstream and big exchanges.... so much better i guess. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:30:28
Yeah, first step, right.... lol. Its such a blatant mislead 
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:49:30
Because its using the blockstream trademark to market something that is not different of what other altcoins have done but disguised as "bitcoin officially approved"
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:47:52
Proof me that im wrong please. What innovative tech this liquid thing brings?
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:50:01
Did you read the article? It actually lets you know who the federation is formed by... its formed by exchanges. The exchanges are the ones who will enforce the peg.
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:21:11
Its a chain pegged to btc by a excha ge cartel. Not so different from USDT 
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:46:14
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:44:27
Its not my intent to offend anyone, but when im taken out of context just for the sake of making me look wrong i get pissed. 
If you take a look at the structural approach, even EOS has a less centralization than liquid. Liquid is basically a corporate cartel, convince me otherwise.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:08:29
It started as a dream then slowly but surely it became just a shittu centralized project that is calling itself revolutionary. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:52:27
Its not buil ON the bitcoin network. Its a merge mined altcoin that is sponsored by blockstream... blockstream built is not "built on bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:05:02
This is not building on top of btc, this is a corporate service around btc. Btc code is not changed in the slightest by liquid.
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:06:09
100% backed by real bitcoins?? Whut
... liquid is liquid, using liquid as a gateway for btc is not backing liquid 100% by btc.
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:58:18
Look at gateways from NXT chain... it has been done years ago.
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:14:52
Nothing that has not been done before and rejected by this community. But this time its blockstream, no one can argue or even doubt them right? Its sich a pity.
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:17:50
Im just astonished by the double standards regarding celebrating a watered down, centralized and cartelized service just because it comes from blockstream.
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:21:37
What makes it "backed by bitcoin" is the exchanges in the liquid cartel, not anything else.
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:40:57
Im not saying eos is better than btc you dumbass. Im saying that even EOS looks like a better alternative to liquid.
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:48:24
Proof, please.
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:30:51
Oh, so a run time fork is not a sidechain but a merge mined shitcoin is??? Please, make up your mind, you are confused.
@_date: 2018-10-11 10:06:06
You are in defending a centralized corporate service that is misleading people into thinking ita some how legit btc
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:06:08
Look above this thread, someone call them "parasites"... i dont know if you understand the extent of the stupidity of this issue. But anyway, im for arbitragers to have a faster service, no doubt. 
I just dont like how this is being marketed as something that will change everything or whatever shill its being called. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:56:41
You said that btc fees rise was because traders where arbitraging btc hence using them and that was wrong... so using btc is wrong?
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:51:00
Its a coupon code marketed with all the blockchain lingo to mislead people. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:34:17
How is btc getting and update from liquid?
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:23:22
No its not... its backed by btc as long as the exchanges in the cartel accord to it. You still need to trust the cartel (federated trusted functionaries).
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:03:58
Lol, wtf. Trades in centralized exchanges are not done on chain. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:31:25
Its a "federate sidechain"... not a sidechain. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:15:50
Exactly, liquid either then.
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:55:03
Who made an insane claim? Did you ever used btc-coupon codes? 
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:09:30
What if liquid makes a partnership?
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:06:20
I dont have any problem with this if they market it as what it is... an arbitrage coupon code between exchanges. Not a "network secured by bitcoin".

 i understant your point and i support it, but there is a very real posibility that when governments understan the menace that bitcoin can be for state owned currencies they will do everything they can to crackdown on it. Thats when legal definitions come in, and i think the community should be thinking about that too.
 there was nothing on the link you posted. I am publishing here because i know that spanish speaking users use it too.

We are trying to make a community in Puerto Rico. For now, I think there is no much people into bitcoins but i think that in a near future it will be getting some attention. We are thinking of making a service that would help people buy bitcoins using their local banks. I have high hopes.
About the cartels buying bitcoins, i dont know if that would be the target, remember that big transaction, no matter where they are made, are traceable. Big cartels would have a capital margin to big to lounder in bitcoins. But i think that, for example, Puerto Rico is in a big crisis right now, and maybe people would begin to trade in bitcoins just to evade all the hasle of leading with the colonial government that rules us. 
@_date: 2012-06-03 12:52:15
Or maybe you can just ignore the post and let the spanish readers appreciate it.
@_date: 2012-02-08 13:54:43
I understand. For the moment i will post the articles in both subreddits so that i can get both the exposure and the expansion of the spanish speaking bitcoin community.
