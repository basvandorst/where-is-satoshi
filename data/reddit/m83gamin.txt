Hey I am a saudi studying in the US, do you know a good reliable exchange like Coinbase that works in Saudi? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:46:31
Awesome. Thank you very much for taking the time and breaking it down for me. much appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:19:48
I covered the fees and I feel like the biggest baller, made Coinbase some money out of then air
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:29:40
Lol, you don't have to, I am a student I don't have a job, I dont have an ITIN or an SSN. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:35:04
so i'll still have to use bitcoin gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:20:50
ive been trying to. they're asking for a social security number and I don't have one, I just live in the US. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:41:12
and how would coinbase gdax know how much u have on ur Ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:27:22
no unfortunately I don't have that either 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:30:32
nice it won't be nearly as bad as coinbase, and the transactions are instant? in coinbase it takes 9 days lol

u guys are missing the point, youre turning this into a political debate basically every middle east country/ middle eastern citizen doesnt have access to btc, theres no reason to act high horse and turn this into a political thing. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:37:59
How did they send it if u choose to buy im curious 
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:42:09
Where did u get this info from
@_date: 2018-08-16 12:13:16
lol they dont give a fuck about btc. dont make it a political thing. u must be canadian lol
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:46:40
No, im actually making money i get 1% back as credit and sell it for 3-4% more here in saudi arabia, i just need a cheap website to buy from cheaper than 4%
@_date: 2019-02-21 12:38:54
Lol, wtf. The house of saud couldnt care less what happens to crypto. Saudi and Uae central banks are starting their own altcoin for ease of transaction between the 2 countries. And if we agree arguably that theres censorship, theres an invention called VPN
@_date: 2019-02-21 05:42:29
im from saudi, and ive never heard or read anything about crypto being illegal. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 05:42:07
its illegal in  Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Pakistan, Qatar, Republic of Macedonia, Saudi Arabia, Vanuatu, and Vietnam. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:55:03
