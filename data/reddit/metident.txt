And in what way does sending such transactions aid in an attempt "to chase the funds which were allegedly taken"?
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:59:44
Eh? From my recollection of Ron Paul's statements on these controversial issues, it seems he merely advocates that such regulation should fall within the state government's authority rather than the federal government's.

What's "regular" about them? They all seem like random advertising and charity-beggar spam to me. Some months the wallets received 5+ of these dust transactions, while most months they received none.
All those last recorded dust transactions occurred on the 6th because they were all sent from the same wallet, which happened to send exactly 0.00777 BTC to dozens of different rich wallets (all with over ~9k BTC).
My guess is that the sender is just trying to broadcast their wallet address to a bunch of rich bitcoiners, in the hope that one of them might generously or accidentally send them back a big sum. (777 for good luck?)
Also, there were new transactions sent to those wallets just now.

...Not to mention the coincidental erasure of all past tweets from MtGox's Twitter account, resigning of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles from the Bitcoin Foundation, halting of trading on MtGox on the day predicted by the "unsubstantiated document", deletion of all the html source code of the MtGox.com webpage and no service to any of its sub-pages, acquisition of the gox.com domain name as proposed in the document, release of a joint statement signed by several major players in the bitcoin sphere alleging that private discussions with MtGox have confirmed MtGox's grim situation, and I'm probably forgetting a few more things here. [Edit: Oh right, of course, there's yet no statement from MtGox about any of this.]
How irrationally optimistic does one need to be in order to dismiss all of this as "unsubstantiated", and claim that it "in all likelihood could be a forgery"? (Do you know what "in all likelihood" means?)

If the reddit account and the twitter account are posting the exact same information, then what does it matter who owns the two accounts? They both post links to  where all the two-bit-idiot updates are first broadcast.

If OP resides in the U.S., then they're almost certainly not eligible to buy/trade bitcoin with national currencies on Kraken at this time. (Except for residents of a few smaller U.S. states.)
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:00:34
I also wondered about this. But _if_ the sender is irrational enough about it to pick a lucky number (777) to send, then perhaps they're also irrational enough to think that their odds would somehow be improved if they put in a larger sum, as if they were treating this spam game like buying lottery tickets. At 0.00777 BTC it's still only ~5-10 USD per send, and in their mind the potential reward may be ~10k+ BTC.
I presume that many, if not most, of the people sending bitcoin beggar spam are in fact far from penniless.

Haha, what you write is ridiculous. If you want to be clearly and directly understood, why don't you drop the all the dancing around with cowering Randian code language? Who exactly are your nebulous "gangsters"? Why not say what you mean plainly, directly calling out the government tax boogieman and the banksters as you mean to do?


Involuntary exchange is coerced exchange, which is essentially the definition of extortion. You give no examples of involuntary exchanges that are enabled by the preexisting currency systems, but would be disabled by a cryptocoin currency system. The examples you do give are merely extortion, against which (as you admit) bitcoin provides no new protection:


This is perfectly analogous to the crytolocker extortion situation. The cryptolocker example proves that bitcoin doesn't protect one at all in situations such as this: you either pay the bill or suffer damage to your property or person. If you believe a tax bill is also violent extortion, then why would you believe bitcoin will change the outcome at all?

Except that bitcoin doesn't accomplish this at all.
Before the bitcoin economy, the state-imposed regulations are primarily enforced by sanctions backed by force. In the bitcoin economy, the state-imposed regulations are primarily enforced by sanctions backed by force.

To OP: Your only hope is to get human help from CampBX customer support.
Lesson for all: This is why it is so important that every time you enable Google Authenticator 2-Factor login on some account you should record the "shared secret" code that they give alongside the QR code during 2-Factor setup (unless they give you limited-use emergency backup codes that you can record instead).
This randomized alphanumeric shared secret code is the same seed that is encoded in the QR code, so you can use this shared secret code to manually setup the same Google Authenticator 2-Factor link again in the future (on the same or another device), which is particularly important if your primary 2-factor device ever is lost or gets wiped. Of course, you should take care to store this backup code in a secure, hidden, secret location since anyone who finds it and knows what it's for could punch it into their phone's Google Authenticator app and now have the 2FA access codes for your account (though even then they would still need to figure out which website, username and password that particular 2FA access is associated with).
Any time you deactivate and then reactivate your account's 2FA setting, it will generate a new random shared secret code and use it to seed the new 2FA link, so your old backup codes will be invalidated.

I was only hostile regarding you condescendingly urging me to "read again what [you] wrote, and understand what's at stake, before commenting again" as if your initial comment was coherently expressed in direct language and style, when in fact was inscrutably cryptic to those outside of the choir, as evidenced in my honest response questions.
The later two paragraphs of my response were not hostile (in an *ad homininen* or needlessly aggressive sense), they simply disagreed, by raising points that call into question the validity of your initial comments.
In short, I simply pointed out that you did not give even one example of an "involuntary exchange" that bitcoin saves us from.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:43:33
Yikes, why would you quote such a feeble analysis? The predicted chain of events is fragile at every link, and every connection made is a non sequitur.


How so?
If bitcoin is used for daily commerce, then why wouldn't sales tax be collected at point-of-sale on the purchase of goods and services just as it is presently collected on purchases made in cash...?
If employee incomes are paid in bitcoin, then why wouldn't employers report the income paid and collect income tax withholdings just ~~have~~ *as* they presently do when paying incomes in fiat...?
As long as _you're_ seizable, and your government's laws require you to pay up, then you either have your decentralized currency money taxed and/or seized as the law demands or eventually you will be forcibly brought to face legal punishment until you pay dues + penalties. Unless you successfully abandon your past identity and/or go forever into hiding, how will you successfully escape the law with a national (or even international) warrant out for your arrest?

This might not be satisfactory to you, but one bit of ID theft mitigation that everyone who sends verification documents should employ is to use photoshop/[GIMP]( to overlay onto the image a pretty heavy semi-transparent repeating-text watermark, spanning every critical element of the ID/document image.
I use a bold white text with a black border, sized large enough that one repeat of the text spans more-or-less edge-to-edge, then set the watermark layer opacity to 25-50% before flattening the image by saving as JPEG. Doodling the watermark text by hand in your image editor is probably even better.
In the watermark I include the image submission date and "For &lt;Recipient's name&gt; Verification Only". For example:


For Bitstamp Verification Only 2013-12-10  
Verification Only 2013-12-10 For Bitstamp  
2013-12-10 For Bitstamp Verification Only  
For Bitstamp Verification Only 2013-12-10  
Verification Only 2013-12-10 For Bitstamp  
They will still have any information details that you send in your documents, but they won't have a clear photocopy that can be reused for other purposes.

While you are waiting for the USD withdrawal to return the money to you, you are without your fiat *and* your BTC, so you are missing out on BTC's appreciation.
As long as BTC's rate of appreciation (relative to USD) is greater than the profit rate on a full arb cycle (deposit_USD-&gt;buy_BTC-&gt;transfer_BTC-&gt;sell_BTC-&gt;withdrawal_USD-&gt;deposit_USD), by the time that withdrawal goes through and the money arrives in your checking account (weeks or even months later), the new sell price on your initial/buying exchange would be higher than the price at which you sold your BTC, meaning you would have made more money over the same time period if you just stayed on the same exchange for both buying and selling.

The code that it gives when you set up 2FA with them is not a backup code, it's actually the same "shared secret" initialization code that is encoded in the QR code and that is used to seed the time-based 2FA codes. So it's even more than a backup code, it can be manually input into the Google Authenticator app on any device to re-setup the same 2FA account link.
