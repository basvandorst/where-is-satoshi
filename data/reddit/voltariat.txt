The logically flaws in this are ridiculous and the incendiary rhetoric about "the bad guys love it" is offensive to my intelligence.
the author even states plainly the problem with letting humans have regulatory control but then simply argues but do we want to take it away from them because, sniff, they are human. Don't throw me an emotional ploy to protect banks that showed no emotion when they failed us during the bank melt down.
Oh the poor bankers....
Oh the humanity....
ARE WE GOING TO LET OUR COMPUTER OVERLORDS TAKE OVER or are we going to let humans continue to corrupt and manipulate the system?
Um, let the computers take over.

I see some of these housing booms as an effort to find a consistent means to store wealth. If this starts to fall apart I see crypto as being a safe bet to move money to. I know we all want Bitcoin to be a currency but it is working as a really good wealth storage vector. With the stability lately, I could see a new bull market with money for real-estate coming in.
