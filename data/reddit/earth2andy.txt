 Yeah this article is somewhat self defeating when it notes a listing that says "(crypto price subject to change. Inquire crypto price at time of interest)"
This property isn't priced in Cryptos, if it was, it wouldn't matter what the FIAT was worth, the price would be constant in Crypto.

Wow, that's one is a weak argument for the underlying value of bitcoin.  That's not so much "Lies Bitcoin Skeptics Tell Themselves" as it is mental gymnastics people are willing to go through to justify Bitcoin's price.
The key words in there are Efficient and Permissionless.
There are many efficient ways to perform global digital transactions.  Right now most of them are much more efficient than Bitcoin, and likely to stay that way for the long term.
That brings us to 'Permissionless'.  As mentioned above, there are plenty of simple ways to transfer funds around the world right now, so for any permissible transactions, bitcoin is a poor choice.  But for non-permissible transactions, that's a place where bitcoin comes into it's own.
So the real crux of *this* argument for Bitcoin, as far as I can see, is "It's a an end run around international rules and sanctions".  That's not an underlying value that justifies the current Bitcoin price.
There are many other arguments FOR Bitcoin, and I'm not here to debate those, but this specific one seems very weak to me.

They do however have an entire nation (and often other nations) with a vested interest in keeping the purchasing power of the currency relatively stable.
The also have millions of daily transactions where goods and services are exchanged for said currency.
Crypto currencies have none of that, which means they are much less likely to every be stable and thus pretty useless as a currency for the foreseeable future.  If they are not good at being currencies  what exactly makes them worth more than zero?

Let's take distributed healthcare records as an example.
I've read a couple of whitepapers on this as a use for blockchain and it's pretty convincing.  You've got 100s of different entities, all with a financial incentive to contribute to a common distributed database, from an interoperability point of view and an outsourcing the security issue.  They need to keep adding records so there is an incentive for them to invest in the computing power to participate.
That's just one example, I'll bet in the next 10 years 100 better ideas come along that don't revolve around currency.

But paper based fiat currencies have existed for a long long time and  there's a reason they are not included either.  The key is the underlying value of utility.     
Fiat currencies, paper or crypto don't have that.

I don't pretend to be an expert, but as I understand it...
1) Global, standardized, reliable single source of truth, something that doesn't exist today
2) Standarzed distributed security
3) Highly portable
4) Low barrier to entry for new nodes

Blockchain as a technology is fantastic, it will change the way we do electronic business for ever, no question about that.  But that doesn't make bitcoin valuable as a currency, nor does it guarantee any future purchasing power.  It's important to separate the currency aspect from the technology. 
  
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:57
Not true.  
Yes you need the distributed set of "creators "adding items to the system, but it doesn't have to be currency, it could be anything digital (music, games, films, memes!) , as long as there are a people creating new items this system can work.

First of all the computing power required to produce the record isn't as intensive as mining a finite amount of coins, then it offsets the duplicated costs all the providers spend on interoperability and security.
I'm not an expert on the gnats ass detail of the economics, but there's the kernel of an idea there.

Keep in mind these are the same people who are posting in a subreddit where the description says

This!!!!  I am so tired of hearing the "it's going to go up because it will be a currency one day" nonsense.  
By definition it's never going to be used as anything more than an asset or a novelty currency until 
1) It's purchasing power has stayed predictably flat long enough that people have confidence the purchasing power today, will be roughly the same as the purchasing power in 2-3 years.
2) A large number of transactions for goods and services (not just bitcoin to other currencies) are performed in bitcoin.
These two things are the exact opposite of the HODL mentality.  In fact the large number of HODLers waiting for this to become a currency is likely the biggest roadblock to it ACTUALLY becoming a currency :)

Here is the definition of the word commodity.  See if you can spot the difference between bitcoin and a commodity.....
1) A raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee.
2) A useful or valuable thing, such as water or time.

Do they price their goods in Bitcoin, or are they just using it as a payment method not as a currency?
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:46:14
Why are your mugs priced in USD and not Bitcoin (or another crypto).
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:48:17
Do you seriously think that the Dollar is the only free floating currency in the world?  You might want to fact check that ;)
In order for bitcoin to have any actual value, it needs to be adopted as a currency in it’s own right, not just a payment method for fiat.
I see a lot of stories about stores accepting bitcoin as a payment type for fiat.  I see almost no stories about goods being priced in the currency of bitcoin.

3 days later, how are you feeling about that $11k prediction?
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:54:02
Newsflash:  Nobody is using it as a currency now.  Bitcoin has been around for 9-ish years now, and  other than bitcoin mining gear, there's nothing priced in the currency of bitcoin.
Allowing you to pay for an item priced in USD or EURO with Bitcoin is NOT adoption of cryptocurrency, that's cashing in on a fad.

I don't disagree that dollar could end up in a state of high inflation.  But there's no way the US dollar will ever experience the type of inflation bitcoin has seen so far this year.
Your entire premise for why people will buy this much bitcoin by 2020 is built on the idea that bitcoin will have become a very stable store of value that people trust over gold and every other currency on earth.  
Given the wild swings of the last decade (and even the last month) it seems pretty unlikely in just 30 months.  Hell it seems unlikely in 30 years.

Let me just make sure I'm following you here.
Your prediction is it's going to go up by several orders of magnitude and become more widely adopted as a currency at the same time, until it's so widely adopted that the price stabilizes?
The problem is, those two things are mutually exclusive.  People don't spend rapidly appreciating assets unless they absolutely have to, it's the reason that deflation is so scary for a capitalist society.   So it's EITHER rise rapidly OR become widely used, but not both. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:30:25
Mining equipment makes sense, they have always been priced in bitcoin, for obvious reasons.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:58:37
OK, so let's get away from the vagueness and actually agree a way to test your hypothesis. 
Shall we say if it goes over 10.5k by 4/20 you got it right?  If not you got it wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:39:27
Your point is mostly right, it only takes one transaction at $20k to push the market cap up.  
However your second point is wrong.  Every bitcoin holder (or hodler) can refuse to sell for less than $20K, but that won't make the price worth $20k, you need a buyer willing buy at that price too.
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:38:59
But that’s not buying with bitcoin, that’s shifting bitcoin into usd and purchasing in usd right?
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:38:37
The problem with your argument is you're assuming the value of bitcoin stays static, which we all know it doesn't.
Let's pretend the dollar hyperinflation you're predicting (50%/yr?) had started Jan 1st this year.  If you took $2000 on Jan 1 put half of it in Bitcoin and half of it you left in paper dollars, the paper dollars would still be able to buy you more today than the bitcoin.  Even with the dollar losing 50%/yr of it's purchasing power, because bitcoin is falling faster.
Over the last (almost) decade bitcoin has been more volatile than every currency on earth.  More volatile than any major commodity!  Given that there's no end in sight to that volatility, there are are *literally* thousands of better places to put your money than bitcoin to protect yourself against inflation.  So why do you think bitcoin is going to be the vehicle of choice for so many people by 2020?

This is a little bit the point of my question.  In lurking around this sub, I'm noticing that everyone seems to be hodling until this becomes a mainstream currency, but not spending it.  However if even the most devoted crypto-philes aren't buying things with it, then who is, and how do you think it will gain popularity?
I see a lot of posts about xxxxx now accepts bitcoin, but there's a real lack of I bought xxxxxx with bitcoin.

Not quite true.
Person A has an agreement with the bank that they can withdraw $1000.  They don’t actually have $1000
In the scenario you’re describing above of a ‘run-on-the-bank’, the bank either has to borrow the money to cover the withdrawals or it closes it’s doors and the government (through the FDIC program) gives the depositor back their $1000.
That’s why you see bank accounts saying FDIC insured up to $250,000, that’s what it means.
The bank doesn’t try to unwind the loan from person B.

I grew up in England so I’ve experienced both tax systems.  The US one is ridiculous, but you pay a lot less tax than you do in the UK so it’s well worth it.
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:14:11
Mate, stop talking about things you clearly don’t understand, you’re just looking like an ignorant fool now.
The US system is different to the UK system, but of course you’re not taxed on losses.  There is however a cut off dates each year (just like there is in the UK) and if you make a profit in one year, you can’t use projected losses from the next year to avoid paying them (can’t do that in the UK either).

I’ve heard this meme so many times now, and it mostly seems to be based on a misunderstanding of how fractional reserve lending works.
The confusion goes like this
Myth: banks only need to hold 10% in reserves of the loans they give.  So if a bank has $1,000 in deposits it can lend out $10,000 in loans.  That created money!!!!
Reality:  A bank with $1000 in reserves can only lend out $900.  Money changes hands but is not created.

This calendar year, bitcoin has seen roughly 250&amp; inflation.  I know that's better than Venezuela's 700&amp; but given that there are so many seemingly more stable options, why are they not buying gold, or dollars or Euros or something else more stable than bitcoin?  Are there just no options for Venezuelans to access the FX markets, or even gold?

[Note: I edited above because I missed the assumption that he sold them for USD so he technically had the money at some point].
I'm sure he had the money to pay the taxes at one point, probably only briefly, and instead of reserving that part of the profit to pay his taxes, he put it all into alt coins and lost it.  But because the profit and the loss happened in different tax years they don't offset each other and he's in this situation.
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:57:52

Not enough detail in the story to say if this is the case or not, but here is a situation that could happen.
Buy in Jan 2017 sell in December 2017.  That means that you've held the coin for less than 12 months meaning that it's 'short term capital gains' not 'long term capital gains'.  In the US short term capital gains are treated as regular income.
Because he sold in 2017 and I'm assuming sold for USD, this is a 2017 taxable event and the amount of profit will be considered regular income, just like if he'd got a bonus at work without paying taxes on it and is added to his 2017 income when the IRS calculates taxes due (the US tax year is Jan 1 to Dec 31st)
My guess is he sold them for USD then waited a few days and bought some Alt coins. which he held into 2018, so now, if he sells them in 2018 at a loss that will be a taxable event in 2018 and can not be used to offset the tax he owes from his profit in 2017.
He can carry forward any investment losses he incurs in 2018 to future years (at the rate of $3,000 a year) so he will eventually get back to even on this mess, but that doesn't change the fact his tax bill for 2017 still has to be paid!
