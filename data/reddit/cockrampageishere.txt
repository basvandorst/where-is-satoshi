Some people are waiting for capitulation to around 8-10k, then a proper bounce and continued growth to 30k. We currently have no volume on all sides. Every pump attempt is getting rejected more and more. Plenty of longs are under water. Pretty bearish overall. That's what I heard anyway.

Whales taking profits and fucking up the market as usual. It isn't news related.

If you want to lose money then sell. If you want to make more money then close the price chart and come back in a month.

Imagine what people thought when it jumped from couple of cents to 100 usd. This is nothing in retrospective.

Because wiping out Bitcoin Cash isn't our mission. These hate threads are starting to annoy me just as much as r/btc. No bueno.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:54:45
Bigger blocks are literally cancer.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:05:17
That is not a proper solution. I want to use BTC as a store of value and cash. Waiting for LN patiently.

I was just wondering when is he coming back. Nice.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:00:40
I will never understand this fear of telling how much you have. You show people that you're rich and paint a target on your back every time you drive a nice car, wear nice clothes, buy nice things. The only way to hide that money is to not spend it.

Alex Jones, is that you?
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:06:44
He's gonna reevaluate his holdings.

Hey, it's me, your friend.
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:46:16
No, Mr. Love_eggs_and_bacon, it's people who can't control their eating habits made themselves sick and fat.

Or you could just do it from your phone if you download the coinbase app.

If I could invest more than ~50$ a month I would move from my microscopic town/country to get some job opportunities. I don't need much, just give me a livable place, because all I can see from my window is old people, drunks, soviet bricks and depression. If I stay here, I'm pretty sure I'll die alone.

0.01424055 is 142.23$
I smell something fishy.

Don't FOMO, dude. It's not smart to buy when it's on a mega bull run for days...
Ask yourself why do you actually want to buy right now and not wait for a drop.
If you're going to buy then don't panic when it drops, probably bellow your entry price too.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:55:43
From what I gathered big blocks are like heroin, you want happiness, and you want it now. Sure it feels good and it works at first. But then you want more... and more. Until you can't stop. You overdose.
It's not the only solution to the problem. So why  rush? We can take our time and make something better.
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:36:24
I don't care.

@_date: 2017-09-01 08:08:37
Oh please let it slow the fuck down for a year. I can only invest so much...
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:47:38
Bought 9 minutes before the drop. FML.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:17:33
[Here you go](
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:54:22
Dude, just close the fucking price window and do something else. You expect it to perform miracles in a couple of hours/days? Remember why you bought. If you want out then get out. If you want in then stay in and stop shitting bricks at every jerk the market makes.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:24:02
Just download Exodus or something like that. Print your private keys and hide them somewhere safe.

If it has that scene then it's a good one.

Tbh we can return above the line in a week if it pumps like in December. (We jumped ~5k in ~3 days)

I kinda dislike and understand the "censuring" here. It seems shady indeed, but it also keeps things clean and only about Bitcoin. Which I like. I get the news and move on. This sub is about Bitcoin only. 
r/btc seems so filthy, look at the number of threads hating on Bitcoin. It is filled with hatred and conspiracies. Even now, they're more focused on hating, than celebrating that BCH seemingly started to make actual steady growth.
Bitcoin Cash seems like a normal crypto (ignoring some potentially shady things and Roger Ver's lies/half-truths), but their aggressiveness towards Bitcoin making them very unappealing. 
I don't even understand this feud. Why can't people just mind their own fork. It's not like there's only room for one.
