That, more than anything else, is the Dogecoin community in a nutshell.

I'm a shibe, and I downvoted.
Please don't try to pick fights like this, it doesn't help anybody.  Not even Doge.

I dunno, I think the situations are different between BTC and Doge.  Doge is barely over a month old, so their primary objective is to gain exposure.  Meanwhile, BTC has a pretty darn good chunk of exposure, so right now they're pushing for legitimacy.
It would probably be a good all-round thing for the BTC community to also back the Jamaican bobsled team, but the motivations would be completely different.  Also, I'm not even sure that the core BTC community even wants to be associated with what could be construed as "backing a country".

I am in no way surprised that so many people still think Bitcoin is a scam.  Why?  Because up until December of last year, I was one of them.
We're talking about money that only exists on the internet, appears to be created out of thin air by running some crazy program, and the stories that reach the public all have to do with drug dealers, mass theft and incompetent exchanges.  Lets face it people: **Bitcoin's first impression is godawful.**
I know better now.  I've gotten the gist of how things work, and I'm now convinced that BTC is at least the harbinger of things to come (...TBH I'm convinced that 20 years from now, we won't be using BTC itself to buy things, but rather some altcoin, known or unknown, and BTC will exist as a gold standard).  But it really took a lot of poking and prodding for me to finally accept that Bitcoin wasn't a scam.  To be blunt, it was stories of *profit* that convinced me, even though I've never day traded and I've tried to mine on slush's pool with a GT 650m.

Sorry, Dorian, you're now one of the faces of Bitcoin, even if you don't want to be.

What is "ConspiracyCoin"?
...seriously, saying that Satoshi Nakamoto doesn't exist is blatantly false.  We know for absolute certain that Satoshi exists - we just don't know is **who or what** they are.  Therefore, to believe that Satoshi doesn't exist at all is to believe in a conspiracy theory, which makes ConspiracyCoin the actual correct answer.

Bah, /b/ in its traffic prime was hordes of high schoolers circle jerking; arguably worse than Reddit.  4chan is only "good" now because all those guys mass-migrated to Reddit, whereas 4chan is 90% oldfags now.

Hence the "probably".  I haven't been in any crypto long enough to nail down the motivations for anybody except Doge, and even then I'm not 100% sure what the agreed motivation is.

From what I've seen and read so far, isn't difficulty actually tied to Transactions, not Mining?
It doesn't change the idea that the difficulty in making money off mining is unlikely to decrease, ever, but the actual difficulty level of any given block has the potential to dip if the raw number of transactions performed also dips.
