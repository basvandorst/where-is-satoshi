There are places you can buy XMR with fiat.(localmonero.com) And because of its obfuscated nature it's like it never existed at all. You don't want formal exchanges exactly for something that is meant for privacy. Because formal exchanges have rules and identity verification.
That's not to say you can't still use it secretly after a formal acquisition since it is so private.

Pretty shitty article haha.
Touches on bitcoin scaling problems and things that could fix it. (Despite transactions occurring with lowest fees ever as of recently) 
And just speculated that Ethereum will double its market cap because of ICOs.
Although these things are correct the article is just kinda pissing in the wind with no real substance.
Any good article is good in my books though.

What do you mean if it worked as advertised? You mean fast worldwide payments almost instantly with little fees whilst simultaneously cutting out the middleman known as banks who use the money of hardworking citizens to fatten their already stuffed pockets?
Do you mean rising in value due to a choked and hard capped supply that naturally increases the value so long as demand is consistent?
Because they do this just fine.
What do you really know about crypto?
And why have you neglected to acknowledge the other cryptos I have listed rather than making your argument about BTC solely?
I'm not smart enough to break down our current economic system to a tee and I do still enjoy, good ol dollars.
But that doesn't change the fact that it's a system filled with corruption. And doesn't change the fact that their are currencies with such great utility that they will ALWAYS be used.

Sounds like you've been listening to the guru Dr Jordan Peterson :)

Stripe recently stopped using it for their platform. BTC is volatile so it makes sense not to use it as a currency... for now. 
What about USDT though? Crypto dollars backed by real money.
People who refuse to accept crypto as a revolution have their heads in the sand. You can't use BTC and its characteristics as a sweeping criticism for the whole spectrum of cryptos. This new world is crazy. Whether they will be officially accepted as legal tender or not is irrelevant. People have been accepting them for payments regardless of the concensus from society.
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:28:34
Okay, this is fair enough. It is your money to decide what to do and if the problem concerns you then go ahead.
I just am not a fan of the extreme SJW and feminist movement.
This type of thinking got James Damore fired from google for outlining the biological and sociological differences that strongly influence the gender gap in the tech industry. He also outlined ways in which women could change the statistic and ways that society could help them be interested in building a career in tech.
He was fired for presenting his nuanced outlook on the issue.
The CEO of YouTube echoed some of his thoughts last month very hypocritically;
I do think that it would be awesome for there to be more women in tech but I don't think it is charity worthy.
Women outweigh men 20:1 in the medical field. Where is the charity for men to be more prominent in that industry? It doesn't exist. You know why? Because people make their own choices in life.
Men outweigh women in engineering 20:1.
These are just a reflection of the sociological differences between genders and to blindly ignore those facts in the pursuit of equality of outcome is outrageous.
I don't personally know about the internal environment of tech and venture capital and I'm sure there are many human relations issues but tech speaks for itself. If you write a groundbreaking piece of code, it doesn't matter whether you have a penis or not. Good tech is good tech.
Same with entrepreneurship.
Jeff bezos could have been a female.
Do you think that just because he's male it made it any easier to start a revolution in ecommerce?
Perhaps it did, perhaps not.
I don't know.. like I said.. you're able to donate wherever you feel and you're a champion for doing so. I shouldn't be so critical.
I just find SJW crap to be getting way out of hand.

The block size does matter to a degree. But it is negligible when the blocks have 100kbs in them. High fees are driven by consumer demand that comes from having full blocks. So yes, theoretically the fees will be lower in Bitcoin Cash for quite a lot longer than Bitcoin because people won’t be competing to get the transaction in the next block.
But on chain scaling with just a block increase is a band aid fix.
It’s a linear improvement model that isn’t sustainable without further centralising the mining that will not be able to handle exponential growth.
It is great for now.. but time will tell who wins the race for adoption and who will scale better.
I do try to stay unbiased and competition is good.
I just wish there wasn’t such a division in the community over it.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:54:25
Bitcoin Cash has low tx fees because their blocks are empty though..

It takes years for new payment methods to be accepted. Yes, crypto is valued with dollars at this moment.
But people weren't too happy when bank notes came in.
It's disruptive technology.. change doesn't happen overnight.
Especially when a system is as old as our current money system.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:20:02
Yes. You can for sure pay for those things.
I can pay my bills right now with it.
There's third party companies that will do the this for you.
But with a wide variety of businesses accepting it, it's also becoming a direct method of payment.
Not to mention BTC ATMs popping up everywhere.
Here's one example of being able to pay for anything that accepts credit and debit card payments.
Here's an example of real estate
Heres an article about paying your tax with crypto in Arizona 
Healthcare is next but like I said, there are services that allow you to pay for anything at all with crypto.
Also, Japan has 260000+ stores that accept crypto since it became legal tender last year.

Fiat is a measure of good faith.. you're correct.
Now see Venezuela, Zimbabwe, India and what has happened to their dollars and tell me that can't happen to any country's currency at any time.

It doesn't change the fact that BTC still has a decentralised structure outside of LN.
And you are still able to send money without remittance if it's international.
It also doesn't change the distribution of power among the network.
It's impossible to have a truly decentralised network anyway when ASIC farms are in play.
Also, I heard Andreas Antonopolous talking about multi layer encryption of transactions between nodes. Meaning, at each hop, the node will know where to send it next and that's it. It won't know where it came from or whom it's going to if it's in the middle of a chain. It may know where it's coming from directly before it actually but it only knows of two addresses max. Not sure if this is implemented or is in the works because I didn't pay a lot of attention.
Bitcoin is still in limited supply and cannot be hyper inflated.
There are still many benefits to bitcoin. Chill out

Unless you live near the guy you're gonna have to find a way to transport those items. This is why we don't use gold anymore.
The current monetary system is accepted, but that doesn't give it value. It's a mystery to me how USA can be in so many trillions of debt and still have a strong currency.
Yet China produces more than 50% of the worlds goods and has a relatively weak currency.
Also, when you pay someone online you have no anonymity whatsoever. If you live in a country where you could be persecuted for your religious beliefs, take India for example, you may find the use of a currency such as XMR as a viable option for buying a bible.
And as I said, USDT is backed by dollars.
Also, DigixDAO is backed by gold. 
Smart contract platforms are also extremely valuable as they save time and money that would be spent on costly lawyers and potential litigation.
Factom is one example of a crypto that is trying to revolutionise file systems.
File systems are costly to maintain and have central points of failure whether it be physical file cabinets that could be burnt down or hard drives that could be destroyed or hacked.
Also, if you get injured in another country and have to go to hospital the doctors will have a very hard time trying to track down your medical history. Distributed file ledgers could make the process a lot easier and potentially save lives in this field.
Crypto is a pandemic. Whether the current ones survive is another question but blockchain is going to rapidly find its way into many sectors.
Despite what the name suggest, these are not just currencies and do not rely on global adoption to be worth something.
You can trust financial institutions, fractional reserve banking and inflationary currency.
Bitcoin was born out of a recession because the current monetary system is not good enough and a lot of people are fed up.

1 million to an organisation trying to reduce the gender gap in entrepreneurship and venture capital?
Come on... that's ridiculous.
Guys have a steep learning curve in those fields too.
This is not gender equality.. this is special treatment.

Thanks Kalin :)
I am not knowledgeable on the mining process. Have just heard the word cryptographic equation. And was wondering if it was possible to do it with your brain. I knew it was going to be a ridiculous time frame. You know what they say though.. To get a perfect answer you must first know the perfect question. Which I did not :P
