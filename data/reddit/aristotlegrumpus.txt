Current 5-year CD rate at my local credit union is 2.65%
Current inflation rate - 1.8%
It might be safe, but a CD is barely more of an "investment" than your mattress these days

Average age of cars on the road in the USA is 12 years. A 2002 model is not an outdated relic.
The rest of your *"why not just drop 20k?"* brag/rant seems to assume that nobody does maintenance on vehicles or ever heard of things like getting new brakes instead of buying an entirely new car.

Can you explain what you're saying here?
I'm a newb in a pretty much identical situation as OP.

Youtube has conducted a lot of "quiet purges" in the last few years - banning or demonetizing lots of political channels, firearms channels, education/history channels, etc.
The political censorship has been obvious (and growing) there for years, and now I think they are trying to clamp down hard on people who utilize or promote any kinds of alternative payment systems.
As we all know, lots of powerful entities don't like the idea of cryptocurrency because they can't control/tax/steal it as easily as other forms of money. 
And that's not just governments and banks. Plenty of big online companies make a lot of *their* money from doing nothing more than moving *your* money around, and tracing how you spend it.
Models like eBay and paypal stand to lose a shitload as bitcoin becomes more and more widely adopted, and other huge operations (like Alphabet) who want a piece of that moving-money-around-the-internet market - as well as selling the data that comes from tracking it - see that crypto cuts them right the fuck out of the loop.

Yes, I see most of your comment history is spamming very similar "Bitcoin must be government-regulated!" propaganda.
Here's your answer: We don't think in terms of all your beloved middleman government bureaucracy and legalized theft because cryptocurrency is not about serving as a tool for government tax collectors and yes, you said it because you know it fits... CORRUPT BANKERS.
I find it hilariously ironic that a Swiss ~~Nazi Gold~~ Banker - of ALL people - is trying to lecture us about the morality of managing, storing, and exchanging wealth. I think maybe you're simply worried that bitcoin is going to replace you, or at least put a big dent in YOUR laundering business.
One of the defining aspects of cryptocurrency is allowing people to exchange wealth as freely as possible. Since you make your living as a middleman/launderer, you don't like that idea. We get it.
We aren't CONFUSED or IGNORING the things you claim are your problems with bitcoin - we don't see those things as problems. We see people like YOU as the problem, and bitcoin was designed explicitly to *evade* your control.

Good luck selling your house and all that, but... lmao at this.


I'm sure you meant to say ONLY during winter, which is like 3 months of autumn temps, then back to 9 months of boiling  summer
