Sorry, dude, but I really wouldn't do anything connecting with money without 2FA, even if it's crypto. It's just insecure. 
Maybe CEX is wrong by not communicating it directly, but still it's not a crime on their side to ask you to secure your account, huh? 
@_date: 2016-04-29 09:24:26
cool, then it works for mastercard as well, thanks for the feedback

The easiest way to describe a Bitcoin wallet is to think of it as the place where your bitcoins are stored, but it’s really much more than that. There are many different types of wallets that people use these days, and understanding how to use a Bitcoin wallet is the only way to make sure that you learn how to use the Bitcoin payment network correctly. After all, there’s no need for banks in Bitcoin, so you can be in complete control of your bitcoins if that’s what you want to do.
Public and Private Keys 
Like most other forms of online wallets or bank accounts, your Bitcoin wallet comes with a username and password. In the case of Bitcoin, the username is your public Bitcoin address, and your password is the private key associated with that address. You can share your public Bitcoin address with people if you want them to send you a payment. Your public Bitcoin address is kind of like your email address. If you want to send payments to someone else, then you’ll need to have access to the private key associated with the Bitcoin address. It’s also important to note that you can actually have as many public key and private combinations as you want in your Bitcoin wallet. It actually makes sense to give different people different public Bitcoin addresses for payments if you don’t want people to be able to track your financial activities.
Bitcoin takes advantage of cryptography to secure everyone’s accounts, and you can look at your private key as your signature confirming that you are who you say you are. The only difference between this cryptographic signature and the one you use to sign real documents is that this one cannot be forged.
Your Private Keys are Your Bitcoins
Once you understand how Bitcoin works, it becomes obvious that you aren’t actually holding any bitcoins in your wallet. All you are holding is the private key that allows you to make adjustments to the public, decentralized ledger known as the Bitcoin blockchain. In reality, your private keys are the most valuable aspect of your wallet, so that’s what you need to think about more than anything else when it comes to security. As long as your private keys are secure, no one will be able to hack or steal your bitcoins. It’s also important to remember that you won’t be able to use your bitcoins either if you lose your private keys. This is due to the fact that there’s no “forgot password” function on the Bitcoin network.
Web Wallets
Web wallets are usually considered the most convenient Bitcoin wallets for beginners. In most cases, the website behind your web wallet will store your private keys for you, and you will only be able to access them with a normal username and password to the website. The most secure web wallets also allow for forms of two-factor authentication. For example, you can have a text message sent to you every time you login to your CEX.IO account. That text message will contain a secondary password that changes every time you login to your account. This means that someone would have to have your account’s password and physical access to your phone if they wanted to get into your account. There have been many thefts and hacks in the web wallet space due to the fact that users are not in full control of their private keys. MtGox was the most famous case of users losing their bitcoins, and you always need to be careful about where you’re storing your private keys. Remember, the person who owns the private keys is the person who owns the bitcoins.
Don’t Lose Your Wallet
One last point that needs to be made when it comes to Bitcoin wallets is the bitcoins in those wallets are like the cash dollars, euros, or other fiat currencies you keep in your normal wallet. If you lose your Bitcoin wallet, you lose your bitcoins. Remember that bitcoins are essentially digital cash. Once you hand your bitcoins to someone else or happen to misplace your private keys, there is no central authority who is going to be able to get those bitcoins back for you.

No cloud mining provider can make your investment profitable unless you have the ability to mine and trade as with CEX. All other cloud miners give you something  like a 12 month contract with no way of getting money out except in the mining rewards.

You can do this on cex.io exchange. They will require you to verify your card though.
@_date: 2014-06-11 11:39:50
There will be no liquidity issues on CEX for sure. Plus the GHS price has been trending up past 6 weeks or so now gives you the opportunity to make cloud mining dividends and profit from trading GHS.

We need to spend Bitcoin day to day to increase broader adoption.

End of 2013 the estimate was that ONLY around 280,000 people actually owned any Bitcoin.
Samsung employs around 270,000 
We can all help the growth by participating actively - Spending, Tipping, Mining, Trading.
So maybe instead of 'To the Moon' we should shout...."To Samsung.....And Beyond" (Thanks Buzz Lightyear for using your copyrighted quote)

Well, bitcoin is pretty good in terms of savings, so why not use it as a retirement option. But, like any risky investment, keep in mind that you will need to track the price constantly and read market news 
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:12:20
Kraken is more for traders and tech savvy guys, not newbies, for sure. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:48:23
I have some ETH, but I do not expect their price going to the moon. I had some LTC and DOGE a few years ago, and I am not playing those games anymore.
Main part of my crypto funds are in Bitcoin.

I think this is the case when everybody can have its own Moon

I've seen people working in Bitcoin-accepting spots not really that much into the currency themselves. This has always surprised me. Is the coffee guy a Bitcoin enthusiast himself or is he enthusiastic about everything (which would mean he makes great coffee)?
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:52:32
I am starting to think that some companies are trying to promote themselves by adding BTC payments... So, they are no particularly interested in the payments, but in spreading the word in bitcoin community or across crypto media
@_date: 2017-02-28 11:37:54
yes, I agree about the potential, but I'm just not feeling as confident about ETH and envision risks now, although risking in this case can bring higher income. 
maybe I am simply more used to Bitcoin and we need time with ETH to become close friends, you know ;)
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:10:22
what exactly do you want to test? if you need dust on your Bitcoin wallet, you can go ahead and use faucets or any websites that give you Satoshis for clicking on the links, for example.
but if you are intending to eventually buy Bitcoin, start looking around and choose a Bitcoin exchange that suits you most in terms of payment methods, fees and geographical position. I used Coinbase for certain period of time, then moved to CEX.IO
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:38:59
Yes, you can do that on exchanges with multiple pairs, like BTC/USD and BTC/EUR. CEX.IO, for example
@_date: 2017-02-13 12:03:19
i too feel that bitcoin price will go higher over the upcoming several years. 
i personally buy btc on CEX.IO ( Exactly, many exchanges shut down, but this service remains on the market and i haven't heard that they were hacked or so. What appeals to me is that they are officially registered in the UK (not in China or somewhere faraway) and that you can buy bitcoins with your credit card. It is pretty easy, and they also have a trade page, so if you are intending to trade btc later on, you can try it out on cex.io as well. so, you get 2 in 1 services — easy purchase and trading.
so, anyways, i am happy that more people are getting into bitcoin, and, as i possess some and trade bitcoins, i am interested in massive bitcoin adoption. 
good luck and may btc rise to the moon
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:57:53
try out cex.io, they accept credit cards, and if you use the trade interface (if you place orders), then you will be charged a deposit fee of 3.5% + $ 0.25 and 0.2% for exchange operation
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:46:44
I always keep telling: the money you haven't lost is the money you actually earned. Try not to think about the money you could have earned. Better focus on what you can do now. 
Bitcoin can still go up, you know..
@_date: 2017-03-06 11:48:21
It was. In the past life of Bitcoin.
Now better buy and hold or trade
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:56:28
nope, cex.io and coinmama accept credit cards as well
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:25:32
I try not to advise anything related to investments. And, in my opinion, buying and selling crypto relate to investments. 
I just think that my mistakes should be my mistakes.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:36:23
Well... I believe, many of them. But as Bitcoin is divisible, I am patient about that. Maybe in a couple of years, we will be more dealing with Satoshi
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:06:39
Anyway I like the idea of Bits
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:17:54
been using cex.io for a long time. have nothing bad to say about them. quick deposits and withdrawals, fees are average for the market. good support.
in terms of trading, they have a mobile app, APIs. maybe their liquidity is not the largest, but it suits my needs in full. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:06:36
It will definitely drive bitcoin price movements, not sure in which direction though
@_date: 2016-11-15 10:26:36
I guess Bitcoin was, is and will be the most important cryptocurrency. Not only the capitalization works for it. It was just the first one, and for now, it has no equals. Bitcoin is the brand of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-01-26 13:44:40
I saw that CEX.IO launched btc/gbp. so that means that you can buy/sell btc for gbp using credit card
@_date: 2016-11-23 11:32:22
Ok, I see. Good luck then!
@_date: 2016-11-15 10:31:00
There are two types of Bitcoin newcomers and various scenarios apply for them
1) People who are new to Bitcoin and trading — in this case, it will be safer for you to simplu buy Bitcoin, invest in crypto and wait till the price goes up. Or, try out trading, but with the amount of money you are not afraid to lose.
2) People who are traders, but new to Bitcoin — if you are a trader, but have operated with other currencies or commodities, then choose the platform for trading that suits you most, and get into Bitcoin trading. I mean, if you can analyze charts and understand the market, everything will be ok. Of course, there is no guarantee, cause Bitcoin price is volatile and sometimes unpredictable. But is trading fully predictable at all?
@_date: 2016-11-23 08:54:39
I withdraw funds from cex to my VISA card. Why wait several days if I cant get the money instantly and for just $3.80, regardless of the amount? My friends use that option too, no issues at all.
I get it that you lave large amounts, but you can just upgrade your account to verified plus or how it is called, and withdraw more.
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:03:16
I used to have AirBitz and Breadwallet. Both were ok, but I also needed trading functionality, so I moved to using CEX.IO app later on. I've got an account there, so it's pretty comfy to have it all in one app. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:12:41
That's really interesting, cause just a few years ago there were lots of cafés and hotels who were willing to hang a "Bitcoin Accepted Here" sign on their doors. It was called Bitcoin adoption and everybody in the community was happy about that...
I get the problem of the block size, but still. Bitcoin should be democratic in terms of how to use it, imho
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:02:17
I've been using Coinbase and CEX.IO. Over the past year, I moved to regular Bitcoin purchases and trading on CEX, because I had some unpleasant experience with Coinbase and I do not like the lack of privacy there. 
Anyways, CEX.IO is a good option if you want to buy btc with credit card. They support many countries and have been long in the industry. I don't remember they were ever hacked, unlike Bitfinex or Bitstamp, for example, and that is a strong argument. I also brought some friends to the exchange who are total newbies to Bitcoin, and the experience was good enough. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:56:37
The world now has a wide choice: fiat money, electronic money, gold... Cryptocurrency joined these money forms. 
I think that people would rather choose how to pay, instead of jumping into one payment method only.

Coinmap.org doesn't show a very bright picture of Bitcoin acceptance in Turkey right now, especially when compared to other European countries. There is also mixed information on what happened to the ATM in the Ataturk Airport. Hopefully, the situation is changing.

I think there will be some, especially since CoinDesk mentioned their offer yesterday. I'm wondering, what trading pairs will be affected the most

No, certainly not everyone. Quite the opposite, people tend to sell more when the price falls. The author says that the price will rise when the coins are sold by makers

I do some from time to time. My tips would be to read general information, Investopedia is a useful tool. I also read different price roundups, like they have on blog.cex.io – something like a detailed analysis of price behaviour and what's behind it.   
Also, there is this general tip – buy low, sell high, which is obvious, but can be hard to tell where those lows and highs are )
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:22:32
I'd do some trading (I find it's far better than gambling). Or I would take a tour of Bitcoin-accepting locations
