My asscheeks believe Bitcoin is headed to $4 in 3 months. And they're about equally as credible as the clowns from the article!

I have an extremely credible and reliable source, and it's pretty much 100% right 10% of the time, and it's called "pure speculation".
Incidentally, literally *everyone else* who makes *any* prediction about the price into *any* direction has the exact same source, regardless of whether they call themselves "experts" or not. It sure goes around!

Something something past performance something something future movements.

Lunar New Year might be what *started* the dive, but it's not what's going to make it taller and taller and taller and taller. Panic is.
How many people have bought in after $10k? How many people decided to jump on the hype train, hoping for a get-rich-quick scheme? Those are all jumping off now. 
That's the thing about a bubble. Once the needle hits, it goes pop.

Who decides Bitcoin's value? Who says that it was still "undervalued" at 20k?
Bitcoin is worth exactly what people are willing to pay for it. It's an immaterial good, and that's really stretching the meaning of the word "good". Right now, that's about $7.5k. That number may go up, or it may drop further, but there is _no way_ to reliably predict this. Past events do not future performance make.
Don't pretend to be enlightened. Don't pretend as if you know better. You're gambling, and your predictions are nothing but conjecture. Bitcoin may have reached its peak, or it may be worth a million bajillion dollars at the end of the year, or it may drop all the way down to a fiver - all of these scenarios are a possible outcome. The point is that *nobody* can predict which of them will come true, least of all a random redditor with ulterior motives whose investment really relies on people not selling.
