That chart does not really show the size that a full node would need. As you can read head it is around 10 times smaller. 
New version of geth will also bring sync times down.

Because it is creating a bubble with fake money?

Define sustain. 2MB would lower fees and 8MB even more.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:28:21
So why are the fees still so high? Oh wait lightning is not fully ready yet and still has to be adopted by everyone. The fees will be very high for at least a couple more months if we are being optimistic.

It seems like I was wrong. From what I am reading is that it will be cheaper if your change address is also a segwit address but that this is not the case in most wallet software. Right now it would be hard for me to move to a segwit address since it will cost me $30.

I am dyslexic and make quite some mistakes while writing but even I am annoyed by your writing. If you write like a 5 year old no one will take your arguments seriously.

Yea a $5 bitcoin transaction is supposed to cost $30 in fees. Stop being delusional.

Just use [tabs](
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:31:56
You think a scammer is making 1000s of transactions with $30 fees? These are people trying to use bitcoin as intended.

At least it will lower the fees until lightning is released. 1MB is not some magical limit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:37:17
Would it be bad if some people with really shit internet could not run a node. There will still be millions of other who can. Especially outside of the US where the internet is not fucked over by big ISPs. Right now the high fees are preventing many people from being able to use bitcoin.

There is a block every 10 min and even people with 15Mbps will be able to upload a block in seconds. It is not like 1MB is some magical limit and 2MB will break the whole system.

It is forever in the cryptocurrency market. Look at the price of bitcoin 6 months ago. Now imagine bitcoin stagnating for 6 months while the other coins continue to grow.

Segwit is not mandatory and has no direct benefit for the user. Only if enough people would use it you will get a benefit but this is not enough motivation for adoption it seems.

This comment aged well.

This will only work for trading cryptocurrency, not for trading fiat to crypto.

You might want to turn on spelling checker.


On their website they claim to be transparent and have regular audits which we still have to see.

It will take at least months for lightning adoption when it is released.

MD5 and SHA1 are hashing algorithms which is different from encryption. Normally passwords are hashed not encrypted. I wonder if they encrypted the password hashes also and what kind of algorithms they used.

A true shitcoin

Coinmarketcap disagrees. Why is there such a big difference between these 2 sites?
