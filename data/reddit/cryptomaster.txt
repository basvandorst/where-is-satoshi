My dad bought some too.  Totally sneaking up on me... maybe they've just been waiting for capitulation, haha.

I think if US took a Brazil-like approach to the regulation of bitcoin, in that, it doesn't care about joe shmoe user's capital gains, then I think it would be a lot more reasonable.
Brazil now has one of the best regulatory frameworks that the bitcoin community there could possibly ask for.  I'd like to see the same here.

THere are several organizations taking advantage of this already.  As well as other crypto's making it a part of their culture.  Namely NOBLEcoin and Worldcoin.

I wonder if Slush could/would switch our pool over to a P2P infrastructure.  I'd love to hear his take on it.  No pool owner cares about the bitcoin community and health of the overall ecosystem than slush.
What do you guys reckon?

I got my dad into Bitcoin.  He bought 3.5 btc 3 weeks ago, and he's had two antminers for about a month.  Needless to say, he's a happy camper today!

Its funny because this space creates fanatics for the most part.  But also some casual users too...
I think of my coinbase referral list (its about 8 strong so far), about 5 of them bought at least 100 bucks worth, some bought a couple bitcoins to hold, one of my friends does some short term speculation, but I've even created two miners out of friends, and turned a half dozen strangers into first time miners by selling them an Antminer S1 at essentially face value.  What did I wake up to a couple weeks ago?  An e-mail from a friend showing their purchase of another antminer.
The best part?  People want to talk about it, and ask you about it, and slowly but surely they start to snowball into fanatics and tell their friends about it.  Long story short, there are far more people entering this space than leaving it.  Crypto will get a lot more fun and interesting the more players we get involved.  Tell your friends ;)!

Can we all just agree that having 21.5 BTC in a hot or warm form is ridiculous no matter the security measures you take?  
I get a little weasy when I haven't exported out anything over 2 btc, let alone 20.  This was negligence on your part OP, I hate to say.  Unless you are a millionaire, losing 20+ BTC is painful.  
What you did was the equivalent of leaving $13,000 on your porch under the mat.  Sure, no one knew it was there except for the wife, but have no illusions that it was never, by any stretch of the imagination, remotely secure.
I have several paper wallets with BIP38, and encrypted Ironkeys in multiple locations, as well as additional physical security and codes for accessing them.  I still get a little weirded out over security.  I don't like having wallets with more than 3-4 BTC in it.  The idea of sweeping or something happening losing 5 btc, especially in the theoretical future value times, is mind-numbingly scary.
The fact that you casually left 21.5 BTC on your phone means you really could give a shit if someone stole it, or were prepared for that risk.  People who have far less than you keep far larger %'s of their btc in cold storage, and its about time more people start doing this.
For everyone out there reading this, unless you are waiting for your circle insurance policy, you better take your bitcoin management into your own hands, because once that shits gone, no government, insurance company, or charity will save you.

Well, if people are still mining dogecoin when the block reward is 10k, that means the price would have to have gone up, or the miner base would diminish to the point so much so, that a multipool could fork it, making it a dead effort anyway.  So, just think of it this way, if we were mining bitcoin, and people were still mining it if the block reward was 1 btc instead of 25, then one of the two above scenarios would have to happen.

There is always something I liked about Glenn Beck.  He has never been one that felt the need to protect the status quo, at least that much is for sure.  Thanks for the post.

Thank you for taking the time to explore Bitcoin.  I hope your experience is a positive one!
@_date: 2014-02-18 00:37:25
I have just started on this and will be seeking a grant from the bitcoinfoundation as I just became a member today, and hopefully I can have the two bars I have already on board with this ready by late this week or next for proof of concept.  I would like to find people in the area or from the meetup group that would be interested in helping!  Thanks!

I'm curious to see if this coin even survives the mere 10k doge block reward.  If it does, by golly my 500,000k doge will seem like a fortune! haha.

Coinbase really is impressing me.  I gotta say, the community really needs to stand behind them a little more, despite the fact that they centralize keys and take a way a lot of the core values of bitcoin from the average user, they are a bitcoin company that besides lackluster support in their early days, has really turned around and are being run correctly.  I love it.

I wouldn't say killed it, but if you are a new miner and mining at GHASH.IO or BTCGuild, I would encourage a switch to Slush, Bitminter, P2Pool or even Eligius.  Once a pool starts flirting with 15% of the network, I grow weary of it.  I really hope that more people see the benefit in mining at pools with ~5% of the network.  If the BTC price goes way up in its fiat conversion value, you are going to see pool operators get really competitive to get 1-2% of that block reward, but as of now that amount is not a huge incentive for people who only have a couple percentage points of the network.  Someone like Slush (who takes 2%) gets a whopping .1 BTC a day, or 3 BTC a month.  This just isn't a lot by today's exchange rate. You start flirting with a 1-2k bitcoin and that 3 BTC sounds a whole lot sexier then...
