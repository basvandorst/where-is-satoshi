A app people use to trade options. You can buy bitcoin on it but you don’t actually physically own any bitcoin.

Electrum. You can download right from their website which is electrum.org and it will install easily. You want the standalone executable. From there just make a wallet. I would recommend a non segwit wallet with a password. Right down your special words and save them somewhere, and bam there you go. If you have any other questions feel free to message me.

You don’t have control of the coin if it is on coinbase, technically they have possession of your bitcoin. If you have your own wallet that coin is going nowhere no matter what unless you want it to go somewhere. It’s a safety thing. The bitcoin is physically in your possession at that point. 
For instance, if coinbase suddenly disappeared for whatever reason and your coin was on there, your coin would be gone. If you have it in your own wallet, it doesn’t matter, you still have it.

Yes u/doctorblumpkin it is similar, but coin base has even less functionality as you cannot trade stocks there like you can on robinhood.

You can absolutely use it to purchase bitcoin but if you want to sit on it I would move to your own wallet, I recommend electrum

You should really rethink your strategy here, it’s all wrong. 
Thinking you know when the next ATH will be is honestly laughable man... this market is so heavily manipulated that the peaks and valleys are simply dictated by whales making market moves. 
Your ignorance is truly next level. 
Fucking Robinhood... wow
