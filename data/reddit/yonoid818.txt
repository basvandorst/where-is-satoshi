Why do burn addresses exist?

Why would they be lining up at an ATM to withdraw 5 cents? Am I missing something?

I'm still waiting on a $25K wire I made on November 21. I've had it take a couple weeks before but it came through eventually.

Why isn't there a nonprofit organization devoted to running full nodes? (One that would be under heavy scrutiny and audit of course.)

The song that never ends: $1000 of Bitcoin on the wall, $1000 of Bitcoin, take $100 down, spend it around...uh...$1200 of Bitcoin on the wall!

I'm planning on waiting at least 7 years and at least $350K.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:45:11
About $350K per coin would be market cap of gold. So as a mainstream store of value (not as an everyday currency), that might be a good benchmark.

Why are there some people still buying this? Is it out of possibility that the fork will still happen?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:35:58
Yes, Wells Fargo put a halt on them.

From April 20 to April 24, USDT fell to 85 cents. During that same time, BTC's price was flat and unreactive.

Use Ledger Manager (Google Extension) to download the BTG app. Once you select the BTG wallet on your device, click on BTG split tool on the bottom when it asks whether you want to access legacy or segwit addresses.

Louisiana has low electricity costs. One of the best states for mining.

I switched from Electrum to Ledger Nano S this summer. They split out my Bitcoin Gold for me so I was able to dump those today. Hardware wallets are more secure because your private keys aren't in contact with the internet or on your computer. They also have a much nicer user interface than electrum imo.

Exact same thing happened to me. Luckily they made my funds available for withdraw eventually (took maybe a week or two). Just don't close the account.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:43:22
I bought a Trezor and I couldn't get it to work at all. I bought a Nano S and it has worked very nicely for me. Intuitive user interface as well.

Speculation is that this guy is cashing out within the currently collapsing ponzi scheme and is staging this as a way to avoid taxes.

Exactly what I'm waiting for.

HitBTC is the quickest and has the most liquidity for BTG.

Tom is one of my favorite people. It's a shame that he hasn't kept himself informed enough to know that Roger Ver is one of the worst voices he could be listening to on the subject of Bitcoin.

Make sure you clicked on BTG split tool before selecting legacy or segwit, otherwise it won't show any coins. You will need to access the coins with whichever private key you had your BTC stored on at the time of the fork (which I think was October 20-something).

You had a premonition about BTC switching denominations to bits.

Papa Bless.

I agree. I'd never heard of Jamie Dimon before he said something about Bitcoin. His comments also had nothing to do with the recent China-ban dip.

But the only time I've ever searched for the full moon is when I'm looking for my next Byteball payout, so...
