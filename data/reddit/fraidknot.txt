They want the bitcoin name because they want the bitcoin brand. The argument is that "bitcoin core" "forked" away from the true intention of what bitcoin is supposed to be and that bitcoin cash "is the real bitcoin." It's hard for that argument to make any sense to the uninformed when you're trying to say "bcash is the real bitcoin."

That's a great point but I bet he would have if he could have. His argument is that insider trading is a wonderful metric for figuring out the internal problems of giant companies. It gives whistle blowers incentive to blow the whistle since they can profit off of it. Of course it's easy to abuse so the current consensus is to make it illegal.

The idea is that when you're a bitcoin millionaire bitcoin will be so ubiquitous that you'll receive wages in bitcoin and nearly everyone will accept it as a form of payment.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:05:06
Why would wages be paid in some other alt? Why would Bitcoin be hoarded after everyone has some and the price stabilizes? At that point main chain transactions will be rare and most transaction will occur on 2nd or 3rd level structures which would severely limit any "faster transaction" argument regarding alts.

You never argued what? You said there's no way Coinbase is FDIC insured and then you said only USD is insured at Coinbase. That's what FDIC insurance is, it's protection for USD held in banks.

Perhaps you meant your original argument to say that FDIC insurance doesn't subject Coinbase to insider trading laws?

@_date: 2017-11-11 17:54:38
So, just to be clear, what you're saying is that once we reach 2MB blocks we won't need to increase them ever again?
*:edit:* Just to add, I'm not saying not to increase block size. Nobody here is against increasing block size. The point is to take advantage of off-chain scaling before increasing the block size in order to slow the data requirements from getting to "data center" levels. Ideally, with off-chain solutions in place, transfer speeds and disk space costs will go down at a rate faster than the increasing needs of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:20:53
So, 50 people having a combined worth of almost $2 trillion isn't ridiculous to you? 
Even if you only used Coinbase's (growing larger every day) 12.5 million users as a metric, they would only have to hold $160,000 worth of bitcoin each to reach $2 trillion. 
It seems to me that you don't actually really want to know how bitcoin might reach trillions in market cap, you just want to criticize something that you don't understand yet. That's fine, new things are hard to understand sometimes.

Humans have a tendency to use up all resources available to them. Without off-chain scaling measures 2MB blocks soon become 4, become 8, 16, 32, 64. Now the chain is growing by 10GB per day. Pretty soon only large data centers can manage that kind of requirement. Centralized.

This is a very difficult thing to argue against because of the seriousness of the content. Hard forking or chain scrubbing are not trivial tasks, especially not in a market that routinely transacts more than $6bn daily.
While it may be true that a way to access CP is stored on the blockchain, I doubt more than a handful of individuals are aware of the process in which to find and decode that information. In this case, I think the offence is caused by those who are distributing the means to find and decode that information in the blockchain.
The very best analogy I can come up with is suppose that someone says that they steganographically encoded CP in the Windows source code but lost the means to find and decrypt it. This becomes big news and everyone who uses Windows is now knowingly in possession of CP. The only way to stop this from being the case is to rewrite Windows from the ground up to replace every existing copy ever.

It's really not a difficult leap of the imagination to come up with a scenario in which someone might use the threat of violence to coerce you into giving them access to your private key, no matter how it's secured. I'll give you a hint, they don't have to threaten to inflict the violence upon you. And thus, "your coins are now only secured by your anonymity and pain tolerance." Pain tolerance being physical, mental, emotional, or otherwise.
Given that your argument was based on the inability to formulate such a scenario on your own and my criticism of your intelligence was based on that (and not, for instance, which subreddits you frequent), I don't think my tasteless yet cathartic insult qualifies as either an argument nor ad hominem logical fallacy.

I think it can be argued that the blockchain backs the value of crypto. Every past transaction protects future transactions.

I think it's divisible by 100 million making there be a maximum of 2,100,000,000,000,000 Satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) Bitcoin has always been divisible like that. It was never intended to only be used in full units so that doesn't really change the scarcity.
I think probably most of the promises you think it hasn't delivered on are purely because it hasn't been widely adopted yet. Think of how long it probably took personal checks to catch on. Even after checks were widely accepted you'd still frequently find stores who weren't willing to accept them as payment.
As for whether or not Bitcoin will survive long term, [it's already survived a number of "deaths."]( I personally think all of the forks and unrelated altcoins are a good thing. It shows the technology is evolving and improving. Every new thing that gets tried and works well for an alt can be implemented into the core structure of Bitcoin. Sometimes that might take awhile, that's a good thing too. Stability is nice, and fundamental changes should be well vetted before being implemented, especially when it comes to something that's intended to be a currency. 
For the record, I am by no means an expert on any of this. I've only been involved from about May of this year. I read a little and watch a few videos here and there to try to wrap my head around things, but that's about it. My opinions here are based on that limited understanding and I expect them to change as I learn more about this stuff.

Cash out to what, cash? Because your bank's cryptography will be broken too. I'm no expert, yet, but I imagine there are ways to make things cryptographically secure even in a post-quantum computing world.

Right now, and especially in the context of the OP, I think of it in terms of opportunity cost. Right now the opportunity cost of a good or service that I want but don't need is much higher than that of buying bitcoin. Since it's likely I would have spent and not saved that money anyway, I'm only buying bitcoin that I can afford to lose. If bitcoin (or some other crypto) never gets to that point it'll be no different than pissing out the beer I would have drank instead, as an example. The hangover might be worse though...

I haven't been in bitcoin long, but as soon as I saw that he only logs in to his wallet with the mnemonic phrase, I was pretty confident that he could do absolutely nothing and have nothing to worry about. Hell, he could unlock his phone for the thief and point out his wallet and not have anything to worry about, besides threat of physical harm.

Was your question not asked in relation to the bitcoin measure in USD argument? You asked for a number, so I assumed it was.
I think a lot of HODLers are not looking at the value of BTC in terms of fiat, but in terms of the future utility and practicality of using it as a sole form of value transfer. The day that I get paid wages in BTC and can use BTC as ubiquitously as I use my debit card is the day that I stop HODLing.

What you just said was "He says bitcoin is a fraud, he is a fraudster, a fraudster would know what a fraud was, therefore bitcoin is a fraud." I don't think that's what you meant to say.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:27:50
I don't even know if that's possible at this stage. The best indicator we have is how it trades with various forms of fiat since that's what most people are familiar with. When you consider how scarce bitcoin is and that it will only continue to get more scarce because of lost wallets and whatnot you have to expect that it's current value is incredibly underrepresented. There won't even be enough for every current millionaire in the world to own an entire bitcoin.

Sure, but if the concern is quantum computers breaking cryptography, even your mostly digital fiat is going to be useless. Am I going to file a tenth of a gram off my gold bar to buy a coffee? Assuming there is no way to secure network encryption against quantum computers, the world impact is going to be much much larger than worrying about cashing out one's bitcoin.
I guess my point is that there's really no reason for the average person to actually worry about quantum computing in this context. It's like worrying about an asteroid wiping out all life on Earth. There's not much you as an individual can do about it
