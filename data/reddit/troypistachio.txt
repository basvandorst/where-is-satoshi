you should probably set that reminder for 11 months or so.....

Your uncle is either being scammed himself or trying to scam you.

That message was from the an account that was  shortly afterwards revealed to be compromised. It is highly unlikely that this was actually Satoshi. Satoshi isn't coming back.
Edit: We also already know that originally there was no block size limit. The 1mb cap was put in place as a temporary anti-spam mechanism. 
Edit2: you can keep downvoting me, but everything I said here is true.

I haven't used cryptsy since 2013, but that seems to be the current best strategy.

This has been suggested countless times and will never happen.

I'd imagine that if you could, the price difference would even out pretty quick, I think the answer is no.

Search this sub for the word ["cryptsy"](

Payments sent as friends and family can also be reversed if the person claims the use of their account was unauthorized.

This seems like a problem with whatever service you used, really not much anyone in can do for you. You might be able to contact the company that issued the gift card and try to find out the specifics of the transaction, which you then could provide to the escrow service. If you can't provide any proof though, you're probably screwed.

This is not the first Halving.

It was not clear from your initial post that you understood this.
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:11:43
I love this idea, but I'm not sure it will get much traction. I remember the days when LambdaMOO was cutting edge tech.
