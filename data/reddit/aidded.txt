They've sent 12 Bitcoins, what wallet are you using and what's your address?

Feel bad for all the people giving up GoxBTC for cheap, but i HIGHLY doubt you got 14,000miliBtc for just 690miliBtc...

Or just the open source one, firefox. Why the hell did they ever put it on proprietary chrome?!

$255 to $60(ish) is not 90%.

Yeh, she's loving her son. The bitcoin community seems to find it really difficult to understand this concept, love is like, being nice to people. Helping people. Not calling for them to kill themselves, especially with no evidence...
Parental love is unconditional...

Wait... I didn't think of that before...
But Mt Gox wouldn't lose their bitcoin keys! That's ridciculues, they're alright, they're cool...
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:35:26
Of course, i would support Gox's users, as what helps Gox, helps the users.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:10:54
Bitcoiners are apparently evil bastards. Not one comment along the lines of "joke too far" or "killing people is wrong"

It's in JSON format, it shouldn't be too hard to write a script to do it :)

I'm in support of net neutrality and I'd expect the community (probably) is. It won't affect bitcoin unless they *really* go far with their meddling (which hopefully they won't). 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:18:15
:'( bad day for bitcoin
We took the risk, and we lost. But hey, i'm 16, I've got my life ahead of me, 10 years time we'll be laughing our heads off.
Was worth the risk though, we would of got BEEF returns if it had paid off!
Don't worry about it mate! It could be worse, you could be on fire.

Don't follow my advice, I'm an idiot. But I'm buying gox bitcoins cheap over at bitcoin builder as I'm pretty certain gox will solve their problems eventually.
I bought 332 millibits in gox for 125 millibitsd out of gox. Please, as I said I'm a novice, do your own reaserch, you don't want to lose money (I don't want you to either)
Redditers take no responsibility...

"Saving poor farmers in Africa" Is what makes Andreas great. He doesn't care about the wealth of VC's or regulation, he cares about the 90%...

V.little UK bitcoin exchange competición = V.high price

They'll probably 'confirm' the transactions in about ~40 or so minuets, after then you'll be able to spend them and move them from coinbase, they should be showing up by then.

For card transactions yes, but if my customer wants to pay for some €0.60 chips, €0.09 transaction fee is 17%! Cash is so much cheaper for small RealLife transactions. "BitCoin is great for micropayments" , "With BitCoin there are no transaction fees" lol, such lies
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:30:48
Not really, if you don't pay them you can't actually use bitcoin?
It's simmilar to Tax really. Tax is technically voluntary, just if you don't pay it, the system doesn't work for you.
