Thanks for the reply. I am also PR, but I am not sure how they would know that unless you gave them your ID.  Kraken has the same procedures, but even more strict.  In order to gain higher security tiers, you have to take a photo of your face next to the ID.

This would be great if banks automatically add exchange accounts.  I looked into localbitcoins in Japan, but the rates were just terrible.  I didn't check in the US, which probably would have been better, but I wanted to do it as close to the exchange rate as I could get.  So, maybe that cost me some time.

If I go to coinbase.com and click on "buy" it says, 
"Sorry! Buy &amp; Sell not available in Japan
We are not able to provide exchanging bitcoin in your region yet. Consider contacting your local government. Learn More &gt;"
So, you must be doing something different.  Perhaps you set it up while in the US?  Or maybe you are on military base, using a US IP?  I know there is a VPN I can use in Korea which is a virtual US IP.  I am not sure.
It is also possible that the security with BTCbox changed.  Obviously, I cannot speak to your personal experience, but I did this just a month ago. 日本円の入出金は本人認証が必要になります
If I wanted to deposit or withdraw with Japanese yen, I needed to photo my ID and send it to them.

lol. I could be wrong in my estimate.  It really is hard for me to measure since I did it over such a long period, and a little here and there.

well, it probably wasn't that much time.  I honestly cannot say the number of hours.  I think it wasn't that much.  I spent like a month on it or so, but I didn't work on it every day, and I only spent like an hour or two a day.  So, I figure in total, a very bad estimate might say it was close to 24 hours of actual reading/research, and doing stuff (mostly screwing it up and redoing it).
