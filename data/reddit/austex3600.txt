What happens if ₿ hits $1000 and amazon only gives you one item for 1btc instead of ten items for 1btc ? Would feel like you got less there
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:55:32
Start a business doing this FOR other people and charge ₿ fees 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:00:53
What kind of prediction is that 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:25:45
Would your money feel like cheaper and cheaper coins though if it took 10 to buy what 1 used to? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:06:50
steady growth graph alignment does not determine bitcoin price tho
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:42:42
Government spits out so many luxuries you take for granted and you still bash them . Should be happy they’re on board. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:27:11
I’d rather pay a miner a fee then let the bank know where the moneys going 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:06:29
Need to start spending bitcoins on regular stuff instead of using your dollars ! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:55:23
Get your CPU to help mine the backlog of TX and maybe fees will go down. ???
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:52:43
You need to step up and MAKE the meme

Just get a second wallet and if you guys want to compare your btc buys and earning/losses it’s easy. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:00:49
I shall post the next one in 15 minutes 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:51:28
If electronics shit the bed globally and you SAVED your ₿ you’d still have an issue with other people no longer being able to use it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:16:36
Ya this is a lot of people bandwagoning, awkwardly buying while others panic sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:22:27
This stats really don’t do any justice .. the top 100 wallets probably have an insane number of the btc and the bottom 100,000 wallets probably are just there 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:49:47
Nobody said anything about police stopping crime. I’m saying it’s a fact that street lights lower crime . Who set those up for you and keeps them on outside your house ? That’s right ! Retarded government . 
Do you live in the states ? 
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:26:43
It’s a good indicator that 1M followers here isn’t as substantial as 1M enthusiastic followers somewhere else 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:44:52
Do you benefit from street lights ? That stop your town from being a crime filled ghetto ? It’s one example . But if you’re already on the LOLOL brainwashing Pagé it might be too late for you 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:10:16
Profit if you sell* . It’s only worth what it’s worth when you use it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:04:16
Why not ? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:05:17
Yo what about this : 
$1 in electricity mining = $5 in bitcoin (let’s pretend) 
But a bank can use $1 of electricity to complete millions of dollars in transactions. The ₿ miner will always be slow and tedious 
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:24:20
Best rates ? Are there companies charging higher rates and profiting ? If I put $2000 into exchange , how many bitcoins will i be capable of getting ? 
On the flip side , can I go the other way? Easily sell my coins back and have them be (fairly close to) $2000?
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:25:56
Spend $400 
Profit $15/month (after power consumption) 
Wait 30 months , begin earning $15/month for free . 
Free Spotify in 2 years bro. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:17:20
It really is anybody’s guess where bitcoin and mining will be in 5 years. I don’t see a cpu not being able to mine $400 in ₿ in its lifetime.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:54:12
Hey if you didn’t know , Reddit recently added the option to take off targeted ads. You’ll see regular ads but they’ll make less sense to you. -&gt; less inclined to purchase -&gt; ad spammers lose ! :).
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:42:17
Tbh I hear so many people losing track of their wallets (could be $50,000 easily) and noooooovody will help you 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:32:50
Accelerating at rate X initially and finally accelerating at &gt;rate X
Means you have let off the gas. Or applied brake. They are the same . 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:07:46
Fair enough. Implying that purchasing stuff with BTC will dodge these bank fees but apply the BTC transaction fees. When BTC is everywhere will items effectively be priced the same ? Will foreign purchases from Amazon and stuff be cheaper because no banks are involved ? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:39:18
have you ever driven a car in your life?
Get up to speed 
Put your feet on the dashboard 
Watch your speed fall. No feet on the brake. No feet on the gas. Speed will fall. 
Also you can cancel out positive GAS by negative BRAKE simultaneously . By providing less +GAS it is the same function as providing more -BRAKE . 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:35:45
Why? What is so repulsive about his suggestion ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:26:24
Question for you: 
My BTC goes down slightly every time I send money due to transaction fees. I assume this pools and the mining collects it. The fees seemed almost like a tax, but on money I've already paid tax on. How can I use bitcoin effectively without losing my BTC to fees and exchange rates ?
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:27:09
You can spend your money on heroine or crack cocaine *if you wish*. The problem is that people’s “free will” gets people into trouble. Then other people have to support the people who go under . 
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:00:01
Also obtaining any information from a party that says “I don’t have any crypto” would be rough. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 06:00:10
Useful information : people ruin their lives gambling their money away at bad odds. Don’t do this to people. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:45:41
Gambling and investing are two different things that share similarities. Investing in a stock is a gamble but doesn’t mean your government is going to regulate it as gambling . 
Gambling regulations are in place cause people will just throw their life away if they’re allowed 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:50:18
.... it doesn’t work like that. The reason you are able to buy food or have pizza delivered is from these roads too. Criminals are kept at bay by the police . Fires aren’t leveling city blocks because of tax paid fire fighters. Teachers that gave you your education are tax paid. They probably even used roads to get to their job. 
This is why you as an individual can’t opt out . It’s because you’re already so deep into it. You do and always will use tax paid things. 
Hell, even the internet you use to fiddle with bitcoin has been constructed and kept online by taxes . Maybe it’s indiviudual companies that do the work but guess who’s roads they use to *reliably* reach the infastructure that needs repair ? Everything man.. evvvverytning survives off taxes 
@_date: 2018-11-30 06:30:36
I’m pretty damn sure this is a made up number . Every kid at home with a graphics card is mining bitcoin on *fossil fuel powered grids* and you’re going to tell me we’ve magically isolated our miners to places powered by renewables ? 
Not a chance. This is just bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 05:44:50
Fucking glorious 
@_date: 2018-03-19 06:19:27
Same question holds for every currency in exsistence ! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:19:11
where I live we pay tax and we have things supplied by govt.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:42:18
Then so be it. Except that the mafia doesn’t literally buy machines to repair roads *in front of your house* and then install, maintain, and pay for a nice big lamp next to your house as well and needless to say this is *everywhere you go* that has a good government. Why??! Taxes ! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:31:10
Honestly , if you use government or municipal infastructure on the daily, you should be paying taxes out of the goodness of your heart when you earn lots of money, not shy away and hope somebody else is honest and pays . 
Roads ? Streetlights ? Garbage pickup ? All very useful and free! Make sure you pitch in! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:27:49
Ya if you go from 
200 to 20,000 then back to 220, it’s really scary to state it as “grew from 200 to 220 this week” because the peak is important from an information POV 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:36:57
Legal consequences ? Sounds like that’d be rough to attempt to persue
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:13:49
The CITIZENS as taxpayers are the ones paying for the roads and lamps they utilize. It’s a collective effort. If taxes were voluntary we wouldn’t pay them and then we would complain about our shit roads. Good thing we are forced to pay ? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:36:49
Ya until then it’s -33 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:22:22
Actually , with enough enforcement they can and will steal your money. Just like with my Pool you could totally forbid me and try to throw me in jail but you’re going to need some serious force to get me there which you don’t have .
Our government will literally arrest and jail you if you don’t pay your taxes . Not just “you have to it’s the rule” but they’ll physically back it up if they must. They’re saying “get in line or we will put you there” 
Yeah, it’s rough . But it’s better for everybody to crowd fund everything we need instead of individually hoarding our resources. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 07:51:06
The problem isn’t with people being forced to gamble or unable to stop . It’s that people are bad at controlling themselves and inadvertendtly run them self into the ground . The gambler doesn’t really care what the true odds are so they can be manipulated by the system especially with computers .

So invest 30,000 from now till 2023 to become millionaire ?

Ya no people pay off bills at random times, often “one month after you set it up.”
