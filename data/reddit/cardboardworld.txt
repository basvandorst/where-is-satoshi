If it were anything like a mania, there wouldn't be "experts" everywhere talking about how much of a bubble it is.

Money is finite... *arbitrarily creates more*
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:31:30
It would be losses in this case but I understand your point.

I love bitcoin but don’t plan on using ATMs with it. Sounds like you’ve experienced a real flaw.
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:54:04
Facebook won’t control Libra. It is a partnership between many different parties. There would have to be agreement between them. 
Do you know what arbitrage is? It’s not going to happen.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:23:50
I strongly disagree and think it would be a horrible PR move to do this.
@_date: 2019-07-14 03:37:01
Maybe go back to how you started the article by calling bitcoin money at the end.
@_date: 2019-07-30 01:38:05
There are wallets that keep track.

Where is the edge of the earth? I want to bungee jump there

It is still being established how people will use bitcoin. It reminds me of the internet when it was a big deal to download a picture. I have complete confidence in bitcoin’s potential, but don’t believe banks will go away completely. They will eventually adapt.

When I invested in Apple in 2003 people made arguments with me that felt very similar to this article. I love the guy trying to downplay an 11-fold increase. These people think 7% is a good gain.

Emphasis on basic...

It's not short selling if you have to buy the shares first. Have you ever shorted a stock before?
@_date: 2019-07-31 01:21:04
If it fits, it ships!

"good technical analysis"
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:01:55
I've shorted stocks. You don't "borrow" shares.

Imagine loving money
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:27
I'm sorry. I assumed you were talking about me because I saw I had been downvoted. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:50:24
Ok. I guess I just wouldn't describe short selling as borrowing shares and selling them to someone who doesn't know what it means.

Would just like to point out that Apple stopped being a "laughing stock" years before the announcement of the iPhone. Every new MP3 player was the "iPod killer".

Whether or not people are rushing to put their 401k's into something isn't an indication that something is a good investment. Congratulations, you're able to invest in something that is unlikely to ever provide serious returns and won't go to zero. Why are you even here?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:17:57

Someone should tell the author that bitcoin is capped at 21 million...
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:16:53
If you're that certain it's going to drop by 50% why would you buy it beforehand?
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:28:47
Make your time gentlemen!
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:10:01
There will be a point where people will either be satisfied with the exchange rate and spend or need to make purchases. I don't see deflation (at least with Bitcoin) as a negative. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:03:47
I thought the ad was memorable and got across what it wanted to. People who say they needed to include more information or explain bitcoin probably don't understand why advertising is effective.
@_date: 2014-12-31 03:31:44
There is actually an article called "the rise and fall of bitcoin" made in 2011. People can be critical, especially towards new ideas.
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:06:33
I think the ads overall are good because they promote bitcoin as a solution for legitimate businesses.
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:02:04
I don't see how a 1% fee to buy bitcoin is anything at all like taking the nutrients away from potatoes and making them unhealthy.

I wish the arguments about the definition of inflation would stop. :(
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:26:13
I thought about buying more at 170, but then I realized I didn't want to put more money into a rapidly declining asset/currency at this time.
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:00:01
You had me thinking we were sub 200 again...
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:33:19
Next time have a plan before you spend the money.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:31:48
I'm actually looking forward to some buying opportunities.
@_date: 2016-01-31 06:01:33
I think it will be a lot sooner than within ten years. That seems conservative. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 08:55:01
Could you explain to me your thinking here? (Genuinely curious)
@_date: 2016-11-08 09:32:19
Seems like an advertisement for Ether to me. (Comparing it directly to bitcoin and making it the only alternative). 
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:37:27
Wow thank you for your response. I knew some of that but you really clarified it for me. 
@_date: 2019-10-08 20:29:31
This is not the most clever joke I’ve heard.
@_date: 2019-08-18 00:22:22
Can you imagine having shorted this currency in the past? Yowza!
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:50:43
They need to see more examples of “normal” people using it and recommending it.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:30:12
There is supply and demand outside of Coinbase and miner rewards.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:45:54
This is the same thinking that fuels demand for penny stocks.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:56:20
For the record, inflation to grocery store prices is not a one-to-one ratio. I’m sure the manufacturers know a lot about the price elasticity of their products and act accordingly.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:29:51
Sounds like you bought at a time of a lot of hype and you no longer want to hold because there is less hype.
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:51:58
One thing that this chart seems to omit is that you can invest in very small amounts of bitcoin and still benefit from the price gains.
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:17:04
You really think that because people can pay their AT&amp;T bill with bitcoin that they’ll suddenly start using it? The people here give importance to merchant adoption because it is one of the few things that can be quantified in a way that suggests more adoption. I don’t care if everyone else said something different.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:01:41
I have a feeling bitcoin’s software alone could circumvent any ban. Also, it’s a global currency and is not attached to any specific country or government. If they tried to confiscate coins they would have to do some serious implementing of their own software.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:21:28
It’s different when it’s actually happening to you. Anyone can say they know what they’d do under specific circumstances.

Fun fact: eBay giftcards can be bought through an app using bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:45:54
Spending bitcoins at merchants is arguably not important at all for adoption. Being able to spend it is not a priority for people who get it. 
I used the gyft app and was able to get gift cards with Bitcoin very easily and at good retailers, with none of them directly accepting bitcoin. I think the spending solution will be something like this
