Cool way to promote. Your sound reminds me of the 90's "Clawfinger" somehow, which is a good thing :)

Bitstamp. Only one so far this authorize me, and it's been very stable for me.

Segwit support and their site is stable, even during the runs.

How come? Is litecoin harder, or can you not use the GPU for it?

Someone stealing the phone :P

Thanks, that certainly makes sense :)

I believe it's a technology, per definition, more than a currency. And technologies are usually capitalized :)

I'd love to try! :) 15kmvu3fsfZ8mNirUhHb8saiKT2FjRtyYa

I love that it's gotten this easy to send money back and forth. I think you'll at least be giving away the 2 Bitcents for a home theater system within this year. Fascinating stuff.

Just announced today (in my own company) that we're up for implementing Bitcoin payment on our customers webshops. Looking forward to helping it spread!
