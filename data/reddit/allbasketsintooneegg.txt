How do you update that app? I installed the Ledger App in Google Chrome and I can only see the wallet functionality.
EDIT: Installed the wrong app.
EDIT2: It is working fine now after updating the Bitcoin app with the 'Ledger Manager’.

Are you able to send funds?

Thanks, the default derivation is working but when I enter m/49'/0'/0' the setup will quit with 'Cannot read xpub from device'.

I am using macOS and a Ledger Nano S.

Your method doesn't work and another cable isn't helping either.
In the command line I can see that an exception is raised:
    /electrum_plugins/ledger/ledger.py line 66
    Exception: Firmware version too old for Segwit support. Please update at 
I am already running the most recent firmware.
self.supports_segwit is returning 'false' while it should return 'true'.

How do you create a segwit wallet using a hardware wallet?
When you select 'Create a new seed' it asks you about segwit but when select 'Use a hardware device' this option is not available.

Yes, it is working fine then.
I just can't edit it permanently because the scripts are extracted out of the binary every time you run the Electrum App on macOS. (And I don't want to install homebrew because it caused problems on my system and it wasn't easy to remove again.)
I hope this is getting fixed in the release. I should open an issue on github.
