That’s a lot of money

What about the rain, pressure and stresses that would be exerted on the hard drive? Do you feel as though it would have survived?

*we can create money*
Those are 4 words that just shouldn’t exist together in today’s world.

Ideally both keep the same value but one/both should rapidly fall as in Cash’s case - after that who knows?

If there’s no clear winner, chances are the price will be split between them. Otherwise a bubble market is created

Like the guy who threw away 7000 Bitcoin :/

There are a number of tricks/ciphers you could utilise to prevent this. If someone wants to escape so badly, they will put the effort into learning 12 words, or failing that, find a smart way to conceal them/cipher them.

Remembering 12 words is as good easy as creating a story that involves them.

I’m low on money, I can’t add 0.5BTC to your portfolio again - please, I’ve already sent you 6BTC :(

It’s a heck of a lot easier concealing a note with 12 words than concealing metal.

In that world, the rising pressure of Bitcoin and Ethereum has forced governments worldwide to issue a new currencies, with features that allow for taxation, inflation and reserves. The US has created USDX, the next generation of the dollar - they issue a set amount for parity with the existing dollar value, with opportunity for variable inflation depending on adoption. Banks are advised to begin shifting their value from cash to USDX, whilst proof of stake fees provide an incentive for them to do so. Banks issue new payment cards, that link effortlessly to USDX, for a time USDX lacks stability - so most purchases are performed in the existing USD value, slowly however, the population becomes aware of how much USDX they own and prices begin to effortlessly switch as less and less people pay in cash.
Smaller nations begin to adopt USDX, as their own currencies have been overinflated - this cryptocurrency was on track to become the world’s greatest store of value. Vitalik Buterin helps Russia develop their own cryptocurrency, Europe builds their own based on the Euro, whilst companies such as Square, PayPal and even Apple distribute their own proprietary worldwide currencies with massive legal backlash from the government.
It’s a bloodbath for many years with intense volatility almost dwarfing financial collapses of the past - but it had to be done, as the government could not allow Bitcoin to take over completely, whilst being completely unregulated.
