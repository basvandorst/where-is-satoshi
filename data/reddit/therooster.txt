are you saying that bch is a usable, transferable currency and btc is not?  don't be a hater, bro.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:08:14
haha that's so unbelievable.  everyone knows that homeless shelters only take women and children and this cartoon duck looks like a man.

He's the richest prisoner in the world!
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:44:54
do you also want to sue bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, and all the other forks or do you just feel threatened by cash?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:44:41
Thanks BTC.  Now how the fuck am I supposed to get any work done today!
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:31:30
not liekly. i'd bet they go with something anti trump.  maybe the illegals.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:50:13
haha.  Once BTC+ all the BTC forks equal a combined total of $178,260,869 per coin, the US can pay off the $20.5T in debt with the 115,000 BTC the FBI confiscated.

This is exactly why I hate IOTA

There was a chance your down payment could have turned into a free house next year.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:42:01
$12k... I remember that like it was this morning.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:14:56
Kraken reps told me that Tier 4 for Americans = $100k/year even though their web site states otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:15:12
i'm not in the ultra category but my bank pulled them same shit with me and I told them I prefer bitcoin and closed out my accounts with them.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:53:08
this is retarded.  most fiat has been digital for years.  this guy is just pulling out all the stops to delay the total destruction of his country by his forced socialism.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:22:04
If breaking $20k will be like when we broke $10k then you ought to get in now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:58:12
Yeah, it looks like I'm going to be out a some mBTC on this.  Just proves that you need to keep your coins offline and never move them to a third party wallet unless you have to trade and then get them out asap.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:40:29
haha.  dumbass thinks he's unique.  we all wish we bought at $300 and we all wish we bought more at $10k.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:53:48
I'm thinking about getting into the bitcoin atm business.  anyone have an idea how to go about it?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:28:04
$13k in Korea.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:12:13
That happened to me except it was my bank doing it.  So I switched banks and continued buying even harder.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:28:10
$12k is great but the real milestone is $12.5K then 25k, 50, 100
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:59:26
$1300 is a reasonable fee?  WTF are you smoking?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:34:58
But don't we tell everyone how much BTC we have every time we make a transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:07:29
No. Tesla is a shitcar.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:42:17
I dunno but we were under $12k earlier THIS WEEK so there's gonna be a dip here.  Just unavoidable.

SBI is heavily involved in XRP
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:13:14
AFAIK, no one owns the name so bitcoin is whatever the market chooses it to be.  You wanna beat cash?  make a better bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:55:59
sell a shitcoin that's going down to buy a shitcoin that's going up only to see things reverse and find that you totally fucked yourself.  er, I mean, so I hear.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:04:27
But I was told that socialism works...
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:42:56
Looks like shit ton of market orders flowing, mostly on the sell side.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:18:51
I was thinking $15k EOY after we broke $10k and now I don't know what to think.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:16:12
dude is jealous and now hates you. it's just that simple.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:37:04
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:27:33
haha.  I did the same fucking thing.  I downloaded some bitcoin wallet that had a button that read "mine bitcoin."  I pushed it and after a couple hours when I didn't get anything, I wondered if it was really working so I turned it off and forgot about it.
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:03:07
Totally.  Last time I was in a taxi I asked the taxi driver if he had heard of US dollars.  Turns out he had.  Sell USD.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:41:43
what does that mean?  I've bought from bitstamp and can withdraw no problem.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:23:24
just dipped from 3725 to 3675.  jump in!
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:25:32
Every dem politician I've heard may think differently but they all act the same.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:35:56
no, that isn't how it works.  there's a seller for every buyer.  the price goes up when sellers raise their asking prices.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:52:42
HAHA.  Some idiot placed a market order on kraken and got filled at 4149.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:20:14
I was told there would be a dip.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:26:23
I bought both!  Getting killed on the bch but making it all up and more on the btc
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:27:47
Is the dip over?  I want some more at 2500.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:04:22
If your timing is right then you can make some money but in this environment, it is better just to buy the coin.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:10:04
3700 bitches.  This shit going to be $4,000 tomorrow morning?
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:17:46
weekends too?
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:34:52
It's different this time!!
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:00:21
My wife called me crazy when I bought more at 3550 on Friday.
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:33:29
If Bitcoin ETF are approved then the sky is the limit.  It is so easy to put $100k or $1m into an ETF since people already have a brokerage account with cash or stocks vs. opening a bitcoin exchange account, waiting a couple months to get verified, deal with low deposit and withdrawal limits, wiring money from your bank, worrying about the exchange getting hacked or losing your wallet passwords, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:56:05
Dude, you paid nearly $4k/coin!
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:42:51
just wait until you load the drive and find out theyre all buttcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:55:29
Good job for not listening to her.  My wife talked me out of it when I wanted to buy in the 250-750 range.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:15:48
Personally, I think everyone here is too damn excited.  We're going to get a correction here.  It's just a matter of when. (Also I want to buy some fucking more at a lower price!!)
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:03:17
my farts are rare.  I'll sell you one for 1 mBTC.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:31:12
Well if this is true then BCH serves no purpose.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:47:09
I hate Kraken.  Their web site sucks.  Their support response time is slow.  And they offer a limited number of coins.
But I still use them because they are one of the few firms that'll take USD deposits.
Anyone have some recommendations for firms taking USD deposits?  not coinbase - I refuse to link them to my bank account.
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:22:26
A great idea to attract foreign buyers who suffer from capital outflow controls and aren't allowed to wire huge amounts of money outside their country.

Slap a bitcoin symbol over his head and we got a new meme on our hands.

@_date: 2017-08-11 23:21:12
is it doggy coin?
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:54:30
Likely they would hold it to back their currency much like they do with gold or US treasuries.
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:27:26
It is to me.  The big fear in the back of my mind is that countries will make crypto illegal.  Now we are seeing actual countries getting into the game so that worry is waning.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:23:03
dood.  you sound just like my wife!
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:01:00
Yeah, pretty dumb to buy coffee with btc.  Pizza on the other hand...
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:50:34
All my BTC is registered in my dog's wallet.  I don't own anything personally.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:30:07
All of them. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:35:34
Hopefully, we can get back to the 5500 area.  I don't know if I can handle paying 7200 for one btc.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:06:07
Btc is at 7300 bch is at 660,  b2x futures are at 2000, and btg futures are at 100.  We already hit 10000 baby.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:50:50
$100M is only ~10,000 bitcoins right now.  Shouldn't be too difficult to spread that out over 5 different exchanges and buy in.  GDAX alone has done volume of 60,000 or so coins in the past 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:50:14
Unlikely. Most new users are signing up through coinbase and they don't make a market in bch.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:58:17
If we get anywhere close to that price next year I am totally cashing out and even if it runs to $1m, i'm fine with that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:53:05
Well when 1 BTC = $1m USd, you'll be able to buy that 1/5 of an iphone you always wanted.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:40:33
They way I understand it is that Segwit and the other off chain schemes that BTC supports benefit third parties who manage those pathways whereas bigger blocks supported by BCH funnels fees to miners.  So I think it is obvious that the miners would support BCH over BTC.  I still have no idea who is going to win this fight so I'm holding both.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:21:55

no if you wanna be a pussy go buy some cds from a bank.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:39:05
I'll still buy but I'm not happy about it!  lol.  I was watching gdax last night and saw some fucker buy 146 btc in a single trade so I know there's a lot of demand even at this level.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:51:18
I've seen the 64 BTC bot get hit plenty of times.  Usually just for a handful of BTC but sometimes a big buyer comes in and buys them all.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:19:23
I think BTC is at $10k at the fork and B2X will be at $2500 initially.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:18:20
I did my part.  I just bought another couple BTC at 7450.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:58:40
I don't think $10K is the top but at $10K you're potential profits are much lower.  $100k I think is possible.  At $350k, btc is valued the same as gold.  $1m may be possible in our lifetime but is pretty far away and prolly not gonna happen.
So realistically, at $10k, you could get make 35x your money 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:53:38
I wonder what the real BTC supply is.  It certainly won't be 21M.  I bet there's 18M or less to go around.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:17:15
But it will be cash settled so how will it directly affect the BTC price?  No futures trades will directly result in BTC buying or selling unless the traders want to buy/sell directly on a BTC exchange to mitigate risk.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:16:55
I traded my free BTG for some more BTC.  Thanks BTG guys!  More forks please!

@_date: 2017-11-05 18:16:39
I bought a bunch at 3600 and my wife called me an idiot and told me to wait for a drop.  It then went straight to 5000 but also dropped to 3000 after that.  We're still holding, and even bought more, but I'm not sure which one of us was right.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:40:28
haha.  If you waste your btc holdings on a shitcar like tesla then you're an idiot.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:31:01
I went into this assuming they were going to give the IRS our info.  It would be pretty dumb to think otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:56:11
2025:  Bitcoin crashed from $125,000 to $110,000.  I totally called that, losers.  Shoulda listened to me.

We'll find out the truth in 50 years like we just found out that LBJ was probably responsible for killing JFK.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:47:21
Yeah, it is hilarious.  Green Day had a hugely popular song about how Americans are idiots for trusting US media and then when Turmp ran they started telling Americans they're retards for not trusting them.  Trump Derangement Syndrome!
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:19:42
hey china if you could ban btc again so I could buy more... that would be great.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:59:39
Volume is pathetically low and you'd end up with Zim Bob Dollars even if you could sell there.  Good luck exchanging those for anything.  LOL.

@_date: 2017-09-13 15:23:35
That's probably true.  Do they post average trasnaction size?  Whenever I look at tradeview, most of the trades are much less than 1 btc.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:37:38
I thought jiaozi meant dumplings.  Gyoza in Japan.  Same thing I think.

@_date: 2017-09-11 14:22:29
China is interested in control.  Do they get more control from banning, limiting, regulating, or ignoring?
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:17:19
Hard to beleive.  If 1/4 follow through and buy 1 btc, that's 2.55 million BTC purchased just through coinbase.
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:26:31
She was such a visoinary.  Wonder if she actually bought any or just likes to remember that she told us so.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:33:35
Not much different than the US.  At 50K/month, I can save half that with a family.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:07:58
I installed a BTC wallet/miner back when BTC was trading under $10.  I ran it for a couple hours and when I didn't get any BTC, I thought it wasn't working or worth the effort of troubleshooting so I turned it off.  :(
Then I forgot all about it until it ran to $1250.  I told my wife we should buy some when it fell back down to $250-$750.  She called it a scam and we passed on it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:44:16
tesla cars can be remote controlled by the manufacturer.  fuck that pos.

I thought jiaozi meant dumplings.  Gyoza in Japan.  Same thing I think.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:36:13
We're going to have to start pricing BTC in wheelbarrows of cash.  Otherwise, the numbers are just going to be too big.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:41:56

@_date: 2017-09-27 17:02:41
GDAX volume is down big.  Before the China ban news it was 10,000 BTC/day, then it rose to 40,000/day during and now it is down to 8,000.  If Coinbase is signing 100k new accounts a month, why is volume collapsing?
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:13:52
Why does it even matter once the Fork happens you hold both coins who cares which one goes to a million and which one goes to zero?

No, you should buy 10 of them.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:51:21
So far gemini is my favorite exchange that takes USD deposits.  Their crypto selection is too meager though and if you like alt coins, it means you gotta buy some btc through them and then transfer somewhere else to buy what you really want which makes it a lot more expensive.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:56:19

Fuck. Looks like my $5500 order isn't getting filled.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:05:20
If this is cash settled then this will never directly impact the BTC price.  No BTC need to be used, it is just an avenue for gamblers to bet dollars on what price they think BTC will be on any given month.
