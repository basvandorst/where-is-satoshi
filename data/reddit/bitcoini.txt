See, all Wiki users are not Bitcoiners and do not endorse it; you have to live with it. You have to concede the right to others to disagree with you.

Is it hard for tech savvy people to not know about Bitcoin. I guess he knew about it for long but was not sure about investment and when he realized, he bought them cheaper.

See, they are citing the source and you dispute the source. Wikipedia will give positive and negative both aspects. I think Bitcoin customers are wise enough to distinguish whether the currency is good or bad. Why to worried about Wiki.

Bitcoin, the money 3.0 is definitely going to change the way governments are being run. These can also be used for transforming the way social works are seen. If Bitcoin is unable to meet the requirements for the essential change, it will fail big time to fulfill its role.

German government can profit from the earnings from Bitcoin Conference as virtual currency Bitcoin has been recognized by the German Finance Ministry as a "unit of account", meaning it is can be used for tax.

This is not actually BTC ATM as it does not provide services that are similar to traditional ATMs. It is like a kiosk. I am still waiting for the first genuine BTC ATM.

Small sized companies have a lot to gain from Bitcoin. A good decision indeed. Hope they deliver good services and do not let let down Bitcoin.

Why there is no information about Bitcoin Konferenz in English media? It's very unfortunate.

It is quite important to ensure safety of Bitcoin even if it comes at higher cost. Though I did not lost much just three Bitcoins, I still repent. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 12:00:33
It is definitely going to help customers if such services are made available for customers from around the world. Bitcoin must reach to wide audience locally and internationally.

Bitcoin can get a lot of support if it starts contributing for some cause. A Bitcoin can make difference to the lives of so many people. Such things should be promoted in Africa and South Asia where majority of poor live.
