I think I see a few reverse head and shoulders in there too, BUY BUY BUY

Is this well known? I’ve never heard of it but is it like a common thing all mothers know
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:58:21
sell your house too, going homeless is worth it when you’ll be a billionaire in a few weeks

No, the raging bull pattern is 98.73% successful at predicting bull markets

Wow that sounds well hidden, send me a photo of the key on the back so I know how to do it myself ;)

"A currency has been increasing in value at a certain rate so it must keep going forever because MATH"
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:04:07
Exactly.  The approximately 1k that I have in bitcoin wouldn't be life-changing if it just went to zero, but it would be lifechanging if it got multiplied by 100, or 1000.
Edit: I meant $1000 not 1000 BTC hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:26:50
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:53
Well I don't have any, I was just saying even if I did.  Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:22:14
Why's that?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:14:05
In all seriousness what’s wrong with 100 dollars into bitcoin? I have probably 300 in bitcoin, 350 in monero, and 300 in Ethereum. It’s not a huge amount but I really wouldn’t like to lose more than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:33:51
hey, if bitcoin really hits 1M then it will be worth a grand!
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:15:42
You think the 0.001082 BTC I have floating around might ever do anything for me?  It's almost 19 bucks now, is there a possibility that that much BTC will ever do much for me?
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:26:18
Why would they do that?  That seems completely unreasonable, why would someone not be allowed to trade bitcoin for an item if they wanted to?
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:25:20
Ok, can someone explain what that means? Is it just a pump or is the recent spike really good for us?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:03
I’m not trolling I just didn’t know. Jesus, that’s why I asked instead of doing anything for real. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:20:30
Lmao and that’s why I didn’t buy. I didn’t know much about it which is why I asked. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:21:21
Never heard of it but from the screenshot I’d say unlikely

@_date: 2017-12-31 23:51:56
Hasn't dogecoin actually been one of the least volatile cryptos?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:06:12
No one 'knew what bitcoin would become'.  No one could possibly know that, even if they *thought* it had a lot of potential.  5x ROI is good, I respect him for taking his profit and running.  It's an important skill to have, because by holding longer than necessary you could make more money, but you could also lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:23:46
How is that not too good to be true?  Like why would anyone send with coinbase if they can just transfer to GDAX for no fee then send from there?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:20:52
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:53:49
So is that good or are we probably heading back down?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:29:52
Not even a joke though I bought at 19.5k :/
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:35:43
One of us, one of us, gooble gobble gooble gobble
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:24:28
Yeah electrum can’t recieve BCH, it’s only for BTC. idk where it is now but looks like it may be gone for good. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:18:12
This is our concern Dude.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:28:45
Go ahead if you want. I assume it pays in BTC and you don’t have to give too much info like banks, etc?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:26:12
lol or just keep their seed for them
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:21:50
lol yes
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:29:31
Lol problem with that is, how do you know when the climb has really started? Then before you know it it’s over 20k and you missed it in a couple days. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:07
Thanks for answering calmly.  People in here acting like I just dropped a mil on it already.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:20:44
Lol why is eth and litecoin a scam?  How about something like monero, are you saying that's a scam too?
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:32:41
Please chill, people should make their own decisions about where to put their spare money. I personally have a lot invested in BTC but that doesn’t mean I think it’s a safe investment in any sense of the word. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:57
OK, I'll bite.  Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:12:50
Quick! A reverse head and shoulders! Buy buy buy!
When are people going to realize that TA is a load of horseshit?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:51:48
Shut the fuck up. It’s people like who who encourage noobs to buy in with a ton of money and then just never take it out because it couldn’t possibly ever crash right? This market is volatile and speculative as fuck, and it is a real possibility that at some point the bubble will pop and everyone will lose everything. Buy low and sell high is the core principal behind every investment in the world. If you are happy with the amount you’ve made and feel that staying in is too risky, then cashing in your coins is **smart**. RemindMe! 1 year, let’s see how this fucker plays out. You could be right. But you could also be very very wrong.

Toilet water doesn’t really drain different directions but if you actually drained a completely static pool in the northern and Southern Hemispheres they would actually circle in opposite directions.

When are you eating your left ball?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:40:07
Honestly the taboo around discussing money at work was literally started by employers who didn’t want clients unionizing 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:51
oh shit.  So you're saying that even if I was sitting on a ton right now I couldn't cash out?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:38:16
And afterwards? Are you on the long term hold game or what? I don’t wanna lose my fucking money if this really is a bubble
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:06:41
Wait you guys are actually using cloud mining? Isn’t that always a scam because if they could actually make money off of it the company would just mine it themselves?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:28:07
Good, everyone panic and sell, I’ll be sitting here quietly buying more as it tanks 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:21:12
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:58:56
Lol he said "That is one of the worst charts I've ever seen".  But yeah I agree with you, I didn't think of that. According to this chart we'll be at 1 million in 2023 lmao
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:56:24
Because everyone thinks the bubble is popping now
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:23:12
HAIL SATAN
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:44:49
why is the chart bad?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:02:58
Lol im not saying I seriously think that I was just saying that if I lose $1000 it won’t matter too much but there’s a chance it’ll still go up a lot. Also a big portion of that thousand is in monero which I do think could see huge gains. And if you seriously think anyone “knew” bitcoin would get huge then you’re retarded. Fuck off. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:50:44
How did you hide the key?
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:21:35
Lucy harris smart smart smart, martin harris dumb.
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:51:12
Lol how’s it looking now? You still think you’re guaranteed that second marshmallow?
