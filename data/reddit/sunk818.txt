Before BTC ever has a chance of not being converted to fiat, merchants will want it converted to fiat. service providers may even guarantee a fiat value per day just to get the business and adoption going. someone has to take the risk... and if merchants feel there is too much difficulty or risk, why bother? so, someone else has to take on the risk and burden for crypto &lt;-&gt; fiat conversions to be seamless.

As long as balance in your wallet is confirmed, I think anything under $25 could just be approved instantly. Even if 6 blocks are not confirmed, I'm not going to worry about a $5 latte being fraud.

Is this any different from debit cards that convert instantly from btc to Fiat at purchase? I don't really see consumers using btc as their base currency but whatever the official currency in that country is. Maybe for frequent travellers auto conversion from whatever Fiat is useful. I don't see what's the big deal. Other companies like stk (circle) are doing this too. Unless there's another financial crisis where Fiats inflation model (printing money) is more apparent, I don't see adoption being anything but slow and for geeks at this time.

Lightning will be a problem because KYC (know your customer) regulations will require you to know who is sending you payment. At least for USA, this is a no go. So, we are back to slow Bitcoin. I really don't see Bitcoin being used for micropayments. It just has all the parameters like blocktime and transaction fees making it unusable. I think an altcoin figuring out these issues will grow adoption in emerging nations. crypto to fiat stable value is a concern, but getting close to real-time or having a trustless way to instantly approve low dollar values will be necessary.

Pay with LTC (LiteCoin) instead. But I'm curious... Does Subway pay the transaction fee by discounting the sandwich, or buyer has to pay the transaction fee too? Why bother other the novelty of saying you stupidly bought a $5 sandwich with Bitcoin (BTC)?

50 cents on a $10 pizza. That is a 5% transaction fee. That's more than a credit card (3% or less). Papa John's should be accepting Litecoin not Bitcoin for low dollar tickets.

Don't be such a snob. BTC still takes an hour to get 6 confirmations and you pay a pizza worth of transaction fees. BTC still has a long to go before its all that and a bag of chips.
You could take BTC online using a third-party service like BitPay that does the exchange from BTC to fiat for you.  STK and a few others are working on real-time exchange between crypto and fiat. They will build the bridge and that when I think Bitcoin will actually be more usable on a daily basis. You could even select which fiat or crypto you want to exchange in real-time to your arbitrage benefit.

Overstock lost to Amazon. Overstock has too much competition.

Can someone explain if this is different from Bitmessages?

I'll believe it when Starbucks makes the announcement. Probably fake pump news like last time.
