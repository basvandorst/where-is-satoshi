If he was married she probably just thought it was some stupid hobby like anyone might probably would have at the time. I spent some time trying to find footage of the operation essentially, but i think he or "they" wiped it, gov. came in and told him to close up shop with little fuss, he did.

Cash app is the PERFECT solution to bringing an average person into btc, it's perfect for your girlfriend or wife. Almost everything is instant with sending whatever kind of money, and you can not only have a chipped card from them that you can customize some of the design on [sleek black card] but you can pull it up as a virtual card on your phone whenever you like too. The limits are actually decently high too

lot of "absolutes" get thrown around because of the "romantic" notion of the cypherpunks crushing governments and doing away with the current monetary system, current voting system, identity system, medical systems, food tracking etc. etc..

One of my earliest ways of getting some BTC was through BITINSTANT.

even though they accept it, they aren't readily holding it/utilizing it beyond the processing of the transactions (I assume. i could be wrong) They accept it via 
Bitpay. in other words they're going to cash out most of the bitcoins the receive instantly because they are not in the business of "gambling" on BTC volatility. Same with Newegg, Dell, Tigerdirect etc. ...One can hope that more and more people start holding (and more proper "locking" services like BitReserve) spring up

Soon enough more and more people will realize that this technology is as game changing as the internet itself. In under 5 years it's the fastest computing network on the planet next to the internet itself and still increasing. VC funding into crypto-currency companies has already far exceeded the 90's era ".com era" in capitol. It is super simple to accept (and still immediately receive u.s. dollar). It's programmable and open-source hence, creating this post. I'm stoked for the future, and I'm kinda surprised how un-eager some of the other posters are to even consider that this could in fact be a major addition to an already major video game release or maybe help the devs out a little BIT. I just ate my burrito that I got with a Visa card linked to one of my bitcoin accounts (Coinbase),not a bank account. If i buy something online with BTC, it's quicker, far more secure, and easier than any other option out there and saves the merchant processing fees that they would have had otherwise. If a game is to have a currency, there's no reason the same economic rules wouldn't apply, so if it works so well irl, why wouldn't it work in a game, especially one like this. Let's hypothetically say RSI accepted 55 millions usd all through paypal in the last few years...i don't even want to know how much Paypal got for that, i'm sure it's disgusting
@_date: 2014-10-20 06:13:01
I'm homad and I'm an addict..Depends how well you "use/utilize" bitcoin. for instance, as a consumer you could use a bitcoin debit card or buy from overstock/dell etc.. but, guess what, that just puts sell pressure back on the market after you already bought you're bitcoin. or, another scenarior is maybe you, sell at consistent arbitrage easily possible in some areas on localbitcoins. there's not any real "reason" that i can see of why bitcoin would simply rise in usd value anytime soon (but, that's the gamble!), it's useful regardless of the price in SO MANY WAYS. ask you're loved ones' how they feel about it, if they all say the same thing, chances are you REALLY need to listen/consider what they're saying.

Snapcard bookmarklet was the easiest/fastest/simplest way to order anything online bar non, yet, they did away with that service offering :/ . I email web companies suggesting bitpay/coinbase/snapcard integration and make sure to indicate that it will probably take a small amount of time/effort/energy/funding for any company to implement it. Disclaimer I'm generally all in, all the time, price doesn't matter, this is paradigm shifting technology regardless, most people are unaware of this (think bitcoin is a company, or just a currency etc)

So. These are what is known as stop gap solutions. They allow the consumer (us) to do anything we would do otherwise with a check/bank card/paypal/skrill etc. but with bitcoin. It's great stuff to hold us over until everyone just figures out it's best to accept/use crypto directly
1. currently beta card (based in S.F. CA) you can use about anywhere Visa is accepted  linked to your Coinbase account
2. Use BTC to buy about anything online (they have also facilitated car sales)  &lt;--if you link this to your Coinbase account it's literally the fastest way to order a product online ever

 They're essentially stored in the "aether" of the protocol, but whoever has the "private key" is able to move them around. In practice though this is generally much easier to do with help from all the great services/apps/software out there now.

thank you. We're all pretty much doing this to help out a friend in need. I wouldn't have helped if i didn't really dig the simplicity of the product...that a lot of people still have yet to see/use yet. It may look like a crack pipe or whatever, but most thc users aren't doing it to look cool or go do it in an alley while pedestrians walk by. Most dab rigs are expensive, and require more steps/sticky complication to accomplish the same thing. Nectar Collector and some others have the worked/artistic/collectable straw covered. I especially dig their one with a multi-colored hologram design inspired by Laser Guided Visions

$2,500 is the cheapest tier for vending in a 4x4 spot....way too high, right? ..not to mention, i never heard back from anyone last time i tried to make contact? tickets are still over 200 a piece and it's far from downtown. Am I missing something? Are people actually buying these pricey tickets to this event? SXSW is expensive enough on it's own....

I changetip A LOT on reddit (don't care about the price).
Bitcoin Debit card (hardly care about price, i'm buying FOOD [mostly])
 for online purchases anywhere online (don't care about price, either i want some product or i talk myself out of it because we as humans don't really need that much to survive)
Just the other day i found .01 in an old mining pool. 
Threw probably 100BTCish into a gambling site (when they were $10ish/btc), simply learning about how to use bitcoin (regret is a fools game). Just keep buying/hodling. seems simple enough for where we're at and heading. I can't wait to ditch the plastic cards and stupid banks entirely (probably next couple of years at this rate)
@_date: 2014-07-09 04:33:36
yeah, i can only justify these (imo) great companies doing what they do because it's part of the process.. multiple females i have brought up bitcoin with immediately asked....well can i use my bitcoins "with a card" (at all the places they already go to)...furthermore, there are plenty of merchants that i have reached out to, and they just have their software checkout setup by some i.t. guy. and it just seems way too complicated to add bitpay/coinbase to most ignorant (to bitcoin) people

yeah, do it yourself, cheaper, no insurance/obamacarap necessary, if that's what you're into. trans-humanism n whatnot. but yeah, pretty much since day one of learning about BTC I've considered that the "end-game" if this tech was literally designed/released as part of one world money conspiracy linked to Identity etc. (doubt it) that the gov. chipping people would be a part of that....but then would come along the BTC biohackers that would continue to balance the universe against tyrannical governments

I do this because i want to teach people about a better technology. Just like i tell everyone about bitcoin when appropriate. ..did, with the internet, did with DJ "culture"...did with video games. all these "stupid" little niche things, that are now extremely popular the world over. Am I a trendsetter? I don't know, who cares. Do I support the things I love and have brought me joy in my life. Yes.

In other words it says "pre-ordered" (ok...when should I expect?). She mentioned something about $15 flat fee for card...Did I pay that? Can it be paid in bitcoin or wire only?

It wouldn't let me disable before because they owed me like 3 dollars.. hehe recently went into a restaurant that accepted paypal. i asked how that would work, and the guy was like, "through your email, it's really stupid"...to which i then handed him my visa and told him to look into coinbase and bitpay and that they could still get their precious $usd while allowing us to use our BTC

the 10k thing as I best understand it now is this (in America). If you make a cash deposit of over 10k at once (or 5k, in two immediate days), they will often ask something like, "what is your occupation?" (be prepared for that). Then beyond that I'm pretty sure they will report your "Currency Transaction Report" (CTR) with the Treasury Department. and generally nothing will come of it (unless of course you are "dirty"). get an account with a credit union if you can. same stuff applies, but yeah, research credit unions.

if you link coinbase you need to make sure the proper amount of BTC is inside your coinbase account...if you chose the other option they will send you a new qr code per order (by way of bitpay i think)... in other words, having linked coinbase to your 
snapcard account, they don't have permission to automatically draw funds from your bank to get you your btc for the order.
But, lets say you have a bunch of btc in your coinbase account, you can then go around the internet doing secure 2click/3 second buys wherever you want online (because snapcard has your address already)

Figuring out "why" with most things, is a deep rabbit hole. maybe it's 42. maybe it's love. maybe it's god. maybe it's astrology.

conceptually "cheaper" for merchants all over the place to just use the built in mics on their computers/devices (or plug one in)...easier to integrate instead of expensive NFC upgrade (in both mobile devices and POS systems)...crypto dominates all this in my book. similar to ISIS, you can have all your credit card info "in an app" (eww)

yeah, OP post makes it seem a lot worse than it really is. bitcoin is helping us accomplish MANY beautiful things.

Just like some places offer cash discounts, bitcoin discounts are of course encouraged. there is a silver/gold bullion store in town that charge 2% more (this was 6ish months ago...maybe they changed it) for using bitcoin. i left there, thinking, YOUR DOING IT WRONG...but with that kind of business i can imagine they were more just like, lets just try it and see sort of approach +of course their Coinbase processing is more traceable than the USD paper notes :/

it's hybrid battery (the same one that is normally in the buggy), and fuel cell. The hydrogen is stored in solid state material inside "hydrostiks". Because it's solid state storage it's safe to legally take two of them on a public flight (I've charged my phone while flying with it before). I haven't timed it all out, but i think it gives it about 45mins-1hr instead of just 15mins or so on the battery alone. You can fill the hydrostiks with the "hydrofill" (electrolysis machine) by pluggin it into a wall outlet. However, ideally one would plug it into a solar/wind etc. so that you create a completely renewable storage solution

"It has no economy, no monetary policy, no centralized government, nor even any intrinsic value. It is driven by pure supply and demand" ...well not exactly...i would say the intrinsic value of the invention is that "data can be sent anywhere securely" and it being a public ledger etc. ..otherwise I'm really, VERy, stoked someone is already researching this. Bitcoin pricing has always seemed very "organic" to me. It's based in mathematics (the language of nature) and has not had much time to become very "perverted" and uber manipulated [like precious metals).

maybe they can help us understand why we can have a bank/paypal account and hardly ever get asked a damn thing, but, for Coinbase we get asked:
"- Please briefly describe the primary use case for your Coinbase account
- Please describe the source of the bitcoin being deposited into your account that was not purchased through Coinbase
- Please indicate the source of funds for your purchases of bitcoin
- Please elaborate on the nature of your outgoing transfers and what service(s) they are related to"

 &lt;--for those that don't know. beta program has shipped visa cards that work just about anywhere visa is accepted (can connect to Coinbase API)...so if your card gets stolen, just zip your BTC out of your coinbase account, and/or disconnect the API, and inform Shift to send you a new one.

Sure it's possible, but the coins are in Gemini custody \[\*shrug if that matters\], they are NYC regulated, the guy  running it acts like any other straight edge banker as a  white collared white dude \[there are some decent interviews with him out there\]. In other words it seems about as likely, as the Winklevoss twins and Brian Armstrong, just saying fuck it, we're out. They'd be in jail in a week if they pulled something like that, they know that.   
  
| edit: Wouldn't recommend putting entire stack if it's a substantial size to you, until they have more of a "coming out presence" with the community, or a track record of reporting their customers' W-9s for years to come kinda thing. Even coinbase earned the name Conbase in it's early years from it's deplorable actions, maybe some of that bad behavior has morphed into other bad behaviors \[shilling alt-coins for example. Most people with big stacks in blockfi won't admit to their performance either, because 1. they don't waste time on reddit 2. they don't want to state online they have a grip of btc in any capacity 3. Similar to mining, if you are in there first and less people join after, that's generally in your best interest to not tell people to join

i think it was October 2013. Met face/face at some theater/little food bar on congress n 7th or so.  Fed me a story of getting BTC from me to then sell to someone in town who was on TV and didn't want me to see him. I bought into it given prior experiences with him. He pretended to be on the phone with the guy (or one theory is he got in bad with someone somewhere and might have actually been on phone with that person that he was trying to pay back). Took my BTC on pretense that he would bring cash back to me. Never came back. Fuck him. such a selfish prick[always trying to get top dollar for anything and everything, never doing it for the good of the community/cutting deals etc.] ...another side-theory is that he actually has a high ranking judge in TX as a father[same last name similar appearance]. Always whack vibes from him from moment i shook his hand. Only cool thing he ever did was buy out all the pizza [with BTC] for everyone from friends' pizza truck who brought "the pizza underground" [Macaulay Culkins' band]

"The third parties who gained control over Shapiro's wireless number  "used that control to access and reset the passwords for Mr. Shapiro's  accounts on cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including KuCoin,  Bittrex, Wax, Coinbase, Huobi, Crytopia, LiveCoin, HitBTC, Coss.io,  Liqui, and Bitfinex," the lawsuit said. Hackers also changed the  passwords "for approximately 15 of Mr. Shapiro's online accounts,  including four email addresses, his Evernote account... and his PayPal  account," the lawsuit said.
After taking control of his cryptocurrency accounts, "hackers then  transferred Mr. Shapiro's currency from Mr. Shapiro's accounts into  accounts that they controlled. In all, they stole more than $1.8 million  from Mr. Shapiro in the two consecutive SIM swap attacks on May 16,  2018," the lawsuit said."

Different people can utilize bitcoin in MANY ways, the beauty is CHOICE...it's programmable money :) Bitcoin can be utilized in just about ANY situation in which two+ parties require trust. Mathematics ftw | A rich american might wanna get his coffe with a BTC topped Visa (from Bitpay or Shift/Coinbase after submitting their identity | tax implications) but, on the other end of the spectrum is a 12 year Ugandan kid can be connected to a world economy {accept crowd payments/donations/buy supplies etc. with a shitty SMS capable cell phone

They probably accept visa at 99.9% of their locations because it can handle that volume FAST. Bitcoin can handle that (with lightning network eventually) I'm pretty sure. When payments take even a second or two longer on their worldwide scale, they stand to lose millions of dollars a year

SOOOO, it turns out as cool as games are/would be with crypto, MOOOST \[such as this one\] simply don't need it and it's unnecessary. Would I absolutely love to integrate this stuff in games like STar Citizen, yes absolutely, but the truth is, most people will just downvote this idea for ages, because it scares them. The game creators can just create whatever currency they want and adjust it however they want, it's just easier

it's a very powerful app in that one can link a bank account extremely fast/intuitively and it has built in intuitive locks to currencies. || imagine for instance you explain to your friend his money is held on his phone no way to retrieve it unless he writes down/records backup, then they can simply link bank account in under few minutes. you can send them btc, and they can simply cash out ach to bank at their leisure || 
where that can easily go wrong in current state is that said friend might delete the app after you send him btc because he thinks it works like paypal or something where they hold his money for him
 just pick what currency you want and it locks to that until you change it (prob. "lose some" when you change that to something else)...they ask for email and phone number i think it was, but then you can link a bank account or just use it like a crypto-lock capable btc wallet || i can't remember the fees part frankly when i witnessed a bank ach buy through them for 10 dollars worth

SharedCoin disappearing the way it did, was a clear and present sign that the war is "real". The metaphor to be drawn i think is along the lines of what the piratebay founder has been speaking of (although he's very defeatist which is hard to swallow). Everyone who has been fighting for a more "open/free" internet has seen that battle be consistently lost (data caps/monopolies on providers/data surveillance from top down etc.).... Banks give me an extra lollipop when i make a deposit like I'm a damn five year old [i just wanna unwrap it and shove it in a tellers mouth, bitcoin badger don't like fuckin lolipops], their atms wish me a belated birthday (because they care so much), they ask me what i'm up to when i withdraw more than like 500 bucks, and encourage me to open a savings account every time they notice i'm probably one of their 1% who don't actually have one.

Being able to buy btc with simplish online methods or walking into hundreds of thousands of businesses everywhere by hopping on the weird red phone or whatever methods there were. SHIT WAS GENIUS....and then it got all fucked up because of his legal jargon. Seriously, think about it, MANY years later and no one has made it THAT EASY to go near anon. buy some from going to a 7-11 or  CVS or similar | You would think the shark tank guys or someone would get that shit in every fucking 7-11 across the globe and reap the 1-12% markup

so. the quick and easy is click "market". you tell how much USD you want to spend and voila you will get the market rate of that amount in BTC | others are more advanced, such as "limit" you could pick the price  you want to buy at (obviously if you pick $3,000 no one is going to sell to you at that price anytime soon, if ever)

yes. but even worse. you have to send out said 100 dollars to receive. take this classic hypothetical example | 
1. I open a channel/fund it with 100 dollars
2. I lightning it to gaming site, and win 400 dollars
3. I go to receive my 500 dollars and wallet tells me I can only receive 100
| why this has been so difficult to get a simple answer as to how to receive lightning is very alarming for current state of lightning (either I am spewing blasphemy or it's just complex to do now, and will be easier in the future with more development)

I’ve been fascinated by Bitcoin for months, and have made reasonable profits trading with it, but I sought a means to develop a viable trading strategy.

EXCELLENT. i think this is literally one of the most important "end game" theories people need to be considering in blockchain tech/government/politics. it is that of IDENTITY. Since my first month thinking about BTC, I still keep coming back to the idea of "connecting" ones' ID on a "state or federal level" to their DNA. scenario: you are born in the hospital, and here comes the oracle problem [but ignore that for now] . your dna via blood is immediately connected to a hash or even a public key that is say your "bank account" seen and known by the government ....you see where i'm going with this...pretty dystopian until the oracle problem is solved and you will still have identity swaps/hackers figuring out some crazy shit | edit : a day later this pops up holy shit!

Guys, I want this shit to allow for a bazillion transactions of any size instantly just like the rest of us....but here we are getting downvoted for trying to simply understand how to receive a payment. with BTC, if one has a pub address it can be sent to.

1. ethereum and ethereum classic are the equivalent to the upcoming no replay protection issue in BTC. One is the evil corps. obvious hostile takeover where you can simply choose to make transactions null and void because of "the terrorists" and one is for the people by the people ("true" democracy in front of our very stupid eyes)
2. from what I understand ethereum network just like blatantly shuts down and doesn't work [that's fucking dumb] because the code base is already a shitshow. i'm sure you can find that lil turd Vitalik speaking to this issue somewhere
3. Even an exchange as regulated up the ass and hot shit with New York, Coinbase/GDAX ETH/USD crashed to like $0.25 mere MONTHS ago
4. Banks and Putin love ethereum. ask yourself why that might be. it's prety obvious...control
|| I'm not a hater per se. i would love to be proven wrong on any of these points...but as a store of value. come on, it's obvious bitcoin is at least better at that...i think everything that is done on eth will eventually be able to be done better on top of BTC with higher levels of security and privacy

it's not "their debit card" please stop saying that. It's a Visa card provided by Shift Payments, connected via Coinbase API
@_date: 2015-11-21 06:38:31

But if someone puts in an order your site says, HOORAY your bitcoins will arrive at _______time, and then they don't. FDIC can't really do anything about that now, can they?

i think the best positive perspective to hold is that young people even children are getting to experience such a thing...as long as they aren't losing large sums of money/becoming gambling addicts, they're just excited, they've never experienced something like it (can't even legally buys stocks for instance). it's new a it's fun/exciting not heard the broken record for enough rotations on the platter enough...just like i can dance to the sound of my fan for periods of time or the beat of the toaster oven timer lol

I am long since done using Coinbase. YOU CAN CANCEL ORDERS WHENEVER YOU LIKE and blame it on your "algorithms". It almost always seemed to be to Coinbases' financial advantage (with price fluctuations), whilst screwing the customer. We've been saying this for YEARS in this subreddit. That's not O.K. When i go do a wire transfer at a bank, the bank can't just be like, oh nevermind, and then still float my funds around for A WEEK OVER AND OVER AGAIN for literally no STATED LOGICAL reason. And another topic; EMAIL SUPPORT ONLY!? REALLY? Coinbase is the last company i recommend to people now because of all this. Maybe I'm missing something here, but Coinbase fucked me over countless times, I gave them more personal info that I ever would have considered giving ANY company, and they couldn't give a shit how much I supported them in the past. A company is a great way to rid ourselves of personal responsibility, so I know it's not all your fault John ;)  As for your "inaccurate payout dates", it should just say "hey, congrats MAYBE YOUR BITCOINS will arrive on ____time even though we already have your money"

it's a defense mechanism to be skeptical. it's been ever more useful in the last decade+ because of so many organizations/big companies/governments/police etc. have completely lost trust of the public given their actions and blatant lying/propaganda. BUT THEN, comes RESEARCH or personal experience which those people are ignorantly lacking.
| is what you are looking for. i got mine through this user they have probably easily done over $100k in trades
| it was exactly what i was looking for because not only did i get to do it "easily with bitcoin" but, because i got to ask him a few clarification questions on what i should get. it reminds me of localbitcoins.com because a lot of early noob users get to not only acquire their first btc but from someone who might generally take a moment to explain what they can and how to send/receive/use it

if you use their wallet service to buy/sell Coinbase can just cancel your buy/sell orders, making it effectively, even MORE OF A GAMBLE than a slot machine.

my assumption is they are either going to slam us with like all these hot companies accepting it "overnight" via paypal/braintree. and then be like, see how easy it was, no all you other smaller, less known companies, can do it too, here's how kinda thing. we'll see. but yeah, currently with braintree/Paypal companies' can accept bitcoin as i understand it, pulled out of beta in the last few weeks

very liberating indeed. I'm getting really tired carrying these easily fraudulent plast cards around.. i'm one who has a hard time walking away from my "reddit control center" to the other room for the check book once a month to pay rent..and an even more difficult time busting out a writing utensil to write on both it, and the envelope, to then have to take it to the mailbox, where multiple gass guzzling trucks take the destroyed tree to it's destination....another bank

Also see Snapcard which allows for spending bitcoin at almost any online store for a mere 2%
 BETA opened yesterday. love it so far + it's run by "superheros" (they first started a superhero costume laundry service in California before realizing they were more passionate about bitcoin than they are other peoples' laundry)

get some yourself! (you can get just 10 bux worth, in case you didn't know, you don't have to get 1 full btc) shoot buy some from your son, and he probably will have just made some "profit" and you are basically paying a small amount of money to learn about one of the greatest advances to "money" ever. you can donate them/store them/use them for goods etc.

AGREED!!! "Thanks! Snapcard is literally the single most useful bitcoin-related service I've experienced next to coinbase so it is wonderful to see direct interaction like this. Good luck" Yesterday, when they started their beta, I ordered a gas card from Walmart (since I can't with egifter anymore) and a line level converter from Amazon to hook my sub/amp up in my stock Prius. I also got direct, quick communication from support. AAAAND I get to imagine them sitting at their computers in their old super hero uniforms from their previous company endeavor

@_date: 2013-10-24 03:34:24
While we are ranting they should display the price you bought at, next to all the previous transactions. Trying to manage all the delays with banks, this is a must (having to click only to see the TOTAL $ is really annoying!), the PROPER numbers need to be in plain site. Coinbase, you getting this? Your not fooling anyone, just making your own service really slow and annoying. Otherwise, thanks for the awesome service

I'm all in so to speak. Use. Snapcard. YOU CAN BUY ANYTHING ONLINE WITH YOUR BTC .it's brilliant, and at 1-2% there's nothing better right now that i know of. Until more people adopt bitcoin directly.  ...and yes you can use it on walmart.com to acquire gas cards (if you have a petrol vehicle) delivered to your email

AS  Bloomberg put it  it "Is Just a Money-Market Fund" and then this.... 
"The U.S. economy will inevitably slow at some point and the Fed will cut interest rates. At that point, Robinhood will have two choices: Lower the 3 percent rate on its checking-and-savings product, or invest in riskier securities to maintain above-market interest. Verhage posed that question to the company, to which it said in an email that it would take the first path: “Customers would get an email notification that clearly states the 3 percent interest rate is changing.”" || Robinhood is trash to this subreddit :/ "Pro-Crypto trading" ...yeah that doesn't let you send or receive crypto, !COOL! but hey, there's a trollbox

Dwolla is fantastic. It's intuitive (also). Pricing is easy to understand (unlike paypal). I see it as simply, A BETTER PAYPAL with the lead people understanding that people should be able to do as they please (within the law) with their money. My only issue was they randomly said i was selling "age restricted products" which i was not and never have. i told them it was a mistake, they told me to tell them what i was using dwolla for, i told them (copy pasted) what their site says they are for lol...then they tried again, and i said, i don't know why your asking me this, it's off-putting, then followed up saying it was to send companies money and to send/receive money with friends/family and i haven't heard from them sense, account still works fine ...they are probably one of the few companies like this at the forefront in this country to already be dealing with the regulatory realm of virtual currency (because of the mt gox debacle)..so, i think that is a huge advantage for them

SICK track (the vocal stuff is kinda "unsettling" how it's loud and distorted, but i dig)! I urge all artists to entertain and provide their art for BTC. DJ culture/EDM spawned from getting away from the "money paradigm" (partying/gathering/dancing for the sake of it) but unfortunately has been almost swallowed whole like "rap". I'm using some of my BTC "profits" to upgrade my live sound system to a Bassmaxx sub

some seem to forget/not realize that considering what all you can do with Bitcoin, it doesn't really matter (for many transactions) what $/btc it's at. because you can instantly send it and it's a done transaction. you sent the "value" at that moment.    just like all these other fiats do, it's just not as "recognizable" because they don't fluctuate so "wildly" like btc does in such short time (classic example would be your dollar doesn't simply buy the same thing it did 20 years ago)

i bought water filters from a gold and silver store with Coinbase app. they let me behind the counter to their 1 computer next to two shotguns to scan the bitpay qr code. they had to call their "tech guy" because it took a bit, but, then it worked and i had time to show him the blockchain while waiting for it to send. very liberating novel experience except they actually charge like 3 bux for using btc instead of discounting 3 bux

all you have to tell them is that if they personally acquire btc.. that when they make a "we're accepting btc now"  they will all get richer just like branson did and many others who play the stock market in a similar manner. the quicker "big" companies do that, the easier

Hey everybody, its Steve - the CEO of Massdrop. Please know that we are following this thread and every email that we get very closely. We have attempted to contact the North American distributor that supplied us with the V-Modas to see what is going on. However we have not yet received a response. In our prior communications, we explicitly asked them if the headphones would come with serial numbers, which they said yes, but we didn’t ask them (nor should it have been required) to see if the warranty cards would be included as well. Receiving them in this fashion is simply unacceptable.
We are doing several things to handle this situation:
1) We are canceling orders for anybody who has not yet received their product. This is very unfortunate and we very rarely do this, however we want to make sure that the quality of the products you receive from Massdrop is never in question. We are currently contacting UPS and USPS and will request that your product not be delivered. You will receive a full refund for the amount paid, effective immediately. In addition, we will offer you $50 in credit good towards any drop you join in the future. I know that this does not solve the situation, but it’s an additional token of apology to the group.
2) We'll offer a full, no questions asked refund (and $50 credit) to anybody who has already received their product and is not 100% confident and comfortable with their purchase. Massdrop will cover the costs of your return shipping and we'll process the refund ASAP. Just email support and we will take care of it.
3) If you choose to keep your M100s, we will be available for help with any defects or issues you run into for the next two years. Please note that Massdrop is not an authorized reseller of V-Moda headphones, but our distributors are. If you have any problems with your headphones, you can send them directly to us and we’ll get them replaced, no questions asked. This is the standard policy of how we deal with all manufacturers warranties for any product sold on Massdrop.
Again, our apologies for any difficulties or disappointment that this buy has caused. We have run several hundred drops in the past and have never cancelled one, however after examining all of the evidence posted in the comments, we believe that this is the best course of action for the community. Thanks for your patience and we will update you as we continue to get more information."
||My response: "So, when do we get to the part where you do "solve the situation"???! $50 credit &amp; deposit to Paypal whom all bitcoiners absolutely despise. Really?! What if I don't have paypal because they fucking suck!? You going to send me some silver? Maybe some gold? You have my address...send away! 
Guess i won't be using Massdrop or telling people how great it is anymore, when you guys essentially just indirectly stole hundreds of dollars from me, without even giving me the option to receive my package that I was expecting tomorrow.
....ok, now that I've vented: if people pay in bitcoin, they need to be compensated in bitcoin. Otherwise, you can just scam us all day every day with no buyer protection whatsoever"

lol. i was trying to think how i could fit "psy" in there somewhere. NICE ONE BRUVa!
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:21:35
for now there are also "stop gap solutions" the best being Snapcard ( where you can in a few clicks buy anything anywhere online with your BTC (even emailed gas cards from walmart.com!). there is also egifter/Gyft etc. for digital gift cards at many locations
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:07:05
oh, i didn't realize that. good to know, but spam? what's wrong with sending people "microtransactions"? its one of the beauties of btc
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:07:37
love it
@_date: 2013-06-26 03:39:50
any chance he's interested in my massive orc/goblin/various warhammer army for bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:38:23
this is exactly the moment of clarity i had in kindergarten...hence why i'm so passionate about BTC..because it's the best alternative i know of
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:56:21
yes! i noticed that too. i accidentally copied over my clipboard. glad someone else caught it
@_date: 2013-07-18 03:59:45
lol i just remembered an employee at pizza place sending a whole tomato through the oven...but it didn't smoke
@_date: 2013-09-14 06:00:14
it just happened to an extent with Wells Fargo...bunch of customers unable to do anything, some people being told by Wells Fargo "we can't find your account"
@_date: 2013-09-14 10:21:33
do you get interest for just having btc on the site, or do you have to mcxFEE to earn the interest?
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:49:11
 buy anything online with your BTC with a few clicks. No merchant changes necessary. It's amazing and frankly puts Gyft to shame as much as i appreciate what they are doing
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:10:45
 ...buy anything online with btc (including gas cards from walmart emailed to you)..now gyft has whole foods. done and done
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:02:17
right.  but with gliph, that doesn't matter. gliph is still available and you can use coinbase through gliph
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:49:02
only thing i use gyft for is now whole foods..most all the other businesses are shit to  me . might even just use snapcard instead of gyft for amazon orders. already have for 1 order..its just simpler. i dig the points from gyft..thats def. appreciated
