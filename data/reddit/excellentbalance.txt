But not even 2 weeks ago [you said you worked with dead bodies on the I - 95?](
Looks like you have a wide range of experience in many fields ;) (In other words, you're not a fund manager and you're not convincing anyone either.)
EDIT: Apparently [you seem to like acting as if you have secret political contacts too](
and [you claim that the US economy is going to collapse because of theft from the working class]( This sounds more like something Marx would say than a fund manager to me.

If you store your cash at home in a vault you lose purchasing power through inflation. 
The difference is, inflation in the USD/EUR/GBP can be controlled by the Federal Reserve/European Central Bank/Bank of England and their respective governments, such that businesses and individuals alike are able to know, with good degree of accuracy and confidence, that their money will retain certain value over certain amounts of time.
It is also possible (although not necessarily a good idea, which is why it isn't done often, and doesn't help devalue government debt either) to maintain a 0% inflation rate through fiscal and monetary policy. 
Bitcoin has neither of these features, which are part of ensuring confidence and practical use of a currency in a real world financial system - these problems are exactly why Valve and other companies have abandoned bitcoin.
