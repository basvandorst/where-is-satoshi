The physical medium of currency you hold in your hands is largely what contributes to the perceived worth of that currency. That's the reason artists and designers have spent *thousands* of hours designing exactly what our currency should look like. That's the reason ancient humans used pretty things like shells to do their trading. Until a "bitcoin" can be redeemed into something to hold and feel between your fingers, it will remain **worthless** to the majority of society, just as it is now.

Right, because the system is set up to prevent that exact type of thing through a feeling of (false or not) security. It is a safeguard against itself, and very clever. It's also important to observe that US currency actually has a *static physical medium* backing up the bank notes, where bitcoins are simply strings of 1's and 0's set up in a pretty little algorithm.
It's like basing your currency on ice; during winter you may be rich, but when springtime comes all you can do is watch it melt away.

You can argue whatever you want, but a "mathematical construct" does not a currency make.
I suggest you study how monetary systems work, before you give an opinion about it.

Bitcoins will remain nothing more than little niche coupons to buy drugs and other shit off the internet. But go ahead and keep hoping, I'll be over here investing *real* money for *real* return.

No, those two examples *are not* the same thing.
