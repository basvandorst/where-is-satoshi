All of it. Each and every bit of data on your drives or exchanged via networks.


My point is that they'll be at freedom of reading *everything* for "big data" harvesting, and we won't have any choice but to give in if we don't want to be red-flagged as plausible tax-evaders (for example)


They want *everything*! Analyzing somebody's data and traffic can pretty much enable people to almost read into your mind. THAT'S what they want.

Each die is going to be slightly off-balance so if you keep rolling one die, your numbers are going to be biased.

Using a full node as a wallet is a bad idea imho: Full nodes essentially spend the day shouting "HEY GUYS I'M INVOLVED IN BITCOIN COME IN AND CHECK OUT MY SECURITY THERE'S A 90% CHANCE MY WALLET ISN'T ENCRYPTED, LOL"
Actually running a full node on the same network as you run your wallet from is a bad idea.
So yeah, this VPS node setup thing is the way to go IMHO if you don't know how to setup everything yourself.

I guess they said that to make things easier for people to understand. Since they say that it is a means of money transfer that makes sense. But since they also said that it's becoming a store of value, maybe they could say that some people may choose to keep the Bitcoins in that form!

I think it's different to distinguish Scrypt coins and SHA coins. Their fundamental values are different because mining, so IMHO, speculation aside, they should have differently evolving trends. Scrypt coins have a less significant exposure to ASIC miners so have a different appeal to miners.

Well you would have to have read in detail my whole post, which I admit is a bit long.
But IMHO the only way (in my deliberately paranoid scenario) that Bitcoin can thrive in our world is if that states can levy taxes on it. For THAT to be possible, they'd have to be able to read 100% of our Internet traffic (so as to prevent money hiding and money laundering). That would impose bans on cryptography and installing gov't spyware on all machines (real or virtual). Those kinds of shenanigans have been prototyped in the past, without much luck. But if the IRS wants to enforce it, it'll pass.
Again, this is my tinfoil theory just for the sake of discussion.

All those efforts might seem commendable, and I do think that they might have some value. The sad thing is, you don't start revolutions passively in secluded micro-structures.

My point was that if governments were to legitimize Bitcoin, they'd have to make people give off their privacy so that the IRS (et al.) could tap into your personal data to make sure you aren't laundering money.


Well, that's my whole point. I believe that a LOT of people are starting to distrust banks, and that they'd be more than willing to switch to Bitcoin. My major concern is that they'd more likely adopt freedom *via* Bitcoin than conserve privacy rights (FFS just look at Facebook)

@_date: 2014-04-26 20:49:25
Methinks there should be some sort of financial incentive for running a full node.
I mean: People doing it are providing all of this:
* Disk space
* Bandwidth
* Cost of electricity for running the node
* Cost of hardware aging
* Exposure to security risks because of evidence of (active) involvement in Bitcoin
I know that a realistic price-in would be very meager, but still... Plus, it'd provide incentive for helping the network once all the coins are done being mined
@_date: 2014-08-08 08:04:50
If you're part of the "mainstream" you DON'T want to run a full node. The server spends it time yelling to the entire Internet "HEY Y'ALL I'M INTO BITCOIN - COME AND INVESTIGATE MY SECURITY, CHANCES ARE I'M RUNNING WINDOWS XP WITH NO ANTIVIRUS AND MY WALLET.DAT ISN'T EVEN ENCRYPTED, LOL"

During the 2013 bubble, the only way to short Bitcoin was through some pretty shady means. So the only safe-ish way to profit was to make sure that the price would only increase.

5) Keep it off your LAN.
Host it on a VPS somewhere. Your full node will be yelling 24/7 to the entire Internet that you're into Bitcoin and that it's more than likely that a machine with a (poorly protected) wallet is on the same LAN.

Right now we're about at [300k transactions per day]( That's mostly speculators and very little usage as a currency (I'd love some numbers here to backup my gut feeling).
Now let's say that we going mainstream means that we get two billion active users, [like Facebook has]( Let's also say that each user makes one transaction per day, which doesn't seem unreasonable. That's about 6667x as many transactions as today.
And now if you think that [number of transactions and price can be correlated]( that takes us to a price of today's price (let's say $4200) x 6667, which amounts to $28M per.
Of course you would need to damp this taking into account the [adoption curve of new tech]( but this gives an order of magnitude to get the idea.
Please keep in mind that nothing is keeping Bitcoin from becoming the Myspace of cryptocurrencies, tho...
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:35:36
That's fine.
Just keep in mind that you'll become even more of a target doing so, and so you must be extra careful with anything you do from any computer on that LAN.
@_date: 2018-06-05 05:45:54
I strongly disagree with your point that everybody should run a node, not to mention that you're shaming people who aren't.
Running a full node is not yet for the layman. Doing so amounts to having your computer yelling to the entire Internet 24/7 that you're involved in Bitcoin, and paints a target on your head. If a person is unable to secure their network and computers correctly, they'll put themself at great risk.
So I would moderate your message to "Run a full node on a VPS not on your LAN if you want to do your part"

I'd go with [etching](
First, you wax or varnish a piece of steel.
Then, you carefully etch your private key out of the varnish. Bonus points if you etch a QR code too (good luck with that).
Dip into acid, wait for a bit. The acid will eat through the metal where it was not protected, leaving the rest intact. Rinse.
This seems to me like the cheapest way to go, but I'd make a couple tries first, and ALWAYS use proper precaution.
Protip: You can then use that etched piece of steel to make several paper copies of your wallet, without ever using a computer or risking commiting the wallet to a printer's memory...

What do you think will be their most plausible attack vector? Will they simply start to issue bitcoin loans, so as to create debt again? Will they covertly buy thousands of mining rigs and do a perpetual 51% attack? Will they convince governments that more regulation is necessary?

Other sites give you BTCs for visiting websites (shady SEO)

I don't mean to make you go all tinfoil, but you should really hush down on the details.
Your screenshot and other info you posted are making it really easy to narrow down who you are, what IP you bought your coins from, and now we know where your coins are. I hope your IP changed since then and that your wallet password isn't written in plaintext on that computer...

Well if GPUs can in fact do other things in the same time without affecting mining speed I'd be OK with that - but is that possible?

Well, if you're going to be trading in large quantities, the lack of volume on Bitcoin-Central might be a problem. Look at the order books and do your math... Also, their interface isn't quite optimized for trading.

just sell "your" fucking laptop - you'll make more money, and the end result will be the same. TRUST ME. laptops are NOT designed for prolonged number crunching.

Yes and no.
We have chip and pin here, and basically ATM skimmers also have a webcam watching for your PIN - I always mask my fingers with my wallet while typing my PIN, but that's probably not even enough.
Also, if your card is stolen, it can still be used in countries that don't use PIN numbers: As in the US, a simple signature is sufficient for using your CC, even if it has a chip.

Gee, thanks OP.
You want my prediction? It might go up or it might go down. How much more helpful am I?

"Because the supply of bitcoin is mostly fixed, it has a massive deflationary bias that encourages hoarding. In other words, as the amount of things that bitcoin can buy increases, the value of each coin increases as well. So since each coin should be able to buy more goods in the future than it can today, it's hard to see why consumers would spend bitcoin now when you can use it to buy much more at a later date? "
This is a valid point... Why would anybody want to spend Bitcoins? Sure, there's the "new currency dream", but won't Bitcoin just become the new gold? You don't see many people buying goods with gold...

Do what you please with YOUR own money. Make a couple hundred bucks in profit then buy her a nice present. She'll be convinced instantly.
When I explained to my wife what I've been doing lately she looked kinda disappointed in me until I told her how much I had made - her first reaction? "HOW CAN I INVEST???"

I've been using Bitcoin-Central since march, and have had no problems with it. When they got hacked they closed for a pretty long time, which was frustrating, but I didn't end up losing anything. They were very open about everything that was going on, and answered my emails when I had questions about details.
In terms of interface and ease of use, it's quite minimalist. So yeah, it's easy to use, but some features are missing.
Verification takes a couple days, and when I had problems with my 2-factor auth (I reformatted my phone) the issue was solved quickly.
Bottom line is, I'd recommend them with no problems at all.
HOWEVER. If you plan on speculating, please be aware that as of right now their volume is 193 btc/24h. Bitstamp's volume is... 45830 btc/24h.

IMHO faucets are fine for getting a few satoshis, sending them around and getting comfortable using the network. But PLEASE, for the love of all that matters, don't spend your time reaping coins this way... It's spamming the network with useless traffic and is DEFINITELY not worth anybody's time. You're well better off using Amazon's Mechanical Turk or mowing lawns. Plus I suspect a lot of these sinks are spreading malware, making you solve captchas for malicious activities, money laundering, and generating fake visits to websites.

Please, PLEASE don't run a full node on the same machine that  your wallet is on, or if you're unsure on how to properly secure a network of computers.
Basically, running a full node is like yelling to the entire internet "I'M INVOLVED IN BITCOIN - THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT YOU CAN STEAL SOME FROM ME"

"im not paying electric"
No but your parents/roommates/fellow students/boss are paying. Good job making things more expensive for others.
"mining on an overpriced laptop"
Gee. I wonder what could go wrong. I'm also assuming you didn't pay for the computer. You WILL fry it.

Hi guys
I find it wonderful that you're taking on this task.
I think that if you guys build in the option to make sure that traders are human (captchas + one minute delay between orders), you could enable some exchanges to try to be bot-free, and try to curb high-frequency trading... And people might like that.

Once again, if the OP wants to be speculating, Bitstamp has way more volume than Kraken...
