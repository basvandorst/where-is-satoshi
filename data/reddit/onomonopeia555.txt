This would cause problems as bicycles are highly prone to not work at all when designed by an engineer with the laws of physics in mind.

Hmm...my bank still uses a DEC-10 mainframe built in 1972 and based off unix. From your statement we should all have unix mainframes in our basements running our glowing green and black terminals. Not quite the case. Just because a business uses a certain tech does not make it automagically trickle down to the common person.

You're thinking of a situation where everyone trusts everyone else that can write to the chain. That only works if bank of America trusts that MA and PA credit union Inc llc first bank of podunk Maine really does have the check for $850billion from Jims uncle Mr. Richard U. Pennybags. This is not the case. BoA needs some assurance that these little no name banks really can clear this money and are not simply a rogue bank manager trying to make off with enough to live like a king in Tahiti.
  
  
This is why we have the current slower system of ACH and SWIFT, the clearing house collects all the transactions, verifies and batches them. This way instead of 7 million transactions each moving individual minor amounts from account to account across banks, you do it once a day. All the transactions get added together by bank and each bank gets its credit and debit total. It is each banks individual responsibility to get it to the correct place. This used to be done by funny little men with glasses, pencils and adding machines. Now the funny little men drink martinis and light cigars with $100 bills because they taught the adding machines to do it on their own.  
  
This is why in a situation where you don't trust anyone else (permissionless, anyone can claim anything they want) and decentralized (there is nobody you can go to and say "hey is this guy full of shit?" When verifying a transaction) you need some type of proof (maths) that you are not in fact full of shit, maybe a little bit because breakfast was a while ago but you didn't have lunch yet...
