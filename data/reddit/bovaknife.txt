Because it is a scam! I'm only into telling people about scams, not creating them.  What do you call a system where everyone who joins first makes millions and everyone after that looses money.  A FUCKING PYRAMID SCHEME.

No reason to not just jump to the next electronic currency. There are already 10 of them out there and soon there will be 100s. Why stick it out in bitcoin when you can be an "early adopter" in a brand new pyramid scheme.

They all work the same, you can start one tomorrow if you want.  Look at Litecoin or Namecoin or PPcoin.... Get in now on the ground floor for Big profits, tell your friends and bug your family!!!

 Anyone can just make up their own currency. You could start altercatorCoin tomorrow and it has exactly the same qualities as bitcoin does. May as well just jump to the next electronic currency.

You have to fuck the  person above you, and then if you can get 3 people to join they all have to fuck you!  Better hope you are a good salesman.

Bad also, but bitcoin is no better.

I wouldn't do it! Anyone can just make up their own currency. You could start SehrozCoin tomorrow and it has exactly the same qualities as bitcoin does.
