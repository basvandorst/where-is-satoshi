the date is July 27th 2014, then the IPO will end, The shares will be able to be sold by anyone after that date. By then our devices will be finished with development &amp; distributing. We will be releasing 4,500,000,000 Shares by 7/27/2014 giving a 45% public holding of the company. The long term plan is to eventually release 80% of all shares to the public once our machines are worldwide &amp; used.

Bitcoin Kinetics is using Bluetooth LE technology on all of our BitSwitch devices that allow any machine to accept crypto currency from a blockchain. Another great technology that will do much better the Bluetooth is Light Data Transfer,  there are many ways to send data, the most efficient, safest &amp; strongest will win...

Im going to kick ass, and if that site goes away I have 10 billion shares covered by secretary of state in CA and all shareholders email addresses.  That way I can ensure if we get on another exchange, we can have share transfers and such. Im going to make sure everyone gets paid. Thats my goal.

this article is ended in a weak &amp; untruthful manor. The fact is I, as the CEO of Bitcoin Kinetics, employ 5 people who work with their god given human hands building machines. Im planning on employing up to 50,000 people in the next 2 years. I create jobs, and automate the finance &amp; payroll system so there is no CEO or executives stealing the workers shit. So get your story strait before you go venting about my company.

I own StripperCoin.com and have told almost all the strippers in Portland to take Bitcoin. Several Kit Kat Club girls are my Facebook friends. I'm working on getting qr code stickers and card for them as well as a map of all bars and strip clubs that take BTC. I hope I helped influence this progressive move. I also own PDXbar.com if anyone wants to help get more Portland bars on board. I'll put them all on the maps on our future site.

Because I'm building a million things and that's just not been a priority until someone actually takes bitcoin. Its hard to teach a stripper how to accept btc

Im working on it

All of our work is open source, you can download the software sketch we created for the arduino and program it yourself to install into any device you want to be activated by a Bitcoin Payment. We are always interested in bringing in ore people to our company to help develop this idea &amp; technology. I encourage competition &amp; diversity, but the tyrannical CEO in me would say, we will hire everyone who can find happiness in this work, so as to employ the best micro controller engineers &amp; developers on earth, giving our company the best hold on the market. Yet, where is the fun in that? Id be glad to show you how to make these devices yourself as an affiliate of Bitcoin Kinetics or if you feel like you can do all the work and start a competitive company, id encourage either rout.

Bitcoin Kinetics will be glad to help anyone who is struggling with this unfortunate event in any way we can. Thank you for these kind words Mr Voorhees. We Will Endure...

thank you for your support. It sees that the community really wants us to make alot of machines that accept Bitcoin. We already have sold over 2 Million shares in 2 days. The plans of putting Bitcoin accepting devices everywhere is on its way!

Most definitely, thank you so much for your support. I appreciate you all so much, my fellow human beings, I create these Bitcoin outlets for our world to be easier, safer, smarter &amp; better for us all. But I can only do so much as a man before I become exhausted or killed. This work is vital to Bitcoins survival, so it doesn't just need me &amp; Bitcoin Kinetics. It needs you ALL.

Ask him if he wants any Bitcoin operated vending machines, parking meters, transit pass to let machines, gas pumps and atms to be first in California then he has to personally call me and I will make him a deal and contribute to his office. I can make bitcoin machines personally for my home state of California. 6197213384

and i also see the program im working on AXIOMITY having many options to customize the voting parameters of the protocol to give the developers of interactive projects the ability to build anything they desire that needs a voting system with the protocol as something they can connect to.
@_date: 2013-09-08 00:02:42
I love all of you so much my friends. I'm here to ensure we win with cryptocurrency. I thank you all so much for your support. If anyone is ever willing to be apart on my projects I want you all to own and be apart of this work that is more important than me as a man, its important to us all as a species, and I am here for you all until death strikes me down I will fight for all of us bitcoiners until the end. Promise. Mahalo All! &amp; thanks for making me feel apart of the planet again!

This Is An Amazing Article About Bitcoin Education Coming To Reality...
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:39:04
Im open to all systems of voting over decentralized networks including Bitcoin, Mastercoin, ColoredCoins, Transaction Server, Vouchers For Votes, What Ever Works Best. 
Also why is there so much talk of YES &amp; NO Votes only.
Im AM NOT Creating A Binary Voting System, It Is Individual 3 Crypto Currencies YES, NO &amp; NEUTRAL, So there is a debate, dialogue of disagreement, counter party arguments &amp; compromise within a 2/3rds vote. 33% is safer the 50% for consensus.. this is all experimental, so im trying to craft this out properly. Im willing to work with all of you to make this an immediate reality. 
This BitCongress system is a voting protocol, im also building a software program called AXIOMITY that communicates with the BitCongress protocol for voting on &amp; drafting of Legislation, A Law Ranking System, Encrypted Messaging, Taxation &amp; Accounting. This voting protocol can be used, modified, cloned or forked, and adjusted for individual uses by creating your own software package that communicates with the voting protocol and changing application specific details for your specific needs. This allows any country, company, club or organization to interact in any custom way with the BitCongress Voting Protocol. A system of verifying votes that works, is secure &amp; verifiable is the goal, all the other details will be up to you and your software to color the Votecoins in any detailed way you desire other then YES, NO Or Neutral. This gives the user, the developers &amp; the voters a range of use out of one protocol, just as Bitcoin can be filter, modified &amp; distributed in different manors, the BitCongress protocol &amp; VoteCoins can all be labeled and used in any way that can be tallied in the voting system. Im looking for a customization of experience for everyone over a secure standard voting protocol. The hashing power of Bitcoin gives the BitCongress system an advantage with hashing power &amp; network security. Im also planning on creating an altchain as a backup called CongressCoin, it will be either a fork of Litecoin, Primecoin Or Quark. This way if Bitcoin gets destroyed by bankers, voting will still be developed in a decentralized way. Im just thinking out loud and hope you all can help me with this idea. I believe in it passionately.
see some of my other work..

the VoteCoins are a vote token that is mined and verified, with a network of miners, like a crypto currency, a full token will be counted as a 1. There are 3 different types of VoteCoins, Yes, No &amp; Neutral. Each one will be mined, sent, received &amp; verified just like Bitcoin. The use of the yes, no, or neutral VoteCoins will be distinctive to the desired use of the protocol. It could theoretically be used for a system with monetized voting such as, voting with as many votes as you can buy, as well a single vote system with a software program such as AXIOMITY, resetting the network to have 1 of each 3 coins in each wallet every time or returning VoteCoins to address or something to that nature. I see the protocol BitCongress as a voting protocol that can be used in any way imaginable by building on top of it, just like Bitcoin.

i am looking at ways to implement anonymity vote granularity, but have not made any decisions yet
