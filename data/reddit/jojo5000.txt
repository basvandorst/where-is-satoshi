Hyperinflation worldwide is at hand and Gold is maxed out to jump in. So I use Bitcoins (and the miners hardware) to secure at least some value for the time after USD/EUR currencies have died. I also buy tobacco.

Actually this is a very interesting question that arises: What would happen if a county gets isolated/split from the Internet (like what happend in Egypt), but remains an operational countrywide network where volunteers/underground Bitcoin miners can continue to uphold and validate transactions. Will those Bitcoins in the wallets be valid for trading inside this closed network and what happens to the transactions, when the country reconnects back to the internet?

compleatly useless point of us/government regulation panic. nobody cares about possible “know your customer” law regulations outside of us

what always amuses me about this so called "exchanges" or "banks" that appear here: no info on fundings, no contact information, no info on the entepreneur or whatsoever is given on all of thier sites.
who in the real world would ever give money to an anonymous amateur suit he accidentally meet on the street? 
so i don´t trust them at all and don´t use them, till they crawl out of their anonymity black hole.
the only expeption is that new canadian exchange, but they accept only cad.

too expensive, not worth the money.
the 6870 is generally also a bad performer for mining (here max 250 Mh each @ 940/600/90c)

I also thought about the same question from the beginning. I came to the conclusion that Bitcoins ain´t build to replace even a single currency. Especially not in the so called Third World. I think people in Afrika and Asia didn´t even noticed Bitcoins yet. 
What we need is a kind of "Worldcoin", that has enough coins for billions of people plus adopts new and efficient network and storage alghorithms as a guy pointed out here:

when transactionsfees occur regularry and miners proccess/delay the transactions by the numbers they get - bitcoin will just die because it looses its only advantage: no fees for micro transactions. it will be just easiert/cheaper to use paypal or something then again.
