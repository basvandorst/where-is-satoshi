Network hashrate is about 6 billion giga-hash and I've got .3, so there's a 1 in 18 billion chance each block, by my calculation, divided by my fractional difference in latency if I understand correctly. At 144 blocks/day that's 1 in 125 million/day. Or about 1 in 300,000 per year. Which doesn't actually sound so bad. Have I done that right? If so I'm going to solo mine....
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:01:29
yeah true to a degree, but then all prices are "fake" to a degree. I guess what I'm getting at is that by the time 20x confirms are "actually" found the price I would have gotten will most likely be shite so it's not literally "the same as 20 confirms to trade" as you say; confirms are going on all the time and more and more people are trading away bcc off the back of 1 confirm on viaBTC and the price is dropping and dropping. I get what you're saying, and it's true but the reality is delayed. If you get me?
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:10:07
Yeah I think so too...profitability is around 1.09x for bch right now according to fork.lol and that's surely within the variation of the tx fee reward + btc/bch price fluctuation. 
So it doesn't matter which coin you're mining. Except, if it doesn't matter, which one are you going to choose? 
...what I don't understand is that if the miner can't claim the reward until 100 blocks post their discovery have been mined, "profitability" is a projection of the momentary price 100 blocks into the future. I.e., the miner doesn't know what price they're going to be getting in 100 blocks time.  
So which coin do you choose, now? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:42:07
I would presume that we need to move our coins to segwit addresses to be able to load a LN channel? Is there a "segwit wallet" yet, like electrum or mycelium?   
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:56:53
so with 14m coins in circulation, the price would drop by the same fraction as those newly found: 1/14, or about 7% lower than today, or about $200. It'd hardly be noticeable. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:10:29
Well. They should. Everyone with BTC was exposed to the potential risk of the fork, everyone with BTC should get their reward to do with as they please - hedge against bcash becoming the main coin, or dump for free. Either way it's part of the package you purchased when you brought a coin that can be forked.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:26:53
I think either you or I have the wrong end of the stick.  That's btc:bcc prices they're quoting. 0.12 of a bitcoin. Or ~300usd. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:55:04
Well fuck it. I probably would've if I'd got round to it. *Just* as a type got the confirm for my transaction. the mempool was relatively big and it looks like that confirmation was what a lot of people were waiting on to sell...price has dropped again. And I just sold for 0.13 and I'm expecting a crash. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:15:51
It's going up? I see less than $600
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:58:47
I completely agree; I think that the world in which one bitcoin is worth 50,000,000 doesn't really exist for that reason. Way before that point, bitcoin is just the accepted method of payment.
Of course, the world in which one bitcoin is worth whatever the equivalent of $50,000,000 would have been, provided bitcoin *does* become the currency of the future, will almost certainly exist, as there's a limit to the number of bitcoin that exist.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:25:32
Sats are kind of shit for Western mind thinking as it's not in the 10^(3*n) rule. So mBtc and ubtc are 10^-3 and 10^-6 and thousand and million and billion are 10^3 and 10^6 and 10^9. Of cpurse they just follow the SI rule like every other sensible metric. And sats are like 10^8? 7? I always forget. Rather 1 sat were 1 nanoBTC, itd be easier to remember and caqlpcualte, but we're stuck with it now. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:20:15
To add to that, it doesn't really help that if you Google "what Bitcoin fee should I use" you get  which always "recommends" the lowest fee with 0 block delay. They're not *wrong* but it's an understatement to say that there's a huge lack of nuance when the fees they "recommend" are 10x the fee thats regularly getting on a block.   
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:55:36
I'm not certain about this idea so you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong, but from a security perspective, if fees were 0.1cent/tx, I could split a value transfer over many transactions and it'd be more secure, no? And I'm less willing to do that, or to split as much, if fees are higher.

I don't know what's going to happen re mycelium - not sure it's still being developed. Looking forward to electrum being capable. I'll move my funds over as soon as the fees come down to something reasonable...
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:50:00

Essentially we need segwit gui wallets asap. Hardly anyone's using segwit atm so as of now it's status quo re number of txs in a block. Give it time.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:36:37
not as precise as joseph, but I've been using  and just looking at which colour's being "eaten" each time a block comes in. If I really want it in I pick the colour above and if not I pick the last one that's being consumed by the miner monster.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:37:53
Would I also be correct in suggesting that funding LN channels will only be possible from segwit addresses?

Is it a good idea for me to be getting work from Perth when I'm in the UK? I think I'll just set my own up!
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:10:06
I should also add that the bitfees21 site is better in that it does show you which fee levels are waiting for how many blocks. It could still do with a bit of nuance.
 I know you're right about the statistical point, after all it's just maths, but I think the sites aren't giving the whole picture. They're erring on the side of caution, not telling people the variances, probably because people getting their txs stuck sucks, they're outputting the minimum fee that would "guarentee" getting on. ("," because nobody can predict the future).
 Obviously this isn't a problem with electrum and resending txs with higher fees if needs be, which is why I'm very in favour of low-balling. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:27:07
There's always going to be someone with that story. And the likelihood is you'll hear about that story rather than the majority who are now selling at .13

That's cool! What happens if LN gets so large that people never really need to settle, so they set the timelock to years, and on-chain transactions become incredibly rare? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:33:33
Yes there's a jam because of the fight. Btc difficulty is, right now at least, set to come down in about 2 weeks, as miners are on bch. In about 30 mins the difficulty of bch goes up, miners will switch back to btc, and the mempool should clear a little as Sunday traffic is lighter. Hopefully fees come down tomorrow. Hopefully a segwit gui wallet comes around soon and the switchover to segwit elevates more pressure before lightning networks come in and these sorts of posts disappear forever.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:34:16
So how would they do that? Just only generate segwit addresses for receiving coin from now on, and display the total balance as non-segwit+segwit addresses in the wallet? What about sending? Does it try to empty the non-segwit addresses first, or does it use the segwit addresses first as they'll be a bit cheaper?  
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:25:20
The miners collect the fees and the blocks reward.
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:33:12
Maybe I'm missing something but for me the problem is with edas that drop the difficulty so low that blocks are found faster than the network can transmit them which (this is where I'm uncertain) means many orphaned blocks. Many orphaned blocks means loss of profit, and if the orphan rate is higher than the difference in profitability between the two chains I think it's effectively end-game...but I'm having trouble thinking about what happens in that scenario.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:51:16
I transacted my BTC to a new wallet and imported the old wallet keys to a VM electrum wallet. The transaction in which I moved my BTC is showing up in electrum (I thought it wouldn't!), though it's "unconfirmed". Can you tell me whats going on there? 
Cheers  
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:06:52
Op divides the block rewards $ by the number of txs in the block and says that's the "fee". It's a strange way of putting it to say the least.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:37:04
Re the oscillation being 20% less: do you mean the accuracy of the adjustment in its "aim" of bringing (close to) profitability parity to the two chains?  Or 20% of an "effect" on btc in terms of the transaction times? Either way I hope you're right. And yeah, totally with you on the cold storage holders. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:09:41
Looking at that fee estimator you link, it's recommending 199 sat/B for even &lt;24 block confirm. Which is, right now, complpete bollocks. 30-40 will very well get you in. Just looking at jochen  mempool stats page is a much better way of seeing what's going on. 
Edit: yeah it's a load of shit. Pretty well every 20-30 sat/B tx went in the latest block. And the fee estimator is *still* saying 199 sat/B for a &lt;24 block confirm. Wtf?
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:23:04
kind of yes and no, as I can lock-in the amount btc I'm (hopefully, eventually) going to receive by trading after 1 confirm of my bcc transaction - that bcc shows up on my viaBTC balance and I can trade away and now I've got btc balance and nothing else. Put another way: If they wouldn't let me trade my bcc before it was 20x confirmed, then yeah, but they actually let you trade after 1x confirm. So my btc balance is there, but I can't withdraw it until 20 confirms on the initial bcc transfer. It depends what you mean by "get out" - I'm "out" regards bcc, but not "out" regards viaBTC. It's a soft "out". (I won't consider myself fully "out" until the coins are in my master seed) 
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:29:50
Perhaps, but only once in a year or so. If you connect to a sufficiently well-connected hub then you should be able to change fiat to bitcion loaded directly on to your channel, so no worries about defunding your channel and needing to start a new one. Just leave it open.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:20:10
"It" in my comment refers to the EDA.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:45:01
Interesting. Can you "manually" settle early? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:18:50
Are there different ways of telling a channel to settle-up? Like: "once 100mBTC has been spent, send it to the blockchain"
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:52:20
No doubt whatsoever that the answer they get is the right one for the calculation they've performed.
What's clear from looking at the charts is that the calculation they're performing is the wrong one!
&lt;24 block confirm and it's saying 200 sats/B. That's so wrong it hurts.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:29:50
It's difficult to tell at this early stage. But it doesn't look any different this time around, yet. 
Last time the difficulty on BCH dropped the BTC mempool grew about 10MB in the first 12 hours. Right now, about 30 minutes to go for 12 hours since the BCH difficulty drop, and I think the BTC mempool's grown about 10MB...Could be just different times of day. Strange, overall, considering BTC's profitability is apparently higher than BCH. What are the selfish miners doing, because we're running a bit slow on the chain? Are they waiting for the fees to go up, and BCH just gives them something to do in the meantime?
I'm using "MB growth" as the starting positions of each weren't the same, but to be honest the fees aren't that much different. 
EDIT: scratch that about the fees - I'm wrong - we're still doing ok on the fee front.

@_date: 2017-08-27 02:59:04
I think we're slowly realising that centralisation in some form is, one way or another, inevitable. At least LN avoids full-node centralisation *as well* - even big blocks need LN too, eventually, it simply doesn't scale on-chain. Period. No debate. You can move the date you have to do it, but eventually you have to do L2. And once you realise that, you realise you may as well do it now, with small blocks. You release an 8MB block into the ecosystem, eventually it gets full and you're writing TB HDDS every year. It's bad enough trying to run a full node with 1MB blocks, let's not let it get any worse just to put-off implementing something we're going to have to implement anyway.

Quite right. Without any utility, bitcoin is just a nice implementation of math. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:29:39
No, that one's bollocks too. Its recommending 360 sat/B for guarantee of being in tbe next block. Even being extravagant, you can see that 100 would be way more than enough from looking at that jochen site. I'm finding it hard to describe, in sort-of "algorithmic" terms, what I'm looking for when I choose a fee from jochen graph, but my point is that essentially it's very very easy to give it a glance and see which colours are getting cometely eliminated, which colours occasionally get chunks taken out, but are growing over the blocks. Etc.  
Edit: really, it's so much more informative to look at the jochen graph. You can see that, for example, unless you're willing to pay &gt;200 sats/B you're likely no better off paying more than 30 - looking at the last 8 hours the max wait periods for 30 have been about 5 blocks, but then txs under 200 were waiting almost as long as well. It really gives you a good view of what the current state of the mempool and mining is like.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:07:05
So there'd be 1/14th more in "circulation", so the price would move 1/14th lower to reflect that? Am I missing something, because that doesn't seem "huge" compared to e.g., the amount the price has shifted in the last two months.
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:15:04
With greenaddress I have the slight concern that if a fork happens I won't be able to access my coins on the alt and get my free money. I'm not pro alt, I just want a wallet that lets me do that. I'm not certain its not possible with greenaddress,I just read something on their site that gave me that impression. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:14:08
I always envisioned the logical conclusion of LN would be large, trusted hubs with which a user would open a payment channel worth whatever their monthly spend would be.  
I might not understand LN, so please excuse me if im wrong: The coin limit for transactions through a mesh is whatever was funded into the smallest channel on the path, or paths, right? I'd rather fund a chanel I *know* has connectivity and a LN connected balance larger than whatever I might want to spend, or receive. And so would every other user, no? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:21:15
Viabtc wanted my passport number and name but I didn't have to upload a scan or anything. I've already traded my bcc for btc, it only waits 1 confirm before your trade is locked in,  but it'll take 20 confirms total on my initial bcc transfer before I can  withdraw the btc.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:40:31
Good question! For example, whilst I'd opt to receive into segwit 100% of the time, I'd probably prefer to spend my legacy, especially during low-fee periods. 
Though to be honest, it might be academic: I'll probably just wait for a low fee period and flip everything into segwit.

Maybe in the future when bitcoin's worth is up they'll lower the threshold? Maybe they'll become a LN hub and you'll be able to withdraw through an intermediary?
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:38:48
Well, you can get out of bcc -trading is allowed after 1 confirm- but you can't get your btc out of viabtc before your bcc is confirmed with 20 blocks. If 20 blocks get mined...
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:57:40
Thanks for that info, I didn't have the technical knowledge to understand quite what it was you couldn't do, but it put me off. For me, I want my keys to be able to get whatever flavour fork-coin comes along - the ability to make a fork is part of bitcoin, and I should get the benefits of that as much as I'm exposing myself to the risk by investing.     
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:03:13

@_date: 2017-08-30 09:28:19
Sounds shit...but....what it does mean is that it would be **very** cheap to be Billy big bollocks hub in a LN. I've only got about .15 BTC but I could probably hub for a few hundred people. A few people with a few 100s of BTC now...
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:05:41
Yup, you needed a $6 fee to get your tx in around then. Bitcoins essentially unusable *right now*, but also as of right now, virtually nothing else is widely accepted. I'm sorry to have to say it, and I know it's no use to you *right now* but the long-term scaling issues are being worked on as we speak, and you're transacting in the worst period for about a week, so in the medium-term "be patient". 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:02:00
I've got an answer to my own question: on electrum; Tools&gt;Network&gt; uncheck "select server automatically" , server tab&gt; right-click "electrum-abc.cripto..." and click "use as server". Then it sync'd and now I'm sending to viaBTC.  And waiting for confirm..........
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:47:14
Right, but surely it's better to implement segwit and LN and then see what block size you need once they're in place? 
Or do you think we need to increase adoption first by increasing the blocksize right now such that enough people get on board and LN becomes usable? I guess if LN needs lots of users before its worthwhile then I get what you're saying. But it still doesn't hurt to put segwit and LN in place right now and "see what happens". 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:29:36
Oh well bugger, I got .13 for mine. Now just have to wait for 18 more confirms on the bcc in transaction before I'm allowed to withdraw....
TBH I think they're completely right about the price being high due to the confirm time: superimpose price against mempool - it dropped right after that ~10hr block got found.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:22:48
Well I don't have a problem advising my friends, because I wouldn't advise them to do foolish shit. 1. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. 2. Keep your private keys. 3. Buy a few little amounts first to see how it works. 4. Keep buying in smaller chunks - it hedges you against price fluctuations and you can see how you feel about drops without too-much invested before you go all-in. 5. Keep tabs on the community - forks especially - try to see through the bullshit.
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:55:31
It's a nonsense. The block reward halving is going to happen sooner, so the profitability drops, but all that means is that a *even* lower difficulty is required before it's profitable again. Even if people sell their BCH and the price plummets, that just means a lower difficulty is required before mining's profitable again...There's nothing to do about that *except*...eventually the difficulty drops so low that blocks get found at a higher rate than the network can propagate them, right? So doesn't that give us a huge problem with orphans, and the "profitability" has to factor that in. And you can't factor that in to a difficulty drop, you've fucked yourself. The real-terms profitability has just effectively dropped, but the difficulty's already so low - indeed that's what's causing the problem with the orphans - so you can't drop it further. There's a concrete floor to how low the difficulty can go given the hashpower we've got available to come on to the chain.   
@_date: 2019-08-11 23:04:50
Investing is the prudent logical smart thing to do partly because of inflation. 
If money stays the same value over time then keeping hold of your money as money would be the safest way to hold value - you would neither lose nor gain, but at least it would be safe. By having inflation, that balance between “safe” and “holding value” shifts things towards investment as an option - it’s more risky than keeping it in a bank, but it might even gain value over time. Certainly you’re going to be losing money by keeping it as money.

Yeah that's a good point about the "actual" circulating coins vs the coins "available" vs the total number of coins that have been mined so far. It's quite intriguing: Does the wallet still exist? Was it lost forever? Surely the temptation of a few billion would be too much? I suppose satoshi is *still* richer than midas, regardless. But it'd be interesting to know...

So long as we’re all consistent - electrum and jochens mempool site and whichever blockchain viewer - it doesn’t really matter. Except that it’s more difficult to see if it’s preceded by a load of zeros.
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:57:29
The electrum client fixed this, but it was severely annoying for a while. Sats/byte should be the unit we all use, but even then the sat not conforming to the 10^3 naming convention is a bit annoying.
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:06:20
Agreed. You can see the daily rise and fall, use the MB chart to filter the fee level until you’ve got about 1MB on the graph, you can pretty easily “hop” on to a cheap block if there’s a lucky period. And with the ability to resend with a higher fee it’s fairly risk-free if you want to low-ball it and leave a transaction in the mempool overnight or something. 
It takes about 30 seconds to get a good reading of where you need to place your fee using Jochens Mempool page, I’d really recommend it to anyone over any of these fee-estimators.
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:05:44
I think, like a miner collects the transaction fees, someone who runs a LN "hub" can charge a small amount (obviously less than a transaction fee) to facilitate a transaction. It's been a while since I looked in to LN tech so I'm probably a bit off whack, but that's the gist of it.
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:07:50
Any idea how much they can collect? 
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:17:49
How much of a cut do they get?
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:06:35
False. It depends on the service you sign up for and whether it’s a debit or credit or amex card.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:22:30
I kind of imagine that if you haven’t set a fee to go with it then it’s not going to be charging a fee? Wouldn’t that be an option in the setup? What if your channel just gets defunded? I totally haven’t worked this thing out at all.......
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:08:39
So when you setup a node you don’t set a useable fee with it? 
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:08:56
Right, but that would happen organically if they'd just left it alone.
Miners switch to BCH --&gt; BTC mempool fills --&gt; fees compete to be in top 1MB --&gt; block reward goes up --&gt; miners switch back.
I'd rather whoever did this put their spare BTC to developing lightning networks and getting gui segwit wallets out.
 
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:43:03

I think economists are generally of the opinion that bubbles are difficult to see until they pop. You're defending Bitcoin is based on specuplation: you're speculating that the technology and future potential are what's underpinning the price. I don't necessarily disagree but:
What people look for when they're looking for bubbles are things like social hype, "it'll be different this time", memes, media attention, and massive price rises. They don't necessarily care about the fundamentals, or future potential, or about understanding the technology. Even if they did understand it, they might well still call it a bubble. Check r/buttcoin for such folks. 
The other thing to bear in mind is that bubbles necessitate people such as yourself really honestly believing that they're not in a bubble. Now, we might actually not be in a bubble, and Bitcoin might well actually "be different this time". I think it *could* be. But the first piece of advice given whenever somebody posts here asking questions about investing is always "don't invest more than you can afford to lose". And the unspoken subtext to that is "we might be in a bubble".

You're right. Bubbles are hard to spot until they pop. The fundamentals are most importantly the devs when it comes down to it. The future potential is what the vast manority of people are buying Bitcoin for, and that comes down to what the devs can achieve technologically. First blockchain itself...a number of improvements e.g., segwit, then hopefully a working LN, then it's down to us in the media and social media and word of mouth, to pressure shops and businesses to accept and pay in Bitcoin. 
But yeah, a healthy dev team is the most important thing to assess.

I think the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin prevents it from replacing fiat. Greshams law (bad money replaces good) means that we should always hold our Bitcoin and trade in whatever else is accepted. I've yet to find anyone who can convince me that Bitcoin is immune to this. Which means that Bitcoin can only ever represent a "store of value " more akin to gold than fiat. That shouldn't detract from Bitcoin; it's a far more advanced store of value than gold - I can buy and sell it much more easily, and with whoever I please. But I'd be foolish to buy a coffee with it, over fiat, when tomorrow it's more rare and worth more and my fiat is worth less.

I'm with thewumbles; we see the potential that bitcoin has to be used in place of fiat, and what that would mean for the value, and I'd rather quietly invest as much as I'm barely able to afford before the big boys blow this thing apart more than they already have.

I've got a very noob question: I've got a bit of coin in my electrum wallet and a bit of coin on mycelium on android. Do I need to do anything to make sure my coins aren't worthless?

Can I chime in here with a question: How does spamming work to the advantage of the spammer? 
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:13:44
OK, thanks for that. Eventually I'll want to transact. Let's say I wait a bit for the dust to settle: Will electrum or mycelium then automatically determine on which chain I'm transacting?

Question: I can't open port 8333 for...reasons... Is there any point me running a full node? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:40:37
So is that because the big blockers want large blocks to be the solution to the transaction volume problem rather than segwit and lightning networks? 
And the big blockers want that because...?...it keeps the mining fee rather than LN transactions which would be fee-less??
Or are big blocks just a proposal in opposition to segwit because segwit stops ASICBOOST?
Sorry for my ignorance!

Just did this - from 400mb to 4000 and sync estimate went down from 3 weeks to 7 days (and still falling).
EDIT: checked back a few minutes later and sync estimate is down to 17 hours
