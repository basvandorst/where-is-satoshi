Gambling does not mean that to the average person. If a slot machine only payed out a jackpot of $0.50  noone would every play them.

At least 1/4 of customers I encounter make some kind of mistake with their cards. Usually pulling out early. Maybe 5% put the card in wrong. Last week a lady put her card in upside down and backwards and after getting it in right pulled out early 3 times.
EDIT: My job inherently puts me in contact with a lot old people so my sample may not be representative of the population at large.

I'm not a troll, but I'm also not invested in Bitcoin. One of my friends put in his life savings at around 17k (when it went mainstream). I find the culture around Bitcoin interesting, but I have no money invested either way.
I just don't think the average person could explain how a car or computer or even a light works any better than they could Bitcoin.

Are cars mainstream? Pick an average Joe and have them explain to me how the engine in the car works. When I had neighbors coming over to ask me what I think of Bitcoin (neighbors who needed help setting up a router), I'd say it had gone mainstream.

But that's exactly my point. It's not possible to enforce the rulings on judge Judy which is why the producers pay. The defendant gets a free trip and doesn't have to pay anything for their crimes.

Thanks I'll check that out.

Recommended readings or even first names?
I guess I don't see how a system without a unified police, court, or prison system could enforce any rules or laws whatsoever. And I'm just not confident that a society could exist without laws.
There is a world of difference to me between low taxes and small government vs no taxes and no government.

But they charge everyone that even if they don't pay with a card.

Can you explain to me how that would work?  How do you privately contract a court to hear a case? How do private citizens contract a sufficient military? Who pays to maintain roads and bridges? What happens if you find someone unconscious outside and don't know which ambulance service (if any) they are contracted to?

You are right, at least for me. I subscribed to this subreddit to sort of keep track of prices just to know what's going on with people in my life. A friend of mine got very into Bitcoin and spent all of his savings on it and took out loans to rent office space and equipment to mine Bitcoin. I think even true believers would see that as a terrible investment.  He also got a lot of his family to invest pretty heavily.
I had some close family friends lose a huge amount of money in the dotcom bubble and they still haven't recovered financially or emotionally. They have no retirement savings left. One of them has attempted suicide a few times since (although there are other factors, money and the divorce that came with the crash are contributors).
As someone who doesn't believe in Bitcoin, it's hard to see people I care about risking so much on it.  Crypto seems like a great thing conceptually, but practically I don't think we are ready for it yet and I think a lot of people are going to get hurt in the mean time. If I'm wrong, I'll be happy. My friends and family will be okay (more than okay) and we will have a great technology. But in the mean time, Bitcoin is upsetting to me because I don't want to see bad things happen to people.
