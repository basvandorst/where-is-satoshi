When it touches 14k it might as well just keep going and touch 16k and correct down to 14k. Trading is a huge risk.

It is actually laughable that you believe this. You claim to be an investor but doesn't seem to be able to grasp what a stupidly insane statistic that is.

It's almost as if they are different people
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:38:36
Whales going at it again
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:34:26
If this number is the corrected value then I'll be a happy camper

Seems like most people are shitting themselves but honestly this is nothing weird at all. Nothing points to this being a negative development for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:45:51
I'm willing to bet that we will go right
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:11:55
Impossible to predict, but basing on trend, we're going for another spike, probably a new high
@_date: 2019-06-08 00:30:48
How so?
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:43:08
Neat, thanks for the info
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:46:18
Very true
Thanks mate

I wonder what the chances that Bitcoin fails and goes to 0 are. Always feels very risky to invest more and more
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:33
Both were down for me

Without hodlers the price would be very low. They don't influence the short term, but they influence the long term more than anyone.

Isn't the pro coinbase fee like 0.15% or something?
@_date: 2019-06-04 06:05:51
I think I'd rather just take the hit at that point damn
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:33:50
I'm really interested in how the fuck you figure that
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:50:42
And support fiat? *Disgusting*
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:23:51
Nice, I will. How are the fees?
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:14:11
I doubt sometimes but never feel stupid for it. I'd feel stupid if I missed this Bitcoin train though.
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:15:34
Never used bisq, I'm assuming it's good?
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:41:43
We'll be able to buy two Deloreans by then
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:44:58
Both my mother and brother has invested now. There's something very influencial about Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:25:43
The lower the dip, the uglier the chicks
@_date: 2019-06-05 00:04:28
How could they drain everything with just a link? Did you have a wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:49:05
Terrible comparison. This is theft. If someone robs you, you don't consider it a lesson that you shouldn't walk around with your wallet, you go to the police and make a report.
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:41:50
Me: Bitcoin is going to 100k by the end of today
Not very hard is it?
