Still, when you think about it: 252 transactions costs 0.7454 BTC in fees, and creates 12.5 of BTC.

Craig Wright does seem to support bigger block sizes as the primary means of scaling bitcoin

Thanks for the comments. Yes, I am a newbie, which also makes me less emotionally attached to bitcoin. I know that there is ongoing R&amp;D on scaling bitcoin, and it is very possible that bitcoin will be able  to support large volume of transactions with low fees, but this is years away. If it happens, it is not going to be *soon*.  The common advice I see on this sub is to buy bitcoins and sit on them, but in order for bitcoin to go mainstream it has to be used. That is how the market works, without movement it is dead. That advice people give to sit on bitcoin does not make it more popular.

I am new to bitcoin, and after this weekend I understood that all these claims about bitcoin soon going mainstream, about Amazon accepting bitcoin as a form of payment, about bitcoin replacing money are simply false. The reality is that bitcoin today cannot be used as a form of payment. Bitcoin today is a game that some people are willing to play, but it is not a useful currency.

It probably made sense at a time to re-target difficulty when no one really used bitcoin. Now, the dynamics of the bitcoin network changes constantly, and having such slow adjustment is suboptimal. The BCH team is deploying today the per-block difficulty adjustment algorithm. We'll see how it is going to perform.

It also shows its weakness.  Dollar is strong because you go to a store and pay the same price for goods for weeks, and wait a few seconds for the transaction to go through. The fact that BTC can be so easily attacked and the network can get to almost a halt  with users waiting hours and days for a transaction to go through shows the weakness of the coin. The BTC team needs to think hard to make the network more resilient to these kind of attacks.

Yes, so it was in 1993 and in 1994.  I am not saying bitcoin will never be usable, but as of today this sub is full of links to false claims made by people who have no clue how bitcoin works that bitcoin is going mainstream. Bitcoin may go mainstream in six to eight years.
