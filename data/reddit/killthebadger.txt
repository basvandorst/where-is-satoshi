More garbage posts.

I apologize. I assumed you were someone else I was commenting to. My first comment to you was just trying to bust your balls, because I would like know where you get your .05 valuation from.

Nice job sourcing your reddit comment with a reddit comment.

Wait, are you a virgin? It makes so much sense now.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:58:25
Are you pulling numbers out of your ass again?
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:21:34
I am fully aware of that. I was replying to the fact that you seem to think that op expects to start an exchange with just $50,000 and not at least a million.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:55:33
Someone else stole it.
Practical joke??

The idea is that the 50k is only part of the money needed to get started, Dipshit. If you get enough people to kick in enough money for a million dollars THEN you are off to a good start. 
You take your beta company around to some venture capitalists and if it looks good, people will suck your dick just for the opportunity to give you a hand job.
We all know that BTC is here to stay, and investors with real money will want to have a part in polishing a diamond in the rough, and getting in on the ground floor.

You are a retard.
This is Sparta.

I didn't. Neat.

Defcon is using this recent stir up over malleability as a convenient excuse to abscond with a few million in BTC. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:16:06
Is it true though? That's the problem with this sub. Y'all get offended at the hint of even the slightest push back. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 01:11:24
Case in point. Thanks, buddy.
Edit, oh and also I've been in since before MT. Gox went down. I support bitcoin to an extent, but getting bent out of shape over something like this is petty. 
Some folks may just not know how much energy is involved. I think that YOU are reading the negative connotations into this. Outside of the context that you are reading it in, it is just an interesting factoid, and the correct response is to point out the benefits instead of acting like a kid whose parents unfairly put him in the corner. You know like a mature, confident individual.

Bitcoin doesn't need a hero.

Yeah, but I thought we were talking about bazaar, being used for legal and illegal purposes. I never brought up the protocol. 
Edit: I see where you are confused. Bazaar is not a protocol like bittorrent or http. It's a provider like the Pirate Bay.

I'm not so sure about the government. But PayPal will sell that info to 3rd parties.
@_date: 2016-09-17 21:40:36
So maybe i am misunderstanding. Openbazaar is a protocol like http, or bittorrent? 
Ok so I just read your site, and it seems like it is similar to limewire or something. You provide a client that connects to other clients. 
So I am wrong, but I must add, I am not critical of your site in the least, I fully support this idea, but it is naive to think that if something illegal is done using this *protocol*, the authorities wont try to rope the developers into some of the blame.
As far as my concern for you... I hope I am completely wrong, because I think it would be awesome if this site facilitates selling legal and illegal items. This is something that we really need.

I get what you are saying but tell that to torrent site operators or kimdotcom
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:59:17
I'm trying to understand your point, but I don't.
Bitcoin is valued in cash right? This is important if you are investing in it as a store of value. If you just use it as a form of currency, then they buying power fluctuates because it is still valued in cash.
Are you saying that if the government banned trading in coin, the government would bail out the rich folks who have invested in it?
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:37:01
Many rich folks own dollars and stocks too, but the government manipulates them all the time.

I bet he moon-walked all over that room.

Thanks a lot coinbase. Bastards.
