you can either....
1 - Find a large old school investor who is always looking for more if it doesnt move the market.  These guys exist.
2 - An off-market or "darkpool" exchange where people like your protagonist are connected anonymously with people like described in 
3 - Do it actually legally, declare the gain and pay taxes on it.  He'd still wind up with a stupid amount of money and would be able to use exchanges and not have to worry about the IRS, etc.
4 - No need to actually convert it all until you need to. There are also ways to essentially fund debit cards or gift certificates with Bitcoin, so he could also spend it over time by using a tiny amount of bitcoin to buy a gift cards and pre-paid debit cards.  With that many bitcoin, it would probably gain value at a greater rate than it's being spent.

What major unregulated exchanges are left?  All the major players I can think of(including chinese exchanges now) do KYC/AML on all government currency outflows.

You're looking at it like an interested party rather than a government bureaucrat.  Interested parties see the time limit as a worst-case scenario, the other side sees it as their first serious deadline. 
There is no incentive or advantage for them to do anything other than respond on the last day, and imagine if they approve it in 1/3rd their allocated time and then later it blows up in their face and people accuse them of rushing through the discovery process.

Fees from all the transactions included in a block are paid to the miner who found the block as a bonus on top of the 12.5btc  block reward of "new" bitcoins.  
tl;dr Fees are given to the miner, not burned.

That's certainly what it looks like.  
Do you think something like this would ever be refunded?  Miner clearly knows who overpaid.
