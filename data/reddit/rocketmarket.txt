Absolutely.  What's going on here is that a possible representative is asking Bitcoin what it needs.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:33:06
So you would ask for a candidate to be against all regulation whatsoever?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:09:28
Can you be more specific about how that's to be done?  Because keeping the government from touching something isn't as easy as just saying "no."
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:22:31
*open mining based on community-based projects.
*open source architecture
*probably no premining
*a way to make sure that nobody is abusing the system
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:20:43
So you think it would be a good idea to require a maximum involuntary hash rate?  How would you distinguish the voluntary from involuntary participants?
Wouldn't everyone mining lead to some fairly enormous electricity expenditures?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:09:48
Can you be more specific about how that's to be done?  Should there be no regulation or taxation of bitcoin whatsoever?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:13:09
Okay, but what does "don't touch" mean?  No taxes?  Should there be fraud charges when people declare fraud?  What about theft?  Should bitcoin mining companies have to have fire insurance?
What should be done about the BTC that the FBI stole from Silk Road?  Stuff like that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:50:19
Are you familiar with the case?
Asset forfeiture is one of the biggest problems in American jurisprudence.  It is absolutely something that should be discussed and reformed.
An enormous amount of the BTC taken from Silk Road was not part of any criminal enterprise, and more to the point, it has appreciated in value to the point where it is quite plausibly equal to the FBI's yearly budget.
So if they're keeping all of it, I say we keep their budget this year. 
If they're not keeping it, then I want to either give that money back, use it for other programs, or literally destroy it so that it won't affect the rest of everybody's BTC.
At every step of the way I'd like to direct attention to Ross Ulbricht's case and maybe even get him the heck out of jail someday.
Stuff like that.  Big, important, incredibly interesting stuff.  This is what politics is about.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:26
The thing is that it's already regulated, and it's the difference between doing it badly and doing it well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:29:13
It's an interesting idea.  How much do you think the rest of the community would be interested in a max hash rate?  
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:35:47
Go class of '93!
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:18:57
I don't think we're really communicating here.  There's no way to "not touch it," because, if nothing else, bitcoin miners have to obey fire codes.  They already have to have fire insurance, in order to "not touch it," we'd have to repeal laws and building codes.
I don't know if it's possible to say "Bitcoin should not be taxed at all," because that massively privileges people who use Bitcoin.  You'd pretty much have to repeal all taxes to not tax Bitcoin, and as much as I would enjoy that, I think that's well outside the purview of a single House Representative.
However, if there's anything you can mention that can be worked towards, perhaps in a way that the government is *already* touching Bitcoin that you would prefer it not, I'd be happy to discuss it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:11:09
How would it be possible to regulate mining appropriately?  I assume there should be more emphasis on getting rid of fraud and providing appropriate electricity than anything directly taxing mining...  
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:15:19
I agree that installing mining software on other people's computers is garbage, but I'd be very worried about my ability to write a law banning it. Can you express that in a way that would ban mining without banning anything else by accident?
I'd be very worried about the government running a centralized system, and I don't see any way they can run a decentralized system.  Should the government mine?
Should the government have a coin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:46:53
This makes me sad, because I wanted Occupy to be the real Occupy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:35:48
Hmm.  Let's look at it another way.
Let's say the US Government were to issue a cryptocurrency.  What characteristics do you think it should have?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:21:46
I think you have me confused with somebody that has power over the American government.  I'm just trying to find campaign issues for a candidate to run on.
If the American government ever asks me what I think, I'll be sure to pass your message along.  But that's really not what I'm asking questions about here.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:51:00
You're completely wrong about Silk Road, and your attitude is pointlessly hostile. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:01:34
Stop trying to guess what I'm doing and just have a conversation with me already.
Silk Road was a lot more than just a criminal enterprise, not all the BTC seized from it came from criminal activity, certainly not all of it was proven in a court of law to have been related, the issues with seizure have already been outlined, and for a guy who doesn't want the government touching Bitcoin you're awful cavalier about the BTC that they've already touched -- as well as the person they've imprisoned for life on trumped-up charges that were never proven.
Saying that all activity on Silk Road is criminal would be like seizing every dollar traveling through eBay because somebody sold off-brand Beanie Babies.  It wasn't, and it certainly wasn't proven to be.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:40:17
You're not really getting what I'm saying.  Let's make it very specific.
The FBI stole an enormous amount of Bitcoin from Silk Road.  They still have it right now.  What should be done with it?
This is something that a legislator can do something about.  What should be done?
I don't want polemics, cliches or slogans.  What should be done?  What should a legislator say about the BTC that the FBI has?

If we're just talking about whether Thomas Edison was good or bad, I have two things to add:
1.  He was friends with the guy that owned the railroad so he had special dispensation to ride on the front of locomotives, on top of the cattle catcher.  This is how he would travel.  He said it was quieter and the air was better.  So just imagine a train coming around the corner with Thomas Edison sitting on the  front.
2.  I know it was before such things were thought of, but his chemical-heavy method of experimentation caused toxic messes that killed people at the time and continue to be enormous pollution problems even to this day.  Just a couple years ago they had to shut down a high school football field in Northern New Jersey because they found a bunch of his old lab equipment buried in the landfill beneath it.
So there you go.  Weigh those facts in the balance.
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:17:58
Stop for a second and think about what you're saying there.
Completely unproven allegations, coming from sources that were later proven to be wildly unethical, were used in a criminal sentencing.
That's as unjust as it gets.  Don't carry water for that.
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:30:36
I knew Ross.  I guess I still know him, though I doubt he's still the same person I knew.
I never for a second bought the "hired killer" story, and it's upsetting to hear people still talking about it like it's a fact when it was never anything but a lie.

I look forward to your various screeds against the American occupation of Afghanistan and our pharmaceutical industry.

An interesting case where the packaging is the logo.

He must be guilty because fools on the internet!
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:42:05
He never did that.  The FBI smeared him with that because they wanted their case to look better.  It's been dropped, the people who accused him are in jail for the love of god, and the only people still accusing him of it are fact-free consequence-free shills like yourself.
Meanwhile, the people who knew him, who have been saying all along that he never did that and never would do that, have been utterly vindicated.
Get on the right side of history, champ.
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:40:34
Please stop accusing people of insane crimes based on zero evidence.  Thanks.

Three spelling errors.
And one particularly interesting spot that could either require two commas or complete restructuring.

It's only the opposite if it decreases the value of existing investments.  I don't think charity does that.  Charity incrementally increases the value of investments.  If nothing else, it provides direct security and a sort of folk insurance policy, because people go out of their way for other people they perceive to be "nice" or "good."

I only consider you a professional beer drinker if you get paid for it.
Professional artist and artist are totally different things.  I'm not trying to impress you with my skills in either.
