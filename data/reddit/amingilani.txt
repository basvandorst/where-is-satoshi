Careful, or he'll ask for 10 EUR: [

I thought about x,y coordinates too, but without a scale, we can't know how much distance to place between the words. It also doesn't help that (since word cloud) a lot of the hint words cross into different sections.
I may be wrong, but that's just my experience. Regardless, if you do find an equation, please share :(

I _really_ wouldn't put much faith in a random poster on the internet. But then again, I'm a random poster on the internet.
Regardless, I'm glad I could help. If you do manage to get anywhere, pay it forward by posting it here. Please don't go Yoda like erm3s, or hodl all the clues like DivineLeek.

I thought about it too, but then, no words cover each other like the `notdef`covers the numbers. IMHO, it was likely added on later.

Dude, stop. Either be helpful or shove it. Stop acting like the cliche wise old man in every kung-fu movie. If you've solved the riddle, swipe the coins, or just be more collaborative.

Sure it is: [  
It's got the same message and title.

I've spent as much time as anyone else has, and I'm loving the whole collaboration we have going on. This thread is amazing.. all except bs.
Seriously dude, stop throwing random words and drop your holier-than-thou attitude. You're not helping with your "crawl before you walk" word soup. And your random sentences that have no premise.

Same, but I still don't understand the relationship between the three words. I think this was another dead-end.

I meant more like a specific equation from the image :) not a general question

TL:DR: I haven't solved the puzzle, but here's more word-soup. Now, give me 20% if you win with a 10 EUR advance right now. Also beware of vampires and Sundar Pichai.

Guess he couldn't take criticism. Regardless, if you're looking for his posts:

I was actually hoping you were closer to solving it than us, but IMHO you've gone down a rabbit hole. Colors aren't exact in print, unfortunately. I've done color analysis already, and discarded that as improbable :(

Also, the verification messages he made were done from a segwit address.

The name doesn't matter. The puzzle is distributed in print, as well as online, and the canonical image is at

"ends with", plenty of words end with Y: ability, alley, anxiety, etc.

Contra. Take my upvote.
