Banks definitely don’t hold every dollar in a vault. They only have a % of deposits stored. The rest they invest. This is why banks like Northern Rock went under, fear and panic led to a shit ton of customers trying to withdraw all their cash and the bank didn’t have enough physical cash at hand to give it them.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:31:15
Yes. You convert it to the GBP/EUR rate at the time of the transaction. 
Tax is based on residency not the currency or location of the money. If you’re in the UK for 183 days a year you’re a UK tax resident and tax is due on your worldwide income
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:05
I don’t understand people’s mentality, you bought in at $17.5k or whatever and now it’s low you sell for fear (that it’ll go down even more).
The only way you’re guaranteed to make a loss is if you sell at a loss. 
This is crypto, it’s highly volatile, it’s been down and bounced back before. I’m willing to bet it’ll bounce back again. It might take a long time but I don’t see the sense in losing 40% of your investment now

I’m not on Android unfortunately. Have you published the code on GitHub?

By last year you also mean last month, yes?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:39:30
Just bought more, I think it’s a great price. If it goes lower, I’ll buy some more.
I think everyone who got in at £14k are shitting their pants

Don’t try and time the market just decide how much you want to buy and buy either in one, or over time to even out the rate you get.
Then apply the lesson you’ve learned.... HODL

This is not a retirement fund. This is relatively new, it’s untested, unregulated. GTFO if you can’t handle the pressure. Coinbase is aids, we all know that
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:36:04
Wish I was in the US just to see that $20k. In the UK (Coinbase anyway) has the price at £14930 so we’re shooting for the big 15... it’s just not the same tho smh

HODLING TO THE MOOOOOON
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:50:25
It’s not a paper wallet, it’s a Software wallet. And exactly what I did: Coinbase &gt; GDAX &gt; wallet. The wallet I recommend for beginners is Electrum, it’s fairly easy to configure.
Make sure you follow the security measures in the guide (confirming signatures), do a test wipe of your wallet to confirm you can recover it (before you transfer BTC) if your hard drive ever dies and always send just a small test amount to your wallet first so you know it works.
Here’s a list of wallets 
And if you pick Electrum here’s a good guide: 
I’ve not used a paper wallet myself but that would be another option. It allows you to generate private keys etc offline (ie all the info on a sheet of paper) the benefit being your not on the internet and can’t be hacked. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:38:51
Dammit I can’t deceive whether to buy now or anticipate it going down further and buying then. Only have so much Coinbase limit 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:50:43
I like dip with my Bitcoin. Nom nom nom

I got in pretty late to the game a couple of weeks ago and got a little ₿ at £11900 since then it mooned and I never thought I’d get any at that price again.
It’s just dipped below that so I’ve bought some more. Happy days
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:29
Lucky bastard

@_date: 2017-12-14 16:31:54
It won’t matter where you sell or in what currency it will be taxable where your tax residency is. Tax residency is based on number of days per year in one country.
For example, if you live in the uk for 200 days of tax year, then move to Belize and instantly sell your ₿, you’re still a uk Tax resident &amp; the gain is reported there.
Different countries have different definitions of Tax resident so if she’s a hefty mare see a tax accountant before you offload  
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:19:39
Can’t see why not, download the Linux wallet from Etherum and send it to that address.
I’ve also got one lying around, might be a good idea to do it, nice one

RemindME! One Year “how’d this guy do?”
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:03:59
Nobody I know has any. I work in tech and only one guy out of about 50 threw $100 into ethereum.
I mentioned this to a colleague and he said he had a half a dozen friends in crypto - so I guess it’s who your circle is.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:11:52
Damnit, cos Coinbase can't handle volume I had a number of attempted buys cancelled this morning, now Im trying to buy this dip and they say I've had too many card attempts.
They're so lame

Fucking a
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:58:15
Why is it that on Coinbase the current value is £12800 but when you go to buy it says the rate is £13700?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:23:07
GDAX owns Coinbase. Open up an account with GDAX which is simple if you're verified on Coinbase. Transfer BitCoin to GDAX (free) then transfer from GDAX to wallet (also free - GDAX pay network fee). All in all... free
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:01:31
You’re doing it wrong.
But you’ve still won. Where else do you know that you can flip a 75k profit in a month or two. Congrats. Have a very merry christmas

Investing a small chunk this weekend. From what I’ve read Sunday would be a good time but it’s going up now.
What are your opinions? Buy now or will there be a lull before the futures?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:21:12
I would assume a surge as Coinbase users try it out but wtfdik
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:29:36
Thanks, thats pretty sweet considering I only sent ₿0.0002 as an initial test so I assume the network fee was more!

If this is Coinbase I think this is how they make their money? I don’t think I’ve ever clicked on it at say £14k and it’s been £14k

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:36:16
Oh dear, have a rest then.
You only make a loss if you sell. If you keep it and it continues to rise over the next few years and you sell, or you begin using it to buy real world goods, you’re good.
I’m making a bet that the value of Bitcoin will be higher in the future.
Is it a risky bet? Yes, but one I can afford to lose. But for today, I’m happy to get it at a lower price.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:16:45
Hope so so I buy that delicious ₿ 
I held out today didn’t buy more during the dip because I want use my limited Coinbase limit at the right time 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:14:40
I’m hodling you bro, to the moon

Cool story bro

Coinbase.com took me 5 mins to sign up, get verified and add my credit card
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:48:20
HEDL'D. And bought the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:48:24
And yes I know it’s a glitch ��
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:20:00
Glad you found your moon, just interested in this a year from now. All the best
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:54:38
Coinbase. Only because that’s who I’m verified with. It’s good for a beginner, very easy to use. Quite high fees tho so once you get going might be worth looking elsewhere
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:40:45
Just bought a little more bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:32:18

What we’re really looking for is D2F
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:53:23
I’d buy more if Conbase hadnt crashed 50% of the time I went to buy and taken me over my daily card charge attempts
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:30:43
Yeah it’s not dead.
What it needs to be is an actual way of paying, it’s clunky, most people don’t QR as easily as they Apple Pay. And how can anyone price their products if the price changes so quickly.
As much as I love anarchistic nature of bitcoin, the losses and pain it causes people right here right now show that regulation and stability creates the necessary environment for it to be a viable currency.
But then without the volatility we have no chance of making our money back ����
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:32:22
I’m HODLing. I don’t give a shit, I only put in a bit more than I could afford to lose and if I lose it all lesson learned. But if it comes back like it did to the original HODLer (OH), then I’m winning

Yeh bro
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:52:08
That’s really good info. Thanks
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:40:20
Think it’s gonna crash again by a lot?
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:31:50
How does this compare to previous price crashes? I’m interested in a comparison between the fall in % and the length of the drop 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:15:27
Well quite a few people were quoting buffet when we were nearing $20k - “be fearful when people are greedy, be greedy when people are fearful’.
The quote held true while it was going up, wonder if now really is a good time to be greedy now everyone’s shitting the bed.
Personally, I have no fucking idea but will be buying my monthly quota on payday whatever the price.
