The constitution was never changed. It was changed for example when the 18th amendment was added for the prohibition of alcohol.  Later when prohibition was repealed, the 18th amendment was repealed.  How come for the war on drugs there was never a constitutional amendment to make drugs illegal?  Oh because the tyrants in the government stopped following the law of the land, that is why.
If they want to disobey the current constitution then they need a constitutional amendment.  If no amendment then it means they are criminals and guilty of treason against America.  You hate to break it to me, but we live in a communist country now that doesn't obey the constitution? Nice, it seems you are happy with the American Republic being destroyed.  You may be guilty of treason as well for supporting such a thing.  The penalty for that used to be death.

Yes because your question was stupid and you are a troll, and everyone knows the answer to your question, so it was more effective to show how you will just find any excuse to bash bitcoin and bitcoiners.  It doesn't matter to you that the price is up 4000% in the last 2 years.  You want to claim the price is dropping and say you told us so, when the price has been rising exponentially. 
It shows how pathetic you are.  Mostly people who say look at the price its crashing, are just haters who are jealous of early adopter success.  Most of you are just failures in your regular life because of the Planned Communist Economy , so you need to find reasons to attack others who are successful to make yourself feel better inside.

Most people who identify as anarchists aren't for no rules at all.  They will agree that you shouldn't defraud or steal from others. Most believe that we should have extremely limited state, and that most everything can be solved by free market activities.  This is actually what the Founding Fathers of America believed as well. This is why labels are not good, and you should never label yourself as something, because it can always be attacked as a straw man.  The world is more nuanced than labels.

I totally agree that bitcoin paper cash opens up a whole new demographic.  I have thought of this for a while, and I understand why people would have concerns about such paper bitcoin money.  However, I think it would be possible to have proof of reserves for each note on the blockchain somehow.  This would allow us to get the benefits of paper money, while mitigating the risks. It would also solve the 10 minute confirmation time problem for brick and mortar transactions. 
The notes could be redeemed for real bitcoins the same as notes in the past were redeemable for gold and silver.  Regulations however would be a huge obstacle in creating paper bitcoins in the USA.  Probably MSB licenses and other impossible tasks are needed.  There would be a very high risk of going to prison, which makes it unfeasible at this time.

It would help bitcoin catch on a lot faster.  You should care about grandma using it, because that means more adoption of sound money over FIAT, which leads to freedom and prosperity, and takes away power from the tyrannical state.  It also makes your bitcoin holdings more valuable.  We are competing with dollars.  Dollars are both electronic and physical paper.

You are assuming that the price of ASIC miners will stay constant.  Likely if bitcoin price does not go up, then ASIC mining equipment will be less valuable and sell for cheaper prices.  Holders of ASICs will sell them for a cheaper price.  
Also manufacturers have no incentive to sell ASICs at a lower price right now when they could just mine for themselves.  That is why the consumer will likely never get a good deal on an ASIC unless they are buying in huge bulk directly from the manufacturer, and even then its risky.  There will always be some that want to buy an ASIC for a hobby as well, which makes it further unprofitable for everyone else.
It is hard to say what the difficulty will do.  Perhaps the increase in difficulty will slow down, but i doubt manufacturers are quitting yet.  New more advanced ASICs will keep coming out, which will negate the effect of older miners shutting off their machines that are no longer profitable.

When creating a new form of money that is going to compete with FIAT monopolies, you can't expect to get full adoption immediately.  What did they expect for everyone to just instantly switch to full bitcoin holdings overnight?  Businesses have a bottom line, and big business especially can't afford the volatility risk with bitcoin.  Three years ago, most would not have imagined that bitcoin would gain this much traction this fast.  If we continue this trajectory it will not be long before the volatility decreases making it more viable for big companies to hold bitcoin instead of FIAT.

Perhaps the bitcoin notes could function differently than current notes.  For example, a merchant at a store could possibly scan the note's QR code and have it go into some database or sidechain.

But paper bills have some advantages.  They are more anonymous and private.  They work without the internet.  They are easier for grandmas to use.  There is no worry about double spends before the 10 minute confirmation time is up. You do not need a smart phone. In the past paper bills were redeemable in gold and silver, so there is no reason not to have redeemable bitcoin notes.  Just because they have destroyed the current paper money system with fraud, does not mean we can't realize the benefits of paper money with bitcoin and improve upon it with things like proof of reserves on the blockchain.

No it is not safe.  It is about as safe as PayPal, who are notorious for locking up people's money and not giving it back.  Trusting a third party to hold your private keys is not a good idea, look at what happened with MtGox.  You are better off using electrum or bitcoin qt, or other decentralized application that allows you to hold your own private keys.
I suggest using cold storage on multiple USB devices or a paper wallet.  If you want to be able to spend the coins more easily from cold storage then Trezor is probably the best solution, but it may not make sense to spend $119 on a Trezor if you are not holding that many coins.  
This tutorial by Kristov Atlas is simple to follow and provides a very secure and cheap way to store coins on USB in cold storage for long term:

I think the ATMs are also illegal, but people just buy them because they are cool and set them up in a few obscure places.  The skyhook ATM for example is opensourced and cheap for anyone to buy (I think its $1,000).  They aren't widespread enough to get SWAT team attention yet.  I doubt bitcoin ATMs will ever be widespread in America unless you get face scanned, thumb printed, blood tested, pay huge fees, and give over your first born in order to use it.  Jeff Berwick was teaming up with some people to launch the first bitcoin ATMs in America about a year ago, but they had to cancel the plans because of legal risks and regulations.

By using dollars you are legitimizing FIAT, and devaluing bitcoin.  By using bitcoin you promote bitcoin adoption and strengthen the price in the long term.
Also you claim you own dollars, so why own dollars when owning dollars instead of bitcoin hurts the price of btc? Your logic does not hold.  Also you actually don't own dollars if they are in your bank account.  In fact the bank doesn't even own them either, the bank lent them out using fractional reserve techniques.  Also trezor is not using bitpay or any processing company that liquidates the bitcoins immediately, they are accepting bitcoin directly, and who knows what they will choose to do with it after that.

I believe obeying the constitution would be a good solution to a lot of our problems.  For example doing so would end the unconstitutional war on drugs, the unconstitutional Department of Education, the unconstitutional Federal Reserve central bank, the unconstitutional banker bailouts, and the unconstitutional spying on Americans, just to name a few.  
Simply following the constitution like those such as Ron Paul advocate would be a huge step in the right direction.  I believe common sense is our solution.

They don't ratify anything anymore, they simply disobey the law of the land, and from wikipedia, here is the punishment for that: 
Therefore the United States Code at 18 U.S.C. § 2381 states "whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States."

It is probably a lot better idea to do this than transferring directly in and out of coinbase.  Its all about plausible deniability, and if questioned, always deny it.

Very interesting points, thanks for your post.  I agree with much of what you said.  That is why it is often bad to label ourselves as anarchocapitalist or any label, because reality is much more complex than simple labels.  One point I would like to make is that we have not truly seen free markets in our country in a really long time.  So we never know what kind of free market solutions could arise from capitalism.  
We have seen giant leaps in technology over the years, most of this technology was lead by the USA because in the past we had a lot of freedom, which allowed innovation.  Now we are kind of running on fumes, and the anti-capitalist controls are squashing innovation.  Imagine if we had true freedom, the types of technology that we might develop.  Maybe if we had true capitalism we would be able to create technologies that help the environment.  Also there could be private EPA type entities that regulate businesses or put their stamp of approval on businesses.  If those private EPA type organizations become corrupted the consumers will react by choosing a different private EPA type organization to trust.  It stops regulatory capture.  In this way the free market competition weeds out the corruption.  Then consumers who care about the environment will buy from companies with their seal of approval.  Many people do care deep down about environmental issues, meaning there is a market force driving innovations that benefit the environment.

Don't post that trash here.  We know what the words mean, don't try to twist truth or history.  The whole blog posting you linked says absolutely nothing.  It goes over some historical context of Franklin's quote having to do with the Pennsylvania Assembly and the French and Indian War.  This fact has no significance to the validity of the words written by Franklin.  The words speak for themself, and it makes absolutely no sense as to why the historical context of the words would change their meaning in this case.  
The author is trying to influence the reader to believe that the quote means something else than what it actually means. It is horrnedous that someone would resort to such tactics. Basically it is some propaganda designed for people of very low intelligence or people who do not have time to read things and think for themselves.
Not surprising the author is pushing this propaganda considering how the author describes himself:
"Welcome to my personal web site. I am a senior fellow in Governance Studies at The Brookings Institution. I am co-founder and editor in chief of Lawfare, which is devoted to non-ideological discussion of “Hard National Security Choices,” and I am a member of the Hoover Institution’s Task Force on National Security and Law."

Marc Andreessen attacks libertarians in this video at 17:30.  He says that libertarians are going to turn against bitcoin in a couple years.  He thinks libertarians do not know that the blockchain is public, and when we find out it is public, it will cause us to turn against bitcoin.  
So I guess he must think libertarians are stupid, and he says his government friends love bitcoin because they can use the public ledger to fight crime and terrorism.  Maybe he underestimates the technological potential of the market to come up with solutions that maintain privacy for individuals, while providing transparency for monopolisitic government agencies.
Maybe though, his government friends are the stupid ones for not understanding that their entire house of cards is built on FIAT scams and debt, and if bitcoin succeeds they will likely lose their jobs or even end up in prison for violating the constitution with things like illegal NSA spying.  What happens when all the libertarians have acquired the wealth and power from their early bitcoin holdings, and the government statists are broke with worthless FIAT??

You are the one spinning it.  In 2 years the price is up 4000%, and its up much more than that if you go back further.  So you will see an asset that has gone up 4000% in 2 years and then try to tell everyone the price is in a landslide?  Yes the price has gone down recently after the peak as happens with most meteoric rises of assets.  It has happened in bitcoin's past when the price spiked to 30 dollars then crashed down to 2 dollars.  You same trolls screamed the same thing then, you told us so remember?
America is absolutely a communist country with a Planned Economy.  There is the Federal Reserve Central Bank which was created in 1913, public education, social security, and a graduated income tax which are all part of the communist manifesto: 
We have facism which is the unification of the corporations and the state through regulatory capture.  Only GE can create power plants for example.  Obama will bankrupt you otherwise: 
The health care system is being taken over, the department of education is unconstitutional.  The Republicans used to take a stand against the department of education but not anymore.
The NSA is spying on you illegally violating your 4th amendment.  The TSA is searching you when you travel violating your 4th amendment.  Police are becoming militarized with black masks and tanks on the streets.  They are painting all the tanks black for domestic disturbance.  
You need licenses to do anything, you need permission from the state to have a business.  Everything is illegal, and the average person is comitting 3 felonies per day including you: 
So it makes sense that those in the dark would be the ones to attack innocent people and those who are in the light and aware of reality.

For example the 4th amendment still stands, yet everyone knows the NSA is spying on Americans, and the Patriot Act is unconstitutional.  You are an extremist anti-American communist sympathizer, so of course a real American constitutionalist would seem extreme to a nutjob like you.

No saying something is a fetish of free market, makes you sound like a real jerk.  Seems like your have a foot fetish, in the form of licking government boots.  But I should have expected this from someone named "theonetruesexmachine".  Anyone who understands capitalism knows that regulatory capture is what causes monopolies, and if you want to deny it and make insults calling it a fetish, then you are a very sick individual.
What you said makes absolutely no sense.  You said that you "believe free market leads to monopolies and other anticapitalist entities"  This is a complete paradox what you said, and your statement contradicts itself, and makes you seem not very intelligent.  Free market leads to anticapitalism eh??  You are very confused because we have not had free markets in a long long time, which is why the monopolies exist.  You are looking at all of our problems and blaming capitalism, when we do not have capitalism right now, we have communism.
In the communist manifesto, some of the main tenets are a central bank, a graduated income tax, public education, and public healthcare.  By any logical metric, America is now a communist country.  So pointing to America's problems of monopolies and blaming the free market, seems like a government licking boot fetish to me.

You have some pretty logical points.  It is true no system is perfect in an imperfect world.  I care about the environment also.  Possibly there could be some free market solutions to environmental issues. But it seems environmental regulation just gets completely subject to capture.  
Regulatory capture of the EPA could result in large corporations getting away with pollution on an even greater scale than in a free market system.  For example the delapidated nuclear power plants are a huge problem in the USA and around the world as we found with Fukushima.  Yet in many instances these companies like General Electric are protected by governments.  The risk once again is put upon the public, while the profits are privatized, similar to the banker bailout issue.  Also when people get hurt by a melt down like Fukushima the corporations don't seem to be paying anybody for damages.  
There is a huge energy problem in the United States due to regulations on carbon emissions as well.  Since the regulators are captured, GE is allowed to have a monopoly on energy production and other companies are restricted by the laws.  This is seen for example, with Obama's words on wanting to bankrupt the coal industry, while the head of GE is on his economic board:

One good way to secure your bitcoins is to buy a hardware wallet like Trezor.  You can keep your private keys offline at all times, but still use the device to sign transactions and spend your coins safely.  You will backup the wallet on paper by writing down a list of words that will act as your recovery passphrase, so if the device ever fails, you can recover your wallet.  So just buy the coins from coinbase, then send to your Trezor address.

You are the combative one that trolls anyone who is for freedom and calls them names.  You use dirty tactics. It is possible you are a paid shill. Or perhaps you work in a government job, so you feel a subconcious need to defend government at all costs. In order to blend in you have to cheer on btc, while sprinkling in your anti-America, pro-government propaganda.  I am simply defending freedom and truth.  The Founding Fathers said to be vigilant and to guard freedom like a precious jewel.  People called the Founding Fathers extreme also.  The government even calls Thomas Jefferson and George Washington the first terrorists: 
Yes I know it looks very bleak, and nobody is following the constitution in America now because we have slipped so deep into tyranny.  There are so many people working in the parasitic system that they are forced to defend the status-quo, so they can suck off the rest of us to survive.  But what happens when the host is dead?  What happens when the producers of America can no longer produce anymore because of the restraints on capitalism are so severe?  Then the collapse of the USSR happens, if you ever looked at history.
Yes there are some really sick and brainwashed people like yourself in America that were educated in the public education system, and raised on television propaganda. I understand America is very sick now with tyranny, and people like you are a cancer eating us alive.  But once America is completely sucked dry by you parasites, then what will you suck off of?  Everything occurs in cycles, and right now we are in a time of tyranny, but the pendulum will naturally swing back towards liberty, as we see with bitcoin.  Because then there was bitcoin, which can take away the lifeblood of tyranny.  By educating people about tyranny, it helps bitcoin have a better chance to succeed and withstand attacks to be snuffed out by the state.  By educating people about what is happening to our country, we will better be able to put the pieces back together once everything completely collapses similar to the USSR and other countries.  During that time there will be a lot of trials by jury, and possibly a lot of people accused of treason.  You may be on the list.

Yeah exactly.  As usual people often agree on some things, but misunderstand each other due to semantics.  Here the problem lies with the word "regulation".  Regulation is a lot different than common sense laws like do not kill, do not steal.  Regulation as I usually take the word to mean, means regulating an industry.  The word regulation often means putting governmental limitations on free market activity, that is what I am against. 
However regulation can also mean free market regulations.  Like for example instead of relying on government insurance like the FDIC, we can have private insurance.  Instead of relying on the FDA, we can have free market organizations to put their seal of approval on things, and let consumers decide who to trust.  This free market competition is what is needed for healthy regulation.  When there are monopolies or oligopolies through governmental regulatory capture, that is when people suffer.  Being not subject to regulatory capture, free market organizations are more accountable, and have more incentive to do a good job.  They are less prone to corruption.  Free market competition destroys harmful monopolies.  The word regulation can have a lot of meanings, so don't get caught up on semantics.  You should really check out Patrick Byrne's CEO of Overstock's speech about regulatory capture that I linked above: 
You might learn some things about free market capitalism and history. You really need to learn the word "regulatory capture".  The monopolies that you claim are caused by the free market are not caused by capitalism at all.  These monopolies are caused by regulatory capture, if you watch the video you will understand.

But at the end of the day, what matters most are the loud voices of the greater community.  The bitcoin community and have showed how smart and powerful we the people can be.  As long as most of us remain vocal and opposed to these tyrannical laws, there is a lot of hope for the future. 
We are having a huge effect.  We got an extension on the bit-license and we need to keep the pressure up.  Then when we the people are effective at staving off regulation, all the boot-lickers will say they told us so, that regulation was never that bad.  When it was only because of our loud efforts that we stopped it.

We want all of the draconian stuff deleted from the proposal. No more licenses to create alt-coins, no more prohibiting investment of profits in bitcoin. No more of the invasive KYC/AML stuff that you require for us, while your high level meetings are held in secret. You claim the moral high ground of stopping money laundering when everyone knows you let the banks launder trillions in drug money: 
The banks are allowed to launder 378 billion in this one incident, and nobody went to jail, and they only paid a small fine, less than the profits received for the laundering. Bitcoin's entire market cap is only 6.7 billion, yet you are more focused on squashing bitcoiners than the true criminals who ruin our country, and then get too big to fail banker bailouts. You are supposed to be a servant to the people, so start acting like it. We are your boss Lawsky.

Seems like you are all afraid of alt-coins.  Why do you hate competition?  The OP says that alt-coins dilute the total supply of units, which is preposterous.  Did silver units threaten gold units by increasing the supply? Not much.  Maybe silver was a better unit in many cases for smaller transactions, it was called "poor man's gold". There are lot of shit rocks out there, like quartz, and copper, and a million other types.  Did those all dilute the supply of money units represented by gold or silver? Not really.
You seem scared that another coin will replace or take value away from yours, and you want to boycott businesses and intimidate them into not accepting other alt-coins.  It not only puts bitcoiners in a bad light, it makes them look like protectionists.  If anything boycott companies that accept only FIAT scam Federal Reserve Note dollars.  Don't boycott companies for further embracing crypto currency and sound money that does not have any authority over it.

Actually bitpay allows merchants to keep whatever % they want in bitcoin.  The OP mentioned that there was a loan of 1 btc to start the business, which needs to be paid back. So you do not even have any proof the coins are liquidated, and if they are so what? Maybe he has operating expenses needed to be paid with FIAT.  By accepting bitcoin, he is increasing the value of the Bitcoin network by allowing 1 more place where btc can be spent.  Also people will see the bitcoin mugs when used, and inquire about bitcoin, meaning this is also a good marketing technique to spread bitcoin adoption.

This is a fallacious, unlogical, nonsensical argument.  People are really nit picking to try to discredit the founding fathers and justify NSA spying.
The quote in question is this: "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety"
Franklin was obviously trying to make an analogy of sorts to help get the point across for the issue at hand (the government ceding their right to tax the Penn family.)  But Franklin was saying it as in a general truth and using that truth to justify his decision for the issue at hand.  
Not to mention other founding fathers had very similar statements.  Patick Henry comes to mind.

The government's grip on FIAT money is destroying America and impovershing the people.  The regulations are blocking the economy from flourishing, and bitcoin is a way around that.  The people will only put up with criminals running things for so long, especially when the crimials are killing the geese that lay their golden eggs.

I think it has grown to such a significant size, that the government would look so evil if they tried to ban it that the people would not allow it.  Remember the amount of tyranny you live under is the exact amount the people put up with.  We the people have more power than we give ourself credit for.  Already there are huge VC investors, and bitcoin's market cap is in the billions now.  We have crossed a threshold that makes it more difficult for them to ban it.  If the price was still 10 dollars they would have a lot more success banning it.
Also now that bitcoin is an accepted and useful thing, it is never going away.  If they do ban it, the price would take a hit on the news, but in the long term I see it as bullish for the price if they ban it.  Just like when they ban marijuana it causes the price to increase.  Banning it makes it harder for people to get it, but they still want it, so they will pay more for it.  I know if they ban it, I am still holding.

All things I mentioned including a central bank, graduated income tax, public education are all main tenets of the communist manifesto: 
America did not start off communist, that was not our Founder's vision in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.  The Fed for instance didn't exist until 1913.  The department of Education didn't exist until 1979 and the Republicans fought it on the basis that it is unconstitutional. The Patriot Act was not signed until after 9/11.  Too-big-to-fail banker bailouts never occurred in our nation's history until 2008.  Unconstitutional Obamacare didn't exist until recently. The unconstitutional EPA didn't exist until 1970.  First they said the NSA didn't exist, then they said the NSA existed but were not spying on Americans, then Snowden showed us all that the NSA is violating the constitution and illegally spying on all Americans. Sorry you choose to deny reality, and give into government brainwashing.

When does regulation work?? If it worked I would be all for it.  Maybe it works sometimes on a very small scall for a very short period of time, but in the long run, it does not work.  It does not work because regulation is subject to regulatory capture.  If you have not yet, I highly recommend watching Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne's keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2014 conference: 
In it, he discusses the topic of regulatory capture among other important things.  The subject of regulatory caputre is so important to him that he even created a website  to expose the corruption occuring because of the regulations you are advocating.  Regulation is not working.  We have common sense laws like don't steal, don't rape, don't kill, etc.. that is all you need in a free society.
Bottom line regulation is communism, not capitalism.  Free markets can do a much better job at regulating things than governments.  Free markets have incentive to fix things and make things better, but governments actually have incentive to make things worse.  Then they can say look how bad it is, give us more money.  People are getting some pretty nice salaries to wreck America because of people who do not understand regulatory capture or capitalism.
