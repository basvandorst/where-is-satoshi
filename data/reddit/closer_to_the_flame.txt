Just think about those poor suckers who bought BTC at it's ATH at the time of $1k!
Bet they are all really regretting not panic selling when it dropped.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:48:05
Yeah it's a small investment to protect your coins. As long as it's a trusted seller, that makes a lot of sense.

If I upgrade to a 3.0.x wallet, can I still receive non-segwit transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:08:38
Oh. I considered that, but Amazon was a lot more expensive and I read about some scams that were going on with sellers trying to dupe people by putting in fake seed lists or something, so I figured I would buy it from ledger themselves. I just checked their site and it says the new batch will ship 3/26.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:39:22


You mean like with actual physical cash? I don't know of any electronic method that takes 1s. Most would take days or even weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:44:18
True, but I'm under the impression that if segwit got wider adoption the fees would go down even more?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:02:44
Are they shipping now? I was about to buy one a couple of weeks ago and ledger's website said they were back ordered for months. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:49:24
I don't think we have that in the US. It takes me a week or so to send money from my bank to another electronically. If I need it done fast I have to withdraw cash and drive over to the other bank to deposit it.

OK, it would be near impossible to hack a specific wallet. But my Electrum wallet seed is only 12 words. And it seems like a lot of wallets were or are using just 12. With the number of wallets out there, if a hacker just tries random combinations of 12 words, how long would it take them to stumble onto a random wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:34:57
I bought at the last dip, now I'm out of fiat!
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:23:00
It would certainly help if everyone got upgraded to segwit, especially exchanges.

Scumbag commies! They don't even shut poor people out of the healthcare system to give rich people tax cuts.

I used to love bitcoin as a way to send money across the world essentially for free. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:20:23
I bought my first btc at $95. I bought my last btc at $19,942. And a whole bunch in between those. I'm still kind of freaked out. 
Just because bitcoin has done well in it's first few years doesn't mean it's always going to recover. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
This isn't about BCash, it's about the futures market. BCash fucked us up but it too has been dropping like a stone. The money isn't going into other coins, either. I think it's going to Wall Street because they found a way to profit off of bitcoin. 
In the long term, BTC could go anywhere. If a better coin comes along, bitcoin could be worth nothing. If an exploit is found, or if enough exchanges fuck people over, or some other catastrophe happens bitcoin could become worthless. 
I just don't understand the blind faith. It's a great technology, but there are already cryptocurrencies out there that are better in ways. Bitcoin just has it's name and history going for it. And the nature of bitcoin means that the majority has to play nice for it to succeed - and we keep seeing the community split and many are attacking/sabotaging btc. 
I think we'll probably be OK, at least in the short term. But the crazy bull run is clearly over, and the price could be down for a long time. I just recall the first time the price went through the roof a few years ago, then it lost nearly all its gains for a couple of years.

How do you know how much your dollar is worth without the internet? 
If BTC was widely adopted, prices would be obvious. New ways to access your coins would be developed, etc.

My mother is convinced Alaska is an island. Doesn't think you can get there by car. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:49:50
Eggs in one basket kind of thing. 
If I got super rich off of bitcoin's value going up, I would want to diversify a bit to just make sure I would remain rich if a catastrophe happened with btc. Buy some fiat, alt coins, gold, mutual funds, etc.
But all that would be a back up kind of thing. A safety net. Like you, I would keep the bulk in bitcoin. Especially since it's deflationary.

In the long run, $16.4 *is* cheap. 
This insane parabolic growth won't last, but I think the ceiling for BTC is way higher than $17k.

Not the ass I was hoping for.

I tried that, it just gives me another copy of wallet.dat. 
How do I pull the keys out of it? 
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:26:09
Ok thank you! I'm going to try this soon but I have to leave and won't be back until tomorrow. 
Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:02:05
I've been buying since $90, and I'm still buying (DCA). I even bought a little at 19k. 
Sold some when I was desperate for cash, wasn't the best timing but still came out ahead. Wish I had sold it all around $20k but I'm still a believer. This is what bitcoin does. It goes way up, it comes back down then later it goes way way way up. Well, that's what it *did* \- I'm hoping that's what it's going to do again. But who knows.

Ah yes. Bank of America and Wells Fargo are the government's fault. Gotcha. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 07:40:54
So bitcoin price has gone up a bit over 526000000% in 10 years? I think I did that math right. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:07:41
Damn. Now I'm only up 1000% since earlier this year. What ever shall I do?!!

I'm subscribed to that sub and don't hate everyone but the homeless. Yeah, there is a lot of sarcasm and hatred there, but it's because a massive portion of the world is suffering horribly due to capitalism in many ways (I'm not a socialist, I just recognize the weaknesses and strengths in all systems). But they do make a lot of very good points.
I mean, the worst example of 'late stage capitalism' is huge banking monopolies controlling the money supply for the benefit of just a few people - isn't that why so many people believe in cryptocurrencies?
I find it ironic that you are painting with such a broad brush, complaining that they paint with too broad of a brush. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:08:02
Yeah, I actually like to help people if I can, and would love to be able to influence politics and community functioning for the better if I could. The fencing myself off thing was really a joke, though I would want good security if I lived in a developing nation and had lots of money. Reforming society could be part of that security, but a fence probably wouldn't be a bad idea. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:30:31
Seriously, though. If you're extremely rich, why live in some place like NYC when you could go to a developing country and legit live like a king? I'd have a palace and 5000 acres of land around it and a big ole fence so no one could come fuck with me. Everyone I like is invited to come party with me, but on my terms. 
And if you're 15k BTC rich, you'd also own the local police, so you really would be like royalty. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:33:51
I'm poor and I'm not getting richer?

Cancer also exists everywhere naturally. Doesn't mean that we should celebrate it, or stop trying to cure it.
