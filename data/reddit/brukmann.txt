Obvious nouveau riche still using the local vinyl shop to design and apply it. Gotta go full bougie and repaint a brand new lambo (excellent stock paint obviously, hard to beat) with the B grey-ghosted underneath and 3-d metallic flake that makes a highlight flow across it with relative motion.

Well i vote they definitely don't care about their reputation. They sorted their wire transfers out a week ago and they still have a backlog of manual processing. I'll spare reddit my extemp on this

I just read what you posted on bitcointalk the other day and wanted to say thanks for your contributions. I had a rough couple of days, but my problems seem insignificant at the moment and i will be redoubling my efforts today in your honor. Oddly enough, that will include trying to wrap my head around the bitcoin source as planned. :)

I wish there were some way to get them to drop this manual process nonsense. No backlog cannot be overcome, even on a tight budget (relative to the value of their business evaporating every day). Poor management no matter how you look at it.

Hahah i literally seconds ago submitted a new request to inquire why nothing had happened for 24 hours after i "confirmed" i would accept an additional 5% fee for priority processing (they apparently need it in writing *twice*), which itself came from a request 48 hours earlier when *I* suggested the solution to my problem after 10 weeks of not offering the service to me even though I repeatedly messaged them desperate for such a solution.
Searching my call center knowledge i think at this point they have broken every rule of customer service, except perhaps point-blank telling the customer to fuck themselves.

So after I eat another 5 years of articles referring to bitcoin as "supposedly untraceable/anonymous," will I then also have to swallow dozens of brilliant fucking reporter's exposés on "bitcoin is not as anonymous as *claimed*!!1"

You spelled 'all' wrong.

I am going on 11 weeks of delay, when immediately prior I was processed in about a week.
