Banks helping the “drug war”? They should fine them like they did to HSBC when they got caught laundering money for the drug cartels. That’ll show em. But us bitcoiners are just criminals trying to buy drugs anonymously so what do we know

Hard wallets are not difficult to understand, use, or set up. If your not willing to take a couple hours out of your day to educate yourself and make sure your funds are safe, then you’ve got no room to cry and bitch when you get MtGox’d.

If you’re worried about price drop or loss of profits couldn’t you convert to a stablecoin or am I wrong?

If your funds are more then the cost of a hardware wallet you need a hardware wallet. Ledger or Trevzor is the way to go

For me it was super easy, took only a few minutes to set up a debit card and got verified overnight. Transactions were instant and moving to another wallet was just as simple

I don’t have enough altcoins to really do anything with them. When I first got into crypto I bought them to spread out my holdings but that was before I learned that altcoins basically follow bitcoin as far as the ups and downs go so I just want to convert everything to bitcoin just don’t want to get taxed sense I’m not selling for fiat

If you’re just getting started Coinbase will be fine for you. Don’t use anyone that doesn’t let you move your coins. Invest in a hard wallet and keep everything on it except for what you want to spend. Always remember not your keys not your bitcoin

If you were in a position to where you had nothing to lose (no family or marital obligations) and got a big loan like that to buy bitcoin, put it all on a hard wallet and say you “lost” or got scammed out of what you purchased, filed for bankruptcy to get out of paying the loan back and just kept the hard wallet in a safe place for later use how could you get caught or get in trouble for it?

Same thing happened to me not to long ago with Coinbase. Tried to send all of my btc to a hard wallet and they kept .2 btc in my account that they wouldn’t let me send for another 4 days

Look around at places like garage sales, flea markets and look for cheap things you can flip for more cash on eBay, offer up. You’d be surprised how fast you can build a pretty healthy stack
