Which sucks, because of course I want to sell mine for Bitcoin.

I'm also using an external HD for storing the chain and I suspected, more so following your comment, that's the reason for the long sync time. I wonder if the HD-boundness of syncing the chain is a known issue for core.

Sounds like non-miners won't be able to use this solution at all? (Unless miners decide to hand out a few satoshis out of their good will to each existing address)
Edit: I now understand skyfox_uk's comment above. It would be interesting to see if miners do offer such coins for sell, so that non-miners can also perform non-replayable transactions.
Wow, what a mess.

In other words, by not enabling replay protection:
-many non-technical bitcoin users would unknowingly and smoothly transition over to the 2X chain, in case it has the majority hashing rate. Good for you.
-many of the same users, who have no clue about splitting wallets and whatnot, are going to lose a lot of money due to replay attacks. Insanely terrible for the users.
Yet you claim to be on the users' side.

I'm actually interested in the technical details, this just announces btc.com's wallet is secure.

Can you please provide more details on how this would work?
I'm talking about my existing coins - those would be the same on both chains at the fork time. To change them to new coins on one chain, a transaction would be needed - which may be replayed on the other chain.

Baseless and ridiculous. Your claim is that protecting buyers and merchants from losing funds would increase chaos.

I like some of the analysis in the article but I think there might be a couple of inaccuracies.
The first one is about securing the network being just the miners’ role. While it’s true in the sense that mining decentralization is essential to the network’s  security (e.g. to prevent 51% attacks), full nodes also play a role a significant role. Any invalid blocks would be detected and rejected by any full node in the network, which includes, but isn’t limited, to miners.
The second one is about the network not being adaptive to supply and demand, since supply is only decreased by halvening which doesn’t occur often. The network is, in fact, adaptive to decreased mining power, by means of difficulty adjustments that occurs often and re-balance mining profits with bitcoin price.
