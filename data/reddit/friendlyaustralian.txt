Clearly it’s trivial for a private key or hard-ware wallet to be seized if they know where to look, it’s not like it’s possible for them to just pluck the coins out of the Blockchain like “they belong to us now”.

If that much money was on the line, it wouldn’t be that hard to make the decision to pocket it.

I can’t understand why my posts here get such a low amount of upvotes, this post has been viewed 500 times In less than an hour and has only one upvote on it.. makes no sense.

Smart move. 
Eth is dominate in all ways apart from marketcap, it can only be so long until that changes.

Surely you’ve hedged your bets?

You have to admit 55 tps would solve a lot of the problems the tens of thousands of people are having with BTC at this very moment.

Check your address on blockchain.info and that will tell you your true balance.

I hate to break it to you but if you didn’t own BTC before the BCH fork you’re not getting any.

Does this not bother anyone that they can create 20 mil USD out of thin air whenever they feel like it?

Nice read!
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:08:45
Just curious, why would it require a smart contract over working natively such as the other forks of bitcoin?
Any further reading on this you might have would be appreciated.

That list can't be complete or you would have included Bitcoin Cash.
How about Ethereum? Genuinely curious.

It doesn't stop there, any project forked off bitcoin without a PoW change can utilise the same ASIC miners.
