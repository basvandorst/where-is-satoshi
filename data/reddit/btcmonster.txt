@_date: 2018-01-23 07:50:05
No, no listen to any man
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:15:06
there's no issue with it, go ahead.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:15:20
the price should be affected by the fee i think.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:09:25
it's terrific.

hope you're settle down for good.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:39:44
Exactly what Im thinking. No long term investment without real efforts.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:54:47
Sorry to hear that, hope it'll be fixed soon buddy.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:18:31

@_date: 2018-01-11 16:31:38

@_date: 2018-01-23 06:54:55

@_date: 2018-01-22 08:36:46
Too bad. Hope they can set up an agreement
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:53:25
I wonder how much they really own now for giving that $75M without hesitation.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:38:00
Finally it's confirmed, it's been taking so long for the final agreement.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:10:46
People forget that one has own opinions to everything. It's normal, not one thing to bitch about.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:18:58
it's true.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:39:32
No, they haven't
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:49:01
Anything going on so far?
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:58:30
Blah, keep talking.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:15:11

@_date: 2018-01-09 09:40:41
congrats, now you've lost $10 fee for just $14.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:58:54
im here to read others' portfolio, quite interesting tho
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:27:21
That's amazing!

@_date: 2018-01-05 07:06:51

@_date: 2018-01-11 16:21:09
how traumatizing.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:33:32
they're so annoying lol, but why should we care, we know what we are doing tho
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:54:24
it has a lot to say to haters though.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:23:19
drop when we buy it and raise when we sell it hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:18:59

@_date: 2018-01-31 06:43:15

No worries dude :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:17:02
everyone knows the only people smart enough to give a correct answer are bitcoiners -------- seriously............
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:40:39
That's very nice of you, hopefully more and more people will follow your steps with the profits they've made with bitcoin due to the raising price, I hope so, not forcing them to do the same but I think it'd be so nice if we all unite together for a better life.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:16:44
thank for sharing
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:37:31
stable price is what i like. no more up and down.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:39:25
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:19:25

@_date: 2018-01-05 07:50:26

@_date: 2018-01-22 08:23:04
So people are still wondering if this is good or bad?? It's good what are you complaining for? Nothing can please you guys.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:39:30
18 hours? omg..
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:40:55
of course, must hodl!!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:10:41
Ain't funny though.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:09:42
hahahahahaha, how did you react? Just sit there and take their sympathy?
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:08:56
so this is the drama people're fussing about
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:24:51
This is how media mostly work
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:07:57
good luck to you!
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:33:13
as i see korea is the second big market of crypto in asia though. it's no surprise.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:47:38
all i care is tax free....
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:48:32
has it done for now?
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:37:16
OMG it's so scaryyy

@_date: 2018-01-19 09:25:08
coinmama I think
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:32:08
sorry not sorry is how they look
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:10:00
It does!
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:54:55
Bitpay is a pain in the ass.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:11:07
it's ok. don't worry.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:06:18
The technology is just doing its job, being better.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:49:12
No thanks, I wouldn't listen to something this random in all purposes.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:45:52
er, i know that fact. anws thank for the notice.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:42:11
done reporting.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:59:36
hahaha he's so innocent.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:39:49
All respect!
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:43:20
true, the limited amount of bitcoin is the key factor. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:33:20
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:19:04
we're not sure. but why do everyone keep saying this?
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:52:26
But 17% is not impressive.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:00:06
At least their indecision did something nice.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:01:03
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:10:19
I would def do that hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:56:34
Priceless lol
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:06:28
i bet china has tons of miners out there, they limited to give chance to others, too
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:27:52
See where the fees go aches me lol
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:07:14
no harsh feeling to give them a full lecture at all,
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:54:51
10% is def high.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:06:47
hopefully what you have said is right. but i partly don't agree with it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:22:43
Yes you can
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:47:14
Amazing, it's just the beginning of everything.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:53:54
Clickbait alert!
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:55:24
No bias or anything, I just do like Burger King &amp; BCH tbh.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:17:27
you're too quick to assume so.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:44:48
Of course LOL
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:51:32
completely agree, im quite sick of those who can't stop complaining and criticizing others are making investment by their own money, of course they want their money used for good purposes lol.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:44:38
congrats! keep going dude!
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:53:04
Cool &amp; funny at the same time
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:31:41
So I should say this is such a gold opp to grab it!
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:35:55
Needless to increase.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:45:35
that's a way to go.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:13:07
it's hard to convince people to focus on bitcoin mainly cuz of adoption, not price. wise investment is what they want.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:44:56
Tether is not a bad choice actually.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:26:04
it takes forever to go though i bet.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:15:55
No, it's not.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:48:24
"May" is a very tiny chance. So, invalid!
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:03:51
Nike there you do, sue him.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:11:13
Bet it was bought by BTC lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:09:22
where is the exact location?
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:42:48
use gdax
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:45:21
True, be satisfied with what you have is a key to happy life. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:58:39
am i the only one who doesn't follow the hype?
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:15:52
it's great that they listen and support your idea! keep it up! good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:57:10
That's too long. You're so patient hah!
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:11:32
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:00:36
At first, it's just a speculation, we need more proofs in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:00:56
but it's the fee then we have to follow, unless they do something about it
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:04:48
great detailed graphic, anw thank for sharing this.
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:46:45
that's gon mess up the real price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:14:57
Well, at least for now. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:18:11
This might be true from the other world hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:15:54
hahaha, what a surprise lol how would u evaluate their prediction? a total joke?
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:37:52
The only or two reasons are enough. I think.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:53:32
YAY, the biggest market in Asia!
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:16:01
no, you're not a noob :D
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:24:36
i wanna know it, too. been searching anywhere but no sign of it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:00:53
idon't think they care T_T
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:45:34
No worries at all, as I believe so
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:22:52
Of course, that can't happen!
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:05:06
It's port, as I'd guessed heheh
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:50:28
That Paywall
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:12:05
some said bitcoin is not about getting rich, i wonder what are they searching for lol
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:56:32
aw, congrats
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:42:39
Yes, buy while u can, yet hold valuable coins.

wow, the jerky look delishh
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:20:57
hahaha have u explained her thoroughly?
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:40:26
they get no benefits/profits from it so better skip it.
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:50:56
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:42:26
Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:41:21
that's too far awayyyy
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:44:40
Definitely. Moving all out is a must.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:21:54
is it Tenx?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:57:08
why would they purchase followers? as if they haven't got enough attention they want? lol
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:14:26
at least the fee drop is a new year's gift
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:17:37
Great, now that they remember to give the guide. thanks
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:09:08
is the bubble exploding? xD
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:36:30
i didn't see it...
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:43:01
Authy I suggest.
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:45:19
oh i've been looking for him forever!
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:26:35
im also an outsider, just being here reading and evaluating people's raging opinions against each others lol
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:36:49
Just the beard hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:13:49
it's awesome.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:08:45

@_date: 2018-01-29 10:56:24
Coinbase is going to the end.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:20:49
Yes, it's straight up scam out there. $2k fo itune gift card is crazyyy
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:25:20
I want all the guides in the world tooo
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:31:56
true, i don't want money kept in banks is used for shady projects and get huge profits from it without my knowing, too.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:12:54
dude, google is free.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:07:39
it's still in improvement so, i don't hope much, but keep praying it'll work out best
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:55:06
Good to go man, good luck with your business.
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:43:12
It really shows how 'investors' are just jumping onto anything that they perceive as cheap and a quick ride up ---&gt; but...but aren't all we?
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:57:36
It looks great, you def improve further in the future. Keep going kid.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:40:26
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:10:18
imagine there is that big ass coin in real life.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:14:24
well, i think to focus on one, or two or three is more important than diversifying but get no real &amp; big values/profits.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:35:44
Chill, there's only one Electrum server in Chile. What do you expect?
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:49:38
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:52:36
All i can think about is hoping there will quick solutions for this. Or else, I have no approve for crypto overall.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:43:12
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:06:31
we all feel it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:09:38
oh shiny, are they real though?
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:29:26
i bet everyone would die to have a secure phone for their wallets!
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:41:12
Is this legit news?
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:48:50
are you excited? cuz im!
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:58:09
heard it's sold out?
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:15:33
True, make Bitcoin great again. Or just fairly great.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:34:08
where is the survey?
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:59:43
The debate about the fees will never end, however I like it, at least we still care.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:53:55
50cent is no more 50 cents.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:36:50
i usually check btcmanager.com
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:38:29
see the bubble? once you blow it too much, it'll explode for sure, same with how bitcoin has been growing, as everyone keep assuming it's gon explode one day. but i have no idea about it, cuz we can't tell the future. for now, just enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:51:29
did u heard that ISIS buy their weapons by Bitcoin too?
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:09:04
Hope he could find it
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:01:24
what a joke for those who claim they invest for the technology haha
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:07:32
We need more memes like this for further celebrations.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:18:25
make a wide spreading opinions about your topic. not focusing on just one thing.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:44:32
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:48:06
I knew it, LN could work out so well, more than I expected.
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:57:53
post a picture please!
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:07:43
That's no surprise.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:13:57
Hahaha, "too tiny"
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:17:49
Updating us later :( Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:55:31
Gone for good.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:34:06
I don't pay too much attention for that rating, that means nothing, when it's solely based on some individuality, how can we trust that?
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:10:05
Sassy hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:21:53
so many rants about coinbase, they should fix it asap!
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:33:09
i don't even want a ps4 lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:35:44
this June as my prediction (personally)
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:12:46
All the way to shapeshift
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:19:31
It's interesting to think about it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:01:18
hahaha what a cry baby
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:21:25
Dude, this guy is from the future.!
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:18:47
Im quite confused over this, but it's ok I will go figure.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:28:51
so they ban or not, have seen so many posts stirring about this.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:35:36
Wait for under 9k ones hehe
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:50:10
When will this exactly happen?
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:16:03
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:19:33
check out btcmanager.com.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:39:12
the gap is huge tho.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:31:39
*grab popcorn*
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:47:59
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:22:46
do you have the address for this question?
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:09:27
i have a love &amp; hate rls with coinbase,  i think everyone feels same.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:39:07
oh so now they blame the low transaction was caused by the large amount of users? but but they have to find a solution, right?
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:34:34
Please sell more !!
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:35:05
"some of them even have a working websites" hahahaha was he serious?
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:31:31
wait for it.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:22:45
agree with comments above, they're people like us, but they're responsible for such high status in life so they try every method to stop, control, manipulate us as much as possible
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:43:59
no, it doesn't decrease electrical usage. where did u get it?
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:55:14
Yeah, I think some are doing same thing. Who knows it's gon moon in next many months.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:26:59
Tax free oh la la
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:41:08
It helps transactions faster and cheaper, simple as it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:37:09
tell me about it hahaha!
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:45:48
Seem there's no proper answer/solutions for this issue, cuz it's not popular to the mass yet.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:10:52
Cracking me up.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:18:32
Awesome, I'm so pumped to see how they're meet each other.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:38:56
Great work, keep it up with your work!
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:11:53
I wonder the same :(
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:20:52
they were so cute and less aggressive back then hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:53:02
maybe it's gon be pricey, but i can't assume that quick
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:27:29
Gemini &amp; Gdax.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:20:16
That's how it works, and stocks, and anything that drops.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:22:57
at least they want to learn something new.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:51:58
Your professor is uber cool. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:54:52
Welcome always, glad u've enjoyed that
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:54:03
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:12:19
nothing too major changed
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:46:27
I don't think so, either he admits it himself, or else, false accusation.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:03:37
As long as it doesn't drop double !
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:47:56
hahaha, genius!
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:52:33
Indeed! Unless there're official statements.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:36:16
sorry about your dad.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:04:51
It's ok honey, just don't get it on Coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:37:33
That could include testing too.
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:52:01
what a truly beautiful post. thanks! i've learn alot!
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:45:45
More good news everyday
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:16:26
It doesn't matter tbh :D
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:54:13
oh thanks, keep updating!
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:36:53
hope you will get it fixed soon.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:57:59
Better watch out!
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:02:46
it's Binance though.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:37:08
non stop rant about the fee up to now, don't they have any solution?
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:30:48
I wonder same thing for years
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:25:04
Simple, put a limit.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:09:53
Now buy!
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:10:57
i don't think it'll affect much the value. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:05:58
a little left for segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:50:50
While this news hits hard, I don't think some understand their purpose of investing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:12:14
mine is btcmanager.com
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:05:17
Aren't all cryptocurrencies like gambling for now?
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:19:41
No proper source?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:14:23
That dream team!
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:43:59
agree, why would they follow china's step which is completely nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:25:18
just stfu, needless for claiming.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:42:42
It's so amazing! I never thought it could be that much.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:04:44
Sorry to hear it, hope it's alright for you at the end.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:40:47
To be cheap is necessary since you guys won't stop complaining about the fees.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:27:17
i bet all of them would mask "i-told-you-so" to start their rants, but why have to? It ain't their money, their decisions lol. Respect.
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:56:16
no way!!!
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:16:13
that's such a nice poster, where did u purchase it?
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:01:45
My friends had to wait even longer, so switch to another dude.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:35:27
im here for reading, learning, and researching new knowledge about cryptocurrencies, am i counted?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:23:52
it's gambling undercover hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:08:56
$11 is quite a deal
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:15:54
i would refresh the page all the times, it's annoying!
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:37:21
I would choose "anti-terrorism" XD
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:38:48
I didn't know there are anonymous bank accounts there
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:23:09
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:10:18
it's possible to get spammed.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:40:07
Don't tell people what to doooo
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:04:22
there're lots of things to do when first step in crypto markets, but first, save your time doing research rather than writing such a long post lol  but good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:47:03
It ain't panic to sell bitcoin now.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:20:36
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:13:18
this never gets old i swear xD
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:30:02
overall, whatever he claims &amp; states shouldn't affect us. this aint how we work
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:58:37
thank for your question, i finally found my answers :')
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:55:33
Not like that
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:43:44
Hold for everyone.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:44:14
bitcoin to me, is new invention, that thank to it, i've witness lots of different layers of emotions within everybody lol
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:30:55
I need proper proofs or else it's all invalid. Meh
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:15:25
How arrogant lol
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:23:48
yeahh, you need to be super careful with these scammers, they know that cryptocurrencies is expanding so they won't leave a chance to steal, hate it!
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:30:31
are you sure?
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:14:52
Hope it's going to work well
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:59:17
I feel you bro!
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:01:23
am i missing some good dramas?
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:15:06
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:59:39
that's a great idea. do you have any further yet?
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:26:18
The future is now!
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:27:08
It is, try it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:10:20
no, they tax on all trades u've made, not single one, just like u buy something and the tax is applied on the total = same thing as taxing on individual thing.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:39:03
oh hell I see what they did there. Such a dilemma hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:46:00
quite ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:22:13
Ledger or Trezor.
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:58:55
Sadly I own no coin enough to purchase a whole house.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:05:15
it depends on the size of your transaction, likely fixed price :P
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:34:46
Well singapore has lots of rich people, so no prb!
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:25:48
Yeah, it's down, but soon recover.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:11:04
I know right! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:17:27
Sounds about neither wrong nor right. People should stop this comparison game.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:57:13
We're basically screwed cuz of these future thingy smh.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:59:05
no, i don't mind with all the rollercoaster things, it's risky of course, it's how investment is supposed to be
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:30:06
There will plenty of free trading but can't be absolute.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:21:31
Interesting article with cool content =&gt; click bait.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:33:43
Or this: 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:18:16
hahaha what an irony.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:17:06
cuz he's rich.....
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:58:20
half of them overslept...
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:44:45
I wanna see great things for bitcoin but not everyone's pleased or do get it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:09:50
Yes, this is the point of why it grows. What's new?.......
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:49:41
Yeah, they apply regulations to get some profits there. I see youu
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:31:27
when the mempool isn't backlogged, the fees will only drop., which won't happen if a single exchange implements segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:43:58
Nevermind, it's still blue to me :(
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:53:30
In the end, they won't have any real solution I bet.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:01:14
any proof??
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:43:30
More like isolation hahaha, at least read some news about the price tendency.

@_date: 2018-01-11 16:04:43

@_date: 2018-01-25 11:29:44

@_date: 2018-01-10 13:39:13

@_date: 2018-01-22 09:35:35
True! I don't get it either, just enjoy it!
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:07:05
hahaha, the price so far is quite stable, it's what i see
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:08:20

@_date: 2018-01-25 11:50:46
$185k? let's pause and reconsider, but having a fund is not bad, yet it's slow.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:18:51
have you tried restarting it?
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:46:25
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:56:15

"Exchanges are the key to mass adoption of Lightning" --- excluding Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:35:56
Suppy &amp; demand are parts of it
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:22:42
Quite meh to me
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:51:57
what a piece of s***
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:06:46
the past has no affect on the present and future though.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:07:14
no, obviously
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:33:07
I will wait.
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:25:21
hahaha, you've watched many dramas, if they point a gun at your head to get the pin, u don't, and they shoot u, chance they all lose both sides. unless it's tracking face feature like new iphone, you don't have to worry lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:08:36
half this half that you can't be 100% sure, just be careful
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:15:57
Of course, this is awesome time to buy all the cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:50:17

@_date: 2018-01-10 13:02:22

How they fight against the ban
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:10:28
too bad that you didn't hahah
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:34:50

@_date: 2018-01-02 08:13:10

@_date: 2018-01-11 16:38:25

@_date: 2018-01-09 10:12:53

@_date: 2018-01-10 12:56:23
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:53:06
nothing i can do but upvoting for you to get noticed :))

@_date: 2018-01-09 10:05:29
lil cutie!
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:01:33
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:07:47

@_date: 2018-01-26 15:02:01
That's not going to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:21:29
Gemini! 
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:17:34
My friends? They never told me xD
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:57:32
That's how it should go, I've always thought about it. Now it's realll
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:18:50
at least he admitted what he'd stated.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:44:28
it's why i say, you decide your own life when it comes to financial decisions. it's important.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:42:25
Let's do it!
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:37:07
wow, first time ever i saw he's resurfaced.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:54:06
Yes, I never think so. Needless for statement.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:29:24
Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:11:58
needless for decentralized exchanges
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:41:52
Great job man.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:46:51
Happy New Year

Yet I'm still worried lol
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:31:46
It's just the beginning of everything.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:24:21
Lightning network, it's been working so well
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:50:21
Poor you.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:45:02
you make profit, you get taxed. deal with it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:30:24
1/4 doesn't mean you save 75%, it could be less.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:46:26
How many do you think it's going to hit this week on total?
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:45:20
No surprise buddy, glad that you've enjoyed it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:13:54

@_date: 2018-01-03 13:28:49

@_date: 2018-01-03 13:26:13

@_date: 2018-01-11 06:39:56
they're doing good.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:19:52
hahahaha who cares.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:08:10

@_date: 2018-01-05 07:14:44

@_date: 2018-01-22 08:09:08

Not yet.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:35:36

@_date: 2018-01-01 13:16:20
 you might need this
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:47:03
we gotta see how good it's gon work to evaluate the result. but anws, big hope though.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:44:37
Good luck with your business
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:08:49

@_date: 2018-01-26 15:05:12
Such a raw story from you. I feel so sorry, good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:47:47
Put it 101 book about Cryptocurrency if any. hahah
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:29:31
it's so scarily accurate lol 
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:26:06
poor you guys
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:52:21
So it's a scam?
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:11:50
well, there are tons of coins behind them alr, it's matter of time.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:20:27
i heard it's bitpanda.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:47:04
Temporary only
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:55:03
are you sure it's legit? it looks super shady to me
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:45:03
but they're likely harmless though.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:56:00
it means "bad luck"
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:47:19
well, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:41:04
wowow!!! happy birthday, but can i ask what it's that cake flavor? :P
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:15:36
Forever it is.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:06:09
im for the lambo, if ever...
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:32:43
not smart enough.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:27:31
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:11:10
which side should i buy, they keep stating this and switching to other side.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:42:35
So this's going to be forever, or it's going down in flames.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:55:10
Hope it works out well
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:54:30
when it crashes, no happy dream for them.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:56:28
maybe she is not interested in it? i mean, if you don't fully believe in something, the interest and excitement is zero, isn't it? but maybe you could talk it out with her oneday, hopefully she'd understand, but there's some hobbies and passions that we can't expect everyone to understand, let's figure out what is her special hobby and passions, try if you could understand it rather than asking her to get you in return, right?
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:28:59
OMG it's so awesome. Thank for sharing!
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:23:05
Nooo thanks hahaha

@_date: 2018-01-01 13:19:40
nice post!
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:45:30
why it shows up there is mysterious lol, but to let coinmarketcap takes over is gon be quite a time.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:04:54
Currently, it's $440 hello
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:28:11
Well well well 1% is a lot to compare with the amount of transactions in total.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:14:00
hahahaha, within 24 hrs haha
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:26:40
Lots of debates about it, yet no one want it to be fixed.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:56:16
OTC market.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:39:42
yeah, shady to me. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:12:54
happy new year!
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:54:34
How many do you think it will cross by this week?
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:51:09
Facebook coin anyone? xD
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:25:51
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:12:34
looking for answer as you are
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:07:31
No ban ever!
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:52:08
er that doesn't make sense lol
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:44:17
man, i miss those old times. where is it??
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:09:34
thank for sharing, it's what i need for my research.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:29:23
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:03:48
Well done, that's you need to do, taking advantages.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:47:47
the fact it pays your fee is everything,right?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:09:20
There's panic for FUD LOL
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:50:44
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:53:26
Sad I know.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:01:11
wait a bit longer.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:11:19
well, have you heard about "tax"
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:13:14
ohhh i remember it, i thought those answers could help u out a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:38:38
just your luck but 20 mins is way too fast, to compare with how long others had to wait in vain.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:02:40
how about just stop using it?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:47:13
of course i won't trust a bot to control, manage, plan my money. i just don't feel comfy at all.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:18:49
er, of course!
happy new year!
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:20:11
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:22:38
Big money on the game.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:26:05
if it's true, imagine how big it'll be
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:25:23
sorry, hope u will get it fixed soon
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:41:26
It has nothing to do with all of that
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:42:29
i guess it's abt 3 years.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:54:45
i know that fee can't be zero, but at least affordable
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:24:39
Just do it good.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:10:33
i didn't expect this.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:57:44
I don't see it as a good growth, I see it shady somehow. Laundering money?
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:51:31
Seem like I'm the only one who didn't see any bad to bitch about. Stay calm buddies.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:45:24
good sharing, and good luck
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:06:43
I love it hahha. Make my day.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:40:33
Tips on holding? Just relax and do nothing hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:03:47
it is safe, but some privacy is not there.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:19:22
oh well, they made triple profits...
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:31:05
but there're a few that are really in charge of the coins though, do i make sense or not?
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:17:01
no, bitcoin doesn't work like banks, you got it wrong from the very beginning.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:11:57
Chinese did it!
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:13:40
saw 1 guy got banned and keeps posting on other forum hahaha.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:59:19
my friends don't mind hodling cuz they don't feel like trading lol...lazy indeed.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:54:00
oh it's great, considering there're many customers are owning bitcoin, would bring you a fortune later.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:50:12
would u invest more?
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:34:14
less then 5 mins is impressive, enough :P
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:28:48
regardless what others say, hold for me
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:45:28
OOOOOh, I've found the answers. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:29:34
Thanks huge!
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:01:29
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:19:46
no solution yet.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:06:15
no, diamonds are forever, cuz u can actually use and trade and sell it with higher profits every time
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:22:13
Oh thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:45:20
Er, I don't get it xD
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:47:38
everything is taxed.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:03:14
how long have u been waiting?
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:50:11
have anyone reported it? it's serious for losing for no reason. they're broken yet get our money?
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:01:00
sometimes it doesn't correctly apply.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:17:36
no it depends on how much of your transaction, not depend on the up &amp; down value going through time.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:37:56
for sure.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:11:54
unless you've sold, u don't have to face the tax
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:06:16
20 out of 10 lol
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:07:28
hahaha, nothing is that easy.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:49:48
impossible at my point of view.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:01:21
Thanks for the tutorial
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:27:47
less volatility can't be biased.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:10:42
it must be hard for you.
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:43:47
hahaha! where did u come up with?
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:36:17
wow, new year with new achievement.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:55:00
0r $500
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:49:45
However, I have a really fair view of all coins, each coin has its own purposes. So, you shouldn't assume one coin is better than others.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:49:55
True hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:53:16
Yeah, took quite a time to offer this *sigh*
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:33:15
oh shhhhh i forgot it! anw, happy birthday!
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:10:26
yeah, something like car selling accepts bitcoin would be a breakthrough movement. kudo to it
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:07:10
agree with you, at least hodl for 1 year. keep trading them makes tons of profits for miners in general
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:40:49
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:02:58
Wait for it!
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:19:40
i want more features, not just prices.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:11:01
do we need a protest for this??? do we do we??
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:38:25
That'll be sooner than May. March I think
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:25:27
but that graphic resembles Nike :P

@_date: 2017-12-19 09:00:54
money u can't touch 
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:13:51
but the possibility of bitcoin to be the biggest and most important currency in the world is not guaranteed yet. you can't tell the future, it's right but some people are still highly doubtful of the true core value of cryptocurrencies overall.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:46:35
wizard is awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:09:27
sorry to hear his story, hope everything fine!
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:36:09
Sorry for your loss, I hope that you will mentally and physically (if any) recover soon from the incident. Wish you all the best of luck!
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:37:20
i should take a look at the fee again i think!
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:29:21
don't think so
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:21:53
just enough, not more or less.

@_date: 2017-12-20 15:55:59
later consideration
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:18:56
not a big deal tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:17:37
true, the fee terrors me!
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:42:04
we must fight backkkk
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:08:58
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:07:03
Sorry that you must go thru all of this. Would like to know how is everything turning around for you. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:45:47

@_date: 2017-12-12 09:57:59
Just be careful next time dude.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:46:28
same issue here
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:13:13
I'm so happy for you. We all are!
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:37:38
gotta be strong tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:52:49
$50 is too much!
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:42:33
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:01:24
wait? but the last time i checked, it was at around $18k??? when did it happennn
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:39:56
you have to wait until people widely use bitcoin, then it'll be his year
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:02:43
it could be
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:58:00
couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:08:46
keep hodling on
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:44:09
oh you've pointed out one thing i've wondered long time: where is the tax?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:41:15
it's why you should have got it when it was cheaper
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:19:33
i still need confirmations for all of what you've claimed. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:29:46
yup....the fee has alw been so messy
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:34:07
thumb up!
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:29:50
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:22:32
if it doesn't work, wait until it works. however, just wait.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:04:14
too much
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:49:18
oh i thought that central banks hate bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:47:05
tell us the result soon!
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:14:08
more proofs!
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:10:21
Cuz no one knows the future.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:21:25
Wait until the value is higher.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:04:36
lucky you!
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:01:54
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:20:23
at least he's still left with $9k
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:01:07
I just think it's their policy (well, anywhere has their own policies anw) to get payment under 15 mins but they forget to count the risk of the payment is not received, sometimes it's blocked or some sort of it. The best solution is to raise the amount of time I think, up to 30 mins, but anw, up to their choice and decisions!
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:35:07
unless you have decent amount of money, or else...no..
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:56:18
$50,000 is too much, i think it's gon reach around $25,000
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:10:24
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:39:41
that makes me nervous @_@
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:30:10
interesting to read
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:49:01
Gemini all the way
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:38:00
keep holding on
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:03:17
it is! but it's only cryptocurrencies, it's not (yet) widely used as papermoney, so shame on them
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:09:05
good warning
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:52:18
i didn't!
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:14:14
so useful dude
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:33:43
5 yr
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:02:48
looking for answers too
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:13:56
Let's celebrate!!!
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:09:00
that's what i'm gon do as well, not telling anyone too much info about how much you earn/have in your pocket!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:40
is it better??
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:43:53
me feel you
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:15:58
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:01:52
hahaha just keep it, no worries!
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:47:16
your point is right, cuz you can't predict future beforehand. it's risky we all know that, but again, we can't tell.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:40:14
let's carefully consider about it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:41:50
im also curious
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:04:02
I suggest you to use Google sine every basic information is pretty summed up there. Overall, Bitcoin is digital currency which is not owned by anyone, any bank in between, you own it yourself. Nowadays, it's accepted as a payment via some online websites. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:59:08
omg hahaha. how could you come with this xD
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:18:59
hope it'll get more upvote. no worries!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:21:06
are we there yet?
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:48:06
they believe what they wanna
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:35:05
wait for it!
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:36:31
how's about 6.5k?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:45
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:46:07
Gold market is the main market since the civilization was born. It seems impossible to replace though, it's just my assumption, but it's quite difficult for bitcoin to be as large as gold market which has lasted forever!
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:26:56
mine is instant!
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:49:30
Yeah, what's "dip"?
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:39:04
scary future!
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:30:32
i think
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:35:46
i personally think the fee is quite high.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:34:44
i'll be the next,but i need to evaluate the situation
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:34:05
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:39:06
not sure what's going on tho
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:34:12
YAS she did it right
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:44:48
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:14:30
but others do.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:32:18
switch to online wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:18:53
it just does lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:35:00
is there anything new?
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:17:40
Paper money is used for easier carry since it stands for gold value on the current market which shifts every single day. Bitcoin value is shifting as well, as long as people accept and use it for better and easier benefits, i think it's all fine. don't be too harsh.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:05:58
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:30:31
u still have to purchase it anw
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:44:24
true hahaa
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:51:14
i like this idea,
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:44:45
i really don't like the fee. can it be any lower?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:00:19
I should do it, too
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:56:25
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:48:36
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:43:21

@_date: 2017-12-17 05:04:07
why do u need to identify yourself psst
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:58:02
5K is not much
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:53:31

@_date: 2017-12-19 10:37:30
great result
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:06:01
it's gon be tough
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:51:37
people don't know much about them so they all claim negative opinions about it
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:38:14
lazy one, not really active
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:12:58
what's that for?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:30:42
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:30:58
that's lots of things to discuss.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:59:40
you're gon invest all your savings to btc, right? XD
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:47:35

thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:37:07
not risky for them i personally think
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:44:20
sound about right, but not totally
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:45:02
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:33:08
wait, two groups are different? i thought they're all same
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:41:39
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:40:15
sorry :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:13:17
why not
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:09:56
again, not everyone wants bitcoin as gifts and sometimes clever enough to keep it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:32:59
very nice of you
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:38:04
yeah,what mess?
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:47:59
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:03:29
he's not so clever i assume, just personal opinion so chill outtt
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:57:39
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:25:02
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:47:23
true dat!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:21
let's do it
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:21:53
actually i take it seriously ever since
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:13:37
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:48:48
happy new year
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:56:02

@_date: 2017-12-18 13:31:16
depend 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:39:01
very nice of you!
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:30:49
maybe your thoughts are just different form the majority here. don't worry, just keep up with your inner thoughts. i think the major key of cryptocurrencies is to make people experience new kind of currency that they rightfully own without anything charges and fee (oh there's still transaction fees around), but as it comes to "money" - human beings are often crazy/obsessed over it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:45:29
cool tips!
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:18:16
lucky you!

@_date: 2017-12-14 11:52:20
Less than you've expected!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:49
expensive i think

@_date: 2017-12-17 04:19:20
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:36:45

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:16:25

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:17:54
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:54:45
I've read that Craiglist does accept Bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:39:05
i didn't sell
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:59:37
i wonder same things!
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:32:44
i was same as them. but i took time reading and researching all things possible. now i just get it a bit!
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:27:42
have you tried other ways?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:18
gon cancel T_T
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:10:13
the transfer takes forever irritates me too
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:21
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:57:45
i don't think he must be responsible for the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:30:53
huge loss!
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:52:13
too late
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:26:15
why would people consider bitcoin is for losers only?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:57:07
how lol

@_date: 2017-12-23 09:31:12

@_date: 2017-12-21 10:41:42
not until you fully realize its pontentials
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:23:28
Something is finally rewarded, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:28:43

@_date: 2017-12-23 09:42:14
i hate the fee ughhhh
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:58:30
you have a very insightful quite a writing/post for this issue. i think the reason why btc is not mainstream yet is it's not widely known, as you can see not everyone knows about btc in in specific and cyrptocurrencies in general. some are dead believers, some are just plain doubtful, you gotta choose a side to buy - go hard or go home is the reason of why btc is not mainstream yet.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:19:31
so Ledger, in fact, is never one thing for saving??
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:33:09
Done, mate! Good luck! And yes, bitcoin and blockchain are two different thing. You should reconsider it.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:18:47
so it ait biggie to me cuz im not in italy.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:06:06
quite funny though.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:11:34
I appreciate your help!
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:19:34
Er, it shouldn't be that way.
@_date: 2018-05-16 12:53:13
actually we are fragile as hell!
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:44:14
lol, isn't it so obvious?
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:44:31
can't play it mate.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:10:03
couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:30:32
cool, i will check it later!
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:08:41
I expected 40% but 33% is good!
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:17:51
Whatever he says, Im down to it.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:49:59
It's been a long drive already
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:29:58
Nice visual hahaha
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:26:15
you're so late to the party, whoever made this meme
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:11:13
i bet they won't complain anything.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:15:58
Absolutely agree.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:13:08
Are you sure with that??
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:24:34
it's a vampire lol.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:50:49
I do, I do like his vision.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:18:12
We can make it at any circumstance.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:14:05
hope you have a better memory.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:46:30
Hopefully it makes a good change.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:05:36
sure, nearly a decade is not a long time for such a firm thing like crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:08:07
It can't be undone, andddddd there're competitors for LN?
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:52:08
yup, it's all we can do now lol
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:01:41
aww, thanks for this.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:15:28
I'd love it, too!
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:37:24
i havent laid my hand on this. so i guess  it's a no from me.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:12:32
not a rat for experiments.
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:03:31
thanks, i finally have something to relax at nights.
@_date: 2018-05-16 12:45:56
im the guy who escaped through the ceiling, if he ever did it as escape? lol
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:07:47
dude, you should make a retail business out of this!
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:16:40
I've already made a bet with friends lol
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:49:18
hahahahahahaha, lucky me that i don't have such friend 
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:04:23
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:47:13
Can we get an ELI5?
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:30:55
poor those who have no basic knowledge about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:09:13
My pleasure!
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:52:32
So the fee will be better or nah?
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:24:57
Poor thing!
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:15:01
No it can't, or never. However,if it can, not in "10 years". Cash is still the main method in 97% daily basis. You expect people from poor countries will afford digital wallet? Really?
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:26:00
No, never hahaahha
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:07:34
damn, that set up of that store is perf! let alone bitcoin sign.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:35:51
they could have done more damage than that. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:49:31
I hope it will be going on smoothly than before.
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:06:29
i miss that old time, so much peaceful, wasn't it?
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:14:48
I love these risky guys!
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:29:27
I used to guess they could only sell like, half of it.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:49:39
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:15:22
Finally i've waited for so long
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:57:20
what is the use of it in that game? like inserting bitcoin like coins, etc?
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:17:49
but without blockchain, there's no bitcoin....right?
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:24:05
Only 4mil BTC left!
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:55:57
This is quite interesting.
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:17:17
I no longer trust these guys lol ,just because you wear suits it equals as professional and trust worthy.
@_date: 2018-05-16 12:55:10
likely they've cancelled it, right? and so afraid of declaring it.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:26:20
It looks soooooooooooooooo nice!
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:42:48
it will stay stable, neither up nor down.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:58:25
you think they really lost that whooping amount of 21 TRILLION without ranting about it? it was used for super shady and fishy stuff.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:28:57
I love him though!
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:18:44
they can only sell it to certain number of consumers who actually use crypto in general, so i guess it's fail somehow.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:06:06
Major ouch!
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:20:04
what, no unsubscribe??? lol i stuck there forever
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:14:08
Cool instruction. Please make more (to anyone ever did it)
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:25:21
I always, forever wonder how does he feel now.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:46:10
As fast as youcan!
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:40:16
Or using bitcoin cash i suggest?
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:33:01
Small step but make big movements.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:28:33
Yes, I forget about inflation too, but to change completely everything which is already in its order is quite a hard task.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:11:49
so pleasing!
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:48:58
Congratulation! Im not there xD
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:57:00
Ok, im not on any side, but that is misleading as hell?
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:15:24
No thanks! Even zero fee.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:15:21
True, that joke is old.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:32:15
China gov is going make them suffer lol
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:47:05
bitcoin can sponsor cuz it works based on certain scheme of "benefit" flows. some people won't get this? gee!
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:17:56
Please hurry!
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:43:39
GO MONTREAL!
@_date: 2018-05-16 12:52:33
but this passion lasts forever in me? :(
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:37:15
The gold is the right example and OG to compare all of this.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:31:01
Meh, give me a lower number and i will believe.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:06:12
Hear it guys, chill everyone xD
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:04:30
Guys, we weren't on the Moon atm.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:54:14
i understand credit, but ban debit, seriously? it's our money ffs.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:36:46
6 months is a bit too short, don't you think?
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:44:56
ugh, yeah, if it was 5 years ago approximately.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:26:02
It will revive!
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:22:22
"sounds a little risky" ok good!
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:14:22
Still need a house.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:19:28
when will it be good times again?
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:07:18
i wonder how he must feel now? wait, is he still alive?
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:45:19
i thought they used to list bitcoin core, so no? it's bitcoin cash now!
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:26:52
Where is the 100th??
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:20:23
You should sue them!
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:43:18
Not really...
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:16:21
There's manipulation lol, you think life is just that easy and rainbow?
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:13:38
I hope so, it will change lots of people's lives for the best!
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:47:05
He has spoken and we should stop panic.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:15:09
OMG!!! Make more of this.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:32:38
Look at that ultimate blue?
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:15:51
Bitcoin: "Let me live".......
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:43:16
the government issue is not that low lol
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:13:27
with the explanation,still i don't get "sound money".
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:56:22
Fill it up!
@_date: 2018-05-16 12:46:20
how is the reward?
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:18:16
Hold on, we will survive!
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:45:42
dude, you believe everything made up in such movie? HOLLYWOOD MOVIE?
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:04:57
True. But they refuse the truth
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:14:36
I must hold on tight, no panic sell!
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:07:16
the title is so shady in many ways
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:14:44
unlikely "most" imo.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:11:42
Now that's what I call "classic"!
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:11:23
hahaha this should be a long series named "have you seen bitcoin?"
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:14:57
now it's too late....
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:31:54
hahahahahahahha! what is this vid from?
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:07:44
I feel pity for him at short moment, but gone!
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:18:39
How is it now?
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:27:02
Where is the 100th??
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:25:40
marketing tells alot about one project.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:11:56
someone should make use of this as an art and make profits from it cuz it's stunning.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:48:50
thing is i don't see many people would choose to end war rather than keeping making a fuss out of it. ALWAYS
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:11:31
yeah, would love to read your update.
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:08:14
not yet a revolution, but early adoption imo.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:06:27
Too soon, man. Chill out!
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:15:10
So, being artist now requires a lot!

As an OG, it should be staying where it is.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:07:15
At least it could help them out of unstable state of living.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:52:24

@_date: 2018-05-03 16:12:49

@_date: 2018-05-11 08:25:36
can they make an easier to understand title??? seriously, needless to put so many negative in one short sentence.
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:27:29
i agree with him at the movie part, why do they keep making them? reminding? lol no? step up your game.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:11:18
Im not ready for it yet!
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:23:44
yes, it's an abstraction but it works more than just being one - until now, right Wired?
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:10:38
hahahahahahahahahhaahahah omg what is thiss?? exorcise?
@_date: 2014-01-17 23:16:01
Do they own enough that this ETF could have a direct significant impact on the bitcoin market?
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:31:14
good project! i will def check it out later.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:08:35
Another drama of the day. i await for it.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:49:25
fake positive is the worst i may say.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:12:07
Is it trustable?
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:50:25
Aside from your quit, this one is good.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:16:13
They can have more!
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:09:35
It looks cute!
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:12:52
I did.!
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:42:58
it will stay stable, neither up nor down.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:38:13
stay away from anywhere offer shady "wallet".
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:06:33
this cracked me up!
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:12:35
hahahahhaahaha but that should be the only way to say it is what it is.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:24:15
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:25:44
I avoid it as much as possible.
@_date: 2014-03-16 12:06:50
Invite me too please
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:17:20
they even lied to themselves sooo
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:47:55
I would name mine "FUD0" hahaha! If only I have a Lambo
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:35:58
Bootstrap is super easy to use. Plus I have been sitting on that domain.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:58:08
;just wait
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:01:35
cuz everything that goes up, must come down. just very basic thing happens in life.
@_date: 2014-05-07 21:09:05
Thats like saying that the internet was not revolutionary just because we still use print. It has its place, you dont have to take over to be revolutionary. We can use them as credit or prepaid cards and still change the world.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:09:22
Bam!  
Also some suggestions for more predictions would be good. I want to get at least 6 people up there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:28:19
the point is to keep your head up
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:37:35
this sounds promising but gotta wait.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:27:43
tho it couldn't be proven to be working well, at least it's worth giving a shot
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:23:20
so we get more volume.
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:37:18
right at your corner is no longer on theory lol
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:28:12
Even Cardano?? Sweet!
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:38:12
that's the future lol
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:40:19
i heard he would return it.
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:29:14
so far, any update?
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:26:17
the biggest coin of all in the picture is bitcoin,
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:43:38
one of the great news lately, or just my today
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:36:49
the name says it all: as fast as lightning
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:46:40
to me, it's funny lol
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:46:50
it's not a bad idea but quite useless just for a coke? i mean, im pretty opposed to any idea to use crypto for such little goods.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:45:36
but they have been adopting too many yet making use it properly, right?
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:38:08
we're still talking about the price now? dudes, move on.!
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:46:49
make a proper education is the best option rather than shoving tons of info into one's head.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:04:04
great tips, good luck with your business
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:47:52
many out there but what do you wanna purchase?
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:35:07
many negative abt bisq.io . duh, anything needs to be tried u know.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:46:16
It Is Happening!
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:47:16
definitely go for it.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:43:54
awesome tho!
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:18:41
good new but why i didn't see it anywhere recently?
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:39:09
In fact, Baht........
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:41:22
ugh, what a shame??
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:37:39
you should make your own blog. great one.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:38:42
there's no such sign to prove it's Bitcoin lol!
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:31:02
hm, i think i will figure it out later.
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:55:01
it could be but not right now, i think it will proceed a long long long time to be there, since people are still gossipping about how fragile/dangerous bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:22:47
well it's worth their effort.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:48:15
of course anything needs to be regulated, 100% or half way it doesn't matter! 
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:26:19
wish it could be really stable at high price lol
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:44:52
but the fact is people are enjoying it, duh? nuff saying.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:35:18
well lightning has always been good though
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:52:32
it's not yet to be widely accepted, i think?
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:11:57
after years, it deserves what it deserves.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:47:27
i have realized that there's no movie about bitcoin whatsoever, it could be a good topic to work on.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:40:56
so when will it be applied accordingly?
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:39:48
without the rise of the btc, without dinner too.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:45:53
you might need to submit this at job related subs though. goodluck
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:53:36
wow, many efforts was made recently. hope they all work out greatly.
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:58:18
someone is being sneaky around.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:00:25
it should be optional, not compulsory, not everyone wants that
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:41:45
which is not but still counted at some points.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:06:37
so what's the tax has anything to do with it now?
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:18:31
this may take me forever to understand.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:02:09
Lightning network is a best solution for now. why people are wondering still?
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:20:41
Same thought but i thought it was just me...
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:51:55
Ok now i should be worrying!
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:48:13
Now grab yourself a bitcoin atm everyone lol
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:41:41
Thank you for this mate.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:23:23
Welcome to india, where the law is ridiculous, including that they don't even care about there're many rapes happening everyday, never care about arresting the rapists and such, then you know that to these issues, they don't even care.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:53:41
many atms in one place and just 2,3 of them in big place they should learn how to distribute it better.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:07:30
cuz it's a small start but means a lot to him, so?
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:44:13
hahahaha should have been straight to the point oh dear.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:23:43
LOL, good tips.!
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:18:07
bitcoin is not security fyi.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:21:28
it's bcash shhhh!
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:55:57
 Everyone is running around trying to understand why bitcoin is important or why it will work or why they even bought some in the first place. The answer is this one reason. Its supply is absolutely strictly limited. If you own 1 out of 21 million bitcoin today you will still own 1 out of 21 million bitcoin in 50 years from now. No one can dilute the supply. 
\-\-\- agree with this one, owning bitcoin is like forever.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:47:20
just keep it regular, shall we.
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:20:02
i have heard not many good feedbacks about this company tho.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:08:00
you hardly lose, if considering bitcoin as payment, people love that, for now.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:14:05
hahahahahaha why does this guy always have something interesting to talk about, make us debate?
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:14:57
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:35:58
Bill Gates doesn't like Bitcoin! or Crypto!
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:53:54
so it's a co existence relationship.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:23:54
Anything else? Sun is hot?
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:12:28
lol, seriously i subscribe his channel so i know what im saying fyi. not only this one video.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:01:26
they do what they wanna do.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:54:58
let's wait
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:21:54
congrats!! how do you plan on using them now?
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:10:30
actually it's not that bad lol
@_date: 2018-06-05 08:08:29
i remember when lightning was just an idea, now it's grown so much.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:46:54
How much &amp; of payment will be made there as they expect it to happen?
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:08:23
it's why it stopped workin for a while back then
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:17:43
6 months wil fly fast if you just ignore it and enjoy the hold!
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:40:20
and how made this happen is still a big mystery.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:12:26
and progress without good result, then it's not how things should progress.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:44:10
hahahahha you wish.
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:55:36
to me, if you have strong belief regardless, watching these doesn't help much. very constructive comment, well done.
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:58:25
I don't think so, I think blockchain is one of the great inventions. Which bear bitcoin and many following techs.
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:58:56
it happens in my place, too. how ridiculous it could get? INFINITY!
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:05:35
hahaha netflix and chill??
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:11:53
guess what, i know little about it so it's why.. thank for your consideration.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:43:05
Tell me a better trio!
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:49:38
oh yes, maybe some instant error, now i can play it well. don't worry!
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:21:45
Yup, it's right thing to do lol, why do they waste so many times.
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:07:33
easy, they just wanna have all nodes,as many as they can.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:44:48
What's the definition of "pure bitcoin"???
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:04:44
I adore him somehow
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:46:02
Chill, mate. Not that terrible.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:17:12
oh nah, news from china, how could i believe them lolololol
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:10:24
ah yes, maybe you're right, his meaning is a bit unclear to me. thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:02:42
true, mass adoption is happening everywhere and it should be one thing we're happy and confident about now.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:39:47
We want that too sir!
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:46:10
depending on regulations. it takes a lot to go all in
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:49:43
i get it mate, i don't get it sometimes and to be honest, i never spend a single payment by bitcoin overall. it's not worth it.
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:44:38
hahahaha no, i can't risk the fun!
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:39:12
and it's a good sign!
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:51:52
ah you're right, i was a bit confused with the idea.
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:54:28
yes, my inner wish :O
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:58:49
why we keep hearing news about how terrible china acts toward crypto?
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:22:17
that's crazy for $22!
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:47:17
omg that amount of money......i wish!
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:21:02
no, $0 Trillion
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:52:55
why does it sound bullish to me.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:53:23
Congrats! Would you buy more?
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:39:11
Yes,there are some people doing that, but we can't catch them.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:54:13
So this makes my brain work a little bit comparing to these days it's so off.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:42:42
how are feeling better now?
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:04:39
So for now they've made up their minds?
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:13:30
what a shame!
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:43:11
soon that banner will be filled with more cryptos!
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:46:13
i understand it but nothing will change.
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:08:11
anyone here hoping the price will go up like me for now, desperately?
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:35:12
so making more lightning wallets is a thing now?
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:42:42
And now just in June, we're feeling so hopeless.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:45:31
so it's official already or just around the debate?
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:50:55
Kinda like it, "kinda" because i haven't tried it
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:47:27
and they said there's a ban in china, they said it will serious.
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:09:42
But now it's been switched and turned.
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:50:30
TRUE, finally someone said the truth and backflashed at these ridiculous statements!
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:48:40
hahaha thing is i don't ever answer unknown calls offering hey here your btc take it, how stupid one should be to believe that??
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:46:44
actually it looks even better than real lambo lol
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:53:01
but i really like the concept of this story a modern tale about a digital currency.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:11:08
we all prefer a lil pump
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:05:10
the best one is hold and go meditate hoping it will rise!
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:43:39
We know, it's why they are trying hard to give more bans as many as possible.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:02:34
Of course they are, it's an adoption for now.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:09:45
totally agree.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:16:31
oh yes, timing attack resistant sounds niceee
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:04:18
it's a triangle scheme and we need to break it.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:36:41
Millions cuz there will be million of people watch World Cup, tell me about it.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:38:31
it dies and comes back all the times!
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:09:56
actually Nick Sazbo has a great vision for everything so far.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:56:41
Be careful with all the crashes and panic sell period, you're fine.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:52:29
hopefully it's real cuz for now, i dont know who i should trust hahaha
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:42:15
better never give them to your family anyways lol
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:09:28
it's rational of what he said, but using the term "pure" for bitcoin is weird.
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:09:19
Good one mate! Hope you keep it up cuz we need these!
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:58:02
He means: Internet's currency?
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:56:19
I was reading the headline and was confused, then i saw it lol
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:51:33
nowadays people can say whatever they want but the thing is they're likely clueless about it.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:19:44
one of my friends sent it for around 25 sent.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:44:07
wish go back to 2011 lol
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:51:45
oh yeah, it's what paypal for.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:10:58
same back to you
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:10:25
maybe they didn't have intention to do that, just automatic involving related keywords, not a single staff sit there to ban any shady account, i think.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:26:38
they're not amazon's rival duh
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:13:26
make more of there please!
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:56:34
the name is misleading to me all the time.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:33:22
mass emails sending to mass people out there, they think some will eat the baits.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:11:28
too fast leading to early running out of interest.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:20:21
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:49:45
i live for the design tho.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:53:19
it's just shady in many levels.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:15:53
now i know what to do. !!!
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:21:43
they've been trolling alot lately.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:19:19
true, some people just REFUSE to get facts straight.
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:02:32
the price is good so yeah, try!
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:34:54
when will this be over?

@_date: 2018-03-06 09:47:17
i love hearing him talking.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:20:43

@_date: 2018-03-12 12:50:23
i'm impressed!
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:45:55
i don't even want to guess private key. done.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:48:23
plain text seed is not right, right?
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:37:41
yup, use it is more affective.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:51:53
they want to compete real bad
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:00:22
he got points tho i never know about him
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:28:47
oh gee, i wonder how much money they really have.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:34:28
wow, you're so quick to accuse someone being dumb lol
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:19:06
ohhh, another scandal of coinbase, not so surprised.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:44:11
omg huge news!
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:49:20
See how Amazon is now? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:47:38
when will it be worldwide? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:18:00
anything coinbase has achieved lately makes me question alot.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:29:30
but amazon hasn't yet
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:05:12
great story to share but now we're still in confusion
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:27:05
Thanks! Good luck too
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:56:19
it's all wrong omg!
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:01:17
never ever heard about this, ever!
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:46:23
We're in march now...
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:15:10
i don't think i can anymore :O
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:47:21
i thought it'd be more?
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:17:37
wowowow, how did it go?
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:06:19
Hello the site has nothing there
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:19:26
so this is even a thing?
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:13:31
so basically borrow fiat to buy more bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:10:01
they mean that they wanna sort of controlling bitcoin? how? could? they? what do they think?
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:20:01
I didn't even know this exists?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:54:39
Roll it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:04:13
Can we stop being over-dramatic hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:42:07
They just described how BTC is.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:49:37
could be, not will be far.
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:02:03
another high is coming i believe
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:55:38
basically never seen a hashtag refund for any drop of any crypto lol
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:23:04
ok so they're trying their best to adopt bitcoin but the whole process of paying tax with crypto is forever shady to me
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:18:15
maybe it's just his own decisions, can't judge
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:16:29
i already suspect that they really do that, but no proof, yes now we all know.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:55:25
it's impossible to detect it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:35:37
decentralization for the win
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:54:46
i def have many "no" for this.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:48:03
i can't trust this! lol i don't know but it doesn't seem good to me.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:50:56
no, same as i expected.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:19:17
one word: huge.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:55:45
sorry but even it's true, it can't.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:11:48
why is it the picture of a museum in the headline, yeah whatever.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:15:25
well, cuz they're very different things
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:16:26
bitcoin is also anti-communism "foundation"
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:24:43
we can make ittt
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:56:29
AGREE 100%
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:40:43
people have their own uses duh
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:27:27
if so, all crypto are. why only bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:21:33
hopefully it could work
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:49:10
Surpassing gold? I don't think so cuz it's solid,while bitcoin is not
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:36:35
chill, just for fun.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:14:05
am i the only one who thinks this project with such name will do no good?
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:58:20
fake as hell, try harder next time.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:24:31
or this could be a new crisis, right?
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:21:11
can't believe it really happen!
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:12:19
it's not steady but stable.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:48:27
yup, start with simple plan like that.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:18:13
so don't read them!
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:32:21
"nears"??? but when ?
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:23:26
hopefully more volume.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:30:27
good luck with her business!
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:45:23
what an awesome story!
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:30:15
everyone should learn about basic trade.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:29:28
it's certainly for your own use
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:13:43
does anyone here read forbes's articles about bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:30:48
i don't know, but i don't for real
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:53:05
i remember there will be a transaction service using normal phone network
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:41:01
you must make more of these.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:48:47
this's old but still golden.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:07:01
hahaha eventually.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:48:33
congrats all the way
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:47:11
i no longer feel the panic, im free!!!!
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:51:28
depending on the markets?
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:56:06
does coinbase have anything to do with this?
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:08:42
and i have a bad feeling about it.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:08:34
i've learn alot from this guy. always love his speech and interviews.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:08:07
i think we're at it now?
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:28:53
the conflict on this post is phenomenal. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:19:23
but they're not good lately...
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:53:39
"Customers will be able to invest once per month and withdraw once every quarter."
every quarter is long??
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:05:27
wait, we can put a bitcoin atm there?
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:11:02
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:19:28
shame on them!
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:55:39
i would love to join too but got no time haha
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:14:57
nice to see what they were trying hard.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:33:56
Hahaha true, but that saying is still valid!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:15:44
He did hold tight.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:37:30
gee, this is like, months months ago
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:26:21
make that coin look more sexy hahaha
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:34:48
true, 1, 3 or bc1 is all fine.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:01:50
i heard it's still in the test?
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:50:30
Is it weird since no one mentions about Lightning network anymore, do you use it?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:35:10
No help :/
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:07:53
oh gee, how is it going now?
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:21:17
don't attack the tools, attack the criminal.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:04:19
you're welcomed!
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:14:43
"you didn't lose your money. well you kinda lost your money" ---- uh what?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:51:47

@_date: 2018-02-07 08:24:58
Bye, Coinbase. Late..
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:19:38

@_date: 2018-03-01 08:07:37

@_date: 2018-03-07 07:53:54
a little bit duh!
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:19:37
while i don't enjoy it..
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:14:11
wow the banks is going through such a hard time now.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:33:39
true, im always against this idea since it was born.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:17:59
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:21:08
they have warning about this for ages already so....just your bad luck
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:49:23
0.001? sorry no...lol
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:23:10
do you think most of them are biased? then it's not right thing to do.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:58:51
oh please, im so done with forbes!
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:58:20
it's still too soon to say something about it.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:28:09
it all depends on IRS
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:45:06
i wonder what they do in this situation since it's such a mess.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:53:29
let them argue!
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:48:01
i love it, too.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:41:28
interesting enough.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:17:49
important everyone
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:47:35
He should have stated it in another better time.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:03:53
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:21:43
You shouldn't judge a clueless person who tried to give his best. *sigh*
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:58:17
It's starting slowly.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:14:23
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:49:22
Oneday it will come out as scam or not, only that we can tell hahaha im so tired of all the accusations.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:29:46
huh, can't be hahah
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:31:05
no lambos but there will be people need it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:20:46
does this support lightning too?
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:47:20
they do know what to do so no worries.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:31:22
well, temporarily, right?
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:11:00
though i support bitcoin in any way, likely half prefer cash/normal card payment.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:40:26
You mean coincidences? Yeah it happens all the times in this world, but it never ends up correctly as you expect. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:45:36
Heavy breathing everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:18:06
When you're so jealous of Africa even has more advanced tech for crypto, it's me.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:17:53
do they realize what they really want?
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:47:39
no, never tried these.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:57:47
ok, so i can't purchase it anw.
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:57:21
excuse me? this is the most ridiculous article i ever read lol, im not anyone's side but please be neutral and transparent.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:09:41
i will be waiting for the day "true digital gold" comes true, right now it's just theory
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:12:40
hahaha i used to think that they would, now it's for realll
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:36:23

@_date: 2018-03-06 09:54:41
it rocks!
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:22:12
it looks kinda weird.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:52:55
stable at $10k is nice.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:22:26
you shouldn't be giving financial advice while you're not sure with yourself, this is honest advice.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:47:57
one of my favorite site!
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:46:26
i bet they surely know but they just don't wanna accept it.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:18:59
bias much?

@_date: 2018-03-20 17:17:00
nopeeeee, no forks whatsoever. i prefer anything else but forks.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:27:53
i'd like to know the outcome though.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:15:40

@_date: 2018-03-14 15:18:29

@_date: 2018-03-07 07:13:04
definitely they're paying the debts of the past.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:30:49
i respect them more!

Did anyone see the typos....
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:41:04

@_date: 2018-02-01 17:36:03
Hahahaha are you safe for now?
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:58:04
of course, they're young generation so it's easy to explain their interest in new tech, and other things, too
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:01:30
Tabacco vs bitcoin, do they really come along??
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:49:30
such a cool vid!
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:09:08
Please fix it soon.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:38:23
gotta admit that bitpay cash is one and only bitpay
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:55:21
i will be still alive at that time so i will save this and show it again in 2020.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:38:03
ugh, there's my whole foods!
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:41:23
Nope :P
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:20:45
Obv he knows nothing of what he was talking about. So i will pass.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:17:34
It's ok, I can wait.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:26:33

@_date: 2018-02-14 10:06:14

Will take a look at it.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:22:43
me here, tooo
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:12:29
I think this feature is applied on everything due to high privacy? I mean if i enter wrong password on my phone, it gets locked too hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:54:40
I mostly hear it and then forget it immediately xD don't worry, seem like there're more doing same thing.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:03:18
good to watch this.
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:07:52
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:13:06

@_date: 2018-03-07 08:50:29
i love conspiracy, always make my day hahaha
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:19:07
if only we no longer need the banks, the world will be better at least.
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:56:09
Actually a nice idea!
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:19:42
Imagine how much it is in crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:57:16
Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:33:32
Hahaha sometimes bad luck can bring good things
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:16:49
i think we just need to reset it.?
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:10:07
metamask is good.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:28:30
i guess they stay neutral. taking sides is ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:46:38
hm i dont think it's a great idea indeed.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:15:16
awwww, wish i could join!
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:11:15
As if he ain't rich enough.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:04:30
He's just tired....asf
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:15:01

No surprise for me.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:20:20
Unless they wanna learn, otherwise your effort is useless.

Oh my, I've found many useful ways here.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:43:58
The best thing we can do now is to be positive. I know it's repeated but, what else.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:20:27
bisq is good but ui is not the same.
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:55:46

@_date: 2018-02-20 10:08:58
One right thing to do! 
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:05:06
That plot twist though.
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:39:21
The weather at its best, needless for cooling.

reading them is like reading history, just more interesting.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:17:19
I need solid proofs, or else everything is invalid ;)
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:36:57
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:13:55
Overall, Coinbase is going down lately. What's good
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:07:52
If i own that lambo, no biggie
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:09:41
I likely think that Russia owns lot of crypto mining already...
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:57:31
and said the company tried to block payment for crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:31:18
It costed a hella money.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:13:59
I think it's just June.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:14:44
At least they're sane in controlling the crypto world
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:20:56

Nice share. I upvoted for  you
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:21:42
I couldn't even laugh at this. Mediocre or even below it.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:07:41
why would people trust this so fast?? you can't earn that much that fast.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:12:54
Yes, they're testing Venmo!
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:07:26
it matters cuz it works out.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:02:00
so not impressive.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:59:10
YAS! Finallyyyy
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:06:18
20% cheaper is an awesome deal!
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:28:40
It'd be epic when they ask what's "hodl"? xD
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:26:44
Happy Lunar New Year.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:17:20

@_date: 2018-03-12 12:49:47
i don't think it's a great idea.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:15:54
How many times i need to see this kinda post? LOL
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:02:41
No, Coinbase sucks lately. but if you still wanna use then go on.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:32:59
sorry but are you being illegal now?
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:38:16
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:02:23
Talking to himself. Thanks
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:35:35
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:24:06

@_date: 2018-03-07 08:49:59
they hold more than that.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:20:49
what an excellent doc, i wish they could make more.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:12:44
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:31:53
The price is changing real quick!
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:01:58
This's been used when it was $7k lol
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:07:08
Read this several times and of course, impressive how it promises, one thing left is to be waiting for its performance.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:12:28
they go same pattern but it won't mean same result, right?
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:40:56
Seriously good.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:30:08
it's been a hard long road.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:49:37
Thanks for the notice.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:28:30
why don't you agree the disagreement that both are same!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:47:06
Oh thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:05:12
How many it will be till June? Just curious.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:21:45
more and more coming out but nothing is well improved within their big plan at all: coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:22:47
Thank to top comment, I didn't click it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:30:32
I've wondered for months buddy....Im so tired of this.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:56:38
That's how Trump does.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:46:16
Maybe I wanna buy it when the price is going down.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:05:05
Legit, but it could be totally all right.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:20:02
huge movement, don't u think?
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:16:51
i've been thinking same. it's time for a change.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:42:27
Bet there'll be people asking for lower fee cuz that-ain't-enough.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:16:14
ALWAYS Ledger Nano S!
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:24:48
I thought the title was saying "resting at $10k"...but it's still making sense.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:57:45
It's peaked lately thank to the crash.
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:54:27
Let's do it seriously, please.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:15:04
I'd like to have it fast and easy, rather than frustration like now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:38:54
Hope it will be over soon *chilling*
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:16:41
Cuz now everyone is tired with all the fees, long waiting for the transactions, etc. You think you'd need that?
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:44:52
duh, yes. they know anything else?
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:44:42
oooh thank you, i've been thinking about it for ages.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:58:17
Oh wow, Bitcoin &amp; Google!
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:26:37
Would u get it again?
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:19:19
every March right?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:50:03
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:01:02
Sorry, it depends on different perspective, if you don't see it as how others see it, it doesn't mean it's false/wrong/unacceptable. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:21:51
I upvoted.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:44:05
Not bad, I personally like it
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:13:05
Don't worry, they will buy again
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:56:20
it's time to move to germanyyy
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:43:27
hope so *sigh in a totally relieved manner*
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:53:13
hah, catch ya! other exchange flatforms should be investigated too.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:29:01
i wonder when? thanks
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:54:03
The source check is everything.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:57:10
anyone holding too?
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:14:33
i'll wait for the model 3. just thinking.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:58:27
so sorry...
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:30:18
This news shows up everywhere but nice, another insight.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:37:21
Buy it fast!
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:17:15
Pretty much late. But I think he knows what he is gonna do.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:44:01
YAY! Also, no legalization.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:38:56
why would they?
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:20:58
How? I get their points but at first place it is not illegal.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:16:46
Russia has tons of fascinating stories xD
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:45:56
what an obsession lol
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:10:45
i support this idea, im so sick of whenever i wanna search for real deal, no scammy news, they all show up immediately. this is solid! 
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:20:10
uhhhh is this so obvious? why? 
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:54:00
they really need dogecoin hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:20:36
Decently detailed vid. I like it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:42:56
It's no Goku hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:56:13
Your "so what" cringed me.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:06:41
i agree with what you said though which is realistic, not some kinda stuffs about extraordinary and over the expectation
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:48:38
Look at that lady behind hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:43:44
Send me there lol
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:38:59
not right time since people're sleeping in the rise of the price.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:33:20
I bet it's instant and flashing then.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:11:46
How many times do i need to read this...
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:31:56
Thanks! I love them!
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:10:00
Gotta upvote!
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:23:30
and robinhood, too!
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:26:54
the question is, can they make it?
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:07:34
well, the chance of using crypto as payments should be equal with cash and cc, too.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:21:33
oh never know that, thanks though
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:21:55
this should be having meaning, right?
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:30:12
don't mislead people to wrong articles please, don't make more wars lol
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:08:25
this is so much nonsense!
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:15:24
No sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:41:36
what a bull.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:57:38
Wow, i never expect this...
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:21:12
now it's working! YAYYYYY
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:38:09
yeah, good comparison, but bitcoin is likely a war.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:12:28
Not a Lambo but still count.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:21:06
The atmosphere of the room is chill. Likely having good time.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:14:52
i thought it would be a lot?
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:20:19
such a shady move of them!
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:24:09
My friends are buying more too. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:12:14
Prolly thinking about it now. haha
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:26:21
Im more concerned about the guy who received 10,000 BTC :O
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:08:00
no, likely how much u earn.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:38:13
Well, it's the consequence for being such a fraud.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:19:09
How could they be so rich while im struggling with one coin lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:54:09
Interesting read!
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:25:30
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:33:59
Bitcoin is going up!
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:16:23
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:48:27
Agree that there's no laws needed but people should behave.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:18:36
not really in my perspective.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:07:56
Still, it's my money. Not credit.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:36:00
Also the lightning network demon (LND) is in really good shape.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:42:49
Can't go wrong with that pair up.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:24:31
Ok i get their points, but just stop.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:29:52
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:24:48
What a plain Jane.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:22:54
i think the banks is afraid or scared of everything lol, new phobia everyday
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:02:50
Sure it's been a tough time for newb, while the OG are selling in panic.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:33:04
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:56:40
I love it, rather than those that trying to ban crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:10:53
I bet we all make mistakes in life, how we recover from it is way more important.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:15:34

@_date: 2018-02-27 06:34:45
Hahahaha poor them. But it's only suspected though??
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:39:16
Oh so that one? Oh sh*t. I did support her.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:39:19

@_date: 2018-02-14 08:23:48
Ok stop there.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:32:13

@_date: 2018-02-27 06:13:11
And yes it's an expensive restaurant in Venezuela, based on all the problems here, there are restaurants that are still offering good quality service and dishes but for an expensive price compared to monthly salary. ----- no thanks, so u must be really rich to have that dinner?
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:11:16
Saying is easier than being done, besides the bank is allowed to issue any rule and regulation they wanted.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:02:43
They do have full potentials but to solve it needs more than that. c'mon!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:58:25
As far as i know binance ain't from china.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:16:50
It could happen, but i think it's in the far future.
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:00:02
You're welcome!
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:27:02
mostly people though it's a scam so they've reported it xD
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:09:29
that's quite a good stat you collect.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:37:13
if you don't buy, you're a fool
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:41:53
We're running out of BTC soon is what i can see.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:35:21
I wonder why it's only now.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:03:51
Actually it looks good, cuz i love vintage things.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:25:06
Of course, he can't be Satoshi, what kinda fuss we're making about here?
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:03:05
No, what were you thinking?
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:31:28
I feel you brah
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:03:18
I'd choose pizza. No second guessing
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:21:01
How to prevent this?
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:17:43
oh wow, didn't expect that at all!
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:31:08
hahahahahaha how those hackers feel i wonder.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:21:10
so sorry for them
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:27:53
i can't believe people still purchase wallet on eBay!
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:26:10
Can you really trust them though? I'm being doubtful alot, you can't trust much.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:06:07
Yes! Thanks
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:30:39
Ok, grab popcorn and wait for it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:22:43
Am I the only one who feels this is a little bit...narrow?
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:20:46
How many times do i need to see this news over again?
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:03:48
Maybe i will be moving there, who knows.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:17:18
This kid is going places.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:35:34
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:07:46

@_date: 2018-03-01 09:35:05

@_date: 2018-02-05 15:54:34
Lightning has been a solution for weeks.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:17:57
likely no....
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:41:13
it looks good, clean and neat.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:34:54
Do your taxes right.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:39:16
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:05:18
If he treats it as a race, he'll never reach there.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:28:44
thanks, we knew.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:43:15
I didn't know that exists.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:32:48
More than OK I suggest
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:58:39
Yeah ok, but i don't know how could they determine who owns crypto hello?
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:41:25
hahahaha epic!
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:01:23
Zero linked transaction is everything you need.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:40:06
Who's the marketing behind this hahaha brilliant!
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:50:56
It's one's mindset when spending money :/
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:07:59
there will loads of advanced inventions then so, yeah i will choose right at that time.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:25:42
Stock is not currency either...
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:17:59

@_date: 2018-02-14 08:17:24
Huge news!
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:35:32
We need this kinda reports for this difficult time.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:43:09
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:16:27
who cares where bitcoin is stored legally...
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:58:33
Couldn't get better than this!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:56:11
Lower your theory and we will talk hehe
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:52:35

@_date: 2018-02-14 07:49:02
I love Japan! Anything from Japan.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:09:22
He did take time to learn about it which is nice.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:47:53
so no autocorrect for good!
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:09:08
none is better than the other 
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:17:44
mining other cryptos would be better lol
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:25:44
how will it work?
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:57:08
i expect other big airlines will do the same.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:56:05
on these articles like this, i wish i was rich.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:58:11
oh gee, how bad!!!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:34:14
No, Ledger and Trezor are wallets, not Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:52:07
I wish I had his life hahahaha
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:49:15
i think it's bitinstant.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:16:54
these kinda posts are getting old with all the dumping trolls
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:47:46
"Holding" in our "holding" or "issuing"? I wonder.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:51:39
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:40:31
Solid advice and tips, but also a shilling.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:29:33
You're just upset with the loss of $15k????
Hope you will get it fixed soon!
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:52:22
No, cuz at the first place, it ain't your money. Stop crying.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:03:13
useronboard teardowns are excellent!
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:37:02
And now new rules pop out.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:52:52
And then get taxed for selling crypto. lol
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:00:29
This one proves why to be a scammer also needs to be intelligent.
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:27:48
there should be no email requirement, be careful next time :D
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:09:39
No surprise
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:13:32
I wish many would open about it too.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:38:01
what a whooping amount of money....
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:31:08
I think they will do everything to shield their activities over bitcoin, who knows what's going on there?
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:10:11
I've been carefully reading it, it's more serious than it seems.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:15:44
Stocks are irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:58:47
Maybe this is just coincidence, anything can happen. And I believe he's still alive, only 11 years going by.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:58:06
They did it!
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:05:19
Im more of a bear, not sloth - it's doing nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:47:19
What they meant by "skills"? LOL
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:46:28
Buy, right?
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:23:26
what would the miners do?
they know what they should do.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:52:03
but you're still alive which is enormously lucky.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:17:30
well well well like what i expected.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:28:25
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:29:40
Congrats mate.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:50:39
To the moon!
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:09:28
Well, I rarely consider it's down by prices, it's just people are trying to sell as much as possible.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:32:30
Nope? They did?
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:30:44
AI is real then Satoshi is real too.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:52:03
Can you imagine how ironic this is hahaha
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:08:11
congrats dude.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:26:54
Call it whatever you want.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:50:12
LOL, I have no idea about this, cuz it looks fine, not close to trash.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:46:44
And lose all or win all.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:09:00
people seem to love competing to be who is the stupidest!?
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:38:30
but i still love gemini
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:09:26
WHY??? It's sooooo nonsense.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:59:15
But it doesn't seem to be well known for crypto. I doubt about it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:40:50
And many memes for other prices...
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:20:41
The devil work hard but the hypocrite work harder lol
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:58:57
The media plays a big role for all this confusion &amp; frustration
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:04:54
I love how overreacting this is hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:51:09
Mainstream adoption baby!
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:34:37
Good app! Well done
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:56:47
Highly agree.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:01:29
I wonder how is he feeling now.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:27:45
hope it won't be ig-schnorred.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:40:22
Rola is so pretty!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:59:37
"they need to sell first"? lololo
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:33:09
How could? I mean they're very strict on everything, they don't even allow Youtube, hello i have a friend there and she told me so
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:16:22
everything is bubble, even our life.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:47:39
ahhhh what a shame!
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:54:40
you're right, but there're people still here cuz of the tech, which i find it adorable (?), not cuz of the price goes up and down and crash.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:44:08
Will it survive thru zombie apocalypse?
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:31:04
Is there anything more awesome than this?
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:29:16
Good on them for figuring things out that fast. I mean really fast
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:15:17
Awesome than I expected.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:18:41
Go Austin!
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:41:41
Samourai's alr on top, this will take them to another new top.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:59:45
Where can i watch full clip?
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:29:15
Oh gosh!
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:27:51
Hahahaha, but it's not even a good sign to be positive.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:46:42
I'll be more pleased if this comes true lol. But theory is theory, beside he didn't explain what led to it clearly
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:01:16
Long post but worth reading.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:13:51
Im not even a millionaire yet and people out there are multitrillion................
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:07:07
Well, it's called "investment".
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:21:49
That kis is going to places.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:08:41
i love reading his works, really inspiring.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:50:39
hope he will make something right.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:15:35
as much as i like him, there's something still misleading about this whole video.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:14:49
I'd get that haha
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:13:05
Just report it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:08:51
Done it
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:00:30
a little positive vibe. i love it
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:45:17
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:41:55
India has alw been known as no.1 of supporting crypto overall. No surprise, go India!
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:08:11
good invest, he knows what he's doing or not even since he's rich enough to own a condo, what else he can't?
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:07:51
where can i sign up?
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:40:04
all the accusations can't break the record of people investing in BTC 
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:53:04
Those drops are super sharp. It can cut me!
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:39:37
Binance for sure.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:06:38
Nope...hell no
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:58:00
thought they have no business with crypto
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:30:03
Sad news...
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:37:27
So fun to read this, will they make more?
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:35:21
it can't be,check it again.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:01:55
Hah, Coinbase, no surprise.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:50:11
But the government's going to twist it!
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:09:08
Only back when it's high??
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:19:50
good for the crash, im gonna have spree on it!
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:17:28
i don't get why some people are still on his side, if using whatever not your things to make benefit for yourself, it's not ok, in this case, absolutely illegal, what are you crying for?
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:26:15
It's been 6th of Feb alr...
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:47:36
Thank to the dip
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:20:56
sorry for your loss though! 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:25:48
I wish i know it too, yet he/she doesn't seem to show up. So we will never never never ever know!
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:13:49
hahahaha what did you take?
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:12:33
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:37:25
How many please?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:15:11
This means war?
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:06:50
it's sad to see how the world turns out.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:36:13
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:36:37
Nice as hell.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:12:35
Not bad, but I think it's only South Africa.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:00:25
Or more precisely, software issues, right?
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:35:57
Bcash hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:48:41
Keep going buddy
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:08:22
Two more years is too long, as I guess there will be more many things happen in that 2 years straight which prevents crypto overall to hit the high street, but let's hope.
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:00:54
The title is confusing me for real. Anw, good for what he's done!
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:35:14
Thank you! Newbs need it
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:14:32
looking soooo good man!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:52:58
I think i just care more about the tech that they could bring to the table.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:01:25
Hahahaha right in time.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:25:23
I love both for now.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:03:53
Say whatever you want.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:14:29
so we're in the bull trap now.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:30:42
I seldom think they would do that, at least they put efforts.!
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:16:56
Poor thing haha
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:45:57
This world we are craving for.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:51:27
I think, just hold, let's see how it will turn out
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:22:02
i can say that, too.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:41:42
But it's all in bitcoin..........
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:09:17
that makes me feel nauseous...
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:54:28
yup, it's also what i think, crypto should be well used in gaming.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:36:55
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:17:12
no, the article didn't show it lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:49:37
Thanks, def check it out.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:27:54
"While some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity (e.g. blocksize increases), this approach generally degrades the decentralized state of the network and cannot reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale. To overcome these technical barriers, we are collaborating on decentralized Layer 2 protocols that run atop these public blockchains to achieve global scale, while preserving the attributes of a world class DID system." --- this is more important.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:35:30
OK I trust it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:35:50
Hahahaha I told so in the previous topic by another user, it even bans Youtube, what chance for crypto??
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:47:03
Or the CRAS....
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:48:32
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:30:59
Please please do ittt
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:21:10
Anything hahaha you can't tell. Keep guessing.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:50:06
Thanks, but it's quite a perf time to get Bitcoin. Irony I know but it is the time.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:22:08
To be private is good.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:21:10
easy to understand right? but some refuse to learn it
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:41:16
your comparison is not bad, but you hurt yourself. and watching a rocket rising is much easier.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:44:17
Is that stereotype? Stop it
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:36:21
NO, they're different. gee
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:42:33
Anywhere to purchase the audiobook?
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:18:17
you should add more adverbs like surprisingly, accordingly, etc. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:28:51
Likely no or yes. You can't assume that quick.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:14:13
Yeah, better off that way.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:10:13
YAY, so it's mainnet now!
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:24:03
Don't let me down :(
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:54:59
Don't! Keep your mind in peace :(
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:10:25
Nothing is that easy man.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:30:44
What you've stated is not 100% confirmed.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:02:04
it doesn't, but it needs to fix a whole lots of things.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:37:36
One of the most unexpected things is we never know what will happen in that 7 years LOL hugeee risk!
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:12:25
Shut up JPMorgan
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:36:42
They should face it in order to know the market is getting better.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:09:32
It's been around for a while now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:59:15
It's supposed to be that way.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:19:06
Why not? Im confused 
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:43:42
Should i trust a communist country, sorry but it's real.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:34:21
Centralization or not, it's one thing I can't neglect.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:14:26
We use crypto to avoid banks, now we are about to have another type of banks
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:36:08
and not all of them want to invest in btc.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:38:04
Smart move, Wiki!
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:51:06
no, why do you want so many features lol.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:14:19
Germany for all the win.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:15:43
as if it's real.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:11:24
it absolutely wipes boohoo coins away.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:47:44
how does it should work?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:42:45
Never gets old xD
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:20:23
im no surprised when they over consume cc usage.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:25:27
It's weak.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:37:26
I see nothing odd, it's like another benefit we're all gon get.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:24:05
So get the dip?
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:08:29
Make some more!
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:26:38
Nice graphic!
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:17:48
Been playing with it, it's nice.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:27:59
well, i don't have trust a person who leads an empire of producing fake stuffs, people can praise whatever they want about him but if he's really smart, let's start doing something authentic, not fake stuffs.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:22:04
This is no good buddy.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:32:18
He's so smart, I'm not even half.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:30:46
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:38:25
Say everyone, being positive is good but it doesn't mean it will go up to the moon after this crash. i know im saying obvious but yeah, anything can happen anytime.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:58:06
Big news!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:55:10
What do u expect at a troll?
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:18:02
Reuters's sources are like, making a mess.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:40:59
These designs are lit!
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:12:07
I don't think John McAfee is one of the smartest.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:35:25
"it could be said that Bitcoin is another thing that only benefits the wealthy and developed world." oh you don't say...
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:18:53
How they can tell?
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:03:35
Well at this point i realize we all can give different opinions about Bitcoin and crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:09:11
No joke.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:48:10
Save up everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:09:39
Hands down cuz LN is legitimately the best invention ever.
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:58:44
true, it's my plan as well, but most of people just freak out.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:29:09
as if we all can predict anything...
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:46:56
avoid them!
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:47:31
Let's them do the mining!!! Besides the stores make huge profits :P
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:39:43
Gee, can he afford that much?
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:41:48
hahahahahahahaha accurate.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:30:18
cuz it's $10k baby1
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:02:28
Yeah i heard about it for 1 month, which is cool, but what to use with that course?
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:14:03
We must make a movie about this event, I've alr imagined.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:30:21
Love it, I esp love all zombie thingy.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:49:38
Amateur or not I don't pay too much attention, but you really got a good point of what you wanna do, so good luck, would love to see the final result.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:06:57
hah, who he's lying to, everyone knows xD
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:52:46
The tittle is childish lol.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:25:17
That's one interesting story though. Love to see people's reactions.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:20:30
It's so real hahahahaha
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:52:43
Shapeshift has done well.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:34:16
Anywhere that you like, I usually research started with a little typing on google and whoop!
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:16:09
Oh interesting, so much ideal for this time coming.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:05:44
The reduce of volatility is all i needdd
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:42:30
Same thing everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:44:39
Let's reach 10!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:28:09
There's a tough competition out there already, I don't think they wanna risk it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:18:20
Agree wit you.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:11:36
From itself? Wow, good move.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:00:38
Waiting for your result lol
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:31:36
but but but....people can share their opinions XD
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:36:05
ohhh i see how those are working now.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:36:46
Make it on paper is easier and practical.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:21:18
I can't even imagine the day it reaches $1,2mil gee.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:08:10
Giggling at the kids.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:15:45
Why is he still pulling such jokes??
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:53:46
$1 is too much!
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:19:38
While other banks are putting lots of effort to ban it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:02:43
this was written to stirred up confusions right?
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:34:44
The green is more likely Bcash lol
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:29:53
"Kids". How cute!
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:47:09
This guy is still relevant?
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:29:37
I don't get it either.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:15:44
Cool as hell!
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:46:42
that figure says everything.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:34:53
Only $100k?
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:26:12
He loved talking the rollercoaster lol
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:07:58
It's easy cheesy for them though.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:04:46
There must be billions to your answer, surprise? I can't even count.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:15:06
Hopefully they really mean it, not just grabbing attention.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:23:35
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:55:23
So cute :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:00:14
Still in the draft?
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:21:52
hahaha bring more !
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:47:10
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:23:32
Sorry but no Segwit?
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:10:24
Have fun pumping!
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:31:42
Well that's what they must do in order to stay relevant.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:32:43
Nice share buddy
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:22:21
you don't need this, tbh
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:51:17
No, it ain't real.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:00:49
Reading all of this now seems useless somehow.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:09:36
Welcome as alw
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:38:43
Same thing, isn't it? Why so strict lol
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:40:49
i thought u just need to make a deposit and voila!
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:34:41
the fastest way is slow catches my heart for real T_T.
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:29:42
My friends tried it and fell in love immediatelyyy
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:30:07
Remember when it's below $9k, was it a steal also??
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:50:12
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:20:05
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:52:34
first time i ever heard about this web
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:10:18
Don't worry, they switch and turn every darn time.
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:55:17
Please make more.!
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:32:18
Im not surprised since other banks doing the same.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:37:51
sorry but what is that and what is it for?
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:43:31
I know that feeling.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:20:35
Coinbase is always like that. Meh, you need to wait mate.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:06:40
Or just downvote, needless to make a fuss.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:25:40
Nice share.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:28:36
Love that whale
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:08:33
They should get a brand for their group: Scammiez
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:37:29
But it'll be in far far future.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:43:04
There we go.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:55:53
You don't say....
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:30:27
Keep calm and keep going.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:20:14
I thought it's been going for a while??
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:02:00
Can we not make a fuss about BTC and BCH here...
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:08:04
Love it. Genius though.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:57:09
Buy whatever you can, hold anything you want, and sell something you can.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:08:18
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:24:47
Wrong sub buddy.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:39:21
Thanks God you found the answer.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:40:14
Mate, this news is old.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:33:23
1000 next week.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:01:23
I hope all the scams will be over, or stopped, but I don't think it will happen since yeah, there are still many people out there trying to rob us!
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:12:08
Ohhahahaha these replies though. It's uhmuzing hahahaha
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:16:09
Who knows inside they're shaking.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:48:31
True, people can't detect much between both, so end up buying bcash instead. what a fraud he is
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:05:47
My condolence to his family. RIP
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:29:40
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:51:26
I understand that they're trying to make it easier for crypto but I don't think it's good idea. Seem tacky!
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:59:52
Nice to know that you've got it!
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:35:04
"maybe"? no it is.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:28:05
The previous crash told lots about the people around and on this sub
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:00:47
People are clueless is my fav part hahaha
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:47:32
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:54:01
i thought it's located in iceland? so no?
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:56:00
I tell you, everyone XD
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:32:20
Any sign of him now?
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:36:11
True, DON'T
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:33:00
The atmosphere was weird, or just me?
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:03:22
wow, how it's that much much less??
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:17:06
Who knows, value is different now and then.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:53:24
This seems to be normal to everyone lives with bitcoin for such a long time.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:46:45
Anws, it's such a good project!
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:07:17
Craigslist is the pioneer. Look how others r following their step
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:01:49
i don't think so, not all the crash is caused by them.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:45:37
Ok who did this? how could this fit everything happened hahaha
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:18:00
here, sun rises at the east.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:39:20
It does! They were in panic sell I guess during the crash, and since the price is up again, they won't risk buying it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:14:22
OMG, this is amazing! Love to see more illustrations!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:50:28
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:11:20
yet they're never openly admitting it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:31:35
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:15:56
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:55:30
Nope, you thought wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:18:59
If we're all nice, needless to be afraid and live in a scary-free world.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:39:56
Seriously good! Keep it uppp
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:35:03
at least they're financial experts and they could tell you if you should or not, regardless the bitcoin issue.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:21:29
no it doesn't?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:03:53
Crashing is normal, we get used to it.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:40:59
It quite is now. mate
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:41:08
I kinda guesses it right too
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:04:15
Let's wait for the final judgement, this looks far than I think but who knows.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:40:44
It's happening..
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:34:36
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:09:58
Gotta save that shit.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:06:14
What he was giving were outstanding, hopefully people can learn a lot from this, even me.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:15:09
No, no really.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:20:44
neither of these is all good for me,stop that
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:08:46
Real deal holders won't even care it drops to $6k then hurriedly sell all.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:38:47
It shooks me.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:08:52
Why Goldman is here? WHY?
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:25:10
Definitely do.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:34:11
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:56:28
Who really did this?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:50:06
How can it be "better"?
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:58:54
Well, sooner than it's planned to debut.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:46:22
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:02:42
i wonder same issue, though i don't travel much but it's still useful to know.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:09:57
You can try Square cash, it's good.
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:10:45
Don't worry
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:13:32
Or any crypto?
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:29:06
wow! when did they even come up with this?
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:03:03
was he being serious? lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:07:26
OMG did u see it, I adore this guy.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:30:38
with all the assumptions and confusions, i hope this is false hahah
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:12:05
so it kinda means our funds are at risk?
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:51:55
let them lol, why are you concerned if they hold or not?
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:40:39
It's not a big issue, as they stated.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:58:30
Really nice of them
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:19:10
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:28:29
Internet is essential or else nothing happens and yes you still need it to open
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:35:35
It ain't a surprise :D
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:29:18
Buttttt it's right tho??? ISIS purchase weapons by crypto!
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:40:49
truest comparison ever! thumbs up!
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:19:43
That's just the beginning.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:48:07
The question is will it really work since many banks are banning crypto purchase by CC?
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:31:47

@_date: 2018-03-16 11:46:37
please tell him to stop.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:47:28
Gee, people do whatever they feel right.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:43:46
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:31:08
Would be perf if it's $15k, right? RIGHT?
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:29:29
It looks lit, keep going buddy.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:41:27
What REKT means sorry? I'm late at some points.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:18:39
then don't, cuz it wasn't made to be regulated, except money laundering and trading for weapons from ISIS.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:12:44
It's quite fascinating to read this haha
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:28:35
What a jump!
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:14:09
finally the bugs are fixed!
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:06:27
How lucky you are to have bi weekly salary :O
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:54:06
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:47:41
Not excited.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:49:08
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:52:01
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:40:47
but i also feel that bcash is not that bad, but why no one like them, cuz it's a fork of btc or?
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:07:24
I can do better.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:08:35
Or bull trap. You can't really tell.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:40:34
The vid is nicely done!
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:59:45
According to me, yes. Why not?
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:23:23
If i was him, i'd deny it, too. It's not safe to show your financial status to everyone out there is first rule.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:14:12
Growing strong together fellas!
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:27:08
Oh shady shady
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:08:05
The question is will it big or not?
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:33:29
Coinbase is doing its left energy to win customers back.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:57:45
they're cute, the others don't matter.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:42:57
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:43:21
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:50:59
$8k already?? That's fast.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:28:21
Yeah true, do that two!
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:54:19
Im not sure what r those numbers under the chart though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:03:29
No coin for you, troll
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:18:51
But but but it's not even their right at the first place to regulate and approve crypto?
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:48:53
no more selling!
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:15:26
cool analysis!
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:37:01
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:14:00
that's heartbreaking at some points, people.
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:30:07
Oh now you know that. Anw, thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:56:33
why they do so dirty lol
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:29:10
Debit cards ban triggers me lol, it's really our money!!
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:46:58
I feel like they make it as if they're all supportive towards crypto users but, it's likely doubled taxed,....
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:56:37
Unless it's used Ledger purchased from eBay. Of course I ain't saying it's all safe, but the rish is likely 10%
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:26:17
now that i call two-faced!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:40:22
So, it's not official yet?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:58:50
Oh thanks, found them~
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:52:00
Why Bcash is here...
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:49:12
er.. okkk
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:55:05
Definitely do!
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:32:31
Nice share, it makes my day.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:26:41
Neat and smooth.!
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:59:25
one good looking site and easy to use.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:51:57
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:08:06
He's sold one lol. easyyy
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:13:42
I support Germany for warmly welcome Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:11:17
It's about evaluating which one is better.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:10:59
how nice, and def samourai is one of the good wallets out there that fulfills our needs.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:23:30
That was a sweet time. Where people were panic.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:06:29
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:47:55
Sorry to say but im here for good memes.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:42:28
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:30:51
I guess it'll be in august.
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:05:35
I like that site. it works so well
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:33:40
Well, they admitted they were at fault, so we should give them second chance, don't be so petty.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:24:25
Yes preach!
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:03:02
I love her shows, and now I love her even more. At least she's very transparent about what she was doing.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:30:57
then i should lower double of 40x
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:31:16
Never get old haha
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:21:50
It gave me headache for real.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:03:08
the fee is quite high, right? 2%!
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:34:04
it's overpaid.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:14:05
oh there a full doc.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:13:33
Oh, thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:47:08
Wait, where is Trump?
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:12:30
Gee, i get that point but people can stop act superior lol?
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:16:34
Why would they? They've all supported and backed by the whole national teams.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:37:56
Nope, they should stay where they r.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:31:08
you can tot search it, no big deal
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:42:38
This triggers me though.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:33:48
I'd go for their choice.
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:15:13
LOL exactly my thought hahaha, esp China's on and off ban on crypto. See? Nobody cares.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:56:07
ugh, randomcoin ?
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:53:34
there are two kinds of people in this world: the happy and the sad.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:17:20
wow! can they not slow down?
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:28:13
Be cautious with hashing power.
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:27:05
What a waste of money LOL
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:46:21
Im in, too.
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:33:40
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:41:21
do we need it, actually?
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:10:38
Twitter is now full with scammers, but i won't buy it, but wonder why there are still people believing them....
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:14:55
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:29:23
If it's successful, it's going to cause a huge storm!
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:22:27
we're all broke xD
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:56:53
how was the gambling? xD
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:42:29
any way to support such payment?
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:48:39
isn't it in 2014?
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:39:20
total mess. but wait, it's only early april, right?
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:01:23
totally relevant hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:36:13
I get it quite though, not sure what the guy below crying about....
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:14:37
we all have that, right?
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:50:40
WE WISH!
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:34:42
this possibly fraud is not yet proven lol, but enjoy the memes
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:10:39
not really, merely it is. what people are thinking!
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:39:07
i wonder, what ants have anything to do with bitcoin? or decoration?
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:48:53
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:29:50
looks cute
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:29:00
if we knew, no one would be this miserable lol
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:39:00
im not sure if the kids take and get it.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:02:18
sure it's goin to work well, they are not that clueless.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:59:30
overall, i still think credit cards work in most cases
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:42:10
will it be legit as i still try to get what it's all about T_T
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:46:45
looking good! nope, best!!
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:21:54
let's see how it will turns out
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:40:26
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:49:15
lambo lol
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:51:17
i would die to know "when"?
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:05:20
has it risen?
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:16:12
kudos to this.
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:39:52
i do appreciate what he spends time on for the research himself which is fine, i love reading these anw.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:01:57
Oh gosh, ETH, and DASH
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:48:05
so, your point?
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:48:52
panic much lol
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:31:47
Can confirm all males.
Got to say I am super surprised there is not more adaption of bitcoin in Africa. The fluctuation of currency over there makes bitcoin look like a joke. Not to mention that phone money is already in common use.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:37:17
coinance? new one?
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:21:44
oh now you say it!
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:51:55
YAS! I love it, been reading over and over again.
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:38:09
so i guess this's another day for another drama
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:30:49
tell them all!
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:05:47
imma read more about that guy
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:19:55
it's quite a decently sad news, i dont know why we're being joyful
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:40:10
yeah, tell me about it when im being broke as hell
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:05:08
did you check it again?
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:05:00
wait whatttt?????
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:27:57
all the theories and controversies are so interesting.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:41:51
it depends on perspective though
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:41:32
make it happen is their motto lol
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:49:38
yeah, solid fact since day 1
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:06:43
hahahaha love how "nerd" he is.
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:56:39
for real? all? and everyone?
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:49:52
hahahahahaha best laugh everrr
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:59:36
that actually looks good.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:05:59
i hold all the times.
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:22:04
ain't lambo, bro.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:01:52
i need more than just that
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:38:29
thank you heaps!
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:58:28
thanks for the warning dude.
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:40:53
hell yes, i need this.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:47:37
how i hate number 6
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:39:10
im a bit off for the idea, not that groundbreaking, not that lame either. but a yes maybe.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:52:18
remember when bitcoin was nearly $2.95, too?
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:22:05
so how's it going?
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:38:21
good luck at all cost with your generosity.
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:59:18
do u really think bad bitcoin will give away good out come? hmmmm
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:01:11
aside from the current situation of bitcoin, which im trying to ignore it lol, that photo is awesome.
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:41:39
do we really need more hold?
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:41:05
hahahahaha, side note i love that movie
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:04:12
yup, needless to have killer app.
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:38:01
still a good outfit for later party haha
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:28:17
one good old time
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:31:01
neat vid!
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:02:36
ha! you think they know everything!? xD
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:16:36
somehow he's not totally wrong
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:50:23
the title says it well.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:29:29
i hate how people joked about bitcoin on april's fool day lol
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:14:22
the title is quite meh.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:14:58
i know that lol,should we all move there?
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:37:50
pour water on that burnnn
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:16:49
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:51:55
how could gdp applied to crypto?
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:51:33
is it too late, now?
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:39:26
oops, thanks for the notice.
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:32:33
so now i don't know which side to buy anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:13:18
I'd love to see how people praise their voices about bitcoin in general and cryptocurrency overall, but to assume quickly is just meh to me.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:38:35
Take it slow but it's not typical.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:50:43
I can even tell it lol upgrade your game Coinbase!
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:59:52
actually it looks beautiful regardless the fact that it also lags my laptop hahahha
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:03:23
Me want ETF's... And cookies
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:06:19
there's always a start and an end.
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:40:46
but the headphone/earphone never changeeee
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:34:08
you had it coming lol 
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:41:10
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:59:56
BITCOIN RUSH EVERYONE!
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:01:30
no segwit, no opinion lol
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:04:34
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:21:09
how fast and shiny!
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:21:28
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:57:07
also, COINBASE!
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:49:26
yup, esp this time of the year so it's unavoidable.
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:38:24
overall, it's their own choices which i have no rant for it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:07:47
eh so no more bitcoin payment, ever?
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:41:18
you're sooo lucky!
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:36:45
everyone should call this guy out so he knows who he's been dealing with.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:47:19
u can privately contact them
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:44:32
Hi all. IDK if this is the best place to post. Just want to let people know that we are here and we are working to make a better world for all!
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:25:35
Doing a meetup in denver. Going to have a local restruant/bar  host it and accept bitcoins for a couple hours. Looking for more local businesses and people intrested. First event begining of next month.
@_date: 2013-10-18 08:42:05
It would be hard for me to just hold on to 600,000+ BTC as the price makes a 2000% price increase. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:57:11
Like a non writning producer for movies and TV.
@_date: 2013-10-18 08:29:40
I wish this was less true.
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:04:50
It seems blockchain.info has implimented it. 
Has anyone tried it?
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:48:09
Used there customer service before. Little slow but they got to me.
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:23:36
who's watching who?
@_date: 2013-11-01 08:14:02
I would point out that obamacare had a lot of public attention and multiple parties all trying to manipulate it in different ways. When it comes trying "to corner the global market" there might not be so many people that it has to get "approved" by, and certainly not by the public. 
@_date: 2013-10-13 21:04:51
You dont have a camera. Or dont want to use it becasue your paranoid.
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:05:44
To those who say he is paranoid couldn't coinbase or some other party be tracking his spending? If that is not happening now it will be very soon.
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:12:26
I thought about zerocoin but that adds way more work for the miners then mixers do.
@_date: 2013-10-25 12:53:54
everyone switch crypto's quick.
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:48:21
Had some problems and used there live support just now. Super fast and even changed to english.
@_date: 2013-10-13 23:46:23
To bad it will be well over that in a couple months. One company alone is shipping out 2ph in December.
@_date: 2013-10-06 10:06:02
Yes but who agrees to buy minimum 4k worth of equipment especially when there is no math to show you will get any real return?
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:56:29
What about a small fund to get a couple cheap cameras in the hands of some of these locals.
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:34:46
OK so this will allow for making payroll simpler, and not have to use mixing. Any progress update on this? Seems like there has not been anything new since spring?
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:30:22
Upgraded to "might be bigger then a fad"
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:50:06
This also saves you from wallet specific searches, or virus. If you do encrypt you wallet that helps, but it is better for them to never try to crack it. Nothing is uncrackable, it is all about how much "money" you have to put into cracking it.
@_date: 2013-10-25 04:44:29
Bitcoinwisdom accounts for a couple more things 
@_date: 2013-11-01 07:26:43
It is weird that there are a bunch of no fee Chinese exchanges.
@_date: 2013-10-13 04:41:29
Right. Ok just making sure I was not missing somthing stupid. Wouldnt want my wife to find out about my gambling. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:35:45
Faked a little?

But the pay check scenario where I am an employer who pays in Bitcoin. Am I going to send him a new address for every paycheck? How complex would that be on a large scale?

Lots of countries and business want something other than USD centric economy.

Well not so much about being anyonymous as not having all my banking public.

Max you can get removed if you give them a good reason. I did a trade no problem. Waiting for some btc to be removed but there is already 1 confirmation so looks good.
You dont need bank info. Just normal stuff name, phone number, email. I had to do 2 factor athentication to withdrawal though.

Not for any type of cold storage. If this is a semi long term backup use something like truecrypt to add another layer. One of the biggest heists in the near future might be an inside job at one of these clouds services. You dont want to be one of the people that didnt take the extra 5 min to save your wallet file from an easy attack.

Can be, that is not what I mean. I believe there are people easily manipulating the price up, because there are no fees. Almost a quarter of the market is being traded with 0 fees! .5% on each trade adds up for day traders. BTCchina has a 24hr volume of 12,000btc at 5% that is about 600btc a day that stays in the market.
