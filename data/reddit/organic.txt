Nothing at all, but coordination and centralization areas two of a pair.  The later fills in when the former proves insufficient.

Right, but we're talking about more coordination between nodes, no?

Bubbles come from asset appreciation, not real investment.

The Minksy financial instability hypothesis outlines the differences between stable and unstable investment.  He outlines a type of investment that is not driven by speculation, but by returns from productive use of assets; i.e. buying a factory and making money producing widgets instead of making money selling the factory 3 months later for a profit.

Right, [he defines speculative finance](  Other definitions are irrelevant to the hypothesis itself; i.e. if you change the definition, you are attacking something other than what he wrote.
