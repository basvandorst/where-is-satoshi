Did it affect your credit score? My score dropped by 140 points once because a doctor mailed his bill to the wrong address. I called the collection agency and paid it and explained the problem, and they took it off my record.

I highly doubt somebody's going to jump to tax evasion just because a co-worker has more shit. That would be completely ridiculous. Maybe he's just better with his money, doesn't blow it on drugs, doesn't buy as high quality food, is better at shopping, received an inheritance at some point, etc etc. Maybe he just makes more money than you and you didn't know. It could be any number of things, you'd have to be insane to just conclude that because your co-worker nicer stuff he must be cheating on his taxes.
When I was making $12 an hour as a plumbers helper I bought a 3-bed 2-bath house on a 15-year, a $2200 iMac, a $1300 PC, a 55" LED, a surround system, an iPad, etc, and still saved up a few more grand. When my co-workers ask me how I can afford all that shit, well, how many cigarettes do you smoke a week? About two packs? What is that, $50 a month? Quit smoking and next year you'll have an iPad. How much do you spend on weed every month? $600? Holy shit, a couple months and you can get yourself a fancy new TV. But nope, I'm just cheating on my taxes that's what it is.

Technically, everything is made from everything.
I don't know if that actually sciences out but it sounds cool.
