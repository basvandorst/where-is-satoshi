I got true friends like that, a whole two of them. I'd still have to interact with the bigger group though, and thats where the problem lies. One of my relatives has his own advertising agency and makes bank, he drives a 10 yr old toyota and lives in a pretty small condo, so you'd never suspect that he's pretty wealthy. Although of course you're right, most local business owners are not trying to hide their identity.

Of course they're slowly getting out - they have to. Most early adopters were technical guys (think /g/), and bought stuff with btc that can be considered liabilities (financially speaking) - cars, houses, etc... If money isn't coming from anywhere else, and they haven't had the foresight to invest it in filthy fiat investments they need to cash out more and more to support their new lifestyles. But at the same time - there is nothing wrong with it, btc will be spread out between more people, and eventually the price will recover.

who downvoted this? US government is not cryptocurrency friendly, thats just a fact. Canadian exchanges pulled out of US a while ago now.

Completely idiocy on the part of another inflated exchange. What's next - a DNA sample?

I do not use bitstamp but what happened to you is confiscation, plain and simple. If they allowed you to deposit your money/btc without verification, then withdrawing that money should not be blocked in anyway. My guess is that they have some "accounting and regulatory issues".... so its going the way of Mt. Goy.

Occasional movement of old coins is normal. Early adopters have already checked out last year when it went to new 200+ heights.... its silly to assume that they haven't bought stuff with the cash. Physical assets require maintenance - expensive vehicles, homes, properties, so its only normal that they keep withdrawing more of their coins from time to time (unless they had the foresight to roll their gains into traditional stocks). We're gonna see a lot more of that as we keep going forward.

As much as I would like to see this happen - it won't. First of all there are legitimate reasons as to not reveal your identity - if say your crypto exchange has relatively high volume, anybody knows you own a lot of money from transaction fees. And people generally don't like it when others "step out of line" and "achieve more than they deserve/ appeared to have worked for". A more realistic problem of course, is that the cryptosphere is currently plaqued by scammers of all suits and stripes who wouldn't want rightful karma to take a few shortcuts in catching up to them in the physical world.

With the price of BTC heading in the direction it is right now, you might as well cut out the middleman shit-delivery-app and just send BTC straight to the asshole you want to annoy.

The article is actually pretty thoughtful - especially on the wave-like adoption that is going on, and the weak-to-strong currency relationship. Same thing happened in Argentina, Russia, and all over the world when people sold their local currency en masse to buy the US dollar, thus naturally strengthening the dollar against their local currency. BTC is the gold standard of currency, so the events prophetsized in the article will come true sooner (~10-20 yrs) or later (~50 yrs, 2 generations).

Im in Canada, and if you think envy doesn't exist and people don't get shat on for making money in non-traditional ways, then I admire your naivety, and in part wish I still had something like that in me (I'm being serious). For example lets pick a random large exchange with anonymous owners, say Bittrex. On good days they make around $3000/day in transaction fees alone, and noone knows whether they get paid by altcoin devs to list new coins. Say I made that much...you really think knowing that you make $3000/day in passive income isn't going to make people see you in a different light? A good ~30% of people are busting their ass for $11/h nowadays, and I got a few friends in there. Heck, my friends making $40/h would be upset about that. And sour grapes from friends is the best case scenario, worst case scenario is extortion/etc which does happen to lottery winners quite a bit. Just being the devils advocate man, there are very legitimate users for anonymity not only for BTC users but company owners as well.

I wonder if Gox will be the largest heist in the history of BTC or something even larger will come along in the future.

Dear HashPlex, I am interested in industrial scale, open-case bitcoin mining. Do you offer any expertise to assist me in creating my own open-case bitcoin mine? Being an environmentalist, I am also concerned about the effects on environment such open-case mining creates. How do you rehabilitate your open-case bitcoin mines after all the bitcoins are exhausted?

Rare and underrated thought there man. Thanks, +1.

Wait a second, you got $1500 in the account and you're complaining that you can't transfer $3000 out? I'm sure bitcoin is gonna help in this case....
