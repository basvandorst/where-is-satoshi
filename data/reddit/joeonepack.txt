For a start larger blocks are completely out of the question in fact lukejr has already proved blocks should be 3 or more times smaller. Would you take the train if fast comfortable spacious buses could collect you from outside your home available 24/7. The answer is No........ If we do want companies, banks, institutions to build layer 2 solutions on-top of Bitcoin we must create a need or product whether that's a sidechain, LN hub or something else that improves on the frst layer some kind of magical scaling blockchain that everybody can use how exactly is anyone able to work with that? That would be like inventing the Internet and saying everyone can have as much of it as they want for next to no cost at any time no service providers or bandwidth restrictions or data bundles, pretty much no layer two business models.

Seriously dude please feel free to go think for yourself somewhere else, what is it with these people exactly??. We're going to build a wall buddy and make r/btc pay for it, best make sure you're on the right side of it.

Relax we can see your comment, trying to find the original version of this image now, pretty clear it's part of BU's anti-core campaign.

This behaviour bolsters my view that miners are just in it for the block reward, no real interest in Bitcoin or core just themselves no wonder every time we give them an update to run we just get a large face palm for our trouble. Meanwhile Mr lee who seems like a decent guy is prepping to roll out our segwit and LN hubs because he probably got all his miners onside, one implimentation much? Have core actually got a plan to get miners onside or just keep going on sleep over at these mining farms and hope they think we are best friends. Or maybe blockstream advice might be, excellent news segwit &amp; LN network is now live, anyone wishing to try it out please head to litecoin.org and download the latest wallet - sound good??

Chinese miners don't want seqwit, big blocks, LN, or even fees they want the block reward. Let's not be walking around on egg shells anymore blockstream will operate a LN hub, fee revenue will go directly to core development I'm pretty sure hubs will be updatable without having to head off to china with a translator and slideshow. Like chandler the miner said' F everybody we don't want control we want out of control, sounds like a solid pan, not.

I really hope they talk some sense into these Chinese mining cartels the sooner we can shift away from this mining setup the better. Isn't it possible for the leading companies in this space to keep an updated version of the blockchain these can connect to each other over the Internet, wouldn't this save on electricity and everyone buying mining gear that's outdated every few months.

Sigh, not another quote about something Satoshi is supposed to have said nearly 10 years back. I expect the Indians mining at this pool have no concept of BU, they have probably been promised by mr ver that Bitcoin is a frictionless zero fee payment system. Is it even worth the air fare for core to visit these guys?......... Maybe the next visit to china core makes we take more than a slideshow and translator you can bet mr ver is gaining ground and ingratiating himself by taking suitcases full of goodies as incentive. Maybe it's time to fight fire with fire and I don't mean simply handing out blockstream lapel pins.

Is there no way core can simply update the protocol without having to worry what these 8 Chinese dudes want. Its pretty clear they're only interested in block rewards not Bitcoin. I figured LN hubs were a way to solve chinese mining please tell me I wasn't wrong.

Criminal is too strong, the long and short of it is rbtc think development of Bitcoin should be free of charge like core builds all the roads and the miners get paid to taxi the users around. This isn't how the world works all who use the road network pay taxes for its maintenance we've tried to reinvent the wheel with Bitcoin and it's shaped like a square.

Just one point about the article, we don't want the unbanked spamming Bitcoin right?  that is the whole point of the fee market. This is like making buses free so the homeless will ride around on them all day just to keep warm - causing delays and making it incredibly uncomfortable for paying customers.

Pretty much everything that moves forward technology wise gets smaller with each iteration batterys, phones, thinner TVs, lower wattage led light bulbs. you tried reasoning with Chinese miners by offering segwit as an olive branch now its time to take it back from those guys who are holding Bitcoin hostage, minors have proved they won't listen they are too scared of progress in case it breaks their monopoly.

Can someone ELI5 !, has there been some Bitcoin ban?
