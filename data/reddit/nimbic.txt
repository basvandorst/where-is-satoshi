Do any insurance companies even offer "bitcoin" coverage? Or does it automatically fall under property insurance since the IRS considers it property even though it only exists digitally? It would be like buying an in game item and losing it when my account gets hacked... I have a hard time believing insurance would cover that, but I'm not an expert on insurance so maybe I'm wrong.

And Bitcoin doesn't care. True there are plenty of idiots spouting nonesense, but let's be real for a second... institutional investors don't care about that. Bitcoin stands on it's own and will march on no matter how many terrible youtube videos about imminent price moves are published a day. 
Real investors don't get their financial advice from Reddit and Twitter.
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:10:23
Eventually the price will plateau and the volatility will decrease... then people will start spending it. This could be another decade or two down the road however. When the price can 5x or more in a year no one wants to spend. We may be at $1 million+ per coin by then... who knows. Not even Satoshi
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:22:09
Hey I agree with you... but how many people actually use BTC to purchase things??? I would bet it's and extremely small fraction. Do you even know anyone that does? How often do you use it for eveyday purchases? Realistically the price is very volatile since it's such a young new asset class and the potential for return on investment is too great so most people have little incentive to use it as a currency.
While I truly believe BTC will eventually be used daily by a large percentage of the population, things like KYC at nearly every on ramp, high transaction fees, and slow transfers still show we have a ways to go. To be fair most of these problems are being worked on and will be fixed over time. A complete financial revolution doesn't happen overnight. This is something that will likely take decades, and I'm okay with that.
While I look forward to the day when people can opt get their paychecks in BTC, I also believe BTC won't be actually used for everyday transactions until the price stabilizes a bit. As the market matures and there is less volatility, and we start seeing 10% yearly gains instead of 500% + then people will be much more likely to spend.
I think your hostility towards investors is misplaced. Many of us are also real believers in BTC, but it's unrealistic to expect people to spend an asset that could go up in value enough to legitimately change their lives. No one wants to be the next "pizza guy". Usage will naturally increase with stability. 
BTC is still in the process of establishing itself and the ecosystem it lives in and depends on... things like Lightning Network are a great step forward, but for the everyday users their on ramp to BTC is still too difficult, most people acquire it from and centralized exchange which means KYC and now paying taxes every time you spend it. Your average mom, dad, and grandma aren't going to use a VPN and coinjoin to make sure they are able to have the privacy and financial freedom BTC was meant for. This whole process needs to become easier, more private, and more decentralized... and I believe it will eventually.

Having the same issue here,  they denied me to be allowed withdrawal twice and I'm still waiting to hear back from customer service. Might try the Twitter route and see how that goes.
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:37:52
Ah, I bought mine before that. I use it when I don't have time to do a pour over, but I thought they had changed it so you can use your own pods since everyone was complaining? If you really can't then it's a deal breaker for me. I NEVER use premade pods. No way to know how long it's been sitting there going stale. Fresh roasted and ground beans are the only way to go!

I just made a purchase with cash app. I compared how much ₿TC I could purchase between coinbase and Cash App. $50 on Coinbase would have allowed me to purchase 0.00428681. And on Cash App for the same $50 I was able to purchase 0.00441891 ₿TC.  So the difference was 0.0001321 BTC or about $1.50 at the current price. 
So even with the market price of BTC listed on Cash App being about $200 higher than the price on Coinbase, it was still a better deal. Hope that helps!
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:26:14
Wait... what did I miss here?
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:00:27
A lot of us were expecting a significant retracement around that period. I started taking profit at $12k. While calling the exact top or bottom of a movement is nearly impossible, reading trends and proven trading techniques work just fine. And of course you might not be right and every last trade as long as you aren't overly greedy, making a few percent here and there is relatively easy. 
Saying it could be back to $3k next week is also kinda silly. We've already established the next bull cycle, and while the fall from 13 to 10 may have seemed massive it was not that big of a move in the overall scheme of things. There is a lot of structural and psychological support well before 3k, specifically $8.5k is a big support zone and even getting back down to that level could take a weeks.
I'm not saying anyone has 100% the answer as to what BTC is going to do within the next five minutes... but you can absolutely guess what is going to happen long term by analyzing trends and applying that to your shorter term trades.

They are full of crap. They are the ones literally begging for government oversight and taxation. Screw them and their centralized exchange.
@_date: 2019-07-29 06:25:44
Funny... I hate them. I hope their exchange burns to the ground and all their Bitcoin gets stolen. They are terrible for Bitcoin, they are terrible for privacy, they are just all around bad. They are exactly what's wrong with the crypto world right now. Sure they have lots of money and influence... and that should scare the hell out of anyone that cares about the future of Bitcoin especially in the United States.
@_date: 2019-07-29 06:50:12
Yeah totally... we should just let them tax our taxes while we're at it. In fact we should just send our paychecks directly to the Feds, I'm sure they will give us a fair allowance! Getting taxed to death on our income isn't so bad, I don't mind also paying thousands of dollars every year on property tax either... or the taxes on my phone bill that I pay with my already taxed income, or the taxes at the grocery store, or the $0.40 a gallon tax I pay every time I fill up my car that I have to pay additional fees and taxes on every year. It's okay they are adding extra taxes on soda and foods that contain sugar, after all it's for my own good! Of course they should ALSO tax the tiny bit of money I have left over that I wisely chose to invest, rather than wasting it so I don't go into debt... 
But at least we can sleep well at night knowing ALL those tax dollars are going to be spent only on the most important things that definitely benefit us right? Because the govt would never spend MY money on wasteful and unnecessary projects, like providing homeless people that don't pay ANY taxes with mobile injection sites so they can get high safely and then get arrested and thrown in the prison system that's also paid for by MY money. But at least the prisons are focused on rehabilitating inmates and returning them as quickly as possible back into society as reformed productive members riiiight??
Yeah. Sorry for the rant. I'm not advocating for anyone to attempt tax evasion... but taxes are something that seriously piss me off. The govt is wasting TRILLIONS while racking up an unbelievable amount of debt that IS going to collapse our economy... all because those bastards refuse to use MY hard earned money responsibly. 
Any person that budgeted like the govt does would be broke and living on the streets... WHY tf do we let them continue to get away with this?! People will look back in disgust and wonder why we allowed it to happen. We're only screwing ourselves. 
Screw their unfair taxes, screw their wasteful spending, screw their insanely complicated tax codes, screw the politicians that continue to kick the can down the road, and screw all of us for allowing it to happen.

It's not that I'm struggling to buy groceries, it's that I'm NOT struggling to buy BTC. But when it comes to buying other things... I just don't want to waste my money on things as unnecessary as food and utilities when I could be buying more Bitcoin instead. 
The wife disagrees. It's pretty much the only thing we argue about. Actually, it's not really an argument... I just say the word Bitcoin and she sighs and then tunes out my 30 minute speech about why banks are bad and fiat is doomed.

Sure but tax laws regarding crypto are immature at best, you never know what crazy ways they may try to restrict it or tax it later down the road. Long term holding is still probably the safest bet though.
@_date: 2019-07-29 06:56:48
So what happens if you say your wallet was hacked or you lost your keys? This actually does happen... do you file it as a loss and get a deduction??? This whole thing is a mess and they haven't provided near enough clarification for people to take it seriously.
@_date: 2019-07-01 06:09:31
I wish that would happen, buy anything much below $8,500 seems pretty unlikely. There might be a quick wick into the $7k area, perhaps you might bet lucky if you have a buy order waiting. 
I'd the correction continues we're drop to $10k then 9.5k and see if it bounces back from there or goes all the way to $8.5k 
I'm guessing this pull back lasts 2 weeks to maybe a month and then it's vertical time again. If it lasts till September I'll be very happy though.
@_date: 2019-07-11 08:24:58
PSA: Telling people how much BTC you own is not usually a good idea. If you have paid your taxes and claim all of your crypto holdings then at least you might not have to worry about the IRS, but as the price increases you may become a target. I suggest using TOR and make sure to anonymize your coins after buying them and store them in a separate wallet until they are "cleaned" and then send then to a different wallet for your safe coins. 
Bitcoin is NOT anonymous by default especially if you use a centralized exchange... it would be very easy for the Govt to obtain your personal information, and possible for hackers as well. Stay safe and good luck.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:26:12
Thanks for the links... didn't know about libertyx. There's actually a few near me and their price is way better than trying to deal with localbitcoin premiums and I can pay cash with no KYC. I'm definitely going there to buy this dip! This is going to my samourai wallet then a coinjoin and I won't be worried about my financial privacy anymore.
@_date: 2019-07-30 20:26:32
Excellent post, it should be mandatory reading for all newcomers to Bitcoin. And every KYC exchange should have a pop up each time you log on reminding users that their privacy is not and can not be guaranteed or even expected without further action by the user. 
Make no mistake... Bitcoin is a revolution, and there will be a fight. Regulations and taxes are already here.  Prepare now or expect the govt to seize your assets if they aren't secured. They will do everything in their power to stay in control
@_date: 2019-07-22 23:57:54
I agree for the most part, but as someone who has lost coins when exchanges get hacked or go bankrupt I've learned the hardway not to trust anyone else with holding them. 
And while regulation is pretty much inevitable, it is against the core belief of why Bitcoin was created in the first place. Sure, it might be easy to take your coins off an exchange now... but 5 or 10 years from now?? Probably not. I don't want or need the government tracking all my purchases and transfers, and there is no reason why they should. But they will if we let them.
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:47:34
Yeah, I've noticed it's usually about 2-3 hundred above market average. Basically they even say on their app that they change the market rate depending on volatility and that their rate may not reflect true market prices. I just see it as how they get their 1% fee.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:41:06
I'm betting this was a brilliant move to draw out coin holders into responding to his tweet so they can try and track down holders that haven't paid taxes. Nice try IRS!
@_date: 2019-07-29 07:10:16
It's not just the ATMs... most places charge a hidden fee like this. Coinbase definitely marks up the price when you buy, so does CashApp, and good look getting even remotely close to the actual price on LocalBitcoins or pretty much anyone selling BTC for cash or giftcards. Unfortunately it's just how it works. Some are compensating for overhead costs and market fluctuations, others just know they have clients willing to pay a premium for the ability to use cash. 
I do agree a market price listing and their markup being visible would be nice... but it isn't hard to look up the current price of Bitcoin at any given time and do a tiny bit of math yourself.
@_date: 2019-07-22 22:31:02
I'm assuming here, but I'd imagine the majority of coinbase users keep their assets in coinbase custody rather than transfer them out into a private wallet. So they don't hold the keys to their coins. I consider that an issue since it kinda defeats the point of Bitcoin... giving a centralized business control over your asset's.
@_date: 2019-07-16 02:23:33
I'm not so sure. Somewhere down the line, employers might be forced to issue fedcoins to their employees, that way the feds can track your income and they'll know if you trade your fedcoin for BTC. 
This will lower adoption rates, and many normies will be scared of the evil Bitcoin portrayed by the media as the money of drug lords and evil doers.
@_date: 2019-07-27 04:32:56
That's not what I view as "tainted". I consider it tainted if it was bought on an exchange using KYC and hasn't been anonymized through the use of a coinjoin. It's VERY easy to track BTC so steps should be taken to ensure your own privacy.
@_date: 2019-07-30 20:45:45
I agree to not take out a loan... but saying it won't moon like it's an absolute certainty is a statement you can't promise. It could absolutely shoot up to $15k in a week and not come back down.  
For example if the price goes to $15,000 he now could only purchase about .633 BTC with $9,500 he could have spent to buy 1 full BTC  now.
So to be fair, he may end up spending more money long term even with the cost of interest calculated in.
And while DCA is probably the best strategy for the average investor, it always stings a little if you start at the bottom and it just keeps going up. Personally I would buy as much as possible now without taking out a loan, and then DCA in with a recurring buy of a set amount every other week. And of course if he can save a little extra to put aside in case there is a sweet dip, that helps too. 
Either way like everyone has said, don't spend more than what is comfortable and if you are losing sleep at night over this... you're doing it wrong! Be happy you're getting in now and sleep well knowing you're still an early adopter. Good luck
@_date: 2019-07-30 01:29:17
I agree with most of what you said. We just differ on the fundamentals. Bitcoin doesn't NEED regulation. It was working just fine without it. Is it inevitable... maybe, whether I like it or not. Of course the govt is going to take every action possible to control it. 
The statement I disagree with most is about it being in the "eyes of the people who matter". Screw that. Rich old guys, feds, politicians, bankers... they aren't people who matter to me. I hope none of them buy anymore bitcoin and become relagated to the dustbin of history. Those liars, cheats, and greedy swindlers don't need to be part of the Bitcoin community. They are the same people that are destroying the current financial ecosystem... what makes you think they won't try to ruin Bitcoin as well??
That's a hard pass from me.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:47:52
Because the point of Bitcoin is to take back control of our financial sovereignty. Govts are starting to go after crypto holders, just a matter of time till they try to control or ban all the on ramps that require KYC.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:09:22
I mean what's your time frame for "don't count on it" ?  It's extremely likely and probably sooner than you think. None of us know the future, but it's hard to NOT see BTC well above $100,000 within 5 - 10 years... and that's being very generous
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:35:57
Alright, I'll look into it and update.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:43:11
The problem remains though of "not your keys, not your wallet" the fact that coinbase now has 30 million accounts shows that even people buying Bitcoin don't understand this huge problem.  
And also the issue of My keys... uh, crap... where'd my keys go? It's very very very easy for people to lose BTC by losing their keys or sending it to the wrong address. Until these two problems are fixed I think individual adoption will be slow. And to be clear, I think that's okay. Bitcoin is a huge thing... it needs time to grow and figure out all these issues in a way that's safe, secure, and user friendly. If we get mass adoption before these problems are resolved it will create more issues than it solves.

I know! The buying opportunities are amazing! Remember everyone wishing they had bought more at $6k when price hit $14k? Well now's your chance! 
If you aren't buying, don't be crying later. Personally I'm hoping it keeps right on falling, but $6,500 was my absolute buy as much as I can number. This is amazing and I'm so happy right now!
@_date: 2019-11-09 02:49:20
I tend to agree with you here. This looks like we've only confirmed another lower high on the higher time frame and have now broken through support, a drop back to $7k and lower seems likely. 
At the end of the day Bitcoin is gonna do what Bitcoin does regardless of any pattern or opinions we have, but I wouldn't be caught holding a long position right now.
@_date: 2019-11-09 05:52:10
Well the good news is it doesn't really matter about what analysis we come up with... all you need to know is buy Bitcoin and wait. Day traders get rekt 90% of the time unless they're seriously talented and committed. I just try and time the dips for my next buy, selling isn't something I plan on doing for a looong time.
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:31:27
Sounds awesome! Just please keep your BTC in your own personal wallet and keep the keys somewhere VERY VERY safe! Make a backup copy somewhere else that's even safer! Don't touch an exchange after you convert your alts to BTC and exit the market. And definitely don't even mention your holdings to anyone while you are abroad, you don't want to make yourself a target! Be safe and good luck!
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:50:45

The days of the average joe being able to buy 1 full BTC are entering the final days I'm afraid. It will be absolutely crazy to see where the next few bull runs take us! I'm secretly hoping the smart whales that bought in early will dump hard on the late whales before the end of this run. One last flash sale for us.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:58:30
Bold strategy Cotton, let's see if it pays off.  
I don't have the balls for that. I do believe it will dip lower, but I've been wrong more than a few times with Bitcoin price action. 
I bought a lil today, and I'll buy a lil more on the next dip. The bigger the dip, the bigger the buy.
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:52:25
Well the satoshi wallet has 1 million that's never going anywhere so there's that. Plus about 20% lost forever in the early days... so there's what, maybe 15 or 16 million BTC in the wild? Plus half that's likely being held long term. I think there's something like a million BTC that haven't moved in the last 8 years... so likely forgotten/lost or rhey are holding forever.
@_date: 2019-08-03 05:15:14

It's always a good time to buy. Unless you're planning on selling immediately, now is the best time to buy. If you are a believer in Bitcoin, you should feel pretty comfy.
Buying more than you can afford to lose is always a dumb idea, I buy as much as I can afford, no more and no less. I also never sell. If you're in it for the long haul you shouldn't be bothered by little dips like this. Just be glad you're buying before this bull run really takes off.
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:29:53
Yeah I'm guessing 5% won't be enough. There are a few hidden costs to operating an ATM. Depending on the country there are licenses and fees associated with just owning them regardless of how much you sell, plus you will be taxed pretty heavily I'm guessing, plus the cost of the machine itself. If you have very high use maybe you can get away with cheaper than 25% but pretty much every in person sale of BTC for cash has a very high mark up, at 15% you would still be very competitive. 
Add up all the costs and see what you can manage. It's nice to want to give people a great rate, but it won't help if you go out of business within a year.
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:50:23
I must have checked during a major price swing last time, the prices seem much more reasonable now. However I was really looking for cash in person.

Well to be fair... it depends on what level of shtf we talkin about here. Extinction level events... yeah BTC and everything else that relies on the internet will be worthless. But medium levels of shtf then yeah BTC may be way better to have and travel with. If you get robbed, supplies and cash are easy to find and steal. A thumb drive or paper wallet can be hidden a lot of places. 
Land is always a good buy, but stocks... well, let's hope the market stays afloat.
@_date: 2019-08-23 00:05:14
They don't charge miner fees, but the miners do. At least the miner charge was passed on to me from coinbase the last time I withdrew from them. 
I started using CashApp, it has its flaws but I've done side by side comparisons and you get more BTC for your Buck using CashApp. They don't charge fees but they do hike up the price of BTC by about $150 to make up for it. And you have to go through KYC and get approved to withdraw, which for me was a serious pain in the butt, took almost a month. 
Both are of course inferior because of the KYC requirements if you care about privacy so keep that in mind.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:43:26
I dunno, I'm still just about breaking even. Not too worried. Just trying to decide the best time to buy more.
@_date: 2019-08-03 05:20:11
Well it's still way way cheaper than any price on local bitcoins or any other p2p site that I've seen. But yeah if you have to KYC anyway, still not worth it.
@_date: 2019-10-12 14:40:13
With $200 I doubt investing in stocks would yield much of a return after all the fees. Even if he were experienced and didn't have to pay fees trading stocks especially when we're potentially on the brink of a major economic downturn is pretty unlikely to be very profitable. Diversity is fine if you have enough money and time. But with such a small initial investment you can't afford to diversify much imo
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:16:34

True, but ₿TC is still in it's infancy. There are billions of people that own Zero Bitcoin. I don't expect BTC to hit 10,000,000 any time soon but I believe it could definitely happen before I die. The more I learn about Bitcoin over time, the more I'm convinced it's much more than just a store of value. It's really a financial revolution that will absolutely change the world.
@_date: 2019-08-03 05:39:13
This... send fiat to pro to avoid the excessive fees.  Also, after buying send to a wallet off exchange. And utilize a coinjoin if you want to maintain privacy with any transactions after you leave the exchange. 
If you're looking for some good info, the "tales from the crypt" podcast interviews a lot of interesting players in the Bitcoin world. You learn a lot about BTC history and current tech and they keep it entertaining. Or at least I think so. 
Never stop learning.
@_date: 2019-10-20 18:42:57
I agree with this. Straight DCA is great for ppl who don't want to deal with the hassle of timing buys or watching the market waiting for dips... but buying dips, even small ones makes a difference. 
I buy every week but if there's a clear pattern resolution coming up soon I'll often wait to see if it breaks to the downside before I buy. Right now a price difference of a few sats might not seem like much, but if you are a long term holder that believes price will go upwards of $1,000,000 per coin some day... even with a small purchase the difference between buying before the dip or during it could be worth thousands of dollars later on. That's what I consider before making each and every buy.
That being said, if it's been trading sideways or up for an extended period of time with no clear signal for a pull back in the immediate future, I'll buy away and not worry about it at all. 
It's all about how much time and effort you're willing to put into your investment. DCA is great for the busy or lazy, but buying the dips is best for those with a little knowledge, just don't try and time the exact bottom and wait for it to dip just a little lower... that's a great way to miss it altogether. 
Either way, we're all lucky to be buying now. Keep stacking sats and enjoy the ride!

I think it's okay to buy on the way up if you're either just starting and going with DCA automatically buys, or you have some knowledge of charts and plan on selling the top and buying back in during the next bear market. If you can't afford to buy a lot of ₿TC then swing trading is the easiest way to increase your holding, although it can be a bit nerve wracking if you don't have much experience in it.
@_date: 2019-08-22 22:42:24
The answer is... no one knows.  I think so many people got burned so hard by alts recently that most are a little gunshy now. I won't go so far as to say alts will never pump again, but BTC is still in an overall uptrend... no one wants to be caught in alts while BTC starts its next major pump. 
Perhaps if this current massive sideways consolidation triangle we're in breaks to the downside we'll see some sort of rise in alts.

Obviously nothing is sure. Modern society could collapse next year for all we know. But the number of people that are so hugely passionate about this project is amazing, couple that with the very rich players starting to get invested in BTC and it's a recipe for success. There's so many reasons why BTC should continue to succeed and very few for why it should fail. It's truly the future of money. 
Maybe I've just been listening to too many podcast from ppl in the industry, but the true impact of ₿itcoin has barely just started to be understood. It's like the invention of the internet, very few people could even imagine the enormous impact it would have on the entire world, it didn't just shape markets... it created entire new ones. And it's still expanding. 
Bitcoin will do the same thing for the financial industry, and we're still at the very cusp of its inception. Very powerful people have begun throwing millions of dollars into Bitcoin, they are beginning to see it's potential and want to ensure they take advantage of this emerging market. I'll never have as much as the elite, but buying now is really a once in a lifetime opportunity. People will look back at this time just like we look back at when BTC was less than a dollar... if I knew then what I know now, I would have sunk a ton of money into BTC and I'd be insanely wealthy right now. 
I'm not going to reverse mortgage my house to buy more crypto because that's irresponsible, but I absolutely believe I'll regret it forever if I don't buy as much as I safely can afford before this dip ends.

Ah okay, so you don't mean Bitcoin will never go up a lot in value, but rather this bull run will be a slower run up compared to last time? 
That's definitely possible, as more and more institutional money comes in I would expect less volatility and slower runs. I'm not sure if we're there yet, FOMO is a powerful drug and there's still a ridiculous amount of people just now getting into BTC for the first time. I guess time will tell, either way I'm holding and hoping.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:55:09
Im 100% okay with that
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:03:15
Lol... says the druggie. Bitcoin is actually really bad if you're trying to hide your purchases since everything is stored publicly on the blockchain forever. Sure, there are ways around it by mixing and coin joins, but it isn't  "inherent"  and certainly not the intent behind it's creation.
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:33:27
Thanks, this is the ₿est!
@_date: 2019-10-20 19:22:42
That's the basic idea, however some whales are very rich and smart... so I wouldn't bet on being able to drain many whales. Also new whales will be entering the market over time so the problem will be ongoing. 
Also, X days without a dip shouldn't be an automatic buy. Of we are in a decending triangle that's 75% complete, a dip might be imminent even if it's gone past the set time limit. You might make your normal daily or weekly buy, but it would suck to have waited a month or two, spend all the accrued money because a fixed number of days passed only to miss the dip by a day or two. 
Perhaps spend a % of the accrued money after X number of days if we are in an obvious pattern that is likely to break to the downside.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:28:08
Ah I see what you mean now, although 5k may not mean as much when the price gets really high... that may end up only being a couple percent someday soon!

I wouldn't borrow money to buy crypto. I don't like being in debt, I buy with money already in my account.  Paying any interest is a waste if you can avoid it.

Not tryna be rude but you might want to do a little more research on the twins.  They are far from being "good" to crypto. They might be nice people in general, but they are definitely bad for cryptocurrency.

When no KYC?
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:15:06
It's hard to predict the top but I'm thinking it gets closer to 80-100k then drops to 30-40k. I still think this run up will be fairly quick but with each time the cycle will likely get longer and longer. The rate of return will decay and the market will stabilize but we are still pretty early in the life cycle and the volume of money entering will drive massive movements, but each cycle it will be harder and harder to get lambo gains.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:56:37
Well you did good on your last trade, but I definitely wouldn't wait around for it to hit 5k or you will miss out. The safe end of this retracement has already been hit at 30%.  We MIGHT make it back down a tad below 9k but even that isn't for sure. 
As far as I'm concerned the bear market ended a while ago. This is a small pullback and it's extremely unlikely you will ever see ₿TC get back down to 5k. There aren't a lot of pull backs after ₿TC starts it's bullruns, and as they say - dumb bulls fair better than smart bears in a bull market. 
At the very least buy the dip and if it dips harder, buy more.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:53:37
And why do you think they were your only option? Possibly because the Winklevoss twins went to the feds and literally asked for crypto exchanges to be regulated before the feds were even really looking at it. Yes, I get institutional buyers want regulations, and want to pay taxes, but requiring users to give up their privacy and be forced into a centralized means of obtaining and transferring ₿TC goes against the very reason why ₿TC exists to begin with. 
Anything that restricts access to Bitcoin or it's use should be fought. I don't blame you, it's still a little complicated to purchase Bitcoin "legally" without going through a centralized exchange... but I think overcoming that issue should be our primary focus right now.
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:44:31
What makes you say "not that much" and in your opinion what would not much look like?
@_date: 2019-06-11 04:48:10
Because I pay it off every month so I never get charged interest, I earn over $1k cash back a year for free, and it helps build my credit score. There is literally no down side.
@_date: 2019-06-11 02:47:43
I beg to differ... there are many kind people in crypto! But also many people that are financially intelligent... just because you don't give money to a stranger doesn't mean you aren't kind.
@_date: 2019-06-07 22:07:47
This is definitely a possible scenario. I do think it will take longer than most ppl seem to realize before we reach a new ath, the major difference this time around seems to be the type of people investing... big players are entering the space, lots of multi-million dollar buyers all looking to buy "the bottom". 
I expect there will be some huge buy orders from new whales entering now that the bear market has officially bottomed out and started the slow path towards the next bull run. With each cycle ₿TC gains more acceptance and is seen as a more legitimate investment. I'm incredibly bullish on price long term, impossible to say 100% what the price will do between now and then, but I'm still making regular buys. 
Good luck to us all, stack the sats and keep holding. We really are still early buyers.
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:13:17

Lol definitely not the worst crash in history because it wasn't even a crash... it was an expected retracement and I sold on the way up. Didn't make the exact top but close enough, holding is great but selling tops and buying bottoms means essentially free bitcoin just for clicking a few buttons.

What was the estimate... something like 30% of BTC is lost forever?  Somewhere around 14,700,000 is probably closer to the true amount of BTC able to be accessed. And over time more BTC will become lost here and there decreasing the supply further. 
If you have one full Bitcoin today and hold it... it's hard to imagine what it might be worth 15-20 years from now. We are extremely lucky to be living in this time, it's like owning a massive oil field right as automobiles are being invented. 
I tell my wife all the time, someday our kids will be very thankful their Dad decided to buy as much Bitcoin as he could so early. I imagine my photo hanging in my grand children's mansion they purchased with 0.03 BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-11 05:24:33
So not needing a line of credit makes me dumb? Okay... very intellectual debate. I'll try not being mean since it's not nice to make fun of children and I'm guessing you're probably around 12. 
If you have to borrow money to buy something that means you incur debt and interest on top of it... there is zero reason for me to do that when I can just take money out of my checking or savings account for free. 
Specifically referring to investments like Bitcoin, if you can't afford it without taking out a loan or buying it on credit then you shouldn't be buying it at all. That basic financial common sense.

Now isn't a "bad" time to buy, and we'll probably bounce up from here but we're likely to see the downtrend continue below $7k in the days or weeks to come. Dollar cost Averaging is the way to go, but I'm personally waiting till it bottoms out before making my big buys. 
I'm also a scaredy cat so I'm not selling now either just to be safe.  But if you have very limited funds MAYBE consider waiting to see how this plays out.
@_date: 2019-06-11 02:18:58
Well I guess that just depends on how much you invested originally, investing $50 that goes 8000% isn't life changing. My wife is having a hard time understanding, she keeps telling me it's fake money that doesn't really exist
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:23:33
They can't "ban" Bitcoin but they can regulate it off every centralized exchange. I live in Washington state and they passed laws a couple years back that made it extremely difficult for any legitimate business to deal in crypto. ShapeShift was a prime example, they had a big notice on their site explaining why they could no longer do business in my state and also why they thought it was B.S. however as much as they disagreed with it they still had to comply with it or they would get shut down. 
The same goes with gun laws. Pretty much every major firearm and gun accessory company is against unconstitutional and overly restrictive gun laws, yet they still won't ship 30 round magazines to California because they know they would likely have their business shutdown, face major fines, and even jail time. 
In the case of crypto it may end up being a similar situation as gun control, they won't ban everything all at once... but rather it will be a death by a thousand cuts. First they will target obvious ICO scams because they are dangerous and take advantage of people... no one will argue. Then of course the KYC requirements, Banning exchanges that don't comply with Federal law "for the safety of the consumer" of course, and each time a new ban or regulation is allowed the harder it will be to fight back the next time. 
The Feds are extremely powerful and BTC will either be controlled by them or banned. As long as they get their tax dollars they may let it slide for awhile, but when it becomes truly mainstream expect massive regulations. Sure you can still access BTC through VPNs and decentralized exchanges... but if you get caught avoiding taxes or skirting whatever ridiculous rules they come up with, expect to have your accounts frozen and heavy fines. 
Of course I have to say I'm still extremely bullish on BTC long term despite knowing the Govt will likely try to control or limit it's influence... and it's because BTC is something the world needs, it solves huge problems and is so much better than the current financial system status quo. I have very little faith in fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:08:41
Ah yes, forgot about the page in the white paper where satoshi said we need to follow govt regulations. /s

Well you're not wrong saying whales can move the price down to increase their stack for basically free... that analogy isn't the best. 60:40 is still gambling, if someone said they'd pay me a million bitcoin to jump off a bridge and I had a 60% chance of surviving, no way in hell I'm gonna jump. 
But this most recent move wasn't even that risky. The whale timed it great, right as we were losing momentum and many investors were already expecting a pullback. To me this is less manipulation and more just smart money selling the top of first big run in this new bull market. Sure there was some risk, but like you said they tipped the odds in their favor with the big sell order. Even without the whale, the price would have likely gone down anyway, just maybe not right now or as fast.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:19:07
Meh, I'm unironically waiting for 10,000,000 ₿itcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:22:38
It's not a crash. Lots of TA "experts" are expecting a decline back to around $4,500 before we hit bottom. 
If that scares you... guess you're new. I get more excited for dips than I do Bull runs, because it means I get to buy more. If you're day trading to make a profit, well good luck. Most who try fail unless they have previous experience, and many of them take a loss too.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:04:48
You might be right. You also might be wrong. A healthy retracement is expected at some point soon.  Hold and wait for the next run up, or sell and buy back when it dips. Win win either way.

@_date: 2019-06-28 13:43:48
You miss the point. A regulated Bitcoin is no bitcoin at all.  It was created because the govt and banks should not be allowed to control us through our money.  When we opt in to a centralized exchange you're feeding the system bitcoin was built to fight.  Bitcoin is a revolution. It can and does work without govt oversight and KYC.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:41:31
There are plenty of people thinking the ultimate end target of this down trend is around $4,500
So if you want to double down... I'd exercise a little patience and wait for a clear reversal signal before putting a lot of money down. I'm still making my normal small purchases, but I'm definitely waiting to make my big buys until we know where the bottom is, either waybthe important thing is after you buy, just keep holding and holding and holding
@_date: 2019-12-30 18:20:54
It's really not that different, besides 50 years ago if you told someone the Patriot Act would become law they probably would have laughed at you because it's so Orwellian and destroys individual rights to privacy... and yet barely anyone even blinked when it passed, heck a lot of people were cheering for it. Don't underestimate what the Govt is willing to do for "safety and security"
@_date: 2019-12-27 02:29:04
It could still dip into the red for a little bit. This support seems less than confidence inspiring. I'm holding some buys just in case we break. $4,500 is my lowest target. I have no idea if we'll hit it but I sure as hell hope we do. I'll be buying like crazy.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:03:43
It's funny how people only ready the title
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:30:23
I'll start buying at $6,800, and keep buying as it heads lower! In the short term we could see a bounce back above $8k and swing traders could make a decent profit, but every indication is showing this falls below $7k eventually. Smart money is waiting. 
If you buy now... not that big of a deal, we all know we're still at the start of a bull run so if you just hold you will be fine. If you sell now, just fill up when it bottoms out. The only bad play here is waiting for the bottom to sell. Don't do that and you're set.

So you don't think there's anything wrong with the Patriot Act? Besides there doesn't need to be a conspiracy theory... the Govt is greedy and power hungry, that's how it is by default. Anytime you concentrate that much power and wealth in one place corruption is inevitable. And if you don't think the Govt is capable of doing something large scale that effects us all without a vote or public knowledge then do a little more research. Ever heard of the Bay of Pigs, Operation Northwoods, how about the Manhattan Project? These aren't crazy conspiracy theories, they are well known public facts. The Govt is willing and able to enforce whatever agenda it thinks is best. Anyone that blindly trusts that the Govt has their best interest at heart needs a major wake up call. 
I'm not saying they will definitely force Govt controlled blockchain down our throat, but they could and would if they wanted to
@_date: 2019-12-30 18:10:49
They would likely force businesses to adopt it first, and then the population can "choose" to start using fedcoin if they want to buy the newest Iphone or whatever. Besides people probably thought the sane thing about gold, but the Govt did a mandatory buyback program forcing all citizens to hand over their gold in exchange for cash... very similar to this.
@_date: 2019-06-11 02:45:37

All fiat may eventually end up on a blockchain because there are so many benefits to the Govt, and so few to the citizens. It's a very dystopian anti-Bitcoin system that would further enslave us financially. Which is why Bitcoin will be a much more appealing alternative in the future.
@_date: 2019-04-21 06:05:03
I just saw a massive add for Gemini in San Francisco. I would never use it though. It's owned by the Winklevoss twins and I hate them, they are purely about financial gain and have literally asked for more regulation from the feds. Screw those guys. They probably forward all your trades directly to the IRS.
@_date: 2019-12-30 17:46:12
Sure you can't just create more Bitcoin, but if they created a "fedcoin" alternative to Bitcoin they could create as many as they want whenever they want because they would be in control. They wouldn't make it completely decentralized like bitcoin, they would likely be the only ones able to track every transaction. There is absolutely massive benefits to the Govt especially for countries like China that overtly monitor everything their citizens do to begin with.
@_date: 2019-12-30 17:26:41
True, there would be some benefit there for us as well, however I'm positive that the govt would not spend it's own money on the blockchain, they would figure away around it. Part of the reason I'm so sure of that is the many billions of dollars spent on classified "black projects" they don't want the public or foreign adversaries knowing about. 
They will have excptions to exempt themselves because the Govt is corrupt at it's core.
@_date: 2019-04-27 00:02:35

@_date: 2019-04-25 22:35:44
They seriously can't do anything to fix this... and their fees are pretty standard  compared to various online stock trading sites. The thing I don't like is that when you make a purchase they purposefully wait until the price spikes to put your order through.  I've witnessed several times where I would press buy and then when I go back and look at the charts, my purchase price would match the highest price reached that day for the coin, often hours after I pressed buy. 
Coinbase offers a good service for people that don't know a lot about crypto or don't want to deal with creating a wallet etc. It's easy to use and set up. And yes, they do charge a fee for that service. At least they haven't been rocked with any major breaches. Hacks, or scandals... yet.
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:24:27
Social media, okay. There are lots of "professionals" trying to predict the price and almost none of them are saying 100k or more for the next ATH. I would expect strong resistance at all the normal psychological resistance points, and if we manage to break the previous ATH I'd suggest we may hit $30k-$50k. 
I seriously doubt we go higher than that this time around, but crypto is gonna do what crypto does. No one knows where it will be a year from now. 
Also there are plenty of predictions for BTC not even breaking $7k for the rest of the year either. So I'm guessing your 250-300k estimates are mostly coming from crypto newbs hoping for lambos by next year. This is the kind of thinking that produces crying bag holders... the whales love them. 
To be fair, I'm glad you have a lot of enthusiasm and that you are trying to plan your moves ahead. I shouldn't be giving you so much hate.  Just please try not to get too caught up in the hype. And keep a very close eye on the market. And please don't trust anything you read on social media.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:42:47


I wouldn't sell, There's a small chance they won't close and if that happens the price spikes back up really fast and you lose out. If they close the price will plunge pretty quick, I'm guessing another %15 percent down if not more. I'd bet buying at $2,700 would be good. There's a lot of support at $3k, but it might punch through. So if you can afford it just hold what you have and purchase more at the low when the news breaks tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:19:29
I'm holding, if the bottom drops out due to an announcement from China I'm going to buy as much as I can. But if an announcement doesn't come out this week I'll buy if it looks like it's trending up.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:13:01
Well from what I understand, the Chinese govt didn't officially close the first exchange, they are shutting down voluntarily because they know a shutdown is coming so they are just getting it over with. The other two are either hesitant to announce or are hoping for a last minute change of heart from the government. But there are plenty of corrupt officials in China, so it could also be part of some sort of insider trading scam, who knows?
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:19:41
Hard to say, sometime tomorrow China time, so maybe 2am if you're in the U.S. but they may wait till the end of the day to release the info which would put it closer to 6am Friday. There's also a chance they meet with regulators and don't announce anything for another day or so, but I feel this is unlikely due to the pressure it's putting on the market. My bet is it will be closer to early Friday morning. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:33:28
Nope, hold. The last two exchanges meet with regulators in China tomorrow, if they announce they are closing the price will plunge way further, buy then! If they say they are not closing expect a very quick rise in price then stabilizing. These exchanges are the big ones, it will have a major effect on price. My instinct is saying they will close, so buckle up and brace yourselves. I'm holding and getting ready to buy a lot!

@_date: 2017-09-09 14:47:05
Basically a ton of people have buy orders set at that price because they feel that's the cheapest they will get it at. So once a buy wall forms that big, it will force the price back up and eat through sell orders crazy fast as sellers flee to higher prices to avoid selling at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:19:41

@_date: 2017-09-14 23:42:47


I wouldn't sell, There's a small chance they won't close and if that happens the price spikes back up really fast and you lose out. If they close the price will plunge pretty quick, I'm guessing another %15 percent down if not more. I'd bet buying at $2,700 would be good. There's a lot of support at $3k, but it might punch through. So if you can afford it just hold what you have and purchase more at the low when the news breaks tomorrow.

More China fud is slowing us down I think. This will be a drawn out for another month at least I think, pretty unpredictable right now I'd say. It'll definitely go back up eventually, but may dip again first
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:38:36
What's your goal... long term investment or short term? I'd say it's a little late if you're trying to spend $100 now and hoping to have millions in 5 years, but there are plenty of decent up and coming alt coins you could buy for pretty cheap now that may blow up soon. No matter how much you invest in bitcoin it is likely to earn you a decent percentage over the next few years. But let's say you buy .05 bitcoin for around $200 bucks and the value of bitcoin reached $10k. Your $200 Is now worth $500. I'd say that's a decent profit. Now let's suppose you buy an alt coin that's selling for $0.20 right now with that same original investment.  You can purchase 1,000 coins with $200. If the coin goes up to $5 you now have $5,000. Not bad for a $200 investment. 
Now before you go pumping money into every alt coin under a dollar, remember many will see very little if any rise in price, it takes tons of research to really spot the good ones.  And many coins stay at just a few pennies for years before suddenly blowing up in value. Bitcoin however is the  coin that everyone knows, it has brand recognition and by far the most adoption. Most people here would tell you not to invest what you can't afford to lose, and diversify your holding. And of course hodl.
Do lots of research before buying anything and good luck, may the crypto be ever in your favor!
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:07:03
I guess we shall see over the next few days. The news came out kind of late for them so I'm guessing there will be some more sell offs tonight when they wake up, plus the weekend is coming up so they will want to dump before then. But I guess time will tell.
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:35:36
It depends, if Chinese investors try to take out all the coins at the same time, the exchanges may not have enough cash on hand to payout and it will be a mess. Could be a series of dips as this progresses. I'd love to say the worst is over but I think it's too soon to tell. I agree that some exchanges will likely open back up shortly after with new regulations in place. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:45:00
No way to tell, they have first mover advantage and name recognition, however plenty of other coins are now more useful and faster. I think it will have top spot for a good long while, but I'm sure several others will get close as crypto becomes more widely adopted. Only time will tell
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:19:55
True, but they have a pretty solid advantage with their platform, and Charlie Lee joining the staff full time has been awesome for them. They have been pretty active about trying to increase their adoption, plus being added to coinbase was huge for them. Everything is still pointing up from what I can see.

@_date: 2017-09-08 17:10:54
Yeah I already read through it, but I feel like there might be some things missing in translation. I'm still not clear if they are stopping all trade or just ICOs, it looks like they were saying it would happen at 17:30. But they did say banning coin exchanges would have no effect on blockchain tech because they are two completely separate things. I disagree with them there however, I think it would have a pretty big effect. Sounds to me like if they really do ban all trading then they are just attempting to destroy the market so they can use blockchain for their own purposes. Or maybe it's an elaborate set up designed to make the whales in the Asian markets insane amounts of money by creating dips they can profit from. Not sure at this point, time will tell.
*edit - after more research the article may in fact just be straight up fake news, sounds like the author is a pretty shady guy. Someone's driving down prices and making a fat profit off this.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:27:03
What I take away from this is at least some of them seem to think China will ban it, but then Russia and Japan are going to ramp up their stake in crypto, so there will be a bear market for awhile if China bans, but it will recover in the long run. They sound pretty unsure though. But all I know is I'm buying like crazy if the ban goes through because it will probably be the cheapest you can get coins for a long Time!
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:39:26
I've had similar problems but it's because of where I live, my state has banned all crypto related activities with any company unless they meet ubsurd regulations and oversight, and the only company to do that so far is coinbase, and they have crazy fees. I cry every time I make a large buy. I tried to get verified and was ignored by every exchange, it wasn't until I tried to use shapeshift that I learned about the regulations that went into effect this year, they had a nice big message on their site letting me know exactly why they were unable to offer their services to me. Unfortunately I'm afraid this will begin to spread to more and more states in the near future as crypto gains popularity. It's just as bad as the China ban, basically killing crypto. If my holdings get high enough I'll have to move just to cash out without crazy legal issues. It really is an issue that's getting worse. I have been mining for a bit and it is pretty unprofitable... But most desktop computers are capable of cpu mining cheap coins, and even though they may only be worth pennies, or even fractions of a penny, if you think long term it may be worth it. You could easily mine 1,000 coins a week and hold them, eventually the difficulty level will go up and price will increase, if you have a few hundred thousand coins and the price goes from $0.001 to $0.10 then I'd say that's a decent profit. It could take months to happen, it could take years. But it is possible. Not the best way to get in the crypto game but if your choices are limited it's worth doing I think. The worst case is your electricity bill is a tad higher, best case you make thousands in profit.

@_date: 2017-09-09 21:41:51
It's true you won't make your money back if bitcoin never increases in value, but if you hold on to the coin and the price skyrockets again... At what point does it become worth It? It seems I keep hearing mining isn't worth it, but does no one factor in the potential price of bitcoin in the future? I've only mined for a bit, and indeed it wasn't profitable with my ill-equipped rig, but with the proper equipment and a lot of patience is it still that inefficient? Honestly curious here about how much the price would have to increase to make .02 a day at all profitable
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:22:30
Well it's down 4% which is worth taking advantage of for sure, this should be the resistance level, much lower and it might be a negative sign... If it stabilizes here then it's just a minor correction.

I disagree, it may be the most used but I don't think it has the most use. Alts are most likely falling due to the upcoming fork, everyone wants to get free coins, I suspect there will be a big pullout of BTC back into alts post fork. Alt coins will continue to grow as adoption spread, BTC is just the gateway.

Nope, hold. The last two exchanges meet with regulators in China tomorrow, if they announce they are closing the price will plunge way further, buy then! If they say they are not closing expect a very quick rise in price then stabilizing. These exchanges are the big ones, it will have a major effect on price. My instinct is saying they will close, so buckle up and brace yourselves. I'm holding and getting ready to buy a lot!
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:13:01
Well from what I understand, the Chinese govt didn't officially close the first exchange, they are shutting down voluntarily because they know a shutdown is coming so they are just getting it over with. The other two are either hesitant to announce or are hoping for a last minute change of heart from the government. But there are plenty of corrupt officials in China, so it could also be part of some sort of insider trading scam, who knows?

@_date: 2017-09-11 01:45:24
Last I read they were POTENTIALLY banning the exchange of ALL crypto to Chinese currency trades, but crypto to crypto trades would be allowed, and owning and using crypto would still be allowed. Of course NOTHING has been officially confirmed yet. There have been some worrying signals from major Chinese exchanges though. We should know soon. Either back to business as usual, or get ready for a major price plunge.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:22:38

That depends on how you interpret the ban, from what I understand it was meant to target ICOs but the terminology was vague so it technically banned all crypto transactions, although I'm assuming China is only planning on enforcing it on ICOs, while hopefully clarifying their stance sooner than later

I'm no math whiz but I think the gist of it is... if it's near payday when OP has money the price will be high, and at the furthest point from pay day when he has no extra money to buy price will be low. Or something like that
@_date: 2019-09-02 02:30:10
Maybe but maybe not. I had put a few thousand dollars into stocks when I was a teenager... I recieved a letter a few years back informing me my assets had been siezed by the govt due to inactivity, when I called to get clarification I was told the company that I had used to purchase the stocks sent me a yearly statement, but since I had moved the letter was returned unopened. Apparently if this happens twice, the govt assumes you are a terrorist sleeper cell and they confiscate your money no questions asked. 
There are ways to try and fight it to get your money back, but this is the govt we're talking about. I nearly had the same thing happen to the first savings account I opened with a local credit union. I had a few hundred bucks in there I forgot about when I left home and my parents recieved a call saying my account would be seized due to inactivity if I didn't respond immediately. I was able to transfer that money and close the account in time, but it just goes to show how willing the govt is to steal our money... as if all these insane taxes aren't enough.
Yet another reason to hold ₿TC in your own private wallet instead of fiat, but also, OP should contact CoinBase directly and verify if this specific instance is a scam or not... never can be too safe.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:41:42
Yep, it's not exactly like you spend $7k on a miner and you're guaranteed to mine a block solo the next day and recup your investment! Plus you have to pay for electricity, plus hardware can and does fail and get outdated and require replacement... this all cuts into profits. And this is assuming you run just one miner... it would not be very profitable at all. You would have to join a pool to even earn anything unless of course you want to start an entire mining farm which increases your cost to do business and you're looking at dropping at least several hundred thousand dollars. 
Basically for the average person, mining with just one ASIC is going to be less profitable than just spending that same money on buying BTC and holding.

I actually had a discussion at work today with someone loudly talking about how much he invests in gold... so I asked him a few simple questions about roi and what kind of profit he expects to make. I then pulled up a 5 year price chart of Gold prices and informed him that the price of gold was actually down half a percent from 5 years ago... I then showed him a 5 year price chart of Bitcoin.
He stammered about how gold has real value and it's price will always go up in the long run, and lectured me about how gold has been a valuable asset for thousands of years.  I just quietly smiled and said okay, let's have this conversation again in another 5 years and see where both of our investments are at.  
I didn't convince him, but a few other people in the room seem to take interest. I still find it amazing how many people don't understand anything about cryptocurrency.

If traditional stocks crash then likely BTC will be affected as well. Each cycle there are more and more institutional investors that will react the same as they would if they were investing in a normal high volatility stock. For them BTC is considered an extremely high risk asset. Most of us here just keep holding since we know in the long run it's the best investment you can make... but to an traditional investor I bet they pull out of all their risky investments as soon as a market crash happens.
Only time will tell, and hopefully you're right... maybe people will see BTC as a safe haven. Either way I'm less worried about Trump's policies than I am with the already tenous circumstances with the Chinese financial market. They bent over backwards trying to keep up growth and it's starting to catch up to them. There are a few enlightening documentaries from a few years ago that show how China was building literally entire cities that no one even lives in just to fuel the construction industry. A lot of people have been saying China is on the verge of a major recession for years now. This started a long time ago and will definitely impact the rest of the world.

Why do people think the entire financial industry has no experts? That's just silly. Of course no one is right 100% of the time and crypto is not the same as traditional stocks but many of the same principles can be applied.

It's not. I've lost a little leaving altcoins on an exchange. But for short term buy or sells it's kinda unavoidable, if it's only on the exchange long enough to complete your transaction you limit your exposure to the risk and you should be fine.  However if you leave your money or crypto on the exchange for a longer length of time then obviously your risk increases.

@_date: 2019-05-31 04:26:40
A lot of experts are calling for a 30% retracement so a dip back to $5k - $6.5k is not out of the question. So do you buy now just in case it doesn't happen... or wait and blow your load all at once if it does retrace? Or buy a little now and buy a little when it dips.  If your plan is long term hold... the dollar cost average is your best bet. The difference won't seem that big as long as you just keep buying through both bear and bull.
