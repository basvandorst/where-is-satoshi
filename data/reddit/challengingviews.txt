Compare that to FIAT.

What bank is that? If I may so ask.

Seems like a website that would have all this data and be easily searchable by country could be a hit.
The banks can have a rating between 0-5, 0 being total crypto-ban and 5 being crypto-friendly.
And it can also have links to announcements or online customer complaints.

It is not about just the code, it's about the community and the change in consciousness. The code is just a manifestation of the change that is taking place inside a lot of us.

In Germany, Deutsche Bank does not accept payments from Bitcoin related businesses like Bitstamp. Other restrictions might also be in place. Boycott Deutsche Bank.
I am in the process of leaving them. It takes some time because my bank credentials are still used for some of my things.

 I am really glad that you like it. Game starts in 2010 and uses real trading data. The users can search for the data anyway. So I puy it directly in the game. There is a limit of 42 trades/moves per year. The goal of the game is to pick the right trades at the right time, not to make all the possible trades. The next 30 days are shown for to help the user. But, to be in the AllTime leaderboard users have to choose wisely.

Have a couple of hard-core gamblers in my family but didn't about gambler's fallacy, had to do a quick search.
Here is what Google said ^((for the lazy among us)):

Hey, thanks for trying the game. A friend of mine suggested a prank withdraw button, and, now that you mention it too I think I will add it at the end :D Should be fun.

Soo...I just added a "Withdraw" button at the end of the game. Thanks for suggesting it.
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:12:17
Just launched it, feedback about the game is very welcomed, thanks :)

This is a healthy and sustainable mindset and I agree :)

Here's a website (r/ that you guys can use to see how much you would have had in a similar situation with the OP's story.
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:48:21
Thank you very much. You rock!
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:03:11
aaa..ok.. Not sure what to say about that..
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:46:54
Yeah, it would have been for some, and it was for a few.

That's was part of the idea, to simply inform others without dragging them to exchanges and charts. Most of the people do not care about market values or trading. But they can probably understand a couple of sentences and a number. :)
 
Of course, for someone like me that knew about Bitcoin for a long time but never got in, this can be quite frustrating, but also a wake-up call.
