I won't continue engaging with you further; your denials are just sinking yourself deeper into a hole.
I have already messaged the admins about this with my proof, and trust that they will take the appropriate action soon.
@_date: 2016-04-12 18:20:20
Nice try, but my account has always been mine.
I can't verify whether BitGild is a scam or not, since I've never used it, but now that I'm on my computer again, I do have proof that you changed your links. This was a screenshot I took an hour ago:   
You can see in the bottom left that hovering over your link goes to "bilcointalk.org" instead of "bitcointalk.org". Furthermore, you seem to own the domain since it no longer goes to a login page, but simply redirects you to the real website, further proving you are simply trying to cover up the fact that you attempted a phishing scam.
By the way, you link users using "not "Edit: furthermore it's easy to tell that you are upvoting this thread with multiple accounts, since it was highly upvoted within a short period of time but lack any comments

Nice try, I saw your links before you edited the post. Every link, all 4 of them, was to "bilcointalk.org", which would lead you to a login page, and then redirect you to the actual forum after you enter in a username/password. 
"Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, three times is enemy action."

Stop trying to cover it up, he's not the only one who noticed your phishing attempt.
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:44:41
It probably would have helped if you didn't try to phish people at the same time, and then edit your links to pretend it never happened when you got called out.
@_date: 2016-04-12 18:47:06
I'm guessing you can use someone's legitimate account with an extensive history to promote a website or another phishing link, which increases the chances that someone will click on it because the user is "trusted". You can also use them for "sockpuppet" accounts, to post positive reviews on a thread or something like that.
I'm just speculating though, although I'm sure there are other uses for a highjacked account.

What if you wanted to buy something that was only 10€? Would 5€ still have sounded reasonable?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't created before BCH came out? Why is BCH so popular there?
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:23:32
So you're saying the subreddit was created for Bitcoin (BTC) initially, but a lot of people who support BCH moved there and that's why it's a BCH subreddit now? That's what I was confused about.

That's what I thought of shortly after I made this post. Thanks.

Let's say I have a wallet that contains 10 BTC. I want to send 1 BTC each to a different person, but I want it to be sent from a different address for each person so they can't look at the sender address and see all the other people I sent money to. (Let's pretend you can't check the sender address to see who sent money to that address)
Is my only option to manually create a new address, send some money to that address, then use the address to send money to the receiver, or is there an automatic way? 
@_date: 2019-01-18 22:25:05
Spend and replace.

Correlation does not imply causation. Does Coinbase have the power to affect Bitcoin that strongly just by adding an altcoin?

That's not Google's or Android's fault with the S4 though. That's Samsung. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 17:27:49
To whoever managed to send me bitcoins while I was sleeping last night, thank you!
Edit: Just checked the transaction on blockchain.info:


0% (Very Poor)
The transaction fee was 0 BTC, so does this mean this could potentially be discarded? It's a pretty big disappointment because it's the first time someone sent me bitcoins :(

You can also download the stock Google keyboard from the Play Store as well. I agree that the one that comes with Samsung by default sucks.

The concept is nice but the site looks really ugly.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:00:24
You should have some easy to see link on your site that actually explains what Bitcoin is all about to new viewers, especially since you're effectively using HB to advertise your site. I just checked out your site and found it a bit cluttered, and most importantly, if I was an average person with no knowledge of Bitcoin, I wouldn't be able to learn what it is.
@_date: 2013-06-07 09:53:26
Thanks for the link! Bitcoins are pretty cool.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:20:56
Check out bitcoins.com which is a new site that attempts to explain Bitcoin to beginners, and also weusecoins.com. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 06:09:42
I'm getting the same issue for your Forum page. Haven't checked out the others.
Apparently this is caused by mixing HTTP and HTTPS protocols on the same page, if that helps.

I'm 18 now and just bought my first Bitcoin yesterday on LocalBitcoins - now time to find something to do with them, haha! I might put some in my Reddit wallet to tip others now that I can finally afford to! 
I'll probably be checking out as well. Oh, and I'm in Vancouver and I hear Bitcoin ATMs will soon be available to use, so that's pretty cool.

So if I withdraw, it has to be the full amount, correct?
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:31:54
You didn't actually send him any bitcoin... the "$2 btc" is incorrect, which will cause the bot to ignore your attempt to tip.
