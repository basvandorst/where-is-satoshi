 for outgoing and can also rebuy it on exchange on-the-fly

With this move you'll support users that exposed themselves and you to highest risk. Users should be confident storing fiat, but cautious with crypto.
Like I'm sure you business clients were. The ones that resell bitcoins that will now need to up the fees to count in extra risk. 
You're supporting risky traders, but bitcoin exchanges are more than about traders. They are also source of coins for lower level sellers (brokers, BTMs, LBC,...).

Also to keep bitcoin balance at minimum one would have to withdraw them after each sale + rebuy.

ATM operators will typically deposit a lot of fiat. This forces stamp to do more AML with them. Local regulations for ATM can be looser (no KYC) than stamp is OK with. This means not account or a discontinued one. At least in my experiences. Maybe things are different for US cos of more regulated market.

There's more to this than being pissed. I can have policies to limit bitcoins exposed on exchange, as I can add in max 2h at anytime and remove instantly. I can't do that with flat. If exchanges start withholding fiat to cover bitcoin hacks, it's bad for industry.

They probably have some coins as they are operating at least partially on stock (as opposed to full real-time restocking). Not uncommon with US ATM operators.

This causes other problems and it's not easy to get business account with some exchanges for ATM operators.

Except if you're the only and first bitcoin wallet for Android in 2011.

10 used BitAccess for 100k CAD? That won't happen. Much better new ATMs can be bought cheaper. Used for less than half this price.

Consider it the same as accepting USD for payment. You need to pay VAT in EUR. You may need to pay tax on gains in value if price increases while you hold coins, but I don't think this would be enforced.

And a simpler approach for evaluating if transaction is relatively safe is using a service that does that. Like:  It will show confidence level for unconfirmed transactions. Above 90-95% usually means next block confirmation.

Yes. It's available globally. And it's anonymous.

Yes. Paysafecard + Skrill + Neteller = 
Biggest e-wallet player.

What are you trying to achieve? There's this, though not sure it it fits your needs: 
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:16:50
1. You need a stack of coins. 
2. You need 2-3 as much in Fiat, deposit it to exchange. 
3. 1 ATM. Used are more affordable. 
4. As you sell some coin, buy it back immediately. Manually or BTM code or use reload.bitnik.eu 
5. As needed empty cash, deposit to bank, deposit to exchange and move coins from exchange to hot Wallet.
Hard to go wrong. Set ATM fees high as there will be costs. Mind the small buys as you pay the mining fees (think 5 EUR buy with 1.5 EUR mining fee). 
The rest is just standard business, whatever that means in Uganda.

I'm out of ideas. You could always import your seed into Mycelium and should find that address available to sign msg with. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:16:43
Do u have 2 BC.info wallets perhaps? 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:06:59
Login to web wallet. Settings &gt; addresses, find the address used &gt; more options &gt; sign message. Put ETH address as message. Sign. 
If you don't know bitcoin address, open transaction details and take one address from the left side. 
Hope it helps.

This weird address is 'change address'. Bitcoins are sent to new address in same (your) wallet. Same wallet holds keys for both (old and new) addresses. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:05:49
Indeed the website is down. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:21:16
Either that, or you had to provide private key to sign the transaction. You can mport it in Mycelium and sign msg there. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:38:47
What do you mean you had to manually import it? You said that this is the 'weird' address. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:36:15
If you ever created 2 blockchain.info wallets where one is watched by the other. And are now trying to sign in wrong wallet. Though from your other answers it's clear this is not the case. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:44:50
Are you sure transaction's input was this address? If it's a watch only address and wallet does not hold the key, it can't spend it. 
Don't put your seed in online address generators/checkers. xpub is used for that and even that's not recommended.
