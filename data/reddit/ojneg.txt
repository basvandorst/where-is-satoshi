I think comparing foreign sovereigns to subjects of our current monetary regime is not quite 1:1.
Otherwise I will just say I hope you are correct.

They couldn't stop people from smoking it, but they sure could cage enough people to deter it from existing in the open. Let's not underestimate the power of the state and its influence upon the market

They can lock him in a cage until he coughs it up though.

This may pan out, or it may be incorrect. The correction could come sooner, or later along his timeline. 
Who cares? People plop money into their 401ks without worrying about the precise stock prices. Apply the same course of action to BTC. The soundness of the investment is what makes you trust your savings in it.

I love it when the elites fight amongst themselves. It's a race to the bottom when it comes to shitcoins

Mass adoption will have to be spurred by an economic crisis where people lose confidence in the dollar and its associated cartel banking system.
Hodling only serves to prepare you for when the time comes. To imply that the purpose of hodling is anything else is to misunderstand the purpose of savings in an economy.

Your economic theory is BS!   
Deflation can only increase the value of the currency. Meanwhile, in an economy, unidirectional time preference (immediate demand to consume) will always counterbalance the desire to save.

Because all human beings have a certain degree of time-preference. That is, the preference for current consumption at the expense of savings. This counterbalances the uncertain promise that their savings might yield greater value in the future.

Because demand for money is ALWAYS counterbalanced by demand for all other goods.

If you don't plan on hodling after they ban it, you might as well not hodl at all
