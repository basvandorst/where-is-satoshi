So you have a $20K boat and...wat?

Wow. That...that might be the worst title for a post on reddit I have ever seen.
OP even tried to correct it in his follow up comment. Let's insert his correction:
"Coinbase needs a TV ad, if it wasn't for them I wouldn't even have any, I'm an idiot, we need idiots to lol."
I guess I can get behind the idea that we "need idiots to lol"...if they don't lol it's...harder to identify them as idiots? Maybe?
Sober up OP :)

Yes. Yes they will.

So the currency is "useless" but if you don't buy it you're"stupid"?

Are you actually surprised?

That is the most incorrect statement I've ever heard. I own multiple bitcoins and I'm rooting for it to go to zero because I'd rather see the ridiculous irrational bubble burst and idiots get their due then save a bit of money on my BTC.

I've seen this story before when the internet bubble burst and all the day traders I knew got destroyed. Same thing is going to happen with BTC.

Because  day traders deserve to get rekt ������

Hell no, I'm partying . This is exactly what bitcoin needs. Watching the day traders panic is almost as entertaining as the Super Bowl ��
