“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with hardly a fraction in reserve.”

If the banks are used for securely storing BTC, then I am all for that. It is just a bit concerning is all. Sounds like it may not be a big deal that WF is looking into Bitcoin. I hope everyone is right about this.

Can someone explain to me why letting banks dip into Bitcoin is a good thing? I understand from a regulatory/AML standpoint (inevitable), but why is this being touted as good news? Once corporations and banks start getting involved, it takes the power away from the people once again. 
Bitcoin is our currency Coup d'état so to speak.. Why would we stand idle and applaud while big banks try to step in?  Maybe I am over exaggerating?

So basically just bitcoin purchases? I wonder why some would worry about splitting deposit amounts under 10k? Must be IRS reporting rules in this case?

I want to take this as good news, but it is hard to do so. Banksters and Brokers are now flooding the market. I am concerned with massive manipulation.
