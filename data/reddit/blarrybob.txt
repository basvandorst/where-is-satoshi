My neighbor sent me this link today. He hates bitcoin, and calls it a ponzi scheme. He's a traditional investor and gold speculator so the idea of it is a joke to him. He's constantly asking me what the price is and as it goes it gets lower he gets happier.
I just think he's pissed he didnt invest in BTC when I did.

Alright... Mind blown. I just spent the last hour watching his cardboard box video. Astonishing! My usual next step when finding true OC is to do my homework and see what the critics are saying. What shocked me here is that this video was downvoted to oblivion on Your secret upvote would be appreciated:

I disagree. He brought some really good information to the table and from a legal prospective no less. Other than citing Liberty Reserve of course!

I've been having trouble explaining how BTC is a currency to friends and family.. turns out it isn't just a currency, security, or store of value. It's all of the above, that's the real take away here. Very well spoken, extraordinary conversation!
