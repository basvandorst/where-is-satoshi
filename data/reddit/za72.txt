You’re describing security in layers, which is the proper implementation of any ‘security’ - and I agree with your message. 
Clearly plain text is an easy flaw in this method. Ages ago Unix’s password file was also in plain text, the idea being that no one would waste computing time to break the passwords. There are still ancient Solaris systems that limit password length to 8 characters even though you can enter in 32+ characters, the authentication system would only honor the first eight, recently OpenSSL was patched to fix a bug even though it’s been implemented by hundreds of hardware vendors, there are network devices which are manufactured with backdoors, are intercepted during shipment to add backdoors, etc... 
My statement is that any sort of security is temporary, you have to keep innovating, implementing triggers at multiple levels, deceive  attacks and funnel damage to honeypots, be creative and stay vigilant and innovate.
Look at how insecure Equifax was and yet so critical to business it is,  security isn’t something that’s achieved, it’s a constant moving target.

Why would you think it's a good idea to put in a prayer? 
What was your thought process...

Do you realize you're not in a vacuum?

Linux is about freedom, Bitcoin is about freedom... FUCK this asshole, Gentoo has a serious PR issue on their hands.

Because you’re only secured temporarily, it’s a war not a battle.
