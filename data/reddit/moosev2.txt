If you trade with your emotions, you'll lose 9 times out of 10.

How big is your yard?

Can you elaborate on this?

I have no idea about the others, but RBC is $1 fee (some accounts have a certain number per month free), and you can send up to $2000 (although on most accounts you have to call the bank to raise that from $1000)

Awwe man, I better not tell you about my 0.98 BTC balance.

This is AWESOME that you want to do this. We need more people like you.
You can use your regular smartphone for this.
I don't have any app recommendations, but the gist is that you'll show your clients a QR code, which they'll scan to send a payment. This is the easiest way.
The next thing you have to realize is that a bitcoin transaction can take several minutes to fully confirm. This may or may not be an issue. Think of it like paying with a cheque. When you receive a cheque, it may or may not bounce. It takes a couple days to confirm that it's valid, but chances are you just trust that enough people are using valid cheques. In the same way, you can sorta skip the confirmation process.
Lastly, remember that BTC prices are constantly fluctuating. You may want to keep your prices in fiat, and then do the conversion at the time of transaction. Many apps will do this automatically for you.
And definitely advertise that you take Bitcoin! Get a BTC sticker for your window, and get some local newspapers to write an article. Maybe even offer a discount for the first while, to encourage people to pay with Bitcoin.
You're one of the first to adopt this, and if I lived near you, you'd definitely win my loyalty. If you need any help, I'm sure there are thousands of people willing to volunteer their resources to get this off the ground.

Notes can be up to 1gb each. So no.

They're a fairly large business (several hundred employees). Just because the guy in charge of front end design likes bitcoin doesn't mean the money guys are on board.

QuickBT.ca is fantastic for small purchases in Canada. You can use any bank that uses interac (most of them) for amounts up to 0.2 BTC

This is exactly how my password system works. Technically, there's a pattern so if someone determined my password on one website, they could figure out the other websites after a bit of thinking. But chances are, if they have my password it's because they stole the entire database, and will just blindly run the list on other websites. It's not worth the 10 minutes figuring out my password when they just got the login for 2000 other people who don't have different passwords.

That's exactly why I'm proposing this. You may not remember, but Humble Bundle used to be called the "Humble Indie Bundle". It provided a way for indie developers with small user bases to reach large numbers of gamers, and for gamers to support the developers and charities.
Right now, you could consider Bitcoin the way that you'd consider an indie game. I want to see Bitcoin grow.

You don't actually NEED confirmations for smaller purchases. You can go into any store and pay with a cheque -- they trust that it's valid.
Now, for a large purchase, they'll probably want to make sure it goes through.

This is true. I put $5 into a wallet on my phone with the intention of buying Starbucks. Why I got to Starbucks (a few days later), it was only worth ~$4.50.
