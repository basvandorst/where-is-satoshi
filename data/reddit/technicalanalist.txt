I'm pretty new to this, but I consider myself tech savy enough to know the risks. I just started a Coinbase wallet that requires two stage verification every time I open the app. It was my understanding that the large theft was at a site with sub par security measures. Is Coinbase secure enough? If not is anywhere?

So with full scale adoption and usage what is a logical target value, both on a conservative realistic scale and then on a best case scenario?

After watching a video left in comments and some reading, if I'm understanding it correctly, verifying transactions requires scanning every transaction ever made in the 11 gigabyte chain. I don't see how that is sustainable if this actually catches on and transaction velocity increases. The more I read about how this works, the more I realize I don't know how it works, and that OP is probably at least partially correct.

I don't think I'm clear on how to actually "download" my coins and save them offline. Is there some kind of primer or manual that lays out some best practices on all this?

Couldn't agree more. Thanks for the post, until now I thought I DID understand the security risk and now after asking some questions I know I don't. I don't claim to know how a debit card works behind the scenes either, but when my identity was stollen earlier this year and Chase called me to verify charges made across the country, you can be sure I was glad that SOMEONE was on the case.
