Satoshi had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. He took me to his cabin and he told me his secret. 'I am not Satoshi Nakamoto' he said. 'My name is Ryan; I inherited the title from the previous Satoshi Nakamoto, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from is not the real Satoshi Nakamoto either. His name was Cummerbund. The real Satoshi has been retired for years and living like a king in Patagonia.'

Log graphs better represent relative changes.  A ten percent move at 1000 appears much bigger than a prior 10 pct move at 100.  
Without log, the older part of the chart can be very hard to read.
