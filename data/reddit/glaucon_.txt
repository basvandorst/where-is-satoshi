Why not use coinbase? But more importantly, what would be a better way to trade bitcoin?

Doesnt the FBI also have a huge hodling in bitcoin from the sacking of the silk road?

This is an awesome clip thank you! It's just weird that the vox isn't synced up with their mouth movements.

I'll wait until my bitcoin will rent a driverless car to commute, thanks. leapfrogging technology is the way to go.

I'm confussed. Uploaded images and shared them, got nothing. Is there a specific place to share in order to get bitcoin??

Who cares if Krugman "believes" in bitcoin. He makes it abundantly clear that he hasn't the understanding.

Just sold my .99998 bitcoin's out of coinbase. Will be looking into other trading avenues.

has anyone actually been paid by supload? All i see are threads on /rsupload about not getting paid. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:18:06
supload will owe me 1400 satoshi's and probably not pay up
