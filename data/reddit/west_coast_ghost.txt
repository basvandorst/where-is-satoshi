flash crash..? you mean pullback into a perfect bullish consolidation? lol

Very cool. Lol, For everyone laughing about the car wash price (I would imagine you are mostly from the US), that's pretty standard price. In Canada, Premium hand car wash and detail at businesses can be over $100 depending on the options you add.. I would imagine the closer you get to Mexico, the cheaper the car wash?
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:31:14
Lol, probably.. but what if the OP was actually talking to a smart young kid and now you just look like a jaded, miserable loser that has nothing valuable to contribute.
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:27:47
Not in Canada.. there is no bill lol

I would honestly buy one if it didn't say 1 BTC on the top right.. I don't really understand why it's there, considering it can hold any amount. Also, do you walk around with a sticker on your credit or debit card that says how much money you have in your account? lol. Not trying to be rude, just constructive ;)

They do use a very similar protocol on the lightning network to do Atomic Swaps ;) edit: it's called a  Hashed Timelock Contracts or HTLCs.

This is the same type of shit that was happening on Quadriga a while before the debacle. They were both owned by WB21 and Crypto Capital Corp... just sayin.

Because I am Canadian, which means it's pretty much useless.

99% of ICO's and Altcoins are a scam. Anyone else who tells you differently is a fool. Maybe some of them actually have good intentions and one day if some of them prove to be legit, but until then...

Lol it happens.. I suppose in theory, virtual real estate exists, they are called domain's ;)

You gotta do a follow up and let us know how you like your new BMW.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:48:39
I am now aware of this! People were pretty quick to add that the whole thing is basically a BMW lol. What's this world coming to!?

Is this just a mobile version of the web of [blockchain.poker]( I found that one about 6 months ago, and it works really slick.

I never made it sound like anything.. it's a joke between car enthusiasts because the new Supra has a BMW engine.

If you could literally walk around 10 houses in a day from your computer vs house hunting, you would choose the VR option, or you just like wasting days or weeks lol.. you could get the exact perspective from all the rooms that pictures can't even remotely do justice. You're an idiot lol.

Oh okay, I suppose that person might has it on a non maximized window, i've only ever used the site on a PC not mobile or shrunken window so I was like I didn't know there was a mobile version lol. Thanks eh.

Do you have a parts list or a build? I'd be interested in making one.

This is another one i've been looking at, it has a full dashboard with OTC market volume access and a few other handy things.

Shakepay. Very fast and easy.

I've done lots of business with them without a problem, so I kinda have a hard time believing they straight up ignored you. There customer service is amazing in all my experience.

I have been an audio engineer for about 10 years, and you folks all have good intentions because I want to hear him better too! But the main problem with Andreas sound is not that he needs a better mic, although a nice Shure lapel mic on an XLR going to a Zoom recorder would be the best option. The main issue is that he is often in an area with high acoustic reverb and early reflections, causing the mic to go in and out of phase. People seem to forget that a microphone records in a pattern and most hear the whole room including your voice. A good sounding recording is 3/4 environment or room noise and 1/4 microphone quality ;)
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:49:16
Sounds good, nice work!

AMFeed is better IMO.

I've never seen a Visa Debit card, just Mastercard, but I know sometimes MC blocks transactions because they think it's fraudulent and you have to confirm that you made the transaction. Other than that, unless VISA is pulling some funny business, TD shouldn't have a problem with crypto purchases. I have personally used BMO forever, they also happen to be Shakepay's custodian so I don't know if that makes a difference but i've never had an issue with BMO and I use it weekly.

You must be a complete idiot. Canada is one of the number one crypto and blockchain adopted countries in the world. This information is widely available with a quick google search.
@_date: 2019-01-06 06:03:13
You say "card issuers there".. are you even Canadian? Second, there is no problems with a lot of the banks here and no "authorities" are stopping it lol. Why is Bitmex allowed in Canada (except quebec), if these Authorities are all over it. When purchasing, some people get denied for other reasons, like their name doesn't match or something is wrong. A lot of people jump the gun and assume that because the bank has denied the transaction for security purpose. You have to phone and tell them to allow the transaction. They did deny purchases on credit cards, and certain exchanges seem to have more problems with banks than others, but for the most part, it's not very difficult to buy BTC or withdraw fiat with a bank in Canada.
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:46:50
The difference is, bitcoin is *your* money, not applying for credit. Credit defeats the purpose of bitcoin.. credit causes inflation and collapse of the dollar. One of the main reasons bitcoin was invented, was to bring our store of value back to reality.
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:23:02
To add to this, most credit card companies charge you a yearly fee to have their card, a bank usually charges about a $15 monthly fee to have a chequing account that gives you unlimited transactions on your debit (in Canada anyways). Like was saying, when you pay for something on a credit card, it's theoretically not paid for 30 days, even though it appears instant to us.
