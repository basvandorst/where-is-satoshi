So on this phishing site, did the URL bar say  and was there a green SSL mark?

Their goal isn't to eradicate ads off the planet, but instead to make ads tolerable. All this started with flashing, blinking and moving ads, and it's now being reduced to static text. I'm fine with ads as long as they are non-intrusive.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:40:39
Can you read?


Does high volume sound qualify as static text? Are the youtube ads whitelisted? The answer to both of those is no. So, what is your deal?
@_date: 2014-11-08 03:50:53
On that site they say:


So they are simply scraping the reddit API, probably.

It's called adwords and is an automated system... No need to get all panicky about it. It's an obvious phishing site, as the SSL certificate is missing and the URL does not even look close to blockchain.info, so anyone who fills in their details should look back to it as an expensive lesson in computer literacy.

awesome, how did you get started with shirtwascash?
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:31:54
Indeed. Which is why I was wondering if this user was just an idiot.
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:07:15
nice! ~~Do you ship internationally, specifically to europe?~~ Nevermind, found the shipping faq on your site. Nice work.

You can! Just send me 2 btc and I'll send you 1 in return.
@_date: 2014-08-10 04:00:20
Yes, but the hacker can hash "/home/" + username and "C:\users\" + username + "\whatever\" etc
It's still a pretty big search space, but I guess it's reasonable if you know what to look for.

There's an API: 
PRAW is just an API wrapper for python that is not affiliated with reddit as far as I can tell. However they do seem to have support for gilding, see:  and

Anyone got a link to the transaction?

That is a very sexy graph. What did you use to make it? Just photoshop or something?
@_date: 2014-06-02 04:35:56
Thank you for this post. You are 100% right, and while I do personally dislike ads and use ABP for most websites (whitelisting the sites I frequently visit and/or wish to support) I will never understand the entitlement of some adblock users so it's good to see there are still some sane people out there.

[Anyone who has a copy of the private_key file can "take over" a hidden service. Since the original author is still around posting on the tor mailing list it is likely they just backed up the private_key.](

You theoretically could with a MITM attack.

I did some more digging, and it seems to be a pretty recent addition actually! It was added 4 days ago, apparently.

It's absolutely fine, it only has a negative reputation because of the way it has been used as a browser plugin in the past.
@_date: 2014-04-01 19:57:19
Nonsense. A MITM caused by a virus changing the DNS servers or otherwise intercepting all trafic and adding a new root certifcate is a very real threat.
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:49:15
Under freeforums.net, obviously. I don't see that being anything other than a disaster.
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:59:21
Wow, die downvotes. Wat een xenophobie hier op reddit.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:55:21
A virus installed on the computer can install a new root certificate.

Regulations are important because of other regulations?

Asking someone what law they are accusing you of violating is making demands? I'd also be worried if I was accused of violating anti-money laundering.

You may think that is the case (and I somewhat agree), but I don't see what that has to do with anything?

Get back to us when you've read all of the law?
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:38:17
Right, but the customers only need to prove their funds are legitimate because... regulations.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:50:52
The bank said the other party is violating the law. This is a serious accusation, and might even be seen as slander. It is completely reasonable to ask for clarification on what law you are violating.
It is quite difficult to not violate a law when you do not know what law it is. It would be fine if they said it violated internal policy, but that is not what was said.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:56:41
An appeal process that may never come because you may not notice you're shadowbanned. It's an awful system.
@_date: 2015-10-18 12:04:54
Right, this. Tails also has "amnesia" where it leaves no traces on the computer used. I really don't see many usecases other than illegal stuff, at least in the western world, but I'm not judging and would love to hear about some of the non-illegal usecases.
@_date: 2015-09-29 13:12:01
Right, and the only reason that is not okay is because... regulations.
@_date: 2015-10-17 20:36:27
Yes, tails use tor to ensure all connections made by the operating system go over tor. You do not need to use tails to use tor, it's just useful if you want to go do illegal shit and leave not a single trace.

Tor is a network protocol to allow anonymous browsing of hidden services (dark web) or the plain web (through exit nodes). They bundle a web browser (Tor Browser) since most people use it for web browsing, but Tor itself will work for any TCP protocol, not just HTTP (the web).
