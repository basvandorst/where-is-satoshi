IMO....I think people’s new magic number is 18 now that they’ve seen it go there and then dropped faster then what they are used to.  I have complete faith today we’ll see a nice climb and if it gets to 18, we’ll see a big sell wall.

Good information is hard to find around here.  It’s been flooded with people that don’t know anything about bitcoin but aren’t afraid to voice their opinion.  “I put $36 in Coinbase 2 days ago and their charging me $14 dollars to withdraw, fuck Coinbase!” would be an example of what I’m talking about.

Me too, except I was lucky enough to get in at the 5800 dip also.  It’s been a great last month for me.  This community has gotten rapidly worse though.

Click sell and choose what account you want to deposit the funds.   Not very long, couple days.
