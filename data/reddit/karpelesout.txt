Hmm. From what I've read before, I believe the devs were aware of it, however it was considered low priority, I'll try to dig out the source for that.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:06:39
It's not at 1500 signatures. It's close. 
I sent the petition to Peter Vessenes when we hit the 500 signatures mark. He replied back stating that he would let me know what the response from the board was. Since then I have been sending him updated versions at milestones, i.e I sent him one when we hit the 1000 point, and will do again tomorrow when it reaches 1500 &amp; hopefully 2000 signatures. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:23:41
I've started this, please all sign: 
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:28:25
Security updates?? What!!?? A couple of peaceful protestors outside. Get a grip Gox!
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:45:55
It would seem so!
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:52:44
Do you not think that it is something that could have been handled in private, even something that could have been worded differently? The phrase "A bug in the bitcoin software" was hardly a sensible move was it? It's not like malleability is a new thing that was just discovered last weekend!
This is why I am calling for the removal of Mark. He lacks the PR &amp; communication skills required for someone in his position. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:11:30
0% However it is a good platform for gathering together the thoughts of people who feel the same before emailing them over for consideration.
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:32:18
Someone in his position shouldn't be distributing "opinion" just facts. If anyone is manipulating the price it's Ne0futur, be it intentional or not.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:32:19
Do you really want someone with such poor PR &amp; communication skills, who evidently cares very little about his customers judging by the fact that he made a concerned customer requesting what is rightfully his stand outside in the snow being visibly present on the Bitcoin Foundation? You can say what you like about the Foundation themselves, but it is them that the press turn to for comment and it is Mark who has caused fear and panic in the markets this week, blaming an issue that has been public knowledge for some time on his companies failings!
Charlie Shrem resigned from his position having brought the Foundation into disrepute. In my opinion Karpeles has done much worse and if he is not willing to resign from the board then he should be removed, or at least it should be considered by other members.
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:33:08
Works OK for me, give it another try now. Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:01:20
Please feel free, I will be doing the same, however as far as I can see, more want agree than disagree.
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:27:23
With almost 1000 signatures, one that has already been acknowledged by The Bitcoin Foundation? 
What are you doing to help the situation?
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:28:49
I'm seriously looking at the price of a flight to Tokyo from London right now.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:15:50
That is my intention. Karpeles has been given a soap box to stand on and release incorrect information and the press are lapping it up, giving him more and more opportunities to be some kind of spokesman for Bitcoin. If he was removed, or resigns the press may begin to understand that a large percentage of what comes out of the man's mouth is lies!
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:36:27
Join the protestors! What else would I be suggesting!?? Violence against Mark would be hypocritical, I want him removed as he's bad for Bitcoin's reputation making it look unprofessional, in attacking him anyone would be doing exactly the same. Besides, he's a big lad, one jab from him and I'd be out for the count!
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:06:59
We've now hit the 400 mark. Thanks to everyone :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:28:04
Anyone want to chuck in a few satoshi each for me to go to Tokyo and put it in his mail box and cause another security alert?
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:56:17
He needs to be held accountable for his actions, today, even after being "torn apart" by the community he's again opened his mouth and caused problems! 
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:33:51
I've created a petition to send to The Bitcoin Foundation asking for Mark to be removed:
He is clearly incompetent and should not be in a visible position on the Foundation site. Yes, we all know the foundation means nothing, but the press look to it for comment on matters and the association with Karpeles is going to ruin Bitcoin's reputation in the long run.
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:20:15
Do you have a link please?
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:56:42
Thanks, I am aware of the news, however it is the PR and attitude that means i have so many concerns about Mark. 
Someone with such poor communication skills should not be associated with the Foundation, which though very little do respect within the community, is often the first port of call for press when they require comment. 
Thanks,

Japanese, Bitcoin exchange.. I'm out!
@_date: 2014-02-19 10:46:07
I'm not begging, as mentioned in the petition, a couple of people asked to send donations, I replied letting them informed them know that there was no need as it didn't need any funding as was all free to set up, however some asked about buying me a beer, If you are that offended by it simply referenced below my name I'll remove it. Are people that have their address in their signature on Bitcoin talk also begging? Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:38:06
Artie Lange and Chevvy Chase as an older Mark looking back on his life. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:02:09
Thanks and don't worry I wasn't offended by you letting me know, I admit my spelling is very poor and am grateful of you pointing it out. :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:55:32
Tried to post it through the Gox post box but it was full of legal letters and dog shit.
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:28:12
Why not say that then? Surely you must realise how people are going to interpret a message like that? 
Everyone at Gox could all do with some serious PR/ communications training. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 11:01:08
Always has done since Karp bought it, nothing new here.
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:35:22
Hence the term "backdoor"
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:01:11
Thanks for the heads up, I am dyslexic so probably not the best person to stand up and say something in writing., but felt I needed to do something. It is Mark's attitude, behaviour and poor PR and communication that makes me think he should be removed. How can Bitcoin be taken seriously when respected members are behaving in this way?
Sent you some gold for pointing out my mistake, Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:44:00
Sent. Thanks Andreas, lovely gesture!
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:06:05
Sorry, as i mentioned in another comment below, I am dyslexic and admittedly did upload this in a rush after watching the protest video and being outraged by Mark's behaviour. 
Would you like to help me put together a more thought out case? I would appreciate any help here. Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:52:01
His days on the Foundation are numbered: 
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:11:34
Thanks to everyone who signed the petition. Really pleased with the result today.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:02:04
I am sure we could have a whip round to have him and Gox removed from the site. Depending on the cost I would happily refund him myself.
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:26:04
He added an extra 1 million in as he knew Mark would lose any that he had earned.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:46:19
Someone should really call the local police/ sheriff and alert them to this. I feel sorry for this guy who is clearly unwell:

Confirmed: 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:55:08
Sadly not, if you look up the address, there is a Nakamoto living there.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:33:55
The response today has been overwhelming, thanks to everyone who has signed! 
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:39:02
I hope not. Violence is not the answer in this situation and would just make us look as bad as Mark. If he is guilty of a crime then let the law deal with him. Regardless of the outcome, I expect he'll be punished in some way shape or form for the past few weeks, be it spending time behind bars, or Mt Gox simply losing it's market share, with his name sullied to the degree that he'll never be associated with a business ever again.
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:24:05
Almost at 1000 signatures now: 
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:59:05
Thanks to everyone who has signed so far. It is looking likely that we will hit our target of 500 signatures by Monday.
A couple of people have messaged me asking for my wallet address. There has been no cost for running this petition and all marketing has been done organically via Reddit and forums so there isn't really a need for donations, however if people do want to send a few Satoshi for a beer, the address is 17YR9FvAujqu86HhuFvjPhbWnKxXfnrPkq
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:44:34
Misleading Title!! Mt Gox have filed for bankruptcy protection, please correct your Title. There is a very big difference:
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:57:57
What's wrong with my communication? Aside from my shoddy English/spelling. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:27:54
There are already calls for this:
sign the petition and lets make it happen!
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:47:45
Thanks to everyone who has signed the petition so far. We have now collected 100 signatures. My aim is to send this to the Foundation for their consideration when we reach the 500 mark.
Please keep sharing this with your friends, on here and on any Bitcoin/ crpyto forums. 
I love Bitcoin and believe in it's long term future, however it is clear to me that these "bad eggs" need to be removed before we really do see the protocol reaching the mainstream. 
With everyone working together we can make the first steps to removing one of the worst offenders!
Mark, if you're reading this, please take the criticism on board and try and learn something from the situation. Charlie Shrem was dignified enough to resign from his position and I think you should do the same
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:33:54
So he paid an accountant but missing money was never raised/ rectified!?
