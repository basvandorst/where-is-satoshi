Heart of a lion bro as zlatan would say “a lion doesn’t compare themselves with sheeps” 
Buy the fucking dip and enjoy the ride. If it goes bust we had a good ride

With this latest dip it got me thinking of the people who lost when it come to bitcoin or any crypto for that matter, I think there should be a support section for people who might be in a bad place right now mentally (although if your not mentally strong I would say crypto might not be for you right now) would love to see something like that on here. I see a strong community with a lot of intelligent people and although where all in this for our own financial gain (and families long term gain), we as the “little guys” should stick together and help one another when the seas are rough, after all it’s us against the whales

100% agree, no investment is full proof looking at it any other way is madness but there’s people who invested at ath and was forced to sell at a later date for much less for one reason or another, I mean I’ve taken losses before but that’s got to be crushing. 
I think bitcoin investments have real potential but it is a gamble and in no way a safe investment unless you picked up in the early days, knowing when to jump in the market and when to hop out is a difficult skill to master and so it goes back to the original saying: invest what you can afford to lose. 
It would be a beautiful day if/when we moon and I hope to be on that first ship but apart of me wonders what happens with the people still on earth.

Personally I take out my initial investment with a little profit and treat my family to a long vacation somewhere we’ve never been. The rest? HODL

Does anyone know anything about longforecast.com and bitcoin? A couple months ago they was predicting bitcoin to moon but now there predictions are a little short of expectation, I was wondering how they make there predictions and has anyone followed this site for more than a couple months, if so has their predictions been accurate
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:16:12
Thats exactly the answer I was trying to find. Now a prediction that changes drastically throughout the course leads me to more questions than answers, I actually took a screen shot of the first time my friend showed me the website (2 months ago) compared to now and it’s completely different and they try to predict things 2-3 years into the future which is completely unrealistic and impossible. Try predicting the figure it will be at in 15 minutes then the realisation of people trying to predict things 2-3 years from now seems laughable. 
But your right there is no test or calculations that are true, these predictions change like the weather (especially with that website) eventually they will be right but how many wrongs came before is the interesting thing.

I appreciate the reply and completely agree but that doesn’t answer my question; what are their predictions based on and have they ever been correct (or as close to)... like you said no one knows how the future will play out so taking predictions on the internet as gospel isn’t exactly the most intelligent thing to do but regardless I’m curious about their methods, calculations and success rate

So your suggesting they take a random number, place it next to a month and boom you got your “predictions”... I can’t say your wrong (I actually believe this to be the truth with a fair few “predictors”) but it’s definitely a dumb tactic, surely if every month is completely wrong their revenue from ads will go down when no one checks their site any more.
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:49:50
So it’s 2020, you wake up knowing bitcoins been relatively stable but you check the price anyway, boom it’s 50k per coin; how do you react and what do you do?
