I can see three scenarios:
1.Mark is under some manner of coercion/gag order and is the fall guy.
2.Mark is an incompetent sociopath who fails to see the scope of the problem he has caused.
3.Mark is actively criminal and has stolen some of the missing bitcoins.
Regarding which I would observe:
1.I can see that the US government/three letter agencies can do pretty much what they want, but how exactly can they coerce a foreign national running a company in an overseas jurisdiction?  And why would anyone put up with it?   Mark should upload any emails/records of communication and invite them to do their worst.
2.There is a lot of evidence for scenario 2.  I don't know if any of us can yet see the scope of the damage to the bitcoin experiment that this has caused.  The lid has been put on it for 18 months now, maybe long enough to kill it or emasculate it.
3.Some evidence for scenario 3 too, sorry to say.

The FT is not doing itself any favours by having Izabella Kaminska covering bitcoin. 
Maybe for a lightweight Alphaville coverage, but it is time they looked for someone more serious.
From her biography page on ft.com: 
"Everything she knows about economics stems from a childhood fascination with ancient economies, specifically the agrarian land reforms of the early Roman republic and the coinage and price stability reforms of late Roman emperors"

We could argue about whether Economics is a science or not, but the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is a prestigious award.
The Economic Sciences Prize Committee sends confidential forms to persons who are competent and qualified to nominate:
1. Swedish and foreign members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences;
2. Members of the Prize Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel;
3. Persons who have been awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel;
4. Permanent professors in relevant subjects at the universities and colleges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway;
5. Holders of corresponding chairs in at least six universities or colleges, selected for the relevant year by the Academy of Sciences with a view to ensuring the appropriate distribution between different countries and their seats of learning; and
6. Other scientists from whom the Academy may see fit to invite proposals.

In general the question on "legal" and "not legal" is verry muddy when it comes to medicines.  There are so many vested interests - drug companies, doctors, Royal Colleges, governments, that it is clear that patient safety, choice and efficacy are very low on the list.  For example, if you want or need some nootropics will you get them just by asking?  Or will the doctor look them up in the BNF (in the UK), decide that you don't have the required condition and send you away?  Really, the doctor should ask why you want the drugs, whether there is some underlying or unspoken need, they should engage with making sure you get in-date and unadulterated drugs, that your use is monitored for adverse reactions and that there is a follow-up mechanism to see how you are doing on the drugs and to help you transition off them if you need to.  An anonymous marketplace might allow doctors to do this, but any doctor (in the UK) is already able to use their initiative and judgement but generally don't.

In this case its not about the business doing it to make money, it's that the artists on Bandcamp are looking for, if not micropayments then at least minipayments. Also, some of their target demographic wll be too young to have a bank card but could have the wherewithal to acquire some bitcoin.
