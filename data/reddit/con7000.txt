There are individuals selling BTC on the spot at random places at the streets for lower prices than that of the exchanges. Once that becomes the norm the price will either fall dramatically because of competition or it will skyrocket because of black market economics. We are currently experiencing the beginning of the first and we will then move to the second conclusion once China begins the hoarding (i guess after the Chinese new year).

My guy saw the number "2" but 2bn is a very small amount. So i guess its 20.

This sounds so bad and people just dont talk about it. 
So is the bitcoin core software successful so far in defending against the 2x nodes?
