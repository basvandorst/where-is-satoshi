You mention 2 assumptions, we I believe are wrong.
1. Double spend attackers are kicked from the network. Wrong: the network doesn't care. All transactions and blocks on the main chain (longest chain supported by 51%) are valid.
2. It's prohibitively extensive to launch a 51% attack. This may be true for an outsider. However, if you are running a profitable mining business, the extra income from the occasional double spend just increases your profits and will not necessarily kill bitcoin.
The 51% attack is serious.

Sort of. ETFs are portfolios of assets. What those assets are depends on the prospectus, not on the name if the ETF. And many details depend on the jurisdiction.
Often those assets are other securities and ETFs can hold swaps or IOUs, i.e. pieces of papers saying that someone will pay 1BTC.
To answer your question: yes, they're baked by assets, but not necessarily by bitcoin. Read the prospectus.

There's no practical way to predict the minimum fee required by the network for the tx to propagate/confirm. Depends on the number and age of inputs. They made sure the transaction will be confirmed and charged you a reasonable mutually agreed upon fee.

University, research, paper, ... Are you sure you know what these words mean?
I'm probably older than you, not wiser though. Let me tell you something. Not all information exists in the form of video documentaries. A long time ago, before YouTube, even before MySpace (your grandma's social network), people used to write down stuff in prose. That's like da shit u write in Whatsapp, but with grammar and shit. It used to be difficult to read from a TV when they were all SD (think Pebble smart watch display, but less clear and flickering), so people used books. Technological advanced people like NS used computers (like an iPad married to a typewriter) and websites (like Apps, but not so intuitive with loads of text and buttons). Search the ancient archives (Wikis) for knowledge of our elders.

Technically correct. However VM can make your setup more secure.
For OP, I'd suggest a reasonably secure host system and 2 VMs, can be Win or Linux. The host only runs trusted essential software. VMsecure is used exclusively for online banking and bitcoin wallets. VMcausual is used for web browsing, downloading and trying out stuff (including bitcoin related stuff you want to test drive)
If VMcausual is compromised, host and VMsecure are safe. If the host is compromised, chances are a less sophisticated attacker misses to look into the VM...

Alice has 10 dollars. Bob has 2 dollars. 
Bob to Alice: Can I borrow 10 Dollars, I'll pay back 11 next week.
Alice: Sure.
Bob buys 100 chocolate bars for 10 dollars.
Alice observes that the price of chocolate bars is falling. Now Bob's bars are worth only 9 dollars.
Alice to Bob: Are you crazy? I want my dollars back. NOW!
Thus, Bob is forced to sell chocolate bars and pay 11 dollars to Alice. Alice's little sister did similar deals with other people. They all are forced to sell, driving the price down. Now more and Alices are getting nervous....

Yes, this sounds like a idea, but I'm constantly surprised how people who want to innovate with computers underestimate computers. Next time you are near a computer, run
     time find . -exec sha256sum
Publishing an app that relies on your idea without a strong password and hash function (beyond sha256) is misleading at best. Malware will detect the app, see which files are open (trivial on some platforms, not sure whether counter-measures against this "attack" exist.)
/pesimist mode
With nasty Malware on your computer, no method of storing, generating or using a private key is secure. Nevertheless, we rely on passwords, keys, certificates every day and most are not compromised by malware. If you follow cold storage best practices to the degree possible, the cat-image-key is not worse than others' people's "secure keys".

This is possibly the worst time to ask this question. If you are confused, please check again in 6 month when the current turmoil is resolved.
A year ago, everyone here and elsewhere would have confirmed that zero confirmations are perfectly save for your use case and, in fact, most use cases. You can probably find this in archived websites.
This risk assessment is based on a feature of the current version of the bitcoin software. We ignore double spent attacks effectively. This feature, however, is not enforced by the consensus rules.
Some people want to change this.  Those people include the mods of this sub. Others,  e.g. most places in want to keep Bitcoin safe for zero conf.
