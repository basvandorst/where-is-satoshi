Are you implying that you believe yourself to be smarter than Satoshi?

Nice try, wannabe kidnapper.

Awesome to hear that GHashCoin is getting wider acceptance.

PS: ALL YOUR BITCOIN ARE BELONG TO ME!

There's no need for this.
Just make your payment with PayGHash: it's easy, fast and safe.

Hahaha, you fools!
Of course they keep customer funds secure!
That way, when they decide to disappear with the money, they will be able to take all of it away!

This is the end.
The malicious masterminds behind the den of evil known as GHash are at this very moment starting their drainage of fiat from the exchanges with their multiply spent Bitcoins.
As supply skyrockets due to the ghash given-and-taken-back coins, prices will soon drop drastically, and will go to zero once the public realizes what is happening and runs away from the flawed pseudo-currency of Bitcoin.
**SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**

**They ran with the money!!!**
**SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:05:54
No, it is the truth and it is **REALLY SCARY**!
Panic runs high among Bitcoin holders, and everyone is rushing to sell everything as fast as possible, and save as much as they can.
Don't be the last guy holding the bag: **SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**

The reckless and criminal behavior of Mt.Gox. is finally exposed, and it is clear how rampant was the disregard for the hard earned wealth of its users, and how they lived large off the stolen savings of families who trusted them with the proceeds of all their life's work.
As this information is spread, everyone will realize how they foolishly relied on a system that turned out to be an hotbed of thieves and profiteers.
Price will rapidly crater to zero, and BitCoin and cryptocurrencies will be consigned to be merely a footnote in history books.
Hence, take **IMMEDIATE** action: **SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**

However, mining for them means you won't be able to share in the loot that GHash.io is starting to plunder from all Bitcoin exchanges and services, and will be the one left holding the worthless coins at the end.
