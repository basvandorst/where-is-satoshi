Would you happen to know if I need to have the account in my name? Currently the chase bank account is in my wife’s name...I just need to go up there and add it, but they close by the time I get off work. But if it’ll work without me being on the account then I don’t have to! Lol

How to buy btc with chase in US? 
I can’t get cash app to work at all (the famous this transfer failed error). I was wondering if I can link my chase account to Coinbase and deposit USD into Coinbase then use those funds to buy the btc? I am new so please don’t beat me up! ��

Not sure if this question goes here...are the auction sites, like eBay, where one can sell legit goods and bitcoin being a payment option? I have a bunch of old comic books I’d like to sell and it would be a great way to earn some bitcoin!

So I am a newbie. I only want to use btc as currency. I am not looking to mine or invest.  So, I set up a coinbase account awhile ago and using electrum as my secondary wallet.  Problem is, my bank is a small credit union and it blocks overseas purchases unless I specifically call and open up my card (I'm in USA). It's a nice security feature, but one that aggravates me on occasion. The coin exchanges I have encountered all seem to be in foreign countries.
Are there US exchanges that my bank is less likely to block until I call?  I saw Gemini might be an option but I'm having trouble finding their location.

Thanks. I tried BRD last night but didn't work. I'll try another.
