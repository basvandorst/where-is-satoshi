Because the number displayed on the coinbase charts is a number between the buy and the sell value. It's on their faq.

Download a wallet that lets you put your key in and you can check how much bitcoin you have and how much of your local currency it is worth.
Note: That key controls the bitcoin transactions signed/sent to it don't give it out.

So after seeing this thread I read up and watched the talk on the lightning network website. It's really cool and neat.
However there's one thought I had that I don't really know the answer to: The point of transaction fees is that they pay off miners for securing the network and slowly replace the coinbase reward. However the lightning network makes it so that those transaction fees happen extremely rarely since most transactions happen off chain. Wont this lead to way less miners because there's no money in it, then you have a problem of not enough power put into securing the network? (of course this would be far into the future where there is no coinbase reward).
Edit: Thinking about it some I guess in an extreme scenario the difficulty would be very reduce if power left the network. Making it easy for small miners to get small rewards etc.

Nodes can set transaction fees they'd like to prioritize, and wallets calculate what they think they should pay/people set it manually. So once the fee becomes to expensive the fee should lower in response as part of the market.
