That all depends on how long you can HODL. It will probably drop to $6k soon. It might drop to $3k again. But in the long run it’s going up.

No, that means you're in a bubble. You want to sell then. Buy when no one cares.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:03:56
Let them keep saying "crash." I will happily buy their panic sells.

There has been substantial inflation since the press opened up in 2008. Just not inflation they will admit. Food prices in particular have gone up substantially. As have medical, education, energy, etc.
But TVs are cheap!
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:03:27
But I like the volatility. It gives me regular opportunities to buy more.

I can’t figure out how he can say bitcoin isn’t backed by anything and then claim the US Dollar is...

Sorry, "thinking person" here and I agree that tax is theft. We no longer have a representative government and taxes are rarely put toward the infrastructures they are captured within (ie. gas taxes toward roads, not redirected into child care or drug programs).

You'd have to have surplus cash to invest first.
Inflation affects lower income people the most since they live paycheck to paycheck and can't save up a couple hundred grand to invest in S&amp;P funds.

More money than anyone could want!

Present what wallet?

Fun experiment. Do a screen cap of your favorite ten day forecast for ten days. Compare them against each other and see how they change each day. It’s especially fun if the weather changes.

They can only prosecute the crimes for which they have evidence. Suspicion of crime is not sufficient.
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:34:23
Hope so. I have buy orders waiting.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:28:21
Are you panicking now? Let me know when you are panic selling. That's when I want to buy.
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:43:08
Buy into the fear, sell into the greed. Nobody got rich buying the all time high.
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:44:46
Thanks, I'll check it out.
I am wondering however, if everyone is going to increase fees in the long term and these low maker fees are just loss-leaders to build the market.
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:38:53
So nice of them to call it a "small increase" when it's only a bit over a 200% increase. I need to find a new exchange so I can close my coinbase account and send them the only message they'll listen to.

How long ago was bitcoin $0.80USD? April 2011.

In 1934 they closed the banks to announce confiscation. When the banks reopened, you were allowed to open your safe deposit box under supervision of a tax agent who would then confiscate your gold. 
People who kept hold at home could not spend it for generations. 
Compliance isn’t optional.

The sooner the treasury authorizes banks to do leveraged bitcoin ETF sales, the sooner they undermine the perceived value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:16:22
I buy all the dips.

If Tesla was willing to take the gamble, why wouldn't Tesla just buy a bitcoin today and not worry about selling the truck tomorrow?
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:48:14
Why not just buy a Bitcoin now and keep Tesla out of it?
@_date: 2019-12-07 05:16:38
This smells more like qualifying for expat tax relief.

We once made a road trip bingo board and included “car fire” as one of the squares. Took about 1000 miles, but we saw one the first day.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:46:26
Genius, this guy.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:44:56
How do you know?
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:12:49
Sweet. I love when it goes on clearance sale.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:30:42
Too volatile, imagine $1000 per BTC instead.

What ambassadorship did you receive?
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:35:34
Safe deposit boxes were locked until opened in the presence of Federal inspectors who would catalog any gold therein.
The only way to not comply was to keep your gold at home, in advance of the order, and hide it. It was no longer usable as currency except on the black market. If you were a jeweler, you could work it into your product, but otherwise you were holding an illicit good with no way to use or sell it.
But yea, I imagine there was some non-compliance. Americans disrespect of authority by tradition.

@_date: 2018-04-05 18:29:36
It was exactly like it was stolen. People wanted gold because they no longer trusted the dollar. Government forced them to give up gold under penalty of arrest / imprisonment / death in exchange for pieces of paper. How is that not [robbery](
@_date: 2019-05-21 03:50:02
And yet the other day someone was crying poor to me about not having $200 to participate in the well guarded secret.
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:25:15
The dollar has been self destructing, as designed. It’s just a very long slow boil. 
This is why assets are the investment choice of the wealthy. Anyone that keeps their wealth in the dollar is at the mercy of inflation.
@_date: 2019-05-21 03:46:43
Sure, but that doesn’t make what is good for the country also good for the individual. Countries would be perfectly happy if their citizens worked and spent themselves into an early grave. Individuals would like to retire in a bit of comfort.  As a result, individuals are motivated to avoid their country’s attempts to destroy their savings.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:09:08
No, I'm saying it's not a well guarded secret, but people find all sorts of reasons to not follow the path to wealth like it's some impossible thing.
@_date: 2019-05-21 03:43:31
Only when you count on new entrants to pay off old debtors... and run out of the former.
@_date: 2016-07-29 05:09:28
Wrong. People looking to buy a home near their job are trying to pay some amount that reflects their income. They can only bid prices up so high before folding.
People looking to export millions of ill-gotten-gains don't care about income vs. house. They are laundering their money. The more they pay per transaction, the better!
