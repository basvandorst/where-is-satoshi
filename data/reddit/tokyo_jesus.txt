Sure, everybody knows it's you, but nobody can say anything about *where* you are.

The problem isn't trading using BTC, the problem is doing all of that on the public ledger. If you aren't held back by the network, you can trade in BTC just as fast as anything else.

There is no way Bitcoin will ever match the transaction volume required by something like NASDAQ. They do millions of trades per second with &lt;1ms latency for most actions.
If Bitcoin *does* catch on, I would imagine NASDAQ et al would settle at the end of the day with a few large transactions on the public ledger.

Latency and transaction volume are two reasons.
Transaction volume is fixable to some degree, but latency is not. Due to its design (a global p2p network), Bitcoin will never be able to match any trading floor on latency:
For a transaction to happen on the Bitcoin network it has to propagate *across the entire planet*. That means that the latency floor (minimum transaction time) is the time it takes light to travel from you to the other side of the planet, plus network delays, plus processing delays, mining time, &amp;c.
In contrast, NASDAQ can complete trades in &lt;1ms.
Bitcoin is really cool, but there are limitations imposed on it simply because of what it is.

You don't have to buy entire coins!
Obviously, early adopters are going to make a lot of money if Bitcoin ever really catches on, but they are so easy to subdivide that it won't really matter for everyone else who uses it. Even with fiat currencies, the fact that my bank account represents less than 1% of the value controlled by anyone in the top 2% doesn't make my money any less useful.
I don't like the uneven distribution of coins, but I don't think it has any bearing on their utility.

Make that $24.

When I say "Information wants to be free", I'm talking about abstract freedom, not cost. Obviously, if you have a piece of information first you are in a position to capitalize on it (and it might be expensive and difficult to get there), but holding onto it is very hard.
I think it makes more sense to embrace that tendency than to fight it. Free/Open licensing makes it so you can determine the conditions of liberation upfront and avoid the expense of keeping things under wraps.

You have obviously never been to kindergarten. Ever heard of sharing? Or Free Software? Open Source, maybe?
Information wants to be free.

I realize that, but in my opinion there is more to gain from cooperation and community than you lose by not making your shit freely available.
There are plenty of examples of companies that make money off of open source software.

Why are you so afraid of freedom?

Why do you need to buy whole coins? You can always buy/sell/spend fractions of Bitcoin. μBTC is a much more useful unit of value, IMO.

Cars aren't money. You don't spend in whole dollars, we have cents to keep track of smaller units of money. The same applies to Bitcoin, except we go all the way down to microBTC.
