I first went to Revive last week hoping to spend bitcoins and unfortunately they couldn't get their old iPhone to turn on :( Had to pay with ol' USD.
But after I was able to buy ice cream for me and my dad at Sweetie Fry :) 'Twas my first 'in-store' purchase with bitcoins and the guy working behind the counter said they get about 7 purchases with Bitcoin per week. Oh and their ice cream is REALLY good!

While we're at it could we establish a symbol for bits as well?

I'm an Uber driver that has a sign up with a bitcoin barcode for tips. (Pic 
I agree with the sentiment in this thread that this is presented as if tips are expected, which is against Uber's policy and in my opinion counter-productive. However what happens when I drive for Uber is people occasionally will give me tips in cash, while it's certainly appreciated it's not expected and from my understanding it's not against the Uber Partner agreement to accept tips offered by passengers. This inspired me to offer an option to let passengers tip in bitcoin. I found a practical use case for someone to give me tips without the safety issues involved with carrying cash. The coins go to an address in cold storage so I'm not carrying coins received in a hot wallet on me.
I've had this sign up for a couple months and wasn't expecting that many people to even know what bitcoin is, so I figured at best it would be used as an icebreaker and conversation starter to share what I've learned about the technology if anyone was curious. Just a couple days ago I got my first tip ($1) from someone who actually had BTC on them so that was pretty awesome...

Actually I'm just wanting for one address in this case, so maybe blockchain.info will work.

Pretty decent I must say...

So how do we know that Satoshi has ~1,000,000 BTC? Can we see at which addresses all the coins are stored at? 
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:38:47
That's absurd.
