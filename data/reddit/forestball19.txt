Let's assume you asked this 3 years ago. In January. And the answers made you go for it. In 2016, the BTC price ranged from $ 400 to 950.
Throughout the year, you'd have bought 12 x 10 = $ 120 worth of BTC minus fees. Let's say $ 108 after fees to allow $ 1 for each transaction.
If the average was $ 800 throughout the year, you'd have around 1/8 BTC or 0.125 BTC.
Today, the BTC is at $ 8,500 - and thus your 0.125 BTC (that you paid $ 120 for) would be worth $ 1062,50.
Now, in 3 years time from now - let's assume you remember having once been interested in Bitcoin and you find this post you made and you do the math again. How annoyed will you be that you didn't do it?
I literally sat with my credit card ready in 2010, ready to buy some Bitcoins when it was at $ 0.04. I considered buying for a mere $ 20. Then thought "nah, fuck it, I might as well burn those $ 20" and I decided against doing it. Imagine if I'd spent the damn $ 20 on bitcoin back then (and not those 500 bitcoins until 2017's ATH at $ 20,000). I realize there's a lot of 2 in my numbers here. Regardless, my point isn't whether you believe me or not - but rather, that you understand that waiting may end up in huge regret.

It's sarcasm. What usually happens is that Bitcoin rises in value, and then the news media pick up - and then people buy. Which means that people who enters after the the news media have covered the Bitcoin price surge, will buy at "all time high". Which is, of course, never recommended, as there will be a correction/backtracing after a period with wild gains.
Seasoned traders knows how to balance this understanding with "fear of heights". So they sell as close to the top as possible, and then they wait for the correction and then they reinvest when the price has fallen enough.

It's a fine time, yes. BTC is highly expected to break through $ 9,000 at any given moment; and $ 10,000 during the summer. The current rate is $ 8,500 - 8,550. Which means that within the next 3 months, you could easily gain 20-25%.
But nothing is a given and nothing is guaranteed. It can go the other way, although current volumes and price trend points strongly towards a bullish market (meaning that BTC value is in a period of rising).
And remember, when askin about price, time and strategy: You'll find plenty of opinions and very little in terms of technical arguments - and nothing in terms of guarantees. 
Do your own research as far and extensive as you can manage - and you'll have a much better understanding of what Bitcoin is, how its price has developed in the past and what we may see in the future.

It seems like a bot network has voted “no”. The “yes”-side was far ahead for hours, but around 4-5 hours ago, the “no” took a huge leap.

But if their country becomes the next Venezuela, they’ll care. 
But it’s only when things go to shit that people tend to wonder if living by the “if it works, don’t fix it” was a stupid thing to do.

Coins that follow the value of the US Dollar; such as USDT (Tether), TUSD, GUSD etc. - They are currency backed. Tether are facing problem now, though, but that's a beehive in itself.
