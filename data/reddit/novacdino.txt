The joke was just that it was a knock-off, the Chinese Centralization part was simply implying a Chinese monopoly over the currency as they are the biggest miners, and with the bigger block sizes, they would essentially own the currency but maybe I got that wrong. I have simply been reading some of the criticisms on this subreddit about BCH getting centralized because of the block sizes

As uses for the btc chain skyrockets over the next 5 years in a tremendous number of fields, bch won’t be able to compete, but as far as a currency, I don’t think you can ever really kill it. The biggest chance of killing it is probably to make Roger Ver the universal spokesman for it

I fully agree with you. I am not looking to alienate the Chinese, in fact from what I have experienced with Chinese people, They would Never get discouraged from buying into Bitcoin or bitcoin cash due to us talking about the Centralisation of Bitcoin Cash from Chinese mining. They simply wouldn’t care. If the Chinese want to dominate the crypto market, they will do so with ease. I don’t think they care in the least what we are discussing on reddit. Never the less, I can see why you make such a comment. I was simply pointing out the hilarity of the BCH logo being the same logo as Bitcoin except tilted to the left. It’s the equivalency of have Nike shoes and Kine shoes. They just flip the letters haha.

I understand that, I am for free market too, and I hope these people won't be able to slow down crypto with regulations. So far, bitcoins free market has been able to withstand centralized control
@_date: 2018-10-28 13:24:26
Didn't this guy remove regulation with the net neutrality thing, shouldn't bitcoin folk be for that? 
@_date: 2018-10-28 14:02:00
Didn't say I did, hence the question mark. But it seemed to me that they removed regulations, giving big corporations the ability to misuse their power.

Use a gotenna, a small antenna for your phone to send Bitcoin

I have a bunch of Words that I have written down. Do you mean that I can use those words with a different wallet service to get my Coins if GreenAddress shuts down? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:52:35
I dont know, I created my wallet and all I need to sign in is my Pin. GreenAddress uses a Chrome extension, I have not seen any private key (I am new to this so don´t make fun of me please) The only key I have seen is my "address" and it keeps changing whenever I click on it

Yes, but the keys are stored on a separate hard drive that is fully encrypted and can only be accessed by Samsungs application and no other
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:19:47
You can build a wallet that can push money monthy with your permission as long as the wallet stores your keys 
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:17:55
There is nothing wrong with a "hot wallet" nobody should have 1 singular wallet with all their money in anyway. And most people are only giving a few dollars on Patreon, so their is no need to have huge amount of funds in the wallet, and no its not the same as fiat. You are using Sound Money that is not being deflated to nothing.  It just means that you have to put some trust in the developer, but with open source, it shouldn't be a problem as long as you don't auto update your wallet. You will simply set up a monthy push to a specific adress. No need to give the keys to a third party or custodian

Less than 1 cent in fees per transaction? What does this mean? 0.8 cents? That's really expensive if you want to pay for something by the second or even by the millisecond. Let's say you are renting something for a week, the fee would get pretty big and you would have to pay by the hour instead
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:34:09
What about a separate flashdrive with encryption separate in the phone where keys are stored, or go all the way and basicly put a trezor chip in there 
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:53:34
Who decides to change the logo anyway? There is no official logo as far as I am concerned 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:02:18
An old leak was something about a specific secure way of storing it in memory. You don't want to store any keys in the same memory as all the shady apps you have installed. So I guess a separate partition or memory that you can't access

Okey thanks, the article made me think I would have to pay per transaction when streaming

I'm sure bitcoin is willing to adapt. If mimblewimble is better in every way, I'm sure we will start a new chain. If the encryption is flawed, we will change it. If other threats emerge, we will change

The true value to me in bitcoin is its age. Bitcoin has been running for years without being hacked or destroyed and killed by buggs or other issues. That is the power of bitcoin, and that is why I can trust it with real money. Other solutions that could work better could be flawed just like you point out. When somebody pitches me iota or something new, they have the same flaw. They have not been proven to work for an extensive amount of time
People want their money to be safe over innovative which is why most people will stick with bitcoin over a brand new coin that has not been proven to be free from issues. People are now after many years willing to put some big money inte bitcoin. Once some of these new innovations have proven themselves, some might migrate, but bitcoin has everybody beat in this area

Don't download bitcoin core, invest in a hardware wallet. If you have ever visited a shady site on your computer, don't use a software wallet
