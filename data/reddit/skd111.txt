I don't disagree on the physics, just your interpretation of the observed results
And I think any version of an afterlife is wishful thinking.  This the only life we have its over its over, but the universe still continues without you.  You might not be there to see it but it still goes on.

Too large would be higher than needed to bring to full employment.  Negative inflation in 09 was a reflection of the falling level of production in the economy and people hoarding money as a result.  The real constraint is the natural resources of a country.  If the country cannot produce what the government is buying, plus what the public is buying, then prices will rise due to scarcity/supply demand.   
What Fiat currencies collapse, its usually due to an outside factor, like the collapse of the government or rule of law in an area.  When a country who is not a currency issuer has their money collapse, its kind of expected because they are not operating like a country but like a state.  A state needs to balance its books so the money supply doesnt run out, just like a state with a gold backed money supply.  A country can print more, with inflation kind of being a tax on holdings, to encourage people to spend the money and stimulate the economy/more investment/jobs
And yeah a monetary system has always come from power, its long but informative  youtu.be/REbrKOjsG2A

Your 1st point is just flat out false.  For one, there wasnt over regulation forcing subprime loans, it was deregulation.  Two, subprime loans were not the real reason for the housing collapse, its just easy to blame poor people.   In normal times, people in the bottom 1/4 of credit scores account for 70% of housing defaults.  During the 08 crisis is was 35%.  " as the researchers put it, “the rise in mortgage delinquencies is virtually exclusively accounted for by real estate investors.” The share of single-mortgage borrowers who couldn’t keep up on their loan payments barely budged between 2005 and 2008."
Third, deflation is followed by rapid inflation.  Every instance of hyperinflation was caused by deflation, not out of control inflation.  There has never been any quantitative easing that has ever led to hyperinflation.  
Since you cant understand why deflation incentives holding cash watch this
Investment, in this case, means reinvesting money into the business.  If prices are falling and you are reinvesting, you are trying to increase supply with falling demand.    Demand is falling because there is less money in the economy so less spending.  Less spending means less revenue, which means trying to balance less revenue by cutting costs.  Cutting costs means cutting jobs.  
The bread lines was an example from history.  Do you think that was the plan?  Or that was a solution for millions of out of work people?  Think that one through. 
You think throwing around a bunch of nonsense jargon is going to fool someone who is actually trained in this you are only fooling yourself.  You need better sources of information.  No one is stealing from you.  Taxes are the price to pay for living in a civilized society.  You can go back to the Khan days if you want to but i suspect you really dont want that.

You clearly have a fundamental misunderstanding of the financial system.   Inflation is the collateral.  If the government spends too much, ie more than its natural resource capability and spends past the level to get to full employment, then it will drive up prices, ie inflation.  Taxes are only there to take money out of the economy so inflation doesnt rise even quicker and to pay for the rule of law in your country.  
Everything that guy said was spot on in terms of factual accuracy, his opinions not withstanding.

Well in my opinion the tax system should be far more progressive, and you shouldnt get taxed on income at all, only on sales/purchases, so it would  hurt the people on the lower end a lot less than the current system and all the hidden taxes make it so we pay much more of our percentage of gross income than people on the higher end.

Lol is this a serious question?
I'll give you a couple examples of deflation here in the US.  2008, 1930.  Any thing in common in those years?  Those are years prices dropped aka deflation, which are accompanied by recessions or reversals in the economy.  If prices are falling it incentivizes holding money and not reinvesting, ie increasing production and hiring more workers.  So people get laid off, business go under, and millions are in bread lines.  And people with holdings saved up that can afford not to deplete them on living expenses go up and buy everything up for cheap.  Not to mention the social cost of more people out of work.  No that's objectively terrible.  A nation's goal should be full employment because that maximizes its human resources.

YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NATIONAL DEBT REALLY IS
@_date: 2019-01-10 02:33:07
Its to prevent a deflationary economy, which is much worse than a slow growth inflation.

If the government deficit is too large, there will be inflation. The variable that causes (one kind of) inflation is total spending in the economy (public + private). In other words, if we're all trying to buy more real stuff (like food, clothes, cars, houses, etc) than the economy can produce, then prices will rise. If we already had a full employment economy, so that the businesses were producing as much real stuff as they possibly could, but then the government wanted to spend more, how could it do so without causing inflation?
It does so by raising taxes. The hope is that by raising taxes on you, you'll have less money to spend and so you'll buy less stuff. With that stuff now available, government can buy it without causing inflation. 
But when we have an economy far from full employment of workers and raw materials, that means the economy has room to expand production without raising prices, and so the government can increase its spending without raising taxes. 
Watch this and start to get a bit of an understanding
