Is there any news of what is happening to blockchain? 
@_date: 2013-04-21 12:42:10
I did not know that. Sorry.

I've done it with like .1 bitcoins. Trade maybe 5-7 times a day. Yeah its hard but with little BTC I didn't see a huge risk. mainly something to watch and try. I want to try with a bit more, but I don't know.

Sorry I meant blockchain.info
Edit: I am in the process of making a paper wallet so no...

I knew I should have taken those hacking classes at the local YMCA. Best of luck and please post updates when you are up and running. The more exchanges the merrier. 
P.s. what is your main plan to put money on accounts? Bitinstant, banks tranfers?

In reply to this, what is the best way to transfer the cash from one place to another fast? I feel like this is the limiting factor and I don't know of a quick way.

You need to put "verify" at the end to tip. (I think)

Will you be posting updates on here? Or separate threads?
I will definitely be checking up on this.

Well dang, maybe I got lucky?  mine says still needs to be verified but I did it. Um are you withdrawing funds to your wallet? Or what?

I have an unverified account, and put them in my blockchain wallet.

Made an account like 3 days ago on Mtgox and transferred it today.
