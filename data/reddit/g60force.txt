EXTRA INFO: the combination of those 2 words it seems 1month ago a person registered a FACEBOOK page for it, 2 other companies already share that name, albeit it was harder to find then I thought :D still there is no existing CURRENCY plans for it... but that guy with the FB page did mention a EXCHANGE of some sorts, so i guess it would be to confusing if a COIN gets released with the same name as a future exchange, not to mention to possible lawsuits and stuff (which i dont have any clue if i should be worried for that or not)

hmmm yeah i might... gonna sleep it over... cheers!

it consists of 2 words correctly spelled but combined doesn't mean anything (official) but they way to pronounce it can be interpreted differently i think that's what is making it even more special :D
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:40:46
not in US.. EU (The Netherlands) but thanks i could still check it!
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:40:07
Not if I put in specific GOOGLE commandline options ;)
for example: HELLO +YOU -MORON (this example doesn't make sense but did that on purpose ofcrs to give you an idea)

sadly the  already exists :( it only shows a bitcoin logo and nothing more... but the .ORG .UK etc don't exist!
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:55:30
seems like a winner :D
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:54:37
that's not a bad idea :D thnx
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:47:18
no not coin specifically but crypto related :( so that sux... actually that guy created a FB page with plans for an exchange :P
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:54:22
not that it matters anymore... but same as any BITCOIN or ALTCOIN name... but my name really has an awesome ring/sound to it that could be pronounced differently and mean something else :D
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:55:45
i think i do need a team :O
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:37:28
after Brexit... i'd say DO IT!
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:43:08
UPDATE: never mind seems the website is already registered, sooner or later that COIN will come up... (still not gonna mention it though lol)
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:44:31
well i hadn't tought about that part yet, it was just a really good name.. the rest of the plan and team would've come later.. but if the name is shit but the rest is GOLDEN it's also no guarantee :D but your concern is totally valid ;) thanks for your input!
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:56:52
close but no sigar!
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:44:33
YEAH i'm like Trump, but then without the Mexicans :D j/k
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:30:48
lol no it's a combination of 2 real words :D
but combined it seems it's nowhere to be found :O
that's what surprises me so much to actually feel good about it!
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:38:21
yeah will do that thnx... i already google some 3letter ideas, sadly the most obvious for my combination are all taken :(

@_date: 2017-12-27 13:10:11
trust me it's so extremely obvious and simple that one would say WHUT why didn't I think of that... besides why hasn't this been around since the start of Bitcoin... i just remember that i still don't have a 3letter COIN name for it... is there a list that displays all taken 3letter combo's?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:54:54
thats deep shit bruv
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:57:29
