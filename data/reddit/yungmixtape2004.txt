Because increasing the blocksize a bit will only help for a little  until more people start coming in and the blocks are full again. I think that atm we can better invest time in developing these scaling tech like lightning etc.

You can still transact on the main chain though. You don't have to use lightning.

This Square Cash sure looks promising. Great team, great tech, undervalued for sure. I just checked their subreddit and it just felt like bitcoin in its early days. Expecting x100 in 2018 at least ! /s

Lightning needs to come out as soon as possible so that the network can handle these kind of payments.

I think even in it's current stage bitcoin is a better "store of value" then gold. In comparison to gold it's still easier to transfer, way more anonymous , easier to store (takes up no physical space), way easier to buy and sell and even considering the fees easier to buy goods with then gold. 
Ofcourse I think that when lightning and other tech comes out it will be even better but in it's current state it really isn't useless. People these days are so used to instant gratification that they forget it takes a whole to develop these new technologies. Even with the high fees I think that bitcoin is already changing the world, look at Venuzuela for example.

Thank you :)

Yeah I know, but I just find it sad that it seems like most people coming here right now think of bitcoin like a "get rich quick scheme" instead of asking questions, being interested in the underlying tech and how it could change the world.

Before you buy bitcoin you need to have a good understanding of what bitcoin is. Start by reading the resource page from this subreddit, I would suggest start with this: [  . I would also suggest watching this playlist from Antonopoulos [ and if you already have some programming / computer science knowledge you can also read the book Mastering Bitcoin.  Keep reading and looking online till you have a decent understanding of what a blockchain is, what problem it solves, what it does not solve and why decentralization is important. If after reading and watching these videos you are still excited about bitcoin then buy it.  If you are not really convinced it solves any problem but just want to make money then don't buy it because you will likely panic sell it, when it drops in price (which it does a lot). With education you will also don't fall for the trap of buying other cryptocurrencies such as ripple, bch, cardano etc...
Start with a wallet like electrum or if you are buying a decent amount consider an hardware wallet such as ledger.
Mining is not worth it anymore.  
Good luck

Not only scaricity also demand is needed. I could make my own coin with only 3 coins ever made and the price wouldn't rise because noone wants my shitcoin haha.

Actually I would think libertarians would be very happy if we put all our id's on the blockchain. It takes power away from the government who can refuse to accept, delete or manipulate someones identity. If all our id's are on the blockchain the government has less power over us.

Finally the segwit gui is added to bitcoin core
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:19:04
The top release is 0.16.0.

" While some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity (e.g. blocksize increases), this approach generally degrades the decentralized state of the network and cannot reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale. To overcome these technical barriers, we are collaborating on decentralized Layer 2 protocols that run atop these public blockchains to achieve global scale" 
Roger you listening?
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:20:53
Yeah lets hope the segwit transactions % can grow a lot more now.
