Cost per transaction is about $50?  No point in buying a pizza when the transaction cost exceeds the pizza.
While you are being pragmatic about the function, the fact remains that the investors in bitcoin now see it as a buy-and-hold system to gain value.  You *can* buy things with it, but most investors are not.

Tulips didn't gain value from artificial pressure of people buying into it?  I think they did.


While this is a good scenario for you, it really isn't part of the conversation because it isn't a primary use.  Most BTC holders are looking for a big payday from the pump and dump scheme.

Except that it is not being used for that as the primary purpose anymore - the transaction block cost exceeds the value of many of the transactions, so the queue of pending blocks grows.  As a monetary system, it essentially failed already.  
Bitcoin started as a "currency", but it is not one now.  It is a traded CEF where some of the shares are exchanged for goods at a high transaction cost.

It is not digital gold, it is a CEF stock. (closed ended fund)  Further, it is a stock that does not represent anything tangible, not shares in a business, not a dividend mechanism, not any of that.
