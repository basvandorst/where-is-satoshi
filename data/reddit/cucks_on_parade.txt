A lot of folks are.  I did.  Watching the dip now..... of course I don't KNOW that it'll hit below 10k
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:36:25
"know bitcoin has the potential to reach over 100k so easily"
that's still a hard sell.  It COULD easily, anyone can see that.
Will it? Harder to say.  If it drops 50% over night, will you still think that?  Will it be "easy"?
I think personally, we'll see a BIG drop off in BTC soon and a HUGE raise in alt coins. Specifically, alt coins that solve real world issues, and alt coins that are networks like ethereum, ardor, lsk, and xem, alt coins that solve privacy like monero and dash, and alt coins that fix quick cheap payments, like lite coin, monoco and tenx pay cards, etc.  
Then again, with the possibility of atomic swaps, there are alts still in the works like HYBRID that will be able to cross swap between ALL major crypto networks, allowing transactions to happen through one network and swap to another instantly.  This will be a game changer.
Will BTC be the value holder from which all other Crypto bases itself?
Or will BTC fall to actually useful crypto?

Gdax hit nearly 20k.  It dipped to 15k within the same 30 minute window.
That kinda gives a baseline for how hard the questions are to answer
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:26:40
Yup I've seen someone buy Eth super cheap this way, there was a massive sell off on one exchange, and EVERYONE with an Eth buy got a buy in, even the $0.01 orders.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:38:55
Then it's 10% down but it LOOKS like it's going down further, and suddenly the dip is over.  There have been PLENTY of 10% dips in the last 6 months.  But you don't see them until it's too late.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:23:18
That's a good sign there's a correction coming, if the sites can't even handle the load.
Of course, the best time to buy was yesterday.  Last week.  Last year.  Etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:47:10
Yeah that's the whole idea, but people are getting worried USDT isn't REALLY backed up by cash, meaning that if too many people try to cash out..... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:18:44
Yes, but also you have to protect from dips.  By selling and buying back, you're protecting from big losses.  You mitigate your gains, but you're ready.  Everyone agrees, there's a correction coming.  Of course, nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:41:42
I was gonna send from bitfinex to gdax, but realized that it may be pointless, it may take 6 hours out of bitfinex, 1 hour on the network, and be at a loss by then.... 
of course EVERYONE is trying to send to gdax, if they have a supply shortage.  I think the correction is now, the dip coming after.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:45:17
Try diversifying alt coins
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:28:19
Congress can't stop bitcoin.  They can prevent website from USD to BTC payments, they can't stop decentralized exchanges, they can't stop personal sales, they can't stop stores from accepting BTC
I HOPE that congress tries to stop crypto.  If the FCC passes the regulations they want, if they try to step on crypto, it'll just make it stronger.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:18:55
But it's the ONLY way to guarantee your BTC is worth fiat

I'm not that rich.... Also, you can open a credit card with a limit of a BTC still.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:21:47
Well that's why it doesn't fully dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:21:23


Yeah but "willing to lose" then you have to answer with "how much you want to make"
Someone has to sell for someone to buy, huh
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:29:38
When it's 5k next week you'll wish you waited.
Hard to say man hard to say.
I've had plenty and sold years ago.
I've sold perioudically throughout this year, expecting more dips.  
Miss every dip because it's too fast.
Miss some rises because  I cashed out.
Still made money.
Hard to say
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:38:06
Yes.  Yes exactly.  I did.  Watching dip now cautiously.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:15:20
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:37:13
YOU originated from the latter.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:32:48
Only if you place the order to be filled, not if you're filling the order.  And I think you have to work your way to 0%, but a whale would.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:15:46
just wanna bang on my drum all day
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:31:02
Thank goodness SOMEBODY knows
