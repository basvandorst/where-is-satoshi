Managed to sell at 670 and had buy orders at 550, noticed how fast it kept going down so moved those buy orders to 525 and had to rebuy at 680 (still not a big loss)

Personal experience, I bought a house in the Netherlands. Should be completed end of the year.
Ground had to paid in full, now while it's being build I've to pay a certain percentage at predetermined moments (foundation beging done, finished all walls etc) and the last 5% will be paid when I inspected the finished project and agree that they build it all according to the plans.

I've 1,34272506 BTC now  
So 595,80 Euro / BTC  
The actual price / BTC was lower, but I first bought for 500 euro, and later for 300 euro when I realized how low it got.
