Yup, go Socialist, go Venezuela! Or, no. Go Cuba! Wait, that doesn't work either...
You're an idiot.

Almost like those states didn't work internally nor externally before "evil capitalists" did anything.
Stop grasping at straws.

No true Scotsman fallacy. Every time anything near communism was tried, it failed, and it failed for a reason.

The amount of socialists is genuinely concerning

Capitalism has lowered the price of food, transport and communication by 1000 times. I wouldn't call that a failure.

"Written" doesn't mean they fabricated 100+million deaths, economic failure, and general suffering.
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:20:01
I don't want another 100+million dead.
Fuck off to Cuba and enjoy your ghetto "paradise" there

But there's only a finite number of bitcoin, right? So what happens when that number is reached? Do miners still get BTC, and where does it come from?
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:43:41
If someone were to get back the Bitcoins, or were to get access to one of the wallets with 1000 BTC, why would they accept a reward for less BTC and not just keep it?
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:22:31
When they say "Bitcoin was lost", does that mean completely lost from the host, or stolen by an individual?
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:19:14
To be honest I'm not particularly well versed with BTC, its a genuine question. Can the stolen coins be tracked, or would it be possible to launder them with tumblers and such?
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:09:16
Obviously not, but when you have a significant number of people chasing the coins, why would they offer a lower reward than the stolen coins?
