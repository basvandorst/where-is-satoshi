this "closed loop" thing seems totally wrong to me. if i buy a coffee with bitcoin and the coffee merchant immediately turns that bicoin into fiat this closed loop thing suggest that is creates more supply of bitcoin, thus lowering the price. but econ 101 teaches us that the price  is set by supply AND demand. that bitcoin i just spent for coffee will be repurchased by me the consumer to be re-spent. we the bitcoin consumers are creating the demand by trading in our fiat to spend at these merchants. very few in the bitcoin ecosystem are getting paid in bitcoin, where they spend it(add supply) and don't replace it(lessen demand). 
no one is spending their bitcoin savings buying coffee. when most people spend it they buy more. this is the true "closed loop". forget the vendors

i don't get it. why all the "ripple sux" stuff?
do you think they sat around and decided that it would be a great idea to collect personal info on all their customers? 
if you have a problem with this look no further than US government, and stop acting like these companies have a choice in these matters, if they plan on operating in the US

does anyone know the holdings of this investment? is it pure bitcoins?   or companies that are bitcoin centric? seems totally different than the Winklevii thing where each share will be one fifth a BTC, more like the GLD or SLV.
