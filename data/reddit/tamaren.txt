Wasn't sure if this was or for a second.

Eh, personal preference. The Adventador is an excellent looking car, as well as the older models. I am not a fan of the Gallardo or the Hurrican, though.

Honestly, as far as luxury cars go, I think at least the big lamborghinis would be one of the better options. 
Certainly better than the other Italian brands.

Pi is an infinite, non-repeating decimal- meaning that every single number combination exists somewhere in Pi. Converted into ASCII text, somewhere in that infinite string of digits is the name of every person you will ever love, the date, time, and manner of your death, and the answer to all the great questions in the universe. Converted to Bitmap, somewhere in that infinite string of digets is a pixel perfect representation of the first thing you saw on this earth, the last thing you will see before your life leaves you, and all the moments, momentous and mundane, that will occur between those two points. 
Al the information that has existed or ever will exist, the DNA of every being in the universe. 
Everything. All contained in the ratio of a circumference and a diameter.

My number 1 problem with the system is I don't know what it is going to be. Obamacare Tripled the cost of my family's healthcare, and cut benefits down to barebones. But it changes every year. 
I don't give a damn if it's socialist healthcare. We can try that out and see how it goes, and if it works, great! But modern Socialized anything is inherently flawed. 
The problem with the system is that people sue anything that moves. Nobody takes responsibility for their actions and when someone uses an epi-pen wrong, the family sues the company for 20 million. Now that company has to carry 50 million of liability insurance, and that is expensive, so they jack up the price of the product because it costs that much to cover their product.
AND because they are spending all this money to cover their ass, they loose all R&amp;D funding, so they can't make it better.
Tl;dr- Don't sue people.

Interesting. Learned something new. When my folks sold their business I remember them complaining about 40%, and when I sold part of mine on paper it was 40ish. 75k might be under a cutoff or something, that isn't that much money, in the eyes of capital gains at least.
