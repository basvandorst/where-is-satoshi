No, because the *entire value proposition* of BitGo in BitFinex's setup is to prevent this sort of thing.  Finex submits to BitGo a tx they think is authorised (in terms of user logged in OK).  BitGo applies various heuristics that should detect and arrest thefts, and signs only if the tx passes in a wider context.  zanetackett has said [BitGo did sign the stealing txes](

I know we should just wait for answers on this, but **why did BitFinex hire BitGo back then?**  What value did BitFinex think they were getting out of the collaboration?
 * BF didn't think they were insured; so, it wasn't for the insurance.
 * Assuming BitGo is honest and correct that their code worked: either withdrawal limits (and other heuristics) could be disabled via APIs (in which case BF must have known that was a gaping hole) or BF had them switched off; so, no plausible case can be made that it was for the limits/heuristics.
 * BF had multisig before BitGo; so, it wasn't that they couldn't handle multisig in-house.
 * BF ran their own Bitcoin wallets before BitGo, and their own altcoin wallets the whole time; so, it wasn't for buying in an off-the-shelf wallet.
Could it just have been for the association with a company seen to be secure?  Or maybe (I've not checked timelines) BitGo were actually giving away their tech to BitFinex as a first-big-customer (or even *paying* BitFinex to use it) to aid BitGo's image?

If you want to go all the way from a blank machine to verified, you should really combine sets of instructions each covering one [high-level task](  The source best placed to tell you how to install PGP and check its integrity won't necessarily be the source best placed to tell you how to check Gitian builds of Bitcoin.  No instructions will be foolproof (the universe just produces even greater fools in response) and the more you have at stake, the more effort you have to go to.
There are broadly four sorts of attitudes where verifying is concerned:
 * People who are completely unaware that there's any threat to be addressed.
 * People who were never going to verify, and won't start now, and are fine with that.  As long as they take a genuinely *informed* risk, that's on them.
 * People who know they should verify but aren't really motivated, and need a decent excuse to make themselves feel better about not doing it.  Typically anything short of moon-on-a-stick (e.g. having the developers come to your house and do it for you during the weekend) is declared unacceptable.  They [wail and gnash teeth and blame anyone but themselves]( before giving up, which is much worse for all involved than just accepting from the outset that they really belong in the "never going to" group.
 * People who know they should verify, and will do what it takes to work out why and how, on their own initiative (which can include asking for a *little* help).  You can recognise these people by the help they ask for, which shows they took the time to understand *why*, got a decent way through, and just got caught up on some detail of *how*.
That's not to say that it's easy, nor to say that it being hard is inevitable or character-building.  This stuff *could and should* be easier.

SEPA payments which are:
1. to other countries
2. denominated in Euros
are available in the UK.  Theoretically we should also be able to send other currencies by SEPA; the standard supports that, but no participating bank here does.  Also theoretically SEPA should be free, but IIRC the UK banks escape this on some technicality.
Perhaps that "should be free" isn't as simple as I thought.  From the Wikipedia [SEPA article](


Maybe that only applies if there are national payments being made with SEPA too; then, if banks support SEPA for sending £ between banks, they'd have to offer international SEPA for the same (probably zero) fee.

Losing money doing that the wrong way is serious to the people that lose it, and it sounds a little like you're brushing that aside.  Perhaps I'm reading you wrong.


While I tried to make it readable for most people, the people it's worth making a *big* deal for are folks writing or maintaining code that manages other people's money, and might otherwise leave costly bugs in that code.  That could include many Redditors &amp;mdash; not all are here just for Bitcoin's speculation, politics or financial self-determination &amp;mdash; but Reddit helps spread awareness of the (hopefully useful!) resource (as for the [new developer docs]( even if not all coders ultimately find it directly through here.

It gets pretty tiring explaining to newbies that Blockchain.info's security model is really very brittle, so I'm all for their removal unless they take steps to remedy these issues *properly* (since it's clear they're extremely reluctant to ever give their users informed choice).  Consistently, whenever there has been a choice between:
 * best practice, security, correctness
 * traffic, onboarding as fast as possible
Blockchain.info have taken the convenience/traffic choice, but have either been silent on or have misled their users on the consequences.  Only public shamings ever seem to force them into changing anything, and even then it's the duct tape fixes or diversions they deem to be the very minimum required to plausibly deflect negative attention and convince their users (who they know are mostly non-technical enough to be bamboozled).
I genuinely fear that their least-effort attitude to security might lead them to being the next Gox.  Has anyone looked into how much their users lost in the recent Tor snafu?

I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that technical bits are distractions for most people, and with this list (most of which is implied quite neatly by "digital gold").  That said, in my experience of explaining Bitcoin, laymen vary quite a bit in how much those implications jump out at them, how much they care, and how curious they are.  There's no one layman, and I think the OP's idea of trying to come up with *an* explanation is doomed.  Better to have a bunch of resources on hand to match the layman.

I assume you're referring to "we rely on miners to confirm the funds into the block chain".  I can only assume they mean incoming funds, since the context is incoming funds ("if someone should send funds contaminated that way into Coinkite, we rely on miners to confirm the funds into the block chain").  You're commenting on Gox's "funds they sent", which is a different thing, which is my whole point.  Coinkite seem to have tried to say "we don't do the problematic thing Gox did"; what they've said by accident is "we do the good things Gox did do".


Exactly!  It's impossible, because the overwhelming majority (perhaps the entirety) of nodes out there will accept transactions of Coinkite's that have been mutated *by others*, and there's no such thing as a transaction which has no room for mutation.  I'll see if I can find a tx known to be Coinkite's, and show a valid mutated version (but not broadcast it).

I agree :)


So for `signmessage` to validate any and every time a customer cared to verify his balance existed (presumably every validation would include all the steps of ``{prove how much they have, _say_ how much they should have, prove that your account was included in that total}``), that someone would have to be prepared to sign (semi-)arbitrary messages the exchange asked them to.  Plausible, and no way to prove it's not happening.
So an improvement would be for the exchange to demonstrate they could pay out withdrawals using some subset of those UTXOs spendable using the same key(s) used for ``signmessage``.  That'd show they had the immediate ability to spend, or request spending of, at least *some* proportion of the coins they claimed to own.  Being able to spend them on demand is arguably the same as actually owning them, but perhaps they're forwarding spends through to the someone for approval, and perhaps that someone is only prepared to let them have a subset of what the someone will ``signmessage`` for.
What you'd really want is proof they could spend any and all UTXOs any time they wanted to, to another address clearly under their or their customers' control.  Perhaps they could demonstrate this by using a small amount of every single UTXO under their control, to make up each withdrawal, although this is probably incompatible with good cold storage and coin selection.

You can still reverse a CC transaction 6 months (or maybe more) later; good luck doing that with a 6-block-deep Bitcoin tx.  So it stays equivalent to a 0-conf transaction for 6 months.

The reason I suggest &gt;1 hash is that occasionally you might give the hash of a block that ends up an orphan via a reorg, so giving the last few makes it less likely people will panic because your one hash isn't actually in the chain.  The time is nice for humans and doesn't hurt.

He changed his name and appearance since his crypto.pm tricks, so for a long time the question wasn't "a guy with this history"; for most of Moolah's run it seems to have been "a guy with no history whatsoever" (since he'd hidden it and a joke was even made of how he had zero online history).  The Dogecoin folks clearly had serious concerns with the lack of history from very early on, and even when evidence strongly pointed to him being Ryan it was almost impossible to verify anything (Ryan is pretty careful about that) but Ryan turned the community against his detractors, just like with crypto.pm.  What's really sad is that the community bought it.

Great; I'm a software engineer by qualification though, not a cryptographer, so I'd like to highlight that the idea is Greg's, the sentence "All mistakes are mine, not Greg’s" and the paragraph about "Greg Maxwell points out that it’s possible to implement this protocol under a zero knowledge proof..." ;)  My interest is in getting normal (non-crypto) people to realise exchanges *can* do this pretty easily, and making explanations of the less complicated methods accessible to (non-crypto-expert) wallet/exchange/etc operators who might otherwise dismiss it as too much work.

I expect Europe has similar ones with similarly low barriers to purchase^[*] but I don't think there's any neat uniform way yet.
However, Bitcoin is still young and I'd say it's too early to expect much in Bitcoin-based sales (even with that commendable discount) from impulse buyers.  Leave your offers up there; signpost users to the most convenient services you can find, possibly tailored per-country; and wait for demand for frictionless Bitcoin purchase to entice more options/competition into the market. 
[*] It really comes down to how much verification they need, what the account set-up lag is, and what payment methods there are in a given country that are quick and relatively irreversible like Bitcoin.  This seems to vary across Europe and across sites, and depend on the amount being bought.

Swap "nodes" and "miners" and it's no different:
"Miners are important for decentralization, but are irrelevant if they don't agree with nodes. So their vote is not important. They will follow the nodes or be forked into irrelevancy."
Mining is, unfortunately, more centralised so they're the easier participants to find and pressure.
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:04:15
Full nodes that don't consider the miners' blocks valid just won't accept or relay them.  If that was of no concern to miners, they'd just have flouted the consensus rules long ago to maximise profit (e.g. by increasing the block reward).  Non-mining nodes keep miners honest.

And it *wouldn't* matter, except that he has both (1) repeatedly made PRs with subtle creepy side-effects that many people miss on the first pass, and (2) said that his word is final in XT.


Absolutely, but the number of people who seem to have been unaware that XT contains more than just a blocksize change, and been annoyed when they did realise, suggests many people won't read the code or even wait for someone else to.

We're talking about whether it's immature to leave a project if you genuinely believe it no longer has meaning for you.  The eighth post, which is the first hit when you look for "Paypal" in that page, says "I don't have any interest in working on a system that boils down to a complicated and expensive replacement for PayPal."
I'm *not* making any statement about whether they're *right* that XT will eventually equate to PayPal (that'll take years to know); only that I believe them when they say *they* believe it.


I didn't say it was.  What I did say is: the concern that people might start running ill-understood software that departs from a developer's (or indeed user's) vision of Bitcoin is a valid reason to move on to pastures new.  For instance, Mike has advocated redlisting in the past.  If an important quality of Bitcoin for developers (or, just as importantly, for users) is fungibility, the greater threat of users blindly accepting redlisting patches under the benevolent dictator model versus the peer review model would be perfectly reasonable grounds to leave the project.

You're part of a group [on a plane which is being remodelled mid-flight]( with Mike, and out of concern for all on board you refuse him several changes with ill-considered side-effects.  He gets up, declares himself pilot and starts swinging a sledgehammer about, crying "Growth at any cost!  We're redirecting towards PayPal HQ."  Who'd stay on that plane, with the sledgehammer-swinger as the new pilot?
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:45:42


If you're a dev and you genuinely feel the several XT changes are heading away from something unique and special and towards just another PayPal, it's perfectly understandable to direct your energy to something else.
If you're a dev and you believe the Core model of peer review is more robust and safe than a benevolent dictator model, it's perfectly understandable to distance yourself from the latter.  Let's not forget that this particular benevolent dictator previously worked in "[Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance]( and [already]( merged [four]( shaky [PRs]( into XT that [got]( rejected under the peer review model (not counting block size).
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:33:27
No, what's usually referred to as a 51% attack is the ability of a colluding group to *outpace* all other groups trying to grow the chain with blocks universally agreed as valid, with 100% success.  (They can actually succeed in *temporarily* outpacing others with less than 50%, just not 100% of the time.)
This is not at all the same thing as producing blocks that violate the consensus rules.
Going back to your comment that "It's the miners that count."  Seems Mike himself doesn't actually think that way, since he's [making plans for the contingency where miners don't accept his changes but full nodes do](  So it's "XT because miners want it", or, failing that, "XT because the full nodes want it".
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:52:27


It's an attractive aphorism.  Participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem has been compared to being a passenger on a plane being remodelled mid-flight, owing to how easy it is to introduce accidental consensus forks, privacy leaks and attack vectors when making changes (and lots do get made).  Being on that plane, I prefer that changes proceed conservatively.


I'm afraid I don't understand what you're trying to say here.

The fairly common case of clearnet-full-listening-node-behind-NAT will, under XT, make a connection to grab the exit blacklist.  We shouldn't be adding opportunities to monitor full node IPs via a central point.


Agreed, although I'm not convinced that the Tor peer eviction conditions (all inbound slots full) will, as justified by Mike, only ever occur in case of a DoS attack.

"tl;dr" when it comes to money is potentially very dangerous.  In Core, several committers and usually a few other people eyeball the changes; does XT have that attention yet?  I don't know enough on the patched functionality to give a useful opinion, but I strongly believe people should look closely at what's getting in under the radar here.


If "relay the first observed double spend" were generally accepted as a bug with a clean fix available, it'd be fixed in Core; superficial searching says it [got reverted as problematic and contentious]( but I don't know the whole story, nor do I have an opinion on the change.


One is for Hearn's Lighthouse project, and also [got merged, found buggy, and reverted](  Without those eyeballs, would the lack of testing have been addressed and the bug in getutxos have been spotted before it was widely rolled out?
The other is adding back the bitnodes seed node that was [removed for behaving in fishy ways]( and adding a seed run by Mike ~~that (unlike any others) gets to know the connecting node's IP address (which would never be accepted into Core)~~.
Is XT basically going to be every patch Mike Hearn ever had refused by NACKs in Core?  Where does that road take you as a user of XT?
Edit: Conspicuous by its absence from the README is that (AFAICT from the commit comment) [incoming clearnet connections will kick a Tor peer off](  pointed this out below.  So don't just trust the description of diffs.
Edit 2: Correct confusion of DNS seed with [Mike's httpseed thing]( as pointed out by below.  (httpseed would learn addresses AIUI.)
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:24:16
If they hadn't been deemed contentious and buggy[*] when peer-reviewed for Core, they'd be in there already.  The whole reason they're in XT is that Mike can exercise benevolent dictatorship (his words) to put them straight into XT unchanged, but can't get them into Core without addressing the concerns.
So no, they can't just be merged back.

A donated one would have to either:

Edit: **I was wrong**; obfuscation did get merged, per s1ckpig's post below.


Yes, obviously  the *commit object* survived the fork and exists somewhere in the BU repository, but that doesn't mean it ever got *merged* into any BU branch that's alive today.  Having the commit object, buried, is not sufficient to affect the HEAD of any version you're running unless and until you merge it.  BU never merged it, so the presence of the commit object is irrelevant unless/until BU *does*.
But really, to spoon-feed it to you, just **look at the files**.  Let's pick the signature for the declaration of `CLevelDBWrapper::CLevelDBWrapper()`, because it'll differ from the unpatched version by `bool obfuscate` which couldn't be more obvious as an acid test.  To tie this to a moment in time, as of right now the tip for `release` is [6a06bda...]( and the tip for `dev` is [715e68b...](
 * In [Core's patch](
 ```CLevelDBWrapper::CLevelDBWrapper(const boost::filesystem::path&amp; path, size_t nCacheSize, bool fMemory, bool fWipe, bool obfuscate)```
 * On BU's release branch as of right now, [with]( or [without]( a commit ID, line 47:
```CLevelDBWrapper::CLevelDBWrapper(const boost::filesystem::path&amp; path, size_t nCacheSize, bool fMemory, bool fWipe)```
  * Notice that nowhere in the file is there any mention of 'obfuscation'/'obfuscate' nor even the word 'key'.
 * On BU's dev branch as of right now, [with]( or [without]( a commit ID, line 47:
```CLevelDBWrapper::CLevelDBWrapper(const boost::filesystem::path&amp; path, size_t nCacheSize, bool fMemory, bool fWipe)```
  * Notice that nowhere in the file is there any mention of 'obfuscation'/'obfuscate' nor even the word 'key'.
BU **clearly has not** merged the obfuscation keys feature.
Seriously, even as BU's PPA builder, I'd really hope you'd be able to work that out for yourself.  It speaks volumes that you're unable to.

I would strongly recommend getting your *hardware* in order first (memory tests, SMART attribute checks, that sort of thing).  In my experience Pis seem to have regular storage corruption issues and don't have the grunt to reindex (in any useful timeframe) without the assistance of better hardware (a solid installation on a PC).  As long as you have a solid PC installation, at least when the Pi messes up you can sync the PC and copy the blocks/chainstate across to the Pi again, all relatively quickly.

I agree it's inefficient and inappropriate, and I hate the trend of jumping on the "same, but with block chains!" bandwagon.  But it might push innovation in banking and drive settlement times down.
The UK is tiny and a tight banking oligopoly so if anywhere should be able to show the capabilities of centralised settlement, it's there.  And it does; we already enjoy personal/business transaction settlement times of around 5 seconds between different banks.  Comparing with systems at larger scales, times increase: SEPA in Europe is hours up to two days; I understand the US takes about three to five days.  If larger systems have so far failed to extract the full benefits of centralisation, through scale challenges/laziness/complacency/lack of competition, perhaps the inefficiency and ill fit of block chains is still an improvement and might save banks money/improve settlement times.  Hardly a lofty goal, but an improvement.

Because - with probably equally superficial consideration - I see your market as being people who can and will spend their way through the problem (and to an extent, the fact that existing companies can charge what they do seems to confirm this).  Such people typically don't care much about what they save, only about how easy it is.  Learning a new thing is probably a deal-breaker.  I could be wrong though; perhaps a good test would be: how many existing companies take payments via TransferWise?
The market is probably also comprised of significantly more retired people than most.  While I don't doubt that older folks can master new tech, they don't seem to, in practice, until the benefits are really compelling.
That doesn't mean don't try, just that I wouldn't rely on Bitcoin changing the playing field.  Worry first about whether you can undercut existing companies significantly in sterling.
Just my opinion, but I have a few relatives abroad.

[AMT]( has its own networking stack, so the OS doesn't have to know a thing:


The AMT is built atop the ME (management/manageability engine), which runs its own OS on its own Argonout RISC CPU which typically lives inside the PCH (platform controller hub).  The [Ring -3 Rootkit]( used the ARC's DMA to write directly to memory; I expect all versions of the ME can do the same.  You should assume the ME can talk to your peripherals too, since it's billed as being able to remotely provision and apply patches to systems.

I completely agree though that it'd be nice to have sites help you protect your privacy from e-mail providers, ISPs and account compromises.  Don't expect businesses to care unless it looks like they might otherwise lose (or never gain) a bunch of customers --- so what you need to do more explicitly, and encourage others to do, is let sites know it's something you want.  Perhaps if Google adds PGP support to GMail you'll have the argument that it's becoming more widespread.

Combined with usage caps, shaping issues and the necessarily conservative adoption of things like headers-first (wouldn't want to tarpit a 0.9.x node that chooses me for sync).

 * the hindsight of knowing now that any particular crypto construct is broken or weak
 * things we didn't know about building secure distributed systems
 * trade-offs/optimisations we didn't have in 2009, like pruning
Waving a hand a bit, then, maybe break it down into:
 * **Storage**: You'd want to align some kind of [affordable hard drive size history]( with the [chain size history](  At what point the two become compatible depends on what value you take for "affordable".  While many nodes could prune, to argue "conceivable" you'd probably have to assume Bitcoin was impractical unless some number of nodes would consistently be able and prepared to host the full chain for others to do initial chain download.
 * **Connectivity/bandwidth**: Very fuzzy; you'd have to decide what you'd reasonably call distributed/decentralised.  Academia probably had the connectivity in the late '80s, commerce in the early '90s.  Personally I'd discount both, and say it wouldn't be Bitcoin until individuals could run it; either on ADSL or putting personal servers in datacentres affordably.
 * **CPU**: 2009's transaction rate was tiny and I suspect CPUs of the 1995 era would be able to keep up for a while, especially with highly tuned code like [libsecp256k1](  As TX rate rose, it might take so long to verify a block that propagation became a serious problem; perhaps it couldn't continue without [O(1) block propagation](
 * **Memory**: I couldn't say, not being familiar with what the biggest demands on memory are, but the much smaller fraction of mempool + UTXO set cacheable would mean you'd need to consider the I/O throughput to pull it off disk.
 * **Crypto**: (versions of) all the necessary constructs pre-date widespread use of the Internet  (Applied Cryptography, published in 1994, has digital signatures, hashes and symmetric encryption for private keys.)  Signatures would have been substantially bigger before elliptic curves; ECDSA was around from 1992, but maybe it wouldn't have been trusted even if it was the only practical way to fit into bandwidth/storage limits at the time (ECC in general gets less than a page devoted to it in the ~700 page Applied Cryptography).
I'd say the epoch was widespread ADSL.

You're confusing the encoding typically used for Bitcoin addresses with the one typically used for ~~hashes~~ plain hashes.

Maybe they only re-balance the accounts periodically.  I could understand if they decided to deduct a small charge for the time it takes them to fish the imbalance out of their accounts, verify that you're really you and correct it.
If they don't refund you after public shaming, though, you'd have to wonder whether it was because:
 * they decided the time wasn't worth the trade-off of clearing their public shaming here

Good to remind people how to do this, but even better would be to show people where you got your numbers/how you made your decision.  The spammer(s) seem to be targeting Core's [default of 0.00001]( he paid 0.00001013/KiB on [this spammy transaction]( for example.  As with all spam prevention there's a balance to be struck between false negatives (letting spam consume your resources) and false positives (impeding propagation of legitimate TXs).
I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I expect TX size is rounded up to the next KiB before being tested for `minrelaytxfee` compliance.  I think the most common TX forms still sit in the 300&amp;ndash;500 byte range.   So at current exchange rates, `minrelaytxfee=0.0001` is £0.016 or $0.025.  You might just say "I'd have no problem paying that, so that's fine", but consider that there are situations where there's almost no time pressure where it's fine for a legitimate TX to take hours or days.
I think Bitcoin is currently really cheap for the benefits it gives you, and I don't think this has to (or can) last forever, but while miners are focussed on block rewards I see no reason to impede TXs beyond what's necessary to drive spammers out.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:41:12
That's an interesting insight into what can be at stake, thank you.


OK, so there's a situation in which assay was inevitable with or without block or certificate chains; trust is established by having an expert pass judgement and that's enough to keep your upstreams honest by itself.






If the small buyers are trusting the bigger/upstream supplier's reputation, certificate chains seem to make much more sense than a block chain.  Block chains are overkill when people trust each other or a mutual third party --- they're inefficient and require large infrastructure/network effects which are tough to bootstrap and can be tricky to incentivise.


OK, but if goods can't be tied to digital tokens, how do digital tokens change this game?  I appreciate that you can no longer fake receipt of a batch of genuine/high-quality raw material from your upstream unless they collude, since you can only claim to have received what you can produce the tokens for, but that's achievable with certificate chains which introduce less complexity.  With either block or certificate chains you can still switch goods.

Besides good ol' fashioned PR incompetence, there's a fine line to be drawn between business-preserving coldly rational actions (e.g. actively hiding or passively keeping very quiet about problems) and alienating customers.  If Gox had shareholders, would they want you to know that Gox's entire customer base is competing for Gox's [site-wide bottleneck of 10 withdrawals a day]( for all currencies but EUR/JPY?  Probably not.  But then as a customer, would you really want to continue dealing with a business which gave no indication of the scale of withdrawal problems in its [latest press release]( despite this bottleneck and despite the [previous press release]( painting a quite rosy picture?

Well, yeah.  There's nothing to stop a  transmitter achieving compliance by simply sitting on remittance requests for 30 minutes, doing nothing about them, so is this really a problem?  Transmitters have freedom in how they use Bitcoin (or whatever other underlying mechanism) to implement transmission, so this needn't be a technical solution (no need for Bitcoin to implement the delaying/scheduling).


Isn't that just part of the risk that such exchangers/transmitters (and the participant buyers/sellers) take on by nature of the business they're in?  P2P market sites like LocalBitcoins and bitcoin.de honour the exchange rate at the time of purchase, even if the seller takes a while to release the coins from escrow, during which time the exchange rate changes.

Edit: sorry, that's a poor reply to your specific point.  The difference is that if you spend it online you spend it by a Visa/Mastercard/etc transaction, not by a bank transfer, and the merchant takes the hit if the customer/bank reverses it, and the burden of proof that it isn't fraudulent is on the merchant.  If you pay by bank transfer, banks have to fight it out amongst each other to prove fraud.

You could argue that Bitcoin-24 was/is still like this, but many have got their money back in the last month or so.  I've not followed Bitfloor's demise and I'm not saying he's honest nor that he's scamming, just that sometimes the refund process really *is* painfully slow, and it's sometimes indistinguishable from being given the run-around.
Still, it's probably better for your health to mentally write it off than to expect or rely on it.

Thanks for asking the perfectly rational question; upvoted.  There are a lot of comments along the lines of "Bitcoin's future as a payment system is massively overhyped --- look, nobody is spending it!  What can you buy with it today?!?" and in fact Schiff goes on to make that point.  At the same time Schiff seems to be saying at the start of that segment "Bitcoin's worth as a store of value is non-existent --- nobody will keep it after accepting it!".  Making both of those arguments at once seems like a contradiction to me --- damned if it's being spent, damned if it's being kept.  There **are** business out there doing a little of both, accepting it and converting most to fiat on the spot, but keeping a little aside.
To pick a side there, though, the "nobody is spending it!" issue concerns me more, and I'm doing what I can personally to address that.  I'm off to a local business to help them get set up, and in return for their hassle of learning a new thing that won't bring them a significant amount of new business today, I'm promising them a year's worth of regular weekly purchases that I wouldn't otherwise make.

I like the breakdown by area-of-transparency.  Inspired by gmaxwell, may I suggest the addition of:


The motivation is to follow the same path as Bitcoin-based betting: a few sites started doing [provably fair betting]( on their games, and it has become [something approaching an industry standard](  [The same is possible with fractional reserve of Bitcoin deposits]( and the sooner we get a practical implementation to point to or preferentially take our business to, the better.
Not to excuse them, but I suspect MtGox:
 * produced that support page some time ago by copying and pasting all the individual payment blurbs you see as you change the "method" dropdown while logged in, and haven't updated it
 * would say they have bigger problems that have to come first
I agree that the failure to be upfront about SEPA delay is very poor customer care, especially as the asymmetry between deposits and withdrawals can easily lull you into thinking you can get € back as quickly as you can deposit them.

No; it's possible, but not easy, to ask whether this has happened (provided you know when your last backup was).  Running the getinfo command in the debug console will give you something including e.g.:

If you're mining solo, you do at least need to know the latest block on the longest chain, which does require having at least part of the blockchain (to know that it's the longest chain).  You can get away with having only part by making the assumption that nobody will ever have enough hashpower to make any fork after, say, 100 blocks.  Bitcoin-QT and at least some SPV wallets like "Bitcoin Wallet" for Android have the concept of 'checkpoints' which are a similar idea.

It'll certainly *allow* the network to become more robust; I'm certainly much more likely to buy a Jalapeno with just the goal of break-even over a couple of years, in the knowledge that it's much easier to set up than previous rigs, competitive for a while and knowing that doing so decentralises mining a bit.

Use of an exchange does not imply a business transaction, and it shouldn't make any difference whether orders are matched automatically or by user choice.  In the UK at least, what seems to make Bitcoin (or other) trade "business" is purchase with the intention to re-sell.
The VAT thing seems odd.  I think currency (including gold, but oddly not silver) is specifically VAT-exempt, at least in the UK, perhaps because you very obviously *can't* add value to it as it passes through your hands, so you'd think recognition of Bitcoin as any form of currency &amp;mdash; even if not "officially" as "money" &amp;mdash; would make it exempt.

There was a [(fact-light) forum posting]( on this a few weeks back.  Seems they join [TransferWise]( and [Tranzfers](
Getting fiat from the UK to exchanges is getting tricky thanks to these account closure threats from the banks.  I really don't think they're doing it because they see Bitcoin as a threat or miss the fees they'd get from SEPA; I think they just see it as a high-support activity and don't want the costs, with the UK current account market being as competitive as it is.  I guess we'll know that's the case if they start denying SEPA directly to exchanges.

I expect this'll get a few "BUNA"-style comments, but similar moves have shut down many routes to Bitcoin exchanges --- TransferWise, CurrencyFair and Tranzfers all recently ceased to process such transfers (even though at least TransferWise and CurrencyFair, and very probably Tranzfers, required all the AML/MLR documents/compliance from individuals using them).

The Mastercard/Visa/PayPal of Damocles hovers above Bitcoin just as tentatively.  Obviously they can't take the fight to Bitcoin, because there's nowhere to send the legal threats, but if/when they see Bitcoin as a threat they'll put pressure on whomever they have to --- probably lower-level merchant services first, and then merchants themselves, e.g. in exclusivity clauses.
Barclays, the UK high street bank, closed MtGox's account with them, and (anecdotally) seems to be closing accounts of traders on   Metro Bank closed InterSango's.  They'll try targeting anyone Bitcoin-related if they believe it's in their commercial interests and within their legal rights.  Sure, they'll never entirely stop Bitcoin, but they don't have to; they need only make it a pain to use, or undermine users' trust in it, to be seen to be doing what shareholders would want.

Part of the idea behind banks is that the inability of new players (including Bitcoin) to enter the market has been defined for some time.  An entire cartel has entrenched around this idea and millions have been invested.  Allowing a newcomer like Bitcoin in would essentially alienate the entire banking sector ...
Alright, I'm twisting the analogy a bit.  Of course existing miners would like to preserve the status quo, but that doesn't intrinsically make the status quo good or acceptable.  I'm not saying I agree with the PoW change (I haven't made my mind up yet, and I haven't seen anyone offer a concrete, tested compelling alternative) but proposed changes need to be considered in terms of whether they address a realistic technical threat first, and in terms of politics second.

Banks are understandably very tight-lipped if they're freezing stuff for AML/fraud reasons; they don't want to reveal their flagging methods to fraudsters (and by law MUST not reveal to launderers) if they suspect the account is being used that way.
That said, as soon as you've demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that you're really you and that you made the transaction, they should just unfreeze it, no more questions, or you should bank elsewhere.

Deserved, seeing as ThePiachu seems to be the only author of any unit tests for the Satoshi client, from my very superficial searching.  Anyone drudging through unit tests is surely a guardian of Bitcoin :)

Sort of.  The weakness of ECDSA if not given truly random k isn't quite the same as the inability of Android to provide good entropy.  Nils said in the first link you posted:


But by that measurement, it's been known about since ECDSA was designed.  Nobody would expect ECDSA to hold up if given crap entropy, howsoever that occurred.


The *effects* of it were.  The cause wasn't known then.  The case wasn't fully investigated then, sure, but it's not like someone sat on the knowledge of the weakness, which readers could infer from your wording.

This is exactly the kind of case where it's almost definitely more effort than it's worth for someone to engineer a double-spend, so hardly worth bothering with (for them pull off or for ragmondo to mitigate).  Just accept the tx on trust.  Perhaps a future version could watch the chain for later, confirmed spends of the same UTXO to someone other than you, and kill the user's connection if that's spotted, but it's a nice-to-have.

This was surprisingly realistic and level-headed compared to the usual laughably overhyped, fact-light, poorly researched and poorly written article on how Cyprus/Africa/whatever are undergoing a Bitcoin "revolution".
Seems there really is a small-but-growing interest over there now.

Heh, just above four stories about SR raids.

No, but it became the norm for Bitcoin-based gambling sites to provide provably fair betting.  It'd only take one exchange or online wallet service to start doing it for people to have something to point at and say to their exchanges "why aren't you doing that?".

Fortunately, there should be a way to be this transparent about the Bitcoin part of an exchange's holdings using a technique from gmaxwell.  As he has pointed out, provable fairness is well on the way to becoming an industry standard for Bitcoin-based gambling sites, and it'd only take one or two exchanges to implement this to make the same happen in that market.
It's up to customers to make it happen though.  Work through it, pick holes in it, and if you're satisfied it'd work, ask your exchange(s) to implement it.

Sort code is 406080 which comes up as what appears to be an HSBC sub-bank: CashFlows A, VOICE COMMERCE LIMITED, with beneficiary "Mayzus Financial Services Ltd" (same that BTC-e use?).

I'm no fan of Gox, but I'd hardly call them *responsible* for the popping.  IMO any upset could have done it; perhaps Gox's engine troubles happened to trigger the fall, but if they hadn't then something else inevitably would have within hours/days.
