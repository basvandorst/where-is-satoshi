Bitcoin is a meme.  It's hard to stop memes from spreading

I think "Quantitative Easing" is hilarious.  Never has there been so much deceit in 2 words.

Save the word bitcoin for the end.
Keep it shorter:

I wonder how steep the DAG curve will be?

I don't see how people don't get this.
It is nothing like any of the old stock paradigms.
The old markets were massively manipulated.  EVERYONE can see this.

With the CME futures coming, big time traders with have 2 basic moves to make:
1) bet **btc goes down** at a certain time
2) bet **btc goes up** at a certain time
To really make money you need to guarantee returns via manipulation
**case 1**
for case 1 they would need to have bought enough beforehand to sell off at a particular time and hope there are not a lot of buy orders at that time.
Best case: decent gains
worst case: infinite.  
**case 2 **
Call a date then buy a shit ton right before that date
best case: decent gains
worst case: decent loss
**key reason:**
Many players are big enough to move the market up when they want to, but none are big enough to sell what they already have and guarantee other buys won't come in.  Maybe they have accumulated enough to do this, but I doubt it.  Why roll dice when you can guarantee yourself massive gains?  Some will guess right on the down turn, but most wales will make a killing on betting it goes up.  Their is less risk in betting it goes up.
tldr: the price will go up over the next year with some big days of volitility
I think
