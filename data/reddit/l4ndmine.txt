homie go check the price of bitcoin three months ago. Now check your best stock for last year. We are doing years and years of stock hit's in weeks/months. either you are a greddy moron who doesn't understand markets or you can continue to enjoy (what should be illegal) gains that btc brings.

Congrats on the ledger

No but the IRS is/has/is going to access there database and if you think that won't happen your in denial (please look up the term.). eBay, and Amazon were pretty easy to sign up for a while back but time came when the 1099-k form's started getting issues and guess what..? Over 20k through your account (or 200 sales) per year will get you an automated slip letting you know that all of your income has been reported to the IRS and that you act accordingly.
I don't get these people who think coinbase isn't a bank, and that cashing out whenever they want won't have tax implications. If you cash out crypto on coinbase (or any exchange that accepts usd bank accounts.) you have to report it, period.

bro wait three days and jump on the moon bandwagon. it's almost impossible to time buying BTC. It's also never been a bad decision to buy BTC as it always shoots up 70% from a 40% correction.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:18:10
yup lots of jealous non bitcoiners around bro. People think it crashed yet it did 99.9% better then any other investments (with the drop included.) this month, period.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:50:17
This is the wost idea ever to store BTC..  I gurantee you guys they only said that for the camera. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:26:34
asshole what's the price now?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:48:17
Don't be this guy? Remember BTC went to 2700 and then 1500? Did people at 2700 get hosed? What about 5k to 3k? Did the people who purchased at 5k get hosed? This is something people either get or they don't. You can buy BTC and sell 3 minutes later thinking your a psychic-- or you can do what all of the wealthy investors on here do... BUY IT AND WAIT YOUR TURN. If you buy BTC and think you got the best possible deal on it then this niche isn't for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:26:38
yeah he's been really off the mark so far SMFH. Dumbass.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:35:48
BTC is 13,948 and is going through it's normal 40% correction. When has this not happened asshole? A few days off !RemindMe 4 days
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:27:28
Let's be honest. Anyone who's held BTC more then 2 months has over 400% gains on there initial investment. Don't come on here and think everyone is poor like you bro.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:31:53
yawn... when btc hit 10k many went "fiat" waiting for the 7k incoming correction by many on this sub. If you don't hodl and you wanna get pissy because you know it's going to shoot up on Sunday ( !RemindMe Monday ) and you either don't have enough or went fiat stop trying to spoil the party. Were up 4k in a few days and it's showing no sign of any correction. Only a crackhead would try and short BTC on the start of futures most people will have there interests in the prices going up (as they have been all year, and will continue to.) while only a few will place shorts on a drop. The longs will win, there will be small drops but this thing finally has legs and if you think the "slow trickle" to buy up all 21 (or more likely 15m coins) is going to just keep going at this pace your wrong. There will be huge increases in 2018 with only a few small corrections and BTC will hit it max value sooner then everyone thinks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:06:11
dude !RemindMe 3 days and tell me the fucking price don't worry idk what everyone thinks is going on. Remember China banned this shit and it dropped to 3k and did the same shit it's doing now. It will be 20k in a few day(s)
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:01:21
That was a great idea! I would have waited until Wall Street started the futures market (as you see now the price hit 19k today.) but uhm... nice timing I guess
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:24:01
bro stop hating there will be btc and bch in the future !RemindMe 3 years

@_date: 2017-12-25 12:52:04
Bro i'd slap his ass in the face..
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:20:06
you would also owe 30% profit on your earnings to the irs. Hodling is usually the best strategy-- a lot of people are going to get letters in the mail in a few year(s) letting them know every time they cash out they owe 30% of the profits (short term).
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:09
!Remindme 2 days
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:48:12
Honestly.. seeing people complain of lost coins, and asking if leaving coins on an exchange is a good idea-- gets old. The ledger is something 99% of people are going to wish they had purchased in a few years. This guy's girlfriend has a brain-- a ledger is almost necessary for crypto. Just because your cheap and don't care about exchanges sharing and selling your information doesn't mean you have to come on here and be negative for no reason.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:09:40
I WOULDN'T BRAG ABOUT THEM WHEN SOMEONE IS TALKING ABOUT CRYPTO BECAUSE THE TOP PERFORMERS HAVE ALL HIT HIGHER NUMBERS THAN THE STOCK MARKET WILL/WOULD IN ABOUT 300-450 YEARS. I WOULD DEF. NOT BRAG ABOUT YOUR MUTUAL FUNDS AND STOCKS BRO JUST SIT YOUR SAD ASS IN THE CORNER SOMEWHERE. YOU COME OFF AS JEALOUS AND TRUST ME HOES DON'T LIKE THAT SHIT YOU LOOK LAME AF.

Why don't you get a job bro?? 2 paychecks are better than 1.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:47:02
uhm, yes coinbase does report usd hodlings they are fdic insured!
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:41:02
nice job selling at the end of a 40% correction! That's panned out well in the past.. Moron.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:54:11
uhm. btc is up $3k for the week... (also levels unseen) so it pretty much evens out to an amazing week. Not one of the worst. like wtf?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:08:07
a lot of people who sell have no idea how fucked they are going to be if they went USD every time BTC dips.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:50:26
Honestly I think BTC will hit the 500k mark within 3 years. Max price is too hard to call because too many things can happen but I don't see it slowing down and I think the banks will (some already have) mine them, and people will buy contracts for the future mining so I think they will be accounted for faster then most people think. In 8-9 years I don't see many BTC being up for grabs.. Once the ETF lands it's game over, and people are going to regret going altcoin (with the exception of a few.) Millionaires will (and have been) eat them up quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:25:05
dude it's a fact bch is faster... until btc can upgrade bch will keep rising. no big deal to btc stop bitching.

Thanks for that bro!
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:39:26
uhm. hardware wallet/cold offline storage or your a n00b. If you can't secure btc you can't use a computer. Don't be me a few years ago overthinking the security.
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:44:17
HAPPY NEW YEAR CHINA!
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:33:22
ETH is never going to be a currency and was never designed to be one. It's pretty much Blockchain's windows-- it will be revolutionary but it's not ready right now and if you think your smarter then everyone and go ETH in 2018 you'll wanna kill yourself for not going BTC.. this happens every year just go get your ETH if you know more then the founder who said it's 3-4 years away from being ready to go.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:07:38
it will go down if ico's get regulated--- 80% are scams bro ETH is NOT but it WILL take a hit if they introduce regulation/registration for ICo's

@_date: 2018-02-05 11:36:11
yeah sell your stack right now and buy back in at a lower price if you think it's going lower.. if you want to short with leverage you can use poloneix that's fine if you want to get wasted!!
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:52:28
95% of my net worth in BTC over here bro-- sorry everyone is not a pussy like you. Last years morons are this years winners-- don't get left behind. Tons of redditors have 50-99% of there net worth in crypto that's why we come on here. Go comment on a lib article that says BTC is going away you just made yourself look like an ass. EVERYONE IS NOT AFRAID LIKE YOU SORRY--
Oh and Brian Armstromg only gets paid in BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:59:25
PRO TIP: It's not the amount of coins.. it's the percentages the "coin" goes up from the time you make your initial investment.
If BTC is worth 100k, and ETH is worth 2000... would you rather have 1 BTC or 50 ETH? You would make the same exact amount of money... coin counters are what we call n00bs.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:37:52
Eth will hit 50-100k as well it is just going to take much longer then most people think. When ICO's have to register and 99% of them go poof you will see what I am talking about. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:08:51
uhm, no. just read the OP and if you think anything there is incorrect let me know.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:38:07
ehhh not really. 1 year to date-- yes. But after the flash crash/Cuban incident BTC has been running with the torch-- and it will be the first to get ETF.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:14:57
150bil+ market cap please explain how a "few whales." could hold most of bac? It's people like you that just don't get it. Do you think Bill Gates, Carlos Slim, and Warren Buffet pulled all of there funds out and went BTC?

ico's r gone get regulated

You gotta love the poor bastards on here who didn't buy BTC last year trying to school vets lmao

@_date: 2018-02-02 12:30:55
Wow your not smart. Ethereum's founder said it will be 3-4 years before ETH is ready for the spotlight... Monero is used for money laundering and will not last (period.), Litecoin's founder sold his entire stake and warned everyone of the price going to "12.00" (unquote).. EOS is the only decent coin you've named. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:42:40
about a grand... thanks Santa Claus.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:39:04
I agree with  this. I am not saying Eth is a shitcoin it just needs 3-4 years before it hits the potential btc is about to hit.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:38:57
Only a pussy invests what they can't afford to loose. Congradulations for being reddit's  pussy. This same cycle is going to keep going on until all 21 million coins are mined. BTC is going to be 25k before 2019 100%... WHO THE FUCK IS SELLING AT 7K???? WHO, WHAT, AND WHY????
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:42:01
Dude I bought a ton of BTC at 3k it went to 1500... 5k went to 2990... this is NORMAL and the people who succeed in bitcoin are the ones who can weather the storm. Look at the bitcoin died website you'll see this has happened frequentley and just like when it's up 30% .. when it's down 50-60% it's just a matter of time before the dead cat bounce and half the morons who bought btc at 19 and sold under 10 are going to be the laughing stock of this subreddit. For some reason until this happens most people are in denial. This is why the stock market requires accredited investors-- go look at coinmarketcap. ALL OF THOSE NOOBS ARE GETTING REKT. Period. This is why only 5% of the people control most of the wealth in this country (USA)-- ONLY 5% of the people are smart enough to make proper investment choices, and hold during the storm. See GOLD, AAPL, AMZN, NFLIX

please show me an example of a cold storage "attack."... Do not respond with potential mim malware/phishing attempts.. Show me one time where someone used a Trezor/Ledger/Cold Wallet-&gt;Clean/Wiped Machine who lost there bitcoins. Don't show me an example of some moron who wrote his backup information on a piece of paper next to the toilet before he went on vacation and when he came back he blamed bitcoin... REAL EXAMPLE PLEASE. Sorry for being so hard on you but I used to say the same stupid shit as your saying and I lost myself a whole lot of money procrastinating over "securing" your btc. If you honestly can't handle the task i'd go for Coinbase's offline storage option. This is not a great idea though for obvious reasons (48hr withdrawl wait). 
Bottom line if you can use reddit you can secure your btc it doesnt matter if it's a dollar or a billion it's simple as checking e-mail.
