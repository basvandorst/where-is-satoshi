You can always comeback 24h later to save you time. So votes will be visible and sorting will work

I think everyone cup of coffee can be on blockchain as long they are willing pay fee, but it can be not so practical. Say 5$ for coffee and 1$ fee (just example). So you have to deal with trade-off, willing to pay more or deal with third-party and don't pay this "huge" fee.

Well guys what are you waiting for, put bounty on
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:26:39
I don't really need that but lets get ball rolling I've put 5$ to get this started. You can put expiration (deadline) if you put more than 100$

Only thing I hate about bitnodes is horrible font, some letters unreadable unless you are using retina display or just zoom. why use so small font?

You guys know about  right? They accept bitcoin, much easier to support specific issue/pull request

Here better presentation from [Daniel J. Bernstein]( author of NaCl (Networking and Cryptography library)

No prove - no fine. 
Otherwise this may work like throwing in bag of narcotics but this time flash drive with bitcoin wallet. So just another repressive law to use it selectively

Selling? Hell no, buying even more and suggesting to friends do same
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:56:14
From my understanding this applies only to wholesale pricing, otherwise you just stuck on regual price

Its not about tools, its just US have crappy internet.

If you are on windows bitcoin-qt.exe file have strange datestamp though - 01.06.2013 4:00 for both 32bit and 64bit versions

They basically saying you are steal our cut, payback time. Otherwise there zero reasons why it should own anything to gov't

Even though new version is now using secp256k1 instead openssl I find almost no performance improvements when doing rescan blockchain, still takes about 5 minutes or so to do full rescan.

callwithus accept bitcoin

Well they can leave that option to those who already tied credit card to prevent this.

17,7% annual growth is completely reasonable if we considering cpu/memory/bandwidth grow overall. It even growing at more smother peace than BIP101 (every 97 days).
But only issue is initial block bump, if they start with 4-8MB I'd completely support that BIP more than BIP101. And it could be more early than 2017 honestly. I pretty much sure XT supporters agree on that. With 4Mb blocks you get about 2-3Mbit upload with about 50 connected peers.

Exactly what it says, recovery phrases now supported not only in English. So people who doesn't know English could easily remember recovery phrases

leech-only will exist, there still lot people in other regions who can run node with 100mbps with just as cheap as 20$ per month or even less currently.
I do agree p2p network may starting fall apart with overly big blocks though but even with max 32MB blocks you still can handle about 100 leeching nodes with just under 50Mbit
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:24:51
4*1.177^yr is more sensible than original 1MB block grow even still its conservative but Sipa's grow is smoother because it grows every 97 days which I prefer than BIP102 step increase in 2 years
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:35:31


So be leech-node only, since you can't support network with your connection but you need full security.

But last time chinese miners spoke, and they seems dont like idea to run XT. While i agree most miners probably not relly well informed about all stuff, thus fall into conclusion too fast. And in same time we should understand that miners here to earn money, and they follow money. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:25:45
Even though many users(myself included) willing to run XT as full node, it won't be complete w/o miners on-board

How do you plan make it available on iOS? NFC isn't accessible currently for user apps, you just assume that ios9 will have these API for you to work on, is this correct?

Guys, I don't want sound harsh but sites with full-video background is kinda distracting and annoying.

It doesn't say anything new, besides that they are working on law to forbid all but legal tender (Russian Ruble) and this is probably happen this year.
And that this is mostly will be used to attack specific people, like instead of drop-in drugs they use usb-flash with bitcoin wallet, to prosecute you

I don't know how I missed that faq.
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:03:12


this is 1 satoshi which is minimum possible value. At some point satoshi may be have value more than goods you willing to buy. I understand that probably far away future, but still.

Why bitcoin.com run "90s" forum software? Why not use something like  as almost all forum software nowdays almost made no improvments regarding usability since early 00. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 21:06:42
I'm all for namecheap but current redesign of dashboard is shit. I know previous was dated but current even worse in term usability, yeah it looks fresh and modern but it waste so much space.
One of worst examples is DNS managment try to manage zone with more than 5 records, nope it will take more than one screen, you have to scroll.
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:10:03


I never heard that is possible, can you point me to some documents(code?) claiming this is possible?
Well I'm not quite understand how sidechain will change anything about value of satoshi? Or you saying that sidechain will allow you to deal with values lower than satoshi?
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:31:57


using "www" in addressbar just make it more 90-ish, who use www especially when you are using new tlds, it no longer looks smooth

I think lost bitcoins are one of downside (probably only one) of bitcoin, since it only produce 21M coins.
Deflation will [keep] rise no just because of demand but because people will keep losing their coins.

Yes. thinblocks, parallel verification. BU did lot work on bottlenecks parts. Lots of them satoshi leftovers, like current threadlock when block verification done, and rpc will be unresponsive and tx broadcast will not sentout until thread will be finish verification
