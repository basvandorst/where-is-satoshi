Thats a lot of money! Do whatever you can to talk to someone involved in the case.

lmao nope. these things are cyclical. once we swing back democrat taxes are only going up. then republicans can cut them back to where we're at. rinse, repeat.

Are you suggesting cap gains tax is going any where but up?

Hi I'm new. I'm pretty used to trading but BTC is confusing me.
Do you guys use GBTC? I also see BTC-USD on forex but I'm not really about that. 
Edit I'm on fidelity. I know RH has some kind of crypto market but dont want to go back

lmao i dont need to call them this isnt the 80s
But yeah there is no BTC ticker in fidelity just the GBTC and a few other penny stocks so I'm confused if this is the right one. GBTC is up 20% today! Is it rallying because of negative sentiment in the overall market? Even GLD isnt up so much

Yeah I dont want to do the trust if I can own directly. What is the ticker? I dont see BTC on fidelity
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:12:22
what is the catalyst for this bull run? just general market uncertainty leading investors to a safe haven? do you think it will continue to rally? i'm considering putting 10k into this

Which is why i asked for help. Thank you for your helpful comment

yes i know how stocks work.
I didn't realize BTC wasn't a typical stock but its own currency. A bit scary trading 24/7 but I guess that's how forex works too. Do you guys have options?
