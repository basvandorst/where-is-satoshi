Depends......maybe it is ? Maybe it isn't. Some say buy, some say sell. No one knows for sure and if they did they wouldn't be here on reddit telling the likes of you and me.

Don't know beepi but I bought a 86 mk2 escort ( 1.6 but badged up as a xr3i) from cockney Dave down Hammersmith road last Thursday and i paid him in bitcoin. Was only 0.3 btc and a bargain I thought until I got stopped by the rozzers for being in a stolen vehicle.

Nice and I guess I should click the link on the other message to collect it but I going to have to decline. I am unfortunately banned from having any bitcoin. A while back I had almost 40 btc but then got addicted to cam girls.  They took every last satoshi from me, all I have left to show for it is a couple pairs of used panties. It got so bad that I tried a armed robbery at a local bitcoin meet up but my phone battery died before I could scan their qr code and I got arrested. Part of my parole is not to have a bit coin wallet so I can not accept your tip

Last time I offered a "pro" a tip she turned out to be a undercover police officer, undercover indeed, bitch was looking well trashy. Anyway I paid the fine and I certainly will be staying well away from any pro tipping in the future.

Ah fuck, just seen the travel news and 2 reports of delays on my route to work.

Im going to change banks if they do. It may be a inconvenience to travel over the border to austria each time I need to go to my bank but I'd rather do that than be stuck in a queue between some smelly homeless people and terrorist asylum seekers. Banks are for rich people for goodness sake,  what a ridiculous plan.

Thats a interesting read but I really must confess that the idea just popped into my head while watching her solve math puzzels on today's countdown.
