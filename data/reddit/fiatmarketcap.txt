that's slightly bigger change for me to snapshot regularly and present it. not in the near term, not enough time between work and sleep. ;)

Thanks for feedback.
When I use the term fiat currency I'm referring to its utility as a store of value, not as medium of exchange.
I know the methodology is crude and data inconsistent(mix of M3/M2). It's used to illustrate a point and provide some bearings on where BTC stand.

Thanks for the feedback, I'll admit I'm no expert on this subject.
I'm going by [Investopedia's definition of M3](
"The M3 classification is the broadest measure of an economy's money supply. It emphasizes money as a store-of-value more so than as a medium of exchange"
Which makes sense for me to use for my comparisons.
And the fact that I can only make use of easily (aka cheaply) accessible public information as this is a hobby project with very limited resources. ;)
I think fractional reserve banking is more around how much debt you can create out of the money supply but frankly I'll be out of my comfort zone to talk about it in depth.

Thanks for the suggestions.
I thought about what I wanted to achieve and decided I wanted to focus on the store of value aspect of BTC. There are already plenty of website that tracks the up and downs of the price.
So next improvement I want to add is to show how much money supply increased across various time periods (1y/3y/5y/10y etc). So you look at a fiat and can see straight away how much value of your saving in that fiat has been lost.

This is the theoretical number of circulating BTC based on blockchain size.
You are right it does include coins where private key is lost.
No one knows exactly how many coins are lost so it's easier to stick with theoretical as circulating supply.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:29:33
I definitely see where you are coming from.
All the conversion to BTC are hypothetical price in a vacuum.
I don't think of them as a peg more like a different way of thinking about store of value.
If one day BTC becomes the ONLY store of value then all the fiat currencies will be &lt;= 21mil BTC.

Good suggestion, I'll add it to the list to see how feasible it is. For now focus is more on fiat.
 I see gold and BTC as a generational choice. Older generation will naturally gravitate to gold, younger to BTC. So even though they fill the same role, their target audience is different. For now.
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:28:09
That's the whole point of the website: to get people thinking in BTC denominations.
Once you get used to it it'll become intuitive. ;)
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:50:40
nice one, cheers.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:37:16
hah, not yet but at least we have an alternative in BTC now.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:28:24
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:01:50
thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2019-06-16 10:13:28
glad I wasn't the only one!
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:29:49
No plans right now to include others. I want to flush out the fiat as store of value story first. Thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:10:37
Thanks for raising it, I will check.
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:04:11
it's from trading economics website, cheers.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:30:45
thanks champ, every satoshi counts ;)
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:39:33
Thanks for the suggestion.
I haven't include it for now as the % will be very small.
But given the coming halvening it will definitely be interesting to track.
I'll have a play later and see if it makes sense.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:44:03
It's short for satoshi.
There are 100,000,000 satoshis in 1 BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:18:54
Not too much extra info to show. Anything you like to suggest?
@_date: 2019-06-16 10:28:09
 I do round down, maybe I should round up? :)
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:03:31
I'll be on [twitter]( to give weekly ranking movements ;)
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:46:00
the idea is great but probably won't happen in the near term.
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:50:55
see reply above
@_date: 2019-06-16 10:27:09
Agreed, each country's market cap can be adjusted to different cost of living in each country.
(aka purchasing power index)
So potentially two columns instead of one:
* MarketCap
* Purchasing power adjusted market cap
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:44:33
funny but so true...
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:18:09
Can you clarify what you mean by "math doesn't even work"?
Are you suggesting a "BTC multiple" to indicate how many times bigger/small relative to current circulating supply of BTC?
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:48:34
see above reply
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:01:56
Great suggestion!
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:27:44
Thanks for sharing, it's good to know. Yes I'm using publicly accessible info on the internet.
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:47:47
I'm comparing fiat vs BTC as a store of value, so M3 is the one to use. Cheers.
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:19:46
no you don't ;)
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:26:56
BTC will grow organically and climb the rankings as it becomes the store of value people trust.
i.e. every country's money supply will eventually be able to be measured using the max supply of BTC.
