You are mistaken. As the price of a coin changes your asset's worth does too. You put in 1000, bitcoin drops 10% your coins are worth 10% less. You wanna transfer it back to your bank account? You only get 900, minus fees. A full bitcoin is 1,00000000 the decimals are called satoshis. The smallest amount you can own is 0,00000001 Bitcoin, or 1 Satoshi.

Hey, can I ask a follow up question? Where do you see Bitcoin in the future? You talked a lot about the weaknesses compared to fiat currency and the current financial system. What do you think bitcoins role will be in the future and do you think the world will switch to a crypto currency in the future if technology improves and they become more secure, faster, etc.?

What if all the people that dumped BTC today just felt bad that we didn't have time to post all these memes and they wanted to give us a second chance...!

it is located in the first district in Vienna so the rent must be pretty insane. would be a stupid location for money laundering though (since it's right in the middle of Vienna in the tourist district)

Yep have the private key and my account has normal pw/2fa protection. you have two wallets one for fiat and one for bitcoin

sure [here]( are some screenshots of the app, the desktop site looks quite similar. you can see your fiat wallet aka. bank account, and you can trade/swap at any time to Bitcoin. of course you have to register your bank account with all the details like address, tax ID etc. like a normal bank account. your crypto wallet is your own though, you have the private key. it is very simple and intuitive and everything seems to work just fine
