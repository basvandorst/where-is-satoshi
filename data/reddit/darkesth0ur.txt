I work in one, thanks for the comment.

I'm curious about your p2p exchange thoughts. :)

Not exactly analogous. The amount of work required to mine real gold with a pick axe, is many orders of magnitude greater than plugging in a computer.  Axes were also not being presold, and then distributed many months after mining was no longer profitable.

That's what you get for investing in the Magic The Gather Online Exchange.

They exchange through coinbase.

Google image search is as easy as drag and drop.

Shitty cube satellites.

Selling doesn't raise the price. That's the point here.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:19:35
That's a horrible analogy. There are actual physical country flags all over. Fake physical bit coins don't represent anything. They could be arcade tokens as far as any layman is concerned.

So are you paying rent/mortgage/loans with it? Or are you converting it back to real money. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:39:26
It's not kind of like saying that at all. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:13:55
If bitcoin is ever to become something big, it's going to be regulated, and taxed. Regardless of what everyone would like it to be.

There is no way on this earth you are going to ROI in 10 days with that thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:31:18
They cost nearly a bitcoin per box too. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:01:19
How is it a new business, when you're only accepting a new form of payment.

$5000 nest egg? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:23:31
Which won't ever happen, ever. Not even in the next few months. Buying it is a massive waste.

It's not China, BTC is pouring into the US right now. 34,000 in the last last 30 minutes.

Why would you call something meant to encourage newbies, Moronic Monday?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:54:04
Well. They did miss be boat as far as becoming a paper millionaire. Sure you can buy into a small portion but you're not going to get 10x returns in a few months again. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:04:47
My trading what?
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:47:11
Everyone has to pay taxes, so I'm not sure what point you're making. If everyone thinks they are going to get away with tax free money in bitcoins. They've got another thing coming. Society doesn't exist without taxation. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:27:37
So you're willing to risk the family business to raise awareness? Riiiiight. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:23:01
Explain to me how you expect governments to pay for services?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:09:22
Yes, you're mental with those ASIC miner ROI's. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:48:59
Because at this point, it's not. No matter how much the bitcoin fanboys want to believe. Right now, it's nothing more than a commodity being traded to make real cash. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:34:52
No it's actually less than that now. 5 bitcoins is about $4200. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:04:57
Mine altcoins, middlecoin.com
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:56:22
No it means they are riding the latest coat tails of bitcoins in the media. Just like most vendors right now. They don't care about bitcoin future, they care about making fiat money. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:21:53
The private sector doesn't pay for public services directly. It's from taxes. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:11:32
Except the point of bitcoin is that it's not physical money. Nothing like confusing the non technical.
