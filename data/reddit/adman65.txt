WTF IS THIS SHIT? I'm an expat living in Sweden. God fuck the US. This shit pisses me off.

I've been buying $50 a week for the past few months on coinbase. Set and ignore. Check back about once a month. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:02:07
Jesus. That's a big increase. I'd be surprised for sure!
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:45:57
Which one is that?
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:42:39
It will be interesting to see how it all plays out. Big banks and the existing monetary system will not go easily.

This was the best episode in the history of south park. The satire level is off the charts. I laughed my ass off the entire time.

I think they are being DDoS'd again right now. The site seems to be down.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:39:54
what is the PPC column?
@_date: 2013-11-08 10:38:51


This is more or less what I'm doing. $5 a day into BTC. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:27:30


2011 is the key there. Nice move :)

Change how currency works and you change the world. Cryptocurrencies are real powerful stuff. Fight the power!
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:51:37
We are in agreement. The longterm value of BTC is either insanely large or 0. There are no other outcomes. Can you think of anything else that has the same value proposition?
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:51:31
I completely agree with this. There either two things happening:
1. The bitcoin system suffered a massive multi site DDoS attack causing a panic sell. The increase in accounts was a way to do the DDoS attack. Now Mt.Gox either knows this, and is trying to spin it in a positive way. I don't understand why they would possibly do this. They don't know it was an attack and act like they are now.
2. It wasn't a DDos and they've proven they are, indeed, noobs incapable of running a popular exchange.
Either way, bye Mt.Gox. You guys are noobs.

what do you mean dollar cost average?
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:09:31
Ya that's is what concerns me. It seems primed to go up more ($100 ?!) or simply fall off a cliff.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:53:52
yes. I'm not verified yet. I was able to fund my account via bank transfer and buy in a day. Granted I had signed up for mtgox a while ago, but never used it. This was my first transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:13:23
ya, but now what :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:48:03
and the hold columns? Is that how much you're holding from your previous investment? Also, are you buying new BTC every month regardless of the price?
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:54:07
Why node? What about Erlang?
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:43:42
how are you buying LTC?
EDIT: Are you continually buying LTC?
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:15:52
I'm moving all funds away from them. They've proven to be noobs.
@_date: 2013-05-18 12:49:50
God damn.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:41:57
I was able to transfer to mtgox via my Bank of America account in one day. $45 fee but it worked out.

I could not read the wall of text so I formatted it a bit:
I am very new to Bitcoins, but I learned a lot from the dot.com crash and I see a lot of similarities. I’d like to share what I have learned as it applies to Bitcoins, for the new Bitcoin thousandaires. 
1. Do not spend more than you can afford to lose! For a good guide, imagine planning for a weekend in Vegas or a day at the track or a poker outing. What is the most that you would want to gamble? If you spent more than twice that much on Bitcoins, you may want to rethink your strategy. 
2. Have an exit strategy, a backup exit strategy, and test them out. Most people think this is a bubble, but I can tell you that if there isn’t a burst, there will be a correction. And the higher and faster things rise, the harder they fall. Once a correction is triggered, people will panic, and trading sites will be overloaded and even crash. trading sites may even go bankrupt. New accounts can be slow to be approved or delayed indefinitely. **This is why you should have at least 2 trading accounts made, and linked to a bank account. And test them, do a small trade.**
Imagine having 2000 Bitcoins, and it reaches $500. Then it starts falling, so you want to cash out at least half because you want to buy a house. It’s at 400, so you decide to sell. You register for a trading account. That takes a few hours to be approved. It’s at 350. You transfer Bitcoins. It takes 3 hours. 325. You make a trade. The site crashes before it’s done. 
Next day, it is back up, and we are at 275. You make the trade at 250. You could have had it at 350 had you registered. You finally get the money and have it transferred. Hey, $250,000 isn’t bad. But there is a transfer limit. You are not verified, so you transfer $10,000, the site’s daily limit. And you wait a week. And then you find out your bank does not accept transfers to savings accounts, only checking accounts. And by the time you fix this up, the trading site has gone bankrupt, and it takes you 3 years to finally get a claim in and get 20 cents on the dollar.
 Most could have been avoided by testing out the system with 0.1 Bitcoins. Now by all means, support Bitcoins, start using them for trades, and encourage vendors to accept them. This ‘bubble’ is only a small part of the big picture. But for those of you who have $40K in bitcoins and only $300 in your pocket, well, this advice is for you.

you need to get off coinbase and move to MtGox. You can fund it with dwolla if you like as well. Coinbase simply can't keep up with demand/is still a new business. I don't know they acquire coins anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:59:56
God damn. I'm sorry man. I cannot understand or fathom your loss. No words.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:47:00
This is just sad at this point.
