I'm pretty sure that it's only safari (on OSX) that does this.

They were supposed to send money to him. They claimed that they didn't want to hurt their image by association with him, so they wanted to send it through a  intermediary. They wanted to hide the source of the money (themselves) to avoid that association.

I don't think he would've mentioned that it automatically extracts if he had manually changed the settings to specifically do that...

If it is possible to predict future price from nothing but past performance, then we would already have handed that job over to the machines. The *reason* why simply feeding a neural network BTC price history as training data hasn't already created an agent that can predict future performance accurately is because there isn't enough of a statistical correlation between past and future performance. There are too many other factors that affect price/performance outside of past prices. Literally, if there was enough correlation then machine learning would've already uncovered it, because that's what it's really really REALLY good at.

Ether that or they mixed up their directions on the number line.

It doesn't relate at all. Some people just like to drop tangentially related facts because they think it makes them look smart. I imagine their thought process goes something like this:
\&gt; sees comment with keyword I recognize
\&gt; recently saw a Wikipedia or opinion article with this keyword
\&gt; must be talking about the same thing
\&gt; I'll show the world how well read I am by posting this unrelated source!
In this case it seems that the keywords are "America" and "young"... And the relation to your comment ends there.

Maybe instead of complaining about the parts of Reddit that you dislike (especially while being in the minority), you should either ignore it or leave.
Nobody is gonna change for you.

Do you want a cookie?

Sure. Go ahead and give me a polar equation for that graph.

The nugget mall - so basically right there.

Obvious condescension aside; what do you mean by this?

You're wrong.

That's what I'm going to do. Unfortunately I also have to withdraw a minimum of 0.1BTC. That'll take a while to mine haha

You are my first tip!
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:37:33
Graphs do. Functions don't.
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:08:31
Thanks for the advice! At this rate that will take me about 30 days, but it seems to be the only option.
+0.25 USD verify

No. That's the point; you can't. Even a three dimensional graph needs to pass the vertical line test to be a function.

Thank you. One more question, do you know how I can get the bitcoins that I already have in BTC-e out?
