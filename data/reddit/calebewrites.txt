Replace "Labour win" with "Conservative win but no majority." After that, we are in the same place as we are now.

You pay similar fees when buying bitcoin. Plus you and the other party have to go through the hassle of setting up accounts to convert BTC to/from fiat, then wait 20 mins for your transaction to process.  Paypal/ Venmo offer the same service with more convenience. I'm just saying.

To each his own. I've used BTC for several years, but I still rely on PayPal and Venmo for nearly all of my P2P transfers. They're just more convenient. The fact that BTC allows you to transfer money across borders is not a significant source of value, imo, because once you pay for the coins, account for possible price fluctuation, and pay transfer fees, there's a decent chance your fees are hitting &gt;3%. Plus it takes longer.

Look at [this]( [this]( and [this]( Compare them to [this] ( (be sure to click on the all time graph). This is what happens when a bubble pops. No one who lived through the former events thought that they were in a bubble either. Crypto will survive, but it's likely that the next few months will be very ugly.
