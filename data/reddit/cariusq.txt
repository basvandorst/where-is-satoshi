The thing about that survey is that it's on bitcoin page. There's a lot of selective bias with such an unscientific survey. Within China, 99% of people probably don't give a shit about bitcoin. Granted, even at 1% of Chinese population is still a lot of people. 


I really have problem with that statement. In my opinion, I don't really think bitcoin is currently a very good saving vehicle. The widely fluctuating bitcoin is only good for speculation. I'm also concern about liquidity of bitcoin "investment". What if, god forbidden, there's a 2008 style bitcoin crash. How likely would  you be able to convert your bitcoin into cash? 
I don't really think China would let bitcoin be significant part of remittance. The lessons of 1997 Asian Financial Crisis still haunted Chinese central bankers. I don't think China would even loosen their tight control of capital. 
I'm not saying that bitcoin is worthless. There's definitely a value but unfortunately it's in currently in greed and manic phase. Why do people purchase bitcoin now? Because the value will go up! How's that different from mid-2000 mantra that real estate value will always go up?

Unfortunately, all subreddits start to decay if there is no heavy moderation. This is a known reddit problem. One of top stories on this subreddit now is about an eight grader's homework. Seriously?   I'll look for smaller subreddits.

Goddamn, everybody in this place is delusional. Reddit circlejerk at its best. Hao123 is NOT, I repeat, IS NOT, accepting bitcoin. The bitcoin page on Hao123 is not thing more than information portal. It's not that different from Yahoo Finance adding a page for a new currency.
Did you see the little survey on the right-hand side? Of course not. Lemme translate it for you.
 1. Are you going to use, or have used bitcoin for purchase?
-No. 70.67% (5706 vote)  
-Yes, but won't hold for long term. 14.57%( 1,189 vote)  
-Yes, and will use it for long term. 14.77% (1,205 vote)   
 2. Do you think bitcoin is a bubble   
-Yup. It looks like a bubble. 73.73% (6,009 vote)  
-Nope, it's an investment.  17.18% (1,400 vote)   
-Don't know. 9.09% (741 vote)  
 3. Do you think there going to other cyptocoin replacing bitcoin in the -future?   
-Yes, more and more copycatcoin will appear. 61.38 (5,029vote)   
-No. Bitcoin is special. 15.57% 1,276 vote  
-Don't know.     23.04% 1,888 vote   
tldr; stop circlejerk each other with trival news.

You don't seem to understand the meaning of circlejerk in context of reddit. One person by definition, can't be circlejerking. Circlejerking is an emerging behavior from a group that's intolerant of other viewpoints. After lurking this subreddit for the past few days, I have to conclude this whole place is a giant circlejerk of trival bitcoin news. If you don't at least diversify your news sources you'll be living in an information bubble that will impair your judgment to make an objective decision.

You still don't seem to understand the concept of circlejerk. Is Hao123 accepting bitcoin? No. Then why was this a news-worthy event? This whole community is bitcoin-mad. Any publicity, no matter how trivial, got upvoted. 
May I recommend for some reading assignments on "Filter Bubble"?

OK. So what did you learn from 50hrs of reading? 
Can you summarize for us?
