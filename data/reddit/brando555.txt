Yeah, until Lightning starts gaining traction I like to think of it as an extended BTC holiday sale :)
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:35:51
Yeah I gotta look into that too.  Checked out all the incoming connections and it seems like the newer 15.1 nodes that are most likely still syncing use a ton of bandwidth. I was sending out over 4gb each hour to a few of them.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:58:07
I think they felt that high fees were killing their business. Encouraging people to swap sides and go to Bcash was better for their business model.
Segwit and lightning will have some growing pains, but Bcash is just kicking the can down the road imho.

I have been trying to get this to work, but for the life of me I can't figure it out.
I have the Bitcoin Core testnet up and running and synced. Put all my testnet coins in a segwit address, created the .conf files for both Bitcoin Core and Eclair but everytime I try to run it I get this message "Could not connect to Bitcoin Core with JSON-RPC, Make sure Bitcoin Core is running and RPC Parameters are correct"
I'm not sure what I'm missing here.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:01:28
You don't spend when the price is going up astronomically each week like we saw this past year, lol. But look at the price of gold or silver, silver has been hovering around $16-17 forever, gold has been around $1300 or so. I think if BTC ever stabilizes like gold or silver, people won't be so hesitant to spend.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:26:00
Lol yeah, they're still growing. The only customers they're losing are the ones that get embroiled in all the twitter and reddit cryptodrama.

@_date: 2018-01-21 03:17:46
... and broadcasting every silly little $1.00 transaction to the whole network is? Segwit + Lightning is superior to a simple blocksize increase in every way. It gives incentive to use lightning for small transactions, and reserve the main chain for larger transactions. Suddenly a $4 fee for a .01 BTC transaction isn't such a huge deal.  At some point fees will be the only incentive to mine. Who's going to mine for BCH when the block reward is next to nothing?

Given the option, I would still buy directly from Ledger before ebay or Amazon. Shipping is a little more expensive, but it is quick. Both times I've ordered from them they've shipped from France to the states and I've gotten them in about one week.
There are a few legit sellers on Amazon though, and I believe as long as you create the seed yourself and verify that the device is legit you should be okay.

@_date: 2018-01-06 02:42:09
Yeah you can always build a simple GPU mining rig and join a mining pool. Monero, Ether, Zcash and a few others are quite a bit easier to mine than BTC.
There are mining calculators that can estimate what you would make based on your setup's hashing power.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:55:18
Probably, I've seen them on ebay for $119. I paid a lot less directly from Ledger.

@_date: 2018-01-05 22:04:35
It's basically just a fork of the "old" Bitcoin, with bigger blocks and no segwit. Fees are dirt cheap, which is one of the main selling points by BCH shills... however fees are only cheap because no one uses it. Plus, BTC Tx fees are actually reasonable if you use segwit addresses and wallets, but people keep using legacy addresses and complaining about fees instead.

Yeah, exactly. His internet analogy hit the nail on the head. Bcash really is like the internet without tcp/ip. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:01:07
BitPay sucks though. There's no incentive to pay in Bitcoin when you go to check out and their "exchange rate" is way lower than the actual BTC exchange rate.
I went to pay with BTC for some items last week when BTC was trading at $14,100 on Coinbase, and BitPay's exchange rate was about $800 lower.
To me, a third party that gets a piece of the pie just defeats the whole purpose of Bitcoin imo.

Lightning Network is a layer built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead of recording each transaction to the blockchain, you're able to use payment channels to make instant, dirt cheap transactions while still maintaining the integrity of a decentralized network.

That would be ridiculous, but imho I don't see why cryptos can't hang with the gold or precious metal market. That would put right around $250,000ish per BTC.

I agree, I would just pay the taxes. The IRS has no statute of limitations on civil penalties for tax fraud. Plus, if you held for &gt; 1 year before you sold or made a profit there's a good chance you won't owe that much anyway. Not trying to sound like a bootlicker, it's just we don't know how hard they'll try to clamp down on people not paying on crypto gains. They've already gone after Coinbase's records who knows what else they'll try.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:45:23
I think the rough estimate is about 25% of mined coins have been burned or are stuck in a wallet somewhere, or in a hard drive at the bottom of the landfill.
You can also check out "days destroyed" on one of the block explorers and it will give a rough idea what kind of coins are being moved around. New coins vs. coins that have been sitting in a wallet for a long time.

"Most people believe that until they become an expert in a particular field, and realise that most journalists have no fucking clue what they're talking about."
I see that a lot. People that sound really well-versed on a particular subject, but at some point you realize they are essentially just generalizing and parroting a bunch of popular ideas and opinions and don't really have any in-depth, hands on knowledge at all. I think thats why there's so much bullshit out there. People try to sound like an expert, but they're really just doing themselves a disservice.

Here's another one I've been pondering... with capital gains from crypto do you have the option of LIFO vs FIFO? Cost averaging?

It's always the same old rhetoric too. "Where's this Lightning network at?"    
"They've been talking about it for over a year now. Why isn't it ready?"   
"Just use Bcash, it's cheaper, faster, and it's the real deal original Satoshi approved Bitcoin"
But you  just can't rush stuff like this! There's a lot of thought that goes into a system where a ton of people's money is at stake.
So, I don't mind. If people want to sell off their BTC for Bcash, I'll buy some more discounted BTC :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:50:24
I was using Electrum then went with the Nano S and really like it. It's super easy to use and I like the fact that it's about the same size as a  USB memory stick.

The fees really piss me off. My kids both had a savings account with maybe 200 bucks each. When we moved, the bank kept sending out statements, and charging a 5 dollar return mail fee. Since the account was opened by my dad, he was the contact person but he had also moved in the meantime so they had no way to get ahold of anyone. I know it was partially our fault for not notifying the bank ahead of time, but we had a lot going on between getting settled into the new place and having two young kids at the time.

High fees are to ensure miners are getting paid and to keep small transactions from clogging up the blockchain. There's no need for every $2.00 purchase to be recorded to the blockchain when payment systems like Lightning are in place.

I remember when everyone jumped on the alt train, purely for the fact that there was more room for gains. I always thought that was dumb since most alts will eventually go belly up. I'm sticking with BTC, it has the most developers working on new projects, hashing power, and it's actually accepted as payment at several places. I've got about 99% BTC and the rest is a small amount of ETH and XMR.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:59:08

Same here, I recall being very sketchy about BTC back then. Just about the same way I felt about PayPal when it was new, lol. "Wait, I'm supposed to trust sending money to a random stranger on the internet???"
@_date: 2018-10-02 20:32:56
Pretty sure you still can, although it only works if your stuff is sold and shipped from Newegg and not their other suppliers. Also, iirc Bitcoin doesn't show up as a payment method until you start the checkout process.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:21:30

Silver has been terrible, but I've still been buying a little here and there. I see $30+ a real possibility in the near future, even with crypto being preferred by many over metals.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:10:05
I think Coinbase is a good starting point. It's pretty easy to use, and you can send funds straight from your bank. From there you can transfer your coins to something like Trezor or Electrum for safekeeping.

Yeah, if you have some bullshit major but you're going to need some college if you want to be a nurse or a teacher or most of the STEM type jobs. If you know what you want to do, then taking a chunk of debt for a $100,000/yr job is worth it.
If you have a valuable skill like carpentry, electrician, CNC, etc.. you're better off finding an entry level job or apprenticeship and getting whatever certifications as you go. I have a cousin that found work with a plumber right out of highschool, he worked his way up to Journeyman, then finally got his Master Plumber's license a few years ago and runs his own business making some pretty good $$$ doing large jobs like condos and new homes.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:37:37
Mine was the same way. I told her last year after she got her tax return to stick a couple hundred into bitcoin, but she wasn't having any of it. So I finally set up a Mycellium wallet on her tablet and sent her .1 btc a few months ago and now she checks that shit everday, lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:32:44
Bitcoin is one of those things where you're naturally skeptical... but once you open a wallet, send some coins around, buy something with it, etc etc... thats when you go "Aha!"

Richard Heart made a good point about that in one of his recent videos. Going long on BTC is the safe bet. People trying to short BTC usually get screwed hard. A lot of times they get stuck on a short and have to cover, then basically it turns into a huge buy order that continues to drive the BTC price up.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:30:13

You know 1 Bitcoin is divisible up to 100,000,000 times right? You can buy 5 bucks worth if you want.
edit: One smaller purchase every week usually works out better than saving up for a year to make one big purchase. You can set up automatic weekly buys on Coinbase.

Kinda bummed I don't show up as a dot on the map anymore :(    I've got everything set up correctly, I've usually got around 20 connections though.

I'd recommend Electrum. They have wallets for all of those coins.
It's as easy as
* Download &amp; Run
* Set up new wallet
* Write down 12 word phrase ( DO NOT LOSE IT!) I keep a copy in my wallet and another in a safe. If you forget your password, or your computer bricks, you can always download electrum again and regenerate your wallet from the 12 word seed.
* Click on receive tab, copy address. Go to Coinbase and send your coins to the address you just copied.

It's easy to do. Just open your bitcoin.conf file and add the following:
maxuploadtarget = [X number in megabytes]
maxuploadtarget = 1000 (1000 would be 1GB, etc.)
IIRC you have to create the bitcoin.conf file. Just open your Bitcoin Core folder and create a new notepad document, then save it as bitcoin.conf

Most likely, anything with at least Windows 7 and a 1gig of ram should be okay. You'll also need at least 150gb of storage.

Yeah, old habits die hard. He was a product of the depression. People from his generation are thrifty, billionaire or not. Just my observation anyway.

Hopefully it doesn't go like "I  poured my whole life savings into bitcoin, and all I have left is this stupid medallion"  ;)

routerlogin.net if you have a netgear router
then you go to port forwarding on the side tab, select the ip address for your device and enter in 8333 for the port
You'll know it's working if you get more than 8 connections

Running a node is different from mining. With a node you're only helping verify transactions, so unlike miners you don't get paid through fees and block rewards. A full node doesn't use nearly as much electricity as mining though which is a plus. Iirc, it's maybe $100 a year in a electricity to run a full node.
To run a full node you need to download Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 from  bitcoin.org  and configure your router to accept connections from other nodes through port 8333
Your node is also rather secure wallet, much better than any online wallet. So if you have coins on an exchange or online wallet you can store them in Bitcoin Core wallet for more peace of mind.

Yeah, if you go back and read a lot of what he has said over the past year or so, this whole "Bcash is the real Bitcoin" thing is a complete farce.

I thought the largest blocks allowed were 2mb??? Or are you saying a 2mb segwit block is equal to a 4mb legacy block???

I suppose technically you could call it 1/4 of a Satoshi :)

Not so fast, go read the comments on their videos. Lots of naive people that take whatever they say as gospel because they have some cool cars and talk like savvy businessmen.

Download and install Bitcoin Core version v0.15.0.1
Make sure your ISP doesn't have any data caps, you'll need to download the entire blockchain which is about 150gb. It takes a while, iirc it took a couple days with my 40mbps broadband connection.
You'll also need to configure your router to accept incoming connections through port 8333.
Just google "running a full node" if you get stuck, there's a few threads on here with a bunch of good info.

@_date: 2017-10-20 20:53:50
Just a random thought I had, but what if-
Satoshi wanted to come out, but the people around him knew it wouldn't be a good idea because he'd probably be demonized by the media and/or general public and it could just be a complete disaster. So someone did it for him just to demonstrate that he wouldn't be greeted with open arms and ticker tape parades. Craig Wright did it in a way that was convincing, but only convincing enough for an initial reaction. Eventually people smart enough would figure out that he wasn't really Satoshi.
Am I smoking crack? or is this within the realm of possibility?

$1.04 million gets you a 2 bd, 2 bath 1500 sq/ft home in Oakland
$649k for a 5 bed, 4 bath 4200 sq/ft mansion on private lake in Northern Wi

"\[Bernie Madoff\] made the fundamental mistake of stealing from rich people"      Lol, so true.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:57:32
True, but there's ways around this. As long as you have a wallet, many people are willing to buy BTC for those that don't want the trouble of signing up to Coinbase or wherever.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:02:05
You get a wallet that's more secure than a online wallet. Plus it's cool to look at the map on   and be like "Hey that's me" lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:49:23
I noticed this too. Why are so many people still running Satoshi 0.14.1 and 0.14.2? Is there any reason to other than neglecting to update to 0.15.x?
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:02:37
Probably most of the people on this sub.
"Dude, I just bought .05 BTC!    Lambos, hookers and blow, bitches!!!"  lol

What Happened to Bitcoin?
The Bitcoin Core (BTC) network is in trouble due to high fees and slow transaction times. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the upgrade that solves these problems.

He holds BTC because he still loves BTC and wants it to succeed. Bcash is just his little money grab/ego trip side project. At least thats what I suspect anyway.

@_date: 2017-05-05 02:41:06
Yeah, traditionally a house is thought of as an investment. Property usually appreciates in value, unlike a car, and a lot of people end up selling their house for a decent profit especially if they did a lot of improvements over the years. But I get what you're saying, a house isn't *always* a good investment. If you buy a house and let it sit for 30 years doing nothing more than paying property taxes and utilities you could end up lucky to break even if you need a new roof, windows, etc...

Yep, I think a lot of people still thinking of BTC like its a stock. Like how certain stocks will tank over the course of a week and then take months to climb back up.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:55:43
I tried "Day trading" ETH and while I did make a  profit I wish I would have just hodl'd. I think it's safe to say BTC isn't going anywhere, $1800 last week was just a discount :)

I agree, it's worth transfering it just for the sake of learning how to store your coins outside of an exchange. I just transfered all of mine to Electrum. I liked the idea of Trezor, but Electrum is free and pretty straight forward.
