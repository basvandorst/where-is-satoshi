Ah nice. Are you the proprietor? I've been to the site before. Where do the products ship from?
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:56:31
Interesting. Anyone use it? Is it safe, does it work?

Wait there's r/teenagers? What are common topics? Is it just creepy 35 year olds?

Also, are you an Authorized Canon dealer?

Here's the simplest graphic version

Designer here: WAY too much to digest via text. Infographics should be like skittles... you shouldn't have to think to digest it.

Sorry if I'm missing the obviousness but why would it be good to have "unconfirmed transactions?"
@_date: 2013-02-16 07:03:48
Friday night and had time to think about it. Also had finally decided on a wallet after lots of reading. Next step is to buy a few coin. Trying to figure out the best way to do that.
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:25:52
:-) Love it thanks
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:13:59
Ah, and I felt so proud. Good luck to you.

First time coinbase user, I'm astounded at how slow this transaction is. What are the alternatives?
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:24:50
Great, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-02-22 21:48:24
Does this require a Bank of America account?
@_date: 2013-03-01 16:25:54
This is much more comforting to look at but I'm unclear what the difference of a logarithmic and linear scale?
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:13:29
Is that... 50 coins each?

Random, but I need 3 more comment Karma to get my stupidly small bitcointip karma redemption. Any upvotes please?

Can I use Coinbase to exchange USD to BTC but get that BTC directly to my Blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:21:49
That's what my post was about. I just got a Blockchain wallet and it's great!

Is it worth pre-ordering a Single "SC" at this point?
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:05:54
[It exists]( :-)
@_date: 2013-02-18 00:26:53
ah damn. could one do multiple transactions or is it a daily limit?
@_date: 2013-02-18 01:35:48
Shit is there anyway around this? There really isn't anyone reasonable on localbitcoins.com and I can't seem to find any other way to fund an account fast. $500 is so low...
@_date: 2013-02-07 18:05:05
Sad, thanks for the response though. 
@_date: 2013-02-18 02:56:25
What kind of limits are there to this beautiful machine? $100? $1,000?

His conclusion:

My question about the ASIC's is once they become substantially less productive, nay inversely productive, what do you do with it? Turn it off? is there a secondary use or *any* worth to these things?
@_date: 2013-02-18 01:19:44
Not that I can figure out...
