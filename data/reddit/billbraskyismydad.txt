Bitcoin will most likely be over-regulated and shutdown by world governments to protect their own fiat, so no probably not.

It all makes sense now.

What's a safe percentage of your paycheck to invest in bitcoin each month?

Dude if you know anyone who can hook me up with that gig let me know LOL. I'm just speaking from what I know, which is obviously not everything, so if you have anything you could educate me on like why bitcoin was invented I would love to know.

Bitcoin is a valuable ledger system but by no means will it go past 19 again, it's just not worth that much. We will never really know how much bitcoin is worth till its practicality is shown in mainstream economies.

It has value, but as we all know, it's not widely used, therefore extremely hard to value.

Probably should have rephrased that better, but the shortcomings that bitcoin has. Not every company or consumer needs a blockchain ledger, along with some other issues. My main gripe is believing that bitcoin is "too big to fail".

I was thinking in terms of consumer business accepting bitcoin transactions. I think at that point we will really get an accurate valuation. But right now it's purely experimental for large corporations and financial firms.

Because it helps the narrative they want to promote.

I think you make very valid points. Price swings are to be expected to be sure. I probably made that too much of a focal point for this post.
I work in an industry that builds blockchain solutions so I have a fair understanding of the market and its shortcomings though Haha. 
The interesting thing about bitcoin is that its value is entirely predicated on the success of the underlying technology, if immutable ledgers are adapted and become mainstream, I would have no doubt that standard cycalical price movements would exist. 
The reason bitcoin is volatile is due to:
1. Consumer and business bubbles due to uncertainaity about BTC's value.
2. The lack of implementation and speculation on whether it will be implemented.

I don't think trading is that difficult. You just need to be able to understand the market you are trading in. Bitcoin is a bubble market for the mean time and you should expect a massive rise for a short amount of time, but when that first major drop hits you better sell like crazy because it ain't going to stop until all the get rich quick guys sell all their holdings. The HODL'rs are who support the crypto right now. But when it levels out I would always buy more BTC just because these bubbles will continue until one day bitcoin will finally have some kind of widespread, common implementation with a steady market. Can't say if that level will be below or above where we are at now though.

I bought at 5,800 and had no idea this would happen, so happy. I'm thinking it will start to cap at around 10-15 though, no way it will go past the inflated value from awhile ago.

It was hyberpole, but a lot of people sure do make it seem that way.
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:17:10
I addressed that in the post, it has a lot of intrinsic value potential, just needs to be implemented in more mainstream markets. 
My issue is just the hostility and defensiveness that comes from bringing up any issues with bitcoin. Need to be able to talk about those issues in a healthy way in a sub about bitcoin.

Never bet everything on anything, invest what you can afford to lose, not everything you have.
