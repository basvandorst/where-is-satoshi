The transaction is confirmed by a miner and is in the chain tip, however the fee is sort of lucrative. It is profitable and sensible for them to attempt to reorg out the top block and steal it for themselves.

Satoshi consensus is that the longest *valid* chain wins, otherwise a miner can have a good shot as making a block in the longest chain which pays them 1 million BTC out of thin air.

There would be none unless SHA256 is broken, there's no requirement for changing the nonce at all while mining even (but you'd be silly not to, it's the cheapest block mutation by far).

You could only be talking about `bitcoin-ruby`, which was written almost exclusively by [mhanne]( and [lianj]( The other attempts at consensus complete implementations are [bitcoinj]( and [btcd](

You can say "that's probably what's going on", but nothing more than that.

Yes. Very often it's more profitable to not mine on the tip of the chain. As the block reward drops, it will be more profitable to steal other peoples transaction fees than it is to advance the chain.

If 75% of the hash rate decide to mine blocks with a 1000 BTC output paying themselves, then it is both longest and invalid according to the consensus rules.

It attempts to be consensus complete for at least validation of blocks and scripts, it's the basis for Toshi (a full node that keeps 700GB of address keyed indexes in Postgres) and webbtc (a block explorer). It was on the receiving end of a number of [consensus implementation forks]( and seems to have lost some popularity due to that.

Please provide a citation of this. There was no such "urging".

You're right.

Pruning only removes blocks on disk which are never touched in normal operation anyway. The only change with a pruned node is that the usage on disk is lowered, the amount of IO is the same. 
The description of pruning in the bitcoin whitepaper is not what has been implemented, there's no storage of merkle trees or anything like that. There's no point in what was described there as there is now a significantly more efficient UTXO store.

It's mostly meaningless for JoinMarket anyway, if anybody manages to double spend today the system is protected. You can't exit the join without all participants signing the transaction and all of the inputs being valid, so a double spend is at most a minor annoyance and not a theft. If somebody wants to be annoying, the system can just sign a new transaction and continue on. 
Given the default settings for JoinMarket include one which takes 6 hours it's completely irrelevant.

You can edit your transactions on the fly, which is "compression" in some use cases. 
Imagine we are an exchange that is making payouts, we've just made a transaction to users A, B, C, only before it has confirmed D wants to make a withdrawal as well, we can replace our original transaction with a new one that pays all four at once. What would normally have to be multiple transactions become one, and the "batching" of transactions exchanges and services use now isn't needed anymore.

When the limit was added there was a flaw in the Bitcoin client which meant that the block size was actually undefined, it was implied by some of the networking rules but not stated. The rules were different for when you were importing blocks from disk versus seeing them over the network.
When this was added "large" miners didn't exist, it was 2011 and the idea of pooled mining with CPUs and GPUs was just being developed.
