@_date: 2017-12-14 09:08:14
This guy is so crazy I wonder why some people follow him, it's just a fraud like his bcash

Send them an email where you explain to them that they can go fuck themselves for that inactivity fee and then shut down your account.

I didn't said he was a good person, just that he only created a website and that he didn't deserve that exagerated sentence.
Personnaly I got nothing against drugs, I think they should almost all be legal, so for me that guy shouldn't be in jail at all and the US justice system is ultra-shit** (it got already proven many times sadly ...)

What can we do to help Ross ?
@_date: 2019-02-18 11:33:55
Yeah I know and it's very wrong, justice should be always the same logically.

@_date: 2019-02-14 10:19:16
What's the problem ? He should have taken 2 to 5 years max obviously he just created a website dude.
@_date: 2019-02-05 13:00:27
Why would people farm karma actually ?
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:51:02
Haha indeed I forgot thoses :D
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:57:04

Why is spaceX even allowed to do that ? There is already a fucking graveyard orbiting earth that might make us be stuck on earth for a while  and they wants to add fucking 12k satelites just for wifi ??
