I agree with this. Its made investing in crypto easy for beginners. Whenever i've had any issues with them, it might have taken time but they were always resolved.

external HD might help and they're not that expensive.

will i ever be able to pay for a coffee without paying like 2x the amount in transaction fees? Is the lightning network thing going to help with this?

a storm is coming.

I'm going to try to contribute in whatever way i can. I am a developer and hope i can have some bug fixed to my name!
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:00:56
ahh, so it's some sort of 'clubbing' mechanism where it will club mine (and other coffee transactions) into one transaction. Is that a correct assessment?

Its been maybe a week now and it says just 53%. Progress increase per hour just 0.14% with an estimated 2 weeks left! Is it normal for the blockchain to take this long to download for other folks too? BTW I have a 35mbps download speed.

I started as a newbie so coinbase seemed to be the best bet! Maybe going forward a hardware wallet would be a better idea.
I am hoping in 5 months we hear about just one of these two! If there are 2 currencies floating around it will only add to confusion and whole perception will take a beating.

^ That experience sounds like mine. My machine is [AMD Quad-Core A6-3400M 1.4GHz, 4GB DDR3, 500GB HDD].

Disk transfers / sec is basically at a 100% all the time (while syncing). I tried seeing what happens to the tps while downloading a file of the internet but it was nowhere close to 100%.
Yeah, this seems to be very IO intensive

Started running a node awhile back to support the network. Was curious if there big advantage to the network if i upgraded to 0.15.1 as opposed to stay on 0.15.0.1 (which i am running now) for awhile?
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:41:21
isn't this something for mining setups only?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:40:41
This is truly incredible!

i've tried to get lightning to work on testnet for awhile now (without success). Could someone suggest any forum/subreddit where folks could get help with issues?
@_date: 2018-03-24 02:21:16
This still seems to come up-to ~0.81% fees. Any idea if that's a good average? or would it vary greatly on mainnet.

I setup bitcoin testnet + eclair. I even see my node in the [acinq explorer]( however i'm getting errors when trying to setup a channel using  From 'not connected to node' to 'min channel size c350 sat' (despite trying to setup channel with minimal funds).
I came accross this [link]( that states:-
"Currently, the TLF is only compatible with lnd, but in the near future as the other Lightning implementations (eclair, c-lightning, lit, and more) become available, our hope is that the faucet will also be usable with these active implementations." 
Does TLF work with eclair at this point? What could be the reason for errors i am getting.

Finally got my first transaction (albeit on testnet) to go through! yay!
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:41:35
I would like to do something similar. Could some folks suggest a safe way to generate a paper wallet with this amount?
