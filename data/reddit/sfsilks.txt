Not so crazy in my opinion
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:06:50
Thats what they said about bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:44:07
OK get it now
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:28:50
Get a life I have been involved in bitcoin for over 4years, so do not tell me to suck eggs. And for your info there is no mention of fees on there website
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:29:35
I am assuming there is still the fee though as it is a miners fee?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:32:03
As far as I can see there is no way to move without a fee unless GDAX reimburses the fee so I am sure they di not do that
@_date: 2015-12-04 07:29:47
Glad you picked up on this, as I am a fan but need you to be right to continually recommened
@_date: 2015-12-04 07:25:52
I was trying to do it for them and I have been in bitcoin since 2011, so if I struggled you can see why I have an issue. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:01:58
Cheers for that, will advice in future. I wonder though how many people get caught this way each day
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:14:09
Just to add to this he is apparently the Chief digital and product officer, I cannot believe he doesn't know about bitcoin as a means of micro payment, which in essence is the one major advantage of digital currencies. I think we ought to let him know
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:08:43
That doesn't make sense unless you mean have two bank account one in the UK and one is Spain but then you have charges for both etc etc
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:07:01
PS never seen it so flat!
@_date: 2014-08-04 08:34:46
Simple I am an expat with a Spanish account now in the UK on work and I get hammered on exchange fees here in the UK. Second transferring money from PayPal to my Spanish account has to be done by Thursday otherwise my wife may not have any cash at the weekend. So I have opened a euro account for her so she can have cash instantly because I can now convert all my cash into bitcoin and transfer what she needs instantly. The only negative is the bitcoin price. There is no fee to buy in the currency the card is denominated in and the monthly fee seems to be fair for a great service. 
To expect a brilliant service like this to be completely free you must be mad, a fair price is a fair price.
Without this bitcoin in its current state is useless to me, finally we have a step which makes it usable while we wait fr bitcoin to become main stream.
I finally do not need to hold € or £
And what you are missing is Xapo is just one step closer to our objective and I would like to see you try to get something like this off the ground with no capital
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:18:04
Exactly I am an expat so for me it is obvious why bitcoin must succeed. I use PayPal completely and to be honest I can see them using it too, it makes sense. I think there is a lot of over reaction by both parties and that is why it is fascinating and emotional. All I can say is until you have been exploited by the banks, you will not grasp the reason why!
@_date: 2014-06-07 10:13:07
If he is a friend send him a couple of pounds worth, so he can try the experience because you are not selling
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:05:40
Well that is the figure I came up with from blockchain.info 0.0001
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:33:04
No because it takes days to transfer money, when it should be instant
@_date: 2014-11-10 09:14:56
I was sent this to post on my blog, obviously did not post but the data is very interesting it just shows you how expensive it is to accept credit cards or mobile payments. They have no idea, I replied and said would not post as they had not included bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:25:37
Hi lems2 the opposite will actually happen, basically to get out of mtgox you have to buy bitcoin. What will happen is people will think more about security and safety of their coins. Eventually it will settle and it would not surprise me if most buyers are waiting to pick up more coins cheap 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:09:55
Well I think it is FUD in that it is unimportant
@_date: 2014-06-28 15:26:30
Cheers will do
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:01:11
In some ways I agree, but when you do not earn a lot you do the best you can and as you say it is a hiccup. Not the end of the world just frustrating. The positive now is if I or my wife needs some cash I could still use bitcoin via localbitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:10:15
Speak for yourself
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:09:13
Yes my problem too, so used to an iphone had one of the very first when they arrived in Europe
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:54:00
Very good have a pat-on-the-back from me @_date: 2014-10-30 07:55:49
Those who complain about bitcoin, I see Barclays are much better at ripping us off
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:56:24
Funny enough I felt the same and also I had a slightly different idea. 
Why not add your details and give me some feed back, still more work but I think you will get the idea
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:13:43
Yes the truth is generally we do not pay any attention to it, but because I now understand bitcoin I pay more notice to how we are being ripped off.
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:26:48
I see you get it
@_date: 2014-08-04 12:36:31
PS you guys need a reality check
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:02:34
I am sorry you are missing the point, so long as my business is not illegal then it is not relevant 
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:54:11
Yes you could argue that, but when you do not have much it is hard to juggle, lesson learnt though
@_date: 2014-05-13 07:42:18
Good point I only discovered the ability to tip a couple of days back and then said I would tip anyone that would tweet my website. The funny thing was that most people here tipped me instead. It was great but I do not need convincing if that makes sense I am a convert
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:02:59
Not sure if I understand?
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:04:58
Yes but they are few and far between, so you would not use if you live in Spain
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:27:38
PS just in case you are interested I am based in Granada and offer a UK proxy at  and charge bitcoins NB have done for two years
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:04:37
It is a crazy old world I have been telling people about bitcoin since they were about $20 a coin. No one bought then or now.
Out of 5k people I have offered my proxy service to and accepted bitcoin as a donation only 2 people have sent me anything.
I am beginning to think Max Kieser got it right, everyone will want a bit when it reaches a $1000 again
As far as I can tell a lot of the talent associated with bitcoin are here in the UK, but very few people are using it. Just think what will happen when people finally get it
@_date: 2014-06-28 15:55:56
Thanks for sharing that, very interesting and I have had that experience of down voting just for sounding my experiences so I can understand your frustrations and I enjoy your publications. It never ceases to surprise me how negative people can be, we the people have been given an opportunity to take back control. We all have complained about the banks and now we have an alternative I cannot see why we don't all embrace it. Not sure if you know the phrase you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink it
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:13:39
Thanks for comment, yes these things happen and yes there are ways around it, but it does help at the time when you get caught. In the UK many cannot see the point of Bitcoin but if you travel get taken for a ride transfer money from one country to another (Small amounts) you sit here and really get it (which is why I bought in 2 years ago)
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:06:04
Missed the programme too, I am in the uk but if anyone needed a proxy let me know. I have accepted bitcoin for 2 years now and only 3 people out of 7k have donated in bitcoin would you believe. Anyway the website is  but will sort tomorrow for those who are interested
@_date: 2014-08-04 07:29:07
Thank god some humour on this subredditt, I was begging to lose the will to live lol
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:16:21
I am sorry I do not mean to be argumentative, just fed up with people saying it is banned. The truth is people my not accept it but banned is actually the wrong terminology. Banned is really a result of using and then being arrested for it!
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:14:52
@_date: 2014-07-24 11:33:37
You can use mine  but let me know you want the VPN rather than the proxy
@_date: 2014-05-11 11:58:57
Please take this 1 internet as a thank you @_date: 2014-10-02 10:49:33
That is because it is happening
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:16:54
Thanks for some humour in this space lol. I can confirm I still have mine and got my off mtgox the day before the shut down too
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:49:58
Well if you read the recent post from the CEO of Skype you will understand where I am coming from. And if you read my comments I do not want to criticize bitcoin I am emphasizing that regulation has the potential to kill the beauty of what we have here
@_date: 2014-09-27 18:30:51
I have been running my proxy service for over 4 years and a VPN service and have accepted bitcoin for quite a few years although only had 4 people have payed me in bitcoin so far Anyway address is 
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:08:18
Maybe you are right ;)
@_date: 2014-05-11 10:14:47
interesting will have a play with this too
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:30:52
good point to strong a term
@_date: 2014-05-11 10:04:15
Just to add thanks for the answer @_date: 2014-04-19 14:42:23
Because the exchange is not volatile, although the prices is. Also the price volatility is coming down. I am not saying it is perfect yet but you can do the exchange and incur no charges. Rather than paying nearly 25% through the banks
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:48:21
we are talking about 3p compared to 50p with Paypal as an example, so finally you could buy a news paper for 25p rather than have to buy a month or annual subscription. Makes much more sense to people who just buy a paper at the weekend etc etc
@_date: 2014-08-02 10:46:30
Because you cannot use bitcoin in the UK is a good reason for me so I cannot wait. Saying that you have good points and this is just a step towards our goal, not perfect but until it is accepted everywhere this is the best way for now
@_date: 2014-04-30 18:09:29
Humour much needed at time on this reddit
@_date: 2014-10-02 10:51:19
Firstly I am testing the debit card secondly because my money is either in euro pounds or euros and thirdly I am supporting the system
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:40:16
Sorry but would not work for me, as there is no transfer fee in using PayPal
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:14:55
Well if you cannot see the relevance you need help
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:29:04
Well looks like I know where I will be taking my holidays
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:04:33
Hi thanks for this very surprised, nice idea!
@_date: 2014-11-14 12:11:29
Would be great if the tipping function would work tried a day ago and today still cannot tip
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:11:32
Yep it is actually brilliant, particularly as it is connected to my coinbase account too. I was amazed how smooth it was.
I just have to reiterate, as a bitcoin user expat heave PayPal user to me bitcoin is an obvious winner, just cannot understand why some people do not get it!
@_date: 2014-05-11 09:59:38
good point though it is not obvious
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:01:52
Hi David, I am in Manchester at the moment, just took a look at your website some fantastic sculptures. I am in the process of building a website called  the idea was for charities and small businesses in Africa and India etc, but maybe it would work with any small business in truth!
I have not really started to promote as still working on but maybe worth adding your details if you want. Sometimes these things take a natural path!
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:08:12
Very true but you work within the rules you have at the time, now if I had known they would have closed my overdraft without asking then I could have worked with it. I was naive at the time
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:18:23
Exactly the only problem with buffers is the wife doesn't know what it is there for lol
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:51:02
I did look at this but couldn't or not worth it as I have a Spanish account and in the UK and doesn't help my wife who is in Spain and cannot get any cash out this weekend
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:26:08
Well said, bit tired of all these old comments about this. I am not in the finance industry but and expat running a business so it is obvious to me too. Time will tell, no idea why people want to criticize it so much so to those who do not believe in it stop wasting your time here do something more productive and enjoy life and get some fresh air
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:07:44
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:18:11
Well just shows you what you know nothing!!!
I am looking forward to the card solves so many issues for me
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:54:38
That is the point shouldn't they say what is the reason is it my location or is it my business
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:04:10
Down voted as of course they should not accept bitcoin, as this would enable under age drinking. As credit cards show that the customer is over the correct age.
Saying that the beauty of bitcoin for the future is you can stop your kids using the coins for certain products if you want.
I also feel your title is just sensationalism too
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:46:12
Interesting but no Spanish bank there, but I will be interested to know what exchange rate they apply
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:59:37
Yes at some point I will look into but it is not worth it at the moment and misses the point really as the cost of opening the account would make it expensive
@_date: 2014-05-02 09:52:22
I think I should add, 10 years ago I had a small business with a small overdraft of £5000 and a family. At the time I used to get biggish fees so I had almost maxed out on the overdraft when my next big fee arrived 5k incidentally.    
The fee paid of the overdraft and the same day the bank took away the overdraft. The result was I had to borrow money from family to pay for the food and I had to sell out and work for someone else.
Slowly I have rebuilt and all is great, but you can see why I am no fan 
@_date: 2014-10-27 11:11:25
Yes so until the credit card companies fix them then obviously there is a place for bitcoin which doesn't have their fundamental problems
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:55:59
PS It will not be the business because I offer a VPN and proxy service and I sell running sunglasses online
@_date: 2014-05-17 10:21:58
Why is it everytime I listen to Andreas I want to buy more, no strike that. He invigorates my passion and reminds me why I am involved. It is a unique moment in human history and the price is not that
@_date: 2014-05-03 07:58:49
A great answer
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:39:55
Have you not heard of escrow?
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:50:14
true but it is getting calmer but as we all know, there will be a jump in one direction or another lol
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:39:48
because you are not going to sell on mtgox when you can get 150 dollars more elsewhere and if you are looking to buy then it would make sense to buy on mtgox. All in all I do not think much will happen the price is likely to rise unless mtgox is insolvent but that price is already factored in. Also if they do vanish with the coins bitcoin in itself has not changed. When you have been in this for as long as I have it is just part of the processes and most people bought in for the long term. But hey I could be completely wrong ;)
Anyway we are all waiting to see what happens
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:17:41
So those people should get on with their lifes and not waste their time here
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:48:47
I think you have missed the point, it still takes the same time it is no faster than paypal and transferwise is no cheaper you cannot except payments with them on my website. The transfer fee from paypal to my account is free and via SEPA 
@_date: 2014-08-04 12:36:12
There is no fee!
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:12:52
Yep my sentiments entirely, mind you I bought at $30 only to see them go to $5 
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:53:03
I went into HSBC last year to open an account and they would not let me have one. Added to this I would have to pay a fee for having an account just for when I am in the UK for a couple of months a year!
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:57:16
Lol yep I think I am a bit like you!
@_date: 2014-04-28 15:17:22
Hi yep thanks for noticing, not sure how to fix so will ship for free. Other than that just want to say thanks again for being the first to buy in bitcoin it means a lot to me
@_date: 2014-06-17 09:36:58
I had a dream yesterday that China realised that they should accept bitcoin. I deal with China and the fees are crazy!
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:07:05
Well does not need to be 0.1 why not be the first person to buy a pair of Naked Runner sunglasses with a bitcoin just go here  they are running sunglasses but the black ones look cool too will ship anywhere in the world
Also could give you a mention if you have a website
PS I am not converting straight to Euros like others lol and the label is mine so could be valuable if I end up like Oakley ;)
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:14:50
Yep that point has not escaped me, I am hopping you are wrong as technically it is Euro to a Euro account and nothing to do with the UK but I could be wrong, but usually the case
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:24:54
26.42 euro cost me 6.12 which is 24.2%
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:18:52
This is so exciting at the moment, what with coloured coins too. I have not felt like this since I bought in when the coins were worth $20 each!
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:11:57
Lol I put all my spare cash in at $20 
@_date: 2014-05-23 08:51:12
Thanks but it seems like just another trading platform
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:25:31
Yes Spain is so far behind, I built a mining rig and bought the parts from my local pc shop, these two guys are experts as they do all the repairs etc. Would you believe they had never heard of bitcoin till I told them!!
A long way to go
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:40:35
lol seems like it 
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:26:24
Good luck Mark, I am impressed as an ex recruiter so have given you a mention on my blog
@_date: 2014-05-02 09:44:57
But I cannot open account as I am not based in the UK so they will not give me a bank account
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:03:54
Well said, it is so funny how the media has changed. It is like they realise that they are beat and trying another approach 
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:44:32
I understand and in many ways I agree. I expected this response from the banks because they are so blinkered, not from a bitcoin startup. What I do expect is that a small company would actually say, hey your application failed because of this...., can you let us have this info. But no just you failed, as I say it is OK as I was only applying just to see if they had anything more to offer than Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:58:46
True which is what I had done, I am not perfect as I do not earn a huge amount so you do the best you can. As I say I always send on a Thursday so it arrives on time, just no one told me it was a bank holiday yesterday
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:48:43
now I did not know that, coincidences 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:09:17
I should add that although the pounds go to my Spanish account I am in the UK at the moment so I will need to convert them back to £ the though doesn't bear thinking about
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:21:12
Just for your info, as a retailer you will be amazed how they rip us off. It may seem great we can advertise on their shop, but anything they see that sells well they buy themselves then under cut us or they just make the fees so big it becomes impossible to compete. Great for the consumer though, so I do something similar and do some research then buy on ebay as here in the UK there are no bitcoin retailers as such
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:02:13
Not a problem really, just hate selling my coins
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:16:57
By the way what is shilling?
@_date: 2014-05-11 09:57:11
It does!
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:38:05
Well that is what I do, which is why I have been caught out. The issue is the time it takes to transfer money. It was planed but because Thursday is a bank holiday in Spain it will take 4 days to get there instead of 1. Also I am self employed so I do not get a pay check and I get paid daily. I understand your comments but I am only talking about speed of transfer and how much easier it would be in a bitcoin world for this part
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:05:35
PS Barclays is not a Spanish bank 
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:19:02
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:32:55
To be honest when everyone accepts bitcoin we will not need to use them at all, the day will come
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:03:24
I do not mind companies making money but how much is enough?
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:15:50
This is fantastic as I use them a lot and to be honest this is were bitcoin makes obvious sense
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:28:48
LOl good answer I am almost tired of this 51% attack comment it is near impossible, there is no one individual anywhere near that figure. The nearest are mining pools and they are made up of hundreds of individuals anyway and whats the point!
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:15:34
Now you get it
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:24:18
I believe so, but just interesting to postulate! Then would be a case of educating those that wanted the privicy
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:35:10
All I can say is I am glad I did not listen to you guys 2 years ago and trusted my own gut feeling. Ask yourself why it is a bubble, because of its huge potential. That is why there is millions being invested not in the price but in its potential
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:39:36
Beginning to think I should have taken the dog for a walk than start this thread
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:25:50
Now that's an idea
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:38:18
Interesting response, which wallets are insecure on the Android? Also is it that big a deal when it is just like cash. Logically I would only have a few pounds on it and it cannot be any worse than having your actual wallet stolen (Physical)
@_date: 2014-03-12 10:00:37
Just shows you how wrong he is ;)
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:04:43
I have been with mtgox for a few years now and have traded fine.
When one hears all this negativity you just need to do a quick calculation on their fees. So on a bad day they make in fees (estimate):  58,341.15 USD and a good day they do 555,663 USD not a bad business This is at 0.6%
You could say this is why they are not bothered what people think, because all is OK. You could argue if there are issues they would be putting out info all the time to swell the panic, with lies. They are just getting on with the new trading platform, which I suspect will win them more business and they are buggered with the time it takes on all fronts. So rather than talk about it they get on with it.
Not saying I agree with this but certainly a possibility 
Oh I have not included all their other currency exchanges, so just imagine
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:13:10
Exactly but unfortunately that is how he sent it!!
@_date: 2014-08-02 17:21:27
At least someone here is making sense so for a great answer @_date: 2014-03-08 08:44:13
Thanks for the advice, I am not really much of an app man to be honest. I would have gone with blockchain app anyway as I am sure they are not up to anything. Also as I say I wouldn't have more than 20/50 pounds on it anyway.
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:36:26
Loved this analogy 
@_date: 2014-08-02 10:36:25
So far to me as an Expat paid in Euro and living in the UK at the moment seems fantastic. Looking forward to getting mine to test while in the UK. Logic seems to be to have one denominated in £ for UK and one for Spain in € in fact my wife is in Spain at the moment so she can have a euro one and I can have £ and I can top up either as need. All I know is that when I use my card here in the UK I am hammered in fees. Just need to avoid the ATM which is fine by me!
So to me looks good, better than the current system and given time can only get better, very excited!

Well said platypii interestingly tested withdrawing this morning and if it was a bug felt like it was fixed! I withdraw a bit of a coin and this time failed rather than go and nothing happen, because I tried again and this time accepted and went direct to my wallet. A good sign I felt

This is great news I use them quite often, shame they just missed out on two recent deals
@_date: 2014-08-02 21:47:52
You have no idea how useful it is, I cannot wait to get hold of the card it will make my life easier and cheaper, it is not perfect but until the world uses bitcoin this is ideal for me.
I am an expat having to juggle two currencies. I finally have a way to have all my money in bitcoin and use fiat only when I need too
@_date: 2014-05-30 06:33:04
You could argue she hates Dish and not bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-21 07:35:16
I think you missed the point the ATM did not charge me, the fee is in the rate of exchange plus an exchange fee. Obviously there are ways to mitigate this and to be honest when more companies use bitcoin there will be no need for an ATM. Also I am not rich so cannot transfer a large amount of cash to reduce the costs.In addition with localbitcoin again there is no need for an ATM either. Yes it may take a while but there is a structure in place already where you do not need an ATM where the money is supplied by the community, hich is actually quite a nice thought

Cheers, well wish I had not sold most of them to pay for my daughters driving lessons though lol

Not asked yet but I am in Bramhall and will pop into Manchester city tomorrow if you are around. Would be great to meet up!
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:11:26
Cheers for that will watch fr sure
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:01:08
Good effort, maybe you should add your litecoin address ;)
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:33:17
eloquently put, I thought the same
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:29:54
now that is funny
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:52:40
Well I am tuned in, who knows but I am a fan of Blockchain so will be good to hear no matter what
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:19:04
A good point will do that as the next experiment, I used it to buy a loaf of bread, then later a couple of beers in the pub. I would expect even more expensive but will be interesting to get a comparison
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:04:01
That is right so it should be there Monday, basically PayPal sends the payment on Thursday by SEPA I would assume. It will then arrive the next day which is Friday, so technically Spain did not see it arrive Thursday as they are on Holiday and process it today to clear tomorrow and because it will be Saturday I will not see it in my account till Monday (During that time they are making money)
@_date: 2014-05-11 10:12:16
I agree I think what I could do with is something like a page there people could apply or I could see the retweets etc then send them a tip or a page where they could apply for a tip or even free products etc
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:13:26
I stopped using credit cards 10 years ago they are the reason for the mess we are in. And you are forgetting the 30% APR you are paying if you do not clear the funds it is a scam
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:17:26
Not really just depends on your circumstances, for me it is a no brainier but for people in the UK it is hard to see the benefit. It is only when the banks take your money you suddenly realise what is going on just ask many of the citizens in Greece
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:44:50
Thanks, not sure why but with the tips makes me feel a teenager again!
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:30:47
Unfortunately he did, but gives me an excuse to tell him why he should have used bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:18:34
Yep well I get charged between 10 and 20% from paypal not including any currency exchange fees As they are either €3 or €5 monthly recurring. Saying that cannot complain too much as without them I couldn't operate
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:13:06
Well I sent him the price off a coffee from here in Spain "cafe con leche" I hope is OK
@_date: 2014-05-17 10:09:07
If you want my opinion PayPal already operates like bitcoin, it has the perfect wallet. I have used PayPal for a number of years and my success could not have happened without them. 
I am happy with their fees albeit expensive, but you can transfer money by email and accept payments on your website. They are also restricted like the rest of us in that you cannot transfer at the weekends and it takes at least 24 hrs to reach your bank account.
But the huge thing I am guessing with PayPal would be that they can finally open their service for people without a bank account or credit card and the same goes with ebay to some extent. That would be huge for them and superb for us. 
The issue I am guessing more than anything is the legal frame work, which is a headache I am sure
So my guess for the future of PayPal is no change it will be is a wallet that like in my case has $ £and € with the balance is expressed in my local currency, but with the addition of a bitcoin/crypto currency balance in the future.
It is actually quite exciting I will be able to buy and sell to more countries around the world and at the same time spread the wealth
And to finish in regards to the actual article, volatility will be of no relevance to them

I must read too many comments, so when one makes total sense I just have to say I agree. I for one look forward to that day
@_date: 2014-10-30 08:43:35
That is kind of how I felt no need to mention bitcoin it speaks for itself
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:55:57
Yes just a scam I looked when they first said they were supporting bitcoin about a year ago I think, then found out they do not accept bitcoin. You would think people like this would get it but no!!
@_date: 2014-09-17 22:01:04
Yep lat time I bought was about here my guess is that we are all waiting
@_date: 2018-10-16 07:07:58
So true and well said. Been like this for years, hope you got the gold first time I used. There should be a option to use crypto though ;)
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:50:37
I still think there is a chance, if not it could be the best travel currency in the world. In regards to speed of transactions and blockchain size, I would envisage that all terminals would just say coinbase accepted here!
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:12:20
No it is just for this community, only with the bitcoin code
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:10:57
Back up must have crashed with an over load
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:14:18
I should just add sanswork if you read all the comments in particular on my facebook page you will see the that these are well respected even a mention in the Telegraph here in the UK
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:08:07
That was a nice surprise thanks
@_date: 2015-07-22 13:10:07
Thanks for this and pleased to say just had an order, so chuffed as it is not the UK
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:37:54
thanks greencoiman that made me smile
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:10:34
Well just been going for a couple of years and going very well, just wanted to pass something on to the community. It is a new brand but the quality is as good as sunglasses in the £100+ range
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:08:28
If you go to the website you will see the price is £35 if you then use the discount code it will drop to £20 just for you and then because I have used coinbase I have reduced it by another 2% just for bitcoin.
It is once off offer, to give people a reason to spend bitcoin and have an advantage for using, maybe I did not explain myself!
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:11:28
PS just check the calculations
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:56:40
Thanks I am sure I did try
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:07:47
Only need polorised for fishing in reality, was looking at them for skiing but again dangerous with ice tough one really. Still no problem glad you took a look
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:26:39
Explain yourself!
@_date: 2016-09-05 10:48:45
Just seen this and seems I was right, made all my money back. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:16:34
Just to ad my 2 bits worth!! As someone who sells online and an expat you really notice the value. You would be amazed at the fees to send money to China the fees that PayPal takes and the time it takes to transfer. For a vendor it is obvious like me, but for a consumer it is not. There is a long way to go and the technology is exciting in what it can achieve
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:57:55
Well it just shows you how easy it is to do and I AM EXPERIANCEd
