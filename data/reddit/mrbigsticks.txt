I recently came to the same realization that anyone that owns any bitcoin from this point forward will likely keep a significat portion of their assets in, and will likely continue to put fiat in because they'll come to think exactly like you, because it's logical. 
Fiat is no longer conducive to saving, and some people (smart people) are going to have fiat to put somewhere.... 
And that 21 million limit is a beautiful thing when that realization hits enough people. 
Now we just have to get them all intereste in defending the original principals behind bitcoin...

I see bitmain's logo there. How about funding for an implementation with a change in POW to be asic-resistant. That's what bitcoin needs. Best/Worst case scenario I see is cheap coins as the centralizers bail.

I know it isn't an easy thing or even necessarily desirable, but your statement seems to imply that miners have to agree to the change if there's a POW change. That is inconsistent, either we can change it without them or we simply can't change it. Also, note that I didn't say only nodes, I said economic majority. Miners are only a part of the economic majority in as much as they transact with bitcoin, not with their hashing power.

@_date: 2017-04-13 09:22:27
I could setup a bunch of nodes and try to change rules that way, but if they're just dummy nodes that never generate a transaction, then any changes I make will be promptly ignored by the rest of the network, where all the economic activity takes place. I'm still learning and open to debate, but the previous poster just needed correcting as they were obviously mistaken.

Okay if you've been around and know that, then you know there are many different types of POW and we can change it and kick bitmain out of the race. I didn't see any debate about whether to change the POW but I see you saying we can't change the POW because POW rules. That's kinda like saying we can't change and drive a chevy because cars are better. Well, chevy makes cars and we can change the TYPE of POW and still use POW

@_date: 2017-04-23 08:25:35
so, one outcome of this is that bitcoin and litecoin have a centralization point in mining. I like the little bit I've read about vertcoin and their dedication to mining decentralization. We need mining to swing back toward decentralization that's for sure.

What role do the 'technological folk' play in this? I guess they're the workhorses and the philosophers and such are the intellectuals that will carry us forth huh? That's would lead to problems worse than you can imagine and it would artificially inflate the egos of people who know nothing of what they speak. If satoshi doesn't inspire you, then you're in the wrong place, period.
If you think technilogical folk aren't deep thinkers, then I'm sure you aren't among 'technological folk'. Only non-technical people can ignore the depth and complex thinking required of good technical people.

Why can technical thinkers not also deliver the ideology. They've done so so far. Someone else mentioned A Antonop. He's very inspirational, very knowledgeable, and actually has a strong IT background. He's very good. 
Also, as I mentioned, Satoshi is very very inspiring. And he obviously didn't believe that bitcoin needed a leader.
What would be your ideal person to bring bitcoin to the masses? Advertisers? ^lol
@_date: 2017-04-29 19:32:24
I was probably arguing out of brief irritation more than anything, more to do with the call for advertising in some coin forums. I would love to have more A Antonop's or....idk I don't watch a lot of video but he's compelling and articulates well some very interesting ideas. He's more believable to me though because of his tech background. 
I think if bitcoin (or real money in general) grows you will see more and more inspiring thinkers. And maybe some of the existing wallflowers will bloom and share their inspired thoughts. One thing seems certain, those into bitcoin don't seem to be the lazy types (at least not 'sit on the couch' lazy, maybe lazy in the sense that they'd like to make a lot of money easily lol, but who isn't lazy in that way?). So it feels like the train is on the tracks and we'll see more and more of all the things that make it grow, including more inspiring thinkers. That's my hopeful thinking anyway and I do agree witht you that I hope to see more people who understand the philosophy behind bitcoin and are able to spread that philosophy and spread bitcoin. Sorry for going on the attack.

That does seem the most likely scenario, and the one I've been going by the last while. 
I think the market is just doing it's thing and shaking me up lol. I've been one hell of a hodler, but this china gwf thing shook me up. If all that hashpower is unable to verify transactions, the network will be facing something it hasn't ever faced before to my knowledge. And as was said in a previous reddit post, bitcoin depends on censor-resistant bandwidth.

@_date: 2017-09-17 13:15:20
xmr doesn't fit into either category though unless I'm mistaking soething. 
I'm honestly starting to think that bitcoin will need a) pow change to an asic resistant pow algo and b) (forced?) integration of something to get through the gfw and c) dedication to both of those things going forward from the dev team and the community.
The POW change would be to keep mining centralization from happening (so that a geopolitical threat wouldn't be so damaging if a certain area does this or goes offline for some other reason, taking with it the vast majority of the hashrate). And of course the additional network resiliancy would be beneficial to re-include China and any other geo-political areas that try something similar.  
That leads me to two burning questions u/adam3us that I would greatly value your input on. 
1. how would kovri fair in allowing communications past the gfw (on an ongoing, evolving basis)?
2. can we, should we, would we implement kovri or something like it in bitcoin? 
I know those are 2 big, specific questions, so any advice in regards to the china gfw situation and if i2p, kovri, or anything in that arena could benefit bitcoin and chinese bitcoin users (and, yes, even miners lol).
I know tor is there, but i've had the sense that too many tor exit nodes have been compromised for too long.
Edit: just read about the blockstream satellite. That gives me a lot of hope. Though a funny situation just occurred to me, imagine bitmain and co depending on the blockstream satellite to mine. Oh that would be some rich justice lol

I'm not a trader but more a bitcoin fanatic, but if you go through my history a bit ib's obvious I'm big on monero. I don't know if it'll be available cheaper than it is now relative to btc, but I do believe it's undervalued against btc and against fiat. Of course everyone's view of ANY coin is seen through bitcoin glasses, no altcoin is going to get out of that shadow soon, but monero's value proposition and what it delivers is so much better than anything out there that it's ridiculous. 
Disclaimer: I've had a few beers now so my rambling is more extensive than it might be otherwise,  but monero is pretty great and you'll see that by observing it's community, learning it's value proposition, and just over time in general, I think

Sweet, so you know in QT  when you go to File --&gt; Receiving Addresses, and the screen pops up for Receiving Addresses...in that screen, when I go to copy an address, there's a big list there, I tend to generate addresses in bulk, maybe that's just me, but anyway, if an address receives any balance, if the address was red instead of black, for used addresses, that would help me to not re-use addresses. 
Along with the message there about 'These are your bitcoin addresses....' I would personally add another little bit at the end that used addresses will be red. Simple but effective I think. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:42:33
POW is great. We don't need bitmain to have POW. We can have a different POW and get rid of bitmain. You're confused if you think bitmain and pow go together. Bitmain and ASIC's go together, and they're subject to using the POW that the bitcoin network uses, which can change.

@_date: 2017-05-08 02:17:24
On the contrary, I think they're displaying leadership by explaining their positions here for us plebes and showing us how these kinds of decisions should be made. Despite disagreeing, people like luke-jr and greg can state their case and focus on tech fundamentals. These are the people that should be furthering bitcoin. 
Is jihan the kind of leader you want? try litecoin, he and charlie are the whole leadership there, and for the sake of miner sales and pumping a coin with no development for years, they're agreeing a whole lot here recently and really capitalizing on segwit. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:07:25
They make ASICS for one particular implementation of POW. There are many other implementations of POW. One could be implemented in bitcoin that would make CPU's and GPU's profitable at ~~whatever hashrate~~ their much lower hashrate, and invalidate bitmain and avalon's ability to attack teh coin via their hashpower. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:19:29
That's a fair point but if you're familiar with asicboost, margins on mining and their consequent 20 x profitability, as well as their other actions, I would think it's fair to assert that selling to small players is strictly in their own benefit and doesn't indicate to me any good will toward users, or any dedication to the decentralization of mining. Have they published any statements regarding decentralization of mining? Any pledges or any other show of good will like that? On the other hand, I see blockstream and their tolerance of bitmain using their code (segwit) to pump their (L3) miner sales and to pump the price of litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:02:24
If that were true bitcoin wouldn't stand a chance, and we'd have bigger blocks already doncha think? Bitmain owns enough hash power to control bitcoin, and obviously enough hash power to block segwit. Is that centralization not a problem for you?
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:38:05
I'm kind of torn honestly but what I've been thinking recently is the fact that we see a clear emergence of three groups in bitcoin, which any individual could belong to any of the three groups, they're not mutually exclusive (which is actually quite rare and interesting). So the groups are miners, dev's, and users who's real power is concentrated at exchanges or transaction-generators. 
With the attempt at 95% miner activation, we got a really good glimpse at the landscape, divisions and such. 
Of course with the scaling debate, segwit and lightning, and the host of other solutions, we see the core dev's contributions and stances generally on scaling, security etc (though I understand all core dev's don't agree on everything). 
Now that they've shown their cards, we see what appears to me to be a clear distinction being made of the third group which includes users, transaction-generators, node-operators, kind of the bedrock. I really don't see the dev's or the miners coming in and explicitely engaging in the user's conversation about bip148, as miners and dev's. It's users discussing it, mostly. 
Maybe I have a utopian view or I'm letting myself enjoy all the rich lessons and ignoring that the house is on fire, but I'm learning a ton about how controversy plays out in bitcoin's specific circumstances. Hopefully it makes us all smarter and hopefully none of us is any poorer monetarily for our trial and error :)
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:16:43
but  you can fork to a different POW, and still be using POW which we agree is great. Not saying it will be easy or even desirable necessarily, but it's an option, and there are various reasons why it may happen.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:46:09
that's a very good point
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:16:04
you're right, poor argument. Have an upvote.
I don't think it's too unbelievable that bitmain would try to influence others in the bitcoin ecosystem to block segwit. Maybe it's not true, but neither of us has proof either way. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:25:44
also, do you know what litecoin's original selling point was? how that related to asics? What was the point of making it asic-resistant and then making a deal with the asic manufacturer? You can see that reflected in the price. I'm sure that eventually you'll see other effects of that allliance in the future. And remember, prices in crypto are very elastic. I feel bad for anyone holding a lot of litecoin if it tanks, which I think it will.
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:32:42
please expound on what exactly uasfers have done that's low. trying to keep their coin from being censorable by power-hungry miners is not low and it's exactly the kind of thing bitcoin was designed for. I'd say all the things that jihan, xt, classic, ver, and all those people have done is toxic and low. But it's funny that it's obviously low, like they know only noobs and total idiots will listen to them.....
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:59:03
What do you mean teh only ones doing pow. cpu's and gpu's still do pow effectively on many other coins. I think you need to do some more reading. Or I can try to answer your questions. But yeah, you need a better understanding of pow and a better understanding of mining, and mining hardware manufacturers, and probably bitcoin as well. Keep reading, but beware posting your opinion before understanding! 
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:15:05
Is it possible for anyone to compete with bitmain profitably?
Also, there are a few 'markets' to consider here. There's the hardware market, which they're in, and they can make ASIC's to their hearts content. If their ASICs become, let's call it obsolete, products become obsolete in the market all the time, and big players are effected by that. In mature markets though, big players know enough to keep ahead of that curve, that or they suffer the consequences. 
Another 'market' is the currency market or the assett market, whatever you prefer bitcoin to be. In that market, bitmain is just one player in a whole field of different offerings for the 'service' that they offer (ie securing the network). If consumers in the bitcoin market decide they can get the service of securing the network in a better manner than what is currently provided by this service provider, then why can they not choose and work toward a better service provider? Let's say I own a cpu and a graphics card and I'd like to 'compete' with bitmain, become a competitor. In the bitcoin ecosystem that's part of the currency or asset market, is it not my right to look for ways in which I can use my cpu or gpu to competitively provide that service? And if there is a way to do so, isn't it my right to work toward that end? 
To be clear, I don't think anyone wants to change the POW for the block reward or transaction fees. If they're like me, look favorably on a POW change because they see bitmain as a potential single point of failure in a system that was designed to have no single point of failure. And maybe because bitmain is pissing them off by stalling segwit on bitcoin (in my opinion and logically) just so that they can sell their new litecoin miners. It's ridiculously obvious to anyone that thinks about it and is  honest about it. Makes a LOT of sense that they'd do anything to pump litecoin when their new L3's came out. And that's shitty behavior. And people who understand bitcoin a whole lot better than I do think that all us regular users have a say in the matter. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:30:53
I'm comparing transaction fees. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency. The dollar is a currency. A transaction fee is a transaction fee. I'm comparing a transaction fee to a transaction fee so it's apples to apples, though I do get your point. You can say that people can't spend bitcoin as easily as they can cash, but that is another metric and that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about transaction fees and they are the same thing in this context without a doubt. transaction fee = transaction fee

what about Adam Back's assessment that increasing the blocksize to (was it 2 mb or 4 mb) would result in node operators needing a $10,000 node to process transactions? jihan's response to that was that you need to be serious to be in bitcoin. Well sure you can have a bunch of serious bankers ripping people off but that doesn't help all the little guys that would like to have the ability to house the blockchain themselves, verify transactions, support the network, and have some privacy in their transactions. All of those things go away for the little guy when a bitcoin node no longer runs on a home PC.
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:53:59
If any new readers see this guys nonsense, please don't listen to him. UASF is as honest an effort to change the code as there has been. Node operators have no incentive other than to keep bitcoin secure, to want to fork. However bitmain has many incentives to want to delay segwit on bitcoin. The first incentive is to pump the price of litecoin so they can sell more miners. 
I'm a full node operator and I take bitcoin's core principals seriously, and I take the opinion of experts like Adam Back and Greg Maxwell seriously. And I understand the profit motive of bitmain and also that of blockstream. Bitmain have proven themselves bad actors by blocking segwit (with obvious motives) while blockstream has dutifully written some awesome code and had it summarily stolen from it's originally intended purpose and applied to litecoin only to pump a dead coin. 
Blockstream is dedicated to open-source, secure software, while bitmain is dedicated to maximizing it's own profits and centralizing power over bitcoin.

so you're intentionally misdirecting the argument then. You quoted him saying that coblee signed a suicide agreement to get segwit (nothing at all about bip148) after saying that you think he means BIP148 is a game of chicken. 
I don't have to interpret anything because the quote you included spells it out. Here, I'll quote you quoting greg.


Okay I'll say it now that it's posted. litecoin signed a suicide promise to get seggwit activated. Charlie lee is the person who made the agreement. Nothing about bitcoin or bip148 having to do with suicide promise. If you argue that point further I won't respond because you're contradicting yourself already by quoting and then saying you interpret something ridiculously different.

To be clear, it's bitmain and supporters of xt, bu, viabtc and such that you feel should be offered a carrot? It sounds all nice and peaceful but I wouldn't blame anyone for not wanting to give ground to people so reckless. Bitmain hasn't shown any regard for the will of the users on the network so far, or any dedication to the decentralization of mining, or even the decentralization of bitcoin. They've acted recklessly (xt, bu, viabtc etc...) and are being eyed warily for that, and for good reason. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 02:16:24


What economic actors? Who is more of an expert at economics than Adam Back who has been advocating for and working on digital cash for longer than most people here have even known what digital cash is? He isn't the end-all, be-all, but I've been around long enough to know who knows what they're talking about and who doesn't. I see a lot of obvious bullshit on this sub and elsewhere, I'm done being quiet. People will look at this stuff for years and I don't want them thinking that bitmain, ver, xt, classic, and all the rest of the failures-from-the-start attempts at power grabs, are legitimate or good actors. They have very little support and what little they do have, they usually pay for. I really don't believe there are that many dumb people.


of course I know what open source means, and what bitmain did in light of everyone watching was to block segwit on bitcoin and then allow it on litecoin only after making an arrangement with coblee. They are shitty actors. maybe they can't be held legally liable, and maybe no one wants to hold them liable for their bullshit, but what they did and how they did it was straight up stealing the value proposition. Why didn't you quote my whole statement? Because I said they stole the value proposition and it doesn't stand up for your strawman if you say the whole thing. 
Respond if you want but if I feel you're continuing to try to bullshit and be sly, I probably won't respond.

charlie lee made an agreement with jihan wu. Don't know the specifics, but the general details are that wu gets to control litecoin, segwit will get activated, wu will get a lot more sales of his brand new L3 miners (imagine the timing of that when he can conveniently block segwit on bitcoin and activate it on litecoin, thereby transferring the value proposition of segwit from bitcoin to litecoin, increase miner sales, and increase the value of the (used-to-be) nearly dead litecoins which users will now happily trade for asics now that they're profitable again). A lot of that is my speculation, but it doesn't take a genius to put the pieces together and compute the motives and the outcomes. I think most of the poeple that have it figured out are keeping quiet as to make money off of the pumps and eventual crash.
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:18:31
what are you talking about? sending bitcoin costs the exact same no matter the location of sender or receiver, and if the receiver accepts bitcoin and doesn't need to convert immediately to fiat, then there is nothing to consider.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:39:38
so you're denying that bitmain controls enough hardware to produce 51% or greater percent of the hashrate? 
Cloud mining isn't profitable and so will naturally have few suckers I mean customers. Who else has a say in all that hashpower that bitmain controls? 
I doubt even 30% of new hardware ever goes beyond bitmain's control currently and I suspect it's been that way for at least 2 releases of their hardware, but that's my own speculation. I also strongly suspect they control more hashrate than just antpool, and I'm not the only one that suspects that. 
If we can't agree on some fundamentals, that bitmain has enough power/hashpower to disrupt bitcoin, then I don't think there's any sense discussing further because I won't believe you're being genuine in your assertions.

I didn't misunderstand anything. That may have happened to you but what these numbskulls believe is that there's some point at which that will happen to everyone and it will be the end of capitalism. What a wrong conclusion drawn by people with more emotions than knowledge of the subject they're discussing. I never looked into 'late stage capitalism' until their post, and a quick internet search, but I didn't misunderstand anything and that poster is just as wrong as I pointed out above, as well as everyone on that crazy sub These people would be dangerous if they ever gained enough voting power to steal everything from everyone around them.

and I didn't say the fed controls all banks, I said all the banks in the us. Big difference. It's a good idea to be accurate when countering someone elses point.

Feel free to visit that nuthouse over at - here's a quote from some of their rules, by the way this rule is repeated again and again on their site with showing more irritation than the last mention lol. They seem to like echo chambers - I really want these nutjobs governing everything I do and 'centrally planning' all resources in the economy!  /s
Quote from their rules "Support for capitalism--and the political parties which uphold it--is strictly prohibited;"

that is some goofy half-baked crap. 
'technology hits  physicaly limitations'
I think you or someone is just throwing words around to describe a not even half baked idea that they hope will happen to 'end capitalism'. How goofy. 'Technology' in all sectors does not grow or stop growing at the same pace at the same exact time, ever. Please don't listen to whoever believes such nonsense.

I don't have to read it because it's true. If you don't understand how that's the case you need to do some more reading. Read some history, learn about Andrew Jackson and 'I killed the bank'. If you still don't understand, I'll take some time and explain it.

only temporarily. Either to force a chain split (if you beleive two coins will be more valuable in the short or long term...) or....to delay segwit longer while you dump jihancoins... uh I mean litecoins. 
(rant warning) The end game seems to be a long delay tactic from jihan and I think it has to do with L3 sales and litecoin's continued efficacy. And they're stealing segwit from it's authors and from the bitcoin community (and hodlers) to do so....

no but they can be created by a federal reserve that is owned and run by the banks, and which federal reserve also resists audits and is shady as hell, and controls all banks in the US. Nope, no problem there. Wait did you say banks don't print dollars? lmao WRONG

promoting your tweets....by paying people to retweet them....to bolster the appearance of unpopular opinions to make them seem more popular than they are. 
Some people have more integrity (and care more about real consensus) than to do that.

If you're using the core client, don't accept any of their fees. Instead, lookup the current fee and set your btc pert kb to a rate much lower than the core client is setting it. The fee estimator there is f'd up and I paid the same 4$ fee some weeks ago totally unnecessarily. Start calculating your own fees and don't trust any wallet software to do so, not even core.
Edit: to be specific I'm running 13.2, maybe the fee estimator got better in later versions.
What wallet did you use?
