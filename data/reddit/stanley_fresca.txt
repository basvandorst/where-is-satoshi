Snooped on private conversations?
No, they mined data that their users gave them permission to access. If you have a FB account, read the ToS.

It's also a good idea to avoid doing business with people who sound like 12 year olds online.

On the other hand, the most popular use cases for bitcoin (cheap remittance) have nothing to do with anonymity and privacy. The popular bitcoin services  (circle, coinbase, etc) have absolutely no privacy for account holders. Facebook has about 2 billion users and their entire business model is based on not having privacy.
What makes you think that a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency can outcompete one that's just easy to use and accepted everywhere?

Generous? Add up the tips, I'm guessing they spent under $100 for all this attention.

I wish that scammer would stay far away from Bitcoin. Unfortunately, he's drawn to opportunities to defraud people and the Bitcoin community is full of ripe targets where people have more Bitcoins than sense.
The dude has a rap sheet for fraud and embezzlement a mile long and he's been constantly on the run from various governments since the 90s. If you care about your Bitcoins, don't let them anywhere near this guy.

It's pretty common in &gt; I have no reference point for my $10,000.
That's really strange, unless you don't live in the US. Most citizens have a feel for what their local currency will buy them.
What will 21 BTC buy you now? What would it buy you exactly one year ago? What do you think it'll buy you one year from now?
BTC is so incredibly volatile compared to USD that most people simply don't have a reference point for what BTC will buy them right now unless they use it every day and keep up with the exchange rate. Don't forget that the entire purpose of a currency is to exchange it for goods and services. If nobody is willing to accept a BTC for their goods or services, it's useless, regardless of how many there are. Bitcoin can't exist in a vacuum and increase in value just because there are a fixed number of them.

It's probably based on the NAV as reported by the Bitcoin Investment Trust.

It sounds like you don't know what a bank is. The definition of a bank is that they take deposits and lend those deposits out. As far as I know, Coinbase and Circle don't do that. There's no lending aspect, they're not a bank.
A much better definition of what they do is an "online wallet". You give them money, they store it for you. That's what a wallet does.
You can use your same argument against online backup services, email services, cloud-based document apps like Google Docs and Office 365, etc.
Sure, hosting all of your own services works great for some people, but just because you don't like it doesn't mean everyone else is wrong.

You mean besides giving them your name and shipping address?

It's hilarious that you uploaded an error_log file with your username and password in it.
Edit: It's REALLY hilarious that you uploaded more than one error_log file with your username and password in it, and one of them is 46MB long.

They're ads. Someone paid for them. They don't make money, they cost money.

There's also nothing to prevent the government from confiscating cash in your house. They've done it before: 
But there's also nothing to prevent the government from sending a SWAT team into your house and killing you, your family, and your pets.
The "nothing to stop the government" arguments are stupid. Just because you hold your bitcoin wallet in a super secure location, that doesn't mean the government won't get it if they want it. 
There are a lot of great reasons to use Bitcoin. "Hiding assets from the government" isn't one of them, and people who suggest that don't really understand the power that governments have over people.

OP didn't do a good job explaining what they are or how people would benefit either. You need to be a little more specific than "the possibilities are endless". How about some concrete examples, @_date: 2015-03-17 12:29:06
Larger companies have more lawyers, and lawyers need to have rules to follow.
If you're an executive at a large and established company and propose doing something with bitcoin, your legal team will come back and say they don't advise it because of lack of regulation and legal precedent for issues involving bitcoin.
Big companies are often targets for frivolous lawsuits and patent trolls simply because they have more money. The legal team is paid to minimize the damage those lawsuits can cause.
I'm not saying I agree with it, but that's reality.
Source: I work at a pretty big company and have to deal with lawyers a lot.

Yeah, that's why it's hilarious that there was a post yesterday talking about how if you deposit money in a bank, the government can take it away. Big deal. If you're using bitcoin, merchants could just refuse to accept transactions from your wallet.

OP's post history is 90% spamming about the MIT Bitcoin Expo

I'd say getting raided by the police is a pretty big inconvenience and having purse.io promise to reimburse you for legal expenses shouldn't exactly make you feel better about it.
Do you really think it's worth saving 20% on Amazon purchases with the chance that cops will bust down your door in the middle of the night and take all of your computers and financial documents? That purse might reimburse you for legal defense fees and you might eventually get your stuff back a few months or years later?

It's a lot easier to type out 21M than 20999999.9769.

Wow, that's a sure sign of a sociopath right there. Tons of other people lost money because of him and he has no interest in getting it back and just wants to put everything behind him and move to another country?
That sounds like a few other bitcoin scammers out there who claimed there were hacks or they didn't know where the money went.

My bank will cut a cashier's check for free but it involves actually going to the branch and talking to their outdated human teller system.

Sorry, but that's the worst idea ever. You can't expect merchants to keep their servers secure enough to host a hot wallet on them. Stripe and Coinbase have teams of dedicated security people and insurance policies that cover them in the event of a security breach. Most merchants do not. 
In fact, I wouldn't even trust your code. Have you had an independent security audit?
0.5% is a small price to paid to actually be sure you get the money from your transactions and not having to worry about someone breaking into your server and stealing the money. Your heart is in the right place, but your project is downright dangerous.

The fact that the coins can be tracked and tainted is a fundamental fact of the bitcoin protocol. If you want a currency that can't be tracked as easily, consider using paper US dollars.

Let's trust the guy who thinks he doesn't need two-factor auth on his email account because he has a really awesome password. Then he lets his accountant withdraw $50k for office furniture without so much as a phone confirmation.
Yeah, this guy is exactly what bitcoin needs!
@_date: 2015-02-27 02:15:36
Yep. See 
The only way this dudes account got "hacked" is if he doesn't give a shit about security, which is bad for someone involved in bitcoin, or it's an inside job that he's personally involved in.

Check again. Browsers do use a blacklist, but it's not hardcoded and the browser doesn't refuse to connect to the site - it warns the user but they still have the choice to continue.
