[IT'S HAPPENING](

The sheer amount of unnecessary negativity here is just straight up bizarre
@_date: 2014-12-04 18:05:37
So much for trying to have a real discussion.  You're either a troll, mildly retarded, a shill, or all of the above.
Edit:  read through your comment history a bit.  You are a troubled fella/lady with some anger issues. You may not even realize it, but you are just a fountain of negativity.  I sincerely hope you find a way out of that cycle.  Best of luck to you.

You've found at least one counterexample to that in me. I'm no libertarian (I think it's naive), and I'm certainly not 13.  I think the Fed is hard to defend, but taxes and government institutions are still necessary.
Forget bitcoin specifically, how about cryptocurrency in general - do you see the value in it?

I've said it before and I'll say it again, the amount of unprovoked negativity here is downright bizarre.  I may need to put on my tinfoil hat, but the accusations of paid nay-sayers seems more and more likely.  Anyone who has spent even a moderate amount of time reading into bitcoin can clearly see the gigantic possible implications.

Not just this guy though, it's all over this sub.  Why subscribe to a subreddit about X only to constantly try to shit on X?
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:07:56
In what way is bitcoin libertarians' pipedream?  I don't see how you need to be a libertarian to see the power of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:58:31
Even if that was the case, and it's all spam, it's caused legitimate users to have problems.  Some have had enough issues to speak up loudly about it while providing proof.  
I don't see how this is an acceptable situation.  Do you think bitcoin should just be limited in scope/usage?
@_date: 2016-12-21 13:40:24
I cashed out around 450 to spend money.  Really kicking myself, still.  I had a lot of money into it, too :-(

Off topic, but every single episode link on London Real's site 404's.  Shame, really wanted to listen to this
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:52:52
You mean this isn't a joke?  I assumed someone drew this up as a parody...

Last night I finally bought into bitcoin when I saw the price start to shoot up.  I bought 5 at $312 and it immediately started dropping.  Feeling like a bit of an idiot quite honestly.  No real question here, just wanted to share my dismay :(

Very clever

Lol holy shit dude -- you're lashing out at a bystander.
OP's attack is legit as far as I can tell.  Posting it on a public forum (be it git, btctalk, wherever) is exactly the kind of place you talk about problems with open source software.  What the hell are you even going on about?
I'm becoming more and more skeptical of the LN implementation generally.  It started when I read or watched that talk about how "SegWit coins are not Bitcoins".  Interesting stuff.

They also removed all the comments from that post calling it out as a scam
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:53:11
This is a scam.  There is no SP40, period.  The correct site is 
Get the fuck out of here with this garbage
Edit:  wow there is a lot of vote manipulation going on in this thread
@_date: 2015-11-03 13:09:14
Why are they scum bags
@_date: 2016-05-19 00:41:14
Hoping for a sharp drop so I can buy back in :-D
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:45:10
My sentiments exactly
@_date: 2015-11-03 13:01:21
Can someone explain the joke
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:18:18
Not popular around here, but I just dumped at $398.  Plan on buying back in during the next lull I'm wagering will occur
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:24:49
Did you respond to the wrong person?

Enforcing SegWit on the back of a questionable "security" patch is a principled thing to do?
