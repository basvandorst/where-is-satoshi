Robocoin machines are a joke and a big disgrace to the BTC community. Absolutely ruins the transaction for customers and is a complete sellout. What a shame the first BTC ATM to arrive was one of those.

Except there's so few out there, that most phones will tell you such large distances that you won't even go.

Heard this machine was sold by Genesis Coin. Surprised none of the other BTC ATM companies have used LTC and Doge. Seems more versatile, considering the traction the other alternative cryptocurrencies are getting.

Please understand that bitcoin is NOT A STOCK, or LIKE A STOCK......AT ALL. If anything it is a commodity. It does not generate cash flow and it never will. Its unique purpose it to serve as a versatile and secure store of value.

Thank you for the first answer that addresses my question. What is your opinion about adding velocity in, to show the amount of transaction volume needed to facilitate those transactions based on the frequency of its use?

Because "value" is defined as the market price of it. I'm not asking for that. Read the original post.

When did he say this?
@_date: 2015-07-10 10:56:06
Good question; looks like the 400 is a probability-adjusted present value of the future value of btc "cash flows" (aka market uses) based on the velocity needed to maintain the network for those uses. Since they're stock analysts and the present value of an asset is the sum of its future cash flows (in this example 10yrs + going into perpetuity), it's typical to assign this value with an arbitrary period (12 mos). I think the key takeaway is that they're actually using some sort of fundamental valuation method (versus looking at lines on a chart, or regressions of the price), but still more detailed than something as basic as  (which takes no velocity/discounting into account, which are very important).
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:56:56
Great, thanks for this precise explanation. I predict the price will move either up or down in the near and long term future. Hopefully the chart moves to the right too.
