Change your thinking. Bitcoin isn’t half the coin Monero is. Time to let the world know that too.

Bitcoin cash seems like a much better buy over bitcoin right now. It’s sat value is super low compared to where it has been and just about  everyone who takes bitcoin takes bitcoin cash too. Let flaming begin

Congrats on 1 bitcoin. I would put it all on BCH if you want to own 2 bitcoin. With the  fork in May and BCH integrating Schnorr signatures I’m calling .1 sats by June 1. Congrats again though. Nothing better than getting your first Bitcoinafter the big Bullrun of 2017

Shit man if you liked it at 4k you ought to love BCH at 160.  With Schnorr Sigs coming in May prepare for takeoff. If I were you though I would not FOMO in at 4k again though. Goodluck.

Not really the reciever gave me a transaction ID and I did not list it on the bank wire so they had the money but it was lost in their system and did not know who it was sent from. My fault and my bank bailed me out of huge mess by reversing the transfer and resubmitting it again with the proper ID number. Mistakes happen my friend.

Million dollar bitcoin or the dick feast. One is certain for sure

You are wrong on that and I speak from personal experience. It can be done

Blessing to you and your family for writing such a great quality post tonight.

You guys need to stop dreaming about million dollar bitcoin and start preparing for 4-5k bitcoin.

So what will increase more this year? BTC or BCH? I don’t like to gamble so I hodl them both
