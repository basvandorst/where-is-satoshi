Really you don't necessarily need to continue the exchange, you could simply start a non-profit BTC exchange which uses fees to pay back verified MtGox victims... not a bad idea, actually, if you're the kind of type who could start an exchange and felt like going through massive loads of red tape...and thought you could find a good way to detect fraud, etc. etc.
Sooo many problems to overcome, I sadly don't see this going very far. But it'd rock if it would!

He does seem to be not the kind of guy who would just make stuff up...
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:45:47
Right, but he wants to know if he's being lied to. Which doesn't seem to me like he is fully 100% certain that they are telling the truth.
But tbh, I think the more likely scenario is that paul's info (which he says is 1.5 days old) is just outdated, that the buyers are no longer bidding but are stepping back due to the massive storm approaching.

There is a huge ask wall at 48 and an even bigger one at 48.6 : 
I think part of the strategy could be to then also set up some bids at 47 or 46 and that way make a killing on the volatility as the price keeps running up against that ask wall.

1. Get Electrum.
2. Backup your passphrase somewhere VERY safe (like on paper in a safe)
3. Set up a very secure password for sending money from Electrum.
4. Send your coins to your receiving address(es).
Done. Electrum is so much more user-friendly than Bitcoin-QT, and it has the added benefit of not needing to download the entire blockchain first.

Because PayPal IS part of the free market and they haven't found out a way. Why should "BitPal" or whoever will become the Bitcoin clone of PayPal end up doing any different?
The problem isn't PayPal, it's the fact that reliably getting money out of Ghana is a difficult problem to solve. "Just use Bitcoin" won't cut it.
So what's funny is the one-sided optimism some people are having toward Bitcoin.

What I'm saying is unlike other games like Satoshi Dice or Roulette or what have you, this has a POSITIVE expected return if you are 93% sure there will be a buyer after you. And this is possible for low amounts (say &lt; 1 BTC)
BTW, there are already a ton of copycats, but none is as popular as bitcoin gem. See 
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:53:37
What looks nice about bitjade is that it's a 20% profit. The problem is that they don't have a Twitter account or something where you can see loads of previous games...so it's hard to be sure there will be a buyer.

I gained like 0.5 coins then lost them again when MtGox crashed - as soon as it was back online I sold but then the course went up instead of down. So I'm back to where I started. Oh well, I assume some people are off worse. Way worse.

"Fuck 'em" is NOT a healthy way to handle your relationship with your parents and will lead to a lot of regret. Please don't throw away your relationship with them just because of money - even if they were the ones who "started" it.

You could ask the same about dollars: "why spend dollars, when you could buy bitcoin which is increasing?" The answer is simple: because you want whatever you are buying with the dollars (aka unbought bitcoin)... the same answer applies to why you would spend bitcoin.

With prices skyrocketing, spending your USD and not buying BTC and hoarding it is madness. Discuss...
@_date: 2013-04-24 08:06:01
The more popular Bitcoin becomes, the higher the price will rise - this will most certainly include many bubbles + crashes along the way.
What's funny is even if Bitcoin is doomed to die, it will die hard and will have many crashes + recoveries along the way.
So unfortunately for the next months, stability is not something we can reasonably expect from Bitcoin.
So here's what I've done: Invest what I can afford to lose, wait &amp; hold without panicking until Bitcoin is 4-5x its original price, then cash out my original investment. Now I'm leaning back and enjoying the rollercoaster ride, using my "free" Bitcoin for purchases or selling a few whenever I need some extra cash. It works for me! :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:58:26

Did something happen or why are people buying like CRAZY the last hour?
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:24:45
By "original price", I mean the price you entered at. So if you're just entering now, you buy, say, 10 BTC @ $150. Then, you just simply sit tight until BTC hits, say, $600. You then sell 2.5 BTC to regain your original investment, and then have 7.5 BTC which is pure profit. Does that make sense?

When all ~21 million bitcoins are produced, how will new transactions be added to the chain - will there still be "mining", just purely for transaction fees, or some other solution?
@_date: 2013-03-26 10:54:59
I just checked and they don't. A really, really dumb implementation.
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:35:03
OK I thought I understood but your comment shows me I don't. How can the difficulty jump, but the blocks still be produced at the same rate as before? I would think difficulty jumps would cause less blocks to be produced?
Or maybe I'm just reading you wrong.
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:32:40
MtGox != Bitcoin. MtGox is just a Bitcoin exchange. Once you have your bitcoin and are not interested in exchanging any more, you should move the Bitcoin into your wallet which is then (pseudo)anonymous.

I'm in it for the long run, but am spending very little so far because IMHO it'd be insane at the rate bitcoin is becoming more and more valuable by the ~~hour~~ minute.
Just want the price to skyrocket and hit something resembling stability for a couple of months... then I'd love to start using it as a currency. Till then, no way am I spending something that will very possibly be worth double in a week - or even 100x or more in a year or whenever it hits mainstream.
Really the only thing I've been "using" Bitcoin for has been for presents for friends and gambling.

What an excellent article - no mindless "told you so" nor a just-as-mindless "now is a GREAT time to buy cheap coin".
What is especially fascinating is the point raised toward the end: is there a de-centralized solution for providing stability? I can think of none - but then on the other hand, until Bitcoin came along, no one could think of a de-centralized solution for a secure and stabile digital currency, either...
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:58:36

@_date: 2013-04-30 08:11:45
Well, starting "small" and replacing online banks, MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, etc. would cause Bitcoin to have a price in the tens of thousands. Once that happens, we can see from there. Actually becoming a "real" global currency will almost certainly be decades away, and by then, who knows whether Internet penetration won't be completely global (satellites + smart phones?)...

If you are going to play the speculation game, you will very, very likely end up losing money especially since the price just keeps going up. If you insist, it seems the best chances for profits are during price corrections. Try and "sense" when one is about to hit, sell and then buy low.
Otherwise I'd counsel you to just hang on for the ride and cash out small amounts along the way.
@_date: 2013-07-08 14:04:00
My guess would be that one of the persons you sold / bought bitcoins to/from over the past few weeks is involved in some money laundering which then causes red flags to show up in any accounts of people they did business with.
I doubt this is a specific anti-bitcoin attack, just a downside of a large percentage of bitcoin users currently using bitcoin for illegal purposes: makes it difficult to trade bitcoins with strangers...
