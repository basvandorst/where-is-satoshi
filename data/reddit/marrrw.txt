No way

As far as I remember, Tim bought at least 30k btc for about 600$, which was above market prices at that moment. Also remember how people were laughing at him, when btc fell to ~200$ several months later.

Roger know its his last chance to save bcash. Since LN &amp; sidechains (like rootstock) are adopted, there will be no point of using this coin.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:40:33
I dont understand why this is not one of the top posts today. Roostock is great, almost ready scaling solution, which can be one of the biggest improvements for bitcoin ever created. Im really excited about it, and cannot wait till it gets released on the mainnet and become widely adopted.

I'd add huobi &amp; okcoin to our wishlist.
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:10:56
Currently there are no proofs that their funds were stolen, they had some connectivity problems since yesterday. So I suggest to stay calm and not panic

bitcoin = digital gold
bcash = digital pyrite

The launch of the service will take place in 3 stages.
At the first stage, the old company (with which you have signed an offer contract) will prepare and transfer to the new company digital personal data of users, in full compliance with the European directives on personal data and in compliance with European legislation in this field.
Terms of transfer until 15.09.2017
In the second stage, the licensed financial investment company, assumes the task of restoring the digital assets of the new company and registering digital data of users at home.
In the third stage, the licensed financial investment company will audit and register personal data in accordance with AML laws and KYC identification procedures.
In the future, this financial company will operate under its financial license both digital and monetary data.
In parallel with the legal issue of restructuring, users will be given the opportunity to check the integrity of the digital balance in the user's account, and users will be able to make changes in the security of the account. For chat and support, chat will be available.
For these purposes, the service will be launched on the old domain (btc-e.nz). You will be able to log in and check your balance before recounting.
Term before 02.09.2017
Since there is a risk of third-party access to account accounts and to protect users' digital balances, it is highly recommended that you update the security and identification settings. Instructions for these actions will be duplicated by a separate news item.
The helpdesk system will be operated by the licensed financial company after the start of the digital data transfer procedure. After starting the service from the financial company and in case you have difficulties with entering the account or there are inaccuracies in the balance, you can get help and answers through the ticket system.
The following information update will be released on 01/09/2017
If you have any questions we are ready to answer them.
How will the balances be recalculated?
This information will be published in the next updates.
What is the domain for the new service and what is the financial company?
This information will be published before September 15, 2017

I think it's a good news generally, for all the time I assumed my money on btce is lost 
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:43:58
As far as I understood - if you had only fiat, eg 1000$, you'll receive 550bte and the rest 450$ in various coins.
Source - this part:
"If you have a balance in BTE, then you will be credited with 45% in koin (the amount will be divided into 7 different coins equally BTC, LTC, NMC, NVC, PPC, ETH, DSH) and write off the amount of 45% in BTE."

It is very good. Remember that supporting new currency is additional cost for exchanges, for some of them it may be simple, for others not. Don't expect all exchanges to support each crappy fork of bitcoin. They can, but it depends of them, and Im okay with that. if you don't like this policy, just withdraw your coins before fork. Actually that's what bitmex guys wrote on their blog:
"BitMEX reserves the right to credit forks or not – in the presence of doubt, always withdraw first."

Little bird told me about ~120k bch
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:19:02
Same things already happened many times, they will fix it soon probably.
I had the same errors serveral times yesterday
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:48:57
LTC also has most of the code similar to bitcoin - still is an altcoin
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:16:43
On or before 31 December 2017:​
The amount of Bitcoin Cash a user is entitled to is determined by their Margin Balance at 1 August 2017 13:17 UTC, a few seconds after block 478,588.
Users will not receive Bitcoin Cash, rather BitMEX **will sell all users’ Bitcoin Cash, and credit their wallet with the Bitcoin proceeds.**

Incoming transactions ;) People are sending small amounts to Satoshi, I guess it's just for fun
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:47:57
Its temporary guys... Bitcoin will have rootstock in few weeks, I guess most small transactions will be performed on rsk/other sidechains - and later, by LN
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:26:55
Why you think they'll dump it all at once? For sure they'll be slowly dumping, maybe they already started as bcash is very expensive now
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:49:29
AFAIK, in case of bitmex derivatives, they don't need to own any bcash coins. Bcash derivatives will be based on poloniex bch/btc price, thats it.

He's just trolling. Read his previous tweets + the other answers from his twitter 'poll', he is having a great fun of you lol
@_date: 2016-09-28 13:21:07
So why people on keep talking there is no working implementation of LN? Any arguments, or it's just another silly FUD?
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:32:30
What kind of exchange is it? Why they reveal informations about buyers?
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:42:21
Ok, in response to my own question:
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:44:03
Here is little more info about what they exactly were trading: 
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:58:59
It was consumed very easily, looks like wash trading for me
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:12:35
Looks like some displaying problem, now I dont see such trades
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:57:25
I think in few years it will be sth like- "Bitcoin would be at 100k$ if we would have bigger blocks" ~Roger Ver on twitter
And topics on r/btc: 
-"When bitcoin cash will finally break 400$?"
-"Calm down man, it's a long term investment. Wait another few years"
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:04:14
Maybe I missed sth, but... which stolen kraken funds?
@_date: 2016-10-17 14:57:53
Everything is in miners hands. I hope they'll make a responsible decision, and won't play politics.

I'd prefer him to come back to prison.
@_date: 2018-04-07 12:55:49
**LOL look what I found**
Check out his blog - you'll find a lot of two-spaces between sentences in his posts

It's funny how some people in bitcoin community easily forget that Satoshi didn't create this limit without any reason, and they think that removing it will solve all scalability problems.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:36:00
So finally Ethereum killer is ready, and will be released very soon. Am I the only one who thinks it is (one of) the most important bitcoin project ever created? Assuming that segwit will be finally deployed (which means, fully trustless RSK) - will there be any ethereum advantage over bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:27:24
with segwit, it is
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:57:01
I'd love to see an answer @_date: 2016-10-04 12:50:08
"no one wants"? I suggest you to leave r/btc just for a while, and you'll see that most of serious people in bitcoin industry including miners, exchanges etc consider 2nd layer technologies as a real solution of bitcoin scalability problems. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:11:32
Costs of switching from eth to rsk will be very tiny, as they are fully compatible. I bet most of the big eth projects will be ported to rsk (because, why not? it won't cost much). Bitcoin is still far more popular and recognizable, so I'm pretty sure RSK will take great part of ETH market.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:43:16
same with btc.top, it's not just possible, its almost certain
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:21:55
Doesn't change anything, stolen rsk coins = stolen bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:33:04
It's really strange, I had the same config like OP (only for withdraw), and I also considered it perfectly safe. 
Kraken shouldn't allow to change this settings without providing 2fa code, now it totally makes no sense to setup this. It's also really dangerous, as probably many users use same config
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:07:10
Im not afraid at all, ETH can overtake BTC in marketcap for a short moment, but it doesn't change anything. ETH bubble will burst very hard, after coins from ICOs will finally be cashed out. Holding ETH at this moment is insane. It's pure gamble.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:30:13
I he'd like to have Segwit, he wouldn't stall it for the last ~8 months
