You can fork the project and make the changes on your own version of the software. You can learn to build it an have your own executable of deluge. You can then submit a pull request an the maintainers can take a look. Theyll probably be more likely to take a pull req than a plead to fix an issue. Think of it as a learning experience and a way to contribute to free software. Of course, it all depends if you want to do it or not. Keep in mind the people working in the project have their own lives and this is most likely a side project for them and not a source of income.
Props to looking into it so far! If you have questions on this kind of stuff, feel free to ask me. I might look into it myself later.

No prob. So Python is an interpretive language and doesn't get compiled. Instead, Python code gets fed into an interpreter an instructions are run as they're read in.
That being said, if you wanted to distribute a Python project easily to others, there are libraries out there that will package up a Python project into an installer for whatever platform you're targeting. For this project, they use:
bbfreeze for Windows: 
Here's how to make the .app for OSX: 
If you have Python installed, you can also just install the Python code by following the front page readme:

It is open source, though. If you really want the fix you can look into it yourself and submit a pull req.
