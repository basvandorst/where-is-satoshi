This is such a good guide, thank-you!
I'm actually following it to set up a BTC full node on mainnet (without lightning) and once Lightning is stable on mainnet I'll add support (using this guide again).

That was a great read!, very eloquently written, thanks for sharing. I don't normally make it through longer posts, but yours was genuinely very interesting/engaging and I am impressed with your ingenuity and mettle despite your early years.
Best of luck with your future endeavours, I am sure there will be a great many of them!

Looking at the screenshot it appears to still be syncing the block chain (it's at 0.27%.. has a LOOOONG way to go yet), from what I remember my Pi had real trouble with any sort of inbound connection until the chain was fully synced.

This worked for me:

Looks like you are waiting for the Pi to do a full blockchain sync. Having been through this earlier in the year it will take about 6 weeks.. when I did it my Pi had just finished syncing and then something went wrong (power outage) and the chain was borked and the node wouldn't start. I had to start again.
I would highly recommend downloading the full blockchain from somewhere, or if that option isn't available, installing the Node sortware on a powerful desktop PC and letting that do the full sync and validate.
That's what I did the second time round as I couldn't wait another 6 weeks for it to do the lot again.
I did this; and I also maintain a backup of the blockchain on my PC so if something goes wrong with the Pi in the future, I have the fully validated chain ready to go.
EDIT:  I notice someone has said much the same thing in the conv. threads

Is it still in the process of syncing?, Mine didn't show up on bitnodes until it had fully synced the Blockchain
