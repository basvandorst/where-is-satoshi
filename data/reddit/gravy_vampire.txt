Based on what?
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:41:36
Yes and no. Clearly everything is flat between those mini pumps/dumps. Small guys are holding at this point, but perhaps one of those whales may want to take it lower.

This is very likely an attempt to temporarily lower the price of Bitcoin so that he and/or his cronies can load up before a big pump; this has been his standard operating procedure for playing the stock market over the last year.
I fully expect to see positive Bitcoin tweets from this dingus in a few days.

Did you read the methodology? Do you know how surveys work?
Do you understand that the title is misleading because it should say "19% of the 13,434 people surveyed said they had previously bought bitcoin?" Did you even get to the part where only 6% of people surveyed said they use cryptocurrencies still? 5% of those surveyed said they used cryptocurrencies before, but now they no longer do. The rest of the 89% in that section said they have never used cryptocurrencies.
Do you understand that only 22 countries were surveyed, and that they don't even list the countries? I'm guessing they were some of the more modern countries with modern communication technology, or else they probably wouldn't be able to communicate with this "worldwide" survey. Do you know what selection bias is?
Maybe you should read through this thing more critically instead of just regurgitating a headline.

1: Trump spews random shit out of his mouth all the time without ever actually following through, then his dementia-riddled mind wanders on to the next topic a day or two later. This is why he no longer talks or cares about a wall across the Mexican border, this is why he never actually took everyone's guns and didn't ever "worry about due process later". So spare me the idea that you actually know what Trump is going to do about crypto a day or two from now.
2. Anyone who spouts specific price targets like "5k by october/november" is a joke. You have absolutely no basis for that prediction.

I think you may have misinterpreted OP's comment to mean they were saying that the price *is* being purposefully kept down, but I think OP was just asking if that was possible, rather than stating such was the case.
I would hope you wouldn't be so rude to someone if you knew they were just wondering aloud, but I can understand why you'd be annoyed if you thought u/tedgmon was stating that thought as if it were fact.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:41:01
He's just saying this because yesterday he tried doing the whole "I was right" thing before the huge dump today. So he had to come up with a reason why the dump was much later than he predicted in order to maintain the self-delusion.

The halvening won’t *cause* a price decrease, but price decreases are definitely possible after the halvening.
A price decrease after a halvening seems less likely than a price increase given what we’ve witnessed after the previous halvenings.
Does that make sense?

@_date: 2019-11-21 19:58:11
The price was lower than it is now for 10.5 of the 12 months in 2017. 
That’s over 85% of the year you could have bought and you’d still be green right now.
If you bought in the first half of 2017 you’d be up somewhere between 300-900% right now

Not true at all. It’s about the amount of bitcoin being sold vs bought, not the number of people buying vs selling.
If you have 10,000 people buying 1 satoshi and 1 person selling 10,000 bitcoin, the price will go down even though the number of people buying bitcoin is 10,000x higher.

I know you probably discard any news story you don’t like, but Donald Trump’s tax documents for many years are publicly available on the internet, showing he lost about $1 billion dollars over a 9 year period. He literally claimed more losses than any US taxpayer ever.

Not a coincidence. Money is quickly yanked out of the markets as a reaction to the tariffs and uncertainty, and a small percentage of that money is transferred into Bitcoin.

Correct. I think people who are invested in Bitcoin at this point are unlikely to want to exchange their Bitcoin for currencies that are struggling while economies struggle.

The people in charge of the US right now are doing everything in their power to dismantle US democracy in favor of power for corporations and the wealthy elites. In fact, it’s been a constant effort going on like 4 decades now.
Democracy is simply incompatible with the way central banks, corporations, and wealthy elites would like to rule without being held accountable. 
I think we agree in that these people will do what mentioned to keep their power, but there’s no way in hell they do that in the name of preserving Democracy, and it’s quite the opposite in reality.

It’s like when some guy says “Space mining and Millennials is the reason Gold is obsolete?“ when his peer never said this would be the only reason gold is obsolete 
Maybe an honest arguer would say something like “Space mining and Millennials is **a** reason Gold is obsolete?” But you’re too worried about winning some non-argument to do that with intellectual honesty
