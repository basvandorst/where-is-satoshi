Yeah, that’s kinda what I’m looking for. 
Have you used Bitstamp? I haven’t read anything about it. Is it a good platform?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:54:08
Thats a good way to put it. Haha
So yeah, only invest what I’m willing to loose.

Ohhhh... so close!!

Huh, that’s to bad. I’m in America so I wouldn’t be able to sign up for a Binance account? 
And yes, I would be trading fiat for crypto initially.

So I was thinking about buying a small amount of bitcoin for the first time and see what I can do with it. 
How much do you think a good initial investment would be? I was even thinking about making two portfolios, that way I could test some strangeies independently from each other to see what works and what doesn’t. 
Is this a bad idea? 
Let me know your thoughts. 
Thanks.

Hey, thanks for the info. Very helpful. I have been reading about the market concerns. Definitely reason to be concerned no matter how you look at it. But what are you going to do? There’s not a ton of options.

There’s no reason I couldn’t have two wallets separate from each other? Right? I could use two different trading platforms. Or I could have two separate accounts on the same platform? Am I wrong? Or could that work? 
Hey, on a side note. Does anyone know about a good iOS app for bitcoin? It would be nice to be able to do more from my cell phone.
