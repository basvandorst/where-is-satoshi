It was great to chat with Glenn alongside with Jeffrey and Kristov about Bitcoin. He is tremendously interested and certainly can help expand the Bitcoin community.

Great to just get more women involved. There are tons of opportunities for men and women and right now more women can jump into the Bitcoin space.

Women often make many financial decisions in households and they certainly should be encouraged to transact in Bitcoin to stimulate the already growing BTC economy.
