Transaction fee varies greatly over time. Yesterday you'd pay 30 satoshi/byte to get it processes fast, today just 10. It all depends on how many unprocessed transactions there are and how many of them get processed each block. Websites like  are good to use for the estimation.
To everyone asking which wallet to use, on PC Bitcoin Core and Electrum allow to specify custom fee amounts. You need to enable that option in Electrum's settings. No idea about other wallets.
I see a lot of you whining about Coinbase. Coinbase doesn't allow to specify a fee, they chose it for you, so there is nothing you can do there, you are not in control of Coinbase's wallet as far as fees and private keys go. Get a better wallet or convince Coinbase to fix their shit if you care.

Sure, why now?


Don't wait a dip, just buy it, transfer it to a wallet (paper wallet?) that you keep safe, and forget about it for 10 years.

Coinbase has one of the lowest fees I know and they will not screw you, they are a large US company that is legally liable for shit (looking at you Mt. Gox). All the places that don't require identification have higher bitcoin price "for insurance", something like $1000, if not more, on top of the current bitcoin price. So if the current bitcoin price is $4600, they will charge you $5600 per bitcoin. You are better off using Coinbase or similar services that have a big company behind them and require identity. The only downside with this is that Coinbase will tell IRS and credit bureaus about you buying/selling bitcoins, since all financial institutions in US are required to do that for US citizens, so you better not do anything illegal and pay up taxes. That's assuming you are a US citizen. Don't know the implications for citizens of other countries.

They won't teach you about Bitcoin, but it might get a mentioning. What is there to teach about it anyway? There is nothing special about Bitcoin from financial point of view. It can be viewed as any regular financial asset. The special part is the technology behind it, the blockchain, and then it's very simple and a couple of lectures is enough to cover Bitcoin's blockchain in-debpth. I could see Bitcoin blockchain covered in a Bachelor/Master's level lecture of a Computer Science department.

Hardware wallets are overrated.
If you don't want to store private keys on your machine, then just don't. Create a paper wallet while offline in some Linux live CD, record it down, and add it as watch-only wallet on your online system. If you need to send bitcoins somewhere, boot up the Linux live CD, create a cold-storage wallet using the private key from the paper wallet, create a signed transaction and transfer it to an online machine. If you have an old phone, you don't even need to mess with Linux live CD.

Now tell them that all transactions in Bitcoin are public and you can easily download a database of all transactions that were ever made, i.e. the blockchain.

Coinbase is fine.
If you are planning on holding them for long time, like several years, a paper wallet created on offline computer might be a good idea.

This is something you could easily google up, no need to create posts for such silly things.
