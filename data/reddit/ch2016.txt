Thanks that’s exactly my whole feeling on the situation. Said money wasn’t earned it was won on a bet so I thought I wanna do something meaningful with it I wanna take the risk. I don’t know too much about bitcoin apart from my gut feeling that I need to invest in some.

I have hardly anything in crypto yet just a bit here and there. I decided to stop talking about it to other people who aren’t into it or are too lazy to research what ever they see outside there normal news cycle. People seem really eager to tell you it’s a bubble or it’s crashed or what ever so I gave up trying to be enthusiastic about it with people who aren’t involved.

Hey guys I was wondering if Someone could help me. I recently came into some money about 1200 quid. Would it be worth taking a trip to my local bit atm and depositing it in there? I’ve always wanted to own some anyway and was wondering if it would be worth it over just letting it sit in a savings account. I wouldn’t need or touch this 1200 quid either way.

What is the story behind the guy who was supposed to be the CO Founder of Bit Coin selling all his stuff? Id like to know the inside track as I keep getting tagged in stories about it on Facebook from my non crypto currency friends like it’s the end of life itself.
