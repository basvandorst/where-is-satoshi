Apparently clicking on your username and reading for 5 seconds makes me obsessed with you.
If you really think my online behaviour is so out of line with your expectations that it confirms your impression that I'm mentally unstable, you are living in denial about how the average internet user interacts on the web.
All I'm doing is going around and making fun of how blatantly stupid your comments are. You think this warrants calling me mentally unstable and that I am obsessed, fine. I think you saying that just gives me more ammunition in entertaining myself with *your* online behaviour (that you seem to take a million times more seriously than me, must have more karma!).
I'm glad you finally finalized your impression of me though. I'd sized you up like the insect you are from your first reply. Guess some people just have a knack for... not being as retarded as you?

Lol going through your post history is great. Additional proof of your ignorance is just littered everywhere.
Now I know you understand Bitcoin just as well as you do Spotify's business!

Sorry I'm not putting too much weight behind the words of someone who is as retarded as you.
I gotta say though I love that you're still coming back to get some more poop smeared all over your face. Although I wish you'd make it a bit of a challenge. Bullying insects ain't making me break much of a sweat.
