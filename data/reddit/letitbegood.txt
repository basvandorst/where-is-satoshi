Buying a used ledger is not an issue so long as one generates a new wallet/recovery seed. The idea of that you never know if a ledger has been tampered with, but this should not be a worry because of the ability to generate a new wallet.

For the record, he never said it’s going to $20. He just said to not buy if you couldn’t handle a crash to $20. This goes for any crypto. Right now LTC is working on some pretty cool things (LN, atomic swaps, new payment services announced) and I expect there will be some solid upside moving forward.

Thanks everyone for your responses, much appreciated.  
One last thing I'm curious about: I noticed that several of the inputs connected to my transaction were for very small amounts, much less than the amounts of the bitcoin purchases I made through Coinbase.  If I make a bitcoin purchase through Coinbase (say for .2 BTC), is it possible that the deposit for .2 BTC that I receive is broken up into many smaller outputs instead of a single output for .2 BTC?  Or maybe I'm not making any sense here...

My understanding is that Coinbase no longer pays the fee, which is a part of my confusion on all of this.  
Since my Coinbase wallet deducted 0.2504972 BTC and my Copay wallet received .25 BTC, that would only leave .0004972 for the fee.  Yet the blockchain shows the fee was 0.0213356 BTC.  Is it possible the fee was spread out between several users?  For some reason I thought the fee shown  on the blockchain is for one particular transaction.  I wasn't aware that transactions can be bundled?
