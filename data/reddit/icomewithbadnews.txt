Hopefully this is something that gets addressed in the near future. So far the answers from the bitcoin enthusiasts on twitter seem to be that the gigantic energy needs of the BTC Network will help spur on the development of more efficient energy production methods which is a total cop out and shitty answer. Or they engage in whattaboutism and point to gold mining. If it is true that in 18 months the network will be consuming as much energy as the United States, well that is reprehensible and indefensible.

What additional documentation do they need anyway? And what if you’re not an accredited investor but simply an early adopter now sitting on large amounts? Coinbase in Canada doesn’t even let you sell BTC, only to buy. Forget about changing it into fiat and withdrawing large amounts

Great write up but I feel you were too soft on “Technical analysis”, which is nothing short of astrology. Unfortunately it suckers some newbies because it has cool looking charts and fancy ‘technical” terms like “bollinger bands”. Take it from a finance MA, technical analysis is essentially fortune telling and crystal balls dressed up in fancy finance lingo. It’s utter garbage and isn’t useful, even as a tool (an oft-heard defense of that whole hocus pocus bs).

I’m always skeptical about these ‘cashing out’ posts regarding larger amounts. How does one exactly cash out say, 1 million USD worth of bitcoin anyway? That isn’t possible on any online exchange. Bitcoin is highly illiquid, even getting 10k out of the exchanges is a gigantic headache

Also he’s 25 and making &gt;200k USD/year. Seems legit

Would you happen to know where to buy Bitcoin in Canada (preferably hassle free) apart from coinbase? I'm still stuck at a shitty 1000 CAD per week purchase limit (despite jumping through all the hoops and getting my ID verified) and I have a fair amount of cash sitting which I would like to buy coins with.

I pity people who believe these posts. Along with the “it’s just the whales manipulating the price to hoard more BTC, keep buying peasants!”

What if governments ban the exchanges as well as banning the use of BTC as currency? Sure the network itself may not be affected but make no mistake the price would plummet as there would be no way to make use of the coins. Let’s be honest the vast majority of bitcoiners right now are speculators and would not stick with something illegal purely for ideological reasons. 
Please don’t downvote I would actually like to read people’s thoughts on this.

Btc is not banned in either of those countries.

Thanks. I was thinking in the tens of thousands. Good to hear though regarding the ease of conversion in 100k's. Unfortunately Coinbase doesn't allow sale of BTC for Canadians so I will likely be using a physical exchange and was wondering what kind of restrictions/regulations come into play then.

Let’s be honest bro you don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about, and that’s okay. No one does. It’s just jarring to see people make these kind of definitive statements with no reserve. 
Bitcoin is a new paradigm, no one knows where it’s headed or what the market will be like in the future.

Is that true in regards to larger sums? Sincerely asking since so far I've only been a buyer. Buying on coinbase and moving to private wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:05:36
I will, thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:00:40
Thanks again

Thank you. What wallet would you recommend for storing them on personal laptop? I've been meaning to move my coins from coin base and have ordered a Trezor (I've seen it recommend everywhere for cold storage) but haven't received it yet and probably will not until after August 1st.

Pardon my ignorance, but where can I get more info on this? I have a few bitcoins on my coin base account. How will they be affected?

How does Breadwallet compare with Electrum?
