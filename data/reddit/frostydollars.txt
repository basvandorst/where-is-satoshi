If you hold long-term, it doesn't matter.  You take more risk at the front end by investing  a large lump sum.  The risk starts to build as you go down the road, as you have more invested.  If you stay in for the long haul, you should be okay.

Bitcoin now is really ripe for buy and hold. No timing.  You buy at different prices--it's called dollar cost averaging. By doing this, you mitigate your risk.  Once bought, HOLD, no matter what. At such time that you can cash some coin in to recover your initial investment, then do that..but continue to HOLD.  We are in the very early stages of the price cycle.

I'll buy it--how about 350? I can pay in crypto.  How about 300 in crypto and 50 in PayPal…that way we both have protection.  Thank you, Jim

I am a fairly new user of Coinbase.  My experience with them has been very professional.  They are not a fly by night outfit.  They are a group of very smart people who want Bitcoin to succeed.  I'd give these folks the highest recommendation.

Life is messy.  Every new invention goes through an adoption period, while it is tweaked.  This could take a decade.  At any rate, its a new invention that needs to be enhanced. If you don't like Bitcoin, don't buy it.  It's pretty simple

I think they are in over their heads.  But, Brian is a very smart dude.  He will figure things out--he has to if he wants Amazon to buy them out!

With Overstock coming on board in a few months, the others will have to follow….EBAY, AMAZON, etc. They have to--they lose a competitive advantage if they don't.  The system will work out very nicely….it just takes time.

I use CB too.  They are the best.

Dollar cost average.  Buy different amounts at different prices on a regular basis, and HOLD.  Statistics show over and over that "daytraders" fail miserably in the end.  While there are successful multi-trade speculators, they are in the minority.

I am a Coinbase customer. I have nothing but good things to say about them. They always do the right thing.I think they are a little slow to respond because they are short-staffed.

I'm with Coinbase too.  And I do trust them. They are US-based,and use bank protocol security.  I'll bet they begin to insure against loss very soon…they have to, to protect their market share.

I think even at 1 BTC, if you have 50 BTCs to store, it's a bargain.  Losing 50 BTCs is a bad day, to say the least.

Still in the box? Has it been used?  How much do you want for it?  I'm just dipping my toes in the bit coin pool, so I could pay via PayPal if the price is right. 
Thank you. Jim

It's really about supply and demand.  If TREZOR's price does not attract enough buyer's, the inventors will have to lower the price--it's that simple. There are other alternatives.  Frankly, I like the Piper, but its not quite as convenient as TREZOR.

I think Jeff will pony up and buy Coinbase--that guy is brilliant.
