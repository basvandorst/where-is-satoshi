I forgot to say thank you since it was so late.  I really appreciate it and your tip allowed me to transfer out to my personal wallet.  Thank you, again!

OK, I just realized that the minimum to move out is like $0.45 (at the moment).  I'm not completely familiar with the breakdown into units yet, so I thought ChangeTip was trying to get me to add more to get more fees.  Not even worried about $0.45...herp derp on me.

Generous, indeed!  Thx!

Damn, son!  You're not messing around with your tips.

Perfect!  Thanks!

What's stopping ChangeTip from taking all the coins on their site (that no one can withdraw for 10 years)?  Seems suspicious IMO.  
I'm into quality; not quantity, so good luck with your two-headed salamander.  ;)

I just wanted to say thank you for the note about my hot wallet not being compromised (I felt the same way, but needed another opinion).  I just set up paper wallet and it worked great.  I feel so much better about, and I can monitor on Blockchain instead of Coinbase.  It really is easy to keep it in your own hands with the QR codes and all that.

I do spend it on occasion, so I like to have it ready to go and Coinbase is easy.  
I guess I'm being lazy about biting the bullet and doing the paper wallet.  It's just easier to have it on Coinbase, but I realize the risks now that I have (what I consider) are decent amount of coin.
What is the danger of doing it the 'quick and easy' way from [this guide](
The Easy Method
This method is probably suitable for small quantities of bitcoin. I would not trust it for life-altering sums of money.
1.Download the bitaddress.org website to your hard drive.
2.Close your browser
3.Disconnect from the internet
4.Open the bitaddress.org website from your hard drive.
5.Print a paper wallet on your printer
6.Close your browser

Ahh, I see.  Thank you.  And to the OC's comment, it is ironic indeed.

I looked up fiat, but I'm not completely sure of its meaning (other than I'm waiting for the transaction to finalize).  I know I bought at a particular rate, but why the wait?  Thanks.
