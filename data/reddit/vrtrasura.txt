God dammit.  Another day, another Roger Ver performance that will absolutely win over anyone who is not technical (most people).  
 
Jimmy let him do his "demo" without explaining well that bcash has no traffic volume, or explaining that all coins will have this scaling issue.  He never questioned how many inputs and outputs the transaction had.  Never pointed out that fees are always overpaid (my low fee transactions always go through, am I just lucky?). 
  
The one spot where Jimmy had chance to show why spam is a problem his audio cut out!  The nodes are a part of the market.  The size of blocks does matter.  Spam is not worth nodes storing them forever in the future for no cost.  
 
 
We need to shut down Roger's arguments with straight facts, not a bunch of innuendo about technicalities.

Good explanation!
To rephrase to show I understand- it would be really easy for Bob to get ALL the funds in the channel if Alice tried to do this to you because he can choose what fee to pay and all he has to do is pay a big enough fee to get it into the chain within the 1000 block timeout.
Q: You stated any fee can be used but isn't what Bob posts to the chain pre-populated with a fee already?  How does Bob change the fee in it?

Hi bloXroute,
  
I'd like to share my perspective.  There are different kinds of lightning node uses.  Also, agree with other responder- LN doesn't have to be nearly as decentralized as the layer 1 is, it is for a different use model.    
If you want to make a routing node, yes it should be online all the time so it can route stuff.  Yes, you would want watchtowers to mitigate risk.  Yes you may want to rebalance to mitigate risk.  All the complex stuff is for this type of node.  Security is a *huge* deal since it is a live hot wallet.
  
If you want to have a node on your phone that you mainly buy things with, it doesn't need to be online all the time.  I would argue that you may not even need watch towers, I don't think Starbucks would try to close with old channel state, especially when my payments will be going *to* them instead of *to* me.  I would also not load enough money into my phone lightning node to care if I lost it, similar to how much USD cash I keep in my wallet in my pocket.  This kind of node I would connect on the fringe of the network to a reliable node rather than open up a bunch of channels.    
This kind of usage scales bitcoin so much.  Only big transactions need to be on chain and justify the fees.  We don't really need a record of every Starbucks purchase held on chain forever.  LN makes it so we don't have to.  Even if you opened a single 1 to 1 channel between you and Starbucks with $100 this saves layer 1 space, it's like a gift card right?  The cool part is, that you can use that gift care through Starbucks node to get to anywhere else too.  Long story short, LN nodes have many purposes and levels of risk the node owner is willing to tolerate, but they all of help preserve space on the main chain.

So conspiracy, much drama.  
Seriously no facts in this video.  Creator fails to mention segwit being delayed for a year when it was a block size increase by the devs he says would raise the block size.  That along with batching has kept fees low since the peak, video hasn't aged well. Also fails to explain that the Bitcoin cash attack stole hash rate with the DAA and that was a large contributor to long block times and higher fees. Lightning nodes are easy to set up, anyone can compete with one, there's no barrier to entry.  AML/KYC fud is the same thing people used to say about regular Bitcoin nodes...  In the end no money is transferred until the final signed images are broadcast to the block chain, its more like updating a contract than having IOUs as the author stated.   Lastly there is just as much conspiracy around the big blocker movement if you are into that kind of thing (asic boost, bitmain centralization advantages, coinbase filling blocks without batching), why does the author ignore it?
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:15:12
I can't find a really good answer for this.  Channel timeouts seem free, but what fee is used for closing a channel is nebulous.  Can someone use RBF or CPFP to accelerate the closing broadcast?
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:39:44
No, as you stated there's only one entry in the block chain for opening the channel and we could use a different one to open a new channel.
I was thinking the attacker for this would be the party you have a channel open with.  Every channel update is a multi-sig signing event with the same address I think.  Kind of a strange counter party risk... Not sure it is real, hence the question.
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:55:46
The fees are in the multisig message the parties share?  If so this is completely not possible.  I'll try to google that a bit, don't know why I didn't think of it. Thanks!

"Won’t a PoW change benefit BITMAIN the most?
This is total nonsense."
Some feedback for you, try to make way better points with data if you want people to listen.  Bitmain has billions of dollars in the bank they could use to outspend anyone else to the new POW algo, you have zero analysis on this.  In general, ASIC resistance is futile- you have zero analysis on this.  These ASICs are what makes Bitcoin the hardest chain to attack (if you are not Bitmain), you have zero analysis on the risk of opening us up to all attackers rather than just one at the switch point- or acknowledge we would not want to compete against other coins for hash rate if possible.  What should we switch to? Zero analysis on that as well.
Right now the only options are to support alternatives to fund competition (put your money where your mouth is as some of us have), or come up with something that is actually ASIC resistant and push for that.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:12:10
I wonder how you find a trusted part to be the third party for you...?  Seems against what we are trying to do.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:11:30
We can't make sense of this without knowing how many small inputs do you have?  I moved something with 100's of inputs for $10 two days ago.  Otherwise- wait for the mem pool to go down or manually choose something lower and see if you get lucky. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:17:31
Also- best not forget that horses got us this far! Why would we change the model!?
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:41:53
These arguments are so disingenuous it's hard to take them seriously.  
Digital things are something, that is why Microsoft, Google, and Facebook are high earning companies that at points had no physical objects to sell.  Peter would not like it if we deleted all of his digital data because it is something of value to him.  
At global scale gold mining will still be more expensive and pollute more than Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin mining will eventually be all green energy...  
Gold is not easy to transfer and has immense costs post mining.  Any significant wealth transfer with gold requires many armed guards, armored vehicles, fortified storage and complex testing to make sure the bards aren't plated tungsten.    
Gold can store value (in a safe or Fort Knox), be used in jewelry or corrosion plating (burn rate), be traded with others (but it is hard to verify), but has unknown issuance from mining. Bitcoin can store value (you get be your own Fort Knox), be a banking system (not rely on trusted 3rd parting clearing events), be used as in person non-counterfeit cash (transfer with anyone easily verified), and has a fixed issuance rate that will eventually drop to 0.  
In summary, Bitcoin has many of the same use cases of gold but performs them in a better way.  Bitcoin &gt; gold.

Open source projects don't work how you think they do.  Anyone can contribute, no one company is deciding what happens.
Chaincode submits more than blockstream, why not complain about them? 
Core is not a company it is an open source group.  I think all this vilification of core derives from the contributors rejecting the plebeian ideas of businessmen.  Building this SW project is harder than building a business- every decision affects EVERY user (business or not)... Being methodical and justifying every change is the right thing to do.  If anything you should be reading more articles about how segwit and educating us rather than statements like "they are ruining this coin".  
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:22:23
The next time this happens:  
Lighting will be unaffected  
The attacker will have to commit much more $ to attack the bigger blocks (segwit)  
The attacker will have less contention from other users (most exchanges/businesses are batching now)  
  
In addition any attacker will know that it didn't kill the chain before and therefore be less incentivized to try the attack in the first place.

Satoshi didn't pick the best proof of work, or see ASIC's coming at all for that matter.

This is an example of him winning :(  
He comes across as well mannered, rational... even visionary.  
We need to refute his attacks the same matter.  We need simple statements that refute his bullshit claims.  We need to press the importance of censorship resistance.  We need to sell the capability and the plan of the open source team.  I'm legit concerned that we're going to lose market share only because he's a good salesman.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:35:25
Totally true.
Maybe John could have made a bigger point by showing Rogers direct support of classic-&gt;XT-&gt;bcash to prove he's had an axe to grind with bitcoins open source developers rather than just triggering him by saying bcash over and over. Discussing why bcash is an ok name was fine, but the bigger point was never made right?
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:13:14
Great job using LN as a straw man.  
If we only cared about the short term we could have activated segwit a year earlier. By this point % of segwit transactions would be higher and the mem pool would be lower.  Perhaps then the devs would have had more time to work on the whatever is the next improvement sooner.  
Back to the real point.  Without decentralization this project doesn't mean anything. One must either agree with that statement or not.  Do you?  
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:23:08
I get where you are at, I used to try to sell people on Bitcoin the same way...  The questions is: why should every full node store your 2 kB transaction for you for all of the future?  There has to be a way to arbitrate who gets access to that perpetual storage cost, fees are the only way. Low fees were a just a side benefit of near zero adoption- they will continue to exist until true scaling innovations (like LN or other) are developed.
Decentralization/trustless operation is what makes Bitcoin revolutionary and thus the important feature that must guide development. Scaling will happen later but should never be at the expense of what is unique about bitcoin.  Adoption will continue to happen regardless of fees because our tech is already truly revolutionary.

Man I'd love to jump on the Roger is emotionally unstable train but really...  I think for newcomers who watch this it will seem like Roger won the debate- he might just come off as passionate rather than a nut job.  
I hate that he wins every debate I see him in.  The reason?  Because he hammers simple to understand points.  They are pure bullshit and irrelevant points, but he makes them seem relevant. We haven't had anyone shoot down each point properly in a debate yet.  It needs to be crystal clear that he is malicious but we haven't made it stick.
A similar style of salesmanship was employed by Trump in the election.  It works... We need to have simple effective meme type rebuttals for each argument.

It's already succeeded more than I would like despite the rage quit.  "Not the original whitepaper" crap is so easy to understand and repeat that it's catching on.  
We need to have real data that shows bcash is a joke.  It would be great to show that, I don't know, 99.98% of the code is "stolen" from bitcoin (disclaimer, I'm making it up, I don't know how much).  That's a statement that we could state clearly that shows that bitcoin core is the real bitcoin and bears the responsibility for our success so far.

Moderation of reddit threads is normal and prudent, I don't mind at all if they block spam threads about alts etc...  I'd rather peruse high value content.
If legit threads come up to discuss how we will compete with other alts or adopt successful ideas from an alt we should be able to debate that in my opinion.  
Thing is, that's not what people bring. 
Whenever I go to the other subreddit and look at "I got banned" type posts it's always because they were spewing zero value content into this subreddit and directly insulting everyone.  As an example your post has no content, only an assertion with no backup.  What are they doing to boost and influence their reach?  Provide evidence of manipulation is going on...  Think about the source you site in context instead of just agreeing with it on the surface too, you may realize it's inspired content...  If you do find something I may have the same chance to see a bigger picture.

The Genesis of this was around anger at the banks destroying our money.  Having it be a valuable and censorship resistant store of value is first priority.  It is spendible, and will become more so over time but that is actually less important than it's immutability and decentralized features.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:04:08
I see transactions go by transferring 100's of thousands of dollars with 4 dollar fees.  Try to do that with gold...  and verify it all... and get it physically moved...  and store it... and in around an hour!
Let tier 2 solutions have cheap fees.  The base layer is unbeatable for big money, and that's why the fees are worth it. Still confused?

I really don't understand where you are coming from.  Have you ever mined?
The goal is decentralized mining with pure competition.  Needs a level playing field.  Patents don't fit into that, neither do covert advantages. 
On segwit, how can you view miners holding the protocol back as  good thing. Miners are supposed to be greedy etc... but their job is to secure the blocks, not define the protocol.  Segwit could/should have been activated 6 months earlier..  Would have had more adoption, by now providing  emptier blocks and given the devs more time to work on other stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:51:34
Bugs me too.. but it's on us- we failed to win the meme war.  
Everyone can understand big blocks means more throughput.  Fewer can understand that 8M vs 1M is a drop in the bucket compared to what is really needed AND has a centralization cost. We should have meme'd it up more.  
We also should have DEMANDED all the biggest transaction generators switch to segwit so that we could drop the mem pool down.  It's been so freaking high through all of this it plays into the easy to understand arguments.

Hi! Your question is, frankly, mistakenly focused on RBF.  Bitcoin Cash has all of the same limitations Bitcoin does in this regard.  The entire premise of Bitcoin originally is trying to solve the real problem you're concerned about: double-spending. Double spending is the reason why proof-of-work was invented.  To rephrase- the question is framed as a 'RBF' issue, but it is actully a 0-conf issue that is true whether it is  RBF or non-RBF.
On RBF: RBF is meant to allow people who have too small of a fee to pay a larger one to get it to go through faster.  RBF is an opt-in flag created in the spend. As a merchant, you can make a point of never accepting any spend that is flagged for RBF, but it **will not save you if you are accepting things with no confirmations.**
**0-conf's are never safe!**  As a merchant, the problem 0-conf is that anyone can double spend attack you period. Here is a site that shows doublespend attacks on Bitcoin cash:[ you look you will find some that succeed.  Exactly the same issue on Bitcoin, this  is why everyone responding here is saying to wait for a confirmation in a block.
Lightning is a great solution, receipt is near instant and guaranteed valid.  Other solutions proposed on various coins involve consensus or trust of some kind- that only shifts how to game the system from double spending with higher fee to something else, doesn't really solve the problem.
On accepting 0-confs:  I think the only businesses that should risk using them are ones where the total value transferred is small enough that the potential losses due to double spend are tolerable.  I'm guessing a business may expect less than 1% of customers to do this attack today, I don't know if that rate will go up in the future

You guys don't get it.  What did you learn from Brexit?  From the Trump win?
Simple rhetoric and ideas like 'corporate interests' and 'too complex' and 'the economics matter more than the technicals' are memes everyone can understand.  If repeated enough people believe them.  The BU folks have won enough people over with these things that they have created a significant base of supporters AND they have successfully made them angry at 'core'.  They are polluting lots of /bitcoin threads now.
What has been done to promote segwit?  We say trust the devs... We say LN LN LN.  It's not simple enough to understand.   It's not easy enough to sell. For example it took months to even get people to realize that segwit had a blocksize increase- during which time time it was used against SW...  Even now BU supporters say 'SW is not a scaling solution'... but we know it is.  I'm not in marketing-  I wish we had some meme makers who understood this well enough to boil it down and market it to the masses to refute all the BU BS.

@_date: 2018-03-11 18:16:41
Again im trying to restate things I saw in a video...  Nodes can implement all kinds of balancing policies.  If their path is unavailable for whatever the routing algo should find a different one, wether that is a many to one or one to one.  We shouldn't be linked to just one node in the first place or else we could have problems if they don't want to relay for us.  What do you mean by collecting data?
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:42:45
I read once that overt if done the way this one is done doesn't incentivise mining empty blocks the way the cevert one was implemented.  That's why I'm ok with overt in this case, it only touches fields that are compatible with full blocks.
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:45:19
That could totally happen (sign ups required to open channels).  Thing is, this is all open source, so thousands of every day people can start a node any time they want and route stuff right around them.  The community can source far more lightning nodes than any one (business) can.

At this point we are talking past each other.  I said they don't have to calculate as much, which is what you said also.  
I think my point stands- the easier calculations mean difficulty inflation rather than benefit.  It's securing the network in a way that is less meaningful and would wash out if it didn't exist in the first place.
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:28:54

I haven't seen anyone talk about generic empty block fixes though.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:07:01
It is false work- a partial proof instead of a the full pow.  It makes the chain longer sure, but it wasn't allowed the difficulty would still scale...  We would still have 1 block on every 10 minutes on average.  Only difference is we wouldn't be wasting empty block propagation time, miner costs, storage, power costs etc...  The benefit is an illusion.  No?

@_date: 2017-05-31 20:01:36
I disagree they secure the chain, it's more of an illusion. 
Miners should only race to find a true solve with transactions rather than waste effort racing only find they have been beaten by an empty one that used asicboost. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:28:31
I must be missing something here.  Propagation time doesn't help the miner?
Miners who mine an empty block with ASICBoost get faster/easier because they don't have to calculate as much.  That leads to a higher effective network difficulty with no real benefit except to them right?

Agreed.  Empty blocks may not even be the worst part.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:32:07
I could be confused, but I do understand that empty blocks make the chain longer.  Here are my assumptions (any could be wrong, thanks in advance for any education provided):
1.  Empty blocks are easier to make.
2.  Empty blocks have less value to the network than blocks with transactions.
3.  Because of  then we have difficulty inflation.
4.  ASICBoost creates (some of the?) empty blocks.
Conclusion  Because of    and  it would be better to disallow ASICBoost. Difficulty will go back down to maintain the same level of security of the blockchain due to  (so no net loss). Meanwhile the average usefulness of all blocks will go up which is better for everyone.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:44:22
The header takes space no matter what, isn't 2 blocks with the same number of transactions less efficient than 1?
I guess increasing the utilization (larger average block size) is what I am after.  I don't see the downside yet.  We want more capacity right now not less.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:47:31
I assume you can see my other post to stale2000. 
Does this mean my assumption  is wrong?
If it is not easier/faster etc... why would anyone mine empty blocks?  
I think not verifying the integrity is one form of "easier" which would lead to difficulty inflation.

In case there is confusion I meant the Xilinx Zynq 7010 is not very big.  I need to think about what it takes to implement the logic in terms of LUT/Flop counts.  Vcorem might be right that they don't have the right hardware to execute the advantage.
I agree in a low margin business any advantage will have a multiplier on the benefit.
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:26:02
Good point. I don't see a way around that. Doesn't change the miner advantage point of the discussion but I think you are right.  
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:49:06
Right now, the biggest use is speculation.I'm okay with speculation being the way that we get enough liquidity to be stable.Another way to get liquidity is by getting people to 'save' in it, as in store of value, as they do a bank account.  This has more impact on price than adoption actually.
Once stable more people will want to use it generally, as you would like to.
The next problem is scaling, storage has value, and it is expensive to store all transactions forever in a block chain.  Lightning is going to be amazing at keeping small stuff that doesn't need to be on chain off our hard drives.
When we get through these phases we can truly be our own banks.  Who knows how long it will take.  Our growth currently is not that fast compared to other tech revolutions, but I'm still optimistic and I'm usually a pessimist in most matters.
