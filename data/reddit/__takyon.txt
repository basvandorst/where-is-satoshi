Wouldn't 100 satoshis be $0.015 today?

Yes, and "if everyone" doesen't work in markets, so it's a pointless statement of something that can't ever happen.

Maybe I should have worded it differently. What I meant was that blocks becomes entirely filled by people willing to pay slightly more. The point is that you can't have a collusion involving a large number of individual people in markets like these, because there is an incentive to violate that collusion. As OP (of this comment branch) said, greed won't allow it.

Yes, but that's as naive as saying: "if no one ever sold, the price would have to increase". Transactions in bitcoin is a market, and markets can't be manipulated like that. If people started to pay lower fees, a few people would happily pay slightly more to get on the blockchain faster. Then all those people paying lower fees would have to match up, or else their tx's will never get on the blockchain. This will repeat until we're back at the current fees.

Hah, I think so! o/

Not to defend the product since it's a bad idea economically, but it's passively cooled by the metal radiator and doesen't have any fans. I would say that sound-level is a pretty important aspect of space heaters, so saying that an ASIC is better for space heating in your home is a little dishonest.
I would maybe consider this product if I had more money than I could spend, just for the sci-fi-ness of it. I don't think anyone would actually buy it for economical reasons.

This is true and it's the reason why I say it's bad from an economical perspective. Even buying a cost-efficient mining rig today is a big risk, and buying this product doubles that risk.
Bitcoin is often used interchangeably with crypto by media, I guess because it gets more clicks. 
I think that people buying this realize that it's just a cool gimmick, but you never know. I think that it has a nice design and it's kind of equivalent to buying a IoT fridge/oven with a LED display or whatever, completely pointless and expensive but acts more like futuristic interior design than something functional.

Well the product is supposed to be both, so it's not really comparable.
Also, this thing is not supposed to mine bitcoin. Two RX 580 earns $3.41/day mining altcoins, while a 5gh/s SHA-256 ASIC earns $0.004/day mining bitcoin (electricity cost not included in either). This thing is thus better from an economical perspective, unless you were thinking about another algorithm. 
Again, not defending the product.
