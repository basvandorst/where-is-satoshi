This might be really risky but the ActiveMining CEO just put up some shares up for sale at 0.0005/share to recoup some lost funds from a shareholder and the shares have a guaranteed 0.0025 BTC/share dividend so they seem cheap to me, even though the guarantee means nothing. I bought some. The all-time high was 0.0075/share so you are looking at a large upside if everything goes well. Again, RISKY, but some diversification wouldn't hurt! 
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:33:31
All they really need to do is set up an email with Coinbase.com, press Request Money, press Request Money, copy the generated Bitcoin address, open up a BlockChain.info tab, enter the Bitcoin address into the search bar, bookmark that BlockChain.info page. Then print out the QR Code and post it somewhere visible and readable. Now whenever someone wants to pay in Bitcoin all they have to is go to the bookmarked site to check if they send funds to the address. Internet connection is required.

Create an offline BIP 0038 Paper Wallet, write down the password and keep it somewhere extremely SAFE, maybe two places, print the wallet 5 times, put it in different places without the password.

From the Bitcoin Wiki under Transactions: An output contains instructions for sending bitcoins. Value is the number of Satoshi (1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshi) that this output will be worth when claimed.

"Some people think that Bitcoin will never become a useful currency but rather a better version of gold or a replacement to gold entirely (Gold 2.0). If this is all Bitcoin becomes, a good question is: “What would that make each Bitcoin worth?” Well, the value of all of the gold in the world is roughly $8 trillion. Assuming that Bitcoin can replace gold as a more useful store of value, then the upper bound of each Bitcoin would be almost $400,000 ($8 trillion/21 million bitcoins)." - Chamath Palihapitiya

If you only have one satoshi, then you can only do one output on the blockchain and you're done, you don't have the ability to use the blockchain unless you get more, at a cost.

They hoped to accomplish this end by informing the poor of their rights to welfare assistance, encouraging them to apply for benefits and, in effect, overloading an already overburdened bureaucracy."

If you really want to mess with peoples mind you should cover Colored Coins instead of alt coins which is very interesting. Go here for more information: [ but basically the developers of the colored coins client, renamed ChromaWallet, make it possible to "color" the Bitcoin that come from a certain address.
 So lets say I am a company and I want to offer shares in an IPO, I can take 0.1 Bitcoin which equal 10 million satoshi (1 Bitcoin = 100 million satoshi), send them to an address which the company designates as the "genesis" address and then "color" them so that when viewed through a Colored Coins client, each satoshi represents one share of the IPO. I consider it as "Bitcoin 2.0" since it has the ability to utilize the massive Bitcoin infrustructure to create Bitcoins second major app, the first being a currency and the second being a completely decentralized Stock Exchange.

Why does the volatility of the market make companies wary if they are going to convert to fiat immediately anyways? What companies should be into is the disconnect from all the fees that are eating away from their profits when they use credit cards to process transactions, BitPay makes it alot cheaper for them.

Anyone have a stylish way to add a screen to this so I can sell wallets locally like at a school campus or something?

What I'm trying to say is that I think the Bitcoin that the people on that list currently own are going to be used once the price keeps creeping up. There will obviously be some billionaires who hold their coins till a million but this is the second time I heard someone say that people in here think they are going to be billionaires just by buying a few coins.

Nevermind its not :( is there a physical book out on bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:21:07
It is NOT a genuine security concern, that is what everyone in here is trying to tell you. Just like you dying in the next five seconds isn't a genuine concern to you because the odds are so astronomically low.

Thanks! Your example is just enough to get me learning enough to intergrate it into my site.

How many people with more than 1000 Bitcoin do you think are holding till $1,000,000 a Bitcoin?

Bluebird is brought to you by American Express and Walmart. No thanks.

Isn't it RISK FREE for businesses to accept Bitcoin as payment through BitPay and Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:28:29
No those are valid reasons, as I have seen both happen. I've seen Mt.Gox lag to hell and have some effect on the crash this year (not really Bitcoin itself but the infrastructure still needs work scaling up). Also there as been forks before if I remember correctly. I think with the startups joining into Bitcoin that the scaling issue is solvable but I'm not too familiar on how forks happen to the blockchain and the process that goes into fixing them.

I used Mycelium which has an option for scanning a private key and from there you can send it anywhere.

Not really likely but what if they have to give the coins back to DPR?

Anyone know if they have an affiliate program? Would be nice to explain bitcoin to merchants and having them sign up for free, then when bitcoin goes to the moon you have a nice customer set that can upgrade to an appropriate pricing and make money from it. Sort of like investing my time for future benefit, like a startup?

How hard is it to get money into BTC-E? I see their price is about $12 dollars less than bitfloor. I should be doing a large purchase soon and am wondering if its worth it to try out BTC-E.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:38:52
BitCoin feels like a startup where everyone that has a bitcoin is involved. Its up to us to make BitCoin part of the future, it won't happen by itself.

I'm thinking.. is there a way to send Bitcoin directly to people in third world countries yet? Save the Children commercials with the kids holding up QR codes?
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:55:32
I'm saying if you sell them BTC which you then handle, I think you can only exchange up to $1000 per person per day into BTC for them unless you are a registered money transmitter.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:16:25
This is really cool. What would be amazing for store owners would be something like this that connects to the internet and can verify that a payment is confirmed. I know the phone can be used but something that is only for bitcoin payment verification would be cool to sell.

Why do people keep saying it will produce billionaires? Someone would have to invest $300,000 ($300 x 1000 Bitcoin) and wait for them to get to $1,000,000 a Bitcoin to be a billionaire. How many people on r/bitcoin do you think are putting in $300,000 into Bitcoin? You would have to be well off already.

SHHH! I think they are just trying to get on the good side of regulators who think that people still care about what the government tells them they can or cannot do.. You can't download free music, oh ok. You can't use "those" bitcoins, oh ok.

I think it's because Bitcoin as money coincides with his ideologies but for some reason he doesn't "get it". I'm rooting that one day he does get it and I think most people on here are too.

There probably will be, I'd start learning about Colored Coins because I think that is where a lot of value can be created.

I'm on r/bitcoin pretty often and never have seen this and the moment I am looking to integrate a ticker on my site I see this :) I love synchronicity! I want to use the coinbase API instead, can I just replace the url? Any sites you can point me to so I can learn how to integrate this:  to my site?
