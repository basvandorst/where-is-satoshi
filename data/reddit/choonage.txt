If we are going to 8k lets go already! Feelin' like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day!

For real, day of the crash last week, coindesk article is like BTC heading to 15K ! (crashes to 10K instead). Today article on coindesk is like BTC heading to 8K ! (goes to 11K). Basically even the industry "professionals" have no idea what it's going to do. And lets not get started on what the guys drawing triangles and making predictions based on line graphs are saying. They are pretty much all wrong all the time.  This is not the stock market, this is uncharted waters. No one knows what's next.

based on what? youtubers and commenters on this thread, spreading fud and overreacting? Truth is, no one knows. We wait and see.

Because a crazy guy who makes virus software said he would eat his johnson if it didn't go to said price. Oh and so did those twins who say they created facebook, they also said it will reach a high value.

@_date: 2018-03-15 00:59:16
sounds like a great plan
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:47:50
Only seems to go up when someone is manipulating the market to make it look like the market cap is rising, creating FOMO. Then they dump when everyone finally buys in. Not spreading FUD just calling it how I see it.

ha ha ha...All your bulls are belong to us!

Some words to live by my G
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:28:36
Those guys better be careful playing market "God" because we are on a slippery slope to crashville. I'm sure they have way more to loose then the average retail person, so I hope they are having fun with their manipulation and mind games. It shall cost them big in the end. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:05:16
They need to STOP! Everyone just hodl!

Should boop the nose and maybe the bears will stop.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:45:45
This is true. WE hard working Joe's are not buying. Bought a vacation package for two nights at the beach, and even tho it was expensive, It was so much more gratifying then thinking of how I could have lost all the money back in Feb. Still hodling some but not nearly as much as I had before. If you watch carefully the market cap has pretty much flat lined.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:37:06
Whole market is down and just so happens that his shit coin is up 25% on the day of the big interview. What a joke. He was acting like it's always doing that well every day. Shame on you Roger. Sad.

For real, it's getting all infowars up in this bitch

"bitscoin" seems legit as well

For all the people running around screaming HODL, sure seems (based on market action) like no one really understands what that means. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:59:37
it so pathetic, look at that dead cat bounce.

Yesterday he said it was most likely on its way back up to 10K, lol. Gotta love coindesk! Always good for a laugh.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:31:19
Don't celebrate yet, when I got up 3 hrs ago it was 10200 now its 10297. This bear market is pure shit.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:38:35
Something funny going on with that. On Gdax it goes from being 900 to 1200. 2% to 26%+. I have also seen BTC keep flashing the number 7745 and then go back to the 8000s. Coinbase with the funny buisness again?
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:40:46
this is why we can't have nice things

Print 100 million tether when he goes to sleep, then pump it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:23:42
Seems like there is a ton of trading bots that love bringing the price down. They sell increments of .001 all day long. Seen it happen a lot the last few weeks.

I think he is correct about the no more lemmings coming in for another FOMO rush. It already happened back in December. Who is left? Everyone and their grandmother is already in. Who else is going to create the mass hysteria/mass adoption? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:59:29
I wasn't asking a question. I was merely stating the obvious. Going to be a long time until there is a surplus of FOMO and shortage of sellers.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:06:52
No wonder why no one wants to invest in Bitcoin, that shit dick has spread so much negativity and tried to confuse everyone with BCH. Also BCH release on coinbase in December was Shady AF. Hope BCH is being ripped apart from the insides and dies a slow death.  
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:49:52
Should be the green as long as some asswipe doesn't sell his entire change jar at the bottom again. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:32:32
Yes. I was happy to finally hear people talking about the un\-pairing of bitcoin to other coins. Alt market was hitting ATH's and then Bitcoin took them all down to the bottom with it. The last few months every chart just looked like btc chart. Whats the point?

Bears. Polish Sausage. Ditka.

lol. dude the bulls are fucking dead unfortunately. please don't fall for this shit again. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:00:15
Yes, there is a lot of money on the sidelines that would not invest into an asset that cannot go one day without a major sell off and loses value by the minute. Oh and it is also manipulated by who the fuck knows?
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:36:07
when print tethers?
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:04:34
Prob just wait a few days. The price has gone only down for the last 3 months. This is the first two consecutive green days in a long time.
