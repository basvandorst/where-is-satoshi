You could simply post a craigslist ad, meet up with a local bitcoin user and just swap cash for BTC! Your only fees in this case would be the TX fees.

The lightning network is soon to be OFFICIATED , that will allow us to up the transaction speeds while lowering the fees, to sum it up simply I believe.

+1 on this, I bought a Nano Ledger S , couldn't be happier with security, usability, and availability... just like Bitcoin itself ;)

This guys such trash, any educated person would have unfollowed him after a day of reading his tweets.

Hey How much is that surgery going to cost in BTC value? Never choose money over BTC. Good idea.

If tether collapses , isn’t that good for bitcoin... and all other crypto’s?

That second website looks like my grandma made it, is this your way of getting people to sell btc to whatever scam website that second one is ?

Wow, that is the most worth 2 BTC I've ever seen spent.

I lost 920 ETH on the myetherwallet hack that occured due to HOLA extension about 3 months ago, I hope if its any of those scammers this BTC stays blocked.
Honestly... It hurt losing that much, I had just moved 920ETH 2 days prior from ledger to a MEW wallet just because I was going to sell it IRL.
If this is the case and he was a part of that or any other scam or hack, PLEASE BLOCK HIS ACCOUNT.
