Ethereum seems like it will spike when the crash occurs

I found my address, now I have to search the bip 39 private keys that match up to my address?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:31:26
I mean I found the addresses I used that contain the bit coin cash using the search bar. I also have my mnemonic, but how do I generate the private key to match these specific addresses?
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:52:38

@_date: 2017-10-26 03:11:41
Well I figured it out for the most part but now apparently my old address doesn't have bcc in it even though I know I had btc at the time lol I still have a hang of it now and will try again tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:50:48
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:33:49
So how would I get the coins on a hardware wallet? I have btc on one 
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:44:18
I was looking into this, is this an app for phones or an actual desktop computer

@_date: 2017-10-26 15:41:43
By searching my wallet addresses from around then?
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:03:53
