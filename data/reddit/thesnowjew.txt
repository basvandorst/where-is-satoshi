Why won't it become a global currency? There is a huge network effect at play here: the more businesses and people who accept bitcoin, the easier it becomes to switch to bitcoin-only for your business and personal life.
At a fundamental level, it's better than all fiat currencies (more secure, not inflationary, can't be seized, hard to tax, cheaper to transfer, etc). It's still at an early state and many more secondary services need to be developed (Coinbase, Trezor, etc) so that even your grandma can use it. 
Today for bitcoin is like the early 90s for the internet. Only a few nerds are playing around with it and few expect it to encompass all of society. But look at the internet today: even my 90 year old grandpa has an iPad with Sykpe.

Dude, the whole world isn't a crypt-currency; what are you even talking about comparing Standard Oil to Ghash?
And I still don't understand your criticisms of Rockefeller. He consolidated a large portion of a young, volatile, and inefficient industry into an efficient corporation and in the process reduced consumer prices by over 70%. What part of this was detrimental to society, other than not fitting into some economist's model of that a "perfectly competitive market" *should* look like?

But the price was going down for the most part during Rockefeller's "monopoly." Consumers we getting more kerosene at cheaper prices, so I don't see how this could be considered a negative impact on most of society.

No everyone who owns bitcoin has a blockchain.info account. There are lots of other clients and web wallets. It's tricky to estimate, see some further discussion [here]( and [here](
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:14:04
At least [1.2 million users on blockchain.info]( that's a good place to start an estimate.

I'm not sure that's 100% true. According to [bitcoinfees.com](

Is an offline computer overkill? In the past I've generated my wallets with my standard online Windows desktop with private browsing mode enabled; when I'm done printing I restart the PC.
I send 0.01 BTC to the address and let it sit for two weeks. If no one has stolen it by then, my private keys must be secure right? If my computer was infected and the private keys compromised, wouldn't that vulnerability be exploited very shortly after the address had a balance?

I agree, unexpected deflation is bad. It puts creditors at risk of being unable to pay back their debts. Low, expected deflation (this would result after bitcoin stabilized as the world's currency) is good for most people. If you know what the deflation rate is going to be, then you can calculate that into your loan rates so you don't end up in debt.
Inflation, even expected inflation, erodes the savings and wages of the poor and middle class. The rich are mostly exempt... they can pay Wall St investors to keep their rate of return higher than inflation. More info on the [benefits of deflation here](
It's "better" in terms of taxes avoidance because almost everyone doesn't like paying taxes, thus they would rather be paid in bitcoin vs fiat. I'm not saying taxes will go away completely; there are still many things for government to tax (property, tariffs, etc).

How is the price of bitcoin unlikely to crash if a single pool controls over 51% of the hashing power and is actively working to undermine the decentralized philosophy behind the protocol (by by orphaning all other blocks)?
At that point the value of bitcoin is essentially zero. It's no longer a distributed ledger system, all transactions are potentially subject to double-spending, and it might as well be renamed "FederalReserveCoin" with Janet Yellen in charge.

Great thoughts, and I don't think you've even considered some of the larger implications of bitcoin:
* For bitcoin to become the world's currency, it will need to rise substantially in value. World M2 money supply is about $60 trillion dollars. Implying a price of over $3 million per BTC.
* This transition to bitcoin as the world's currency (and subsequent rise in price) will result in a massive redistribution of wealth, from holders of fiat (and holders of fiat debt) to holders of bitcoin (mostly early adopters like us)
* The political implications from this economic shift cannot be underestimated. Bitcoin allows politicians to be bought off much more discreetly and the "new money" bitcoin holders will likely have very different political interests compared to the present political elite.

Well I'm assuming you have more than one BTC, a relatively cheap venture for most American bitcoiners these days (and trivial had you been buying last year or earlier).
Also this is only US money supply. [World money supply is about $60T]( which [puts us way past millionaire status](
The numbers get even better if you figure that in 10 years, there will still be only [19.7 million coins]( and that [at least 2 million coins have been lost during the early days]( = [$3.39 million](

If there was no fee, the network would get spammed with tiny transactions and it would interrupt legitimate use of Bitcoin. Transactions fees make DoS attacks expensive.

A one time double-spend attack. Then miners start fleeing ghash because it's undermining the value of bitcoin and the attack ends. That's a really expensive and complicated way to perform a double spend.

Investments usually represent a claim on a business's physical assets. Ex: If you own shares in BP, you own part of an oil tanker. These capital goods will  still have value and revenue generating abilities, regardless of a financial crisis.

* For daily use: Coinbase
* For savings: M of N paper wallet generated offline. Put at least two of the pieces in two different safe deposit boxes. Hide the other pieces someplace secure (your house, workplace, parent's house etc).
