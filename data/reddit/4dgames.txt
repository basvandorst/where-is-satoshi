lol proof plz
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:05:02
No, they are the Goldman of crypto, making money through manipulation of customer funds
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:08:03
use XAPO or bitfinex

Switzerland buddy, in the ass crack of a mountain
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:44:52
Of course, and they take advantage of the fact
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:16:58
yeah while xapo did it a month ago, and kraken enabled it a week before the fork. read between the lines my friend
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:36:44
government intervention in manipulation of asset prices is like having a policeman. Do you like having the police keep the bad men from murdering you? Same thing but with our wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:35:15
That would be extremely illegal bro, I hope the SEC looks into him
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:47:47
wish it worked like that man
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:45:04
agreed, xapo is also good
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:45:03
yeah this is financial warfare. buying and selling for political gain and ideological reasons. so yes the enemy lol.
hmm if you say so, but that's besides the point. they sold Saturday evening when most people are busy. it was an attack, and we could do nothing but watch with our hands tied.
so pass out the arrows, bitches
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:51:30
me too man
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:52:37
Just how stupid does he think we are. 
Dont answer that, you fuck.
We will not forget.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:45:26
this is the most fucked up retarded shit ive read all day
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:37:03
Fuck em indeed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:44:37
That isn't how it works. There are attackers and defenders. They attack or threaten to attack and we defend. So you tell me who the good guys are, the guys with the schemes and the rhetoric or the guys who don't talk and offer nothing but code.

Lol Jihan Wu is also not Roger Ver. Your statement is invalid, so stfu
Just because he's working behind the scenes doesn't mean he's irrelevant. 
Open your fucking eyes
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:13:24
you're insinuating that I should hold my own keys? Why yes i do, so fuck off coinbase shill
the balance I had in coinbase at the time of the fork was not all of my holdings. The fork was at an inopportune time during the summer so could not move fast enough. As custodians of those funds they have a responsibility to ensure we receive what is ours.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:35:42
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:32:45
sure buddy
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:45:46
true, but wences is a good man and he only means the best. He was one of the first to admit he was wrong and that he was too impatient
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:53:37
lol nice sockpuppets they have. 
yes it was an attack, and I admire their move. Well played. I just wanna throw a punch bro.
coinbase plz? brian? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:49:04
no I saw that, you call that a pump?
I guess it's all relative
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:46:15
Yeah, try XAPO who is quick and professional with forks
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:38:44
Same villain, the bitcoin judas Ver, for years now. 
Power corrupts absolutely.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:20:02
Yeah, I'd recommend everyone move to XAPO
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:54:56
Add brian armstrong and coinbase to this mix
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:48:40
LOL what else is new
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:38:10
exactly, but the truth comes out in the end. He's not even bothering to hide his glee after the cash pump, check out his twitter he's congratulating Ver
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:45:34
not a healthy way to think man, why do you care?
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:39:21
holy shit that's it? In all of France? 1.2k bitcoiners?
