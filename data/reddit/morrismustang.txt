He mentioned there was a deal struck between MGT and Bitmain when he spoke at TNABC. He briefly mentioned a timeline which would indicate to me that Bitmain is producing for their farm right now.

Someone needs to produce the asic chips and allow them to be purchased as a component. These chips need to be made available rather than just as an assembled unit. This will trigger real development in the hardware space of bitcoin.

Can't wait to talk with the group about this one tomorrow. Keep them coming! I initially envisioned some sort of dystopian MARIO scene where Mario is dragging Yoshi tied to a cart through a pixelated Super MARIO Brothers 1 Workd 1-2 type cave and breaking chained blocks to pop out different cryptocoins. Sa-Toad-shi came into it somehow...

Not debating my reasoning on that. Personal preference based on my goals. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:59:27
Changing off of ASICs when so many of the large players have invested tons of money into research, engineering and hardware would be catastrophic. Also, ASICs are more power efficient. Going backwards would be a mistake on all fronts. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 13:23:59
Antminer R4 is made for that purpose. Efficient ASIC miner with no fan so it's silent! Haven't used one but it's a less powerful version of the Antminer S9.

I don't care about their pricing. What matters is that they offer wire for same day service or ACH for a week delay. I paid extra on both sides (Coinbase takes a fee for wires) to get money there same day...and they received the funds into their account without crediting or even marking my account as pending.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:49:43
Transaction not listed in my dashboard as it is a wire and not an ACH...have you ever done this before? 
A wire is initiated on my banks side and I self report to Coinbase that they should expect to receive it. Completely different process than the standard ACH into your Coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:40:39
Monday. And I had friends along side me send wires at the same time, and again on Wednesday--and both got recognized in their respective accounts. I've reached out through support tickets with the IMAD wire number and no responses. And I don't even believe they use their twitter customer service anymore.

This will definitely be included in the mural just for you 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:48:24
When you go through your USD wallet and make a wire deposit, it gives you wire instructions and says 2 days max. 
"Wire deposits will typically arrive within 1 business day. Wire deposits can take up to 2 days depending on your service provider."

Unclear. Still doesn't explain how he can make such a claim. Impossible to know that metric, especially since his name is no where to be found on the hashrate distribution charts.

I'm assuming we are going to need to pay for it. But I wanted to source some ideas for the mural first so I can justify it to my team.

FedWire. Paid extra money to make sure it got there same day. 
Have the FedWire tracking info and both banks confirmed the transaction.

The bulk of our revenue is from our own mining machines. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:10:39
I don't need to take them down. Just want my money to appear either on Coinbase or back in my bank account. Im satisfied with either outcome.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:42:06
I'm relying on Bitmains ability to brick them should they get stolen...that was the intention right 
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:17:48
Not quite China rates but within range to make it feasible. We are working closely with the monopolistic electric company to squander as many resources as possible, efficiently. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 00:13:03
Mining can't be a level playing field anymore without drastic changes to the paradigm. The companies who make the ASICs do not price the chips according to the cost of manufacturing, they price then based on expected yield, thereby removing most of the profit possible. Those same companies are also building miners for themselves, which operate at an extreme profit, because their costs to activate each machine are substantially lower. All of the NRE costs for development are paid by the smaller miners who are desperate to get their hands on the equipment, even at a premium. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:00:52
It does not list expected time of transaction as it is a wire...
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:02:43
Yes our business operates for profit. I know it's not trendy. I'm okay with it.

I like how you use term most likely to hedge your statements. Look it up before you quote it.

Go into your Coinbase account, click the button for deposit on your USD wallet, switch to the wire tab (if you are approved for wire) and follow the instructions. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:43:18
Maximum two days but if the wire comes in first thing in the morning, it should be in the account by 1pm

@_date: 2017-04-06 13:09:12
Now they are caught up in ASICBoost scandal and today they reactivated the ability to purchase miners with USD, which you couldn't do for the past 4 months. Why now? 
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:59:44
As a hardware guy myself, I would tend to agree 
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:18:15
Not sure how everyone is glossing over this. Pimento Loaf is much more concerning as an attack than ASICBoost. I bet the shills will try to cover this up.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:42:44
Is this related to litecoin or bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-26 00:43:02
Not saying it's novel. I know it's not new tech. I'm questioning its existence.

McAfee at it again with his porn site virus that steals your bitcoin story. Is he releasing a hardware wallet? He is pumping hardware wallet technology globally at every conference but has yet to release a device...Is Trezor, Ledger, or Keepkey paying for this hype?
@_date: 2017-04-26 01:08:27
Right. My question still stands...has anyone seen one in person. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 00:20:38
Bitmain makes the fastest miner available. Mining with anything else is pointless. Purchasing miners from Bitmain is supporting them too but guess what, its reliable. Say what you want about the software side of the things, but from a hardware perspective, Bitmain is the only player in town.
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:22:42
Rumors of a new product? Can you provide a link to these rumors? New chip? 
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:24:46
When I spoke with reps at their booth at TNABC'17, they assured me they are part of Bitmain (from China). Always seemed sketchy though.
@_date: 2017-04-26 10:40:38
Getting pictures would most likely be impossible based on NDAs people keep referencing in order to speak with Bitfury. Still though, no one can confirm they have even seen mining equipment produced by Bitfury. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 01:16:25
Unless that NDA is on the blockchain, it never happened 
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:35:51
Miner production...and therefore hashrate growth 
@_date: 2017-04-05 00:22:12
It would be exceptionally hypocritical to say buying a Bitmain antminer is acceptable but plugging it back into Antpool or ConnectBTC or any other pool they operate is not.
@_date: 2017-04-04 11:45:44
Sounds like fun. How many miners do you want to set up? Looks like you have good conditions to make mining profitable. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 04:30:40
So what this looks like is that everyone buying miners has been paying more than double what the insiders have been paying. To have had machines running in September, he would have purchased the machines at the beginning of August 2016 presumably. Bitmain used to give discounts on bulk purchases, 50+ miners being the second tier and it warranted a 5% discount. Whats the deal with this?
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:21:16
No one said anything about a good value...I still don't understand the T9. Less of the same chips, cheaper, similar hash rate to S9. Someone mentioned they overclocked the chips...sounds to me like they have a shorter life span.
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:58:17
I thought (and still think) they are separate companies. Just very deceptive.
@_date: 2017-04-17 23:32:16
First round of the Litecoin miners shipped last Friday. Second batch goes out May 5. Usually 5-6 day shipping from China. Smart folks already have an outlet and power supply waiting. Wait till later this week to see what happens.

I'd like to know more about how the ASIC was reverse engineered. Seems easier said than done. Can GMax reverse engineer other ASICs? This could be extremely valuable beyond the scope of bitcoin.
