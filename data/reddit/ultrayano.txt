The thing is... if you hf Ethereum it basically happens nothing.  
Maybe the market price per Ether decreases but Ethereum keeps its function.  
  
Ether isn't a value holder. It is a supply to build things (ex. dApps, ENS). The market is the one who makes Ether so valuable. The better the technology the higher the price because if it will be the Web3 then you need Ether as a supply.  
  
Bitcoin on the other hand hasn't a function other than being a currency and so a value holder. A Bitcoin hard fork will split the market with the consequence of making the orig. Bitcoin BC not longer valuable because no one wants to use an outdated software.  
  
ETC isn't worth as much as ETH because it hasn't the functions of ETH. There isn't such a thing as a Ethereum Classic Alliance or incoming ENS/Raider.  
  
Vitalik doesn't want to destroy Bitcoin. He doesn't even see Bitcoin as a rival.

If you want to have a value holder other than fiat =&gt; no.  
If you want to make more money =&gt; yes.  
  
Still no reason to fight over the technologies. The idea of Bitcoin is not to make tons of money. The idea is to have a digital decentralized currency and to transfer money with about no fees and high speed.  
  
You use Amazon but you can't make tons of money with it, because that wasn't the idea behind it.  
  
TL;DR: It's too late to make money when they have reached maturity, but not to use them how it is intended to be used.

It's not about making profit. It's about having a value holder other than fiat.  
  
Crypto will be worth nothing at this state when the unlikely scenario in which the global communication network is interrupted arrives. (WW, Sun Eruption, etc).  
Gold however has a solid value in such a situation.  
  
Again... the idea of Crypto isn't to make profit and I'm also invested in Crypto but fighting over different blockchains makes no sense when we're at the beginning of a future technology.  
  
Same with Apple and Microsoft in the past. Both survived.

What's going on with all the people hating each other....   
  
In fact, Ethereum and Bitcoin both had a rollback. Bitcoin in 2010 and Ethereum @ the DAO.  
  
And both technologies aren't even good enough to say which one will survive.  
Bitcoin is worth nothing at the bad state it has at the moment. It's the same with Ethereum.  
  
Blockchain technology just started to get popular.  
Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are in a bubble at the moment. If you wanna go the safe path then buy gold but definitly not a virtual currency which isn't even mature enough to say if it will survive.  
  
If Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin then both aren't even nearly big enough to say which Blockchain will survive in the future.  
  
No blockchain is too big to fail at the moment!  
  
Edit: Bitcoin and Ethereum are different technologies... you can't compare gold with an excel sheet.

You don't understand my point, don't you?

Yes, I'm not a big fan either but metals don't depend on a peer to peer network, so it's definitly a plus.

Because of the rollback?
