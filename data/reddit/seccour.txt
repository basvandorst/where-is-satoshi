You can use your Ledger with Mycelium on your phone too and it can support passphrase protected account too. And since it's cheaper, it a better option than Trezor.

It's not really a feature. It's like instead of closing and then reopening a channel. You just send BTC to someone (or a company or whatever) that have a channel open with enough liquidity that can send you BTC over LN through your existing open channel.
So instead of doing 2 transactions to 'refund' your channel, you're only doing one so you're saving on fees.

There is no need for another coin if you can just use Bitcoin to do the same thing.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:06:47
So first, for what they want to do they don't need to make that much transactions so transaction cost isn't a problem. And second, creating their own coin (and maintaining it) will cost them way a shitload of money.

When they stop contributing ? :D
I guess the graph represent the number of unique contributors per months, so the number of individual account that did do a PR (merged or not, or just the merged ones - depending on ). So the number of unique developers that are still active might be more than the recent pics.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:32:48

Let's get it straight, if your local pizza shop accept Bitcoin they probably use something like Bitpay. And even if they use Bitcoin directly, there is already LN user-friendly wallets: 
And here your example is bad because a local pizza shop has nothing to do to be prepared for LN compared to services like exchanges, payment-processors, etc...
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:01:02
So what ? It's not because they did chose to keep their Bitcoin on the exchange that we should be proud that the exchange did sell their BCH.
It's a bad practice and we should not promote it. (EDIT: Both keeping your coins on exchange, and exchange selling the fork-coin instead of distributing them)
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:55:27
I did have no money on Bitmex at the time lf the fork so i didn't miss any thing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:26:34
Because Bitcoin wasn't used that much. You can't keep Bitcoin **censorship resistant** and decentralized right now with bigger blocks.
We will have to use layer 2 or 3.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:21:56
No it should not. If Ledger is not completely open source it's because they use a security chip which make the device more secure than a Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:12:17
Which is not a move that should be applauded since they didn't let their customers choose.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:22:44
Fees in USD go up. I pay the same or less in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:30:32
If you're looking at the fees in USD you're doing it wrong. Bitcoin transaction fees are paid in Bitcoin.
4,191.363 sat/B for a transaction, that's way too expensive.

So what are the fees then ?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:49:16
He is underpaid by more than 1 satoshi since he didn't include the transaction fees too. So it's 0.01000001 BTC that he didn't paid to himself
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:56:34
This is bad too. It's different than them closing but it's still a bad practice we should not encourage.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:58:42
Yep. Regarding the price i pay in BTC it's the same / less because i now choose what i want to pay instead of using whatever the wallet want to use. Because most wallets have a shitty way of calculating what are the needed fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:31:07
Litecoin will have the same problems as Bitcoin if it goes up in adoption and price.

So what ? Because Satoshi wanted to do it we should it ?
Satoshi isn't a fucking god or some master or dictator that we have to listen to and obey no matter what.

First, blockstream != Core.
Second, you don't need Core for the 2nd part of the agreement which is upgrading to 2MB.
Activate SW and planned a HF to 2MB after it, problem solve.
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:11:26
It will as long as a block &gt; 1 MB will be mine.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:48:03
They will have no interest to fork. Since even if they did not send any SW transaction, they might have received some. And even if they never send or received any SW transactions, they have no interest in forking since for sure people who have ever send or received SW txs will stay on the other chain. Forking will just lower the value of their coins.
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:27:54
Actually, we were really a very very very very very small amount of users supporting ETC after the fork. Not a lot of Gh/s, trying to create pools, and attract miners. Without Bitsquare, OTC traders and our lovely small amount of miners we would have die.
It was really hard to preserve that chain but we did it. If i have to do it all again for BTC i will do it. I will stand on my principles no matter what.
As BTC.TOP founder say, put your money where your mouth is. I do and i will. If he want to attack us, be sure that we will fight back. I will not capitulate on someone trying to destroy Bitcoin and make it his thing.

Big miners have reserved through. They will not just run out of money just like that. Or they will stop mining at each drop in the Bitcoin price.
Miners can try to convince the economic majority to join them. So either miners will succeed in it, or they will fail and go back again on the other chain. (or stop mining at all)
But it's possible to have a chain with a majority of hashing power, without a big value. It will just not stay the case for long.
@_date: 2017-02-19 08:45:40
Completely new pool, for which the hashrate come from ViaBTC. High probability that it's link to Jihan or Ver.

This survey is not for any side. Just to see what people from both side think and will do in any cases. That's why i did post it on r/btc too instead of just here. So that i don't have only answers from people that may think like me.

@_date: 2017-02-20 05:20:23
The hashrate you were asking for ? The pool display the hashrate they have with way more accuracy than the estimation based on the proportion of blocks mined.
@_date: 2017-02-19 18:26:00
The speculative accusations are coming from the fact that this is a new pool, and that the exact amount of hashrate of this new pool, has been missing from ViaBTC before juste before the creation of this new pool.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:40:22
Hashing power is easy to get when you are already rich and have the main ASIC manufacturer on your side.

You can use other app if the chrome app is down. Or if you really really really really want to access your coin and that all compatible app/soft that you can use with your Nano S are down. You can use your 24 words to recover your coins.
@_date: 2017-02-01 09:17:28
You can buy mining power. Since the main producer of ASICs is for BU. Looking at hashing power is biased too.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:31:54
That just mean that no pool confirm that they will mine for sure theses transactions send to them.
If you put some more fees than the needed one you will have more chance to be confirmed by a pool on the list of pool you choose.
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:33:01
Promoting the attack of the minority chain even it change is algorithm after the fork to protect itself from the miners that did just do a contencious hard fork with a flow software doesn't bring ANY protection to the chain with the most work.
Oh and it will be a DDOS attack it that case, so we might as well send him into court.
And nobody did want a war except the BU supporter that insult Core, Blockstream everyday.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:44:07
Which wallet do you use ? I don't think it will be implemented in a wallet like Bitcoin Core. But in a wallet like the Ledger App, Electrum why not. Under "advance settings" through because it could be confusing for some users.
And it will need mining pool to participate in that, so they don't relay the transactions until they include it in one of their block.
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:33:12
Seems people are too dumb to know that the two chain can still co-exist.
So attacking the "minority" chain after the fork is an attack.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:29:50
SW need a 95% of miners to signal SW and more than the majority of the nodes are currently SW ready so the risk for a reversion in case it's activated is very low. And no one who have ever done a SW transaction will follow such a fork since they would lost money.
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:27:52
The agreement have no value. Bitcoin Core is not a company but an open-source software develop by anyone who contribute to it. It doesn't have to respect any agreement sign by some devs.

Avalon and Bitfury
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:50:22
Yeah you're right. First they say 6, then someone in the comment point the fact that one of the 6 doesn't work for Blockstream and the other one (BlueMatt ?) left.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:33:16
The only control they have and don't lose (yet) is on their own company.
@_date: 2017-02-20 09:46:29
No it's not. Avalon has been more reliable than Bitmain S9 and R4.
@_date: 2017-02-04 10:49:49
ETH and ETC is an example where both hashing power and economic majority was FOR the hard-fork. I don't think any smart businesses that currently support SW will move to Bitcoin Unlimited chain with all the new attack vector it bring with it.
But even if it's seem unlikely in general it's still a possible outcome.
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:38:34
No they don't. From a post of r/btc : out 16 Bitcoin Core contributors, only 4 were actually working for Blockstream. So much control.
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:31:46
It's not about being use or not, this is for testing, you have the testnet for that. Using the mainnet is useless.
@_date: 2017-03-10 11:31:49
Yeah they did for malleability. They said : "It's not an important problem"
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:53:06
There is Avalon already and Bitfury, if you want to buy some miners. And by looking at some comments by miners, Avalon miners seem to be more reliable than Bitmain's one.
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:28:52
Even if you don't support SegWit using Antpool is tve worst thing you could do since the pool keep the transactions fees. So you will earn way less than miners on others pool.
@_date: 2017-03-06 09:29:59
Higher failure rate for the S9. So the Avalon might still be a better options.

Before the end of the year for sure. Lot of people (me included) are getting tired of this "debate", and since most wallet and businesses are SW ready, there is no reason not to do it. If we don't all of this would have just been a waste of time.

@_date: 2017-03-05 11:01:14
The community and miners always add the same opinions regarding updates until now. The part of the community that want the update just need to organize themself and say: "Hey, the 10 March will start rejecting the block that doesn't enforce BIP xxx"
It's not that simple of course, but the community can do that if the miners aren't honest or just doesn't want to follow the same path of the community.
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:42:14

@_date: 2017-03-10 11:37:04
When your node receive a transaction, it will send it to other nodes only if the transaction fee is &gt; to 0.00002 BTC in this example.
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:02:15
So ? Not because someone else do it that they should.
@_date: 2017-03-06 04:46:18
Don't buy a S9. Bitmain is pro-BU so even if you don't mine on Antpool you will just help them. If you support SW you should buy a miner from Avalon
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:54:09
Changing PoW will change nothing since he will still have the money to create huge farms or develop ASIC for the new PoW
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:58:29


First it's not democratic since most of the users are not able to vote since they are not miners. Second, miners are paid by the network to enforce the rules of Bitcoin, they are not here to choose them. The community aka users, devs, and businesses decide which upgrade they want or not.
@_date: 2017-03-05 10:21:56


Users can enforce the rules by forking even if they don't have the support of the miners. A lot of miners are totally ignorant about how Bitcoin work in details or don't even understand updates that need their supports. The current "debate" prove it. It's not because you have the money to buy a lot of ASICs that you are smart enough to take decision for all the Bitcoin network.


But the system already work like that. If the users don't want an update that is pushed by the devs and the miners we will just fork. It's not because you are a miner that you have Bitcoin's best interest at heart. And what you think might be Bitcoin's best interest might be different than other people.
And there is no need of a voting system.
@_date: 2017-03-05 10:35:32
Rejecting the blocks that doesn't follow the rules they want ? Like any fork.
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:49:34
You seem to confuse SW transactions that are transactions that are on the Bitcoin blockchain and the Lighting Network.
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:28:56
Since we will either have SW or bigger blocks, or both, your data will probably be outdated before the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-03-06 04:58:46
You should try to look at the mining section of bitcointalk. There is a lot of good informations there and experienced miners. And they post a lot of advices there so you might find some usefull informations

Bitcoin can handle it. But for testing purpose you should use the testnet.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:14:25
Most wallet are Segwit ready. So people will quickly make a majority of SW transactions.

@_date: 2019-11-27 17:02:51
If you see the price of Bitcoin is at 1000$ on Exchange A, and it's at 1500$ on Exchange B, the first thing you (and everyone else) will want to do is buying on A and selling on B. Then at some point the price will just become the same.  
Which is why you never see a big difference in term of price between exchanges, and if you do it's because of hidden costs such as the cost to deposit, withdraw, trade, etc...
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:08:46
If you have to ask the question, i don't think you should go with neither of them. Get yourself either a Ledger Nano S or Trezor it will be better for you. And you can connect the Nano S to your phone if it's an Android so you can even use it while outside.

That's not how you safely create a paper wallet. You need an 100% clean computer that have no connection with the outside world. A printer that is not connected to any network (so probably an old one that you can use with a cable).
Once you have print your wallets, wipe out completely your computer and your printer if it have some kind of internal memory.

Quick message: The article was edited after i've posted the link with the charge against him. And it's apparently because he may be link to the creation of a malware. Which, regarding what the infosec community know of him or about Kronos, doesn't seem to be the case. But anyway, he doesn't change my point that organizing conferences or events in the U.S. (A country that spy on everyone, that ask companies to put backdoors in their products, and that reserve the right to just check all devices of someone entering the country and that ask you about all your social media accounts) is a very bad idea. Even more if your event or conference is about Bitcoin / cryptocurrencies or security related.

Look at the time they did post their articles regarding on why he have been arrested : 
And the time i've post the link.
Btw there is a lot of contradiction regarding if he is or not the creator of Kronos. You should look at some infosec community member twitter account to see for yourself.
And anyway he doesn't change my point that we should stop organizing conferences or events in the US. Just at the frontier it's already a shit to get in since they reserved the right to check into your personal devices and want the links to your social media accounts. And let's not forget that the U.S. is spying over everyone.
All of this make the U.S. for organizing conferences and events. Above all Bitcoin/crypto and security events.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:07:52
Except that if you spend that much on Bitcoin mining you have actually no interest at all of doing a 51% attack. Because we can just reject your blocks or change the PoW algorithm and you will end up with useless ASICs. The price may drop during the attack but it would not even cover the cost of the attack even if you short Bitcointo the ground.
So we shouldn't be that much scared of a 51% attack.

Please stop upvoting that shitty article. The 'news' is at least 8 months old and no they're not making an exchange, they're just securing domain names. Nothing special about that. They already bought bitcoin related domain 3/4 years ago and didn't do anything with it so don't get over excited for no reason. And it would be way smarter for them to just buy an existing exchange rather than building one if they really want one.  
Btw, smart way to promote your website u/manhar2108. Not really ethical I would say, but smart.

It was fixed. But anyway it doesn't solve the problem to buy straight from the manufacturer since the device can be compromised during the shipping process. Also if you have a lot of funds, using one HW is bad from a security point of view. Better to use multiple HW from different brands and vendors and create a multisig with them. So like that even if one HW was compromised, you're fine. And even if all of them are compromised, they would have to be compromised by the same entity for you to loose your fund so again, you would be fine.

I use BlockFi both for their Interest Account and I also have a loan with them.
The Interest Account so far has been good, didn't tried to withdraw yet since I will probably take another loan with them later anyway.
For the loan, the process is simple, once you sign the contract they send you the money to your bank account (even internationally - I'm in Dubai and it was a quick process). Didn't try to pay out the loan yet. The only thing that bother me a bit is that the interest rate is counted toward the collateral you have to put down, which increase the amount you have to trust them with.  
EDIT: If you can't afford (both financially and mentally) to loose the coins you want to put in their Interest Account, don't do it.

Bitcoin.org gives you a choice between a lot of odd **wallets** with Bitcoin Knots as the first choice. I've been in Bitcoin for over 4 years and WTF is Bitcoin Knots??
The second choice is Bitcoin.core FFS. They are both full clients that will download the entire blockchain. New users will just give up. A full client is not a light introduction to bitcoin!
There should be a Bitcoin Quick Start that just gets you going with Coinbase or something (boooo Coinbase I know but what's better for noobs?), obviously with a highlighted bit that explains that you don't own your coins if you entrust them to Coinbase.


And Coinbase, the exchange you recommend, is also an online wallet. Which is why, since you didn't mention at any time the word exchange, that i did through we were talking about, guess what, **wallets**.


Like i do it every month at my monthly Bitcoin meetup. I give them a list of different exchanges such as Coinbase (here in Dubai it would Bitoasis and not Coinbase) and localbitcoins, and then i tell them that they should move their BTC away from an exchange if they're not trading and to put them, in a wallet they control. So either a soft or an hardware wallet. And i strickly insist on **not** using web-wallets such as Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Bitoasis etc... I also precise that regarding 'software wallets' such as Electrum, the safety of their BTC depend of the safety of their device, and that for HW wallets, that they should keep their 24 words safe because it's what will give them access to their BTC in case they can't access the device for whatever reason.
@_date: 2019-06-09 12:40:59
All this hate of Ledger damn.
First of all, being close source isn't bad. Shaming Ledger for that is ridiculous since they *can't* open source their soft.
Second, we should all be happy that we have honest security researchers searching for flaws in HW and reporting them correctly.
Seed extraction is easy (as per the talk) on Trezor, but he never said that Ledger was better. He said that the way they used wouldn't work on a Ledger device because the kind of chips they use is different.
Relaying on only one kind of HW is bad no matter what. To mitigate risks users should use multisig through multiple HW. So if Trezor is broken you're still safe, or if Ledger is broken you're still safe. Both being broken at the same time is less likely.
We should support a diverse ecosystem of HW, and not critize security researchers for finding flaws and disclosing them responsibly.
@_date: 2019-06-09 14:15:59

Don't trust, verify.  
As much as I enjoy Apple stand on privacy you still have to trust them. And by being an huge American corporation it would be foolish to think that their products are not compromised by US intel agencies.

If you want to have a wallet on your iPhone with pocket money in it to buy coffee at Starbuck, compromised or not it doesn't matter much.

In order to loose them they would need to have them at first.

Doesn't matter if it's a quick start or not, and if there is warnings or not. Because most people don't look at them anyway. At least recommend wallets were people own their keys such as Electrum.
Again, recommending website like Coinbase, no matter the amount of warnings you put, to noobs is a very bad idea. Even more if you do it on bitcoin.org

Hardware wallet are safer than online services like blockchain.info or an app on your phone. So no you don't spend 0$ for the same security.
And regarding that :


That's why you have to note down the seed (the 24 words) in case anything happen to your wallet.
Hardware wallet are both secure, easy to use and practical. It's the worth the amount of money they cost (and Trezor is not the only that do hardware wallet. Ledger offer wallets that cost way less than 100$)

We should boycott Bitpay and every centralize services like it that break our privacy.

The whole reason why the Yellow Vests don't go negotiate with the gov it's because the gov will talk to people that represent the Yellow Vests and they keep telling that they have none.

- Illegal sex: it's not legal to have sex with someone of the same sex or someone you're not married with. And base on that definition, if you're raped, then you will end up charged for sex outside marriage.

A pow change doesn't f*cking solve the problem that we will forever have large miners like those that will try to take more power. It will not be ASIC farms but GPU farms but we will still end up anyway with the same problem.
The solution to the miner problem is to stop relaying on them for changes on Bitcoin. They either follow the new rules or we just orphan their blocks. And we should really try to boycott bad actors of the ecosystem that promote theses changes. It's cool to complain about the miners in this case but they are not the one that did create 2X.

There is no need for a rush hardfork if services like Shapeshift would just use SW.
You want people to follow an agreement made by big companies (are we still talking about Bitcoin here ?) because it was the plan, and that we need scalability but you don't even use the tools that can help us scale.
And don't worry i will do everything i can to protect the minority chain, like i did with Ethereum Classic, Replay protection or not. Because no replay protection isn't here to help the minority chain or encourage a chain split. It's here to protect USERS. They are one the number you use an argument sometimes, in case you did forgot that they are real people.
And sorry but miner or company support mean nothing when it's just a small amount of people controlling them. Jihan is owning a minimum of 25% of the hashrate alone. That's really representative of the community for sure.

ASICs are not the problems. Monopolies are. Could be the same problem later on if Bitcoin become big enough with those who make GPUs or CPUs.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:57:48
Could you all stop with all your PoW change fetish ? Like it's not going to change anything. Bitmain will still be rich enough to work on ASICs for the new algorithm or to setup GPUs farm to mess up with us. It's not like Bitmain is relaying only on Bitcoin mining to make money (They are into Litecoin &amp; Dogecoin too - with their scrypt ASIC) or that their ASIC will be obsolete after the change. They will either stop their SHA-256 asic or use them on altcoins such as Namecoin (and have an incentive to make it grow). And the fact is that a PoW change will not only impact Jihan but everyone even SW supporters and/or honest miners. A PoW change will have to be done **only** when double SHA-256 will not be secure enough.

LN implementations should NOT be implemented into Bitcoin Core. Could be added to other wallets such as Electrum or others, but Bitcoin Core should not implement any of them.
Or if you really want LN implementations to be on Bitcoin Core, add a 'plug-in' system to it so anyone could easily add any LN implementation to it.

Guess you doesn't seem to unserstand my comment. SegWit has been tested. But there is always differences between the live environment and the testing environment. So we will have to analyze how the network react to SW before doing anymore updates like that.

Yes. Core is fighting **for** a block size increase named SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:56:36
SegWit + 2MB HF may have a lot of support but should not be done. Because we don't what will be the impact of SW on the network so we should only do theses changes one by one, with a break between them to see how they affect the network so we can improve what need to be improve, and make other change if needed, and proceed or not to the next step (depending if we still need it or not, if it preserve Bitcoin decentralization and security or not...)
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:21:16

@_date: 2017-05-27 19:42:39


Except that layer 2 need txs to be done on-chain so we will have to increase the blocksize or find a way to do more transactions on-chain anyway. Miners didn't watch the initial talk about LN or what ?

@_date: 2017-05-18 22:16:21


It's not about principles. It's about doing things safely and not rushing because **we don't know what the impact of SW will be on the network**. Maybe SW will be enough even after 1 year. Maybe we will find a new way of scaling on-chain without pushing the blocksize. Maybe people will just use LN.
Bitcoin should go one step at a time and not compromise or rush for anything. SW is ready and have been tested, and will help with more than just scaling on-chain. So let's go for SW, and see how the network react.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:27:07
For sure because SegWit is a blocksize increase ;p

UASF + that is enough. If enough pro-SW people do it, then they might see a decrease of revenue that will be big enough to make them react in the "right" way.
It's not a magic solution for sure, but in the long-term boycotting bad actors it's the good way to go because it will reduce their profits and might discourage other people to act against the network interest.

There is no compromise to do god dammit. We can't say "hey we're going to set the blocksize to 2MB in a maximum than 12 months after getting SW" because we don't know what the impact SW will have on the network.
SW have been tested yes, but we might discover a lot of things to improve or change in production and it's normal. We can't put random deadlines just because some random CEOs say we should stick to them. So let's activate SW, see what effect it bring to the network, improve and change what we can and should be changed, and then, if needed if it's possible while keeping Bitcoin as decentralized and secure as possible, change the max blocksize to 2MB.

Changing PoW doesn't solve anything. It just move away the problem for a few hours / days / months. And the problem is: You don't need to be smart to be a miner, you just need money.
And as long as we will rely on miner signalling to proceed any change to the network, we will be vulnerable.
If you want to solve the problem, you need to support UASF and other way of doing upgrades to the network that don't involve miner signalling so we can find out what will be better than what we have right now.

Segwit2x just show that corporate are in control. A blocksize increase is stupid when you have other smarter way like SW or Schnorr Signature (SS) to scale both on-chain and off-chain.
It's not because some people don't have any imagination (or are too stupid) to think of any other way of scaling than a blocksize increase that we should follow them blindly.
And no you can't use any other dev team like that, because the Core devs have experience that the other have not which make all the difference.

PoW change should not be on the table. Because if we do radical change such as a PoW change just because of Bitmain that mean all other options failed, or we didn't try them (which is stupid). And the fact that a PoW doesn't bring any incentive for people to invest in securing Bitcoin.
In my opinion we should think of a PoW change only if there is any big flaw in it that can't be fix.
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:13:59
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:45:32


There will be at least 1 miner supporting it. And we can always fork to adjust the difficulty.


Less incentive since you could get rekt by a PoW change at any time.


Jihan will not be out because he have enough money to invest in GPU mining farms to go and mine on the new chain. PoW change doesn't solve anything. It just piss off honest miners.
And the big question is : Which PoW algo will we use ?
Script ? X11 ? A new one ? Who will decide ? The community ? We can't even agree on something that don't harm anyone (SW) so a PoW change it will be even harder. And any insider if it's decided in private will be able to have a competitive advantage on other miners.
And if we do a PoW change, nothing will block some rogue miners in the future to prepare a new PoW algorithm, prepare some ASICs or at list some FPGA for it, piss off everyone on the chain so people ask for a PoW change and propose the change anonymously using an alias. And it's merge, he would enjoy huge profits.
There is a lot of downside regarding a PoW change. Something like BIP 148 is way more interesting and way safer rather than a PoW change. And can't really fail since we could just adjust the difficulty in case we're stuck.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:35:04
Because a lot of exchanges, websites that do a lot of transactions and wallets have a bad algorithm for their dynamic fees or simply use fixed fees. And some could even use less space by doing multiple withdraw in 1 transaction but don't do it.

Sorry but no. Miners are not here to protect Bitcoin development. They are here to secure the network not to decide weather or not we should upgrade x or y.


Who's the community in that case ? Some business owner that do a meeting in NY ? SegWit2x is a Trojan Horse. We should not accept it because if we accept it w're not better than Paypal. Guided by a bunch of business owner that care more about their company than Bitcoin itself. And the timing for it is way too low. Not enough testing. And since a lot of Core developers are against it, it add just another reason to why we should be against it.

No the solution isn't to change the PoW. Because it will doesn't block any other actor (Or even Jihan) to come and piss us off once we've change the algorithm.
I will quote some of my previous posts :


In my opinion we should think of a PoW change only if there is any big flaw in it that can't be fix.


And the big question is : Which PoW algo will we use ? Script ? X11 ? A new one ? Who will decide ? The community ? We can't even agree on something that don't harm anyone (SW) so a PoW change it will be even harder. And any insider if it's decided in private will be able to have a competitive advantage on other miners.
And if we do a PoW change, nothing will block some rogue miners in the future to prepare a new PoW algorithm, prepare some ASICs or at list some FPGA for it, piss off everyone on the chain so people ask for a PoW change and propose the change anonymously using an alias. And it's merge, he would enjoy huge profits.
There is a lot of downside regarding a PoW change. Something like BIP 148 is way more interesting and way safer rather than a PoW change. And can't really fail since we could just adjust the difficulty in case we're stuck.

Because UASF doesn't reject non-SW transaction. We're just rejecting hostile miners, not users.

Why would Core get behind an agreement signed behind closed doors by private companies ? And SegWit2x is either not enough tested or not tested at all compare to Core way of doing things usually. Core should not support this take over of Bitcoin by companies.
We should not try to negotiate or compromise with miners that care more about their profits (or whatever their incentives are) than they care about Bitcoin. SegWit or nothing, and then once SW is activate we will have other and better way to scale such as Schnorr Signature.

People are here to make profits mostly, not to hold or even use ETH or BTC or whatever.

Don't forget poloniex who pay more than 400+ sat / byte at every withdraw. sometimes it's even more than 570+ sat / byte

It's the only one. For the other pool, either you like it, or you leave it.

So Bitfury just betrayed bitcoiners. Sad day. The NYA should be rejected by all bitcoiners.
Supporting an agreement that was done in private by bunch of corporate is against what Bitcoin stand for. And it doesn't even respect the FOSS philosophy.
The NYA is worse than BU because like BU they don't do a lot of testing before pushing software into production and they don't care about what the users think. If we let the NYA pass, we will have a Bitcoin driven by corporate that don't care about the FOSS philosophy, don't care about safety, and don't care about security. What they only care about it's their businesses.
Bitcoin is our chain. Not ShapeshiftChain, not BitfuryChain, not BitmainChain, or BitcoinDotComChain. Decisions about how we should upgrade the protocol should be done and discussed in public through BIP or the mailing list. Code should be well tested for months before being pushed into the mainnet etc... Not rushed because some businesses need to make more profit.

Schnorr Signature for example. You can find more informations about it here :  or here : 
Reduce the size of the signature part from 64 bytes instead of 71-72. *And if you use a 2-of-3 (work for any n-of-n) multisig address, instead of having 2 sig like we have right now, only one signature of constant size will be used.* (Simplified explanation, for the details check the link) Which allow us to gain A LOT of space because a lot of -(big) services that do a lot of txs use multisig such as Kraken or Bitstamp (Because of BitGo Instant service).

First, Core didn't have to follow the HK agreement. And second, the HK agreement is as shitty as the NYA.

Yep that would be a good possibility. But it's not like they can verify each donation that come to them so it's a bit harsh from Coinbase to just lock the account without sending any informations on why. Even if it wasn't them, anyone depositing money to Coinbase that would see his money lock without any explicit reason will be upset and say it publicly. Best way for Coinbase to get bad press for no reason.

The community should not support SegWit2x. There is a lot of upgrades that we will be able to do that will allow us to scale more on-chain without increasing the blocksize already.

Not the same. Avalon re-formed as a new group some years ago. Yifu Guo have left.

People will not go back to Bitcoin. Because for that to happen they should leave first. When you buy alts it's just to get more BTC in fine

Sorry but it's a war. Either Bitcoin is rule by miners profits, or it's rule by the users. The only one that are winning right now are the miners because they are earning a shitload of money by blocking SW. Either we fight back with BIP 148 or we die. And a taking over by corporate with Segwit2x is even worth than Bitcoin control by miners.
