Don’t give up! They resolved my issue after a few days of creating the new account.

No, old phone is gone. New phone(new number) was restored using the old iPhone’s back up, but the old codes were not transferred when I opened the Authenticator app

I Tried support. They said they can’t do anything except point me to the same instructions page over and over again. I left the few support tickets. They claimed the tickets are backlogged. I’m not really sure what that means or when they will update the site to add that  “code not working” button they keep telling me to click.

Yeah I wasn’t  aware of what is considered best practice for using google Authenticator. All I did was add it to my phone and scan the coinbase bar code.

Same issue with the app

iTunes back up. I don’t have the old phone anymore.

Tried with Safari, Firefox, and chrome. All had the same result. I also tried all of these in private/incognito mode

Will do. People seem to recommend it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:15:58
Tried all of the above. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:19:34
Great! I’ll try that. But they should still update their support and recovery process.

Not sure. all I did was get it from the App Store and scan the code on the site
