A single confirmation is theoretically supposed to take 10 minutes (differs slightly in practice). To transfer between exchanges requires 3-6 confirmations, so you're looking at a ballpark of 30-60 minutes.

As fast as anybody... As fast as it takes to get the confirmations. I know it wouldn't be risk-free arbitrage, but my thinking is that if Bitstamp is stuck below $300 for a while due to the massive sell wall, this could drive up prices on the other exchanges until the sell wall has completely filled. This will likely take longer than moving coins between exchanges.

Didn't even try it--I learned about the sell wall right before bedtime. I posted this question on Reddit thinking more about whether arbitrage in a scenario like this was possible *in theory*; maybe if it happens again I'll pursue it!

The SEC certainly would not approve of that.

Bitcoin is still not widely known to the everyday investor. Most people wouldn't even know how to buy a Bitcoin. However, having a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) means any investor with a brokerage account (eTrade, Ameritrade, etc.) can now get in on the game and more or less trade Bitcoin. This puts new demand on Bitcoin, and because it has a limited supply, the prices could go up substantially.

Thanks! So the announcement will pop up to the top of the Chronological list?

Their office is in Flatiron (Manhattan neighborhood) so my bet is on one of the posh establishments nearby--the NoMad, Flatiron Room, etc.
