***The price is manipulated*** by coinmarketcap.com, cnbc.com, forbes.com, cointelegraph.com, coindesk.com and to proof it you need to open a few window in your browser and refresh a few of that windows in 10 minutes. Every 15 minutes billions "disappear" from marketcap and every 10 minutes this corporations from United States coming out with headlines which saying that Bitcoin is shit, and terrorism, and criminals and in the end of the article offering Ripple which is created by a cryptographer from the National Security Agency NSA. They was able to take down the dominance of the Bitcoin to 33% with creating many altcoins and fear among people. Well, looks like the top 1% did a great job because you stupid people have sold your Bitcoins for some shit and made yourself a speculative fuck.

(WAKE UP! YOU ARE OWNED BY GOV AND CORPS!)[
The top 1% did not calculate into they game that if Bitcoin falling they altcoins will became ***WORTHLESS***! Let's see how much will cost one Ripple if the Bitcoin price goes down to 7.000 USD. Last time when Bitcoin was 9.000 USD than Ripple was about 0.89 !!!! Basically what the governments did is made you sell your Bitcoins and now regulate how you can buy back them. If the altcoins what you get for exchange your Bitcoins fall down to 0 USD you can go out to the garden and hang yourself because governments and U.S corporate media just wiped your money out of your packet. This happens if you listen to them and you are speculative. You going to loose now everything!
