No. The discount is only for the rich. You didn't think they were planning to sell to the common man, did you?

This is the third time I've seen "BitCoin" referenced as a negative. Google is no help. What's the reference to?
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:01:37
You're in the black? I don't think there's a color better than black. Cash out now, you've won!
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:50:44
Ah. Fine detective work, Soapy
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:05:58
Yeah. They're the ones bringing attention to Bitcoin right now. They are my friend today.
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:57:38
This sounds like great news. This will be so much easier to direct people to. "Just buy it on overstock.com" This seems to me to be a HUGE step forward on the biggest problem of crypto: ease of use. If this covers the back end, and we already have some decent wallets for storage, then we just need to focus on making the spending part easier (I'm a fan of NFC for that).

Prove it!

Perfect! I throw a  Chanukkah party every year and go through tons of chocolate coins when I teach all the guests how to play dreidel. Now I can covertly combine these parts of my life.

I don't get it. Even in the bch forums they talk about how embarrassing he is. Who's sending these invites then?
@_date: 2014-07-22 12:41:20
They should pay it in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-17 04:51:50
Lol. Even the bots can't swallow that pill.
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:58:41
Exactly. He could have sold his collection at any time and used his expertise to buy similar pieces online to make some money. He wasn't doing that because it wasn't worth his time. The thief forced him to do all this work even after the mom made him financially whole. The thief and Mom don't deserve his work for free.
He worked and made profit. Good for him.

I think we as a community will have to accept that many people will never understand the underlying technology but still create a system that allows them to safely use it.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:13:56
What a time to join! Lol! I agree though. When I started I was scared to death that I was going to send my money to the wrong address or lose the key, so I took my time as I learned it. I am in the tech field too so I am generally ahead of the curve. What about the people who liked the idea and support it without knowing the ins and outs? I think we need to be more supportive as a community to help bring more people in. It only helps us to get everyone involved!

Looking at what ethereum classic did I'm in no rush to sell. HODLx2!

Every time it dies it reinforces the floor and indicates a coming bull.
@_date: 2019-02-24 01:49:11
Plan your buys and sells months in advance. If anyone could accurately predict the market the system wouldn't work.
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:31:10
Yeah. Brilliantly planned.
@_date: 2019-04-06 05:01:54
Bitcoin is a crutch until money is obsolete, but then the blockchain will still be useful.
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:23:41
Whoever Satoshi is, it's clear they don't want us to know. It's better that we don't know anything for sure
... Except that CSW is a fraud.
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:21:14
That's awesome.

You should try coinplay.io  One of my friends developed it and it has caused me to get very into indie games.
@_date: 2018-11-12 00:16:01
Good advise to the OP.
@_date: 2018-11-18 21:55:24
I actually held GM when they magically dissolved, so I may not be the best at investing strategy. I'm just a simple long term investor.
@_date: 2018-11-18 20:05:58
Exactly. It's hard to do, but recognizing the lack of hope as a bottom to spring from really helps you to hold when otherwise fear would take over. Never sell low!
I don't program well, but "if low, don't sell" seems like something that you could leave up to automation.
@_date: 2018-11-18 22:11:05
M'eh. My strategy worked once (luck), so I'm going to ride my strategy for a few presidential terms.
Just being honest.
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:36:38
It is! It'll be great for a few years, maybe. After that... I'm not sure you are going to like it. You'll have evaded those taxes though.
@_date: 2018-11-18 21:47:30
In which direction? We can make it say whatever.

My insurance company is my bank! I've been duped!

I came back ten hours later to reply because I just got why this is the top comment.

One Costco please.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:15:38
Cover it in it's own plan just like jewellery and electronics.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:13:20
Walk. Even more Bitcoin.

I love that you have to fake a Starbucks drink. Lol.

Once again, the conservative, T-shirt-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:41:12
Dig UP, Darn it!
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:32:32
I was hoping to start adding on to the Bitcoin obituary page. Every time "Bitcoin is dead" I know to invest. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:44:02
I'm 99% in agreement with you, except for the outcome. We will never "know" if he would have been proven guilty (or see an amazing defense), so what we have is a court putting him in jail for what was said before. 
We just aren't happy that he is in jail for something so trivial.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:24:48
Me too
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:08:44
He wasn't proven guilty of it. That's the argument. It's argued that if he had done it then they would have charged him with it. I haven't seen a good counterargument even though it's most likely to have been him.
