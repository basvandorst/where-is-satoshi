How can you say with a straight face that 'it's all a scam' when the technology behind bitcoin and some of the others is actually really exciting, and not a scam? Unless you don't understand the technology of course

How can it be a scam if I've never lost any money? Like, ngl if you don't get that tokens and most ICOs are scammy you're stupid. I'm just pointing out that it's not 'all a scam' it's just some parts are being used as a scam by some people, bc loads of people with no understanding of tech or anything want to use it as a get rich quick scheme.

Erm, if you were tactical you definitely would be. Only if you're stupidly investing money that you can't invest would you be disappointed.

"Absolutely no effect*" and no, that's completely false. History always plays a role.

You... have completely misunderstood the purpose of this prediction. Under their reckoning, any time it was above the curve it was overvalued.

They do pay them the same, do they not? They give extra pension bonuses to women based on their internal statistics that regard women as being disadvantaged in that department, for whatever reason. Obviously your intellectual dishonesty forbids you from recognising that there are many businesses out there that pay women less for the same job as men, though they don't put it on their website.

I'm not saying you're stupid, however bitcoin as an implementation of the technology is incredibly exciting imo. I get you, also i'd like to note than in your reply to me you straight did the same thing I did to you lol. I have a satisfactory understanding of the topic, i do compooters for a living
