Not too much - first with prediction you can "sell" it early by predicting on the other site before the event happens. Thus you can make a profit (or a loss) just by the change of the odds (likelihood) of the event. On the other hand you can invest in stocks with a lever too lose your hole investment by a small price drop (Or obv. win even more).
I mean there are things that are clearly gambling (betting on soccer games) and there are things that are clearly investing (buying regular blue chip stocks e.g.) but in between you find everything and I think it is not possible to draw a clear line.

In my opinion this is a sign that Bitcoin is "grown up". Bitcoins stored in muti-sig addresses can provide way more security. However, until today there is a lack of useable multi-sig wallets.

Yes, that is my hope that they will give them to people who held Bitcoin - even if I don't know Japanase law. My further hope is that the 200,000 BTC is not the hole story yet. According to this bet some people think there is a decent chance:

The site (Fairlay.com) determines the outcome that will trigger the payment. It would be nice if this would be done in a decentralized way but this is difficult. The use of this: realitykeys.com is a step in the right direction. A more complex solution is this:  It is a new crypto currency where all share holder can vote on the outcome of such events.

The concept of a prediction market is known since a long time. Bitcoin is an enabler for this cool tool. Coindesk wrote an article about this topic some times ago:

update: you now would get your money 100 times back.
@_date: 2014-05-18 00:50:07
If people how are interested in Bitcoin would buy Bitcoin directly instead of buying a miner at BFL it would be better for all... For them because they get more BTC, for other miner since the hash rate would go up less quick and for the hole Bitcion economy since every Bitcoin buy supports the price and thus the size of the economy.
Thus I think this prediction should be spread to show people how unlikely a BFL Monarch will be a good investment.

@_date: 2014-12-04 13:57:50
in my opinion bigger pools are exposed more to this risk since as an attacker you don't want to have more shares of each pool than your share of the global hashrate. Lets say you have 1% of the global hashrate. Going for small pools might just not be worth the hassle.
I don't agree that p2pool is most vulnerable. Since they give 0.5% of the block reward to the miner who found it they are at least safe against attacks from everyone with less than 0.5% of the global HR. Ok- more precise: no one with less than 0.5% has in incentive to attack them.

@_date: 2014-08-20 14:38:47
yes - the bitcoins are "missing" in the sense that they are cashed out to the hackers. But this should be in the "books", since this have been regular sells of regular user. So after such sell the hackers have real BTC and the user have FAKE fiat. No the hacker withdraw Bitcoin. So the books of MtGox should say "we have very little bitcoin but a hell lot of fiat" - and then the fiat is missing because it was initially created out of thin air. Of course the Bitcoins are also not there but they should know that - so they are not "missing".

@_date: 2014-11-17 20:51:18
In my opinion Bitcoin has already the problem that acquiring &gt;50% costs always less than the value of having &gt;50%. Even when assuming linear costs for hashrate and ignoring economy of scale. (Compare [slide 18](
Sidechains could open this "business opportunity" for smaller actors.

@_date: 2014-12-30 14:15:04
Note that this is only true because of the current miner policies. They can change it any time for example to "replace by higher tx fees" This would make 0 con transactions immediately VERY insecure.

this is a good example how close useful and dangerous thinks are together. Betting that your own house will burn down is nothing else but a fire insurance. (And this can obv. be a useful thing) But if you have a free market on such a thing and some else has an incentive that your house burns down it becomes problematic.
On the other site prices for insurances could become way cheaper with a open market. 
I do not have a solution to decide what should be allowed and what not. And even if I had it will become very difficult to forbid/regulate bets/predictions since all the necessary pieces of a prediction market can be divided in such small pieces that every piece on its own is clearly legal. (See  multi-sig transaction)
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:10:52
you can't. Don't underestimate variance. You can not distinguish bad luck from fraud. (At least not if the miner spends &lt;$100k) 100k is just an educated guess. But just to make this clear: you have to spend roughly the value of one block to find one block on average in lifetime. And block - about $7500 is really NO sample size at all.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:22:32

slide 11: 
formulars here: (f1(x) = (1-x) * x ; f2(x) = x; f3(x) =x- ((1-x) * x ); f4(x) =  (x- ((1-x) * x ))/(1 - ((1-x) * x));f5(x) = (((x- ((1-x) * x ))/(1 - ((1-x) * x))) +((((1-x) * x)/(1-x))*(1-x))); f6(x) = ((((1-x) * x)/(1-x))*(1-x)) )plot from 0 to 1
Basically if you have x% of global hashrate you want to hold x% of very pool you can.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:48:48
Would you agree to this summary: Sidechains allow to lock Bitcoins with a specific number of hash operations needed to unlock them. Now the assumption (vague hope?) ist that only a honest group of people building together a sidechain can reach this number of hash operations. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 14:52:01
I am really eager to read about them...
If someone would offer me a bet I would not hesitate to bet on "for miners with a live time expectation of finding one block (a miner investing $5000 has less) there is NO way to detect block withholding other than doing the exact same amount for work"
Hm..., ok, maybe one thing: if you already know about a block you can "test" the miner by giving him exactly a pice of work where he will find a block - and see if he does report it. You can only do this if the miner does not know that this block has been found already. Normally a pools wants to publish a block as fast as possible - however, "selfish mining" has been proven to be profitable - so a "advanced" pool could do this. Check the loyalty of his miners and do "selfish mining" at the same time...
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:22:52
currently it is 13% - I would still count that as "about 10%" - no?

@_date: 2014-08-08 13:40:30
I think there is no clear line between gambling and investing/ hedging a risk. Here you can bet/predict on the future difficulty: 
You can say it is pure gambling but if you are a miner you can bet on a raising difficulty to hedge against it and protect your mining investment.

@_date: 2015-05-04 04:27:24
it is good to keep the discussion running with this proposal. However - I am pretty sure a hard fork will only happen when the is a very very urgent need for it. I do not see it happen in 2016 and on the prediction market the likelihood for this event is only traded at around 10%. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:48:49
but don't you think that in a period of two weeks not at least one mining pool is curious and wants to test the new block limit? I am very sure that this would happen...
I mean for a pool it is easy to bloat a block with fake transactions at no costs.
@_date: 2015-05-04 18:20:22
but it will [most likely not happen that soon.](
However - it is important to keep the discussion running. In my opinion a good upgrade should contain several things: 
A dynamic block size limit that is changed like the difficulty but based on the transaction fees and volume of the last 2016 blocks. Furthermore transaction fees should either be distributed to more than one miner (e.g. to the last 10 blocks) or a part of the fees should be destroyed. Otherwise it is to cheap and easy for miners to fake transaction volume.
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:57:51
sorry to be that guy but it turned out that it was a pretty bad idea. The claim transaction contained all infos to claim the reward and before it was confirmed bots tried to double spend it with that exact same info.
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:59:15
and actually maybe not even the person who created the tx got it. It might well be that it was "sniped" by a bot. See: 
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:14:45
oups... but it obv. had a hole and about 18k BTC went through it...
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:22:39
I guess I should add that this is obv. only possible if someone takes the other side. In this concrete example this means that someone else has to place the same amount against Snowden leaving Russia. He will pay the additional money (if Snowden leaves) but he will get the money if Snowden stays.
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:33:53
In Gavins code March 01 2016 is the date the change should happen. The relevant date for resolving the bet is March 14. - so is was written specifically addressing Gavins proposal.
Anyway - you are right, more predictions with other time frames are interesting as well.
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:24:42
there are still very good reasons to believe they will not be back so soon. Currently you get 7 times your money back if you bet on the event that they will be back before the 8th: 
That means that the market sees only a small chance in the promised quick return.
And even for the end of the month people are sceptical:
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:37:07
true, but still 8 people who are willing to put money on the prediction can come up with a more realistic forecast compared to 100 people just saying something.

I know that no one here wants to hear that but it is true that POS solves that problem. Buying more coins does not give you a discounts, accumulating more ASICS and running them efficient does. Mining was a great way for this initial coin distribution (a problem POS does not solve).

In my opinion everything about mini miners (asic in a toaster) makes no sense at all. Mining will never be about the absolute hashrate and the absolute costs but always about the costs compared to others and the hashrate compared to others. A data center in Iceland (with close to free energy and free cooling) will always be significantly more cost efficient than the toaster. And I don’t see any good reasons for people to waste money for the asic in the toaster.

he means you could create an invalid block. A block that has a valid proof of work but invalid transactions in it. The opportunity costs to do this are (currently) 25BTC. If a client only checks for a valid POW (of the latest block) than you could indeed make this client believe that you have an arbitrary amount of BTC.
