But you derive the protocol with subjective and inexact human interpretation of source code. It's the same problem that you have if you want to write automated debugging tool - how do you know that a line of code that *obviously* looks like a bug isn't there intentionally because the author wanted the application to crash when executing that line for some, possibly deranged, reason. Same with Bitcoin, how do we know Satoshi didn't want bitcoin to crumble when encountering that input as Bitcoin is what reference implementation is. Maybe MtGox just used poor wording.. although at this point I think I unintentionally started playing the devil's advocate. :P

You are a fucking moron. It has been proven that Charlie Shrem knowingly aided criminal conspiracy (saying that as someone who likes voluntaryism). HSBC laundered money, but that they did it knowingly was not established in the court of law. Arguing otherwise is arguing for arbitrary punishments for arbitrary people. Maybe I should unsub, the crazy in here.

Because it was written by morons for morons. But educate yourself further on Roughly PHP as a language is comparable to BASIC or Matlab, it's anachronistic and not well-rounded. It's a severely polished turd. Now, it isn't impossible to write secure PHP nowadays, but it used to be that PHP encouraged horribly insecure practices. Which isn't the point. The point is that it's an ugly language and one should use any other far saner language from the list you provided before attempting PHP.

Meh, I'm a closeted ancap and I'm playing devil's advocate here - I don't know anything about HSBC case, but what if the reason why they don't get punished is that it's owned by multiple parties and it doesn't make sense to punish everyone by closing the bank when likely only one portion was responsible, but the state couldn't establish which persons were behind the wrongdoing?

Is there official bitcoin protocol specification? In my limited research, I've found only the whitepaper, which is incredibly handwavy and useless and then there's the reference client which everyone refers to. If there's a problem in the reference client, isn't there also a problem with the protocol because the protocol is never well defined except by the implied understanding that everyone is supposed to infer from the source code of the reference client?
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:41:32
You are probably right, though to be fair the wikis your link is referring to and the documentation for bitcoin protocol/bitcoind is fucking terrible as you are expected to hunt for info all over the web or read source code of the reference implementation (which you should, but shouldn't be necessary if the protocol was documented properly in one place in a concise manner).

Me think that if NSA could crack Tor they would keep it hidden for counterintelligence purposes against Chinese and Russian government and not burn it on some low drug operation. Besides, tor is not that hard to misconfigure if you are a derp (and iinm Silk Road was written in PHP so..).

Did he leave his name on anything cryptocurrency before his 2008 paper? If that's indeed the inventor of Bitcoin then my theory is that he left crumbs on the internet in the period between 2001 and 2008 (that maybe went undiscovered by the public) when Bitcoin was not even his petproject, just an idea he played around without an intent of releasing anything. Later  that idea materialized into the project and with that his intent to stay anonymous. That brought the fear that if he changed his name to a pseudonym then people finding old crumbs would be able to connect the new pseudonym with older persona of Satoshi Nakamoto and then know Satoshi Nakamoto was his real name that he tries to hide. From that stance staying with Satoshi was much better position from then on as he was known by another name for 40 years and only someone digging through official records could come up with the connection, something he possibly wasn't aware was so easily attainable.

No, most vulnerabilities in java are for client-side, server-side java is entirely different beast. 


You can use C properly and not experience hacks. NASA does that. Doesn't mean that there aren't tons of people with feet blown off because of C. But that's beyond the point. PHP is fugly, it should've died a long time ago, but it survives for the same reason Cobol and Fortran survive. And you are still missing the point, PHP doesn't make stuff insecure, it just casts doubt on one's abilities.

Injecting creates artificial value, when everyone wants to sell at the same time but nobody is there to provide money then the value of bitcoins will fall fast. This event would then be referenced again and again preventing public from trusting similar currencies in the future.

In the great depression you could taste what the world would be like if there was no civilization. You would wander around in the streets, catch pneumonia and die. If you like being in a warm room during winter not dying then pay your taxes. The *privilege* of government has to be paid.

@_date: 2011-05-17 22:59:12
I felt like many people were pro-bitcoin just because bitcoins are inherently better adapted to the needs of people who want to commit tax evasion.  I'm pointing out that paying taxes is a good thing as it is the only thing that is holding society from descending into chaos that would likely resemble medieval Europe. For all the bad things that governments do they also provide a valuable services and if there is any blame to be laid for the crimes committed then they should be pointing fingers at actual governments and not the system of government currently employed by the western civilization. But it takes a lot more to point at your government than to rant on the internet about how governments should be abolished. I bet actual governments even like that - instead of having to provide answers to some questions they laugh at lunatics wanting to abolish governments who everyone ignores.

Congrats for being a fucking retarded hippie. "Oh it's a conspiracy, oh taxation allows higher classes to leech on the poor proletariat's blood". If there wasn't any taxation then there wouldn't be any government. And for a few months we would live in a happy hippie anarchist society, but after that it would be a medieval europe all over again with major war every 10 years. FFS. Tax evasion is stealing from the society. Fucking scum like you. 
@_date: 2011-05-17 22:43:32
There's nothing holding anarchy, as hippies like to imagine it to be, to be spoiled by warlords. Anarchy can't exist, any political science student will tell you this. And what you get after you dismantle current government is chaos many times bigger than chaos represented by the existing system. There is nothing stopping medieval europe happening all over again if democracies fall. 
@_date: 2011-05-17 23:04:29
There hasn't been any major war in 65 years. There also hasn't been any war between two democracies. There is only one failure and that is America, but you, Americans are individually responsible for voting in asshats into office. The actual governments are to blame, not the system of government.

I never understood why people were pumping so much money into bitcoin. I mean to me that deflation and after top % start selling their share en masse the resulting inflation would rapidly take bitcoin value to hell, to me it seem the only rational outcome. But then - then, why would people pay for it if they knew it would crash. Why??  
My little conspiracy theory that I invented tells me that governments are pumping value purposefully into it. I imagine they would much rather see it crash on its own than ban it. If they banned it then bitcoin would become a hard to control underground thing, but if they crashed it then people world-wide would lose all confidence in any similar future currency experiments. I think one of governments set aside few million dollars just to crash the project in its entirety.

Who the fuck do you think protects you from war lords. It's a government with their law enforcement. Imagine government in US fell and you lived in let's say Texas. Here's how one day a conversation would go between a warlord of Texas and you:
Warlord: Hello, fellow citizen. Do you see that Texas is in great peril from the barbarians up north? Will you join our just cause to defend our island of civilization? 
You: I won't serve you. I won't recognize any form of government because I want to live in autonomous anarchistic commune.
Warlord: Too bad, kill that traitorous vermin before he infects others.
This is the way things would go, because this is the way things went.

And that rule was instituted for somewhat good reasons - users don't want to fiddle with a myriad of different payment options and even less to enter credit card numbers into apps that they don't fully trust. Second reason is maybe that 30%, but irc Apple doesn't make that much off of it in comparison to hardware sales. Unless we want to believe in conspiracies of Apple working with the man, it's more likely that Apple is interpreting their policy too literary - they didn't see that Coinbase doesn't use foreign currency for in-app purchases as it's merely a tool for working with a foreign service. Or Apple is intentionally strict so that they don't crate any precedent that other app makers would try to later (ab)use (SkyDrive disagreement was probably only about that).

They are idiots for other reasons. Mainly for accepting the situation and not demanding the freedom of choice that you get on PC. 


That's why you have licenses where you put your waivers of liability. And just for good measure phone makers should put big flashy screens asking users if they are really really really sure if they want to root their phone.


It's technically very easy to make phones that are unbreakable (all you have to do is have little eeprom that streams new boot loader over USB, basically what PCs have with BIOS). And it should be easy to save on flash memory when an user chose to root his phone so you can charge him for formatting and reinstalling OS if he comes back with a broken rooted phone. 
I suspect walled garden OSes are there for other reasons - various proprietary shells/apps that phone makers bundle to 'brand' their phones (Samsung mostly), cargo cult moronity (all other Android phone makers), subsidies and misguided aspirations (probably Microsoft, as they don't want you to install Android on their phones) and app quality (Apple, iOS apps are generally better than apps on other platforms unless they are made by fortune 500 companies).

My theory is that NSA was onto him for a long time and they waited until the blackmail thing happened. See, while many see NSA as this evil agency that wants to take our privacy without any moral qualms, it's probably more likely that they are not as monolithic and they themselves actuality believe that they are there to protect the public. While they were reasonably OK with SK (drugs don't harm people that much and it was higher quality that on the street and for everything else they could keep tabs on people), but as soon as an actual attempted murder got involved they couldn't ignore it as if it got out (again, not monolithic, remember snowden) there would be blowback if they just sat on it.

Except an updated version of your OS because they never bothered with new updates a few months after they shipped it and the only way around it is to use an exploit to reinstall the community version of a FOSS OS. And the proof that you need an updated OS is that same exploit hole that manufacturer chose to ignore. Fuck every phone maker.
