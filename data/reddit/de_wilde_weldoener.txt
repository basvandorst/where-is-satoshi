The first season of Hidden Secrets of Money is the best damn education you can get on monetary systems anywhere, to me it even beats the Austrian economics view.  
This series strongly distinguishes between money and currency, and defines both clearly.  
Once you learn to make that distinction and see it's implications for a monetary system so many things become clear.
I stumbled upon this series in 2014 and it put me on a path that changed my life and entire view of the world.  
I discovered the concept of sound money, the value of free markets, the Austrian school of economics, and adopted voluntarism.
Now the reason that predictions about WHEN the next big crisis is coming are always early, is because the powers that be keep thinking up new insane ways of kicking the can down the road a little further.  
10 years ago negative interest rates we're an absurd concept.  
I mean, it's an absurd concept now too, but now they're doing it ;)  
15 years ago massive central bank currency creation (QE) was a similar concept, but that has been going on for nearly a decade now too.  
The crisis and shift in monetary system is coming, the current system won't last forever, they are kicking the can down the road, uphill, and it's getting steeper.  
This won't last forever, it can't, but don't ask anyone "when".

Practice setting up a wallet, verifying your backup, wiping the thing, and restoring it.
Practice until you remember the steps and don't need the manual.
Practice until you fully understand what you are doing and are comfortable doing it.
Keep your seed phrase safe, never type it on a keyboard, don't break cold storage.
Use a passphrase, keep it safe.
Don't tell people you have a hardware wallet, hardware wallet = he must be rich let's rob him.

Updating to new firmware does not wipe my seed, are you sure the device is wiped when installing improperly signed firmware?
@_date: 2019-10-05 14:40:31
I'm not entirely sure what you mean.
Trezor One runs a bootloader, which loads the firmware.  
Trezor-T runs a boardloader, that loads the bootloader, and that loads the firmware.
I'm not sure which one of those has read access to the part of the memory where the private key is stored.  
There's a lot of good technical info on the Trezor wiki though, you could check there.

A cold wallet can get hot, by being exposed to an online device.  
A hot wallet can never become cold again because you can never undo the above.

I think 10,5 million would be a more aesthetically pleasing number, because it's 1,05 quadrillion Satoshi's.  
In end though I don't think it matters as long as the final supply is known, and the emission schema is fixed.  
I was drawn to bitcoin because of the limit, not because the limit was 21 million or 21 trillion.

TLDR   
A pin protects against hardware wallet theft.   
A passphrase protects against seed phrase theft.   
A private key can be generated from a seed phrase, or from a seed phrase + optional passphrase, the latter is more secure. Multiple private keys can be generated from the same seed phrase by using different passphrases, every key can hold its own coins.
If a wallet uses a seed phrase without a passphrase then having only the seed phrase is enough to generate the same private key and control the coins. If a wallet uses a seed phrase + passphrase then having only the seed phrase can not generate the same private key, you can however generate a different private key that does not control the coins, you need both to generate the same private key and control the coins.
The pin on your Trezor (and other hardware wallets) protects the encrypted on-device storage of the seed phrase, the pin does not protect you if someone has the unencrypted seed phrase on paper for example. The optional passphrase is not stored on the device, that is why you have to enter it every time you want to use the wallet, so the device can generate the corresponding private key and control the coins.

I enjoyed Thieves Emporium.It's a fictional near-future story about an encroaching police state/dictatorship where using the dark web is the only way to conduct free trade.  
People use gold coins as a payment mechanism.  
It was a cool story but throughout the whole thing I just kept thinking "aw man they should just use bitcoin".

 Reflashing the Trezor with malicious firmware
Official Trezor firmware is signed by the SatoshiLabs master key. Installing unofficial firmware on the Trezor is possible, but doing so will wipe the device storage, and Trezor will show a warning every time it starts.
To be extra careful, make sure that the Trezor package is unopened, and the tamper-evident holograms are undamaged and in place. See also [Tamper-evident hologram]( and [Trezor packaging timeline](  
=======  
If I'm reading it right, the device itself wipes itself (and the seed) if detecting an improperly signed firmware.
There's nothing connecting your seed to Satoshilabs.

A seed phrase is based on BIP 39 and is a standard: [
Wallets don't implement their own word list, the list itself is part of the standard.
A seed phrase can be imported by any wallet that supports BIP 39.
A seed phrase will not become obsolete or require an old wallet to import for the foreseeable future.

I consider paper wallets to be made obsolete by the vastly superior hardware wallet.   
For the vast majority of users, offline key generation and storage is done with ease and very securely using a hardware wallet, whereas doing the same with creating a paper wallet is a challenge.
The paper wallet also offers less security than the hardware wallet.  
They are harder to safely make offline copies of, writing down a private key is error prone, and your printer/scanner is NOT secure.   
If you want to spend/move the balance of a paper wallet you will have to sweep it into a hot wallet, because no hardware wallet I know of support sweeping.  
Doing this means you have broken cold storage which was the entire reason for using a paper wallet in the first place.
Using a hardware wallet solves all these problems.  
A seed phrase can be easily copied offline by writing down the words, words themselves have error correction, you know when you've misspelled one.   
Moving/spending the balance is done while keeping the private key offline at all times.
The only advantage I see in paper wallets is that they are practically free.

Dude seriously.
You are the second person ~~on the internet~~ in the world who I've ever seen bring up money vs currency.
The first for me was Mike Maloney in Hidden Secrets of Money, where I learned the difference.
It's not &lt;50% of people that understand, I dare say it's less than one in a million.
The only other people I know of that understand are those I explained it to myself, sadly most of those barely cared.

When you want security, the free option is rarely a good one.

When the internet in Turkey was getting more and more censored, normal everyday people who had never heard of DNS, learned how to change theirs to the Google DNS [8.8.8.8](
The address was spraypainted on walls.
Bitcoin will have it's time of necessity where normal everyday people will learn how to use it, it's important to realize that for most of the first world, this time has not yet come.
Unless you are Cypriot or Greek.

Try switching block explorer in the settings.
Force quit the app.
Reboot your phone.
Same thing happened to me a couple times, Mycelium was showing a zero balance until I tried some or all of the above.
That statement in the changelog is about accounts on which you won't be able to **generate** SegWit addresses after the update until you re-import the account I believe, it is not the issue you are now experiencing.

Your wallet needs Bitcoin on a SegWit address (3... or bc1...) to be able to open a Lightning payment channel.  
Not every address in a wallet has to be a SegWit address, but only the SegWit address can be used to open payment channels.  
% SegWit adoption doesn't mean much for Lightning adoption, every Lightning wallet is already using SegWit.  
What was important for Lightning adoption was nodes upgrading to a SegWit enabled version so channel open/close transactions could be processed.  
Pretty every node has long since upgraded.

In a hardware wallet I don't want to compromise on security for convenience.  
For me, bluetooth is a convenience I don't need, and an attack vector I don't want.  
Same goes for a battery.
I use a KeepKey, it has no battery, is USB powered, and has no wireless connection.  
When unplugged it is off, a brick, this makes me feel safe.

The secure enclave not having been hacked yet is not the point.  
I did not state the smartphone is unable to secure your private key, I simply stated that the hardware wallet is by far the more secure device to do so.  
I see no reason why I would store a private key for the bulk of my Bitcoin on anything less secure than the most secure class of device, a hardware wallet.  
A smartphone is surely more convenient, but convenience is not first priority in storing your savings, security is.

I don't have advice for what to set your fee's at, but I have mine set on the default, I'm using LND. I found the below info on the default fee settings, I think you can assume most people leave it at the default, or go lower to compete for routing "customers". These options can be added to your lnd.conf file if you're using LND, I don't know about other Lightning implementations.
\--bitcoin.minhtlc=1000  
The smallest HTLC we are willing to forward on our channels, in **millisatoshi** (default: 1000)
\--bitcoin.basefee=1000  
The base fee in **millisatoshi** we will charge for forwarding payments on our channels (default: 1000)
\--bitcoin.feerate=1  
The fee rate used when forwarding payments on our channels. The total fee charged is basefee + (amount \* feerate / 1000000), where amount is the forwarded amount. (default: 1)
\--bitcoin.timelockdelta=144  
The CLTV delta we will subtract from a forwarded HTLC's timelock value (default: 144)

The fallacy here is the implied but unstated argument that on chain scaling would do better, but let's do some back of a napkin math for on-chain scaling.  
7.5 billion people, doing 20 transactions a day, at 300 kilobyte per transactions, distributed across 144 blocks a day.  
That would require a 312 TERABYTE block, every 10 minutes, this is not even counting all the network chatter that happens besides shuffling around blocks.  
Safe to say that is not happening any time soon, I don't think that kind of bandwidth will be available in 38 years either.  
Even assuming it's true it would take 38 years to onboard 7.5 billion people to lightning, that is still a better solution than one that is technically absurd like having 312 terabyte blocks.

You don't own any bitcoin because ownership is a legal fiction.  
Control however is real, when you are the only one who knows a private key, you are the only one who can exert control over the associated bitcoin.

I use Bitcoin Ticket Widget (Android) to get notifications about price moves.

Bitcoin is terribly unfit for replacing fiat currencies because it can't be used to steal citizens' purchasing power through inflation.

You can't be sure the bluetooth is off, unless you physically cut the connections, if you don't want to take my word for it listen to John McAfee talk about device security.  
And with a battery, you can't be sure the device itself is off, unless you remove the battery.
Wireless connections make a device less secure, because you can't see if someone on the other side of the wall is trying to connect to it.  
You might even be giving away the fact you HAVE a hardware wallet by having bluetooth be on.  
Batteries make a device less secure, because being unpowered is always more secure than being powered.
If you don't think these are serious issues to be avoided then you are not paranoid enough about crypto security.
My hardware wallet has no wireless connection and no battery, when it is unconnected it is off, a brick, you can't hack a brick remotely.

A smartphone is designed to be connected to as many networks as possible 24/7.  
A hardware wallet is designed to be barely ever connected, it has no battery and does not even run code when not plugged in.
A smartphone can connect through USB, audio jack, a SIM card slot, an SD card slot, multiple types of WIFI, multiple types of cellular, radio, NFC, and probably some stuff I didn't think of.  
A hardware wallet can connect through USB.
A smartphone is designed to run millions of pieces of software in the form of auto-updating closed-source apps, a sometimes closed-source OS, and maybe even a closed-source kernel.  
A hardware wallet in most cases doesn't even run an OS, but just bare metal open source code.
A smartphone is designed to do a thousand things and always be online.  
A hardware wallet is designed to do one thing, securely store a private key offline.
Of these two devices it is obviously the hardware wallet that offers the best security for your private key.

I use this one on Android: [ can set up price notifcations on x% change or on certain prices levels, not on set times though.You can set up a widget on the homescreen that displays the price.It has ads but they only display in the main view unobstructively.
At some point in 2017 I was checking the price every 10 minutes like you and it drove me crazy.This app notifies me if the price has a change I deem significant, it has given me some peace of mind and I've stopped checking as much.
