Bitcoin : the crypto currency this subreddit is all about 
Bitcoin Core : the main wallet &amp; daemon of the Bitcoin currency. 
It is not some other scam coin. I’m asking a question and solution for a problem that I’m having while trying to set up a bitcoin node.

Also when you look upper half of screen, it looks like it is moving towards up, when you look down you see it's actually moving downwards. Maybe it's better if you adjust the top part. Maybe make the blocks not disappear in one time, but some type of gradient effect.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:42:21
setting up this value to 550 will store around 700-800 blocks, which is around 5 days of time. I need more blocks stored on the device so that I can check transactions more than 5 days. So, there is a point setting it more than 550

Please stop assuming everyone’s project requirements are same with yours. I need at least last 2 months of block data including all transactions. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:31:20
It is all about how the miner is operating their pool and how they add transactions into blocks they mined.
Almost in all cases miners will include the first seen transaction in their block, making second TX disappear from mempool once first one gets confirmed. However, some pool operator might decide to include the second one because of the higher fee and simply don't see the first one.

There is a problem with your statement. Not to be the guy who shits about Bitcoin but currently we have block time average 10 min, which means you can double spend in that 10 minute and "not pay" for something you already got. I don't see getting in a line, buying groceries and paying bitcoin because of that problem.
Tho lightning and all could solve this issue and we could be easily spending Bitcoins. But also when you think about it, there will be only 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis. If you think in 3-5 years human population will be 10,000,000,000 there will be only 210K satoshis per person. (assuming distributed evenly). If you also think about whales and lost coins and dead wallets, this number will go down to 150K satoshis per person. 
So now, imagine all your wealth is costing 150K satoshis, would you be okay with paying 1 satoshi for your grocery? or paying 5-6 satoshi fee for transaction?
We gotta be realistic. Bitcoin came as a "digital currency for value exchange" but now it became an asset to store wealth instead of being a payment way. There are way more better coins to make payment, faster and even anonym.

I got it with "sudo apt-get install bitcoind" (after adding the repository). I didn't compile myself. 
I have tried prune=1 as some documents said this will allow pruning via RPC calls and I wasn't successful on that either. Now with Qt installed, it seems that prune=15000 works. I will wait a bit more to see if it'll stay at that disk usage level or keep increasing again.

As I stated in the story, I have been following Bitcoin since 2011 and started believing in the project later. I have used Bitcoin in "real life" by getting paid with "Bitcoin" and now working on Blockchain/Cryptocoin projects both as a developer and a writer. I didn't wanna make a story of "pyramid scam" but to show "how decentralized and non-backed by governments project can gain value with the support of people". If you call "support of people in a project" a pyramid scam, that means everything, including "stock market" is a pyramid scam.

Suspected and possible scam. Domain registered a month ago, no proper advertising, no proper design, yet claims to have +10K trades. Stay away.
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:59:20
You can tell them you want to buy Bitcoin from them and offer high price. Ask them to send you the coins and tell them you'll release bitcoins once you secure the payment. 
Other than that, I don't see a way. Also I have wrote a detailed security / abuse report to the namecheap. I hope they will take the legal actions and this guy will face problems. And I don't know how this person can be that stupid to publicly give all the data about his website.
Seriously, if someone would got scammed for like 20-30K USD and took this case to legal authorities, he would get fucked easily. Stupid scammers, if you are going to scam, at least do it properly :D
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:04:43
BTW, how did you hear about this website?
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:33:54
I have made a little more search about the website and found some interesting details,
On the About Us page, they claim to have moved the website from TraderBond.org to TraderBond.com at 5th of March 2018. However, the DNS records for the domain TraderBond.com shows that domain got registerd at 31 July 2018.
There are no posts / info about the website on any other place on the internet, no ads, no one talking about it, yet it claims +10K trades.
The website is using NameCheap's hosting service. When I checked the date, it is clearly shown that this website started being hosted on NameCheap at 2nd of August 2018. So, it didn't move from another domain to this address, and it didn't founded at 2014 as they claim.
Such service would require their own server with enough processing power + bandwith. However, they are hosted at a server with 266 other websites, which shows, this website is just a basic HTML/PHP design to scam people's crypto currencies.
After all these info and research, I am 100% sure this website is a scam.

@_date: 2017-11-10 21:34:30
I live in a middle east country where transferring money via online or mobile banking is free in the same bank and costs only a dollar for transferring money to other national banks. Also the transactions happens in the next second for internal transactions 24/7 and to the other national banks in working hours transactions also takes seconds.
What does BTC offer other than being "international" right now? Anonym? Hell no, once you share your BTC wallet everyone can see the balance, transaction times etc. 
This transaction fees + times problem should be solved immediately, too many transactions are waiting while Ethereum is handling more transactions than bitcoin and offering 30 seconds transaction time average.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:02:52
It is not about "scaling debate", what I am saying is we should not just close our eyes to the reality and act like nothing bad is going on. This is a serious issue about Bitcoin yet people are just saying "oh, price dropped" "oh, we are going to the moon" "oh, we should HODL"

Hi, thank you for the comment. However it seems that you are not familiar with the crypto mining concept. Actually there are answers on the document for all the questions you have asked. Please first read how hashes are generated or how “if input bit changes, output hash changes” thing works.

Not trying to be the dick here but who would be okay with waiting 10 min to just pay for a meal?
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:29:25
I didn’t borrow any information or data from the p2pool, why would I mention them? I didn’t even check how they work in detail. 
Pond mining protocol is an extra layer where the user doesn’t have to download any extra data and where floating ponds with maximum miner count will be lowering the dust transactions. P2pool has no valid solution for dust transactions. At least not that I know of. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:39:48
Thanks a lot for suggestions! As I have written on the paper, this is just a concept proposal and there is no active code working at the moment. I have knowledge about how P2Pool works but this pond mining kinda works different allowing better scalability and having less dust payments. 
What is a pond and how do member validate shares are actually explained on the paper. Since each miner run a node themselves, they can validate the submitted share by checking the share itself. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:54:54
The main difference is this solution doesn't use any side chain and has better scalability and allows anyone with any hashrate to contribute on the mining. Also it allows pond hopping as such decentralized solution would not make any significant profit to the pond hoppers.
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:59:23
So you say like "Hey guys, I stopped using the blockchain itself and I started trusting some third party pool/explorer operators and their mempool info".
What is the reason of having a blockchain and block verification then? We could put all transactions in mempool for a day, then just include them all into one big block. 
Sorry to say but this just shows how "centralized" BTC became.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:43:06
Still no confirmation. Every 2-3 days, the TX gets broadcasted again and still no confirmation.

@_date: 2017-10-14 22:58:08
BTC will only backed by fiat. I am not seeing a future where 1 bottle of water will be 1BTC always. BTC has limited supply, it requires hashing power (hardware + electricty) to create new coins, which becomes harder every day. So, there will be fewer BTC produced in future and there will be more transactions.
You tell, if there is limited amount of something and the amount of people who wants to have some of this something is increasing every day, what would happen? The price of that SOMETHING would increase, which is what happening to BTC right now.
For other coins, which has unlimited supply, maybe one day we won't need fiat and everything will be stabilized, but for BTC, it's backed by fiat.
Also this is true for currencies, they are backed by Gold, which is a limited element in the nature and money is dependant on it. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:48:10
Most probably there will be no direct BTC loaning because it would be way worse than loaning from the bank for the guy who loans.
I have two ideas, 
1) There can be a new coin, lets say 1NEWC = 1USD or another currency where there is low inflation. And lets say 1 BTC = 5K USD, when you lend 1BTC, you actually lend 5000NEWC instead of 1BTC and when 1BTC becomes 20K, you still owe 5000NEWC to the loaner, and which is equal to 5000USD all the time. This method needs a new currency.
2) All lending could be converted to some other currency like USD or EUR. At the time you loan, you will have a payment plan in USD or EUR. Lets say you loaned 1BTC which is equal to 5K at that moment. You will have a payment plan which is 500 USD per month, so you'll payback in 10 months. If BTC price rises, you will pay less BTC every month, (equal to 500USD) and if it drops, you will pay more BTC (still equal to 500USD).
Otherwise if you lend 1BTC and need to payback as it is, there will be no meaning lending that money from crypo instead of banks. 
Even, if the system will be like "Lend 1BTC, pay 1BTC", people could go lend some money from bank, buy 100BTC equals to 500K USD at the time, then lend it to some people, get 1BTC every month (lets say) and pay their loan back and still make profit with return since BTC gained value. This will cause people to make money out of air, just by loaning from banks and buying crypto and lending it to others.
So I think this method won't work.

You can have Electrum wallet installed on your computer and you can import/export private keys. It supported BCH and I am sure it will also support new BCGold. 
To me, for BCC I have used Electrum wallet, the other alts like Monero, Ethereum, Zcash, Dash etc. I use shapeshift service to transfer them to BTC and then I cashout BTC from a local trading website. (Since I'm not able to cashout from Kraken/Poloniex/Cex.io/GDAX etc.)

you're right and wrong at the same time. Yes, it is a decentralized currency. No, it will lose its purpose if the price goes up and if we have a TX cap per block. 
Think about it, 21M BTC is the only currency in the world. 0.002625 BTC per person if distributed equally. Assuming the world ain't a fair place, an average human would have around 0.00002625 BTC.
Now your entire wealth is 0.00002625 BTC, but,  you must pay  0.00011436 BTC as a fee for your transaction to be included on the next block?? Or, just think about it, only 1K transactions could happen per 10 minutes, how will an average person transfer money?? 
Such problems actually limits our product's use cases, it limits us in terms of adoption, as people tend to stay away from BTC transactions when the fees are high, and stops using it, and if you can't move your wealth, it actually means you don't have anything. Just like, you have a pile of gold, that is buried 10 kilometers deep. You have it, you know it, you know it's there, but in order to get it, you must spend two piles of gold on the equipment. Now, would you do it? OR, would you be able to buy something with the gold you have there? I think not.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:30:50
Please do not get me wrong but this doesn't mean "we are still super early". This means, people living in your country (I am assuming it is US) do not know (or do not care) about the Bitcoin as they either don't understand the importance of the money or again, do not care about it. 
Look at the countries with high inflation rates, or trade bans. Majority of the people living in such countries have at least heard about the crypto, many also know the price if not exactly but like "so it hit 8K again huh?". I am from Turkey and almost everyone around me, including people age over 40 with no technological knowledge knows that a BTC is worth a lot, and it is a digital money. Are they trusting the Bitcoin? Possibly not. Do they know that there is such thing and it is being used? Definitely yes.
Revolutions doesn't start at a place where everything is okay. Currently the US Dollar is strong worldwide. An American who is working and making money in US can simply take a plane to go wherever they want and can spend their money without any problem. Everyone is ready to accept dollar. Whereas, a Turkish citizen must convert the money to US Dollar or Euros if they want to spend it in some other country. People who are facing with problems in their lives because of money are actually looking for alternatives, and that's why BTC price is higher in underdeveloped countries, compared to western civilizations.
Do not expect such revolution to begin in a country where everyone is already kinda okay with the financial situation, making enough money and actually not caring about what is going on this world. The criminals (drug dealers, serial killers, deep web freaks) were the first ones to use, and first reason why many learned about the Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in general. Other e-commerce websites didn't need such payment method, because what they have were enough for them.
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:41:17
I believe you are not familiar with how they work as I have been developing apps on blockchain for a while now. 
TX fees are determined by user, and miners choose the highest paying fees (fee per kb) to make the most income out of a block. Assuming a world where only 1K TX is allowed per 10 min, this results in 10 TX per 6 seconds. 
Considering such little TX being allowed for that time span, the fees per TX will increase to a point where an average person won’t be able to transfer their money because when an average person wants to buy ice cream, they can pay a fee, say, at most 5% of the product’s cost, so that the payment method is efficient. 
Now, there will always be some wealthy people willing to buy expensive stuff, such as houses or yatchs or expensive cars or hotel trips, or transfers between banks etc. When a rich person wants to buy 1M USD apartment, they’ll be okay with 50K USD fee, so that’ll be their TX fee in terms of BTC. And do you really think an average person on the earth has 50K USD wealth? So, the rich’s 5% for their expensive buy will be much larger than your total wealth. And how will you pay for the ice cream?
Yes, 1M USD apartment payments won’t be that often, BUT, we have a lot of stock markets, daily corporate transactions, transfers for loans and other payments. Such transaction count will lead to a state where average TX fee will be really high. And you won’t be able to move even a penny from your wallet. 
In a simpler way, your desired fee must be high enough so that your TX is included in the next block. High enough that it is one of the top 1000 most expensive transactions for the following 10 minutes.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:26:23
I totally agree. This is like some soldier going to war, dying, but allies capturing the city and some other people saying "meh, allies captured to city, he didn't have to die". It is like what the heck, if he didn't fight for it, allies wouldn't be capturing the city. 
Pizza guy was the first person who would trade BTC for something in real life. He even said "open offer", he was ready to pay 10K BTC for 2 pizzas, anytime anyone wanted. 
I love you Pizza guy!

Solving the problem while being not decentralized? 
It is like, I advertise you a digital cash, and I say “hey, banks also have digital money transfer solutions, but they are centralized and could be traceable, come, use bitcoin, it is decentralized!!”
Even though there are faster, better digital cash solutions, you buy Bitcoin, because it is decentralized cash. Later it loses its being digital cash feature, so you’re like “bro I switched to this because I wanted a better currency, but now I can’t spend it!!”
And I come up with a solution, lightning network, that is centralized, and I tell you “hey, it is digital cash and fast again!! But not decentralized”
Then where is the meaning of using Bitcoin at the first place? Why would I choose to trust some random person over registered companies that are paying taxes? Product is the same, why would I choose LN over Banks? 
Just a little addition mainly for people from US to understand how banking solutions are good in other countries; 
I can transfer money from my bank A to some other person’s account at the same bank A (same company, doesn’t matter which branch/city the accounts are registered) in the same second. Like, I type address, amount, hit the send and money is at that someone else’s account at the same instant. And it costs nothing. Literally free. 
I can transfer money from my bank A to some other bank B, the transaction will be executed at daytime, between 09.00 AM and 05.30 PM, and again it takes at most 30 secs, and completely free. 
I am allowed to keep USD/EUR/GBP/JPY and whatever currency I want and as much as I want. I can open multiple accounts and foreign currency accounts with just couple clicks in seconds and exchange between currencies easily. 
Also you know how banks provide credit cards and can confirm transactions under 20 seconds no matter what time it is, and AMEX/VISA/Mastercard already have reliable products. 
So now, I have such product already, why do I need another centralized, possibly more expensive currency?
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:37:48
Believe or not, when BTC first came out and started being traded on exchanges, it was a really good way to launder money. And transfer money globally, without answering any question.
