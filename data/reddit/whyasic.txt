Thanks for your reply. I noticed most of your comments are negative and bitter though. I hope this is not going to happen! Cheers mate
@_date: 2013-02-02 00:09:56
Yeah, you're right, your code is shorter and more concise, but PHP can sometimes be tricky with numbers. When dealing with prices and real money it's better to avoid mixing string and numbers. That's why i mentioned float_val. Anyhow, your example could be extended further and it retains its value. The cache point of stock_blocker is obviously something that need to be addressed if you're polling frequently. This is not an issue if we are talking about a cronjob that runs every 10 minutes or so.

eek, you are confusing probably with the cost of setting up an hard mask or etching a wafer batch. Anyways there are a lot of opensource FPGA Bitcoin miner implementation that could be modified, i am sure i could* get this job on oDesk for much less, but i'd like to make Bitcoin circulate in our economy rather than using dirty FIAT. Someone with enough skills and free time could join in, i still have hopes, i'll give it some time then i'll search for other routes. Thanks for your feedback mate, it's appreciated.

Thank you very much for the head up!

Hi there,thanks for your comment, i don't think they're going to offer licensing. Also checkout

Good catch, spent long time thinking about this. I tried several months ago to find freelance contractors for this work, but i didn't find any good candidate at that time. I think Intel or Samsung do not deal with the public in the manner i need, but i will research on this matter. Indeed i am aiming for something like 65nm, or possibly better, in the realm of reality, time and cost wise.
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:12:00
really ? any source ? this is funny, but true. i've explored this option briefly before, i'm sure some more commitment would have took me farther.
@_date: 2013-05-12 04:05:28
Thanks for your great input, much appreciated. Will enquiry an IP lawyer about this as a next step. Thank you very much for your support also. Cheers mate. have an upvote
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:57:49
Definitely, risk management is necessary in any kind of venture. simulating all possible scenarios and  according solutions/actions is a fundamental good engineering practice.
@_date: 2013-05-12 02:21:32
Cool, is there a chance we might work together then ? what's your background ? if you care to share here, or send me a private message.
There are techniques to design an ASIC using a set of prefabricated simpler integrated circuits, did you look into them ? 
**EDIT** As said, i want to invest several resources, including financial, and raise additional funds through proper channels and connections. VC funding obstacle can be overcome, as per the team, one of this post goal  is gather interest from properly skilled people. I would offer a salary if i have guarantees of delivery.
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:09:08
Thank you for this precious feedback. Please see 
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:41:08


What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-02-01 22:50:22
from php just use  file_get_contents or better yet curl to grab that  url output. PHP example pseudo code for the first option follows.
1) $priceOfYourItemUSD = 10;
2) $oneUSDbtcValue = file_get_contents("
3) $priceOfyourItemBTC = float_val($oneUSDbtcValue * $priceOfYourItemUSD);
EDIT  : i can't seem to get reddit formatting to work, i do apologize. EDIT2 : Ok it's better now. I hope it's of any help. feel free to ask more questions.
@_date: 2013-05-13 00:08:40
You can derive pinouts and all informations from a working VHDL implementation and adapt them to their design. It's not a simple task indeed. Requires some simulations and trial and error.
@_date: 2013-01-25 13:39:18
i have included a fee, the transaction isn't showing anywhere. I would like to know what to do in case there's a problem.
@_date: 2013-05-12 02:23:38
Hi, Jeff! thanks for your comment. Do you happen to have the knowledge or interest into working on this design ? 
I would love to work with you. Cheers
**EDIT** Further elaborating on your comment, i know, from previous researches that there are already IP cores available, but they need be modified and adapted to bitcoin mining. Thus i'm not sure, if time-wise, this is still the best option. My offer is anyway still valid, but i doubt you have the time to dedicate to this project. Hope to be wrong!
@_date: 2013-05-12 01:36:59
Not sure if it would be time-effective too, and that's the troublesome variable. Thank you for your input Todamont, appreciated. I'll setup a bitcoin tip account one of these days. Care to elaborate more on why you do think going from scratch would be a better option, cost wise?
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:13:01
I see. Anyways, thank you very much for your insights, they are much appreciated. Contact me if you ever change your mind, i would love to get you involved in this venture, you could be consulting for us. Cheers!

BTC blackbird ‏
 Any estimation on ETA?
Blockchain.info ‏
 Wallets updated since 4:00 AM need to be restored from Amazon AWS backups. I am writing a tool to do this now. **~1-4 hours.**
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:19:15
Yes, i have seen it and honestly i doubt it's a legit venture. But i may be proven wrong. Anyways, i'm interested in my own, private development, and in a long term advance of the ASIC technology, rather than making a business out of selling devices to the public now, that might come at later stages, when smaller die size goal is reached.
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:44:30
hi! thanks for your feedback. Are you a lawyer ?
@_date: 2013-05-12 01:42:31
Thank you for your response, it brings very bad news indeed. Do you have any reliable sources about the Taiwanese people cloning already Avalon ASIC, or could you describe why and how you do happen to know this somehow ? Cheers 
 
@_date: 2013-03-01 03:03:59
I think Nintendo cartridges were merely a memory support for a software, but i might be wrong.
@_date: 2013-01-14 00:38:53
site works fine for me. I mean that it loads fine, i am not a customer
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:26:19
while i have some experience and theoretical knowledge of the field, i would go for a safer route and employ people with more practical experience to execute this process in a timely manner.
@_date: 2013-01-29 01:05:25
It's consistent with what has been described previously on the relevant bitcointalk thread. I do believe this is what we will see in action very soon. Avalon promised full shipment of the first batch within February.
@_date: 2013-05-12 02:48:00
a scrypt ASIC would require entirely different design, different algo and huge memory needs, which will make offchips memory necessary in the design of an ASIC or FPGA, thus making it more expensive and complex to yeld a final working design because, as said, of the totally different engineering needed. I'm mostly interested into Bitcoin ASIC. Thanks for your comment, it's still a good input for differently oriented ventures i guess. Cheers
@_date: 2013-01-29 00:56:39
it is hilarious that what happened with this site is comparable to the Tulip mania effect. Only maybe the final outcome is different. The psychological exploits on people are the same, and they are shown to be working. Beware this kind of schemes is the message.
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:16:50
Well, as said, i do not intend to sell any device, this is a private mining venture. In the USA it is legal to reverse engineer something, if it's for research purpose, so chipworks shouldn't have any issue. The final goal, as stated, is to advance the technology, so that could be considered research. Thank you for your input. Interesting twist but i have gave a thought or two to the issue already. What do you think of my solution ?
@_date: 2013-05-12 02:05:42
Correct, i am sure the Avalon ASIC, though still in its infancy, employs this kind of optimizations and i can't wait to see a SEM imagery of the inner circuits.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:04:59
Uhm, but i was giving away a 0.1 btc tip, not a 100 USD one. What's the correlation ? apparently your dinner cost might match the tip i've offered, but i still do not get the correlation with your rant. Cheers
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:41:36
Thank you for the info!
@_date: 2013-03-23 02:37:55
mine was solved today.
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:29:16
Hi Yifu! Thanks for your feedback here. Really appreciated. I will look carefully all options in the next few days! Go Avalon! Cheers mate
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:37:23
Point taken, i just meant that scrypt memory requirements 'per design' are larger than those of Bitcoin, agree? 
@_date: 2013-05-13 00:12:06
I am offering 60 BTC for a VHDL design, which would be compatible with the AVALON released specifications.
I do not think this is extremely low, since i could get the job outsourced in other markets but for a much cheaper final cost. 
Do not forget that the hard costs of going from a VHDL design to a real chip is getting the masks and actually get the foundry to build your chips, not the VHDL programming. 
What i am asking is a revisiting of existing FPGA designs, suitable for an initial process of 110 nm
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:11:50
deeper-blue nailed it definitely. I could use an existing FPGA VHDL design and there are even techniques to re-use common chip parts  which would made the process much more cheaper
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:38:43
excellent and best candidate for now. An address where i can send the tip ? i'm not using the tip bot yet. Shame on me. I'll do soon
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:10:23
Thanks for the informations, yes i do know Avalon is based on a evolution of that design. I don't want to dig to deep into details about copyright and IP issues here, i'll hire a lawyer to take care of the legal and burocratic stuffs. Regarding what you mention in the edit, you are right in part, anyway the goal of this specifically was trying to reuse as much as possible the Avalon control board design to keep cost at a minimum. What do you suggest ? 
**EDIT** I'm also expecting avalon to release some more specifications soon. Some of the informations needed would be also obtainable from a live analysis of the module at work, using proper tooling to extract the bitstream and other signals.
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:16:54
Hey, yes, i mentioned chipworks in the OP! you're right about SHA256 indeed!
@_date: 2013-03-15 11:24:39
Thanks. Doesn't look promising.
@_date: 2013-05-12 01:29:27
Thanks for your feedback. They are not standard SHA256 cores, bitcoin mining requires a double nested round of SHA256 for the word message, there are some design optimizations in the chip for sure, like better pipelining and definitely a working design of a custom, not standard implementation of a SHA256 core. While it may turn easy to just reproduce them without much troubles because of their supposed simplicity, i believe the correct term to use in this context is still "reverse engineer" them.
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:06:52
Since i received several critics regarding the size of the tip/bounty, i have modified the amount a bit. 
It is now **100 BTC**.
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:55:34
Sent! Thank you for the in-depth answer!
@_date: 2013-01-25 20:49:27
Problem was : A transaction got stuck into some Electrum server memory pool and, while i had the tx hash, the actual tx wasn't showing anywhere on the blockchain. Quite Alarming. It turned out that an Electrum bitcoind server needed a reboot. As simple as that. Love Electrum, have donated 1 bitcoin for the great support received. 
@_date: 2013-01-17 14:00:37
Thanks for the advice. Gambling only small amounts here, but i guess it's good to remind everyone to gamble only what you can afford to lose. The question i've asked though is another one, is anyone experiencing exceptionals delays with Satoshidice ? 
@_date: 2013-01-25 13:28:09
Thank you. Have an upvote for a great answer. So i just have to wait until the transaction is picked up by a miner or something ?
@_date: 2013-01-12 12:17:36
 because of the shipping delays announced lately.they wont ship until march and they had previously said shipments would start in february
@_date: 2013-01-25 13:17:25
i would like to know how the transaction can have an hash if it wasn't really sent to the blockchain? what's happening here ? Is Electrum stealing bitcoins/a scam ?
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:14:09
It's not really an hard task, what i'm asking to accomplish, for someone skilled indeed. 60 BTC is nothing to spit at. Plus the costs of going from a VHDL design to a finished device are substantial.
@_date: 2013-02-02 00:18:50
Apologizes. Corrected. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:05:39
Yeah, open sourcing of an Avalon like design is definitely in the roadmap.
**EDIT** Opensourcing the ASIC chip design is indeed something that will happen according to our roadmap and milestones reached. At any further revision of the chip the previous generation would be opensourced.
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:15:58
Thank you for your comment, and you are probably right. That's the route i'm taking, somehow informally for now, i am still exploring the viability of the project, see:  
@_date: 2013-01-26 01:10:05
Did you really expect this tool to be better than google ?
@_date: 2013-02-26 00:21:16
Bitstamp is probably the best exchange out there.
@_date: 2013-01-17 14:13:59
It's been +12 hours now, did it ever happen to you to have such a delay? thanks for your feedback
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:04:24
Because it is specifically designed for FPGA implemetation, an ASIC might end up employing a similar architecture at nano level, but there is some work to be done for fitting the design into the narrow space limits you have to deal with when designing an IC.
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:13:40
yes but we're talking about a lot of hashes concurrently i guess. Operating at higher scales, design issues may arise, scrypt is built to be memory intensive, so running it at scale must follow the same logic, memory need will increase.
@_date: 2013-03-15 11:28:35
~~Bitcointalk.org is down as well~~ 
No it's not, my bad
@_date: 2013-01-25 00:32:55
i think it's slightly favouring the house right now.
@_date: 2013-05-12 04:04:06
Could you elaborate more on what's the real meaning of your periods ?
Do you intend this is a scam or some kind of con ? this is what i am getting.
**EDIT** Of course, since i mentioned i'm seeking for partnerships, i feel i need to add that all formal agreement about shares distributions shall be previously discussed, and accepted by the board of eventual investors .
Of course, if there are any interested investors, there would be a proper escrow setup for funds collection, perhaps with a trusted forum member who will handle, for a fee, deposits from investors in FIAT/BTC, exchange BTC for FIAT when its needed to pay suppliers, and also handle suppliers payment under escrow. Full financial statements would be released reliably, making this a fully transparent venture.
By the way right now, as its clear from my original post, i'm now seeking people with solid skills to build a team, not really focusing on investors right now. But i would appreciate some "chime-in"
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:22:13
As said, for now, i'd like to concentrate focus on a Bitcoin ASIC, other altcoins maybe considered if, and when the project will have reached some remarkable milestones.
