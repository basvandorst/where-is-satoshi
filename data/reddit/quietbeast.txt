The NAP in no way justifies murdering people because they have "waived any moral claim to the NAP". It specifically states that aggression initiated for any purpose aside from protecting your own person/family/property property is inherently illegitimate and morally indefensible.

I'm not unaware of the blockchain bloat issues, but to say that the Monero blockchain is "half the size of Bitcoin's" is false. The most recent blockchain bootstrap file for Monero is 1.6GB. I have a great deal of confidence in the Monero dev team, they get a lot of work done every week, their time frame is long-term, and their focus is in the right places. It's still anybody's guess whether Monero will be able to overcome the challenges ahead, but I think it has the potential to and I'm watching carefully.

*This* is the type of thoughtful, constructive comment I am looking for. I have been considering this issue as well. The best thing I have come up with so far is that a bar could use Bitpay for payment processing, and use the "Payment Protocol" (BIP 70-73) to bill customers, which Bitpay has fully integrated. 
The payment protocol is important here because the transaction is broadcast *directly* to Bitpay (and to the network) so it only takes Bitpay seconds (if that) to detect and accept the transaction, they don't have to wait for it to propagate across other nodes in the network.
Zero-conf risks are also absorbed by Bitpay in this instance, and the likelihood of anyone ever even trying to double-spend at a bar (much less succeeding) is miniscule.

That's not a road block, IMO it is very important for donation wallets to be multisig. If they are not, the one person who controls the one key needed to spend the donated coins can easily abscond with them. In the case of multisig, all the people involved (who each possess one key needed to spend the coins) must all agree to run off with all the donations, which it still definitely possible. It is far less likely that everyone involved in an active project agrees to fuck over their contributors than the one person involved in the project who has the private key runs off with the coins.
TLDR: This is not a roadblock, nor is it DarkWallet's fault. They are doing it right. Use a different wallet that has been updated more recently. You are essentially using a deprecated piece of software so you can't blame others when it doesn't work perfectly, that comes with the territory.

I assume the guy would keep at least some of the bitcoins, given he was savvy enough to make a posting on bitpremier. In that case, those coins would just go to the seller, and I am pretty damn sure that Bitpay doesn't just sell every bitcoin that comes in, on the open market, right at that moment.

It's not a very solid or groundbreaking effort. As I understand it, this record was originally intended to be a mixtape to precede the release of his ["real album"]( so I've tried to keep that in mind.
All in all, there are a few good songs that remind me of golden era NY 50 cent ("Hold On" and "Pilot" in particular), but, as an album, it likely won't be entering my regular rotation.
That said, I don't regret purchasing the first major hip hop album sold for BTC, and I'll probably buy the "real album" too **if** I can pay in BTC.

Paging -
After seeing this thread, I downloaded the Android app and started playing around. I really liked the experience, the multisig aspect, and the fact that address reuse is almost impossible.
I started using it as my primary wallet on my mobile device as of today and I sent several transactions for donations and there was a very long delay (on the order of tens of minutes) before they were even broadcast to the network and showed up as unconfirmed on blockchain.info.
I've never experienced that kind of slowness or delay in broadcast with any other wallet and it makes me hesitate to use greenaddress.it going forward, and I will likely never trust it for in-person or time sensitive transactions. That kind of delay would've been too slow even for a Bitpay transaction as it took longer than 15 minutes to broadcast. Can you offer any explanation or peace of mind to restore my confidence in your service? Happy to provide more detailed info in PM or however you prefer.
TLDR: was excited about the service, then long delay in transactions being broadcast, now hesitant to use it anymore.

I have been following this up with: "There are some companies out there trying to make this technology easy to use and ubiquitous, like protonmail.ch, but we are just not there yet."&lt;/anecdote&gt;

You might have the desire to rule and wield power over other people, but I certainly don't. If that's the case, knock yourself out, get elected for something. Running for office is not a course of action consistent with my moral principles, so that's off the table for me.
You're also implying a false dichotomy: you can either vote, or run for office, no other options. I am very glad that's not actually the case and not everybody thinks that way. Refusing to engage in the political process, participating in the counter-economy, and physically expatriating are just a few alternatives I can think of that could have at least as much of an impact as voting or running for office, at least toward the kinds of changes I'd like to see (but am not willing to exert force upon or control over others to achieve).

I don't understand his comment in this context, but CryptoNote has captured a great deal of my attention over the past few weeks, mainly spurred by my interest in the use of ring signatures for anonymity in crypto. I'm not trying to pump anything, but I think it's a mistake to immediately write off all CryptoNote coins (of which Monero is one) as "random shitcoins", FWIW.

Thank you for this. Definitely better than most attempts to summarize this point. I would argue that the utility of BTC in facilitating anonymous transactions on deep-web marketplaces is what bootstrapped its value initially, but even setting that aside - It is absurd to argue that BTC cannot be a currency, given that it is already definitively fulfilling that role.

They don't need probable cause to issue an audit, and there's also nothing preventing them from using evidence of coin mixing as a criterion for selecting individuals to audit. It may not be long before applications exist to parse and filter blockchain data to facilitate the identification of such activity with relative ease. This is all a tangent rant, but I think it is an important conversation nonetheless.

I don't consider myself a Libertarian, much less a "serious" one. The Libertarian Party is guilty of not understanding the message of this graphic, or worse and more likely, does understand and is exploiting those with vaguely liberty-oriented sentiments to gain political sway, as the Tea Party does.
People *should* be able walk away from systems in which they never consented nor had a moral obligation to participate. They are *increasingly able* to do so through the use of strong cryptography, distributed consensus (like PoW) and the growth of other p2p networks suited for various use cases. I recognize that ubiquity in these technologies is still far away, but the potential of these tools to allow people to trade and interact freely is what brought me to the Bitcoin party early in the first place and keeps me here.
The claim that taxation is a prerequisite for the existence of laws and the concept of personal property is contentious, if not just a non-sequitur.

If a pool/entity controls the majority of the network's hashing power, they can have a monopoly on block rewards, censor transactions, and double-spend. Bitcoin was supposed to be a *trustless* digital currency. If, in order for Bitcoin to work, we have to trust that this entity will not double-spend, will not prevent all others from earning block rewards and *will* include your transactions in the ledger when you send them, Bitcoin is just another trust-dependent, centralized currency with a single point of failure. I don't know about you, but I'm not interested in that. The decentralized, trustless nature of Bitcoin (more specifically, the building, maintaining, and verifying of the blockchain) *is* the innovation that Bitcoin offers. If that disappears from Bitcoin, so do I.

If bitpay works the way I assume it does, you will need to generate an API key and secret token within your bitpay account, then enter that information in your woocommerce (or bitpay plugin) payment settings.
Obviously, the plugin will not be able to communicate with your bitpay account in any way without being configured to use a valid API key and secret generated from your bitpay account.

What qualifies as a "psychopath" to you?
Are you going to go out and murder mentally disabled people and feel justified because they fit your definition of a psychopath, or they potentially did something in the past that is immoral by your definition? (Hypothetical 'you' intended of course. truly just trying to "devil's advocate" here, not antagonize)
One's personal assessment of another individual's moral alignment or mental state is not sufficient grounds to justify killing that person absent provocation; the only justifiable initiation of violence or force is in protection of one's own person/family/property from harm or usurpation.
I specifically recall one notorious historical figure who felt that "some people needed to be killed" and those "some people" happened to be the Jewish population of Europe. The NAP is specifically *not* a free pass to execute vigilantism and/or murder based on personal moral biases and assessments of character; it states that self defense is the only justifiable use of force, for good reason.
That said, I still have very conflicted feelings about ulbricht's alleged forays into assassination contracts. Your points on that are heard loud and clear by me. Hoping to elicit more discussion on the subject.

Are you saying that everyone who runs a full node that isn't mining is hurting the network? Am I better off turning off my VM that is running bitcoind and using exclusively SPV-dependent wallets on all my devices? Is running a regular-ass bitcoin-qt wallet also counterproductive and making the network more vulnerable to Sybil attacks? That seems to conflict with some things I have heard previously so please clarify.

Good points. I still think saying that it is okay to kill someone who "had it coming" is a very slippery slope which the NAP intentionally invalidates as a legitimate reason for initiating force. Such a judgement ("they had it coming") is completely subjective and prone to the (frequently impulsive and irrational) decision-making that seems to characterize the modern human. This is why the NAP specifically does not allow for such subjective evaluations of character or past actions to be the basis for when it is justified to initiate force against another individual.
I am turning in for the night but your response was well thought-out and refreshing.

Given the infrequent usage of mixing services at present, I could conceive of a scenario in which evidence of an individual engaging in coin mixing is used to bolster the case presented to a judge by LE to obtain a warrant in the first place.
I could also see it as being an automated red-flag to the IRS (or insert relevant tax collection agency), auditing any individuals that could be reasonably identified as having used coin-mixing services.
Somewhat unrelated to the main discussion I guess, but my point is I would like to see trustless mixing and/or OT/ZeroCoin to become ubiquitous and easy to use, rendering evidence of the utilization of such privacy measures useless for distinguishing between conventional, evil, taxable, adorable, etc. blockchain activity.

Explain how facilitating trading futures contracts on margin is "borderline-criminal." I can't fathom how you arrived at that conclusion unless your thinking is something along the lines of "if the voluntary actions of other people are not pleasing to me then they should be illegal."
I love seeing people pout about this actually, because it's not going away and all the whiners [yelling at clouds]( are gonna keep getting fleeced over and over again, as markets are wont to do - leveraged financial instruments or not. If someone is not prepared to accept or at least adapt to the tools available to participants in this market, they really shouldn't be involved at this stage. Bitcoin will be the bucking bronco of currency/asset markets until the cap and liquidity are sufficiently large. You can't regulate the volatility out of a market of this size.

I'm with you.
This is not a popular opinion, but careless people *need* to be exposed to the possibility of losing money. Failure is the most effective educational experience known to man. There was a time when even the "average joe" would take steps to ensure his entire store of wealth wasn't in jeopardy and didn't get stolen. Now, it doesn't even matter if it gets stolen because federal deposit insurance will "cover it". The erosion of personal responsibility for one's wealth and security has had far-reaching social consequences. Let's just say it's a problem, and the answer is not to create an even vaster apparatus that allows people to blame and hold others accountable for their own unwillingness to secure their wealth. We have been taught for decades that our money's safety is someone else's responsibility, and that we should be able to reap all the benefits of saving and investing without taking on any of the risk. This is a revolt against nature and I believe bitcoin can be a major step in breaking this toxic mindset. &lt;/rant&gt;

Can someone please formulate a *real* rebuttal of the economic arguments presented by SNI in regard to appcoins then? Vitalik "tried", but really just sidestepped the debate, and everyone else just throws around unsubstantiated sentiments like "Well I totally disagree, appcoins are cool." Appcoins being "cool" does not invalidate the argument about their value necessarily falling to zero because of the tendency to only hold the most liquid, saleable digital asset (Bitcoin) for any extended period and hold Appcoins for as short a period as possible, if at all. I'm still waiting for someone on the other side to directly address the economic arguments SNI has put forward, but that has not happened yet - the best we've gotten so far is Vitalik's red herring blog post and David Johnston's spew of VC buzz words, and neither were even rebuttals.

You put in cash and get a [paper wallet]( which you can then sweep into your wallet of choice. You can also sell bitcoin for cash. The conversion rate is usually taken from Bitstamp. The fees/markup over market value is the decision of the operator of that particular ATM.

What you're saying is that you don't like it, on both fronts, because it is volatile.
Bitcoin has always been volatile and it will continue to be until the market is sufficiently deep. Compared to other currency and commodity markets, bitcoin is tiny, so the price fluctuates with much less support/resistance to keep the price bounded. This is totally to be expected with a market of this size. Not only that, but Bitcoin is a completely novel digital asset, and there is absolutely no consensus as to what it's price should be. The nature of Bitcoin demands this kind of radical and jarring price discovery at this stage, and it will either go to zero or grow in volume and gain more stability, like larger markets enjoy.
As a medium of exchange, the blockchain, and the payment system that Bitcoin embodies, have undeniable utility no matter what a single unit of the currency is worth. It allows you to send any amount of money to anyone anywhere for pennies, it allows you to make transactions in person and online in seconds (without having to manually fill in forms for every purchase) and with vastly greater security and privacy. Just those two characteristics of Bitcoin have the potential to disrupt/transform the industries of remittances and credit/debit payment processing, which are currently massive and highly utilized despite high fees because there was previously not alternative.
It's going to be volatile, it's going to be unpredictable, but the idea and the technology is unstoppable, even if its final manifestation is in another coin. It's fun to spend too. 
Edit: TLDR - Bitcoin's capabilities as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account are written into the code, and have nothing to do with the current market price. When you say it hasn't done "what you would want it to do" you are talking about the market price. Markets of any kind almost *never* to what you would want them to do.

Are you dense? The ID and PIN proves who you are, but the biometric signature taken from your hand must also match up with the one scanned when you registered your account with that same ID and PIN.

Fair enough sir. You can go ahead and toss me in the eccentric, crazy bearded category as well, so no TV appearances for me. 
I do think Patrick Byrne would be a good representative, but I think that Jeffrey Tucker is too (bowtie and all). He speaks eloquently about Bitcoin from a non-tech perspective and manages to hold attention (without saying anything inaccurate) while doing so. Not many people can do either of those things, let alone both together.

The promo did not work for me at all. I had over $300 in my cart and the code kept telling me I had not reached the minimum eligible amount. Contacted support, they determined it was a bug and asked me to place my order with bitcoin anyway and they would retroactively refund me the discount amount in NEWEGG GIFT CARDS. Obviously I found this utterly unacceptable and proceeded to take my business elsewhere. Still have the chat log saved. It was a horrible customer experience and I lost a lot of respect for Newegg, they'll have to fight to get my business back.

Okay then you clearly did no research and don't even know what you're investing in. Nothing about Bitcoin has changed since you bought. The efficacy of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account is due to the underlying technology and the network, not whether you made gains by speculating on it... You *might* be able to do so, but you're conflating things that have literally nothing to do with eachother. It makes me feel sad that I even have to say this.

How easy was it to use tcp/ip in pre-web days? It's not for everyone right now because not many "big shiny button" apps have been built yet. The Payment Protocol (BIP70-73) is a good step in the right direction. Even so, the Android Bitcoin Wallet is incredibly easy to use. There are literally 3 buttons.


That depends, in the U.S. it's idiot-proof with services like Coinbase. Not to mention Bitcoin ATMs. There are several in my city and I have used them with ease. Again, we are in the infancy of this technology. Conversion may become increasingly less important as well if integration into POS systems and ecommerce platforms continues to spread as it has over the past year.


No, credit/debit transactions don't take "seconds" for approval. The merchant's CC payment processor takes on the risk of the transaction failing to go through, that happens way after the exchange of goods take place. The same thing exists for bitcoin - coinbase, bitpay, coinvoice, coinkite. I have purchased products from companies using some of these payment processors and the transaction is, for all intents and purposes, completed within seconds. If you're talking about person &lt;-&gt; person, in my experience that always takes at least until the next business day using the legacy financial system.


Even though I won't be using them, it appears that insured wallets are coming soon. Though, I'd prefer a return to people actually giving a shit about the safety of their finances/property than mindlessly delegating that responsibility to opaque institutions.
There is undoubtedly a lot of uncertainty right now, but the protocol is robust and VC money is flowing into companies that are building increasingly idiot-proof interfaces. Time will tell I suppose.

1. This thing that tourists like to do called having an interesting experience
2. If bitcoin sales are discounted
3. If someone happens to be on the street and has been curious what this bitcoin thing is all about and sees people buying food and drink with it, having an atm there would be a very low-friction way for that person to obtain some bitcoins if they so pleased. Whether or not they spend them on that street (or at all) is irrelevant. I still think there needs to be an atm there if they are calling the damn thing "bitcoin boulevard." Not to mention, people might go to the street *solely* to use the atm, and they'll probably buy a snack or a beer while they're there.

He also seems to think it's funny to snidely antagonize those who shed blood, sweat and tears to build this ecosystem up from nothing because they believed in the importance of Bitcoin to the empowerment and sovereignty of individuals. 
People are free to use whatever service they like but it is disappointing to see that almost every post on the front page of is unqualified praise of Circle.

Bitcoin doesn't *need* to do anything except work as advertised in the whitepaper. *People* buy drugs, so start crusading against drug use and illegal activity in general (become a cop?) if that's your concern, because that's a societal matter and has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
If a money is good and works, it will be used to buy drugs and other black market goods/services. If this bothers you, you're gonna have a bad time.
I'm pretty sure the creators of DarkWallet named it so (in part) to fly in the face of people like you who think that Bitcoin has an obligation to look like/be anything other than a tool for free people to conduct commerce in whatever way they see fit.

Nerd/Weirdo is probably not that far off, and that's fine. Jeffrey Tucker has worn a bowtie in every public appearance since forever - he is representing himself honestly. Free people wear what they please. The importance of this kind of PR bullshit right now is way overstated. IMO Bitcoin is not even nearly ready for use by Joe Sixpack anyway. It *is* too complicated for him right now.
None of the people who appeared on this segment agreed to or would claim to represent Bitcoin, nor the community at large. I've said it in similar wording before, but Bitcoin has no obligation to be or look like anything other than a tool for free people to conduct commerce in whatever way they see fit. We don't need to trick the public into trusting Bitcoin, we need to grow the ecosystem and make it *way* easier to use before we even think about getting ol' Joe using it.
Bitcoin wins by becoming a parallel, superior system, not through marketing trickery and pretense. It's just going to take some time and a lot of code.

Some people think that the most of the market movement lately has been caused by one (or a few) individuals with large BTC holdings (colloquially called "whales" around these parts) placing massive orders that move the market price violently.
I think that's partially true, but hugely simplified. People love to scream that the Bitcoin market is "so f'n manipulated omg facepalm" but this type of activity happens in all markets, it's just less pronounced in other more established ones since they are much deeper markets. The Bitcoin is still very much in its infancy in this way.

Japan and the U.S. are not Somalia. Even if the funds *were* stolen by a hacker, as they claim, Mt. Gox clearly committed fraud by continuing to accept deposits and failing to halt trading immediately upon discovering the funds were gone.
Not sure what you're getting at re: "it's supposed to be anonymous." It's public information who ran Mt Gox. I do expect the community to impose consequences on Mark Karpeles as well.

Merriam Webster: Statism (n.) - concentration of economic controls and planning in the hands of a highly centralized government often extending to government ownership of industry.
Statist (n.) - One who condones Statism
That's a pretty clear-cut definition, not very complex or difficult to comprehend. I understand if you think Statism is a good idea and hate anarchists, that's one thing, but to say that 99% of people who claim to oppose Statism are somehow confused about the definition or unaware of their own beliefs on the matter is incorrect and asinine.

This convinced me not to support the block-size increase. I think davout's economic arguments are sound. A mining cartel like the one Gavin mentions will not exist because there will always be incentive to defect and accept TXs with fees just below the cartel's minimum fee threshold. 
Increasing max block size to 20MB destroys the scarcity of space in the blockchain, the storing and transmitting/receiving of which has a real cost. This will make it more difficult for non-miners to run validating full nodes because of bandwidth requirements, leaving miners unchecked to essentially validate themselves, which is asking for disaster.
Fees would not be sufficient to reward miners once the block-reward halves a few more times, and the "1 satoshi fee spam" argument rings true given header-first block propagation - the blockchain would be full of shit basically. If there is no shortage of space, no propagation-time disadvantage, why not include anything and everything? 
Blocks need to be full for a "sane fee market" to emerge, and that is the only thing that will keep miners hashing and PoW securing the blockchain decades into the future. "We'll fix the fees later" is not a good plan, the free market should be allowed to do that at the current block size, or we could risk destroying the long-term viability of PoW to secure the blockchain by rendering it impossible to mine profitably by year 20xx, all so that we can use BTC to buy a frappucino.

The 21 million BTC supply cap is an artificial constraint that any old altcoin can "get around". Some think that may theoretically be too few units at some undetermined point in the future, and deflationary currency is bad mmkay, so let's just change that now too.
If we hard fork and create a huge surplus of available space in the blockchain, people will stop mining once the block reward gets sufficiently low because they would be guaranteed to be operating at a loss since fees would be so tiny, and bloat will make it extremely costly for individuals to run nodes. It hurts decentralization, the immutable nature of the blockchain, and pretty much everything that is good and unique about bitcoin. Not a good compromise in exchange for the ability to buy packs of gum at the convenience store and publish the TX directly to the blockchain. Why is that so absolutely necessary? Off-chain TXs settled daily on the blockchain will adequately handle that demand.

You know what would make the network less useful to everyone? An unusuably insecure blockchain.
No altcoin can get around the fact that people will not expend real time and resources to secure a blockchain when that activity guarantees them losses. I know it sounds nice to say "hey, we've got room for everyone, come on in!", but eliminating all scarcity of blockchain space will make TX fee revenue plummet, causing miners to unplug their machines (as block reward becomes negligible through halving), and... no PoW mining (at best heavily centralized mining) == ledger not secure == bitcoin dead.
This bitcoin thing is supposed to have longevity. Ensuring that proper economic incentives remain for miners to secure the blockchain once TX fees drive their revenue is paramount. This idea of the long-term integrity of the decentralized ledger is a significant part of Bitcoin's value proposition. The ability to publish a coffee purchase directly to the blockchain immediately at the time of sale, is not. It's a solution looking for a problem, and one with potentially lethal (for bitcoin) economic implications at that.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:22:20

In no way is btcdrak "ignoring everything". I happen to think his analysis is consistent with the reality of the market at the moment. Every time the active swaps go up people start yelling "get long, the squeeze is imminent!", but it still hasn't happened yet and I think the retracement back down to mid 250s is likely, amid plenty of chop. Also, as btcdrak pointed out, the active swap numbers from bfxdata are not useful for determining actual short positions. Everyone is going to have their own interpretation of the data, and that's fine - may the best trader win.

Have you ever been on the fence about buying something? The company offering that good/service cannot be held in contempt for offering an incentive to those people who are considering the purchase but have not yet made the leap - that makes no sense. In fact, any rationally managed company would attempt to do just that.
Effective marketing does not eclipse the fact that every individual makes their own assessments of value and utility and acts upon that conclusion. If you take issue with that, then you're more than welcome to revolt against nature to your heart's content, but I don't see that playing out well to you.

Well, there are a lot of scrypt coins that are profitable to mine, and it's not as though scrypt miners (GPU and ASIC) will just not react at all if the difficulty skyrockets - they will mine other scrypt coins with lower difficulty. So, you could argue that even when scrypt ASICs are widespread, it will still remain more distributed than what we've seen with SHA-256 ASICs

It is costly to establish a reputation in the system. Ideally, serial sockpuppet merchant account creation will be prohibitively expensive, though I need to catch up on any changes that have been made recently in that regard. When I was messing with the early alpha versions, one way of establishing reputation was proof-of-burn. It's unclear what the market acceptable threshold would be for amount of bitcoins burned (among other factors) for a merchant to be considered reputable, but I could see it getting quite pricey to continuously create scam vendor accounts.
I could see how the system could potentially be gamed using sockpuppet buyer accounts to build reputation for your sockpuppet seller. I'd love to hear someone from OB speak to that.
Edit: It appears the OB team has already written a good deal on the subject of decentralized reputation, including the threat of sybil attacks:

I think it's a stretch to say they would work "just as well". You can't even send a Monero transaction (it will be rejected by the network) unless you have a mixin value of 2 or higher. This means your inputs for a transaction will always be mixed other inputs not belonging to you - they must, in order to be seen as valid by other nodes. This builds in plausible deniability, as there is no way to tell which inputs belong to whom just by examining the blockchain.
I do recognize that users could still theoretically be forced to "volunteer" this information (identify which inputs are theirs in a transaction) if they want to use the network, but I think in fact everyone would just flee to other assets, as the features that give the coin its unique value would have been completely undermined and its appeal would be gone.

A money that can only be used or transferred by sending physical objects in the post or meeting with someone in person is vastly inferior to digital currencies in that the physical money has less "efficacy as a medium of exchange," as stated previously.
The *medium* is less conducive to *exchange* because using it requires either travelling around the world or paying/trusting a courier to bring the money to the other party, and will often require gathering extensive personal information about the other party. These constraints are unacceptable in the digital age.
Don't get me wrong, I think Gold is a great store of value and I advocate holding some, but as a medium of exchange, it loses in every category when compared with crypto-currencies.

To clarify my definition of "the market" - 
Markets ARE people and nothing more. It's just a simple and familiar term that refers to the accumulated sentiments and value judgements of all individual participants. The market is not some abstract entity, it is comprised of individuals and it moves according to the preferences they express. So, by this definition, yes, people control the markets, and thus the people would decide whether a fiat currency had become worthless or not.

Bitcoin's value is derived from it's efficacy as a medium of exchange. It posseses every characteristic of Gold that makes it a good money, but in superior form: perfectly fungible, near-instantly and freely transferrable, divisible down to 8 decimal places and the smallest possible unit just as easy to use and account for as a whole bitcoin, and it is impervious to debasement or manipulation.
There is nothing "backing" anything. Value is subjective and the only requirement for something to have "value" is that it is scarce, and individuals find it useful.

This seems like a good place to say something about my SnapCard experience. My company ordered a fairly expensive product from amazon using SnapCard. The UPS shipment tracking showed that the package was delivered, but we had not received it. Upon closer inspection, we saw that it was delivered to an address we have never seen before. We called UPS, and they stated that someone had called and changed the delivery address at the last minute (great security procedures, UPS). 
We opened up a fraud case with UPS and they told us we needed to do the same with Amazon. We called up SnapCard (yes, you can call them) and they contacted Amazon, and fought with them on our behalf to get the money refunded. 
2 Days later, SnapCard contacted us saying that the money had been refunded to them, they re-ordered the product, and expedited the shipping for free. All in all, it was a fantastic customer service experience and I have nothing but good things to say about SnapCard.
That said, I see great use for the proposed honey feature as well and will likely use it myself when available.

Your condescending lead-off of "Sorry dude" wasn't entirely necessary either.
Holding in the short term increases scarcity, which leads to an increase in purchasing power. An increase in purchasing power leads to greater interest in ownership among the general population and also to more merchants accepting it as a form of payment (these two reinforce each other in a sort of feedback loop, both of which also boost the purchasing power). By this point, people who have been holding have made huge returns and will be inclined to spend some of the "free money" they have made to acquire goods and services they **need** (food, shelter) that are now available thanks to the merchant adoption.
At this moment, what do you suggest "hoarders" do instead, squander their holdings buying humble bundles and btc t-shirts so they can do their part to contribute to the velocity of bitcoin? Hoarding is going to happen, and it's not a deflationary stagnation death spiral, it is just the only thing that makes sense given the current ecosystem; I can't buy what I **need** with btc ...yet

I live in Austin, TX and I met a few of the CoinTerra guys at the Bitcoin meetup last Thursday. Some early investors and Ravi (Founder &amp; CEO) were present, although I didn't get a chance to talk to Ravi as I was immersed in FellowTraveler's demonstration of OpenTransactions features.
They seemed like very straight-shooting guys, I talked mining and Bitcoin with them for an hour or so. Of course, this anecdote is not sufficient for you to place trust in the company, but since I encountered them so recently in Austin I wanted to drop in my 2 satoshis.

It could be a temporary haven, obviously not a permanent solution. Let me ask you this: Is it as trivial for governments to create brand new regulatory networks and bodies as it is to fork the Bitcoin codebase? Not even close, governments would be ten steps behind at every turn. Just because it does not solve the problem permanently does not mean it is useless to have around.

You just seem to be saying that seeing a greater quantity of (still falsifiable) data will better validate the claims. 
There is no way to prove this irrefutably in a video, and it's simply not practical or necessary to do so if you are in fact actually developing this software and are about to deploy it in the near future.

Hey, that's me and my girlfriend! Really glad (and surprised) to see this got so much love here.
A few pedestrians did stop and talk to me about Bitcoin. One in particular walked up and said "Hey man, I have a Bitcoin 'account' and I hear they're about to start seizing Bitcoin accounts."
I assume this is a rumor that grew out of the $800 seizure thing on SR, but I basically told him that unless he hands over his physical machine and tells them his encryption password, he doesn't have much to worry about. He seemed appreciative for the non-alarmist information.

Hey ofirbeigel, AKWAnalytics is my partner and we were trying to troubleshoot this together last night. We are using WP 3.6.1. There is no error upon activating the plugin, but after inserting the widget into the sidebar then visiting the site, it never loads the data, it sits there and says "Loading..." but does not progress. Also, it extends down too far, partially covering up the widget below it, and all the text within the widget window is overlapping, much like in screenshot above.

I agree with almost everything you said, and I really don't care about defending CEOs or their pay, as most are just leveraging the strong-arm of gov't to erect barriers against their competitors; I shouldn't have even mentioned that.
I was more curious how you figure communism or large-scale wealth redistribution could occur without an armed authority demanding contribution under threat of violence or imprisonment, and if not, how such an act could be morally defensible.
I really don't want to derail you from your focus here though, so let's just save it for next time. Cheers.
@_date: 2013-05-24 21:00:47
I don't disagree with anything you just said. I was more rebutting your assertion that transaction fees are worse than taxation because they go to a private entity instead of helping fund the gov't. The quality/merit of the particular private private party on the receiving end of the fees is a different debate, which is why competition between providers of the service is crucial.
I likely would not have replied at all had you instead said: "Transaction fees *paid to Visa* go entirely to a private entity that exists for the sole purpose of screwing you."

I would think govs would have to adjust systems and scale up in order to monitor both networks, and any other networks that wealth moves to. Governments do not do these things quickly, and certainly not well either.

Agreed, and that may well be where we are headed, the market will decide.
Proper political function of nations is none of my concern, nor should it even be a consideration when discussing sound monies. The purpose of a medium of exchange is to facilitate voluntary trade between parties and individuals.
Honestly not trying to condescend, but I think you need a little more research to gain a better understanding of the system as a whole. You may find these resources helpful as a jumping-off point:

I fail to see the need to bring a "wing" or "politics" into any of it. Either you believe that it's okay to extort money from certain innovators and producers to re-distribute among the populous for the "greater good" - or you believe it's wrong to extort anything from anyone regardless of the ends.
Politics enters into the conversation nowhere, it's a matter of morality.

Purchasing power of USD is provably decreasing over time. I'd say it's failing to meet the primary criterion for a "good store of value" right off the bat.
Isn't that kind of the point? The less suitable of a store of value the dollar is, the less inclined people will be to hoard (save) and the more they will spend, thus "stimulating" the economy.
