Luckily, never scammed. I assume it was because of the HUGE premiums i was paying at the time. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:25:14
if you're worried about people seeing you buy a brazzers subscription, you'll have to wait till bitcoin has second layer privacy.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:33:33
and what determines what the "fixed" price would be?
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:37:23
so what's bitcoin's biggest problem? i'll answer, scaling. so which of these altcoins do what bitcoin is promising?
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:34:34
the tulip mania is so overblown. it was also in 1 small area, unlike bitcoin which is damn near global.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:49:33
What's the difference between a microwave bought with bitcoin, and anal sex? The microwave won't brown your meat.

If you plan on having a a decent amount of money invested. Trezors or a Ledger is worth the price just for the peace of mind. If you only plan on having a small amount of money invested at the start, just keep it on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:35:59
ill tell you what i'm not. im not ragging on brian armstrongs twitter because i think coinbase using segwit is going to fix this problem.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:10:50
you know, the segwit part.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:55:41
half of it did.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:28:49
I bought preloaded paper wallets off ebay.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:18:40
IMO, the IRS or some stooge like Peter Schiff or Chris Duane doesn't decide if it's a currency or not. The market does.

Vinny's anti btc because of the UASF.

the only correct answer to this is "none of your business".

he needs to act asap. also, this community is cancer.

the funny thing about this picture, it's probably cheaper per square foot using pennies than it is to buy actual flooring.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:15:46
thanks for spamming the network.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:59
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:47:09
cuz im way to cheap to buy a bigger hard drive.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:15:54
sorry, the usd is not a store of value
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:54:07
bad time, hed lose 75% of his bitcoin. =P
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:12:10
let's see. 
so far so good
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:54:38
love that the blame is all on exchanges..how bout everyone quit overpaying for a transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:25:27
good for you. i can't think of a better thing to spend bitcoin on than your own mother.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:05:44
This doesn't have to be complicated. Keep the price in terms of bitcoin for now. Start having wallets show a balance of bitcoin, AND directly under show the bit value. If bits are to take off, Items will start being priced that way.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:36:47
I want to call this "speculation", but it's actually "talking out of your ass".
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:57:52
What people want is fast BITCOIN transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:01:41
yeah, then i'll have a problem that won't be solved till 2019. put your pitchforks down
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:05:10
god, you sound like peter schiff.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:50:34
i dont know.. lost all mine in a tragic boating accident.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:36:21
is this you?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:44:12
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:22:42
better boycott them.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:45:57
yes! you need to pay taxes.. on your christmas money!
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:59:27


Oh, so we should be super happy if fees ever become $1000
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:19:26
guess we're lucky luke didnt get his way with smaller blocks then.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:00:46
good point. don't tattoo it on your titty.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:07:00
it's time for a whole new internet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:02:42
Or the fact they decided to sign an agreement that was only partially fulfilled.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:24:02
haven't seen that innovation yet.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:56:21
bingo. the price stays the same because of no buyers.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:03:45
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:17:28
not enough
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:16:38
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:04:11
maybe they're bitter about core never compromising. Oh, i mean "stop fuding, just use visa, or litecoin"
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:19:53
might as well just use a faucet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:29:12
yeah, i know what the innovations are, but they're not being used.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:15:22
If bitcoin is shorted to death on the cme, will the online exchanges follow? I tend to not believe so.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:14:24
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:41:23
christ, at this point i'd rather just see a fee cap. instead of being slow and expensive, it'd just be slow.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:35:46
i check this site often
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:16:49
thank god, i cant tell you how much i lost out on buying ethereum classic before it was changed to eclassic. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:23


You're right, but in the meantime. BTC could be scaling until lightning is released. Later, the bandaid can be removed.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:34:59
no need.. just use monero. just like we dont need bcash, we have LTC.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:25:39
Probably get downvoted to hell. But Roger would do a good job. Peter talking about bitcoin makes me cringe.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:22:31
Andreas wants nothing to do with this debate
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:57:33
Great point. We will use Litecoin for small transactions, Monero for privacy, and Ethereum for smart contracts. Devs,   we don't need you anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:38:45
great point, and congrats to op!
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:34:30
freaked me out for a second. i didnt see my coins were in the legacy account. im now segwet ready!
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:21:44
i think a great idea would be to put the word "cash" after the forked bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:01:23
It's ok bud. In 5 years, you can feel sorry for the guy saying "It's way to hard and expensive to get .1 bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:50:40
100 bucks? im not lucky enough to buy bitcoin at 100.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:07:03
no. you know the answer why.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:26:58
so you've held through all the craziness of the previous crashes.. and you panic this time? wtf
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:52:46
you mean Blite?
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:35:36
all in on bcash and segwit coin. i would hate to see anyone send funds to the wrong address.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:00:37
IMO Ver always does a good job debating. Also, Richard did a lot better than Adam Meister.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:56:18
Kramer isn't allowed to buy what he pitches on his show. I'd be willing to bet he's a buyer right now
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:10:49
pizza pops? sounds disgusting!
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:45:55
bix weir conspiracy
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:46:13
yes sir
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:21:37
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:42:00
Learn math is right. Please do it before I have to ask for the correct change back at Taco Bell.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:21:58
why do people who have nothing to do with the coin, think they can name the coin? I own zero Bcash and zero Eclassic btw.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:58:17
give her 50 dollars. she cleaned your ass and probably still makes you dinner.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:17:41
this is a great site. thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:40:47
worry about yourself, imo.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:17:27
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:44:30
good for you. that'd be a nice christmas gift.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:32:04
smart contracts could handle this easily
@_date: 2016-09-03 03:46:11
lol spam
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:25:55
reference to bitcoin in the now canceled show "the outsiders"
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:51:52
yeah, they started making profit once they stopped sending 1000 cds 
to everyone's house.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:55:03
it's easy to tell you didn't even read the article. that EXACT quote is already there. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:42:26
it's probably legit. i get texts with people sending me 12 grand everyday.
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:52:44
the real question for me would be if they do accept bitcoin. will they be a holder, or use bitpay?
@_date: 2018-03-29 00:02:34
60% of the time, i agree 100% of the time.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:16:29
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:33:02
goldbugs will just say they use their gold money card.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:09:01
3) I didn't want you to confuse it with Bitcoin Dark.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:45:46
ill stick with segwit coin
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:46:55
lots of people are leaving. new traffic is the real issue.
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:41:34
great site!
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:55:55
which tells me you were freaking out about the lost money. that's why they say "only invest what you're willing to lose."
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:09:06
and in a split second, fudcoin is the most secure network on the planet.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:21:39
Yeah, i know how to fix bitcoin. Have people use litecoin. I can't stand when people use this as an arguement.
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:41:00
Looks like he wouldnt sling shit if the fees were under control.
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:55:43
Shave and a haircut.. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:20:22
wow.. what a fucking fantastic post! thank you for sharing.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:35:28
