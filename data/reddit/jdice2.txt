How would someone have got ahold of my coins?    They were on quadriga before and weren’t touched.  7 hrs after they hit blockchain they get sent out.  I️ used quadriga on my browser for 1 month and entered all my passwords just the same as blockchain

Everything was done on my work computer.   My IT department did a thorough review of the activity on my computer and there was nothing irregular.   I️ also had ethereum in my wallet and it was not touched.

My computer was off with no activity when the coins were sent.  My iT department did a full analysis of activity outside of our server on my computer with a result of 0 activity.  No person was also proven to have accessed my computer within my network as well.

I️ had email verification from an outside IP setup, but painstakingly I️ didn’t have 2FA setup with my phone.  My ethereum in my wallet was not touched.  No notification was sent to my phone
I️ only set up my wallet on my web browser, everything else was accessed through my mobile.    I️ checked that every time I️ logged into Blockchain that it was blockchain.info
Have you looked at the activity of my coins after they left my wallet?  Does it tell you anything about who/what might have happened?

 This just happened to me! Below this paragraph is my email to legal  Blockchain is unresponsive and I was hoping you all could lean in on my situation and let me know if there can be answers to any of my questions.  The transaction out of my wallet is identified and any feedback you can provide as to why/how this happened would be appreciated.   Any feedback on the activity once it has left my wallet would also be appreciated.
Coins which I was storing on a blockchain.info wallet were recently stolen from me.
I am in the process of investigating the situation and would like your cooperation.  
First I would like to know whether you can ascertain from the transaction ID (or otherwise) wether the transaction out of my blockchain.info wallet was signed from the blockchain app or if someone used my private key outside of blockchain.info to sign the transaction.  This would go a long way towards me finding out how this happened.
On 2017-12-18 23:00:11 (1pm our time) I sent my coins from an exchange to this address on my blockchain wallet:
1Hiuh5GvTvsLeiVpyqaB9n5iERYXo2JeHq 
(transaction ID: 077dfbdc8e0b0be3f9af67bca8cb484aa6babc4cc46f14603c03f3dabdd2aa69)
8.5 Hours later someone was able to empty that wallet to the following address:
(transaction ID: eb674f9045277fccb46e388cd4c94f5cf02bb2698e272c030d608f1639e0984a)
Secondly after doing some research on the safety of the blockchain.info wallet I have come across many claims of wallets being compromised.  I would like to know if there is more information available on the security issues revealed in order to determine if my wallet was somehow compromised.
I never shared my account information with anyone, nor was I notified that an IP address other than my own was requesting access to my account.  Are you able to identify if an email was sent to me from your software at the time my coins were sent to the following wallet:  1LHttHk16iGQ7G5hm3tnea2VRs59wbeDo9?
Your help and details surrounding this theft would be appreciated.
