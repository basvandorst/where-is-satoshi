Folks, come on! the main point here is not if MtGox sponsors or not Bitcoin Foundation and core bitcoin code development. 
The core point is that malleability is being sold by Mark as a bug. This is not a bug and MtGox's CUSTOM wallet code (i.e. the code MtGox team built for their own use) in addition to a poor implemented customer service process, are not robust enough to cope with malleability FEATURE, which may lead to MtGox sending duplicate BTC transfers, as exhaustively discussed.
If Mark wants to clean up the mess, he should open the action plan MtGox is implementing, assuring to the customers that:
1. The issue was caused by MtGox's weak code and process;
2. That all technical actions are being taken to fix the problem. As a client, I couldn't care less who's to blame, but when the fix will be in place, which leads to the next item;
3. Publish an ETA for resuming BTC and fiat withdraws, preferably updating daily on what has been accomplished and eventual glitches that may occur during the process;
4. At last, proof that MtGox is solvent by simply stating the amount of available BTC on their storage vaults/wallets. 
Unfortunately, the way this whole thing is developing only reinforces the hypothesis of Mark being drawing attention away from MtGox's profound solvency issues.

Which means that blaming the code technical fix "slow down" on moving to another building is yet another scam tactics. 
These guys are building quite a case on how to steal big money.

It depends on the protocol. If it was just not so "buggy"...

Nice try to get referred. Why don't you make it clear you will benefit if someone signs up using the link you've provided?

The article corrects itself close to its end, but it is a shame a publication as traditional as the Economist uses such a shallow appeal to drive attention to the story.
It was interesting to notice that MtGox history of poor technical/support performance is not mentioned, as well as the fact that the reference wallet code is not vulnerable to the so called "bug".
Traditional finance tycoons are not yet comfortable about getting a good share from bitcoin market. So, their official media(Economist, FT, WSJ etc.) are still confused about how to spread the news about bitcoin: if in a fair and accurate manner or a mix of alarming and plain wrong/incomplete texts.
