It's usually a summation of your gains and losses at the end of the year. That's what you'd report.
You can't have both a net gain and a net loss.

I hope this doesn't funnel 95% of the bestowed BTC out of their budding economy before it even gets rolling.

I always remember getting my orders from dell weeks after I placed them. They don't just have warehouses full of every combination of all of their laptops and their options available. They're usually built to order. It's nothing new, and you'd get the same from of the big hardware vendors.

The difference being, if you were to use say... the Coinbase app as your regular day-to-day wallet, they might be reporting it FOR you and you MIGHT not have a choice in the matter.

Have yoy ever cashed out to your bank account from a reputable broker/merchant such as coinbase? Or have an ETF with the name of an searchable exchange? That will probably be reported to the IRS in some form or another.

I would never trust just the method name when making a decision to use it. And these conventions/syntax go against EVERY other enterprise language currently in use.
 Try jumping back and forth between different projects with languages such as JavaScript, C Java, etc. It'll make you resent Objective-C in no time.

Those are actually pretty common starting salaries for developer positions in those parts of the world (San Fran, Silicon Valley, et al.)

This has also been my biggest worry. Buying/Selling/Exchanging Bitcoin needs to be damn near effortless before it's adoption is widespread.
Considering the mass use of smartphones, I think it's possible.

Which is funny because Hot Topic sells tons of Think Geek's shit, or least they did when I was 13 and still shopped there.

This is one of the great conundrums in BTC. Bitcoin solved the problem of sending and receiving itself without any problems, but when you try to exchange it for actual fiat, we still need to fall back on the "trusted third party" model.
I hope this problem gets solved, for all of our sakes.

So what happens when all 21million bitcoin are mined? What keeps it secure then?

That, or we'd all move on to other cryptocurrencies.

Craigslist, probably. Maybe Ebay with promise to meet and take down post if paying in Bitcoin.
* Find out what title and tag change cost is, 
* add that to the total price, 
* Charge them total price in current market rate of BTC.
