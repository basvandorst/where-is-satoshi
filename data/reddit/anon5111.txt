There are so many better options for a crypto currency. BTC is more of a supreme storage a of value than a currency. A gold coin can be traded for food or tasks, but gold itself is still more a storage of value than a currency. Why use BTC regularly for typical currency over something like Nano, for example? Disclaimer: I do not own Nano and it is 1 example if several crypto currencys that can seemingly do the job of typical currency better than BTC

In price, yes. You have to remember though it is about marketcap, not so much price. Many people think because Bitcoin had 1000x gains since it's creation that Bitcoin making a 2x gain from say 500000 to 1000000 is easy... In this case, Bitcoin marketcap from 8000 price to 16000 price is a lot more than needed for 400 jump to 800.

In Highschool, I used to hang around with a group of "woke" guys. Operation Mockingbird being still active, the dollar being a ponzi, Congress being inherently corrupt, term-limitless shills, anti-wallstreet etc. This was in 2011 and 2 guys in our group went to an occupy wallstreet protest and learned about BTC there and had taught the rest of us about it when they got back. We mostly lost touch the following years and had all bought some in 2011. I bought 20 BTC and lost my keys after moving and throwing out an old laptop.

Simply because it will take a lot more marketcap increase to raise bitcoins price from 10k to 90k than from 100 to 900. If bitcoins marketcap increased enough in a bullrun to send the price from 10k to 90k overnight, it would be the largest bullrun in bitcoins history regardless of gains.

Congress is a swamp of inherently corrupt term-limitless career-politicians more concerned with using their shill platform to make their millions and hold their seats for decades to do so. While you're at it,  try to find a single sitting Congressmen, Congressional candidate or POTUS candidate that advocates saving Social Security estimated to run out by 2034, banning foreign lobbyist, enacting Congressional term limits, abolishing the Fed, etc. because you won't find one. That being said, don't give anything to the Senate.
A prime example is the speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi. Serving her SIXTEENTH term at the age of 79 and sitting on a networth if over 120million while on a $193,000 salary. I'm sure her average %15 Congressional approval is keeping her seat.

Because if she filed a police report like she should that it was stolen, not only the IRS by the Feds would be watching the wallet.
At the least they would question her if it's moved and know if she has account linked to an exchange to sell it, other than that they'd just keep watching it. Also if she somehow buys a million dollar house on a $30,000 salary, they know shes still in possession.

Elite, Illuminati, deep state, shadow govt, etc. are all the same thing and are basically composed of a hand full of world leaders, banks and mega corps that are "too big to fail", many royal families and so on.
The theory is that if these businesses fail, the economy they're so intertwined with would suffer so greatly that it's worth bailing them out. In reality, this is wrong because it essentially means the govt is admitting to turning a blind eye to whatever wrong activity they conduct and consequently meaning they're above the law.

I'd argue by saying because your older phone likely runs slower, begins to lack more tech over time and actually goes down in price, not up like Bitcoin, although that's not a reason you would buy a phone as it's not an investment. Your example didn't make much sense. 
One could also argue Bitcoin will always go up as "lost" Bitcoin increases scarcity and the population increases meaning more wallets.
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:02:09
That's when my hypothetical comes into play, it assumes there has been either a Bitcoin fork and/or quantum-resistant wallets are developed thus leaving the only exposed Bitcoin being the "lost" Bitcoin.
Not sure if you misread or just misunderstood that if the Bitcoin is "lost" it therefore cannot be switched to a quantum-resistant wallet before being "recovered".

There is no answer because it hasn't happened yet. It's all speculative theories as of now. Similar to raising minimum wage. You could argue businesses can't afford it and many would go under or lay off employees or you could argue the increase would allow more people to spend more thus stimulating the market enough. No one knows, though. It's all a theory.

First, the number of millionaires is extremely fluid and always changing. Second, you're assuming a set amount of people split it evenly among themselves based on the max supply. There are already millions of BTC "lost forever" and BTC is only  10 years old. By the time the last BTC is mined, at this rate there will be maybe hundreds of thousands left. But who knows as I'm not a time-traveler.

It's a hypothetical placeholder of "X" and is irrelevant. Also Bitcoin is not going to be 10 million in USD in 10 years. The stock-to-flow has to fall off at some point. Do you expect it to be over a trillion per Bitcoin in USD by 2140?

If the amount is large enough, probably keep an eye on whatever address you had that you "lost" or got "scammed" by and wait for the funds to move again. Most exchanges are required to and actively report yearly purchases up to a given amount.

That's fine, similar to how tips are sometimes not included. However, if one day you buy a house, boat, car or whatever and your income says you shouldn't be able to afford it, the govt will audit you and find out.
This is the case with a bank robber I once heard about. He would've got away with it but ended up purchasing a $200,000 home and a couple luxury cars within a year. The IRS thought it was suspicious and audited him. You may think you'll buy it with secret BTC rather than a bank account so they won't catch you, but once you lie in court and to the IRS, they will catch you one way or the other. You will lose everything and be imprisoned if this is the case.
Again, I'm not telling you losers to report your $300 BTC trading from earlier in July, but if you evade taxes on very high gains, you will be caught.

Stopped reading there, the max amount of humans is always increasing, unless you mean a supply of human resources qualified for a job which can possibly be deflationary depending on their demand  BTC is is not. You're wrong and your example was shit. The supply of BTC is always going to reduce as long as it's in demand to said extent. While it is in said demand, the amount of BTC available is deflationary. Just stop embarrassing yourself, you tool.

@_date: 2019-12-07 00:12:38
Yes, it is. Maybe not right until the last BTC is mined, but it is designed as an ultimately deflationary store of value. One could even argue it becomes deflationary when the "lost" BTC rate exceeds the rate of new, minted and mined BTC. Did you know there are supposedly a few million BTC "lost" as of now and BTC is only 10 years old?

I could argue it does by saying after the last BTC is mined, it becomes deflationary by the fact that the population will always be increasing, more wallets made and more individuals buying.
If you want to feel smart and nitpicky and pretend you don't understand what we're talking about, BTC may not be deflationary itself, but it's supply is based on this principle alone. That's all that matters.
