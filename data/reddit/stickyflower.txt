I'll admit I was unaware of the risks of simply trying to move money into an exchange. All the more reasons to use something like Bisq. Sorry for calling you a dumbass that was uncalled for.

With GDAX you have to have fiat already in your account. Yes it's a little more involved so will have to learn a little but you will save a lot of money in fees. There are 3 different ways to purchase on an exchange. Market, limit or stop orders. Only market orders are immediate. [Read about market, limit and stop orders here.](

Why aren't you using GDAX?

What? All they have to do is not allow the overdraft to go through. That's what happens when you disable overdraft protection. The default is to enable overdraft protection and prey on people who don't know any better.

If you look through history murder rates have nothing to do with the amount of guns or gun regulation. When guns aren't available people use other weapons to commit crime. Let me ask you this what was Englands rate of violent crime *before* they enacted extreme gun control? What happened *after* they banned guns?

It's pretty much been proven that it's not safer.

I care you fuckin liar.

I don't think you're intelligent enough to have this conversation.

That's a complex question that probably only a computer scientist or engineer could answer. But what it boils down to is a GPU is better at the task than a CPU is.

You just don't get it. First of all why do you want to ignore non-firearm homicides? To see the true measure of how safe an area is you look at the homicide rate, not just gun related homicides. What difference does it make if someone is killed or harmed with a gun, a knife, poison, acid or bomb? No gun control has ever resulted in a lower homicide rate, in fact the homicide rate tends to rise.

That's not really a meaningful statistic when comparing different countries. You have to take into consideration the histories of each country and look at that. Also you need to be comparing not just gun deaths but all violent crimes.

That's not what I'm debating. It's the fact that he considers part of the risk simply transferring the money. There *should* be zero risk in that.

You're a dumbass. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:16:18
Your point? My point is that the exchanges should do the same. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:01:04
I wonder why. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:00:41
Uh oh

Sounds like a new farming simulation game.

How easy is it for them to spend/sell that money? Can it be traced or marked stolen somehow? Are there any features built into BTC to help with this?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:44:42
What do you use now? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:53:42
I think we have new meme

I'm talking about for small amounts. I just sent my huge balance of 5 mBTC from Jaxx to Electrum after reading [this article](
Electrum seems to be reputable.

So when is the correction going to happen?

I didn't say that.

Capitalism doesn't work in the long run either so where does that leave us?
