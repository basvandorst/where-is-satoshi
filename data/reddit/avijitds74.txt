I think it will prove to be very good in long term. Imagine a situation where all 21 million Bitcoin have been mined and there is a certain wealth distribution where there is hige inequality of course, and everybody is HODLing. Then essentially Bitcoin is not usable at all and the price will be absolutely stagnant. Things will be much better and healthy if there is huge liquidity in exchanges, real life use cases as a global decentralised transactional currency and of course if the wealth distribution is somewhat uniform. All of these can only happen if these early adopters/whales sell their Bitcoin and we small fishes eat them. Remember, in a ecosystem if there is nothing to eat for small fishes then entire thing falls! I'll be absolutely happy if all those early whales panic sell their holding over night today. Bitcoin may go to zero in that case. But we will all rise in a big way once after that happens. What do you guys think?

I understand. But the situation is quite different now than it was back in 2010-2015. Then one medium investor could buy Bitcoin in the order of 1000, 10000 and so on. Now the number is I guess around 0.5,1 or 10. It's way more popular, expensive and mass-adopted now. So if old whales start dying, small and medium fishes will start eating and get bigger. After some years we shall have very less number of whales, some sharks, big fishes and small and tiny ones of course. Do you understand my point? Imagine a guy who bought 10,000 Bitcoin in 2011 or 2013 with ~10000 USD. If Bitcoin hits 1 million then that is becoming 10 billion, which is insane. He might also have timed the market several times to make his initial Bitcoin grow like crazy.

A year or two may be an overestimate. People at this stage are sort of aware of this 'whole Bitcoin thing' but I don't think they are hardly aware of the blockchain technology and other relevant projects. For example this Venezuela election on blockchain, supply chain projects like Vechain, or say the remittance industry, etc. When the technology will start getting implemented everywhere like internet, then people will start to realise the greatness of Bitcoin and blockchain in general. Right now, people mostly know about Bitcoin in terms of insane gains. But when some of them actually try to use it, then they find it sluggish and expensive at this moment. This is sort of a cheating in their eyes, as the whole Bitcoin advertisement is the cheap, fast and decentralised transactions. Lightning nodes are in steady increase. So I'll say within maybe 6 months or 1 year we will actually see mass adoption of blockchain and Bitcoin. Already these Vechain partnerships, Twitch streamers, etc. are making adoption and awareness grow. All these ICO projects will also start getting matured within this time frame. I understand one thing, that if blockchain has to become internet 2.0 and succeed that big, it needs to be just in every part of people's lives.

lolz... otherwise how would one make any money in the market? I understand that it's like catching a falling knife, but if the buying pressure is so high that that knife won't penetrate it, then the market swings.

I disagree. The usd market cap is not so real in a true sense of one 1usd. That's why when whales move the market swings heavily, causing extreme volatility. Bitcoin has value because we give it value, that's it. It increases only when a buyer agrees to buy from someone who himself bought in lower price. And all these sellers and bots have one particular algorithm and mentality, that when 1 person especially fat one sells, everyone joins hand to sell. That causes the cliff, an avalanche effect. When fat whales start grabbing the dip the mood changes in exact opposite direction. We see huge waves!!

Unless you are a whale/shark don't catch this knife until things get bit stable... Remember, whales get fatter, noobs get eaten...

Exchange's Bitcoin reserve is people's bitcoin, not of handful number of individuals. I guess whales hardly keep their wealth in the exchanges, nor they need to. Cold storage/paper wallet is essentially the secure and impenetrable thing. They hardly get hacked, small fishes only lose in a hack.

By 'advertisement' I didn't meant literally of course, because there is no such advertisement. But it is made for that only. It's just the huge adoption it has faced over time resulting to scaling issue, which in turn has made it slow and expensive. Satoshi possibly didn't quite think of upcoming 10 years and scalability. If he would, then he must be writing his paper in some different way...

You know what, true holders, believes, whales actually exit and re-enter at lower price to accumulate more Bitcoin. It's always the noobs who get burnt...
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:55:11
I'd be very happy if all of them sell now. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:32:04
That's not true. There are many statistics and evidence of movement from old whale's addresses during China FUD and also during 20k celling and 6k bottom. Whales already have timed it in big way. BTW a Mt Gox whale sold his 2k Bitcoin when it hit 20k, and that caused sudden crash to 11k. There are many other evidences. Whales only get bigger dude.

What does that mean?
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:24:07
Not die literally dude... lolz.... dying means they sell off and we buy...hehe...that was funny... you might wonder why would they even sell...but as a matter of fact that happens!

What about the tether situation??? Is it resolved yet?

Guys do you think the current dip is due to the futures contract or the news of two japanese exchange shut down, or both?
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:42:05
Hmm... a materialistic person can never be happy, as there is just no upper limit of greed and materialism. One has to be happy after a point when he thinks he is earning enough! Demand demands more demand!

Sell at 9k or 10k then buy a house of half the size and price of the previous one. Learn to live in a Japanese/minimalist way. Enjoy time with your beloved ones. Life will be easier and you will be happier. Save some money in next 6 months. Buy Bitcoin with half of that savings at that time. And in future never ever ever never ever never never put anything on a stock or crypto market which you can't afford to lose or will regret for losing. Cheers.
