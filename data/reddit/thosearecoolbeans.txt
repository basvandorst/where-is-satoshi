It will be interesting to see where everything goes from here

But this feels like *really* down, you know?
Looking at the value it seems like it was hovering around 6-7k for most of the year and now it's down below 4. IDK if that's a normal drop or not.

I think you missed the point. I absolutely do not care about the fate of my five bucks. I literally only kept it as an amusement, a finger on the pulse of an economic curiosity I know nothing about.
I was just asking if someone who knows more about Bitcoin then I do if they could explain in simple terms why it seems to have fallen so much in a week. Because my position has at most fluctuated a dollar in either direction until now when (to my untrained eye) it looks like it's crashing.

So I know absolutely nothing about Bitcoin and only the absolute basics about investing.
Back in July I received a $5 Bitcoin credit (0.00077 BTC at the time) as a reward from a survey app I use. I redeemed it through an app called Ben and have been casually following the value of my "portfolio" the past few months. I noticed it was worth almost seven bucks earlier in the summer.
I stopped checking regularly back in October and forgot about it. Imagine my surprise seeing it at $3 this morning.
So, from someone who knows almost nothing about Bitcoin or the markets involved I'd like to sincerely ask: **What the hell is going on?**
Is this a crash? A bubble? The posts I've seen on this subreddit look pretty split between doomsayers and optimists, so I really don't know how to interpret this. If someone could explain like I'm five what is currently happening I would appreciate it!
