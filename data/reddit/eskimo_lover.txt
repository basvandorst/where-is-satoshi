Oh, my bad

Damn, I only need to do this ONE time. 
Just once, and I can put bitcoins in a drawer and forget they exist for awhile. At least until I find a better way, which I don't have *time* for.

Alright. Maybe something in this clusterfuck might feasibly work 
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:14:15
No more than 30. That's all I have!

I keep trying to add money on circle but I get to [this](  page and there's nothing to click. What am supposed to do?
@_date: 2016-01-23 03:16:24

@_date: 2016-01-22 07:03:32
I don't have that kind of moolah. 30 dollars is like my limit.
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:19:30

Fuck m8 is there any way I can do it not buying thru some suspect faceless sketchster? 
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:25:01

ThIs is a matter of paramount consequence!

If by "this" you mean your comment, and by extension you, then yes, I assent. This is why so many mothers opt for abortion. Lest they have to raise an "optimal" mongoloid like yourself
