Futures in stock allow some amount of volatility to be calmed down and allows profit to be captured without the trade of the stock itself.
Makes sense they'd serve a similar function with Bitcoin.

What does Travolta have to do with this?
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:51:33
 - that song was originally named Travolta but he sued and they had to rename it. They chose "quote unquote."

I worked for a company where we did 50+ items a day shipped from eBay sales, and we specifically photographed every item as we shipped out and held the photos etc forever.. And we still lost cases where it was claimed we didn't ship out items we photographed being shipped and had tracking confirmation they were received. 
Also, shipping companies, any of the 3 majors would destroy packages and or lose part of them then never paid insurance claims etc. 
We had to adjust our prices all up on products to offset the fraud/breakage/loss etc we didn't cause and could prove with documentation everywhere we didn't. 
Ultimately eBay cancelled our ability to sell because of claims where we had clear documentation we weren't at fault, because they had to settle too many cases where we refused to refund someone because they appeared to be lying.

Not one of those things proves anything other than ability to pass a short test and pay for a license. 
In a lot of cases the real reason they require the license is that the act of obtaining the license is you consenting to the laws you will then be responsible for following, it doesn't prove you have any skill to do anything.

In TN they also charge you $325 for the right to challenge to regain your assets and will seize amounts like $350 and tell people they need to pay $325 to get it back when it's their entire paycheck if they can find any contraband in the car to justify robbing everyone.
Have fun at Bonaroo this week tourists the police don't want tourists in this state unless they can rob you.

That's literally exactly what happened. I bought a car with a bad engine rebuild in 1999 for 6200, then put 8000 into repairs and a conversion from a 2.4 mis injection engine into a 2.7 rsr carborated, drove for 3 years, then it sat for 15, now it's restored with 5000 in it because nothing really broke while it aged. It was like a savings bond.
The engine changes make it arguably worth more than 40k too. The average prices of the 2.4 mis engines with work similar to mine was 36k. Mines a fucking rocket.

Actually did add a whale tail to mine specifically even though the 74' really only offered a duck tail or no tail.
I been considering swapping it to a duck tail, it's about to be repainted right now.
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:48:50
My favorite look is the whale tail with 2" fender flares in the back on the 74-89 body styles. It's just really nice lines, looks extremely unique.

So can exotic cars if you buy ones no longer deprecating.
I bought a 1974 Porsche 911 in 1999 for 6200 dollars.
15000 in repairs/maintenance and 25000 more miles on it now, valued at around $40,000.  My $21200 nearly doubled and I got to drive a cool car a lot.

Only works if the fake subversives manage go convince the real chain, all of them, that it's real so they never challenge the targeted propaganda and switch strategy and I have never seen the fake propaganda outsmart the programmers on a long term working project one of the programmers will notice and fucking burn the cointel because cointel guys are fucking idiots who always look like liars to the real people.

My grandparents were recently victims of a Ponzi scheme ran by a "small investment." That's why there needs to be someone looking to make sure they're not just robbing people.. although, lot of good the regulations and laws did, the TBI allowed the Ponzi scheme to keep running on purpose for months.

As someone with first hand experience inside one of those orgs, I would argue you don't know shit about what we did or where money was spent.
We had dues of 71.50 each per month, which paid for 2 houses and the funds for throwing parties, and what it didn't pay for was gathered by us doing fundraising.
Alumni aren't required to pay anything.  None of it was bribery based.
You're rambling based on reading some stories someone wrote, when you have no insight.
Oddly enough, I was the guy people in my fraternity came to when they needed to buy a paper. I wrote them.

Do you know what analogy means? You wouldn't have posted your band if you did. No one cares.

What point do you think you had?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:17:16
Man that's so many words you posted to make a point that you specifically discriminate against a bunch of unaffiliated groups of people because you're stupid enough to be easily propagandized.
You should be proud of how you judge people you don't know anything about and feel superior to them because you don't know things.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:12:14
You really don't understand analogies do you?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:07:39
I'm not sure what point you're trying to argue other than you repeated a bunch of stereotypes, then claimed they applied to everyone even though you admitted you don't have any first hand knowledge.
Your 3rd hand sources would get crushed by 1st hand ones in history classes at my school, it's like watching a guy who read a book about farming try to explain to a farmer why they don't understand their own job.
You admitted you weren't in a fraternity and furthermore went to a school that didn't have them.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:11:12
What is your point you still never told me?
Far as I can tell it is to type a lot of words and not make one.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:04:11
In summary, I'm sorry no fraternity wanted you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:37:09
A bunch of stereotypes in a row from someone who doesn't have any insight but seems to have a chip up their ass.

You don't know what you're talking about, and attacking someone who knows you don't won't make you smarter.

I think the opposite is the problem. 
We allow our government to commit crimes but let them redefine words so they're exempt from law.

Lots of people learned a lesson there I think.

Would also be really really easy to say that companies without a physical location in the district cannot donate to candidates in that district. That would stop all the CCA and drug company bribery in the state of Tennessee to the state health subcommittee. It is all money from companies with no interest whatsoever in the district they're donating to the rep, the only reason they donate to those reps is their position on the health subcommittee allows them to control the Marijuana law.

You read a book once about something you didn't do, while admitting you went to a school where they didn't exist, but claim to be an expert.
You're like a music expert who never listened to music, can't play an instrument, but read a book once.

There are a few different ways to address it I've heard mentioned, I'm of the opinion that step 1 doesn't even require legal intervention, it requires taking their bribes and making them a huge electoral liability by making them easier to read/see.
Hell, wanna stop it day 1, make their campaign contributors show up next to their name on the ballot as their official sponsor. 
If people knew their vote was a vote for CCA to have their interests kept over yours, I doubt they want to vote for that.
They could even leave them able to accept their bribes, as long as they had to go on the ballot so people would be informed as to who owns their rep.
@_date: 2015-04-03 15:59:06
Preventing someone from "spending their money" is much different from preventing the elected officials from accepting bribes. 
We treat bribes as if they are a free speech issue, because that's how the guys with the money want it. 
A good example would be the entire health subcommittee of the state of TN. 
There are 6 Republicans on that committee, they receive over 80% of their campaign money each from companies who do not exist in any format in their district. 
The companies bribing them all have 1 thing in common. They want medical Marijuana tabled. 
The 6 Republicans vote to table the bill every session, because they are bribed directly. 
The one in my district works for a small local construction company, the only laws he ever proposes are related to exemptions from state laws for construction safety that would cost his employer money, and things that would cost corrections Corp of America, drug companies, and liquor companies money. 
Look up campaign contributions for state of TN representative Ryan Williams or any of the 5 other Republicans on that subcommittee, it's straight bribery.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:01:46
The money figured out it was cheaper to bribe state/local reps to get laws they wanted passed than doing it nationally, the reason you're not seeing the most flagrant bribes is because they're on the state level now.

I can show you a bunch of straight bribery campaign contributions that would disagree with you. 
They're not "bribery" because it's a campaign donation, but you can see tons of bribed congressmen and senators who vote exactly how they're paid with almost no effort.
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:40:12
They didn't pay the right people when they took the money and overstepped their place, and are being made an example of. 
If they had paid some senators and senior members of their agency into their campaign money you wouldn't have heard a peep. 
They made an example of them.

If it's cash and single transactions the limit is over a certain dollar amount and/or looks suspicious. Can't remember the dollar amt seems like it's 4k or 10k but not positive.
