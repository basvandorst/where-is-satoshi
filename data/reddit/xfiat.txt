I can stream it to my TV as shown here:
Now I have constant 24/7 coverage of BTC price movement and news.
EDIT: Technical updates for those who asked:
Server side is built using NodeJS/Express
Client side is built using VueJS
Communication between the two is via a web socket. As price updates come in, the client is basically getting them instantly via the socket...all very real-time. 
The news feed at the bottom is just a RSS feed.

Good idea...I'll look at doing that ... will involve cleaning the code up a little. I edited my original post with the technical details.

I don't disagree :) Actually it will be streaming in the lobby of the office where I work. I won't really keep it on my TV at home :)

Really does look amazing. Nicely done...

Maybe first look up the definition of a ponzi scheme...

Not in a position to compare them as I only have a Trezor, but will state that I think it's an awesome device.
I for one prefer entering the pin on the blind matrix as this allows me to have a longer pin. If I had to enter it with toggle buttons on the device itself, I'd probably end up choosing 1234 out of laziness.
As far as I can tell right now the only way someone could get access to my btc is by a) getting physical access to my trezor without my knowledge AND b) having first filmed me entering my pin while simultaneously filming the trezor screen AND c) keylogging my passphrase. Those three layers of security are more than enough to allow me to sleep peacefully. I suspect for most Trezor (or Ledger) users, the weakest security point is the managing of your seed words.

This. Governments become amazingly efficient when it comes to tracking fraudulent back notes. Report it. They may have cameras in the hotel. There's no reason not to report it - you didn't do anything illegal.

I had the same issue with all the tiles having dropped out of their buckets. It isn't packed well. I spent 45 minutes resorting the tiles putting them back in their proper buckets. At least once it's done it's done.

I hope I'm not breaking some forum rules here, but, I was hoping to catalog all places accepting crypto - whether online or physical. If you are a vendor that accepts bitcoin, please consider listing your company at

So how does a bad actor actually accomplish this? Users who used the correct url ended up at at a phishing site. I get when a url looks similar (classic phishing) but how does someone hijack the actual domain or url? What am I missing?

Congrats on accepting bitcoin ... please consider listing it on xfiat.io to catalog places accepting crypto (no charge).

After basic testing on the simulator, you can actually try it on real devices with a service like kobiton.com or perfecto. Nothing replaces real device testing.
