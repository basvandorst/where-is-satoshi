Look, I hear you when you say people get too hung up on the price, but you gotta understand that Bitcoins are exceedingly rare, so it's only natural that market forces will drive up the price as demand for them increases. If there were only 21 million dollar bills to service the entire US economy, most goods and services would only cost fractions of a penny. I mean, the Bitcoin investment trust bought up about 12 percent of ALL new bitcoins mined last month. Once other funds start getting involved, the price is going to go through the roof. I'm speculating because I really think the tech can change the world, and I want to be rewarded. I wish I had more opportunities to spend bitcoin, since I always replenish my coins anyway, but there simply aren't that many places that accept bitcoin yet, even in a tech saavy town like Austin. I do agree that the Libertarian nonsense is hurting adoption (as if a currency could have a political ideology), and I hope that as Bitcoin goes mainstream, some of that Libertarian fire will be quenched a bit.

So you got in like 2 months ago? That's not a very long time.
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:10:49
Haha so you troll on r/bitcoin as a statement against thieves? Forgive me if I questioned your sincerity. I honestly thought you were just doing it for the lulz.
Also, still waiting for you to buy something with flappycoin.
And about the network effect, sorry but it is a real phenomenon. Hate to break it to you. I'll grant you that Bitcoin, the currency might not end up being the de facto crypto, but a handful are going to rise to the top eventually. Once Bitcoin, or whichever currency ends up leading, is as easy to use as a credit card, do you really think Jo-schmo is going to care about Alt-coins? I don't think he will. Now I'm done here because I have work in the morning. Good day.

Nope, it was a fair value calculation. For what it's worth, Fair Values usually don't mean much, but they're supposed to give investors some guidance on how much an asset should be going for and whether they should buy in if it's undervalued or hold back if it's overvalued. I don't work in finance, but I understand that real finance guys don't take them that seriously. Still, I feel that BTC is way under priced right now. I mean the Bitcoin investment trust literally buys thousands of coins a day. We just don't see it because it isn't done through an exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:49:57
It's not. You're right Bitcoin is NOT trusted as much as WU right now. But that doesn't mean that it never will reach that point. There's more bitcoin users coming online everyday. Just because you don't see it in comfy America doesn't mean it isn't happening, especially in places like South America.

Goldman Sachs sounds like a stable owner saying he's going to start putting motors on horses to compete with cars.

Wow I'm trying to have a reasoned debate with you and you call me stupid. I thought this is what you wanted? Now who's resorting to name calling?
In case you haven't noticed, everytime new FRN's are printed, YOU ARE BEING STOLEN FROM DIRECTLY. And no actually you can't get the same functionality from an alt-coin. As bitcoin's network of miners expands, so does it's functionality and utility. Go try to purchase something with Flappycoin, go ahead, I'll wait.

I think there will be a big run up once we finish this downturn. We've broken through so many support barriers, that there should hardly be any bears left! That and Bitcoin was given a 'fair value' of about 1500 bucks a few months ago. If we continue down, I think we'll hit 400 and then bounce off up to new highs in late April. In the mean time...buy buy buy!
@_date: 2014-03-29 00:13:30
See this is the kind of tin foil hat garbage that will keep hurting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:18:39
So your basic argument against Bitcoin, is that a few corrupt people control a large portion of it and therefore we shouldn't use it? Well this might come as a shock to you but the wealthiest 1% control half of the worlds wealth, and a lot of them didn't get there by playing fair. We're talking war profiteers, vulture capitalists, monopolists and the like. Bitcoin might have a problem with the distribution of wealth, nothing we can do about that except hope that they eventually spend it and it gets redistributed, but the underlying technology is still superior to anything we have now and has the potential to change the way we do business in the future.
Also most economists would probably agree that as a persons wealth increases their opportunity costs of not spending their wealth increase as well.

Not a lot of money to professional investors. You have to have at least 25K to even sit at this particular table. I don't think you appreciate what kind of buying pressure there is going to be once Joe Schmo can get bitcoin into his 401k. Give it time.

This guy just spent more time typing this paragraph, than doing something to help bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:49:18
You know, if the coins could be found, and recovered, it could be a very good proof of concept for bitcoin, and therefore help it gain credibility with the mainstream. If there's a chance the coins can be recovered or found, I think we should do more than just 'let this die'.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:44:57
But it provides comfort to them.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:25:56
This is why I'm bullish. While the Bitcoin neckbeards were freaking out, these guys bought up 12% of all Bitcoins mined last month. And this is just a single fund. And that was at a rate of 25 coins per block.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:06:54
Sure, because scammers don't exist in other markets....

Why is this trolling? This is good news!
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:46:09
Well, this is assuming that all of the people who spent BTC at overstock, didn't replenish their holdings. We don't know either way. I for one, always replenish my holdings after spending BTC.

Did you actually look at the options on the ballot sheet? It basically allowed you to vote to Join Russia Now or Join Russia Later.

People don't trust it because it's new, unfamiliar and it deals with money. I think the best way to show people what bitcoin is about is to send them a little and then let them use it. I live in Austin and there's several places where you can spend bitcoin, so it's just a matter of sending my friends a few bucks worth and then telling them where they can spend it.
 I'm actually thinking of making a presentation for my bosses to see if we can start accepting bitcoin. I work at a Costco and I know the company has at least heard of bitcoin because it was casually mentioned in our company magazine. It would make sense for us to accept it, since we don't take Visa Or Mastercard, but one of the hurdles is squeezing a bitcoin transaction into about 60 seconds of face time with each customer.

Wow the fact that bitcoiners would rather bitch about the president, than take a minute to sign this petition says volumes. I'll sign, but that's because I actually care about what happens to crypto currencies. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, not some Blowjob to Samuel konkin, and it's association to anarchism and libertarianism is hurting its adoption. Do you care more about seeing this technology survive, or about bitching about your politics?
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:29:22
Sorry I misquoted. It was a fair value of 1300, by Bank of America. Take that for what it's worth, but I think it gives a general idea of how much a coin 'should be' going for right now.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:01:08
One of the most common criticisms I hear about BTC when I'm discussing it, is that it isn't insured by the government. I think this is going to be big.
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:27:38
Actually guys old enough to remember know that Friendster was the first Social Media site. What friendster did was proved the concept of Social Media, like Bitcoin proved the concept of decentralized money. Again, I've already ceded that Bitcoin might not be the last one standing, but the idea is still there, you can't just make that go away.
Also Bitcoin savings will eventually find their way to Joe Schmo because there will be some merchant that will pass along their savings to the consumer, forcing all the others to do so as well, in order to remain relevant. I mean how many stores do you know of now, that don't eat the cost of the credit card fees? The same thing will happen with bitcoin savings, they will eventually be passed to the consumer, because the market will bear it. Bitcoin will only become easier to use, and safer as the ecosystem evolves. Now seriously, I'm done.

I don't mind paying my taxes, I just think virtual currencies should be treated like foreign currencies. Under this definition , it makes bitcoin hard to function as a currency.

All the guys already shitting on this idea are a prime example of what's wrong with the bitcoin 'community'. Meanwhile Dogecoin is going to get tons of publicity from Nascar.
