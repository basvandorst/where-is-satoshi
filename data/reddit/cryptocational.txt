If it does. Then people around the world should be rich because 1 BTC is a big amount already and some people can't afford the amount that 1 BTC has.
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:48:49
As long as that exchanges can provide BTC I'm down.
@_date: 2018-06-12 01:10:52
Nope. I'm still buying as well. Buy! Buy!
