i dont need anything but bitcoin to use bitpay...  
  
so again name another btc visa provider that doesn't need some shit 3rd party to do the heavy lifting.  
edit: and a shit 3rd party includes bank accounts. bitpay needs **NOTHING but bitcoin** to load the visa up.
@_date: 2018-08-24 18:00:59

@_date: 2016-09-17 15:08:41
The title is parading around like its a problem with the core of bitcoin itself...
@_date: 2016-09-18 15:07:51
you can get malware just by visiting a site... its called driveby download  
  
and ppl still think you don't need an active anti-virus in 2016 rofl
@_date: 2016-09-19 22:54:20
and where those ppl get public bitcoin pgp keys? same fukin place.  
  
how to hack bitcoin: just hack [this page](
@_date: 2016-09-15 21:30:53
that sha256sums you can dl off site has the finger print from this [dudes]( key.  
  
but theres no other place to get public pgp key other then reddit or fingerprint match from link above.... it could all be spoofed... where else to get [public bitcoin pgp keys]( 
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:30:13
rofl if this passes then thats it.  
  
its literally the last domino that will topple and every single other state will follow suit... bit-license is a cancer.
@_date: 2016-09-28 20:02:56
ur willing to use gpus to learn.... so just mine an altcoin like ether, its the same mining shit, and you would actually gain something. Hell you can even exchange it for bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:11:57
It passed... no contest
@_date: 2016-09-17 13:51:52
Wtf is this about? 0.13 ???

wtf does joinmarket have to do with bitcoin protocol??
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:57:51

oppressive taxation of bitcoin by a major power is already underway. look at bitlicense and like-kind trades in amerika...
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:27:12

prepaid cards are marked and certain number sequences are sold only in certain stores. if you use card 422-222-22whateverthefuck then it can be traced back to the store around the corner of 5th avenue. while card 431-231-31231231 is sold in a bodega in california, so fuck off.

@_date: 2018-04-04 12:45:09
hundreds of thousands petitioned to change taxlaw for bitcoin here... guess what ended up happening, it just made it worse. now theres like-kind transaction law as a final middle finger to us all from them.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:46:37
why making such a big deal lol... this is litterally how it is in america. you dont see us complaining. no one can change tax laws. ever. just deal with it, complaining does nothing. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:03:30
its literally called KYCpoll... seriously??  
  
"know your customer" poll fuck off. this is just so the IRS can keep tabs on people.
