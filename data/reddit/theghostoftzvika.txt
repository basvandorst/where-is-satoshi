Your quite welcome.  Some people should take the advice of Will Rogers, and "never miss a good chance to shut up."

Try reading what he wrote again, but this time, try to comprehend what he said, instead of looking for a nit to pick.

There is no link to that definition.  It didn't come from teh innienetz.  It come from the College of Real World Knowledge.
Go ahead.  Put it on nolibswatch.  I would like to see you do it.  Even they will probably tell you that my definition is accurate.  Go ahead.  Do it. Do you feel lucky?  Well do you?  Make my day!^1

The stupidity here is too hard to bear.
**bundle (verb)**
• tie or roll up (a number of things) together as though into a parcel
• wrap or pack (something)
• group similar objects together as one unit.
That one is a bundle of laughs, and it seems he is a bundle of nerves. Someone should bundle him into a van and bundle him off to the happy home.

Yeah, who cares?  No *link* for you.  This is common knowledge.  This isn't rocket science, son.


If they let you out in the real world, try this in a bank sometime and see if they understand you: "Hello there, Ms. Bank Teller.  Can you please *bundle* up some rolls of dimes for me?  I'll take whatever you can spare."
And while you're out in the real world, stop by your neighborhood nursery (plants, not babies) and pick up some of [this](
 for self-treatment.
