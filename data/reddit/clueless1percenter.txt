I sold a bunch at $8 each at one point...lol
Then sold whatever I had left at $80 after my friend convinced me BTC was going to tank after the Silk Road bust...
Cost me everything I had to buy back in.

I don't know why anybody would listen to Tone Vays, let alone pay for his absurd trading classes. The guy barely owns any Bitcoin himself because he's too busy trying to trade it using his BS "analysis".
Buy and hold it.

They were the very first crypto hedge fund actually, so not a random guy.
They were buying long before it was hip on Wall Street to buy Bitcoin.

Coinbase has been slow on service but they've been decent in my experience in eventually doing what's needed. It's also available in more states than Kraken.
I also like the transaction logs better in Coinbase's format-the format Kraken spits them out in is a headache when it comes to tax time.
Either way with the huge difference in fees I doubt you're going to be convincing a lot of people to drop Coinbase Pro for Kraken.

I thought $11K was a good deal during the crash down from the high and went in hard on it. So gonna be a bit more to break even on that last buy. But I'm holding out for $50K+

I definitely see &gt;$100K being possible in late 2020.
I have literally no clue what the price will do from now until then though.

Once it's at $8600 the meme pressure to break $9000 will be too tempting.

That's exactly what we want you silly bastard. Being uncorrelated means it can be a safe haven in a real stock market crash and if people see it as such they'll move their funds into Bitcoin if the stock market falls. Which will simultaneously pump the crap out of crypto but also oddly mean that there isn't really a serious financial crash either since everyone will have crypto wealth.

Yeah, I remember old forum threads where talk of $1000 was laughed off as lunatic talk and everyone would basically mock you if you made such suggestions.
Now $1000 is a distant memory.
