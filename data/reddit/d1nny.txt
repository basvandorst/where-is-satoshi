You only get one side of the story on this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:04:55
I don't think anyone here has heard of it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:23:18
From only an $11 million dollar investment!

I still don't see how you can replace a sovereign currency when it is legal tender. You would need close to 100% adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:45:06
And bitcoin isn't here to replace physical currency. Credit cards and debit cards are. Usage of cards has decreased cash use considerably.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:34:39
LOL. I can't tell if you're a troll or not anymore. Did you really just say past performance is what will cause it to go up more?
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:17:13
Are you implying there's something negative about this?
Wouldn't that be a given? At this stage in the game bitcoin can't function as a currency yet. If you want most things IRL you'll need to convert to fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:17:05
Because I like bitcoin vs all the other altcoins. Trust and security matter, who said it doesn't?
It's just when it comes to $43 why bother to pay a premium for it?
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:53:23
If you so desired. Good excuse to take time off and travel. Note that the 15% bracket tops out around ~$32k and with the standard deduction you're looking at ~$38k or so in gains tax free.
Qualified stock dividends are also taxed favorably in the same way.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:56:39
Isn't this one of the shady uses for bitcoin that the community is trying to get away from?
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:38:04
I never said I want any of those things. Why do you keep implying things? I could care less about those things.
My point is OP paid 1.2% to transfer bitcoins which is on the expensive side. That is all.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:13:44
Watching it get filled right now
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:27:17
Just because it has coin in the name doesn't mean it's meant to replace the fiat system.
The fiat system is here unless governments decide to give up monetary control and people get paid in bitcoins.
Bitcoin is very useful as a money transfer system for larger sums of money. For everyday transactions you need instant confirmation and reliability of payment confirmation.
And why would you want to spend bitcoins on an everyday basis? Because of its deflationary nature it's more likely to go up in value over time. Spend the fiat money your employer pays you.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:57:53
$4 purchases?
Dude, spend your time finding a way to earn money IRL so you can buy serious amounts.
You'd probably earn more working minimum wage.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:52:01
Of course cash is a very poor store of wealth, that's why sensible people minimize their cash holdings and invest in assets that produce a real return above inflation.
For people like me who have cash I'd rather accumulate bitcoins then spend them. I was just making the case there's still advantages to physical cash.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:45:21
Not talking about trading on an exchange.
In reference to market cap you said - There is no "if you would sell all the coins/shares" or what ever."
This is not true. Like I said in a tender/buyout offer all the shares do get sold.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:20:02
Even if you used a credit card you won't pay more then 10% on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:39:51
Are you just going to use it for a one off purchase or use this regularly?
Would be crazy/interesting to see someone use a btc debit card regularly.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:14:57
Who said I'm crying? I'm just pointing out it's expensive to send small amounts of bitcoin at the moment and people like you seem to be taking it personally.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:07:52
stock shares can all be sold at a price in a tender or buyout offer.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:30:24
Let's not go circular. It's an opinion. I find it expensive.

@_date: 2017-08-23 01:36:19
If you are in the 10 or 15% income tax brackets your long-term capital gains are taxed at 0%.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:19:31
Can you explain more as to what the accredited investor status has to the need for crypto?
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:32:53
This would not be an issue until way down the road when bitcoin resembles a stable currency.
Even though deflationary, lending can be profitable for all parties involved. Interest and lending rates are market driven. The deflationary effect just puts a downward pressure on rates but not necessarily to 0%.
If I can earn 8% in a business venture and someone is willing to lend me the btc at 4% I'll take it. The financial institution then might pay someone whatever interest rate on that amount.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:31:04
"why is there multiple exchanges?"
Because anyone can set up their own exchange and attract their own users. If you forgot, bitcoin is decentralized. There's no regulating authority like with stocks.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:22:18
It is when what you're holding is increasing in value at a fast pace.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:18:35
With currency futures it's like an option where you don't own the underlying. With spot fx your do own the underlying.
 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:41:50
Specifying what country would be helpful.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:05:48
that's reasonable for larger payments but at the moment it's pricey for small transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:56:14
It's higher then some other options but consider it a convenience fee.
It's not a lot to pay considering how volatile the asset is.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:53:23
It's neither but it behaves more like gold at the moment. You buy it because you believe the value will go up.
It's not the best form of payment transfer because of the volatility.
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:33:59
This touches on it.
 
Market caps are better value indicators for stocks.
Another thing to note is the market cap for BTC does not necessarily reflect the value of all the coins if sold nor the amount of money required in the system for valuation.
A BCH $160 billion dollar market cap does not require $160 billion of fiat to have entered the system.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:11:33
Playing devil's advocate here.
What about a payment that arrives instant, settles instant and has no chargebacks? Cash.
Also the bonus is it works in periods with no electricity and/or internet.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:46:32
Your statement about government, inflation and debt ceiling is a signal I should just stop responding. Not even sure where to start there.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:54:25
What makes you think ETH is more likely to go up?
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:29:10
The mentality of people like OP has me worried sometimes this is all a pyramid scheme waiting to collapse.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:32:18
Note that currencies aren't made out of "paper" and US currency is made out of a blend of cotton and linen. The linen is sourced from recycled waste fibers too.
My thoughts are it doesn't matter because bitcoin is not an alternative to physical money - that's what debit and credit cards are for.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:59:58
The price is not just conceptual. Stocks of companies can and do get bought out all the time. If you had $1b in Whole Foods stock you were paid $42 for every share just every other shareholder.
Stocks represent ownership in a business which generate revenue. Bitcoin is a "currency". If the price of a stock dropped for no other reason than selling,  market forces will drive the price back up. The same cannot be said of bitcoin because its price is solely determined by buying/selling demand.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:46:40
they want bitcoin to be more usable and rightfully so. They have to scale up as bitcoin becomes more popular worldwide.
I'm curious as to what scenario would present itself that would allow bitcoin to be the de facto currency?
Would governments around the world give up monetary control? Would employers start paying people in bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a complement to the worldwide financial system but a total replacement to cash it is not.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:37:01
Because it's still much easier to pay with cash/debit/credit at the moment and just leave your bitcoins be.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:59:04
No one knows but be prepared for volatility.
Mathematically much less upside then in the past.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:02:54
Just more blind euphoric optimism.

Because he's probably smart enough to diversify.

Emojis ruined the hell out of whatever it is you're trying to say.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:33:40
Why complicate your life when taxes are low. Paying the taxes allows you to have legitimate funds in the financial system which you can use to buy other assets like a home or business.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:34:17
I feel this is the equivalent of having a politics debate with someone who gets their news from Alex Jones/Infowars. You just kind of let them be and move on.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:20:09
Why did you buy just $6 worth in a transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:04:48
Steady in what way? Yes it's ended up in the at around the same price area point to point in a small sample size of a week but look at the day to day pricing and it was in no way "steady". In the same time frame we saw price ranges of $3800-$4400. Volatility is huge.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:35:13
Sure would be a lot of effort to deceive someone for ~$12.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:05:22
No one said anything about miners working for free.
My point is right now the fees for sending small amounts of money are still expensive. Is trust vs trustless really an issue when it comes to these amounts of money? And note that it isn't an instant payment confirmation either.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:23:02
The question is silly because if anyone really knew they wouldn't be hanging around on Reddit talking about it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:39:23
This would be interesting because I see so many people on here wasting their time buying $4-$25 worth of bitcoin and other small amounts. It's like they think it's some kind of lottery ticket that'll go up 7000% again.
Too many bitcoins for me to hold would be &gt;20% of my net worth because if it collapsed it would affect my lifestyle.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:18:45
"You can't just create a 7 billion market out of thin air"
Add him to the list of the bitcoin population that doesn't understand how market caps work and why they're a poor measure for crytocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:37:36
But more expensive then cash, debit cards, checks, venmo, chase quickpay, etc. etc.
What's your point?

@_date: 2017-08-29 13:31:40

lol. okay. My point proven.
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:24:55
Not anytime in the foreseeable future. Too much volatility and forking.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:42:44
If you want the easiest way go to coinbase and set a weekly/monthly recurring buy. You'll pay about 1.5% in fees for laziness though.
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:58:03
Just curious, why would you consider bitcoin a tangible asset but not fiat currency?
Here's a few things you can add:
In regards to exchanges you can touch on: many many different exchanges, little to no regulations, market manipulation is much easier with bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:25:33
Why is it a genuine use of bitcoin though? Because it allows you to do things you normally otherwise wouldn't be allowed to do even if harmless?
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:40:46
No it is not. Just because bitcoin ran up so much does not indicate anything about its future price.
I really hope this all works out for you but it seems like you have no idea of the mechanics of this all.
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:15:43
How does bitcoin have so many people who are so misguided about how math works?
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:21:05
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:11:11
It's just a very basic and misguided understanding of how currency and inflation works.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:30:43
BTC is essentially a lottery at this point. There's nothing guaranteeing the value will go up.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:46:52
You can barely use your smartphone to make payments at most point of sales with regular money as it is.
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:23:27
We'll see. I think it's a pipe dream for mass everyday adoption we'll have to agree to disagree there.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:53:01
It's more fun to see how misguided some people are. The real answers will fall on deaf ears to anyone that's all pie-in-the-sky about bitcoin.
For someone who has "economics qualifications" he can't recognize that:
Nominal inflation is good for an economy. When it gets out of control is where problems start. Deflation is terrible for an economy.
Cash is not an investment. Inflation of the money supply is not stealing from anyone. It's a necessary part of the economy. If you know inflation exists and you don't take proper steps to mitigate it but feel you're being "stolen from" you're a dope.
The inherent value of bitcoin just like a $100 bill is 0 without faith regardless of how much "work" is put into it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:29:56
Does money in your bank account at Chase fluctuate with the market?
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:39:54
Hey you see my points, if you think they're full of shit then I don't know what to say. I laid it out. The problem is these are all very elementary aspects that I assume people who have a fundamental aspect of economics should just know.
You can't debate like an adult to someone who probably watch zeitgeist videos on YouTube and thinks the government is out to steal from him. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:53:36
Terrible comparison as BTC's market cap is not a good measure, especially against an equity.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:18:01
LN is not setup and isn't in use. So my point still stands it's not cheap to send small amounts of money through bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:41:32
The idea was create a decentralized currency that wasn't controlled by any single entity and create an alternative monetary system.
Are you using the term cash and fiat interchangeably?
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:04:12
What makes you think scaling is so urgent? It seems many people who are getting into bitcoin have no intention of spending or using it on a regular basis but are doing it for speculation.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:43:44
It isn't practical for vendors to accept bitcoin because they'd have to incur the cost of converting to fiat which isn't cheap at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:49:25
% cost makes sense when you have all these people talking about using bitcoin for everyday transactions. Prices have to come down for the technology to compete.
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:07:53
Plot twist - What if BTC was created by the government?
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:41:24
Not in the US we don't. Where are you referring to? We have monetary policy to influence inflation.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:35:19
Why did you buy bitcoin in the first place? If the same reasons for buying true, then don't sell.
Bitcoin didn't hit $4000 in such a short timeframe without a bit of volatility.
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:52:14
No. Think of your average person. Fiat money is already pretty simple and easy for them to use.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:43:16
I feel like this question gets asked every few hours.
It's expensive if you don't know how to acquire bitcoin cheaply/free.
If you use coinbase/gdax its 0 fees.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:08:17
Cash will die out on its own. Most people I know don't use cash anymore in their day to day life.
You can't replace a physical currency with a digital currency. It makes no sense to even try since the physical currency has different uses. You can try to subvert fiat though with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:23:41
Speculative. Not illiquid.
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:50:11
Not practical when you run a business and have to pay rent, suppliers, employees, etc. and don't feel like adding bitcoin speculation to the list.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:51:04
"Very safe"
"Price keep appreciating on a daily basis"
Are we talking about bitcoin or a new pyramid scheme I don't know about? Count me in.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:46:23
Agreed. Many on here though get angry when you point out bitcoin isn't likely to replace fiat (nor should it completely).
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:47:04
They wait until the money is fully transferred out of our bank account.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:45:28
I don't get what your comment is implying.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:00:12
So 1.2% is an acceptable segwit fee? I still think that's expensive.
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:51:20
If you sell with a limit order it's 0 fees.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:07:13
If you mean at the same time/short amount of time then a lot less than 50%.
If you were a substantial holder of bitcoin it would just take some work over time to get the value out.
You could in theory perpetuate a euphoric culture where the belief is the price will only go up in the long term, to buy on all price moves down ("dips"), and to hold. Then you just sell as much as the market will bear and leave someone else holding the bag.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:16:30
Being unemployed and having investment income are unrelated.
What makes you think taxes would be enormous?
Edit. I assumed you were US based when you could be anywhere. Long term capital gains are taxed very favorably here. 0% for those in low income brackets, 15% for most people, 20% for the highest tax bracket earners.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:47:57
Got filled and then price jumped $25. Decent buying pressure.

@_date: 2017-08-23 16:35:22
I agree that these are all great benefits of bitcoin and I believe its value will increase because of these improving benefits. What I don't believe in is a mass adoption replacing fiat scenario because of those benefits.
You're incredibly idealistic about what the average person cares about. Do you live in a social/economic bubble? If they don't care about it now why would they care about it later?
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:29:38
Most people I've encountered have always had trouble using a fax machine.
What benefits does crypto offer the average person? I'm curious because the many people in the US can barely handle how a checking account/credit card works.
And if you understand how bitcoin works you're far from the "average" person.

Keeping 158k in a wallet is cause enough for attention. All your moves will cause someone to notice.
