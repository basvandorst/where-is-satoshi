They are on reddit I did not link them to this thread though.    Also, other merchants wont see this if its downvoted all the way.. down **FYI** ;)

LOL... more like visa/mastercard shills worried about their pie (maybe we can trick bitcoiners into never using their coins).   Same game.      Telling me to use fiat... LOL

I havn't had the best luck getting things for BTC.  Seems like a new age.  The news is more positive. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:59:21
If their clients only have cryptocurrency... what then?  
*People just shouldn't have stuff.... its all or nothing...*

What if a merchant dosn't have a means to hodl or keep bitcoin or maybe they need to convert these payments to pay off loans and production costs.  While I agree that its unfortunate that the masses wont get the ride the p2p/deflation wave that many of us have come to understand I think it is just as important for the users that have invested in Cryptocurrency to have access to goods and services.   
As for privacy, what are you talking about here really?  I thought we are talking about bitcoin which has a terrible privacy track record, seeing that its a **open database of treasure chests**.  I know satoshi had a dream, but If you look at the records... he moved on a long time ago.
Use chainswaps on coinbase if you want more privacy ~ billing info is irrelevant. 
Anyway, thanks for the downvote and the lack of support.  Was just trying to get a new skate company some eyes.

We've got a maximalist over here.  Bitcoin is neat.  But not perfect or private.  Most people don't understand it.  Its not private in any way and thats fine.
Nope, eskates for crypto.. ftw
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:03:41
Im just glad an e-skate company accepts bitcoin ;D
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:01:42
Is BTCPay already an option in the shopify settings?   
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:11:20
Bitcoin is a protocol don't spout dogma.   
I understand this.. I wish that everyone got on the crypto train.  But Im also a programer living overseas who works for Crypto.  Its alot easier for me to use crypto to purchase things then go through the necessary means to transfer into fiat, find a banking institution, and keep up on credit cards.   While I understand the sentiment we all have different needs.   Im sorry that this company has chosen to use a cartel to accept payments(similar to payment terminals used for creditcards/debitcards at any major store... these are intermediaries). 
If we try and tell everyone that there is only one way to use bitcoin you are going to scare off many of new comers who are still seeing bitcoin for dollars.

Its not my shop.  I just like skateboards.   Plenty of good products out there use shopify for their warehousing/shipping/logistics.   Its alot more then just a webshop.
I could of used a giftcard on any number of knockoff or overpriced e-skates from amazon sellers at inflated prices for a while now and havn't.  This is the first company that has allowed me checkout directly from their shop.   I dig it.   
You don't have to shop there and you don't have to support expanding crypto usability.  Just preach on!
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:08:16
So an established merchant who is focusing on a product not currency shouldn't do business with me because they can't support an entire open source merchant platform on their own?
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:00:02
Bestbuy use a payment processor to integrate with banks, because they are not a bank or credit card processor themselves.  Instead they get cash deposits the same way.  Do they now accept Credit/Debit or are they enabling payment processing platform.   What makes more sense coming out of your mouth when trying to tell people they can use a credit card somewhere?
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:55:07
Does he accept fiat as well?
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:38:42
I'd read some code/bip if you want to link git.  But Im OK for bitcoin articles.  Still many things to overcome.

Up vote the thread if you think its important the community sees this conversation.. they don't happen every day.

Privacy should be baked into the protocol.   Services will catch up as does the demand.
I agree coinbase and bitpay are a long term disservice to their customer.  Hopefully people will wake up and choose to hold better monies then what they have been taught.  
In the meantime I'm not gonna be pushing up hills this spring.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:33:08
Thats pretty harsh, no?  Economy is going to be one of the greatest and most painful learning experiences of our age.   
I guess your busy keeping warm by the fire.  *Enjoy the show.*
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:59:40
Wouldn't coinbase have to sell their coins to replenish cash reserves for their customers?  
Payment integrations are good, not everyone is private key rocket surgeon.

*Most (not all)* the people I've interacted with over the years who end up accepting cryptocurrency are still quite tied into traditional systems.  Whether it be through loans or payment utilities. They have been receptive to the cause and want to support users but they don't want to take the risk.   Now all of these people regret the decision of letting btc fly through their fingers except for the few that listened when I said you may just want to **hodl.** 
It has set an example in the community as there are now a few hodlers and many people who exchanged crypto for quick fiat.  Those quickfix people are learning more albeit through frustration and are becoming hodlers themselves.

I bet if shopify offered more options it would be possible.  AFAIK established shopify businesses are kinda locked into what ever shopify supports.
