I never had any issues with UBS. You either had bad luck or there is a reason why they didn't take you in.
It is true though that Swiss banks are paranoid with everything linked to the US. If you are not a Swiss citizen they are very careful these days. You can thank the EU and USA for that.

I do not suggest we should too much read into this, but I think it is still interesting to see that the trends are very similar so far...

Yeah, I have taken it directly from coinmarketcap.com on the exact same (linear) scale and with the same time steps. It's just a simple screenshot of the graphs when looking at dates Jan 2017 until today (more or less). However, I am pretty sure that we can already forget about the similarities now. Back in 2017 it continued pumping shortly after the small downer.

The pre-peak (before the red line stops) has taken place on November 29 at around USD 11'500, the low point one day later at around USD 9'300. Now would be December 1.

You are missing a lot.
What if something happens and you cannot pay back the loan? You cant pay back by crypto if it doesnt increase enough. It might destroy your whole life.
Use the money you have now and invest it step by step. Buy when you feel like it’s dropping. It is never good to throw in all at once in such an unstable environment. Whenever you cannot afford to go in, simply stop your investments.
It doesn‘t truly sound you can afford to lose everything. Only if you look at your portfolio at 10 % of the original value without being sad/afraid, you are good to go. It‘s easier said than done now. But will you still hodl at 100 $ if you take a loan of thousands of dollars to pay a 10k $ BTC price?

You should transfer it back to a bank account. Please keep in mind, that depending on your location, you might need to pay taxes! As others have said, converting BTC back to fiat is rarely a good idea. Better use a service like TenX which lets you pay your daily stuff with a credit card linked to a wallet.
You say that you have to convert it back because you need it. This is a clear indicator that you invested money that you cannot really afford to lose. Rule number one for investing anywhere: Never invest what you cannot afford to lose. Period!
