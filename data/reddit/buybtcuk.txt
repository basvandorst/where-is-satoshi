AFAIK bitco.il was operating mid 2012.

Not sure, but there was a point early 2013 when 2-3 of the major banks in Israel froze accounts for Gox users.

the limits have been going up steadily since the earlier versions

I'd recommend Jaxx (HD) if you want to use Ethereum tokens in the same wallet. There's no support for $etc, but I imagine there will be as soon as there are apps running on it (not that $eth has any apps running on it).

Please explain

How many is low amount?

I remember when this was filmed at a London Bitcoin Meetup :) Last time I visited the place was in late 2014 and they still accepted bitcoin. [great beer &amp; food selection]

Not a cultist, he sent a message to have a bus waiting outside of the Coinscrum venue at 19.15. The speaker at Coinscrum starts at 19.30. That's plain rude.

How is this done? Are you banking in the UK?

I send btc/eth to an address and get rewarded plutons (eth asset). The plutons show as sterling on my app, but then price of btc/eth drops 25%. Does my sterling account go down 25%?  
cc thanks

Fake News!
@_date: 2016-06-25 11:13:33
As a potential user am I exposed to the price of Eth?
@_date: 2016-06-05 20:45:31
Is he still all-in (bullish) on bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:49:21
Coinbase is not a bitcoin wallet (because you don't have control over the funds).

did he just coin a new term?

Out of all the wallets I ever used bc.i is the most buggy. Ironic that it's from the co that complains the most about Bitcoin's tech. Since the take over from Ben, it's been downhill (but pulling out great salaries from the VC money surely)
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:18:05
As a concept (this video was recorded 3 years ago), bitcoin's sound to replace cash.  The tech, however, needs LN to have a whole society using.

Bitsquare 
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:02:35
has a business relationship with Bitmain (what is now days called a cryptopreneur), and that's why he's shilling for them. In the near past, he's been attacking individuals personally (with no evidence), so nothing new in the case of attacking @_date: 2017-05-19 18:54:16


@_date: 2017-05-22 16:11:18
Thank you!

I will buy one and will stop using my Ledger.

Bitsquare is the way to go (for small amounts) if you want a good rate and minimal (voluntary) KYC/AML

Thanks!  I used Bitsquare. The decentralised (p2p) aspect does make them much more attractive.  It took less than 20 mins to set up and have the coin.  
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:36:07
Lost a little sleep over it until Vitalik/Gav decided to move on with what I consider a terrorist act against the crytpo community as a whole. Now I lose more sleep. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:20:43
Bitsquare and if you don't feel comfortable, Local Bitcoins
@_date: 2016-07-06 09:03:33
when are people going to stop complaining about the problems they're having with Coinbase and move on to better, more friendly exchanges (Coinbase isn't a wallet)?
@_date: 2016-07-01 08:15:35
I don't really understand why people are suprised that the Coinbase guys behave like any commercial bank, but without the normal customer service.  If anyone reads their strategic moves since 2012 it's obvious that this is what they wanted.

The talk was pretty short, but informative. To be fair to Charles, he looked like he hasn't slept for a few days prior and I'd like to thank him for his time. Great Q&amp;A session!
