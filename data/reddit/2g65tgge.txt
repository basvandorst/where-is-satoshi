Well, if bitcoin switched to PoS today, then satoshi nakamoto would own about 6% of the network, and the chinese miners probably would own close to 50%. If you have 51% in PoS, you can keep 51% forever... Many new coins are PoS from the beginning and the initial supply is auctioned in an initial public offering, which can very easily be used as a ponzi scheme.

Users missed out on early adopter phase, because most of the BTC supply is already distributed. Adoption of cryptocurrencies is still below 1% of its potential. Bitcoin development has a lot of friction. Newer coins have implemented fixes to emerging issues in older cryptos. This makes newer coins more attractive than older coins. It also makes inflationary coins more attractive than deflationary coins in the long run, but not in the short term. If bitcoin had been configured to yield 50 coins every 10 minutes forever, then it could still make sense to mine it 100 years after mainstream adoption. A growing economy needs a growing supply of currency, PoW decentralizes the minting process and delegates it to a computational race, but makes the process honest and predictable, and inflation encourages money being used for development rather than exiting the economy altogether to be hoarded.
Edit: And ideally the adoption curve should match the supply emission curve.

The USD holds it's value largely because of the position of the IMF in world trade and because of major oil trade contracts being negotiated in USD, as well as the very particular real estate market conditions of the USA. It also enjoys a positive feedback loop where other unstable economies resort on using the USD to shield against inflation, for example the real estate market in Ecuador or Cuba.
