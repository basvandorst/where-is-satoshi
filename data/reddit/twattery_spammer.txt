Technically it was brits. Feds were assisting.

Crafts and ability as opposed to delusional ramblings.

Please do not breed.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:19:37
again, please do not breed. You are assuming that fanboys time is free and infinite. Maybe it is in your case.
Just do not reproduce.

It isn't.
Go and learn to play poker (adequately). It will make sense then.

okay, let us break it down:


Applies to most activities that require your attention/time investment


"Opportunity cost" is what you lose if you do not focus your _available_ resources/time/attention to the activity that will generate the highest return.
For example a software company that keeps building phones while everyone else is shifting to ear implants is paying an enormous opportunity cost for finding itself later in a position where it has no know-how or market share.


We all would like to be able to experiment with infinite number of long bets (and BTC was nothing more than that in its early days. Just like lots of nowadays shitcoins that had their own unique differentiators).
However in practice you have only that much money, only that much computing power and only that much time. Time, in particular, is something nobody discusses. I've seen people here invest their time as if looking after their 0.001BTC (and that's all they own) is their full time job. While they could be earning $100+ easily.
As for the poker reference. Same concept there is called "Bankroll management". You have to know when you can afford to go deep and risk a lot and when to lock down and play safer. It wouldn't be a problem if a good poker player (who would, on average, always win) had infinitely deep bankroll.
Lots of early BTC enthusiasts, myself including, got burnt at some point where external circumstances forced us to liquidate. Shit happens. 2 ze mun is not guaranteed.
