Today we added the payment method SOFORT. SOFORT Banking is an online direct payment method and works on the basis of tried-and-tested online banking.
The big advantage is: You don't need to register or open an account. It is an immediate and direct transfer of funds.

Our service  doesn't have that problem. If you buy Bitcoin we'll send them straight to your personal wallet. When you sell Bitcoin you send them from your own wallet to a unique address and we try to transfer the funds within 2 hours (sometimes it takes a little longer). 
The advantage of our service is that you can choose your buy or sell momnet without having money sitting on a exchange for a long time. You buy and sell straight from your bank account and don't have to use a exchange as a bank.
If something would go wrong only our own funds are at risk, not the funds of our customers.
If you have any questions please let us know.

In this way you can profit from (short term) buy opportunities.

The bank validation is needed when you use iDEAL. At Anycoin direct you don't have to send 0.01 euro by SEPA but you can pay 1 euro with iDEAL (You get the 1 euro back as discount) which is instant.
You only have to validate yourself with an ID/passport when you want to order big amounts.
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:05:15
Yes, that is correct. If you would do high frequency trading our service wouldn't be ideal. But for customers who buy or sell only once in a while it is a good alternative to a exchange. Mainly because of the speed and ease of use of our platform.

Hi Zoopz, 
Thanks for you info. We are aware of the risks regarding Sofort. Because of that risk we have strict limits for new users. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:03:41
That is also what we think is reasonable, but some Sparkasse branches don't allow to do the transfer, even when the customer asks to do this.
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:08:29
Thank you for your feedback.
The fee's that are charged are mostly fee's we pay to our payment provider. The payment provider fee varies from 0.5% - 5%, depending on the payment method.
By trading on various exchanges we try to keep our pricing as competitive as possible. $1 @_date: 2015-01-09 14:06:00
With Sofort Uberweisung, when a transaction is made the money is reserverd (and shows that is has been deducted from the bank account). The real transaction is processed at night in bulk and can be stopped before it has been processed.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:18:34
Hi Giszmo,
We operate since April 2013 and have served 8.000+ customers since.
For your reference: 
The problem we now had with Sparkasse is that we did sent the bitcoins but did not receive the money. 
Please let us know if you need more information.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:35:59
We operate since April 2013, for your reference:
We also don't hold customers funds, we send the bitcoins instantly after a succesful payment.
@_date: 2015-01-23 08:01:35
Thanks for your feedback. We will discuss this with our payment provider Salt. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:32:37
Indeed, so it's not a chargeback but it can be stopped (unfortunately). That is the main issue in this matter, if the transaction cannot be stopped by the bank once it's done there would be no problem.
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:06:47
At this moment we only see SEPA orders being blocked (paid with Sofort, OBT or just normal SEPA).
We only offer our service in Europe (at this moment) so we don't have information about non-SEPA SWIFT transfers.
But since this is started very recently we are still investigating this matter. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 08:00:11
We process the transaction instantly. To prevent fraud we send the bitcoin 24 hours after the payment for unverified aaccount. For verified accounts the bitcoins will be sent instantly.
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:02:35
This funding has helped us to expand our services to Canada, supporting INTERAC Online. We will expand our services to more and more countries in the near future.
Please let us know if you have any suggestions.
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:42:07
Yes, some payment methods charge a higher % than others
@_date: 2015-01-09 10:47:31
At this moment we only experience problems with Sparkasse, other banks  like Fidor cooperate in a normal way.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:50:55
Yes, some customers had this problem also using a normal SEPA transfer, also with payment option OBT (
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:30:12
Your are right that you can't chargeback a SEPA transaction. But it isn't a chargeback because the money hasn't transferred yet (it's reserved). You can't cancel the transaction yourself but the bank can before it has been sent (at night).
For instance, when somebody hacks your bank account and buy bitcoin on saturday using Sofort, your bank is able to cancel it during the weekend.
Sofort wants to get the impression that it's irreversible, but until the transaction is really processed it can be undone. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:41:17
Thanks! We will look into it
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:34:50
Thanks for this information. 
Unfortunately this makes us to wait until the money is arrived at our bank account so we can't send the bitcoins instantly.
@_date: 2015-01-09 10:52:07
Sparkasse is calling customers to reverse the Sofort payment they have done to buy bitcoins.
We get a success message from the payment method (Sofort Uberweisung) and the customer wants to transfer the money, but the bank reverses this transaction. This means that we have sent the bitcoins, but the payments don't arrive at our bank account.
At this moment we did not get any information from Sparkasse, nor want to comment on this matter when we contacted them. They just cancel the transaction.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:20:24
Thanks for sharing your experience. We have had some reports of this in the history but not at this scale. 
 
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:32:38
Thanks, we are looking in to this. 
This can be used to process the transaction a little faster, but we do have wait until the money arrives. Normally we send the bitcoins after a successful message from the payment method.
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:34:38
You are right, in fact there are 413 regional Sparkassen (according to wikipedia).
But because we see transactions being blocked by different local branches we do think there's some sort of a "central directive".
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:09:06
Please let us know if you have any questions about our services in Canada!
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:00:55
That's true. but unfortunately it's the most used payment method for direct payments in German speaking countries in Europe.
We rather see something like iDEAL (holland) or MyBank used in whole Europe.
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:40:53
That's true. But it seems like they have policies that they all follow. We see many different Sparkasse banks calling their customer and crediting the money back.
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:18:00
You can complain at your local Sparkasse bank by telephone or email. The more people complain the more likely they will do something about it.
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:56:08
Yes that is possible, it's just strange that they call so many customers but don't want to inform us about this.
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:42:43
Thank you for this comment. 
We are well aware that our service attract fraudsters and hacked bank accounts. For this reason we have implemented and extensive KYC policy that includes sending a copy ID, Proof of Residence. We even have implemented a new validation option, the live webcam validation.
Our main issues are that we aren't informed and we get no information at all when we contact Sparkasse.
Also, some customers report that they are called by their bank and they say they want to transfer the money but the bank won't let them.
I think banks need to be careful and need to prevent fraud, but when a customer wants to buy bitcoins the aren't allowed to deny that request.
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:02:31
Sparkasse also operates in Germany: 
*"The German Savings Banks Finance Group (Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe) is the most numerous sub-sector with 431 savings banks using the Sparkasse brand"*
But they are indeed seperate banks using the Sparkasse brand.

I don't know the exact volume figures of Bitonic. But they only operate in the Netherlands and Belgium. We are active in almost whole Europe and actively looking to expand to more countries. We handle lage volumes without a problem.
