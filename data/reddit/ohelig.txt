Right, I forgot about the difficulty adjustments, so removing timestamps isn't an option. 
Edit- but I don't get what you mean about invalidating all mining equipment. You mean removing the timestamp would? Or do you mean that a hard fork adding 4 bytes to the timestamp would?

Bitcoin suffers from a form of the [Year 2038 Problem]( Because it uses an unsigned 32-bit int as the timestamp for blocks, we shouldn't run in to problems until February 7, 2106, but it wouldn't hurt to fix it now. Switching bitcoin to a 64-bit int timestamp would require a hard fork and, if there is going to be a hard fork over the blocksize issue, it makes sense to address the 2038 problem at the same time since hard forks are disruptive and this issue is apparent and not controversial.
~~Alternatively, we could remove timestamps from blocks altogether. Still a hard fork, but then we don't run in to problems in the year [292,277,026,596]( when a signed 64-bit timestamp would overflow.~~ Edit: Not an option, as pointed out.
For either case, the bitcoin proof-of-work hash includes the timestamp, so we couldn't go back and re-do old blocks without mining them again.

It sounds like a software update would fix that then, right? If not, we should still have plans put in place to make hardware compatible with a 64-bit timestamp, because changing the epoch every few decades is not a good long-term solution.

Waiting decades to find a solution is a bad idea because as Bitcoin gets larger, a hard fork gets more disruptive and maybe unfeasible.

Is it okay to continue the [discussion from yesterday]( on the [Year 2038 Problem]( (or 2106 in Bitcoin's case)?
said that changing the size of the timestamp in the block header from 32 to 64 bits (4 bytes to 8 bytes) would "invalidate all mining equipment". I'm not entirely sure if that means the hardware would be useless, or if a software update could fix the problem, but I don't know enough about the ASICs to say myself. If it's a hardware problem and we decide to change the block header size, one solution would be to start producing hardware that supports it now, but the actual change wouldn't happen for several decades when the non-supporting hardware is not in use.
I asked gmaxwell on IRC and he proposed to just let it overflow and, to figure out the true date of the block, just count the number of times it has overflowed since the beginning of the blockchain. The only downside is that it requires a block to be mined at least once every 2^32 -1 seconds (about 136 years). So assuming a block is mined at least once every 136 years, we're fine. If changing the size of the block header is not an option, this seems like the best solution.
gmaxwell did bring up that [nLockTime]( wouldn't work using UNIX timestamps after 2106
