Imagining a best case future scenario for bitcoin I picture it being more analogue to Linux
This highly technically obscure thing that nerds use to boost their nerd cred that is basically only actually good for running servers on.
What do you mean my and a few billion other android phones run on Linux? It's an android. It can't have anything to do with Linux, see how easy it is to use?

Selling/buying hats in TF2 and weapon skins in CSGO and the case/crate keys for them is pretty great with BTC

Find a coin with under 2 btc daily volume, plenty of those - then just wash trade with your account taking the loss every time until you've got nothing left

You can easily save 25-30% on steam by dealing with a reputable trader instead of depositing your money directly with steam
