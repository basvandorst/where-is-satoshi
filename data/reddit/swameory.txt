Nothing. Which is why some people will be flocking to the rumored Wall Street exchanges if they open. The claim is they will be regulated and therefore unable to commit fraud as easily. 
But some people will want to stay away from that too for various reasons.

Absolutely. You can "work" for BTC this way, and that makes it easier to spend it knowing you can always work for more. PROTIP: be good at poker first.

As someone who made a bunch of BTC at probably the same site, thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:28:41
How much 2 girls at one time?  Because of course so much BTC
