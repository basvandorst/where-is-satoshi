Currency must have some intrinsic or perceived value by those who use it, otherwise it's garbage.  A "hidden" crypto currency would be useless if very few people used it. It's be like trading cubic meters of rare air from around the world.

The FED would never decentralize the USD.  They'd lose too much power.  They'd declare war on Bitcoin if it became too popular.
Hypothetically, if I were The FED I would buy/confiscate as much Bitcoin as possible (with money I printed and the government(s) I own), wait until I think it's is too popular, and then stimulate panic selling by simulating multiple panic selloffs out of the blue.  This would debase Bitcoin value which enable me [The FED] to then purchase more Bitcoin to then simulate yet more and greater panic selloffs.  Eventually I would own nearly ALL Bitcoin in circulation! HEHEHE!

I'm glad to see them go.  It means the market is evolving.

How much effort does it take to copy/paste a link to a current news story?  5 seconds?  Up-to-date news does not sift to the top quickly enough to be relevant during a big sell off...

I don't mean to get all "conspiracy theorist" here, but considering the FED owns most of the power in the US it wouldn't surprise me in the least if there was an active NSA sponsored campaign to discredit Bitcoin in defense of the good ol' US dollar. [With the latest Snowden headlines about how agencies use online discussions to manipulate public attitudes about certain individuals]( (Google "astroturfing") it isn't a stretch to assume that similar manipulation occurs when dealing with other individuals and groups the FED deems dangerous to their interests.

0.001 BTC.  
Used Mt.Cocks once about 1.5 months ago. Moved .01 to see how quickly transactions were handled.  Did a little research and found out it was nearly impossible to transfer USD out from them.  Immediately moved my 0.01 BTC out, with a 0.001 BTC transfer fee.  Waited one month to get my account verified for nothing...
On the positive side, I feel like I've dodged a bullet.  Now I just need to wait and hold until my break-even price of $793 USD/BTC or greater before I make any more big decisions about my BTC...

Logarithmic scale.  It's a legit way to describe an exponential growth system.  You have to think more in terms of accumulated growth/decay percentages over time.
The difference between two days ago at the peak and now (at the time I write this post) is $1,235 down to $730, which would give you a 41% loss. This crash so far, for anyone who bought at $1,235 two days ago will have lost only $494, that is if you were to sell now.  The crash back in April was $260 down to $50, which would give you an %80 loss.  If you had invested $1,235 back then before the crash you would have lost $988. 
The numbers we're dealing might be bigger, but the loss in percentages is significantly less.

$872/btc here...
What ever.  I'm gunna hang on to it.  See what happens in a year.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:29:51
If it goes down to $200-$300/btc like some people are saying I'll buy some then too.  Crashes come and go.  I doubt this is "The Big One."

It's like having an off-duty cop drive at or below the speed limit during rush-hour on a one lane highway thus pissing off miles of traffic behind them.  Then the highway splits into two lanes and all the pissed-off traffic speeds ahead.  Then a whole squad of on-duty cops gets to catch speeders and make their month quota in 1/2 a day.
Herd the sheep.
