Yeah the guy’s a fucking moron. Feel bad for his kids. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:19:58
Lol so it’s backed by nothing. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:28:18
Lol good luck buddy...when the 95% of people who don’t want to break the law leave the room, what do you think happens to bitcoins price?
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:17:25
But that definitely doesn’t mean young people should go wild on bitcoin with half their investable assets. 10% of your investable monies, go for it. You won’t notice it a whole lot in 10 years if it busts.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:43:49
It’s pretty much the same concept. It’s referred to as “averaging down”
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:35:17
Lol not
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:48:41
Lol these are the people trading bitcoin. We’re hopeless you guys.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:19:19
Lol it’s not. If you knew anything about Buffett and what he is all about, you’d know it’s a criticism.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:01:57
Ever heard of “cherry picking”? Ya, you did that
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:25:50
The US government expects to be paid taxes on even illegal profits. Shit, they got Capone on tax evasion. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:11:28
But it’s only trading on CBOE right now. Why would any other exchange matter?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:23:56
Just because I don’t think it’s around for the long term doesn’t mean I know when it’s going sputter. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:23:09
Stores of value don’t fluctuate in value 25% in a day or 100% in a month. It’s the most extreme example of a speculative asset possibly ever. You’re way, way off-base.

If a portfolio full of US treasuries goes bust,  this guys going to have bigger problems. He sounds like he should have stayed in school.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:34:06
It means nothing. There is pretty much no way to value bitcoin other than making arbitrary comparisons to things like gold or silver. Looking at a chart and trying to guess the next move is essentially voodoo

That would just be dollar cost averaging. The “buy the dip” mentality is just an example of active investing. It’s really whatever’s best for you and what you believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:18
This is actually a good indicator of bitcoins actual potential. Ma and pa can barely type in google.com in the browser, no way they’re risking losing $1000’s by a typo with no recourse 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:56:39
Lol so what you’re saying is you come here for the confirmation bias.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:41:48
They do, just not in this toxic subreddit. A lot of people here will suffer greatly when it collapses to near nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:48:20
It’s not going to sit in cash for 17 years. It will likely be diversified in the 529 across several asset classes and geographically. Leaving it in bitcoin would be idiotic. This sub is toxic and will downvoted it, but in reality there’s a huge chance bitcoin will fail to be mass-adopted. The USD will be fine, the world relies on it, and we have an enormous military to protect our interests. It’s like everyone here is hoping for a doomsday scenario, it’s ridiculous and unrealistic.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:24
You obviously don’t know enough about it. Stay away.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:47:00
Its not hard to see, retard.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:46:42
Not really. A giant crash followed by a downward trend could very mean it is dead, that something better has arrived. If you truly believe bitcoin is going to be the end-all be-all, then sure go ahead, but don’t be surprised when it works its way back to zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:58:14
No. It won’t. Don’t be ignorant.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:57

Have fun riding the wave downward eventually, chief.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:35:07

Sears was king too. Enron was king. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:52:37
There not “buying up bitcoin” anyway. It’s literally just cash changing hands at settlement. No bitcoin is involved. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:48:13
That’s because a lot of people here are college-aged stoners with an interest in computers who pretend to be experts at economics and international trade.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:36:25
Yeah. These people hoping for the collapse of the “mainstream” economy do not understand what that will mean. Their cities will be rampant with crime, corruption, dramatically reduced services such as fire departments and waste disposal. It won’t be allowed to collapse. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:16:54
He’s an idiot. Plain and simple. If it hadn’t worked out you’d be saying the same. Investing 101, diversify and don’t risk so much that you’d have to dramatically alter your (family) lifestyle.

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:30:53
Boy you’re slow
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:06:26
Good for you. Store your value in bitcoin and have fun coming back to it ten years when it’s lost 99% of its value for any number of reasons. Inflation in the US has been what 1.5%? I’ll take that over storing my value in something that’ll probably lose 99% of its value before long. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:01:57
Or, you know, someone could give a simple summary of what he’s looking for.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:48:46
Well you were right at the time. Chances are if you would have bought back in at the bottom, you would have sold long before this recent rally out of boredom.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:00:15
That’s what a short is...selling a borrowed asset. So you have to buy that asset later to give back to the person who lent it to you. Holy shit there are people involved in this shit who shouldn’t be

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:02:03
It means you’re not educated enough in finance to be investing more than $10 worth of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:10:54
That’s great, you can look at a chart and see a trend. If you think 9 years is long enough to understand long term implications, you’re going to have a rough time. This is a brand new thing, most people just arrived. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:30:19
Lol. Having 15-20% of the transaction value wiped out before you can transfer it sounds pretty bad actually 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:00:03
You can use that logic for pretty much any period. “Who cares about an 80% crash, it’s still up 100% from 2014”
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:19:48
Lol have fun “protecting wealth” when your 1 bitcoin is worth a single can of corn. The markets decide its value, chief.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:03:12
Most of the people reading here don’t even know what that means, which is sad. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:53:20
Hahaha. So what you’re saying is that a stock has value, and bitcoin is based on nothing. You don’t even see the irony in your statement.

lol. Good luck with that.

@_date: 2017-12-11 01:26:50
Lol no they don’t, that’s not how an of this works. Futures are literally just priced at the current price plus a markup of the TVM. You need to do some more research on the financial universe. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:10:51
You are fucking retarded. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:48:22
Yeah I’m sorry but real whales own more  value in real estate and stocks then 99.9999% of bitcoiners will ever have value in bitcoin. I mean it’s fun to pretend and all, but be realistic. Most people don’t have enough discretionary to invest anything, most of the rest don’t invest enough, and the whales still control the market at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:35:53
If fiat won’t exist, you’re going to care less about bitcoin. There will be rioting, violence, and chaos. You’ll be lucky to just live through it.

Lol wtf. Why would you think fiat is backed by gold?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:19:11
Well, it can be. Futures are commonly used as a hedge, where you could have actual bitcoin and short futures, or you could just buy or sell a future on its on for exposure to price movements. It absolutely can be a bet on its future price. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:56:48
“Store of value” does not mean what you apparently believe it does...
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:39:10

Doesn’t matter. If demand plummets, POP.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:56:27
You sound like someone who read too much about “the technology”. Fact is, the next best crypto might be out there already. $250B market cap is NOTHING in the grand scheme of things. Hell, the US has almost $20T in debt alone. “Very unlikely it won’t take off”...such bullshit, it’s wayyyy more likely that it will crash at some point and fail to ever really recover. Depending where you got in, it might not matter to you. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:45:56
Fuel: Rampant speculation and likely manipulation 
Runs out when: governments prohibit converting to fiat. A better, quicker, more secure crypto takes over. People realize that it will never truly catch on for the mainstream. When enough exchange hacks erode confidence in it. When people realize you can’t hardly buy anything with it. The list is endless.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:00:09
This sub is essentially satire, in case newcomers don’t notice. The problem is that uneducated people come here and read that bitcoin is going to be worth $100k and take it as fact. Any negative views get downvoted to oblivion. In reality, bitcoin probably has a 5% chance of ever being worth 100k and a 95% chance of going back to $100 where a handful of diehards try to keep the dream alive. These arent hard numbers, obviously, but some posters need to remember that people will view their content as based on reality. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:29:37

Wtf are you talking about? How many bitcoins did the driver have?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:55:41
The future of bitcoin really doesn’t rely on the tech as much as it does mass adoption. The important question is how plausible is it that a large portion of the population will be able to figure out how to buy them, use them, and not have them stolen from an exchange. It’s out of the question to assume everyone will use a paper wallet when one character off will lose your coins forever. You can try to understand the tech all you want, but it’s not going to matter when there are other cryptos already with better infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:17:10
Well, you missed the point entirely 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:42:48
Lol. Just because it’s recovered before doesn’t mean it will recover after the next 90% drop

Holy shit you guys are either uneducated or ignorant. Do you think he’s going to leave it all in a bank account? Fuck no. He can leave it in a fucking CD if he wanted to be as safe as possible and that would at least keep up with inflation. OP said he’s going to invest it in index funds, which is pretty much the correct answer. In 17 years it’ll likely be worth at least double, and bitcoin will likely be worth nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:45:28
Exactly, who cares about what some old CS prof thinks? Bitcoins future is more of a Behavioral Finance, Economics, and finance question. The tech is great, but people act like bitcoin (the first popular iteration of the blockchain concept) will be the end-all, which is pretty much never how new technologies work.

Dumbest thing I’ve ever read. If you’ve already seen it going up every day, that is the worst time to buy. You buy when there is blood in the streets, and you sell when everyone else is in euphoria.

Or just not trying to catch the wave because of FOMO
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:26:09
That's exactly the opposite of conventional wisdom when you're bullish long term. You should buy in chunks on the way down. You just don't necessarily go all in because you think it bottomed, because chances are that you're wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:35:33
Good. Most people won't realize this sub is satire, at least then I don't have to witness the idiotic advice here.

Lol if it drops to 1000 this sub would use the same logic.

Lol this is this sub in a nutshell. Just buy it when it goes up again, he says. It's so simple!
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:49:56
It would basically amount to theft. I would think they could be charged with theft or fraud

Go ahead, hold your breath. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:08:36
This is beyond idiotic. For starters, any person with half a brain doesn’t keep money sitting under their mattress. Even at today’s historically low interest rates, $100 over 100 years would be around $270. At historically normal rates, $100 would be worth  around $3,200+ in 100 years. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:01:38
Except that $10 will buy $9.85. If you use a savings account, you’ll have $10.20. There you go, you just learned personal finance. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:02:50
Then don’t leave your money in straight cash like an idiot. Put it in an interest bearing account or cd’s or bonds. Don’t be an idiot
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:04:00
Lol watch their heads explode. If they think banks are fucking them (they’re not), wait till they find out what the Bitcoin whales are doing to them. Fucking dolts...
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:37:36
You’re an idiot. They’re all highlighting it’s volatility and or it’s nefarious purposes. Amazing how blind people like you are. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:17:56
Gold sucks. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:59:23
And that’s why you get paid $50,000 a year versus the $3,000 you might have gotten in 1913. The logic used to justify crypto currencies is getting comical. If you’re concerned about your savings, put it in bonds or CD’s... 
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:28:17
No way. You must be one of those Elliot wave nuts
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:05:26
Because it’s stable and accepted everywhere in the world. Nobody in the real world keeps dollar bills under their mattress. It is kept in accounts which outpace inflation. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:47:52
I think part of the problem is that technical analysis is garbage for anything other than very short timeframes. If someone says they can predict the price of bitcoin next week by looking at the charts, they’re just overly confident and probably full of themselves.
