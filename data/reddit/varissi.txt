Sir can you go and register? I add the private key. If you go to your profile and click on receive you will see the public and private key.
I will post the code on github. I hope some will have a way of validating it

Thanks for the valuable advice. I will make the private keys available for each user. So that they can have full controll of the wallet.
But let me explain something, user will put bitcoins on the wallet on my website only if they decide to purchase tickets for the contests. Tickets are not refundable. Once you purchase a ticket it will remain on your profile until you decide to join a contest. You cannot ask for refund for a ticket. This is why I thought that maybe not puting their private key will prevent hackers from having it. Also users will use the wallet carefully and only if they want pay for a ticket.
I will put the code on ghithub.
I'm trying to do whatever it takes to prove to people that this is not a scam. An thank you your comments, I m learning a lot.
Thank you Sir

I published the codeon github [
I think you did not get my point. I do not ask people to give their private keys. The website generates a new wallet for each user. That wallet shall be used for one thing: you send the amount to purchase tickets. It is not a personal wallet. It istheir to confirm the transaction and make things easier.

Dear Sir,
Thank you for the comment. This is not a scam. I used Bitcore\-lib, a Node.js module that is used to make transactions on the blockchaine and generate wallets with public key and private key. I use a module in Node.js called crypto in order to encrypt the fliipit wallet. Again your wallet on fliipit is used only for purchasing tickets.
You can create an account and see you wallet public address that you can follow on the blockchaine. 
I cannot post the code here since they containe the keys of the cyphers that I use for encrypting. But you can go and register and see how it works. If you think it is a scam please tell me what should I do in order to prove that it is not, because it is not.

 This wallet is used for one thing. Buying tickets. It is not meant to be you personal wallet. It is just a faster way to receive and confirm payments. 
Could you please help me open source it? What should I do?

I understand your concern. However, if you read the comments bellow you will see how transparent I'm. I'm just presenting a new website and you guys without even checking the website or asking relevant question are just throwing allegations.
I really hope that the website start working and people start talking about their earnings so that you see that not all new website are scams.
Thank you sir
