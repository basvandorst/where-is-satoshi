Not even close to true for silver.  Total amount of gold is worth significantly more than the total amount of silver.  
For copper we do mine more dollar-wise of it than gold... but copper is lost over time to landfills and oxidation.  Most of the gold that was ever mined is still in use today.

Every country that has experienced monetary collapse due to fiat currency, gold and silver prove their worth over and over.
The latest example being early 2000's in Zimbabwe.  People that didn't have gold were panning in the river for miniscule amounts of it to buy bread and supplies.  They weighed the gold dust by the 1/10th gram, no need for coins.
Keep an eye on Venezuela in the coming years

You should not be buying gold unless you understand why you should be buying it.  If you are looking for a quick buck then do not buy gold.  It is for long term monetary stability, not for profit.

Bitcoin is a great tool for a properly functioning society. When society breaks down you think you are going to walk into your local bakery and spend bitcoins?  You can barely do that now.
When many countries take a downturn they can't even keep the lights on and they experience rolling power blackouts.

Thats just simply not true.  Gold has gone through spikes because investors flock to it when there is turmoil in the world, but for the most part if you measure what 1oz of gold bought in the past vs what it buys today, more often than not its purchasing power will be higher today.
It doesn't follow inflation, There are too many factors involved.  But it does hold its value.
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:10:47
Ok So I keep repeating myself that gold is for preservation not for profiting... and people are coming back with "YEAH BUT GOLD BUYERS DIDN'T PROFIT MUCH"
Listen.  If your intention of buying gold is to profit, then do not buy gold.  You do not understand enough about money to realize why gold is important and how fragile our current fiat monetary system is.  
Gold is more like insurance than investment.

So profits are paid back to investors and losses are all eaten by the company.  There is no fucking way ever that this is a feasible business model.   
If you are going to scam people at least lie and tell them there is the small possibility of losing money.  Your current story is too good to be true, you're going to scare off some potential victims.
Edit: If this is your company and you think this idea works... Good for you on innovative thinking.  But if it takes off then your business expenses are going to get exponentially expensive and quick, more than you plan on.  Your plan may do well if bitcoin takes a forever upswing, but after a month or 6 of downturn its going to be hard to maintain those expenses.

If you don't like what Peter Schiff has said about bitcoin that is fine.  But don't try to mislead this community by making up garbage about him.
How could you even talk about Peter Schiffs record and conveniently ignore this:  (10 mins, excellent watch) 
Peter Schiff did correctly predict QE1-3 + operation twist.  He was correct about the gold spike, it came back down some but that doesn't take away that it happened.
Here is an amazing presentation Peter gave at the mortgage brokers conference in 2006 where he clearly lays out why the Realestate market is about to crash.  Spoiler: It did and for the exact reasons he says it did.
You won't watch it, but anyone who does can not deny that he saw it coming.

They did, and they are going to severely regret that decision. Just 4 years ago $1 US = $1 CAD.  Today $1 US = $1.33 CAD

That is a very gross oversimplification.   CPI is designed to adjust numbers to create a more favorable outlook than reality.  Shadowstats does use govt numbers but reworks the formulas by removing variables and tricks in the calculations.   Perfect? of course not, certainly more accurate.
Do you really believe the US official 4.7% Unemployment rate? Impossible considering 25% of households do not have a single employed member.  The government says that anyone unemployed for 1 year or more is no longer unemployed and are not factored in (see Discouraged Workers).  What a load of garbage.   Shadowstats fixes the governments corrupted formulas.

Also being able to see stop-losses allows for massive manipulation.  If I knew there were people lined up to sell at $700 .  If I had enough bitcoins i could unload all the way down to 700 and immediately buy them all back for less than I paid.

You can't just focus on this chart and say SGS is bullshit.  I agree that is the "laziest" calculated chart but that is the point of it.  It says in the title using 1990's CPI methodology, to undo the downward adjustment of 2.7% .  
Other charts like the 1980's based CPI methodology comparison show greater divergence.
And I am not saying that ShadowStats is perfect, their CPI calculations are probably the least accurate of the analysis they provide.  But even still it is more accurate than the official numbers.

Every year we hear of stories of systems "where it would take all the worlds supercomputer's 2000 years to crack the code"   I laugh when I hear nonsense like this because then a pimply faced highschool kid cracks it on the weekend. 
You are talking about pure processing power in a brute force attack, which is quite stupid, there are always better ways to hack.  You can put whatever level encryption you want and it doesn't even matter if you can figure out a way around it.
For Example:  Lets say that I know you have a bitcoin wallet.  So I put a keylogger on your computer, gain access to your computer, I know all your passwords now and can gain access to your wallet and take your bitcoins... A lot of good that encryption did

If you like bitcoins that is ok.  I'm just saying that I do not trust any monetary item without intrinsic value.  Especially anything completely digital.
Did you ever hear of the Stuxnet virus?  It was a virus that infiltrated Iran's national defense network, the virus routed itself to the nuclear facility, and was able to shut down room-sized underground cetrifuges that are used to enrich uranium.

You can buy bitcoins for purchases but dont ever use it as an investment.  Buy and get rid of them immediately.
Basically the people who got in early will be millionaires by selling to the people buying today, who will eventually lose it all.   The higher the bitcoin market cap is worth, the more incentive there is to steal and hack it.   It will happen eventually, and when it does you won't be able to give your bitcoins away.

Are you saying that the amount of total electricity spent will not always stay on trajectory to just below the total amount of money received from processing fees?  Yes it may fluctuate on a daily or weekly basis.
There is an additional issue with supply and demand for mining in that many people take advantage of others to get "free electricity".   These people do not care about their costs and will mine anyway 24/7 no matter the price.
I get what you are trying to prove from a purely technical aspect (and you are 100% correct), but in reality humans chase profits.  You can not stop more people from mining.   It is about supply and demand...  and that is how it works.

But you are ignoring supply and demand.  You are right and the solution is simple... all you need to do is just go tell 9/10ths of all miners to just stop mining.   Problem solved?
If price goes up there absolutely WILL be more miners due to simple supply and demand.   The amount people are spending on electricity will always balance out to just under the value you receive.  There will also be more miners as fees go up, and more transactions to process.   You absolutely can not ignore this and you dont get to say that bitcoin is the "future of money" while simultaneously saying it can all be handled with a fraction of the miners.

@_date: 2013-05-20 21:44:46
But if lets say there was a set of machines set up to transfer coins back and forth nonstop.  Wouldn't all of those millions/billions of transactions be logged and stored?
The scenario that I was envisioning wasn't destroying bitcoin or the network, Only to create so many transactions that the size of the blockchain grew to a size that was out of control.  50gb, 200gb, 10 tb? Is there a limit? 
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:17:28


That is the info that I am looking for.  I'm not trying to be frustrating, so thank you for being patient.
Let me rephrase my question.  Lets say that some hacker wanted to attack the blockchain and greatly grow its size in an attempt to shut it down temporarily or longer.
If he mines his own bitcoins, then uses a program to keep sending those coins back and forth between 2 accounts.  What measures are stopping him from being successful. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:39:34
Thanks that helps.
But I still don't get why If I am the sole original miner of a block.  I get 25 BTC.  I keep sending those and only those back and forth to myself.  Someone else gets transaction fees?   Even though I'm the miner and the only person who has ever touched those bitcoins.
Or does it not work like that either?
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:28:24
I'm getting confused because it seems like I am getting different info from everyone who responds.  I absolutely do not understand how it works, and that is why i am here to ask you guys.
You are saying that if I mine a block, and i get those 50 BTC (or whatever it is now).  All of those bitcoins are now in my wallet.  That if I try to transfer those to my other wallet, I only get a small fraction of those transaction fees even though I was the original miner?  Who gets the rest of them?
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:13:43
But you only need to the owner of a fraction of a block, if you keep passing that one fraction back and forth.
If I am the original miner of of 0.01 bitcoin, that is all i am talking about sending back and forth
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:13:58
So in the event that if someone wanted to intentionally grow the blockchain, this isn't a big issue because everyone could just go out and buy cheap hard-drives? 
That is not quite the answer that I was hoping for.
For me, downloading the blockchain is a bigger issue than storing the blockchain.  I'm sure most of you guys have high-speed internet, but not everyone does.
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:57:14
I would like to know more about how this maximum size per block and the limit works.  To me any kind of unlimited growth is seen as a risk area, that could be exploited.   
I was under the impression that if bitcoins were sent from one user to another, those transactions are always stored in the blockchain.  That is a feature and function at the heart of how bitcoin works.  So if there are size limits on that, I'm not understanding how bitcoin can keep track of every transaction and also limit the size of it.
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:59:29
So as long as I was shuffeling around bitcoins that I mined, the transaction fees would always come back to me?
I'm not expecting it to work this way, I'm just trying to get a grasp on how it works and why I should not be worried.
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:48:53
Im not sure what that exactly means, So for each block, it will keep track of the transactions until it reaches the size of 1MB, and then it no longer stores it?
Who gets the transaction fees?
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:09:38
If the person was spamming the blockchain between 2 of their own accounts using bitcoins mined by the user himself.
Do the transactions fees keep coming back?
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:31:31
I believe the piece of the puzzle that I am missing is this...
If I mine the bitcoins, and I send them to another wallet of mine.  How am I incurring a loss? It seems like all of the transaction fees would come back to myself and I would have neither gained nor loss, and only transferred coins.
