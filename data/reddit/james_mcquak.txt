The difference is the show would be directly handing the money to you. 
It's a bit pompous to claim credit for making someone a millionaire when the money didn't come from Roger. I might as well claim credit myself because if I had killed a butterfly twenty years ago everything might be different.

They not teach reading in law school? 
It's an area left up to the states but most states do have some laws about it.

The reason some people are angry with the IRS is that they are taking notice and adapting. Some people thought cyprocurrency would be a way to avoid paying taxes and now it's becoming clear that governments aren't going to allow that.

Tether combines the secrecy and lack of regulation of cryptocurrencies with the trust and infinite printing ability of fiat currencies. 
Imagine if Bank of America said "Hey want to buy Bank of America dollars for $1? We don't guarantee you will actually be able to exchange them back to USD, we are operating this venture outside of regulatory oversight, and we reserve the right to print more bank of America dollars at any time." Would you be interested in holding these Bank of America dollars? I certainly wouldn't.
Don't miss the same red flags just because tether is digital.

Yes it is. Stores just either meet the bare minimum legal requirements for how long items have to be at the higher prices or they gamble that no one is enforcing these laws.

If the concern is not letting people know he had money stashed for safety purposes then giving away the money he just publicly received would put public knowledge of his finances back to where it was a few weeks ago.
If the concern is PR then it would be hard to turn giving to charity into bad PR unless the charity turns out to be a scam.

If he doesn't want or need it then he can publicly give it to a charity.
