Criminal cases need to prove a crime was committed. Civil cases (like this one) merely need to demonstrate damage to the plaintiff.

Sounds good to me. Let's do bunch of cans and I'll give some out to my beer nerd friends for xmas. 
You mind using a bitcoin escrow since I don't know you? I'll pay the 1.5% fee.

Ah, whatever you did worked. Submitted successfully. Thanks a bunch! I was looking for somewhere to post since coinmap only takes brick and mortar businesses and we work exclusively online. Great service.

Such a good beer! How much?

I have had good transactions with them. I actually ran into the problem people complain about (flagged as high risk and had my transaction cancelled), but after emailing them they reinstated the buy at the original price even though it had more than doubled since then.
It's a website, so it's not 100% secure. If you're worried, use it for purchasing, then transfer your coins to your wallet. Other that in person purchasing like on localbitcoins, I don't think there's an easier way to acquire BTC at the moment.

I haven't cashed out so I don't know. I'm buying solely for the long term and some smaller purchases in BTC.
As far as how long it takes to get BTC in your account once you're verified? I looked at my transaction history and it was either 1 or 2 days for all my transactions. Keep in mind that they've had issues with running out of coins during super high volume days, so look for a warning that your buy orders will be executed a few days later **and at that future day's market rate**. Basically, just read everything very carefully.

Again, totally agree. Very good points. I do realize that it would be literally impossible to shut down a peer to peer protocol, in the US or elsewhere. What I was speculating about is what alluded to below - monitoring bitcoin traffic somehow (again, maybe impossible I don't know) and then attempting to force the citizen to relinquish the coins or trade in for fiat or some US crypto-currency.
I know bitcoin is very resilient, but I think that for it to be hugely successful, it's going to have to be adopted by lots of very non technical end users. And I wonder if they could be at risk in this scenario. Heck, I consider myself fairly well informed on technology *for the average person*, and I've had a hard time figuring out some of the basics of purchasing and securing bitcoin. Still learning, actually.

I don't know if this is a repost, but I find it really interesting to read the discussion of the pros and cons of Bitcoin between its creator and the other cryptology folk on this mailing list, especially from the distant historical perspective where were are currently seeing increased adoption and massive fluctuation in value.
Here is a particularly prescient comment in the [thread](

Totally. But do you think that future success of bitcoin requires soccer moms and mechanics to be able to use it? If so then I think it's a fair question. If it stays fringe then obviously its a non issue.

Yes. It started off an exchange for Magic The Gathering trading cards, hence the name. **M**agic **T**he **G**athering **O**nline e**X**change.

Please, at least make it an option. There are lots of us who would be happy to pay those small fees to contribute to the growth of merchant adoption. 
That's the selfless reason. There is also a selfish reasoning for wanting this option. Merchant adoption and the accompanying news raise the value of bitcoin. If we can spend and help to raise the price without losing long term holdings we will be contributing to long term value increase. I swear, your customers will love this.

What if the app stores 10 prints and requires min 5 to send? You could lose a hand or even suffer bad burns on one hand or parts of both. 
You could also have a joint account this way to allow purchase only with both account holders present. Maybe it holds 20 prints but requires 11 to send. 
I mean really, how often does someone lose or disfigure both hands? Exceedingly rare.

I'm in San Diego. If a million to one you happen to be a musician we could do business. 
No pizza truck though :(

Yeah , I know nothing about cryptography, it was just an idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:03:01
There is. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:05:00
I agree with your point. The reason I posed the question is not whether bitcoin can compete, but rather on some sort of future enforcement against bitcoin holdings (obviously US only and I'm not sure how they'd enforce it). 
The point is, at one point in recent US history the government outlawed holding gold above a certain amount. If it becomes apparent that US citizens are holding bitcoin as a reserve against monetary policy, what would happen if the US found a way to force its citizens away from bitcoin in some way? 
Maybe it's not possible, but I think the comparison to the gold confiscation is worth looking at.

Found someone a half mile from me on that site. I'll be going to buy tomorrow! What a great resource.

I love the idea. However, I spent a fair amount of time trying to add my business, meeting error after error. Most of them were with image size or type, but once I got that right, it keeps giving me this error:
