After looking more into the cards, it seems like the card is a prepaid card, which ANX load for us, whenever we deposit bitcoins. But the thing is, its a mastercard. My theory is the card try to use credit and not checking. In my country we dont have that option, it goes directly to checking or credit, but since its a mastercard card, I think the issue is there, or the card have no funds.

Why being such a jerk?
I activated my account, with a code I received with the cards. That code was apart from the cards, to activate the main account.
Im asking, do I have to send my pin number(the one you use for purchase) to get my card activated?
And no, I have not thrown away any thing

I have the premium card.
In some countries you have to chose to pay from debit/checking right? But in my country, you dont get that chose, it goes directly from your checking account.
So im helpless here. Since I cant find any phone number to ANX only email!

Its the premium.
The card is brand new, I have never used it succesfully. Im located in EU

What? Where?

My card is getting declined, everywhere. Even online.
Support telling me they dont know what the problem is... 
The way I deposited, was clicked on the debit card on their page, then transfered to the BTC wallet on the page. 2 days after it was confirmed, but im still getting declined everywhere I try it

Thanks, I have been calling that number without any luck, its duo to the time difference. 
I want to talk to support, this store cant help me, im pretty sure of that.
Do you have the card?
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:28:25
Support is very helpfull, they speak perfect english too, so its nothing there. I ordered 1 premium and paid express, they sent me 2 premium cards, which is good!
But I have been having problems since I received the card, last week. 
I made a deposit to test the card the first day, and after 2 days(friday) they emailed me to confirm my account.. Which is very weird, since I had to confirm it with a pin I got with the cards. Support apologized for the misinformation and said I should be able to use the funds on monday(this week) after I got declined in various shops and ATM I have been talking with support through mail. But its like you said, the time difference is a heck to work around.
I have a payment I need to make within tomorrow, and it have been planned for two weeks, and the card is still not working...
EDIT: The shipment was very fast, it took around 2-3 business days before I had it in my hands

I cant see my balance. Where can I do that?
I think the balance is only available for basic cards, not premium
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:52:00
It didnt give me any options at the ATM. I have lurked the site to find my balance without any luck. I think its a feuture they that is coming soon.
I will most def update this and ping you if things get any better.

Why are you so mad?
Im asking simple questions.
Do I have to send the pin number for my card to get it activated?
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:33:26
The card is pretty cheap, the expensive part is the shipping. The shipping cost more then both cards(or I think I was lucky, since BTC just dropped when I ordered and they did not update it)
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:21:47
The same pin you use to confirm a purchase?
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:56:04
If you used some time to read what I wrote to the other user about their service, your mouth wouldnt be in your ass.
Then how do you withdraw from ATM if you dont need a pin? Everywhere I have tried this card, I have been asked for a pin.
Anyway, just sent anxint my pin number. 
Do you know how long before the card is active? I have already balance in the card.
