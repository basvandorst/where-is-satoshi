Why do you think so? Just genuinely curious.  
  
The fact is, my parents don’t need to know what lightning is at all, they just need someone to tell them the correct wallet app to download to make cheap btc txs.  I don’t suspect in the future very many people will know what lightning is at all, it’ll just be integrated into every wallet worth a damn.  
  
There is already testing on mainnet, lightning charge which gives retailers the ability to accept ⚡️ BTC already, and i just read a thread where two pizza shop owners in LA were setting it up to do real world testing. I give it a few months max. Maybe i’m wrong, we’ll see!

Precisely! I think for a lot of people throwing thousands of dollars into cold storage, while perfectly secure, is a bit nerve racking. Wouldn’t it suck to find a year down the line someone frauded the wallet and took the funds? (think about use cases: angry spouse, junky children, thieves that find your private keys).  
  
Blockfolio and many other wallets do “watch only” addresses via block explorer, but there isn’t an app that will do this for the big 3 currencies at once. It would be nice to see your portfolio of cryptos, know the value of your wallets, and be able to check that they haven’t been tampered with.

You should add a feature that will use block explorer to monitor a specific wallet address.  So that way you can monitor exactly how much coin your different wallets have.  This is also a nice feature bc if you have a cold wallet you can monitor it for activity.

I’m not a dev but the fact that there are still devs working on bitcoin lead me to believe they think it’s worth their time. I highly doubt the devs at bitcoin are just completely ignorant of the tech behind other coins. If monero was what seemed to be most effective and btc really sucked, dont you think devs would abandon it and jump ship? Follow the devs.

You’re missing my point. I said if monero or any other coin, for example, were the coin with the best tech, and bitcoin was actually useless, why would devs continue to work on the btc project?  They could have sold their shares at 20k, been rich, and moved on to coding the next best coin. Who cares if dumping shares tanks the price they would be so filthy rich anyway.  Obviously the devs see enough potential in btc to continue working on it. People like you and me aren’t devs, we don’t know what’s possible with the technology on a deep level (layer 2/3 possibilities, etc). Its best we listen to devs and not pretend like we know what we’re talking about.

I appreciate the info but i would say the analogy isn’t the best, but i understand what you’re getting at. Enron was a complex organization and not every moving part was aware of what it was doing in the shadows.  But anyway, you’re essentially saying “i have no clue why these idiots are still pursuing bitcoin development, except for financial reasons.” It’s a fare judgement and i respect it, but it doesn’t add up for me. If you’re a responsible investor/dev with huge amounts of btc you would be taking incremental profits throughout this whole 2017 upswing.

Don't sell.  If you're playing around with money you legitimately can't afford to lose (you shouldn't be), then at least only play with money you don't immediately need and can at least hang on to.  Don't sell, that's when you realize losses.  Bitcoin has been doing this for 10 years and it will do it again, harder and faster.  If you bought in at 8k and sold at 4k, you could have just let your investment ride and not taken a loss.  Even if you've got too much money wrapped up in crypto for 2 years, you're still going to make unreal gains compared to any other investment, period.  Average in and average out.

That's the American version of life and happiness. Go out and see the world, don't wait until your 60 to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:08:29
I completely agree.  But in America I think the illusion is to retire at 62 and then see the world, but by then, most people are set in their ways and have lost the hunger to really experience the human condition.  People, like I did, fear the hole in their resume, where as Europeans appreciate and encourage a gap year.  That's what I've heard at least.  Very few people I know in the US have any motivation to see and experience the world.
  
So I agree on both sides.  But experiencing other cultures for more than just a two week vacation will greatly expand your mind and help you understand more about life, the world, etc.

I dont know, man. Im willing to say i am wrong but her demeanor on the Lets Talk Bitcoin podcast basically seemed to state that its cool to use, but dont go to the devs asking where your lost funds are, and be prepared to lose money when changes are released. She had a relaxed tone and wasnt pleading for people to stay off it. Andreas was there too and he even told her he’d been using it and had a node running, she enjoyed it. So where is the problem?  
  
I think more or less she just wants ppl to know that it wont speed up the process of adoption bu using it in beta. She thinks ppl have a few wrong ideas about what using it means, but isnt telling people not to use it.

@_date: 2018-02-21 05:15:08
i've considered it. not a smart move but, sometimes there are the right opportunities.  i would probably wait until i saw actual adoption and functionality as big online stores start accepting, then try to ride that wave up, of course for far less gainz.  but it is still a gamble as something game changing can still happen.  so, as the law of the universe dictates: the most gains are where there is the most risk. probably not a good idea to bet the house on it, but hey more power to you.

i think bitcoin is centered around devs doing work for btc.  if someone wants to, presumably, waste their time making ticker apps, i implore it.

I tried to tell you what stark and andreas said themselves on the podcast. Devs telling ppl not to use it were more or less telling people “dont file a report when your money is lost or come to us with bogus bugs we already know about”

Also, this community doesnt give a fuck about FUD, we just dont want to see it posted here bc its annoying to sift through. The other community cares about FUD, mass adoption, headlines and what effect on mass adoption they will have, etc.  
  
Your posts are telling. No need to keep this discourse going.

I'm curious why more people don't talk about this.  It seems as though he is dead and gone, and the keys locked away and the coins are lost, but what if they weren't?  How will we expect mass adoption when the public finds that out?  Honest questions.
