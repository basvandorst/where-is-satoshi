If you're so inclined, take a look at any of the darknet markets. There's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of products, reviews, sellers. Loads of people are buying and selling stuff with cryptos there, and 2010-2013 those were really the only people for the most part buying and selling with cryptos. Not just that, but they were using them because they HAD/HAVE to- because cryptos are/were much better in this way than fiat alternatives- not because they WANT to which is the reason many of the other users do.
Cryptos and online blackmarkets were made for each other

Yeah I really should have explicitly said I could be wrong or something. Oh look I did isn't that funny.
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:02:48
You guys must live a pretty enfeebled life if you're so desperate to prove someone wrong that you'll snatch the chance *even when someone said they were wrong themselves along with 3 others*. Like, congratulations you looked at an app good job.

processing gold on the moon would be impossible, and anyone who even dares to contradict my argument clearly doesn't understand lunar processing facilities
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:48:37
I sort of thought so but 4 people had responded telling me off for being wrong (pretty pathetic in my opinion, like you say it wasn't very long since it was at that number and I had said myself it was different now) so thought it better to concede defeat. Crazy how volatile the market is though, if it's at the market cap people are saying it is.
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:59:37
Well yeah this maybe two years ago which is like centuries in the crypto market.

3 trillion is an extremely outlandish number, like what you'd use to describe a country's GDP. it sounds like they're using it specifically to filter out the interest of anyone who understands things enough to not get scammed at all, it's the Nigerian prince tactic. 
Edit: Spain, for example, their GDP is $1.2 trillion, and I think the entire crypto market is around $100 billion (it's not that now I'm sure but it was last time I was paying much attention)
@_date: 2015-05-24 12:46:53
It wasn't.

He didn't.

Or, you know, because (assumably) you haven't tried to publicise yourself enough.

He really needs to work on his swing, that kind of bashing isn't going to be doing his lower back much good.

Like turn it into another currency? Yeah you can sell it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:36:04
Yep, or that. But not all of us are lucky enough to have one local :(
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:02:25
Last year, you could have gotten 20 for the same price one costs now! And those'd be worth $140k now :/
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:36:18
No, that means 2 * 50... it's only $100

You ever consider that drawing a conclusion on interpretation can lead to wild inaccuracies?
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:02:48
Yeah I agree with you really, but can't help thinking "if only" sometimes aha.

You won't be better we'll be better
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:52:47
Yep, in almost all cases, anyone who is interested in a topic will be able to find a lot of inaccuracies with mainstream programmes made about that topic. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:23:49
You could me, to be honest

can you help us out with this?
@_date: 2015-11-07 02:53:04
Oh we're going to need some very heavy duty ones for this. Maybe some of the classic E models and then the X models, please.
@_date: 2015-11-07 02:19:35
might be worth trying?
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:06:03
Thanks, they'll do fine.
I'll try and get a check to you as soon as possible. I'd pay with cash but my wallet was stolen when in was holidaying in Lima last week. I could also pay with Bitcoin which would be very appropriate.
@_date: 2016-05-04 12:44:11
It's a niche subject but most people know what Bitcoin is, that it's some kind of virtual currency, so it has some significance. But even besides that, the BBC is always portrayed as a decent source for news and doesn't resort to clickbaity articles or simply lying about things. This is quite disappointing.
@_date: 2016-05-05 02:29:23
Well that's really fucking unlucky.
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:45:49
Damn dude that's a lot of money, sorry that happened

Really just anarchocap which is anarchism with a monocle  
@_date: 2016-05-09 18:39:21
Despite all of his economic theories Friedman never managed to figure out that *all* economic issues can be solved by simply printing more money. So obvious.
