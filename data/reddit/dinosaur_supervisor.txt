It just sucks to be sharing personal space with unknown people. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:12:28
And then how do you convert it to dollars?
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:25:26
Where? 
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:42:08
Everything is priced in. If a large holder starts dumping, you'll see a downtrend. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 11:37:47
It's a pump and dump scheme, so far.
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:37:40
Value is in the eyes of the beholder.
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:36:57
You are looking at the past. Confirmation bias.
@_date: 2015-12-27 11:41:56
That's just a graphical representation of inflation, and a bad one.
@_date: 2015-12-27 11:37:07
That's a fair point. Not to say that in most markets, selling a big amount of coins would hit the order book like an atomic bomb.
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:47:03
Does it matter? No. It's completely irrelevant.

I've been hearing similar predictions since forever. "Banks will lose ground, banks are going to face losses, etc", but they always succeed in becoming stronger and strengthening market share. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 11:22:22
Disgusting. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 00:28:55
What? It's wrong to steal small amounts but it's OK to steal millions because politicians supposedly do  and get away with it?

Since when a single year's inflation rate predicts future rates? Since when bitcoin price is guaranteed to appreciate above inflation rates in any one-year period? 
@_date: 2016-02-17 04:11:58
Yeah, but what about the slippage cost? 
@_date: 2016-02-14 10:05:05
This guy is trolling non-stop, everyday.

Until we have robots occupying government chairs, there will always be some level of corruption. That's inherent to humanity. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 08:39:36
It's just about not panic-selling if price drops. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 14:18:22
There's no "undervalued" in currencies.
@_date: 2015-11-01 09:25:54
Trading solves that issue. Just like currency is traded for goods and is not infinitely accumulated. If the supply becomes extremely low, price will skyrocket and people will be unwilling to pay such high prices, thereby bringing the price down. Eventually offer and demand will be balanced inside a range much like pair of currencies and long term strategies will become less appealing, just like it happens with currencies.

As a Brazilian, this is not good, not good at all. This country wants to control everything and everyone, it's not like the US, although both are democracies and people are technically free. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:36:45
Usd is basically the reference currency, the same way commodities work. Round numbers are not something I like in price action anyway, the most important is that it broke a price *range* with heavy volume and very strongly. We should expect a pullback by now, I'll be coming back when the hourly chart starts trending up again, preferably above the 200 periods moving average. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:49:16
They also steal from citizens.

@_date: 2015-11-05 08:47:44
No. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:28:06
Liquidity: I can sell or buy immediately with little to no price slippage, except of course for moments of extreme volatility. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:40:52
Yeah. Tried metatrader 4 today, I'm disappointed with the ask/bid spread. Maybe because it's weekend? This spread is prohibitive to daytrading.
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:28:57
I see. Yes, it's btce. Thanks.
