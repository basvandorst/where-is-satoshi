This has been refuted. u/rudd-x made ridiculous assumptions in setting his parameters. Pure FUD inside and out.
hyc_symas did the LMDB work on monero and smooth is a core dev btw.
Whole thread for reference as additional comments from the devs are coming:

The concept of taint is that some coins can become distinguished from others based on their history. There's no such thing as "Monero as a whole will just become fully tainted." because they are fungible. The concept of taint doesn't even apply. That means EVERY COIN IS INTERCHANGEABLE AND THE EXACT SAME WITH NO DISTINGUISHING FEATURES. This is a FUNDAMENTAL NECESSITY of sound money.

Hard forks are built into the Monero protocol. They happen automatically on a 6 month rolling basis.

Actually several people have shared my sentiment and the only one to claim I am trolling is you. In fact several have called you out for being a troll. Anyways, this is boring. Your calculations have already been corrected by others and you still refuse to accept that your assumptions are poorly made, the charts misleading and conclusions incorrect. All you seem capable of now is slinging insults. Enjoy yourself.

The rationalisation going on in here from all the bitcoin maximalists is hilarious. Talk about mental gymnastics. Your lunch is getting eaten by superior cryptocurrencies. Give your core devs and blockstream a big high-five for that one.

Still has fees, long wait times, maybe no other participants for the amount you need to mix and is not really private in comparison. Coinjoin has it's own problems: 
ANd blockchain analysis isn't small time anymore: 
It's a kludge. Monero's combination of Stealth addresses, ring signatures, one time addresses and soon Ring Confidential Transactions is unbeatable by anything that currently exists.

Coinjoin can have it's own problems. 
It really doesn't touch the tech that Monero uses.

Confirmed talking straight out of your ass.

Ok... I can see why you didn't last at google. Anyways, take care friend.

There are decentralized exchanges emerging. bitsquare.io


Some things are worth the cost. For DNM's and such it certainly beats having your BTC transactions deanonymized and getting arrested. Even for just regular protecting of ones right to privacy it is worth it. Additionally, mixing costs fees, takes waaay more time, effort and technical know how and also isn't really that private:

Maybe you don't know how this works. If you reply to me, it is an invitation for me to reply back. That's how a conversation works. If you're done, stop posting. All of my posts were responses to comments you made DIRECTLY to me. It just so happens that the singular answer applied to all 7 of them. That is not stalking. You are dramatic and off your hinge buddy.
@_date: 2016-08-24 13:55:01
No. There are now decentralised exchanges. bitsquare.io

Lets have the data for these assumptions posted clearly in this thread and not expect people to go clicking shady links and downloading shady files. Your whole argument is predicated on these assumptions so it's important to have them out in the open.
    
EDIT: I'll go ahead and preempt you refusing to post the data as you did in the other thread:
So you spent countless hours today defending your position, calculating, making graphs, etc, etc but it's too much work to present the data that your argument hinges on in a safe and accessible manner? Here, I'll make it easy for you:

This is trolling bullshit. Fluffypony already told you that a light client can be made where it connects to a node remotely and pulls in a random set to mix with. It is a different solution to how bitcoin light wallets work. There are always trade off's but it is arguably better in a multitude of ways. Two off the top of my head being that it protects the users privacy and it has a positive effect towards maintaining a healthy node count/distribution. Additionally, it's early days for Monero and various other solutions are no doubt to emerge.

It would still be possible to know the coins were used on the sidechain. And if that persons identity is known and linked to those bitcoins then it will be known that person sent their bitcoins to MWchain. The mainchain is still transparent so this also essentially gives those bitcoins a new kind of MWtaint when they are unlocked back on the mainchain.

Private, fungible, scalable money. DOA because light wallet maybe be technically difficult. Ok sure...

You came to this sub making claims and you want me to do your work for you? If the barrier is so small why haven't you done it already? I have nothing to defend here. I'm not the one making these claims. You posted the file on a dicey looking site. Get over your moral dilema with google, post it somewhere legit and this pointless back and forth is over.
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:52:16
So spin it off then. Let me us all know how that goes for you.
By that logic Bitcoin can just be "spun-off" from the worlds fiat balances.
@_date: 2016-08-24 17:07:27


That is not the case here at all. Bitcoins lack of privacy, fungibility, static tiny blocksize, are all HUGE deficiencies that Monero solves. That is one coin solving a multitude of serious problems. Not "infinitely new coins everytime someone has a new idea".
EDIT: Additionally, regarding coinjoin and joinmarket: 








And as far as utxo, it's a tradeoff. There will come optiizations no doubt, along with the exponential advancement that technology follows. Additionally regarding DB performance:

Yes and in addition it will also increase the anonymity set considerably because with RingCT outputs can be used to mix as well.
