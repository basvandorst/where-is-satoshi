"m" is a cross-unit prefix meaning "mili" or "1/1000". It applises to watts, volts, kilograms, liters, ampers, and any other unit you wish. It's the standard world-wide way of saying "1/1000", the same way "k" is the world-wide way of saying "1000". Therefore it doesn't make sense bitcoin to go it's own way like Imperial units do.

They don't, because porn is just one of the many things you can get on them. But nowadays, the way many, many people see it, the only think you can get with bitcoins is illegal stuff on the silk road. That's already a bad image without adding porn.

I'm not sure it's convinient that people asociate Bitcoins with porn.
I know anything that adds users is good for Bitcoin. Just not sure it's good for the short-term.

But what's the need for that? I can just say "I have 10 mBTC". That makes perfect sense. 
Maybe this is because in the US and UK you put the currency symbol *before* the amount, which I find strange as you never say "I have the amount of dollars 3". 
But well, it's a proposition, it's well written, and well exposed. I hope the relevant people see it and consider it.

Well, you wouldn't say "em bee tee cee", you'd say "milibitcoin". Which is longer than your proposal, but universally understandable.

The M for million is capital, the m for mili isn't. 
So, 10e+6 would be 10 MBTC (megabitcoins) or 10M BTC (10 million bitcoins)
