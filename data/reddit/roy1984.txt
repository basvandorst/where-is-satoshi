It's a good idea because bitcoin is a great investment. It's a bad idea because you are a gambler and you will become a day trader and lose bitcoins even some people who HODL will get 100x returns.
My advice:
Stop being a gambler, educate yourself about Bitcoin, how to use it, how to use it safe &lt;hold your keeeeeyyyyysssss broooooo&gt; and of course educate yourself about money (so you will uderstand why Bitcoin has a value and money NOT (zero dude, it's worth nothing, money is debt)

Thanks bro, I am happy there are at least few people who can think. Anyway I don't care about NPCs and their downvotes. it tells more about them than about me. One example from my life is that I don't eat meat and diary products, I eat healthy food, live healthy and do a lot of sports. The irony is that I get advices what to eat and I am criticized by my parents and grandparents who are all fat and have diabetes. Sometimes I think about it and I think that people mostly deserved such a shitty treatment by the world leaders and rulers. I mean if they like constantly to swim in deep shit, so be it.

What we need is DECENTRALIZATION, that's the most important thing.
Decentralized and cashless, that's the win win solution.
A centralized  cashless society would be a disaster.

@_date: 2018-09-17 09:29:59
You didn't understand Bitcoin and how the blockchain which it uses works.
Here's one of the best blockchain explanations:
If you want to understand it I highly recommend it to you.
By banks you can trust just the CEO and maybe a few people who are in charge for the money, they can do what they want with your money.
When we speak about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which are using the blockchain you trust the miners and nodes (there are thousands of miners and nodes in the world and they all check the transactions and update the ledger).
So is it better to trust a few bankers than to trust thousands of miners and nodes.
And keep in mind that blockchain has it's own rules and you can't cheat on it, you can't shut it down (if you want to shut it down you need to shut down the internet completely which wont happen). It works like torrent, similarly and that's why nobody can shut it down.
Hope you get the point now

This could be good for cryptos to grow big again very fast

You aren't logic minded enough to understand cryptocurrencies, good luck with that
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:52:54
I am trying to find REALLY DECENTRALIZED cryptos that really make some sense and then be part of history. Bitcoin is still good, also Monero and Zcash, but there is still space for improvements.
PS If someone knows a more decentralized crypto than those 3, please tell me, I would be grateful to support them.

Just keep HODL, sooner or later it will happen, everyone who understands how bitcoin works, knows it's currently the far best solution.

He predicted $10k BTC by end of 2018 not $100k, so he was right
@_date: 2019-03-24 22:14:26
PoS could be technically in some way even more decentralized than PoW. Again, Bitcoin is far away the best option and even in my portfolio are mostly bitcoins (90%), but there is always something new you could create that didn't exist.

We have a problem

That explains why there are a lot of people who believe that Bitcoin is bad. I mean 30% of US and in world generally are wallies and plonkers.

He is talking about what could happen if Bitcoin becomes something like gold or world reserve currency.
There is the word COULD not WILL in the title.
@_date: 2019-03-24 20:57:08
Well, I agree Bitcoin is  but there are a few other cryptocurrencies which are worth of attention like for example Monero, Zcash or Ethereum. I think that know most of cryptos are shitcoins (let's say 99% or even more), but the rest are good projects. Blockchain as a protection for systems will play a big role to. All that cryptos and blockchain of course was created with Bitcoin so you should be careful by saying cryptos and blockchain suck or something like that.

It should be helpful for beginners.
@_date: 2019-08-21 11:28:03
Now I got a new better idea. I will just update my plan and instead of using a "secure" hardware wallet hire a math genius to create the private keys, the public address and the seed phrase. He would do it on a paper and then I would kill him xD
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:00:25
Yeah exactly :D

@_date: 2019-08-21 13:04:07
I don't think they can figure out. Most crypto holders even don't know what is a seed phrase, because they don't own their bitcoins. How do you expect regular people can know it. And if they heard for a seed phrase, do you really think they would connect it? I doubt.
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:03:50
They give away some amount of bitcoin when you play it.
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:08:06
Oh thank you. Now I have a new update:
Forget the dogs. I adopt 12 children and give them new names or nicknames. The oldest has the 1st seed phrase name, 2nd oldest 2nd seed phrase name, 3rd oldest 3rd seed phrase name...
Hack it now dudes :D
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:42:44
Yes. They can also try to figure out how to make gold or where is God and how the first humans appeared.
Or reverse the SHA 256 algorithm.
@_date: 2019-10-20 11:32:37
Yes, that's what most of these trolls don't know. When I say this to a Bitcoin hater s/he don't know what to say or just continues to troll without any reason.

@_date: 2019-10-20 11:04:17
You don't need to carry your bitcoins in your phone or any device. You can create bitcoin addresses offline and then export your keys on a physical paper which you can put in your fu*king wallet or wherever you want, in a safe, under a mattress, in your asshole, etc.. If you are mega sceptical it is even possible to create a bitcoin address just using math on a paper. Surprised huh? That's when you judge about something you don't know.

@_date: 2018-11-04 11:22:32
 I am pretty sure you have no idea what is Bitcoin and how it works. I could bet that you just heard stories from government trolls calling it a bubble. That's the trolled people's opinion about Bitcoin: Bitcoin=cryptocurrency, bubble, scam and only criminals use it, unlike fiat money which is used exclusively for good purposes. People are just lazy to study it so they get fooled by governments. So my advice, stop getting fooled, STUDY IT! 
@_date: 2019-01-03 12:48:31
Yeah, you are right, he is a fraud. But beside that, this topic about Bitcoin energy consumption is quite interesting. So many people talk about Bitcoin mining energy consuption calling it horrible and nobody talks about, for example, Google data mining energy consuption, or Whatsapp data mining energy consuption. We have double standards here.
@_date: 2018-11-06 13:17:37

They explained there how banks work and what happened in 2008 with banks.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:24:13
Yeah, but the real reason why they can't pay you 5k in bills is they don't have that money in any form. I think the world banks don't own more than 25% of money that they are supposed to own. They just sell ton of suspicious obligations for which they didn't receive any money and that's our big problem.
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:45:20
1. Yeah, the news are stale, but I feel like we miss that event to easy
2. And why they have always limits? Think about it. Go deeper inside the system
3. "Bitcoin financial institutions are no better than fiat-currency financial institutions."
There are no Bitcoin financial intitutions.
You should know at least that exchanges aren't Bitcoin institutions.
You can buy and sell bitcoins there, and also buy and sell dollars, euros...

Right man! Most people can't realize that, and that's why most people always lose in the game called "Who owes whom". Money is debt, and debt is generated by those big banks, so if you want financial freedom you need to be financially literate and have a high FQ in order to play their game successfully. Keep in mind, money is imaginary, it's just an idea.
