“LMAO” 
It’s almost like you are retarded and missed the fact that I said I’d like to move to a different exchange and start physically owning it.... weird.
@_date: 2019-07-18 06:24:01
Literally not a scam. I’ve never done this before and I would like to insure I’m doing this right before I go dump a shitload of money into a BTC atm on Friday. I just bought a ledger nano X and after struggling to get it paired to my phone for 3 hours I finally got it setup and I’d like to confirm that what I doing to generate a public key is correct. However believe what you want. That is within your own rights.
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:39:48
Thank you for actually being helpful. What exchange would you recommend for buying bitcoin that is user friendly and has decent charting tools. You know basic candle stick info and volume.. etc. I’m aware the robinhood isn’t actually bitcoin that I can withdraw into a ledger. I’ve just been trading it and making profit. Adding to what my “holdings” are and I’ve eventually come to the realization that I have a decent sum on money and profit from averaging down over time that I should actually get into bitcoin the right way. I never intended to get this far but it has made me some money and now I’d rather long term benefit, then swing trade it like stock
@_date: 2019-07-14 02:08:38
Same fucking difference.....
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:49:49
Lmao. Was at work listening to a 6 part video series on economics. Killed the battery. I usually let it run down before charging it up so I don’t have shit battery life. I’m almost always in front of a charger.
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:02:11
I’m with you. I’d rather we stay sub 10k for awhile. I’m trying to get at least 1 BTC lol. I’m late to the party
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:45:42
I apologize for be rash, thank you. I appreciate the input. What do you mean by setting my own “fees” I’m unfamiliar with this
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:09:36
Yes I’m American, why can you not trust coinbase? If I’m just buying to hold? As far as kraken, could I buy, remove, hold, and trade? That would be most ideal. I’d like to execute well timed trades and proliferate when possible. I watch BTC roughly all day and night minus sleeping hours. Even then I have timer to wake up and check prices about every 2.5 hours
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:19:00
Would like to acquire a bag first. Also I want to use it as it was intended.. a currency. I’m familiar with DCA. However it still takes an assload of time to get it from my bank to a coinbase account
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:59:04
Can anyone explain the benefits of this please? I’m new to this
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:23:51
Oh completely agree. However if you are doing $50 at a time... not really. For me it’s a 1% fee virtually weekly, that’s easy... one less six pack but I’m investing into a system and core values of currency that are underlying lacked as disregard by government banks. It’s absurd that a bank can loan out our money to another person at whatever fee they decide is “fair” and then leverage our money to make returns of more then the APR they offer us on a “savings” account. Savings account is another phrase made by the financial institutions to trick you into allowing them to loan at your money and give your returns on a fixed rate... it’s a huge scam on top of them diminishing our purchasing power and loaning our own money to us at a higher rate then we get on returns is fucking insane. Keep the common poor and the wealthy more wealthy.
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:12:22
I’ve been swing trading and DCAing BTC on Robinhood for awhile now and I’ve come to the point where I’d like to secure my profits in a more sound investment. This has lead me to actually want to keep BTC on a ledger. My question is where should I start? What do I truly need and where is my best bet for purchasing BTC and moving it to a hard-wallet? I’m using a MacBook Pro, so anything application would be preferred, but web based is okay too.
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:57:41
Can I DM you? Or publicly answer more questions? Lol are nodes connected to the network constantly? What would the average cost point to run a node? I’m assuming it’s literally updating nonstop transactions. Do you have your own node? This is all very interesting to me.
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:43:21
$9300 July 30th
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:58:00
It’s really like that though... you want it to go up, but you also want it to go down for more accumulation lol.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:21:12
How do you feel about gemeni? I heard their CS sucks ass
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:57:51
Yeah, I figured that. I wiped my ledger and recovered it with minimal BTC on it to learn that my seed words are my money.
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:26:36
Or I can examine historical data point. Evaluate trends... and take an educated guess. Lmao watch it happen
@_date: 2019-07-02 01:24:13
So you can withdrawal your $500 investment at break even money? Lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:26:40
*Sighs*. Time to buy more! ��
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:43:39
Literally what I’m trying to do. I knew I was never physically owning coin... then I accumulated a decent amount on robinhood, I’m not triggered into emotional selling, and figured why am I not just HODLing on a cold storage. The issue.. is I don’t really know where to start. I never intended to buy this much on robinhood and now I’m thinking I should just sell off my profits to start a actual wallet. The shit part is I’ll lose my low average but I’ll actually own coin. It’s a hand over fist decision for me.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:18:51
I’d like a coin like this for novelty fun.
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:09:09
I’m not concerned about mooning. I’d like to use it as a currency just like Fiat. I believe it has a strong hold of purchasing power the. The USD, my bank loans my money out and makes most of the return. They also dictate how much money I can spend per day regardless of wether I’d like to raise that limit or not based on my account. I’ve had them shut my card off multiple times based on what they believe is fraudulent if it’s not conventional to them... i get raped on ATM fees if I’d like to use cash for a private transaction. Banks are scandalous and I see this as a way to move away from traditional banking. If the USD tanks and bitcoin doesn’t.. then I have useless currency in the weight of the world. Anything can happen and I’d rather take my chances in a P2P system then take my chances with a bank.
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:03:28
BTC is a currency.. USD is currency. You can convert currency into other forms of currency for a small fee. Do you buy yen with USD? Lmao no.... that was a shit comparison. Milk and eggs are a good not currency.
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:19:26
I don’t click links I didn’t ask for. Especially from unknown sources. Even if you were like “try this link from coinbase!”
I’d still just go to google and search coinbase before using a html link.
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:00:44
It’s a currency... that I see value in and I make a good amount of spendable money. The dollar has lost purchasing power and most of my transactions can be dont via BTC I’m okay with this move.
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:12:38
As for a ledger I was considering buying this....
Any input on if this is a good product?
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:57:55
Oh that’s wild. I’ve been charging phone like this forever and never had draining issues.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:21:57
I put in $900 last month. Probably going to up the ante
@_date: 2019-07-14 02:31:37
Takes to long to get money into the account from my bank
@_date: 2019-07-14 02:30:22
Ooooo. Maybe so. Any rhyme or reason you believe it an extra $100 lower?
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:55:00
That makes sense. Is Electrum and application or? I literally downloaded Blockchain on my phone a long time ago and never touched it. I’m not sure what that does for me. I’d be making most of my moves via my MacBook if that helps.
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:17:04
It was a dm on reddit lol. I don’t know enough... but I know well enough not to give up my seed. We have a Dot peen at work and my boss was like yeah I can make a program for you what do you need? And I said 24 words that I can’t tell you and he’s like... yeah okay well I can’t help you lol... so I’m going to just etch them myself with a vibropeen into metal card and then disturb parts of the card in different safe locations.
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:14:36
Yeah, I use my phone a lot
@_date: 2019-07-14 02:31:11
Regardless... I need a faster way of acquiring crypto
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:29:31
I’m still pretty damn new to BTC and blockchain. I don’t even know what a node is but I’d like to investigate and even start diving into this. Any links or information provided would be super!
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:23:07
It was an example, do you not read? I literally said $10 is 1%
@_date: 2019-07-30 01:21:48
Sweet. I’ve only used Uber once with success so I wouldn’t know how to dispute this things but it would be nice to investigate.
Honestly I’m kinda dumb to the Bitcoin tech but I’m invested in it for the future. Is it for part.. financial gain? Totally. Is that the only reason I’ve hopped on board? No. I’d rather be here now and learning then late with no skin in the game and forced to learn. Any good material you can provide would be greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:04:51
Okay but I’d like to be able to set limits if I choose to instead of buying it at an marked up price on a market bid already, I don’t believe this is possible is it?
@_date: 2019-07-02 05:13:36
I’d like to see what happens.. we all know that it’s not going to surface again.
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:56:45
Does crypto not get the same taxation as stocks? You pay less in capital gains if you hold for a year? Or does this not apply
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:06:06
$10 per transaction? Hmm... I plan to hold and store value not trade.
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:10:46
Yes I’m American, why can you not trust coinbase? If I’m just buying to hold? As far as kraken, could I buy, remove, hold, and trade? That would be most ideal. I’d like to execute well timed trades and proliferate when possible. I watch BTC roughly all day and night minus sleeping hours. Even then I have timer to wake up and check prices about every 2.5 hours
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:45:12
Seriously though. I love the memes though. It’s a great indicator of when to buy and sell lmao
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:57:24
So I could just view my own transactions or anyone else’s for that matter? Even look at the genesis block?
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:30:20
Well... I literally don’t think lump summing it works well.. DCAing has a better rate of return over time...? $900 a month adds up lol
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:55:15
If we were to use Bitcoin as a daily currency... how could you dispute charges of say fraud?
Let’s say you buy something online from a  merchant and they never ship said item. Currently you would be screwed. As for banks... you can dispute.
I’m not defending a bank in this manor but it’s a legitimate possibility for encounters in current way of life.
@_date: 2019-07-14 03:05:45
I’ve never setup a wire transfer
@_date: 2019-07-30 02:35:24
Would be cool to develop a rating system for an address classified as a seller. Kinda like a paypal setup but verified by network confirmations. Obviously without PayPal fees and it should be a 50/50 swing in the buyer vs seller door. However.. I’m not computer wiz and idk how that would develop, how difficult it would be to implement and create... nor do I have any idea how this would ultimately affect business in a p2p setting. Obviously in person exchanges would be most ideal but with a decentralized currency... decentralized purchasing should also be embraced as so to spread the currency and create mass value.
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:34:39
Ledger nano X on the way. I’ll investigate the wire transfer
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:08:02
Yeah, but usually when the memes roll out you start to see over bought situations. However I agree, way less FOMO.
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:05:14

@_date: 2019-07-02 19:34:37
I’ve withdrawn money from Robinhood before.... I’m not taking about removing the BTC because I know I don’t actually own it. I’ve been trading and averaging down from the dips and profiting the spikes. I’d like to take the profits I’ve made from my initial deposit and use that money to buy bitcoin from a different exchange where I can HODL it on a Nano ledger....
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:02:10
Awesome, I really appreciate the help! Thank you so much.
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:24:13
No clue what that is to be completely honest. Someone suggested that on the dogecoin page... but it was midnight near the time of posting and I went to bed.
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:56:38
I refuse to use BTC as a currency until I have 1 full coin. It sucks because spending it helps it move along the way it needs to and I’d like to do my part. I just can’t justify spending it until I hit 1 coin for personal goals.
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:50:34
Uhh..... I have far more then 0.003 BTC
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:26:31
Lmao. I observe and hold. I’m not actually trading BTC I’m waiting for full adoption and just accumulating sats. Once I get my full coin I’ll start trading or buying like a currency
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:18:06
If you want to check it out.
I’m not quite ready to make a prediction yet lol. However we’ve been trending 300 a day average. 
My thoughts are 16k by end of month... likely August 29th if we break the 12400 mark and flag past $13800. However I don’t expect to see $13800 until August 19 - 20th atleast not a stable 13800 that is.
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:14:33
I wish I could get doge easily.... I just want to buy it directly via an exchange in US
@_date: 2019-08-09 03:51:29
I wanted to say this too, but I also didn’t want to rain on their parade. I’m on my way to my first BTC. Just stacking sats every week
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:01:22
Well I disagree but okay thanks for being unhelpful
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:37:16
Cars generally come with loans... BTC is an investment to me. I get where you are coming from. However you could take loss or gains on BTC. That car will depreciate over time and while one could argue BTC would do the same however BTC goes up and down. 96% of all cars end up going straight down. Maybe a bad comparison. Now if you were to say use LN and buy a soda and some candy with BTC and use the fiat to buy BTC... that’s a far greater comparison on why you should be spend BTC over fiat.
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:40:00
It’s kinda like saying... I’m saving $5k before spending any more money.
Just because I hit one BTC doesn’t mean I will stop buying it to use it
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:37:29
What is the price? I like Dogecoin. So I’ve trained myself. 1 BTC = 1 BTC
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:04:32
Average for the world is not a joke. I’m sorry but places with hyperinflation are looking at BTC. People who don’t have bank account are looking at BTC. The possibility of BTC becoming a world economy at face value is 50/50. It’s either yes or no. If you want to factor in variables and attack the face value then we can surely do that. I’ll side with it being a much lower percentage, however we are here to speculate and I’m going to take the lower odds for the greater upside. Even if BTC hits 1million USD... which... would mean we have a market cap of trillions. The world cap is roughly 80trillion based of CIA info in 2017. We can speculate a new number if need be.... but based on the info that would equate to 1/4th of the world market cap. Sooo...... at that point we could calculate things in BTC instead of USD. Think about that.
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:17:57
What would the odds be that they start burning their money and this actually gains value in a world market lmao
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:52:12
I bought the X and keep it with me 24/7. Idiots at work think it’s a vape or USB
@_date: 2019-08-16 23:38:34
Okay that’s stupid....  the point is to use BTC not sell it
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:43:54
A quick google search shows in US fiat that there are roughly 11m millionaires. So if BTC our classes fiat I’m USD then I’m in a much more scarce pool of “millionaires” in terms of BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:35:18
I would say this is just natural growth the market is testing 13k again. Anything going straight up is a pump and dump. The pattern is $200-300 a day. I’ll admit today is a little more rapid but we broke through that 11180 barrier and will retest 12 and 13k if we don’t get rejected.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:39:38
It’s definitely a give or take type situation. For every five small addresses there’s likely 10 large single address that out weight the small ones
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:41:37
Actually it was really useful because it tells me that there is a rough estimate of only 2,758,936 people have more BTC then me. However I would assume I’m much further up on that list.
Thank you
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:14:06
The price in 1hour will be 10967.28
This is just a joke. It’s to prove your purpose that no one knows. However if I’m right...... I predict the new price and it will be as good as bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:02:42
I literally fucking suck at saving fiat.
Ask me how much BTC I’ve saved???
Or don’t. I probably won’t tell you but it’s bigger then any account I have.
Fuck a bank. My credit union has blocked transactions so many times and left me dead in the water because the dictate my purchases. I can’t even buy a TV today if I wanted despite having the funds. I got vetoed for withdrawing money in Vegas on my birthday even though I called them and informed them I was leaving town and these are definitely my transactions.
You know what doesn’t tell me what I can and cannot do with my assets? 
@_date: 2019-08-17 22:02:49
Because it’s offline? It’s no different then any of my daily carry items? I can spend it literally at any given time. Why would I not?
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:34:31
Rumor has it, if you tipped me... I would hodl, but then again... I might just hodl. Who knows. Either way it’s a hodl from me.
@_date: 2019-08-17 23:24:17
Okay. And anyone with those things could force me to go to the ATM and withdrawal my account, yet that doesn’t happen? Lol. Plus I would just fucking waste my sats. Literally don’t care. Just like I would destroy my fiat. You face those same issues with any currency. Literally not any different. No one knows how much money or cyrpto I hold so for you to determine if I’m even worth robbing would be unlikely.
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:13:02
I called 9300 on July 30th. It dipped to 9350s.... I called that on like July 15th
I’ll find the post lol
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:12:33
Most ideally, yes... but I’d rather trade it right now. Let’s say I hold it like everyone else thinks to do and the coin plummet. I could trade out and wash my hands at a higher price. Until the coin stabilizes I see no value in holding. Especially at a high price. Roughly the coin equates to 3 trillion.... so with that being said... it’s not enough cover the worlds money which... seems to be the end goal. Which is somehow backed by the US dollar which makes no sense at all... but yeah, you get the point. Until the coin calms down. I feel safer trading day to day because I can’t pay for my house with bitcoin just yet. Or shop at the store.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:05:44
Seems fairly stable in the 10.7k range right now. Maybe 6k in a few days is a to high of a gain.
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:53:22
Also not gonna lie if you are into BTC and you are storing you BTC on an exchange you are not doing it right and I don’t consider you to own your BTC until it’s withdrawn.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:04:27
This is the total picture on a 3month chart... what makes you believe we are going down to 4K?
Personally I believe we are starting consolidation. Higher highs lower lows. We’ve yet to dip under 10k so far. This happened at 7-8k and while the point was slow... the market seems to refuse less then 10k. Uptrend can’t consistently go up forever. Crashing is inevitable. Even in a parabolic sense... we are unlikely to dip in 4K. The market dipped in 2017 for several reasons outside of overselling due to panic. I think we will be just fine. We aren’t even in a downtrend.
I’d say we just found a new floor for awhile.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:02:05
Nah, not like that lol
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:08:49
Most definitely. Let’s say that one person owns 5 addresses.... that only makes the pool that much lower in terms of accumulation and betters my case. Say we each had 0.1BTC but you had 5 addresses with 0.1BTC unknown to me, you would effectively hold 4 more positions in the 2.7m ahead of me meaning that I still place 2699995 out of 2.7m which would ultimately reduce the pool to 2699994 people who are intact not wealthy then me in terms of BTC. With that knowledge we could possibly assume more people like you have multiple addresses and effectively reduce that number even more only making me more wealthy.
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:18:44
It’s just speculation and noticing hourly trends. For the short term we’ve seen 300 a day. We tend to pull back from a high of 300 to about 180 and then overseas markets, (I’m in USA) will push back to the 300 market a day trend by 8pm PST.
If we go past the 300 move I noticed the next day will lag behind to follow the average. Such as today we are drawing back to that trend. This trend started on last Thursday. So you can pretty much predict based on trends. Most of our highs or lows in prices tend to fall in the 28th- 7th if respective months. Historically this tends to be a trend if we are bearish or bullish. Our worst case for any movement would be sideways such as 2018-2019 pre bullrun. 
Think of it like this.... this bullrun is like the massive long term run of 2015-2017 highs. We’re just evaluating that time frame historically will give you an eye view of things to come. History does tend to repeat itself with greater highs and lows. Fed cut rates which if you understand economics.. you’ll know they are stealing your purchasing power of the dollar. People look for more stable investments to avoid shellshock from the burst cycle. Based on my observation we will likely hit 11900 by midnight PST.
Looking for a breakout for Tomorrow over 12030 will confirm another rally.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:07:43
How’s about no.... also I’m pretty positive that Robinhood is here to stay. Regardless of how many people love or hate it. It has plenty of users and most of the money is protected. Think about it... fidelity and TD could shut down.... but the government wouldn’t allow that. How’s about instead of worrying about how I spend my money, a person you don’t even know... you can kindly fuck off and promote your bullshit to someone else. I could give a fuck about $25 in “FRE” bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:23:00
No shit.. I’m not actually holding any coin. I’m buying into the price point... hence the reason you can’t withdrawal anything on to a ledger. I’m very aware of this.
I don’t not personally wish to own any bitcoin, purely just invest in trading it. Thanks for the knowledge I already have. Still doesn’t make me ill-knowledgeable about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:01:29
You mean when new money lost its ass panic sold causing overselling, allowing whales to buy up at low price range and taking control of bitcoin... yeah that’s pretty depressing.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:40:31
Why because I’d rather invest in bitcoin instead of holding it in a ledger? Right I don’t understand bitcoin at all... lol
Let me toss some information your way. Bitcoin wasn’t even intended to be a decentralized currency until it taken over in 2011. At that time it was more often then not used on the silkroad to purchase drugs on the internet. DECENTRALIZED for people selling illicit product, then giving them the ability to exchange it to another person willing to pay a actual currency. After the silkroad was shut down three times a venture capitalist purchased seized bitcoin from the FBI with the the idea of a currency that could be profitable without the banks holding you physically money making interest off you, only giving you a fraction of the margin. Weird who would of thought.....
Fast forward to 2019 and we have places like coinbase doing exactly what bitcoin was created to combat, charging fees and interest to send money via peer to peer. So how’s about you shut the fuck up with your dumbass statement. 
At the end of they day we are all investing or buying a sting of code on the internet hoping that someone sees more value then we do got a profitable gain.
