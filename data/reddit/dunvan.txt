Decentralization can be interpolated by centralized power no more than True innovation can be regulated. My concern is that some form of regulation can be inserted into the the protocol.

yours is the kind of idea that might eventually make the price of bitcoin decrease during winter. remember that many here are greed driven. if you can acquire any BTC for electricity you would normally pay for anyway that is essentially "free energy". And what will the price of a bit be in 5 years? don't listen to these buttcoiners man. try it, develop it, sounds great and fun

i understand that is the business in which you are involved. idealistically inorganic is perhaps a better way to say it. it is a top down centralization of ideas. that's all - Im speaking to the sub of course. All promotion of Bitcoin is good with us but technologists in and entering the field should temper the evolution of their Bitcoin learning idealistically - adhering to the founding principle of decentralization - when we get out of the way( innovate outside of the transaction and fees) we stand a much better chance of successfully decentralizing everyone, right? just like how I would elect not to chat with marketers on reddit :)
