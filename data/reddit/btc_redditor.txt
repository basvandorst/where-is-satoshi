I sent around 1k EUR 20.03. there, it don't arrives yet .. IDK why, SEPA should take 1day.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:04:39
I migrated from Stamp myself ;) Kraken's security is superior to any other exchange and also they have BTC/EUR orderbook
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:59:42
also 1337 is there :)
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:57:43
Is this also available for amazon.co.uk customers?
@_date: 2014-01-19 07:45:15
I was recently waiting 3-4 weeks for 400e SEPA ... so no.
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:35:06
I had something similar (physical MC CC) from Dagensia last year, and I could spend BTCs everywhere and I did. But fees together was like 15%. I wonder what will be the fees here.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:32:14
full of shit

Isn't the Mastercoin that pemined scam, where you must burn your BTC in proof-of-burn process to get mastercoins and you have no chance of turning mastercoin back to BTC ?

Very cool reading
“And thus I clothe my naked villainy
With odd old ends stol'n out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.”

Its like :
* 1. Build a business around the idea that "Bitcoins can go only to the moon!"
* 2. Silk Road busted.
* 3. Panic! Sell everything!
What a joke :D

Count me in !
421 EUR -- SEPA -- initiated Dec 24 -- not received
RECEIVED ... after 3 weeks
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:14:52
It's ... weird ?
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:44:56
So what if someone from "spam experts" create 1000 accounts on fake names and emails ... and he(bot)'ll make like 10 000 $ for almost nothing. How are they filtering these spam requests?
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:04:38
I sent ~1K SEPA last Thursday and another ~1K yesterday ... still nothing in my Kraken account ... I opened ticket today and NO answer yet. I am disappointed.
EDIT : I just received funds from 20/03 and also got response from support, thanks :)

One winning bidder, seems like ~30M for someone is just a drop in the ocean, imagine that flood when ETF will be online.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:51:22
No, just normal withdrawal :)
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:40:29
hehe she's sweet :) It was fun to watch, subscribed :)
@_date: 2014-07-10 08:03:51
Thanks, bitcoin community is used to term "in two weeks™" :D
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:36:07
This is obvious bullshit, he threw away and stole investors money and now he's running away like irresponsible child. What a "CEO" ! :D
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:40:28
Yes first from Kraken, we'll see next time :)
@_date: 2014-01-26 09:18:49
this should be that "extremely good news on Saturday" ? i was hoping for something else ...
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:10:44
Yes, there is something else, Litecoin is useless.

Welcome in wild wild west ! Always use 2FA, never leave BTCs in online wallet, learn how o use cold storage and learn something about computer security, this was your lesson, if your BTCs are gone, they are gone, nobody is able to recover them back for you, in Bitcoin, you're your own bank.

I lol'd, they don't have any money, because western overlords are sucking out everything valuable from that continent for decades
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:59:14
Sorry,but they are telling this for months.Where are some results?
edit:Why downvotes?They throw away investors money for huge advertising campaign,conferences,and in the same time they're unable to open accounts for potential clients?Come on!Now they are multi-million dollar info-kiosk with hotline?Where is EasyCoin,where is big merchant,where is buy-in into bank?Where is some serious company site for managing accounts?Or clients will manage accs via blockchain.info?Lot of words,where are results?

"The Internet Party will support the introduction of a New Zealand-sponsored digital currency"  &lt;--- No way ! Another altcoin ??? What the ... why don't use Bitcoin instead?
@_date: 2014-05-26 08:28:31
So where are real-time audits (used BTC addresses) of other exchanges after this final Goxxing??? We should demand this proof of solvency. Blockchain is public ledger, lets use it.

That's my sort of people ) how can I join ? Let me know, I'm in bitcoin since 2012
