���� keep this convo and see who looks dumb in 2021.
@_date: 2019-09-17 19:54:34
I actually agree.  I kind of just wanted to try the hardware wallet to get the feel for it.  The ease and convenience of BRD far outweighs me possibly sending coins to the wrong address or some disgruntled ex employee stealing funds
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:24:33
But, for the people who only invest money they are willing to lose and who are willing to wait to be rewarded I’d say it’s def a much better bet to bet on btc over the hyper inflated, steadily declining, constantly materialized out of thin air US dollar.  That’s at least how I looked at it when I bought in.

How tho if my two factor authentication makes me authorize the login to the wallet on different devices?
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:56:37
It’s actually a very safe and secure wallet.  Not everyone has to have a trezor or Ledger.  Didn’t ask for a douchey ass arrogant remark.  Your life must suck that this is how you spend your time ya miserable fuck ����
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:00:27
Gotcha.  Well thanks for all the info. Def good to know.

�� god damn you’re just adorable.  Just trim that neck, get out of moms basement and maybe, just maybe you can get a girl to touch it.  Def wash it first bc I’m sure it’s been sitting under that massive triple fold food stained belly, but you might find a big girl to touch it.  I pray you do so maybe you won’t feel the need to be a keyboard tough guy

What company would I call being in extreme infancy with a $150B market cap?  One that will eventually be a multi trillion dollar market cap.  You went ramblin pretty hard so I def didn’t read all that but yeah that’s my general response.

@_date: 2019-09-26 14:08:29
Def good advice there!  You have a good week too, weekend can’t get here fast enough!
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:31:16
But in all seriousness no one knows what will happen.  I was thinking a bear market until a month or so before the halvening then shit starts to get real interesting
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:09:32
Ppl actually believe this?  With BTC in its extreme infancy?  Well, there’s no helping ppl with that mentality.  They are bound to fall victim to things like this.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:40:29
I’m with ya,  I bought at $18k.  HODL’d through it all.  This shit is boring at this point.  We shall be rewarded soon enough my friend ✊��
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:30:28
I don’t get why ppl still get freaked out by these dips.  I understand their are new investors in the space all the time and it’s most likely them but good lord it’s just ANOTHER small dip.  It’ll be fine.  As long as you aren’t trying to time the market (which will rek you) just buy on these blessings of opportunity and HODL.  Try not checking the price and Reddit 137 times a day and I promise you it gets much easier.  There are times I don’t look at the price for weeks at a time and it’s so liberating and freeing.  Give it a try.  3-5 years down the road is what I’m really excited about.  Enjoy the riiiiiiide!
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:21:14
My life is just great thanks!  Difference between us?  You day trade and make minuscule taxable gains while I invested money that means nothing to me and sit back and not worry about it.  Have fun with that heart attack and other stress related diseases from that awesome day trading �� also, how the fucj do you know when I bought my btc? I could very easily bought at $3000 and still an wayyyy up right now.  Just quit bumpin your gums while you’re ahead you sound like a clown
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:37:24
Yes.  Supply and demand.  It will far surpass $50k someday.  This is my opinion
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:22:26
I bought my coins on an exchange and sent them to my wallet.  I have the password and seed.  How do I not own my coins?  It’s not like I bought and stored on Robin Hood.
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:20:04
What points did you make?  I can see zero so far...... go ahead I’ll wait.....
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:36:07
Compared to company’s like Apple which is essentially who you’re trusting when you use BRD or  HODL on iOS, yes, they are tiny company’s
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:09:39
Hahaha man you are hilarious.  This is def the first drop for btc so you’re right, I should be extremely scared ������

Or are you saying all someone needs to do is remotely gain control to your phone and after that it has nothing to do with the Wallets?  But, even if someone gains access to your phone they still don’t have access to my keys or passwords plus even if they somehow did manage to login wouldn’t my second factor authorization immediately notify on any one of my other multiple apple devices?  Just seems extremely difficult fir someone to actually pull off.

@_date: 2019-09-26 16:34:42
Why would I feel the need to tell you how much bitcoin I have, when I bought it, how I store it?  Who the hell are you?  Some neck beard in your moms basement eating pizza rolls?  Grown ups are in the middle of a work day so I’ll be signing off here.  Have fun making your fortune day trading ��������
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:10:48
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:51:53
Fair enough.  But has that happened on HODL wallet?  Or BRD?  Not being a smart ass genuinely curious
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:38:04
Agree to disagree.  I’ll trust Apple doesn’t wanna lose its credentials over Ledger or Trezor.

I mean it’s a Supra.  Not my cup of tea but a very nice car.  What is it you drive?
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:38:08
I remember this douche.  Bet he panic sold and lost his ass too �� karma is real
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:10:36
I honestly wouldn’t know what the price even is bc I’m not a weak ass little bitch who checks every 6 seconds scared I’m gonna lose my ass �� adorable
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:32:14
Which is a huge risk in and of itself so..... plus like previously stated backspin virus’s can very possibly be set up with these small hardware wallet company’s.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:52:18
As is have ppl lost their coin on either wallets due to hacks?
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:22:24
You said you say trade and are just a baller while all of us who decide to HODL are dumb essentially even tho you have no frame of reference as to the price I/we paid or our long term goals.  So, again, you sound like a dumb ass.  Just stop while you still have a bit of decency.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:49:58
God I’d love that!
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:37:01
Yeah, that’s exactly what I said.  Nailed it.  Jesus
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:58:22
Our Lord and Savior I’d love that!
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:20:22
Lol you’re all high
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:48:20
I’d fuckin love it if his blind shit throwing against the wall sticks bc that means I get sub $4k BTC... unfortunately he’s just talking out the side of his neck as per usual.
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:31:08
You only lose money if you sell.  Quit panic selling and just chill.
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:43:38
I already use BRD as well as Coinomi.  I like them both I just am wanting some offline cold storage.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:44:47
You seem to be side stepping the question of not even these companies, but employees at these company’s possibly installing a backdoor software and knowing the seed and keys for your hardware wallet? Look I own a hardware wallet, I just personally prefer the HODL wallet, unless someone physically has my phone and keys they 100% cannot hack me.  What’s different from a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:36:41
Would be nice ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:18:53
I do this as well with my HODL wallet.  It’s the only reason I ever really know the price of btc bc I am always checking to make sure my wallet hasn’t been compromised.  But, from what I hear HODL wallet is pretty damn secure so hopefully that is true.  Wether you have an online wallet or a hardware wallet or a paper wallet or whatever there’s always going to be some level of risk.  Just live your life bro
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:33:05
Also losing your keys is a huge huge risk that’s been proven to be responsible for how many millions of btc lost already?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:35:39
Remember that Georgie... money isn’t real
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:30:39
It’s not gonna go to $4k.
