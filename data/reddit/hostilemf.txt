It's great that you mention 1995 specifically, because in this guy wrote a great article for Newsweek.
["Why the Web Won't be Nirvana" by Clifford Stolll](
Some great quotes from the article: 






This guy was no fool either, he is credited with doing some of the first digital forensic investigation. When he says in his article "I've been on the internet for 20 years..." in 1995 he wasn't kidding!
On the plus side, Clifford Stoll publicly admitted he was foolish in his thinking when [Boing Boing]( ran this story a few years back and he personally commented on it.

Plus one to everything you're saying about the header/footer and everything being printed on bank stationary, no matter how insignificant. And to add a further point of scrutiny: when's the last time you got a letter from a company that used Calibri (MS Word's default) throughout.
