If you look every day at btc/€/$, you're looking when to convert back in fiat. If you really believe in btc, imo you don't care and just want more satoshi regardless $ price.
Be happy with your btc and fck the €/$/£/¥.

Do your own research, good to ask questions but in the end it's you're own decision.
Alltough intensions from most people are good, you have to fact check everything before investing/trading.

Finaly a genuine post instead of pretending you want to make the world a better place with btc.
90% maybe even more is in for the money and want to get rich quick, or don't you?

There is only 1 faketoshi!!!
Fuck all fake faketoshi!

It's all speculating but btc seems to be the best bet, risk reward.
Gold and silver the most save bet.

You will pay learning money and I don't know if you can afford that or emotional handle it. Otherwise it can be very profitable.
@_date: 2019-08-20 13:29:49
I think I'm gonna downvote every faketoshi post,from now on. These clowns getting wat to much attention.
@_date: 2019-08-22 20:22:25
Maybe older people who invested don't brag on Reddit about a few sat they own.
Lets be honest, the get rich quick youngster pretending they know all the tech, financial markets, where the world is going to etc isn't the place for them.
I'm mid 40 and a lot of people of my age I know are in.
Nice thing about getting older is you don't stress that much about $ and are more patience.
The true hodlers that became rich slow. ;)

A lot of stupid presidents the last decades, in that context there is room for failure.

btc is borderless try to think bigger then bigmac country, asia is where I'm looking at as early adopters, you guys will be the followers. But keep living the American Dream, and good luck with the irs. :)

Trump isn't the president of the world, stop being so narrow minded nobody cares about Trump outside the US. He's the Craig of the presidents, a clown!
Bitcoin is here to save us from people like him and we fortunaly don't need the US to be on board.
