I love how to those people the fact that it "crashed" back to it's ATH from a month ago means it's dead and/or a scam. It's not like it's actually worthless... Still at $10k.

Something is wrong with your h key.

It was actually - He still turned a profit. I keep kicking myself for not buying more BTC a few years ago, but then I think, "no, I made the smart choice because I knew it was a risky investment."

When Trump was elected, I kept telling people that it's as the time to invest in Bitcoin. I said, "if I were smart I'd buy up a bunch of Bitcoin now, because when Trump fucks up the economy they're going to be our future."
I didn't take my own advice and it sucks. But that's probably because I wasn't a true believer then like I am now. I bought in at 10k. Now I'm just going to hodl.

It takes so long to process the time jumps though that you're better off using Timecoin.

Exactly! Glad to help.

Did it work?

Why would they want Bitcoin which only has value on Earth? They're already using Spacecoin.

Say I have 100 BTC and you think it's going to drop from 15k to 5k. You ask me if you can borrow 50 BTC and pay me back later.
Me, being a HODLer, am happy to because i trust you to pay me the 50 BTC back.
Now you sell the 50 BTC for 750k. If you were right and it drops to 5k, you buy the shares back for only 250k and give them back to me.
But this is where the risk comes: if you were WRONG and BTC goes to the moon, you now literally owe me 50 moons.
Trading on margin is where you borrow most of the money to trade and use any profits you make to pay back the debt instead of pocketing it.

First in first out is my understanding... So if you bought 1 BTC at $50 and then some time later 1 BTC at $5000, if you pull 1 BTC out today at $15000 it counts as a $14950 profit as far as the IRS is concerned. The other 1BTC isn't considered until you pull it out.

GDAX has the same 0.25% fee and uses the same account as Coinbase. If you aren't switching to Gemini or are waiting on approval, you can use GDAX if you're already coinbase verified.

If you have to ask ~~it's too late~~ just buy and hodl.

I'm pretty sure my tax return is going to be cancelled out by my cap gains from crypto :(

It doesn't even store your CC info, actually. When they run the card the first time, the merchant gets a transaction ID after authorization, which they can use to adjust the amount before it posts without actually needing the CC details. Other than that, pretty much exactly how you described it. :)

It is... with a bank account if hackers target you, you're likely to get your money back due to FDIC. With BTC, it's just gone.

Even longer - they've had it for a couple of years.

This is wrong. If this is happening to you, you need to find a new bank immediately because your bank is doing some sketchy-ass shit. No banks I know of charge fees for ACH deposits.

Okay, who's number one?
