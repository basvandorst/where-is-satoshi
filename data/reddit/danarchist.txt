Over $2,000, since he paid a premium for ten sequential $100 bills,  each with $100btc

It's actually the exact same blockchain until August of this year, when it split off. Anyone holding bitcoin from before then has an equal amount of BCH. 
BCH supporters argue that a 1mb block size was never intended to be permanent, and point to messages from Satoshi himself that discuss how to implement larger blocks. 
The fork was to preserve bitcoin as outlined in the whitepaper, and many people consider it to be the truest version of bitcoin.

I'm convinced that this, the most widely used pic of Ross, was shopped in a reddit thread about people who look funny without teeth, a la that famous Drake pic where he looks like ducky from land before time.
@_date: 2019-03-06 02:04:26
Don't worry, it's the ol' thing where "reddit doesn't know the difference between wealth and income"
If his income as ceo is a million a year then he's investing half of it in bitcoin, that's a good chunk.
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:45:24
Isn't that figure based on the notion that there are ~16million btc that people actually have access to? How many are people actually holding?

@_date: 2017-08-18 06:18:37
I don't think that's how that works. At 1mb we just have 8 times as many blocks. And either way, it's easy enough to download the whole block chain no matter how big it gets. A verified zip file of the first 8 years and then just downloading the last ~week would allow anyone to run a node no matter how shitty the internet connection.
Or really I have no idea, I feel like the more I read the less I know.
@_date: 2016-11-09 20:46:38
I dunno, I've just always used circle. They didn't need a lot of ID or anything IIRC and so setup was a breeze. 
And yeah, that guy had like 6000 replies, I doubt he had enough BTC for the first 600. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 20:28:09
Just download the circle app and link your cc or checking acct. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 20:30:48
supply chain pays workers in bitcoin, workers pay rent/mortgage in bitcoin, banks lend bitcoin for business loans... it's all very feasible. If Core gets its act together or gets out of the way I think we could see this over the next 10 years. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 20:36:30
that's less than 1% so still pretty safe. And consider that bitcoin inflation is at 3.5% annually for the next ~3 years, then it drops to 1.75, then .87 over the next 10 years. 
With $20,000,000,000,000 in debt USD inflation will not have such a nice go of it. 
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:21:21
Lol "as soon as it goes up ten times from the range it's in it'll "rocket" another 10%". Bold prediction there sport.
I think it'd be more likely to have a blow off top at 160k if it does make it to 100k in the next couple years, before settling back down to the mid 5 figures.

I like sats too. Especially round these prices, I saw a tipbot give 500 sats the other day and I was thinking "gee, half a penny" but it's 5 cents. So coffee costs around 30k sats.

Oh shit you're right. But really 10% in a day is a huge swing, and even 1% is getting more and more rare. 
I wouldn't hold 90% of my wealth in it if it didn't have massive upside.

@_date: 2015-08-19 05:01:18
260 vs 230 or 200 is more than a few dollars. I don't know what the ceiling is but if its less than 600 that's 5-10% and I would like to own more.
I'm mostly hedging against inflation and I don't think either btc or USD is going away in the next few years

I bought at 233 just 90 minutes ago. I had been thinking to myself for weeks that if it ever goes below 240 again I would buy. 
After remaining stable for almost 24 whole hours I thought I was safe. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:10:38
Sounds right to me. And then yes, it has flowed back into btc.
I'm not to hopeful for moon here. I think a few big players saw the ltc frenzy and bought in anticipation of the reward halving next summer. Good news for people who are late getting yo the platform.

So, do you just have no knowledge of how software works, or...?
It's totally possible to own source code. Someone had to write it. Just like it's possible to own the rights to a work of literature. Sure, no one owns the alphabet, but if I string 40,000 letters together in a novel way I can own that way. 
In more analogous terms: It's not like I own the number 5. It would be like counting to five in such a novel way that everyone will gladly pay you for a copy of a program that does it, and someone very rich could pay you for a look at the way you wrote the program, at which point you've most likely agreed that they are now the owners or at least co-owners of said code.

Just because I pirated photoshop doesn't mean I can recreate it and sell it with my own tweaks. That would take having the source code, which is owned by Adobe.

No dude, they own it. I get your angle on IP and government protection of their "right" of exclusive sale, but they keep the source code under lock and key. 
Just like KFC owns the secret recipe of herbs and spices. People may know which ones they are, they can buy some chicken,  reverse engineer it and get damn close, but they can't be sure it's exactly right without buying it from KFC.
