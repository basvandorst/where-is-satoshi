Uh, services already exist that transfer remittances within 24 hours from Dubai to Pakistan/Sri Lanka/Bangladesh/etc. with zero fees and minimal transaction cost. This is a much better rate than these ATMs, not to mention much easier for a population that largely does not have regular internet access and strong technical knowledge. [check it out](

Its an informal money transfer system primarily used in Islamic countries/populations, as its compliant with Islamic banking standards and relies on an honor culture. It does money transfer without money movement, also without any sort of formal or legal promissory instruments.
Basically you go to a reputable businessman or broker in your city, say Chicago. Tell them that you want to send 1000 USD to your family in Somalia. That guy calls a reputable buisnessman he knows in Somalia and tells him to give 1000 USD, in local currency, out of his pocket to that family. He does so. Down the line, the guy in Somalia will get paid back in some form or the other, not necessarily in cash.

Going through the hassle to get all my money back seems a lot better than "welp, lost my key/had it stolen. better luck next time!"
