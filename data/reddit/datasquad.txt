what made you decide to "own" bitcoin through Robinhood rather than actually owning the keys to your own btc?
@_date: 2019-07-31 03:57:52
You don't actually own the bitcoin if you can't transfer it to your own private wallet. Like a Trezor wallet for example.

"This Korean" was from Qatar just 4 days ago asking the same question on another post.

Why do you keep on spamming that you're trying to buy 3 btc. Just four days ago you posted the same question saying you were from Qatar.

Thanks for making bitcoin more scarce for us.

The difference is by using Robinhood you're treating it like a stock investment. Which isn't wrong but the very intended purpose of Bitcoin is decentralization no middleman. No one has control over your btc other than you. That is if you actually bought Bitcoin through an exchange ( Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, etc) and transferred it to your private wallet that no one other than you will be able to access. whether you use Bitcoin as an investment, a currency or a rare commodity like gold fyi only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist. If Robinhood doesn't let you withdraw your bitcoin.. than do you really own one of the 21 milion that will ever exist?

get yourself a ledger nano s. They only cost about $60 a small price to pay for total security. I don't know how much you have invested in total. but I'd transfer over the coinbase btc to a ledger nano and hold it until the next halving in 2020. While unfortunately waiting for the Robinhood holdings to go back up. I'd also would take this time until then to read books like The Bitcoin Standard and listen to Andreas Antonopoulos on YouTube. He's phenomenal at explaining the technology and potential of bitcoin to the average everyday man. Rather than obsessively monitoring the price ��
Wish you the best.

I want to start off this month with a positive note. Just yesterday I obtained my dream Bitcoin goal of joining the "10 Million Club" after frugally saving most of my shit job paychecks. I'm young nor do I possess responsibilities so why not live a little? ✌

I'm not one to advocate reckless behavior but hell I'm doing the complete opposite of him by putting 90% if not 100% of my income.

1 BTC = 21 Million 
2.1 BTC = 10 Million
21 BTC = 1 Million. It's just a fun way of looking at the scarcity of Bitcoin in terms of global population ownership.

This is what Bitcoin was intended for! Thanks for being an  early adopter ��

Hey man don't feel bad I bought 1 ETH at $700, bought two more at $ 88 and traded them all for BTC  recently so i can reach my bitcoin accumulation goal.

Ledger had a matte black friday sale. It was too good to beat for the price and satisfaction of knowing my coins are safe.

It's so exciting! Welcome to the club brother!

If you bought a considerable amount then the next step would be to buy a cold storage wallet such as Trezor or Ledger Nano S.

It has been nothing but my goal to accumulate over the next 2 or so years putting most/half of my checks into this, it pays off being young ;)
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:47:38
when I first got a job my first ever paycheck went into this, it doesn't matter if the public calls you an idiot now and a genius then or vice versa, all that matters is that you believed and took part as well :)

except this is reality and you're neither.

wouldn't dare to lose such amount! a cold wallet is the most secure way. paper wallets, Ledger Nano S, Trezor wallets
