That's all well and good but you did just offer a remedy, which means exchanges have the ability to reduce the impact of these attacks by a large factor.   Cloudflare is supposed to protect against this stuff, if they aren't doing their job they should be fired and replaced.

And if electrum as a company goes down in flames and doesn't maintain their software, I'll still be able to get my stuff out?
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:38:51
It's out? If not what's the Eta? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:21:07
Can I ask for your source when you claimed Segwit was developed by the best developers in crypto?  What did you use to measure that?

Your response is why this letter from OK Coin was written :/

At this rate I'm happy to watch all of my money go down the toilet.  If Bitcoin can really be hijacked by one group (which group intentionally left blank, as it doesn't matter), it needs to go away, as that's not what we signed up for.  We all signed up for the original white paper version of bitcoin, the one Satoshi wrote, the same guy who said the 1mb limit was a temporary spam control to be lifted later.

That means that Bitcoin was a joke from the start of that's all it takes.

Not sure if someone from Coinbase can chime in - I hope this means that all orders will be processed still and not cancelled.  Many of us made large purchases before the latest rally.

Literally what I had said 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:28:09
But you said it's a scam coin 
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:58:06
Literally has 0 to do with the point I made, appreciate the effort you put into your comment though
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:27:29
Keep thinking that way and more letters like this will come out 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:26:36
This is not good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:28:57
So people will buy Bitcoin with eth and withdraw eth. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:40:17
This is specifically how Bitcoin was created.  If one party can destroy Bitcoin, then it was never meant to succeed and I welcome it.

Thank you, I have been pushing for the Segwit and increase on top forever now.  Allies!

Not really.. most people don't understand that just because they are in the terms doesn't make it enforceable.
