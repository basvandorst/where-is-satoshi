This. Once the news starts talking about bitcoin again, all the idiots from last time will FOMO in again.

Yeah I'm not going to tell a weak hand not to sell. More cheap coins for me.

My guess is cause OP says he has 2 more years of college and math isn't that hard.

Just to confirm, Mycelium is a good place to store coins right?

Wait isn't point 2 what happened in the last US recession?

What the actual fuck is happening? I step away for like 10 min and it's soaring!

You shouldn't be investing money you're not willing to lose. That's like the first rule of investing, especially in something as volatile as bitcoin.

All you have to do is tell him "Obama didn't have the brains to support Bitcoin".
Bam! 5am tweet the next morning!
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:28:33
I too would like to know this
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:26:10
I don't have a tweeter. Fuck that noise.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:38:48
Looks like it's stabilizing. Thanks for the discounted bitcoins!

Does anyone know why it's been shooting up recently? Has anything specific been happening to cause this or is it just general increased interest and demand?
I've been telling my coworker about this and she asked why it's going up and I was just like "idk, but it is". Anyone have more info as to the cause of this recent increase?

srsly, remember when we were all pissing ourselves with joy over breaking 10k last week?

Don't let emotions ruin your finances. Know ahead of time what you can and cannot afford to lose and go from there.

What url should we use?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:53:49

Every time I see people try to qualify Millennials, I roll my eyes at their hilarious inaccuracy.
Not this time. *hits vape*

I'm waiting for the mini dip that's bound to happen before I go back in. Looks like it may be soon.
