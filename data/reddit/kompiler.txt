Boo! Please no. Everything this man touches turns to shit. Bitcoin doesn't need the endorsement of a proven con man. It would have the opposite effect that you are looking for.

I don't want to know. Also if he/she/they do indeed have 1 million BTC and Bitcoin becomes all that it promises to be, then they probably deserve it.

[bitNZ]( is a good place. It's not flashy which might make people reluctant to use it (I should know, I scoped the place out for almost a year before diving in) - it has a "number 8 wire" feel to it if you know what I mean. I've been trading there since June this year. The guy who runs it (and I'm assuming it's just one guy) isn't always super quick to respond to queries, but he does get back to you eventually.
I like the low fees too (0.5% trade commission) - I was quite shocked to hear how much sites in other countries' exchanges were charging. This fee probably stays this low because this market is quite small and self-contained within NZ (NZ dollars can only flow in and out from within NZ) so it doesn't get flooded with overseas buyers/sellers.
The only way you can deposit money there is over the counter at Westpac bank.

Great! A fellow Kiwi redditor/bitcoin trader... could I ask you what bitnz is like? Are they trustworthy? Have you ever experienced any problems?

Good luck! I've thought about going half-bitcoin. I'm not brave enough to even contemplate going full bitcoin.
If it all goes sour, at the very least you'll have an excuse to do an interesting AMA one day:
"Back in 2013 I went full bitcoin and now my meals come from dumpsters, AMA!"

At first glance I thought the cat was trying to avoid touching the floor by clinging to all four legs of the chair.
And I agree with the other comments, you need to get two of those things... floor kitty = sad kitty.

That's fair enough - but if you don't understand something, you should stop short of making claims about it:


A great news segment overall though.

Ah, yeah I'm having trouble contacting him also. It's been a week now and no response. So, is verification mandatory? I can see a button that allows you to do it, but it doesn't say anywhere from what I can tell that you actually had to verify yourself.

I agree. I think we do have to start using a more appropriate unit prefix. The psychological barrier people have to overcome when dealing with the current price of a full bitcoin is no doubt preventing them from adopting it.
Just over the last couple of days I've had explain to a few work colleagues that they don't need to buy whole bitcoins. That was the reason they gave me for why they'd been put off from even looking into bitcons.

I think it's definitely possible, but really difficult unless China buys back in.
Before the big sell-off on BTCChina, the market cap was over 14 Billion (and had a [BMIX score (rank) of 70]( - currently it has an 8.2 Billion "market cap". I realize the difference between then and now is not all attributed to China. Other countries followed suit in the brief panic sell-off which followed, but it's still a good indicator of the magnitude of China's investment.
I think it's going to take either a reinvestment by China, or mass adoption by other large countries like India and Brazil to get us there.
But who the heck knows where we will be a year from now. We all know how what an unpredictable beast Bitcoin has been over the last year.
I hope he's right.

Great. Yeah, I saw that only over the counter deposits are available, I'm fine with that for now. Thanks Slyer!

I don't want to discourage you or anything, but just take it easy with the extreme sports while you're in New Zealand... we kind of need you to stick around for a while longer.

P.S. A new NZ exchange has just popped up: [TUA]( ... it will be interesting to see how it goes. The devs have a thread going at [bitcointalk](
Edit: Fixed messed up url.

Hey Mine_Fuhrer, did you manage to get a hold of Daniel from bitnz?
@_date: 2013-06-22 23:45:25
I see. thanks for the info.

Well, time will tell. Let us revisit this story at the end of June 2014.
I have a feeling "Mark Williams" who "teaches finance at the Boston University School of Management" will have some elaborate explanation about some aspect of Bitcoin that he failed to take into account.
Of course, I could be wrong, in which case at the time I'll be buying a few hundred bitcoins at bargain basement prices!

Personally, I found this video a little bit annoying, but that's just me. I've also always through, just leave him/them alone, they don't want their identity revealed... However, at the very end he made a good point: If anyone deserves the Nobel Prize in Economics, it's Satoshi and very few people would ever say no to a Nobel Prize (except for the Peace one which let's face it, is a complete joke)
