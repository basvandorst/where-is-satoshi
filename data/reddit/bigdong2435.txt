Let me clarify. I mean on the street. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:26:56
I’m talking hookers on the street

I mean on the streets 
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:11:17
Will never happen. Can’t buy drugs and hookers with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:41:49
Yeah. Some chick with maybe a high school education that sucks dick for a living is going to figure this out. ...

You are obviously not familiar with the hookers on the streets. They are not going to use bitcoin nor are the drug dealers in the hood on the corners.

Op is a lonely pathetic hooked nosed troll.

Anyone else see the documentary?  I was all for him until he started ordering hits on people.  
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:41:53
Might have saved those charges in case he got off on the first set of chargers.

The issue was the fbi and us government spent god knows how much money on trying to catch this guy. He made them look like fools  for quite a while. They flexed their muscles and yes made an example out of him. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:36:40
The documentary which is one side of the story said it wasn’t the only one. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:15:39
Why is that a waste?
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:47:36
That will never happen. U need technology to own bitcoin and how many people in this world don’t even have fresh Water to drink?
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:01:03
Lol we don’t need countries? Sorry I want nothing to do with what’s going on in the Middle East and most of Africa. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 05:08:36
Explain please 
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:47:52
Think again if u think all the people that hold the gold will let this happen.
