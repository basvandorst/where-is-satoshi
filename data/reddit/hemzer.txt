That are not tracking you because you may be a crimminal or something. The point is you are not supposed to become Rrich and wealthy and thereby gain   time in your hands and start to learn and get in involved in the Democratic process of the country in a meaningful. That puts in danger the lives of the corporates and elites that control you. You are not supposed to be anything more than a 9-5 slave with just enough earnings for your daily bread and butter.

me thinks he quietly loaded up on BTC over the past few months...the sneaky bastard !! :-)
@_date: 2019-07-05 17:28:25
I am confused. Please experts clarify.As OP is looking for anonymity...After he moves it out of the exchange can he not simply just transfer the coins to a new public key address after.
How does anyone conclude that the new address still belongs to the OP? You simply cannot.
In fact the very first address he moved to out of the exchange has a possibility that it is not his but could be a charity's, his grand parents, who knows, right?
Coins can be tracked from its birth but the owner cannot once it is out of the KYC exchange, am I wrong here?

but he can be honest and tell us on National TV that what exactly you mention. Instead he tries to mislead people with phrases like "rat poison" , "baby brains" 
I mean WTF is he talking about. He sounds like an angry lunatic. 
Is this a serious investor talking or did he get a memo from the bankers to talk shit about Bitcoin.

Pardon my ignorance..but even if  he  did not run it trough the mixer, what is the difference?    
The receiver would not know if the main wallet (with the large balance) belongs to the same person, an exchange or a mixer would they.

How to extract the private key from wallet.dat? I do not want back up the wallet.dat but want to be able to recover from only the private key.
@_date: 2019-11-11 03:58:15
disagree with that. Banks were not needed to buy houses until they started giving out loans AKA putting you in debt. This in turn had all the fools run hilt deep into debt and jack up home prices. Bottom line house prices should no be so high. They are inflated due to our debt life style. So do we thank the banks for it? They made themselves relevant is this.

That is not possible because the actual Bitcoin blockchain is openly visible. You either have your Bitcoin or not. MC/Visa can't fool you on a ledger that is openly visible to the wirld

@_date: 2018-10-26 17:18:05
Currently India is run by an accidentally elected government. Most in the upper ranks are illiterate and afraid of any change that may not be understandable to them...leave alone Bitcoin. So in essence the Central bank runs the case as far as BTC is involved. And as you know banks and bitcoin do not go well together. There is no real concept of law ad order after this Government came in...but in future they will be last to the wealth run as usual and will be in late cursing all the way. It is the smart young people that will suffer in the end.

Back up your wallet.dat and your password used to encrypt it.
Install BTC core in another machine and use the backed up wallet.dat and password and verify if you see all you BTC.
and read this ( [ ) everyday while taking a shit. Lots of interesting materiel to grasp and you need the isolation and privacy to concentrate.

Bitcoin will never be used as cash. It is digital gold and will only be used as a last resort or collateral.
@_date: 2019-10-11 19:34:14
Logical reasons .. where are you living under a rock. Bitcoin is too fucking valuable to be used as cash to buy coffee you dumb fuck. It is simply too slow by design and that is a good thing.

FYI: They dint ban bitcoin . They cant, it is impossible?   
They just do not want people to use it a a form of currency bypassing the INR.   
That country was starting to prove its might ...but is now heading down the path of self destruction and is doomed to failure due to the current Government being an illiterate one.
