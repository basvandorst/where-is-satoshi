I dont really understand what you're saying. Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:24:16
You didn't make a point for your argument at all. 
Of course volatility matters. It's a measurement of risk which is an indicator of growth potential. 
If we compare a growth company to a mature company, and we are measuring where it will be in 4 years, obviously the growth company has more growth potential. Nobody thinks that Coca Cola will expand 400x in 4 years but a tech company can easily expand 400x. Likewise, no one thinks that Coca Cola will be bankrupt in 4 years, but a tech company can easily be bankrupt in 4 years.
So when comparing the USD to Bitcoin, if you don't look at volatility, that's like saying 'I'm just going to look at the return in 4 years, not factoring in the stability of one vs the instability of the other.' That's not a fair comparison. I'm not saying Bitcoin won't outperform on a per volatility basis, it probably will if it's around in 4 years. But at least, if we factor in a per volatility basis, we can capture the ''risk'' associated with it.
Bitcoin is a growing currency. Of course if it survives in 4 years it will be higher than the USD. the USD is a mature currency. If you want a comparable, you need something that is also a growing currency. You can't compare stocks to bonds without factoring in volatility because bonds are safer and always going to perform worse than stocks. On a per volatility basis, this is not necessarily true however. Likewise you can't compare Bitcoin a growing currency to USD a mature currency, unless you use a per volatility basis.

Tech is a small segment of the economy characterized by extreme growth and failure. Its completely unrelated. As an analogy if our economy grew at techs rate bitcoin would be terrible for business decisions. Imagine trying to make a decision on pricing a product knowing next year the growth of the economy can be anywhere from 20-100%. How do you price your product without completely screwing consumers? If the economy goes up 60% then you need to decrease your price by same amount to maintain relative purchasing power. In an economy where growth is 2% a year we set inflation =2% to erode the value of growth and prices can remain stable making business decisions way easier.

Tech is a terrible example of a growth rate that business people can become accustomed to. In fact many business people fail in tech for this reason and it is not reasonable to use tech growth rates to represent the overall economies growth rate. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that a tech growth rate is not a long term sustainable growth rate. Its barely sustainable in the short term!

You know these graphic cards are useful for aspiring machine learning scientists? Now these scientists gotta pay 2-3x normal rates because of a completely wasteful economy. Terribly inefficient allocation of resources by society. Imagine the increase in electricity costs in a city when the demand has tripled.

This is one of many reasons I dont think bitcoin deserves to be the cryptocurrency of the future. Its such a waste of electricity. There's more energy efficient coins out there but because bitcoin was the first everyone jumps on it. Also I think cryotocurrencies should be communist for miners. Anyone and everyone that mines should get equal coins. No one should get more than anyone else. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:39:44
But there's a sizeable enough portion that is. And history has not been kind to conspiracy theorists whether right or wrong. Even if bitcoin is a great idea and currency, if it is painted as a conspiracy theory thing then it is immediately dismissed by the broad public.
Think Obama and the birth certificate issue. That was a legitimate concern in my eyes and I'm sure in many of the publics eyes. Yet all his administration did, was call the people that believed he wasn't born here,  conspiracy theorists and that completely went away. It literally went from concern to joke over night. Donald Trump who was running for president bowed out the day after Obama dismissed it if I remember correctly. (Despite still no valid proof!!)
In any case if bitcoin has the conspiracists in its corner its not a good thing...
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:14:07
Just cause we can't find something exactly comparable doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Otherwise, we are just cherry picking what to compare it to. In that case I could say the USD is the best currency because I am comparing it to a rock. Let's not try looking for a better comparable, let's just use whatever I arbitrarily decide to compare it to.
Comparing Bitcoin to USD even though we are aware they are very different is fundamentally flawed. That's why I suggest at least measuring it as a function of the volatiltiy. I also suggest using SnP. Personally I would take a basket of growth stocks which I think are much more comparable to Bitcoin and then measure them that way. Alternatively, maybe a basket of emerging market stocks or maybe emerging market currencies. 
Regarding volatility as not a good measure of risk because LTCM blew up...According to wikipedia LTCM's trading strategies were a mix of market neutral and arbitrage trades. There isn't anything that suggests they blew up because of volatility. Rather they blew up because of arbitrage trades that did not converge. 
In other words, LTCM blowing up has nothing to do with volatility being a bad measure of risk. Point is, if your model uses volatility as an input and fails, that doesn't suggest volatility is the reason your model failed. Your model could have failed for a billion reasons. In LTCM's case it was because they took market neutral strategies that are based on correlations, but are not based on true arbitrage. For example wikipedia says they were long japanese &amp; european bonds and short US bonds. Yes there is an inverse correlation there, such that in normal times, this is market neutral. But this ''arbitrage'' strategy is very different from a true arbitrage strategy of buying XYZ in USA where it's only $4 and selling XYZ in Europe where it's $6. True arbitrage is based on the exact same product.
Conclusion LTCM blowing up has nothing to do with volatility.
PS LTCM was net short volatility and they lost 1.3 billion being net short volatility. They clearly didn't respect volatility enough to be neutral on volatility. Also, I didn't say bonds are riskless, but I did say they are safer. I think that's something we can agree on. Bonds are safer than companies, because by definition, bond holders get paid back first before stock holders in the case of bankruptcy.

Deflationary is a currency growing in value because the supply of it is growing at a rate slower than the growth of everything else being produced. Ergo if there is 2x more widgets next year than this year and the currency growth is flat, then my currency has doubled in purchasing power.
The difference is deflation encourages hoarding. In your example it is true your purchasing power increases due to your investment beating inflation. However the bank or company you lent the money to is spending that $$$. The bank is lending it out to another company who is using it to grow. In other words the company is trying to build more stuff.
Thus in the Keynesian scenario the economy is encouraged to grow while in the deflationary (bitcoin) scenario the economy is discouraging growth. One of Bitcoins biggest problem no one wants to address.

India has extremely tight currency controls. You can't get rupees anyway in the world until you are actually in India (unless you are buying it black market). You can't take rupees out of India unless you are Indian citizen: airport security are legally allowed to confiscate it as you are going through security at the airport. 
Based on that information Indian rupees are not even held electronically anywhere in the world except in a bank whose physically located in india. 
If India is that concerned about their currency leaving their country I would think the Indian government does not want Indians exchanging their rupees to bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-20 14:06:03
Your comparison has some problems.
One is that you are comparing one asset that has probably 30+% volatility in a year vs one asset that has maybe 5% volatility in a year. For example, if i put $1 in a penny stock and $1 in the bank, I might get lucky and the penny stock might be worth $50 in 4 years. But that masks the fact the penny stock probably had huge swings in between. It doesn't necessarily make the penny stock a better investment since the penny stock probably gave you a heart attack when it went from $1 to $0.01 and then back up to $3. Just like Bitcoin gave people here a heart attack when it went from $1200 to 600...
Therefore you are better off finding an asset that has volatility similar to bitcoin. I  think the SnP is somewhere around 20% volatility so that might be a better comparison. Alternatively you can take the return over 4 years and divide by the volatility to get a per volatility comparison... In this situation it may be that bitcoin outperforms on an absolute basis, but on a per volatility basis, it underperforms...
Beyond that, you are comparing Bitcoin to USD whereas what are you comparing the dollar to? Itself? That isn't fair because even if prices fall drastically such that $1 can somehow buy a burger in 4 years, the USD will still only be worth 1 USD. The bitcoin price may have risen as a result of the prices dropping and then it will look like bitcoin has risen relative to the USD. You need a 3rd asset to compare both of them to...

Why would you interject with a point that Media has a 'bitcoin is dead' view? How does that add to the conversation about proponents having a 'new financial order' view?
Knowing the media's view does not shed more light on the proponent's view. 
Therefore your comment is out of place. 
I'm guessing you really meant to discredit the author's thesis by suggesting the 'revolutionary bitcoin' view was not accurate and ergo his article was not accurate. I suspect that you aren't even aware you were doing that when you made your comment. Because beyond discrediting the author, there really is no other reason why you would add that comment, since it doesn't add to the conversation (either for or against the article's thesis).
However I could be wrong. Maybe you really do just interject with random unrelated comments. That's always possible as well.
For example, if I am discussing what type of couch I want in my living room, it would be random to start pointing out how comfortable the seat in your car is. Yes I understand they are related in the sense that they are both objects you sit on. However it is not a useful comment because you can't put a car seat where a couch should be. Either the comment is random, or you are making a case that the car seat should be in the living room. 
If you are making the case that the author's view is incorrect then I disagree with you. However if you are just randomly interjecting with comments that are not related to the current discussion then I can't really say anything else. 
In the thread made specifically for this article, I thought we were discussing this article, not something else. My bad.

This is the truest comment about why BTC gets hoarded.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:45:21
But you also have to factor in long term expectations and obviously people are aware that bitcoin becomes deflationary long term.
However, I don't think that's the biggest issue, I think the bigger issues is that one currency is mature vs one currency is new.
Based on that, either bitcoin succeeds or it fails. Does that really tell you anything though? If it succeeds, it doesn't really suggest that the US Dollar is a worse currency. It just means there was room for another currency in addition to the US Dollar. If it fails does it say the US Dollar is a better currency? No, since it could be another cryptocurrency that succeeds.
In other words, this comparison is faulty at best.

Why can't the algorithm distribute bitcoiners to all miners alike? Some system where miners must register and have unique IP addresses to mine. Do something to enforce an equitable sharing of miners. Then there's no incentive to create these huge farms that are a drain in resources. Next, change the difficulty of the algorithm so it is commensurate with the now decreased hashing power. Since everyone connected to the network can each get 1 bitcoin per X hours everyone does it to make money which coincidentally supports the system. No one can do additional. Less energy waste and more fair in terms of mining. Then you also dont have to worry about 51% problem.

Hey I appreciate your response. You made me realize that if I did lose my money in a bank robbery it would be insured, but that due to creating more money it would be devalued. Obviously that's better than nothing but it's a good point you make.
Regarding how to be 100% secure, you also made a good point that nothing is really secure so I have to ask you how to be the most secure in a realistic sense. I am new to bitcoin and all this is a concern to me because I want to be relatively safe. I'm obviously not going to get to the point where I have no access to the internet, but I do want to take 1 step protection above leaving my money at a thirdparty wallet.
So since you seem to know more than me, what would be the best way to be secure if I wanted to go one step above just keeping it on my bitcoin-qt client? I read that I can download a wallet locally, and then use truecrypt to protect it. Then I could send this wallet to multiple locations so that I would never lose it. Is that sufficient? 
Also, do I need to generate a new address everytime I send OR receive something, or only when I send?

So, despite everyone saying this article is dumb, I found it very insightful. Bitcoin is mentioned with so much cryptographic commentary that it does sound like it's secure to the layperson. I myself am a layperson who from this article realized that Bitcoin isn't secure at all. 
A lot of the bitcoin community talks about bitcoin being secure because of wallet this and sha256 encryption, but this article is completely valid in saying the comparative level of risk between this and a bank is significant. At a bank I never worry if my money will disappear because it is backed by the FDIC. With bitcoin, this article just made me realize my wallet etc may be unsafe.
Can someone please provide me the absolutely optimal way to secure my bitcoin money? Am I supposed to use a new bitcoin address everytime I send and everytime I receive money? (Or only when I send?). What do I need to do to completely secure my money? 
If I am going to get into this bitcoin game for the long haul, I want to know how to secure my money with 100% certainty...

Jesus christ guys where the fuck is this quote from? Where is the damn source?
Are we upvoting bullshit because it is pro bitcoin anti government now?
How the fuck can an outsider or noob trust anything from if this is the bullshit that gets upvoted? 
Fuck. This is the problem with Gold Bugs, Bitcoin Bugs, etc. It's the same propaganda bullshit by a bunch of fuckwits just on the opposite side of the fence. 
Downvote this bullshit and let's keep intelligent articles at the top. The moderators should fucking delete this post.
