Yeah holy shit that just jumped like crazy!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:44:41
Not a single person knows this answer. So, maybe? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:46:56
Make any $? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:53
Can confirm, $18k
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:07:50
Right but risking money that's not yours is incredibly foolish. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:28
Panic selling will help contribute to a drop like that. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:47:18
Sounds like the author has a hidden agenda by backers who want cryptos to fail. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:55:14
Considering 401ks are for longer term savings, it's really not that surprising that BTC out performed it. Shit, BTC is out performing almost every investment option there is!
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:47:05
Great idea, liquidate your retirement savings and toss it into a currency with the potential to be extremely volitile. What could go wrong?
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:37:18
I figured this would happen. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:51:04
I tried since 3 and no dice. Finally got to finalize my account though. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:44:29
Giving this a whirl. It keeps getting stuck with my secret questions 
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:41:35
Are you still honoring the promotion? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:05:04
That is fine with me. Keep dropping the price of gold and silver so I can keep on stacking
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:02:48
Let me guess, you failed to get in 6 months ago
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:43:42
What are you implying? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:00:41
Wait. What? 
I've studied Marx and Hegel for 5 years, the fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:35:52
If you can't hold it, you don't own it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:52:26
I would have to disagree, BTC is being driven up by day-traders and late adopters who saw the success of the currency and want to cash in. I don't think there is any market manipulation like other currencies and precious metals. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:41:45
This certainly does effect the legitimacy of the coin.
I remember browsing a Road of Silk back when BTC was valued at around $90. 
Venders had issues with pricing because of how BTC fluctuated without warning. 
Right now it's a sellers market and the day-traders on BTC-e are driving the price up, that and late adopters who want to get in on the BTC-rush and make a buck.
I think we will see BTC hit around $1900, plateau, then drop to around half that for a while.
Days when BTC traded for $30,$90, even $140 are over. There will be zero chance the coin drops that low because; it will be bought up by investors and the price will be pushed back up. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:04:46
Very interesting. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:02:44
Once and if they sell, it would radically deflate BTC to the point of instability. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:25:25
Thats what I meant in my original comment. Obviously their ideologies are not inherently communist, but the ruling party is/was communist depending on what state was in question. 
Both China and Russia experienced Marxist revolutions, so their founding base is largely attributed to Marxist ideology. 
Judging by your recent post history, you argue a Wiki definition fueled by copy-pasta. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:02:35
If we want bitcoin to be accepted by more venders we need it to stabilize.  Lets say you buy a $1200 smart tv with 1btc valued at $1200. The vender receives the payment, but that one coin has devalued down to $1100. 
If you are a day trader or investor, then stagnation is your biggest concern. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:35:01
Devalues 10%, grows 20% on monday.
Perhaps BTC will start to stabilize. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:44:02
If we want BTC to succeed, we need the price to stabilize. I'm not 100% on this, but I doubt its that easy for venders to price their product when the price of their chosen currency can fluctuate by denominations of 10 w/o a moments notice. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:46:09
Blame the hype train, the real boom came after the media out out the article about that dude who invested 26 dollars and made almost 900k off of btc. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:23:47
The future of the homeless is bright!
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:32:44
True, the jumps will only get higher once people realize that Litecoin is easier to buy into than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:34:28
Cool, signed up. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:17:37
China's economic policies have shifted towards a much more liberal structure. The USSR did the same thing shortly before their collapse. 
Politically, they are still very much Communist. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:19:01
Bitcoin can be valued at a fraction of a Somali dollar all the way to a few million.
But lets all keep level heads, what Hendry is saying is purely speculative. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:18:19
Try this out 
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:24:13
I'm sorry, you wrote an essay about bitcoin when the requirements were something so fucking mundane as "cleaning your room"? I looked over your work, it rivals the clarity of some students at my University. 
Hate to say, but you are probably one a higher intellectual level than your classmates and perhaps this "teacher" and that class are inhibiting on your learning experience. 
TL;DR, that is bullshit
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:30:02
Gold and silver have been on a decrease well before the bitcoin boom. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:05:15
It really depends.
I think an easy comparison between the two would be gold and silver. 
Gold being bitcoin, Silver being Litecoin. 
Both trading at 1BTC or 1LTC (sic), compared to 1 oz of the metals.
Gold will always trade higher than Silver, same with this. I think Litecoin will rise in value, but the jumps will not be as significant as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:30:22
Yes, but the currency can't grow if it proves to be unstable. The problem I have is the day traders and late adopters who are investing in BTC purely for the profit. They are the once who are driving the price up, the issue with that is the BTC could seriously devalue once it peaks. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:39:19
The dollar lost its intrinsic value with the disenfranchisement of the gold standard. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:29:17
Gold hit $1900 per oz about a year ago, has dropped to around $1250
Silver hit $49 about a year ago, has dropped to under $20..
Sure, the gains are not as significant as the crypto-currencies, but it is unarguably more fun to hold. 
With BTC on the verge of hitting gold prices, I think we can expect more hype and possibly the dropped of gold prices to under a grand. That would be great. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:45:50
That sounds like a bizarre experience. What you just described sounds like a meth deal.
What is there to be nervous about?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:21:59
I wish there was an easy way to move my funds from paypal towards crypto..
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:57:37
What a broad range of multipliers! At this point, it is anyones guess what BTC is worth. 
I hate these speculative articles. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:50:09
Awesome! Thanks :D
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:53:18
So, theoretically China buys 40% of all BTC at current value, what would that do to the price to the remainder?
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:15:30
" estimate the current cost of a similar event to the world economy at $2.6 trillion (£1.67tr)." -Wikipedia
Damn, that is some scary stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:28:51
Hoarding will drive the price up, then the dumping that will follow will drive the price down. 
bitcoin is absolutely fascinating to follow. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:28:39
A very profitable bubble. With the current hype, we won't see it stabilize for a few weeks and it will most likely settle high.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:54:45
Boy was this guy right.
