It's a Trading Bot, not a magic show. That would be lovely, but my goal is not to make unreasonable gains, but to beat the growth of bitcoin in the long run. So far, I have been able to do that. Not exactly 2 or 3 % in 24 hours. But 33% in 19 Days if you pulled profits right now and put your money in the day that I started collecting data.

So I started collecting data on November 2nd. (Price Data From GDAX) Granular at 1 Minute. I have about 30,000 Data points. I have it running purchase orders every 4 hours. My best backtesting strategy shows about 33% Gain since then. About 13% above bitcoin's change since then.

ML computing power doesn't really get expensive until you are in the multi-millions of data points. EC2 has proven to take care of my computing needs for a decent price. You are right though. As the dataset get's larger. I will have to increase my computing power.
