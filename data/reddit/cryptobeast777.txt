Bitcoin will never go below 3100 again

Good point!
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:19:06
Why? What if every country banned it?
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:32:10
Not really that safe. If it goes to 101k you lose....

I wish we could meet friend. My testimony has converted some.

Speaking of weed. I’m smoking a joint while in the hot tub right now. I can’t move
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:22:51
You sound like every square I’ve spoke to
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:40:55
And if you stopped the internet/electricity the world would end anyways
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:51:20
Bitcoin will stabilize when one satoshi is one cent.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:30:13
So you’re shorting the market? Cool man! Nobody cares!

What if he dumps on the entire world?
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:20:55
Just started moving again. Makes sense man!

First of all, you are bias if you automatically assume I am a male. That already tells me a lot. Second, not everyone is gonna go to college because of the prices.
Third, how are you judging me off a transfer of wealth statistic that I happened to throw on the table.
You have a typical gloom outlook on life. 
I’m 24 and graduated college with no debt thanks to athletic scholarships. There are always ways to beat the system. You just need to find them.
Hint: bitcoin is one of them.

It’s a tactic to wake people up who own 0btc. Maybe he wants to help people get richer? Maybe he wants to get richer? Doesn’t matter. Why do you have to try and call him out. Who cares!!! Lol

I love Jamie Dimon!
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:21:22
You have some issues brother. God bless.
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:21:32
I agree��
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:05:40
Ur wrong. Billionaires are buying up bitcoin right now for a reason.
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:59:16
What billionaire would say bitcoin is better then currency when bitcoin is a threat to their fortune in the long run. Think about it........
@_date: 2019-05-08 23:30:05
Crypto will go up in a crash. Get your facts straight.
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:03:48
I ordered a bitfi2. New technology, you get to make your own personal private key.
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:08:03
He’s covering his ass from the authorities. He obviously does not want anyone to know he is Satoshi.
Also explains why the wallet will never be touched, because Bill is already close to the richest MF on this earth.
@_date: 2019-05-07 18:15:17
Get a bitfi
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:15:08
Historically speaking? 
There hasn’t been a big crash since bitcoin has been around. Not sure why you are talking about. Please explain.
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:33:41
I agree.
If you had to guess, what would you say the actual number is?
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:47:52
Buy a bitfi dma2 
Problem solved
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:54:46
What are your reasons for him not being satoshi?
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:51:36
Why are you so dumb?
