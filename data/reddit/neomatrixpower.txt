Absolutely Right, people don't see how Bitcoin futures is controlling the price of BTC, hopefully they don't short BTC again next month.

Bitcoin was growing because it was outside of the banking system which means no control. But that all changed on Dec 18 when the Banks locked bitcoin with Futures, these are the same people that manipulated the price of gold and silver, what do you think they are going to do to bitcoin?
Rather than billions of financial dollars pouring into Bitcoin to buy and HODL it, the banks will now use the opportunity to pour a lot of capital into futures to short it.
Now the uncontrollable become controllable.

Very interesting, and let's say if the price of BTC is $200 , what will happen to all the alt coins? Do you think one like ETH will replace BTC or BTC will bring down all the Alts with it????

Yes TA is good sometimes but when it comes to crypto, news,FUD/FOMO is what brings a coin down or up.

They've been saying this for a long time, and they will say bubble again when bitcoin gets to 30k, 50k, 100k.... but the truth is that the bubble is not for bitcoin but for all fiat currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:25:10
