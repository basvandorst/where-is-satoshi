Ok, I will focus on the drops then. Just like I did on Friday!

What is better: Buy a piece of BTC monthly or weekly (same amount in both cases)?

wait, what does that mean? I have a Raspberry Pi gathering dust because I don't know what else could I do with it at the moment. If I can do something crypto-related with it, then I'm all in!

So which wallet can I use? Could you please recommend me one or two? I'm from Argentina, if that is relevant.
If I transfer my BTC to a wallet, I may have to pay transaction fees. Is it worth paying anyways?

It depends. I don't know how it would be done in the US. Maybe report the maximum amount of BTC converted in US dollars in the FBAR/ FinCEN Form 114. Regarding income tax, maybe it should be reported as selling gold, but it may have a different treatment so don't take my words as a verified advice.
I live in Argentina, where it will eventually apply for wealth tax. It is possible that I will have to pay taxes if I cash them out.

Hello everyone, newbie here. I'm from Argentina and bought 0.027 BTC past friday from Ripio.com (bitcoin exchange).
Problem is, I heard there's a fork incoming tomorrow and that will create the B2X. I don't know how to deal with this situation, so these are my questions:
1) Should I move my BTC to a wallet like blockchain.info or should I focus on getting a Ledger Nano asap?
2) I'm willing to pay the outrageous transaction fees for B2X, but is that really worth it for getting an altcoin?

Nice giveaway! Those wallet cards look pretty cool :D

If someone shares their Bitcoin address in a website, it could be considered a risk or not?
