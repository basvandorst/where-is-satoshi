There is only one movement that is relevant in this space in the long term.
And that is the number of wallets and users that are entering the space. That is showing a exponential growth rate from the beginning, now entering the steep upward slope. As long as that is not slowing down, everything else is noise.....

It is not a bull market. It is the s-shaped adoption curve that is evolving.

Indeed hardly, which is weird because there are more  euro’s in circulation than dollars. But then again most markets are (still!) nominated in dollars.
Would it be nice that markets started to be nominated in bits?

A fork is only needed when a software change is not being implemented by consensus and the users do not accept the proposed change.
Like Dodgecoin and Bcash was: a small centralized group tried to enforce changes to bitcoin. This was not done by consensus and this not accepted by users. So they needed to fork an altcoin.

It’s not a ponzi or a quick rich scheme.
I buy stuff with bitcoin, and replace the bitcoin afterwards by selling fiat currency.
If you are looking for advice: do not try to trade, you cannot win from a buy and hold strategy unless you are a full time professional day trader.
DCA is a proven and safe method that shields you from big drops right after you bought.

Buy and hold.
Dollar cost averaging.
Buy only and with all the fiat you can miss.

Fasten your seatbelts! This rocket has just left the platform!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:11
I would say a dip is back to 4000-5000 dollar.
That’s a normal bitcoin correction of around 70%
But the amount of new user influx will first determine the height of this bull run.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:47:18
You are giving mixed signals here.
Ok, so you assume that dollar cost averaging will cost you money, because there will be no downturns ever, so better go all in now, so you will not have to buy later a higher price.
That could be the case, although Bitcoin usually has 30-40% downturns every now and then.
But at the same time you have now sold 2/3 of your bitcoin, because you expect a lower price!
So what do you expect? 
Lower prices (why you sold) 
or higher prices (why you say DCA doesn’t work)?
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:12:35

Indeed! The weird thing is that in a debt based monetary system, there is never enough money to pay back the initial loans AND the interest! So the usual short term solution is creating more debt to be able to pay the interest. In the beginning that is hardly noticeable, but as we are now experiencing with bitcoin, 1% per day starts slowly, but suddenly it erupts to something really big!
We have been here before in history. The only way out is:
-hyperinflation ending in war.
-debt relief: rendering all debts to be cancelled.
Both “solutions” always end in the nullification of the old currency and the issuance of a new one.
The rich people always survive these transitions by allocating into hard assets like gold, real estate, art and stocks of crisis resistance companies like oil and food. 
Now we have a new hard asset to survive the crisis: Crypto currencies and especially Bitcoin!!!

Then you won’t need to cash out: just buy the house with a bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:07:25
Yes, dollar cost averaging and buy and Hodl!
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:22:08
Not for some reason, but for a very specific reason!
To make it look bad. So people will not go into bitcoin. The establishment is afraid of bitcoin because they cannot control it and they cannot print it like they do in the trillions of dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:44:19
Try pasting your exact question in google.
The first hit is your answer!!

I was just kidding �� I do both at the same time!! ��
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:33:02
Indeed! The only strategy that works in the long run is:
-buy and Hodl 
-dollar cost averaging 
-buy what you can miss every month.
-only sell if you need the money for something and not a bit more.
Then relax and watch this unfolding right before our eyes and remain in awe and thankfulness!!

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:11:18
Just buy and hold. Buy regularly in order to dollar cost average. Do not sell, even if you are scared to death in a big dip. Don’t chase a price melt up either.
FUD is fear uncertainty &amp; doubt.
FOMO is the fear of missing out.

@_date: 2018-09-04 05:06:35
There is no logic in this. There are a very large number of transactions on the bitcoin network daily. And this number is growing over time. The miners collect the transactions in a block.and the full nodes check if the blocks are valid and store the blocks in the blockchain. So if you run a full node, you support the bitcoin network!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:44:12

@_date: 2017-12-04 03:40:29
0,5 - 1% per day is the average growth rate. This Will flatten out a bit over time. But it fits the 7 years growth rate just fine!

What mobile wallets support lighting?
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:45:02
Litecoin is based on Bitcoin code and is improved in speed, fees and TPS. DigiByte is based on Litecoin code and is dramatically further improved in security (digishield, real time difficulty adjustment), speed (within one second from wallet to wallet, 15 second blocktime), ultra low fees and a huge on chain transactions support. DigiByte is already now suitable for an enormous growth. Bitcoin is ahead in time in terms of adoption and network growth. Litecoin is behind that and DigiByte even further in time concerning network growth. The three are complementary, are all three Segwit enabled (DigiByte was actually the first) and support Atomic Swaps.
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:43:44

@_date: 2018-08-11 04:19:46
Hmmm that is what they want you to think. The real definition of inflation is money printing. The rising prices are a consequence of that (more money chasing the same goods). 
@_date: 2018-08-09 09:21:01
You are mistaken with fiat currency like dollars, they have a core value of zero. And they are printed by the trillions to dilute the last buying power you have to zero.

I wouldn’t know as i don’t about this deep web you are talking about. I only know you have to be very dumb to use bitcoin for illicit transactions, as it is an OPEN ledger, it is also tracked. 
I only know about the facts and they are: less then 1% of the Bitcoin transactions are of illicit use: 
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:21:42
Wow... stupid goes....so this drugs FUD still works? Even when nobody uses Bitcoin to buy drugs? ... tsssss..
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:56:36
Luckily also: 
@_date: 2018-08-05 08:55:01
Yes of course bitcoin is safer now because of the enormous hashrate and difficulty. But that doesn’t mean DigiByte isn’t safe, it is safe and 100% on chain. DigiShield is a combination of real time difficulty adjustment and 5 alternative mining algorithms, across GPU and ASICS. In this way, you cannot easily overtake the network, or take it hostage by dropping hashrate. Bitcoin has this problem now, Chinese miners could shut down bitcoin effectively for months! 
Main takeaway will be that in the long term the big three will survive: Bitcoin, Litecoin and DigiByte. Because they are independent decentralized networks, poised to act as global currencies more and more each day they grow.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:34:02
Would be nice indeed! But better to start DCA from here
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:30:50
Just ignore the fud, buy more , take advantage of the dips
@_date: 2018-08-17 12:25:14
The number of illegal transactions on Btc are so low , it’s not relevant anymore. Even the most stupid people know bitcoin is not private. Do you want to know what is used most for buying drugs? Yes, it is the US dollar. So what? It is not the currency that is relevant here, it is human behavior. So stop bringing on this non-issue, it is not relevant. Only used for FUD 
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:41:32

@_date: 2018-08-10 13:22:18
A global currency and store of wealth, incorruptible, globally accepted and recognized is very valued in a world of debt based fiat currencies that are printed by the trillions only to dilute your buying power in a downwards rat race....
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:31:32

Those people are the ones selling now... when that is done, the next run will happen!
@_date: 2018-08-10 19:18:30
Inflation by definition is the increase of money supply. The rise of price is a consequence of that. Because fiat money is debt based, eventually it will lead to an ever increasing cycle of more inflation and price rising.

Huh? Why do you react so off topic? I don’t know about the deepweb and I don’t care.

That’s interesting indeed. I follow NEM for quite some time now. And I see a lot of expansion, the spread started from the Far East, going to Australia and New Zealand, now also southern America and recently also the US. A lot of new companies and projects are building on NEM. Also new ICO’s are being deployed on NEM. Maybe indeed the overload or geography was hampering in your case?

Amounts attributed to a specific address are validated and checked and determined in the blocks mined and stored in the distributed ledger, stored on the nodes.The smallest value of breakdown is one Satoshi: one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. Price is determined by this smallest denomination and by one whole Bitcoin.

1) Send all of your bitcoin to another address you control.
2) install coinomi wallet app
3) import the private key of you original bitcoin address in the coinomi wallet, starting with the highest value bitcoin fork and work your way down to the lowest.
Be aware that this only works for private keys of an address that contained bitcoin at the moment of the hardfork. If you have more then 1 bitcoin address, you have to do this for all addresses.

What kind of answer is that? Totally off topic. You are trying to put me in a spot or try to get an emotional response. That are not so nice tactics. Why would you do that? What is your motive? 
If you really want to know how inflation is caused by money printing, read this:
“So from a macroeconomic point of view the only cause of long term inflation is an increase in the money supply, since the other causes are self-limiting and of limited duration.”

These are no arguments, and flawed logic...
Yes, there are clearly revolutionary things about DigiByte. It has 15 second block time with 5 different alternating mining algorithms. That means that wallet to wallet transactions clear in 1 second and are checked by the network within 15 seconds. That is the fastest of the real decentralized UXTO blockchains out there.
It has DigiShield which protects against 51% attacks. And it scales very good over time, in step with the growing amount of transactions. The scaling and huge number of transactions are proven and tested on the real blockchain. 
Next to that, the very innovative Digi-ID is part of the new mobile Android and IOS DigiByte Wallets. With Digi-ID you can seamlessly login to any website or other service, without username password, but with a crypto graphical signed transaction.

The big problem with debt is that there is never enough money available for paying back the debt , including interest. The only option is to create more debt, so that the interest can be paid. But that makes the problem even bigger. This leads to an exponential growth in debt, which historically leads to defaults and reset and yet another new version of a fiat currency... usually accompanied with wars.
Ps; also just think about who receives the interest? Why do they receive this? It’s a free reward, no work to be done, just print more money!

No, there is per definition not enough money available in the system to pay back the interest. If you combine the sums of all debts and add up the compounded interest of all these debts together, that is way more than all the available money in the system. So the only way the system can stay afloat is by creating more debt. Hence leading to an exponential growth in debt, with the historical consequences of default, reset and war.
Ps: if you calculate the compound interest on a 30 year 5% mortgage, you will be amazed how much that is! You will pay your house twice to the bank. Why does the bank gets this free money?

Between 50.000 and 100.000 dollar is a realistic target for 2019.
If bitcoin keeps on developing like it has the last 7 years, then 500.000 in 2021 is possible.
Higher values are also possible, but then probably in a high inflation environment, so it will mean less then.
This is based on the availability of money in other assets. Like gold for instance: the total value of gold only is more than 7 trillion dollar. So that is 7000 billion, so that is 50 times more than Bitcoin at the moment. If you look at money supply, stock markets, derivatives etc, if even a small portion (5%) will flow into bitcoin, it will reach easily 500K per coin.

Bullshit. The Bitcoin network is sometimes being spammed by miners. Usually right before a Bcash pump, a scheme to get bitcoins from easy preys.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:37:11
Bcash is a clone of Bitcoin with lesser code and smaller and less secure network. Lite coin is also a bitcoin clone. Why would they survive if bitcoin failed?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:10:52
Look here;
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:26:16
There are no fee issues with bitcoin. $0.23 fee is going quickly through.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:38:19
I don’t know what you guys are doing wrong! I never, I repeat, never had any problem at all with any Bitcoin transactions at all!
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:11:53
Yes, segwitx2 failed, but the info is still valid if there is a different hostile fork in the future.
There is a difference between:
-an SPV wallet: is a light wallet, which needs to connect to a full node.
-a full node, that validated transactions itself.
-an app/account on an exchange like coinbase or blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:32:07
It are the wallets of users and the exchanges that are being used to send Bitcoin front and back that will need a software development change and implementation to cater for SegWit support.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:20:57
Indeed, just watch all the money that has flowed into bcash, flowing out to Bitcoin one day. It could take some time, but in the end all altcoin rivers lead to the  Bitcoin sea....

Bcash is just a clone of an old version of Bitcoin. And Bcash is centralized. They use it now to get your Bitcoins from you. And they even do not have to pay you for it! They just give Bcash back! Same trick as with Ripple. It is really hard not to lose your Bitcoins these days....
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:08:22
Crypto currencies and Bitcoin especially (because of the large network and adoption) are a new and different kind of monetary instruments.
They are different from fiat currencies in 2 important ways;
-trust less; you do not need a third party to store or transact. So there is also no third party to intervene.
-fixed amount: the end-amount and inflation rate is fixed. So unlike fiat: it holds value or even grows.
The current debt and monetary crisis we are running into causes by endless fiat money printing and government debt explosions are driving us to an alternative.
Gold used to have this functionality, but Bitcoin is way easier and faster and cheaper!
That’s why!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:31:18

@_date: 2017-11-19 02:43:22
My fee was $0,15 today! No problem!! I never ever had any problems what so ever with fees. Low fees always get through, usually within a hour or 2, but sometimes it takes a day when the mem pool is spammed by miners.
I really do not understand why everyone keeps on complaining about the fees!! Maybe they have a wallet that uses to high fees? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:17:41
Ok, then I’m curious how Bitcoin can fail, but a cloned altcoin with less security and users and a smaller network will not fail.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:19:47
Great! Now lets see how high you can get! 1 btc is getting out of reach these days, so maybe 0,1 btc! 
If we use Satoshi, that would mean:
10.000.000 Satoshi, go for it!!!
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:23:09

All sell your Bcash for Digibyte. Very much faster than Bcash with lower fees!!

@_date: 2017-11-04 21:46:20
Well, the truth is the other way around. Jaxx has stated that they only support segwitx2. So they will try to change your bitcoins into segwitx2 coins.
Be aware! Unless they change their position.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:00:37
I did it for $0,15 they always go through. This fee shit discussions are pure bullshit!!

@_date: 2017-11-28 20:25:06
Guesstimate is around 50 million now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:16:19
Segwitx2 does not solve any long term scaling issues. And it drives up costs to run a node and pushes out nodes that have slow internet connection , so it will lead to centralization. But even worse, it is an attempt to take over the Bitcoin code, centralize it without consensus. And with too little dev capacity. That are the facts.....So if you like bitcoins, you will dislike segwitx2. 
This has nothing to do with loud crazies as you call them,.... 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:12:04
Well, the repetitive sharing of the list and the vigor of his communication looks a bit off indeed. Or it it simply a sign of hyper focus!
But the fact is that people don’t accept it any more that shady actions by some individuals are shielded by nameless companies or governments. There is always an individual behind an action and those individuals must be able to be held accountable for what they do.
In this case, it is not “bitmain” or “BitGo” or what have you who are responsible, but individuals like Roger Ver and Jihan. We do not accept companies any more as legal entities and do not accept it anymore that the individuals that do the bad things can get away with it under a company or government shield.

Thing is, Bitcoin has nothing to do with equity.
There is no bitcoin headquarters or ceo ��
There is no bitcoin balance sheet, operational cash flow, nor capex or opex spend or revenues or profits!
Bitcoin is a new financial network that is gaining adoption.
The level of adoption is determining price, nothing else.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:03:21
I’m not saying it cannot correct or that there will be no bears on the road.
If you look a the s-curve, you also have to take the hype cycles into consideration.
My personal estimate is now a run up to between 15k and 25k and then a 50-70% correction before the next bull phase.

Just send all your funds from Jaxx to Bread. If it is a large fund, do a small test transaction first.

Lucky you!!
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:18:16
When you send a transaction, it is immediately visible in the target wallet. That is sufficient for small amounts.
Is it a large amount, you just wait an hour of two with this low fee for a confirmation , or pay a little more and have the confirmation within 20 minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:08:46

Buy Some first, not all your money, but a good chunk so you have some skin in the game. Then educate yourself more and more and more on bitcoin. Dollar cost averaging and Hodl is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:12:13
You can also install it on your own computer if you want, no problem!
Look here for the instructions and download:
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:18:13
It could correct anytime.
But it can as easily also now explode towards 25k and than correct to 40-50% back to 12K and then fly all the way to 50k or higher.
No one knows, so just dollar cost average and Hodl at any cost!

������ that’s why I started to mention the dollar. All wars are funded with the dollar (and a little bit in other fiat currencies). Did the inventor of the dollar foresee that? Euuhh duh! Of course! It is the reason the dollar and unchecked printing of the dollar was invented: to fund wars and black ops! So any malicious use of crypto is negligible compared to dollar usages for this. And oh now you mention it: drug cartels use the dollar and regular banks for their business, not bitcoin.
Did you know that the little personal bank vaults in banks on the border of Mexico are of a bigger size? To fit bigger boxes with dollars at the request of drug cartels...
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:30:31
Of course they can link bitcoin addresses to ip addresses and users and identities....it is a bit naive to think otherwise...

For good information go to: 
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:15:54
I know, but point is that this whole “bitcoin is used to buy drug” meme is utterly not interesting and not important at all. Crypto currencies are a medium of exchange and store of value. If you would ask: “oh? Would Satoshi have thought that bitcoin would be used to buy coffee or cars or houses??” is of equal value. 
It has nothing to do with bitcoin, it has everything to do with people and what they buy. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 17:30:59
Ehh no? What is the issue? Like I also heard a lot of horror stories about Poloniex, well I can tell you I never had 1 issue with them, perfect service.   Maybe if you are making really stupid mistakes like sending bcash to a bitcoin address or something that you will not be helped quickly, I don’t know, never had any issue with any exchange ever. I really don’t understand what people are talking about at all!
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:36:11
The problem here is not so much the world you are describing, as your inability to accept reality for what it is.

Use the custom derivation path" and start with m/0'/0
You should be able to manually go through addresses and get private keys by changing the path. (example: m/0'/0 --&gt; m/0'/1 --&gt; m/0'/2 )
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:22:40
Every currency that is widely accepted is being used to buy things. Drugs are part of that. Oh and now that you mention it; Bitcoin is not anonymous at all.

Miners Will have to follow the users (wallets) and Network nodes. Otherwise they mine in an empty altcoin Network. See for example BCash.
So make sure that you setup and run a core node version 0.15.0.1 to make the bitcoin Network stronger.
And Yes, you can also mine, but setting up a node is more important 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:51:39
 Ok, but as a user I always need to have the possibility to do a emergency portability.
For example if Apple blocks the app (they can be unreliable sometimes).

@_date: 2017-09-27 06:17:30

Bull: the breadwallet does ofcourse show the transaction id,, just click on the transaction for the details. 
Besides that, the transaction is visible within a couple of seconds in your wallet if your wallet is connected to the jnternet. 
(After that it takes 10-20 minutes for the transaction to be confirmed by the next mined blocks. But for small amounts that is irrelevant.)
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:41:23
Everybody run a 0.15 core bitcoin node!
It Will block the segwitx2 node
"Finally, it’s worth mentioning that Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 will disconnect from BTC1 peers on the network. This means that the Bitcoin network will experience less disruption if the SegWit2x hard fork splits the network, as both types of nodes will more easily find compatible peers. "

Ok, there are 100.000.000.000 xrp's at the moment,  (if ripple not decides to create more ripples, as xrp is a centralised crypto with one owner)

You are right about some wallets do not support good fee settings. Others do have them. 
But you are not right about the fees. I send btc regularly with the lowest fee (+-180 bits) and it is confirmed 3 times within 30 minutes till 1 hour.
 What I wonder about is this comfirmations.
The transaction is send within seconds!
Why should I wait for the extra conformations?

I mailed Jaxx to ask what their concrete actions are with the Jaxx wallet in relation to the coming alt-coin forks. Their answer was not satisfying.
Not clear. I still waiting for an definitive answer.
I got this answer:
“The facts that we have right now are:
- We have not decided to support Bitcoin Gold, there are still discussions floating around, no final decision but so far we won't
- Regarding the fork in November, based on the NY Agreement we will support the SegWit2x fork. Off course there is still time until November and we hope that the security necessary will be in place by that time (e.g. replay protection) so that our user's funds will be safe
- Given the ^ we have not yet made a decision if to support the non 2x chain but it may also depend on the mass adoption of that chain.
I hope this clears the air a little bit regarding Jaxx's plans.”
Hmmm I think I will move any coins that I have left in Jaxx to a safer place...

@_date: 2017-10-13 14:30:20
Your problem is that your node is not reachable for other nodes or wallets, hence only 8 connections out and 0 in.
Ok, try this one;
Fill in port 8333
Your public IP address should be filled in automatically.
Result must be: Port 8333 is open.
If the result is: Port 8334 is closed
There can be 4 reasons:
-wrong IP address filled in
-your node is down
-you must open up port 8333 in your firewall software on your pc.
-you must portforeward port 8333 in your router towards your private IP address of your node.

Woah! that are a lot of questions! You can ofcourse ask questions as much as you want. I think that any negative reaction to a question comes from the fact that 95% of the questions asked are easily found on Google within a minute of time. That is faster than posting and waiting for an answer. 
Researching yourself and if needed asking questions after that is always the better way to gain knowledge. 
But for you, I will have a go on your questions. I would kindly ask you not to believe me right away, but try to see if you can confirm with your own google search!
Q: There must be some risk investing in a currency that is completely digital.
A: Yes, ofcourse there is risk. There is risk in any asset class you invest in.
Q: I've seen mistakes in sending Bitcoin, almost made a few bad mistakes myself.
A: You could type in the wrong adress where you send Bitcoin to. So I would advice to use the QR code or to copy/past the adress and also do a visual check. Just as you would do with a bank transfer.
Q: How big is the blockchain?
A: The blockchain of Bitcoin is now 147Gb.
Q: How big will it get? 
A: That is hard to tell, it depends on the size of the blocks and the timespan you are talking about.
Q: Can the average person afford to run a full node? 
A: Yes, you only need a PC with 150GB free disk space and an internet connection. See here for how to setup a full node. It would strongly advice you to do so!:
Q: Where is all this blind faith coming from? 
A: It is not a blind faith, Bitcoin is just a very good piece of work and has risen out of its ashes 172 times:
Q: Is it just a total lack of faith in Central Banks?
A: Not at all, Crypto and Fiat currencies can coexist very well, as a matter of fact they do both quite succesfully!.
Yes, there are some people in the crypto space that are anti-(central) bank. But I can assure you, most are not. Both banks and crypto play a valuable role!
Q: Are crypto currencies the only alternative? 
A: This is hard to answer; the only alternative to exactly what?
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:29:29
Yes, as long you do not send or receive any coins during the fork, it does not matter if you are connected or not, not to what chain. Your coins are on the blockchain remember? Not in your wallet.

@_date: 2017-10-23 07:19:33
It does very much!
“A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.
Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network—they’ll have to use centralized services instead.”
So go and setup one your self!
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:03:53
 Nice work! And welcome to the Bitcoin sub!
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:58:30
You are fine concerning the fact that indeed you know on what network you are on after the fork. So if you would do a Bitcoin transaction directly after the fork with this setup, you are safe.
But it will not protect you from replay. So if you send BTC after the fork, this transaction is also possible and valid on the Segwitx2 chain. So you can lose your segwitx2 coins. And also the other way around. So if you would send Segwitx2 coins to someone, they can replay this transaction and get the same amount of bitcoins also from your address.
That’s why this whole Segwitx2 thing is a really bad idea.....

Yes I know as a programer myself that the management decisions and Development cycles can take a year or more before actual implementation. So we can expect that the BTC payment implementations that are comming online now, have been cooking for much longer time allready!
My point is, why is there so much noice and FUD, while at the same time BTC as a Payment System is being rolled out all over the world, regardless of price fluctuations. It is like an oiltanker that keeps on going no matter what, So what is all the fuss about?

Now you spread disinformation with this 3kilobit per second bandwith.
The truth is:
"A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second
An unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn’t exceed its upload limits. It’s common for full nodes on high-speed connections to use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month. Download usage is around 20 gigabytes a month, plus around an additional 140 gigabytes the first time you start your node."
And with segwit x2 the blocksize would double at least. So also double the data requirements

I understand your reaction very well.
How to help newcomers and remain patient at the same time.
I thought we had become the google generation?
But a lot of people seem to forget google and post simple questions.
It could also be because they are not comfortable with finding information on their own and need confirmation from an expert.
In that way, you act like  a knowledge node ��

@_date: 2017-10-02 05:23:15
With sx2 the blocks will be around 4mb in reality (8mb theoretical maximum).
Now you again do not respond to the facts I present, nor to the fact that for a good  functioning bitcoin Network (anti-replay, support other nodes and light wallets) you need more bandwith, this Information is easily found on the web.
And with segwitx2, the need for bandwith doubles.
So now  you use the tactics:
18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.'
5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issue
9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:32:08

Next to time in the market, there are two other strategies that are very sound on the long term:
-buy and hold: this trumps over 90% of even the most seasoned traders!

Ether is a good Solution for smart contractant with a big Network. But there is no cap to the amount of Ethereum that Will be created. So infinite inflation means it is not suitable as money or long term value storage.
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:05:23
Yes, you are both right, So we can only share our knowledge, without any expectations,

hmmm... that resistance must come now, we are allready on 4717!!
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:45:57
I think with bread wallet you can. Because you can choose the node you want to connect to: core or segwitx2. Replay is still possible of course.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:54:32
The same reason it suddenly past 10, 100, 1000, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:32:30
Great work!
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:10:54
Hashpower is not king. In Bitcoin it are the users that are king.
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:24:54
The facts are that with segwitx2 the block size doubles to a 4 Mb average up to 8mb.
The block chain would increase massively in size and this will push out people with low bandwidth.
And the worst of it all is that the blocksize increase is not needed at all at this moment. The current blocks are big enough until we have better solutions such as lighting in place.
So stop pushing this agenda to try to centralize Btc!
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:14:35
Great work!!!
Make sure it is a Bitcoin core node Satoshi 0.15 or higher!
And open up port 8333 in your firewall and port foreward this port 8333 in your router towards your full node!
For all info!!
Spread the word!!
(Corrected the portnumber to 8333)
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:54:14
There is no Segwit1X.
There is only Bitcoin and forks of that are altcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:48:46
And another vote as Well!
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:07:33
Well done! Great achievement!
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:41:36
You as a user can choose the chain. But just waiting a day or two when the dust has settled is wise to do with any svp wallet! 
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:00:03
They should be safe in Jaxx, they make sure your coins are safe. I would still make no transactions directly after the fork until Jaxx says it’s safe.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:06:13
Always good if your girlfriend wants more!!!
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:37:20
That’s not true, you can choose to what chain you are syncing with! 
Mind you that this problem goes for all the svp light wallets out there! At least with bread you can choose and they are open about it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:43:25
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:25:16
It is not the majority hashpower, but the validation of blocks and transactions by the nodes that counts.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:21:03
Yes, I run the full node on a mini pc of 200 bucks.
Works really well!
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:27:58
Nice! Ask all your webshops to add btc as a payment option!
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:28:09
Upgrade to 0.15.0.1!!
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:45:17
Doesn’t matter, just relax, it will show up!
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:22:34
Well, this is a Bitcoin sub, so for altcoin advise I would go to the respective subs.
Ledger is always a good option!
(Ps: doge has huge inflation and ripple is not a crypto coin)
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:00:59
The nodes validate the transactions and blocks and add them to the blockchain only if validate.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:52:23
Run a full node!
For all Info!
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:02:33
Now 15%. The thing is, the volume is so low, it doesn’t really have a meaning yet.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:20:37
Yes and also to open up port 8333 in your firewall on the pc that runs the full node!
You can test your success on:
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:08:24
In the breadwallet, You click on the transaction to show the details.
Then you click on the transaction ID and copy it.
Then you paste it here on reddit as a comment.
Or you check the transaction yourself on:
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:39:48
The point is that users who run a Bitcoin core full node are the ones that verify and confirm (or reject) all transactions. So miners will comply to the users to be sure to get the blocks and transactions confirmed.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:33:30
Always better to have more exposure to Bitcoin than to altcoin a as they are much more speculative.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:39:54
This post has nothing to do with Bitcoin, but with criminal activities. You should never engage in any activity that is remotely criminal or have any contact with a criminal.
On a side note: do you guys notice that a lot of these posts pop up lately? Asking about trying to do do taxes-fraud or engaging in other criminal activities.
Almost if some party is fishing for people or ways how people do it. Just don’t!
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:03:32

Yes that is safe too, although I would at a minimum laminate the pieces of Pater!!
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:45:50
Use version 0.15.0.1
And don’t forget to open up port 8333 in your firewall.
And also in your router to set port-foreword of port 8333 towards your IP address of your full node!

@_date: 2017-10-06 19:13:45
Yes, so just buy and hold and make sure you have control of your own bitcoins by holding the private keys in the form of the 12 word pass phrase.
So buy on an exchange, but hold in your wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:48:15

Ehm... no.
Segwit is allready implemented.
The segwitx2 folks want to push small nodes out and take corporate control of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:22:07
Port 8333; Port fore-warded this port in your router towards your private ip address of your full node.
And open up port 8333 in the software firewall on your pc.

@_date: 2017-10-08 18:35:01
Just buy every month for an amount you can easily miss. And then HOLD!
What you also can do is buy stuff with BTC and replenish immediately your BTC (and some more ��),
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:48:27
Correct 
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:16:26
In a sense it might even be usefull, the powers that be are trying to stop the crypto revolution. But that cannot be stopped ofcourse. So the net result is a more gradual change, which is actually quite good if you think about it!
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:50:27
And yet again, you do not respons to the Information in my reply.
You use the following tactic:
 9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.
Why do you do that?
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:19:34
Just buy and hold!
And dollar cost average.
So just buy every month, for the amount you can miss.
That strategy beats everything.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:21:53
Kraken, Gdax (coinbase), bitfinex, etc there are a lot of exchanges where you can get them!

You will need more than 8 connections.
Also some connections in.
Open up port 8333 in your firewall and also portforeward port 8333 in your router towards the ipaddress of your full node
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:00:16
Yes, The ShapeShift inside the jaxx wallet works very good and fast most of the time.
It depends on ShapeShift and they again trade it on an Exchange.
Jaxx is the best wallet out there for small amounts, as the security is not the best (esp. on Android). For better security use Breadwallet or Mycelium wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:00:38
I hope you are good there install and run a full node!
The more the better.

Bcash is an altcoin, like other forks in the past that have forked off Bitcoin. So you can discuss Bcash altcoin on the other subs! 
We are all moderators when it comes to altcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:22:57
Yes, alt CAN give you a lot of BTC. Once in a while suddenly everyone gets totally loco! And altcoins suddenly explode out of nowhere! Happend before and probably will happen again. Most alts are useless, as they are not different from BTC but lack the user base, network, etc. But if an alt has a really good feature, that feature will be adopted by BTC! If the alt does not have an extra feature, it is totally worthless. There might be some alts that really have a complete different usecase from BTC. That might get interesting!
Corrected typo.

Euuhhh.. this is allready reality man!
The other day over a couple of beers I set up a friend in a matter of 1 hour:
-explained the nature of distributed ledger
-explained the nature of BTC: Nodes, miners, wallets, payments, limited cap on production.
-downloaded Mycelium 
-sent him some satoshis
-he sent me some back (Lowest fee of course).
-let him Buy for 50 dollar at a direct buying service.
The only thing left is the bip39 secret key that he has to write down at Home.
He liked it

I really like this Great cryptonews aggregator. I think it automaticly crawls the web and post any crypto news on there. You could check it out!
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:25:57
Oh! I’m sorry you mis-interpreted my response!
What I meant is that we (all redditors here! So also you and me) are all moderators when it comes to guarding the scope of r/Bitcoin.
If we would allow to discuss altcoins, where is the limit? There are hundreds of altcoins! 
So for your understanding, I’m not an official moderator on this sub. But i just want to stay on topic and discuss Bitcoin and no altcoins!
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:01:13
Buy Bitcoin, after a fork you will have your coins on both chains, so no need to worry about hardforks.
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:33:56
 
There are a lot of different initiatives for Bitcoin scaling that are being worked on right now!
Segwit was the precursor for this.
Expanding blocksize is not the way to go, it will not give us the scaling that is needed, but it will centralize the nodes, what we do not want of course.

Off topic, 
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:59:50
buy when others are fearfull, sell when others are high.
Blood in the streets etc...
But in the end: buy and hold and dollar cost averaging wins all the time!!! do not trade, do not sell at a loss!!
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:58:53

Start here for good info;
And also in the right banner on this screen!

First set up a core node om your pc.
That is the best way to make the Network more strong! And push out the segwitx2 altcoin:
Real easy; For installation help look at:
And in the bitcoin configuration file (settings, options), you have to put in the following Line: 
Ps: do not forget to check your node at:
There you can check if your node is connected!
Otherwise, make sure you port-foreward the port number 8333 in your router to your pc.
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:41:13
That last one is really nice and clean and could be easily made in a metal shop.

@_date: 2017-10-15 03:22:44
I don’t know, have the same question. They do not respond to support questions 
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:28:14
The hardest part is that you need the long term perspective. Even if Bitcoin would half in value or even more: Hodl! And buy small amounts every month. If this train will continue, you will get on top!

Why 40k?
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:03:20
Yes, I would not wonder me if price is now directly linked to he amount of BTC that people take of the exchanges!
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:20:28
Yes it does, it keeps the altcoin x2 out of the bitcoin Network 
@_date: 2017-09-24 09:34:15
Aha! I see a Nice Role for the banks here, they keep your private key in a safe place for you. ������
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:47:26
That is not correct! Bread did not sign the NYA agreement at all ��
They have no own servers, so you have to connect your bread svp wallet directly to the btc network.
So what they have done is very smart: you can connect bread to the node of your choice!
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:10:40
Even more interesting:

Canaan.io is a better alternative 
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:41:42
Because if you run a full node with the whole block chain, you support other users who want to setup a new node. So they can download the blockchain from you.
Next to that, you validate the whole blockchain when downloading the complete chain!
If you prune, this is not possible
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:46:55
Perfect answer! This is the right mindset, base the discussions on facts and not on popularity.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:28:46
Just do it! Run a full node!
Read here how to set it up:
You only need a pc and approximately 150-200 gb of free disk space and an internet connection.
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:07:02
Not at all! Just recently a lot of new members are entering r Bitcoin and they all keep asking the same questions over and over again. So old timers get a little tired of that ��.
I would advise to look at the banner to the right and start reading!
Concerning the crypto currency; Bitcoin is by far the biggest and already widespread over the globe. That we call the network effect. No other altcoin can even overtake that! If an altcoin has a better feature, Bitcoin will get that feature also (although it might take some time). If an altcoin doesn’t, it’s 100% useless.
Only an altcoin with a totally different usecase as Bitcoin has can be interesting!
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:20:04
Real easy solution!
In Bread you can choose your node!
So in settings, node thetering, just fill in the ip adress of a bitcoin core 0.15 node that is up 100%.
You can find them here:
Bread is still one of the most safe mobile wallets!
You could also setup a node yourself, that is even better!
You can also use these wallets, they connect to their own nodes, which are Bitcoin Core nodes:
-Greenadress  
Good wallet, android and IOS.
-Mycelium 
Good wallet Andriod, IOS is not well supported imo.
JAXX also connect to their own nodes. But now they say that they support segwitx2. So if you use JAXX, you will not be connected to the Bitcoin Network! be warned.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:53:46
Ehhhh electrum has servers, bread not. Bread connects directly to the network.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:46:17
Yes, MANY Thanks and respect to the breadwallet team and the superb Quality of the breadwallet So far! Very happy customer! 
Only question I have is Why you choose for a slightly less standard interpretation of the BIP39 passphrase key. As it seem to differ from most other wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:41:14
Completely off topic! You should respond to the content of his message: Segwitx2 being a bankers Trojan horse!
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:44:19
Run a full node!!
Use version 0.15.0.1
And don’t forget to open up port 8333 in your firewall.
And also in your router to set port-foreword of port 8333 towards your IP address of your full node!
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:55:48

@_date: 2017-10-12 20:23:24
Unless you can connect your wallet to your own full node, like with Breadwallet, at least they promise us they will deliver as a function.
Or with a desktop wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:53:30
No it is not, it are the users who decide.
I understand that the concept takes some time to get used to. We have come to believe that power should be in the hand of some authority.
But with Bitcoin it is not, the power is with the users who decide what to support.

@_date: 2017-10-08 10:36:17


@_date: 2017-10-23 08:46:18
Yes, but nodes validate if all Bitcoin rules are uphold. Otherwise you could submit a fake block

The cold hard fact is that over 90% of all people lose in trading,
Just buy and hold and dollar average with your buying. And do not sell at a loss,
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:10:52
Well.... legally the money in your bank account is not yours. It is owned by the bank. So it is quite naturally that the bank wants to know where THEIR money came from and what you want to do with THEIR money! 
It may sound absurd, but it is a fact!
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:24:06
Nice! Now make every month a small additional buy, regardless of price!
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:42:34
you are ok and you can send as it is confirmed.
Don’t worry, you can never lose your Bitcoin this way, not even when the btc is not confirmed yet,
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:36:11
It is about expanding user base. That is growing exponential nowadays.....
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:37:34
That is not true at all. After a fork you control the keys to your coins on both Blockchains: the bitcoins and the altcoin swx2.

Ok, so governments and banks are essentially the same group. Yes there are off course some evil man behind the curtain, but don’t forget that a very large group of people also greatly benefit of the system.
So it is not only us vd them. Otherwise people would revolt. Yes, the economic system usually ends in war or debt implosion, but that is also a reflection of the current awareness of the common man.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:15:39
Yes, it is also about centralizing Bitcoin by creating bigger blocks so that fewer people can run a full node. It is the same as with Bitcoin unlimited, a failed attempt.

“A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.
Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network—they’ll have to use centralized services instead.”

Demand and supply must be balanced by definition, as it is bounded by the physical reality of the number of items that are being traded in any given moment in time. So the only parameter left is price. And that will behave as I described in my reaction.

With sx2 the blocks will be around 4mb in reality (8mb theoretical maximum).
Now you again do not respond to the facts I present, nor to the fact that for a good  functioning bitcoin Network (anti-replay, support other nodes and light wallets) you need more bandwith, this Information is easily found on the web.
And with segwitx2, the need for bandwith doubles.
So now  you use the tactics:
18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.'
5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issue
9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.

“What Is A Full Node?
A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.

If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network—they’ll have to use centralized services instead.
Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resources—but more volunteers are needed to allow Bitcoin to continue to grow. “

Nodes validate transactions before they can be mined and nodes also validate mined blocks and put them on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:34:00
Welcome to this great space!
You can certainly contribute.
The most important thing to do is setup your own full core node:
This way you support the network by validating the transactions. Make sure you open up port 8333 in your firewall and portforeward 8333 to your full node in your router. In this way, you support light wallets and other new nodes to be set up!
Next to that, get some Bitcoin and start using it to buy products and services. Replenish your bitcoins directly afterwards.
Success and welcome to the beautiful world of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:47:11

Nodes are the only ones that validate transactions and blocks and add them to the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:05:00
This is also very relevant for all the users. Especially for light wallets like mobile wallets. They connect to the full Bitcoin core nodes to validate their transactions! So running a full node is as important as mining!
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:08:40
That is some good advice indeed: buy btc with the dollars you can miss!
Next to that: buy every month and maybe a little more when there is a dip.
And if you can, also run a full node on your pc:
As Bitcoin still really has to become mainstream adopted, you will be amazed by the returns you will get on your investment once it gets there!

Yes, indeed that is the solution for all SVP wallets!
What do you think? Other light wallets do not have this issue? Bread gives the sensible option to connect to the chain you want! And hopefully they can automate this a bit for users without a full node.
We still have to see how other light wallets handle this! Like Jaxx....

The functionality of Bcash is less than BTC, because it lacks Segwit. And they lack the development power that core has.
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:21:25
Well... i mailed them to ASK what the plans are.
What do you know? This is the answer:
“The facts that we have right now are:
- We have not decided to support Bitcoin Gold, there are still discussions floating around, no final decision but so far we won't
- Regarding the fork in November, based on the NY Agreement we will support the SegWit2x fork. Off course there is still time until November and we hope that the security necessary will be in place by that time (e.g. replay protection) so that our user's funds will be safe
- Given the ^ we have not yet made a decision if to support the non 2x chain but it may also depend on the mass adoption of that chain.
I hope this clears the air a little bit regarding Jaxx's plans.”
You can understand my reply, I’m not amused! 
This will mean the end of Jaxx if they do not turn around!

They present the block to the network for the nodes to validate. If the nodes agree that the block is validated, only then the block is added to the blockchain.

You need to open up port 8333 in your firewall on your full node pc.
And in your router you need to port-foreward port 8333 to the ip-adress of your full node pc.
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:06:47
To good thing about crypto is that you do not need any consent or approval to use it! You can just start today!
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:51:17
Just install bitcoin core version  0.15.0.1
And also open up port 8333 in your firewall.
And also port-foreward port 8333 in your router to your full node.
In that way you also help the light wallets and other new nodes to sync.
Keep on installing those core nodes!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:52:14
Good wallets are: bread and mycelium.
Make sure you write down your 12 words in a safe place.
Also setup a full node if you have a pc and want to support the network:
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:56:50
No the miners do not control the Bitcoin rules at all! The rules are uphold by the users that run a Bitcoin core node on their computer.
Why do you keep spreading mis-information?
There is no place for that in here.

bullshit! Bread does not have servers, so the bread wallet connects directly to the blockchain. They cannot control the node you connect to. But you can control that yourself, in the settings you can connect to a Bitcoin Core node: 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:39:15
You will have the choice with breadwallet to choose the chain, so that is very good!
And if they can also work around the replay protection thing, even better!
And they are very vocal about it. 
The question is how other Wallets are going to handle this f*ckup with this bx2 coin?

If you really had a full node from 2011, you would not be talking about pruning. You would run a full node, and open up the connections for other nodes and lightwallets. To support the Network as best as possible. And you would also know that storage is not the biggest issue, it is relative cheap (50 euro for 1 Tb). And this gets cheaper every year.
And you would also know that internet bandwith is not scalable for users by them selves. Especially not in 2nd and 3rd world countries. 
So we do not want big blocks, because that leads to centralization.
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:26:51
You are welcome, I hope it will also educate you (when you are doing your own research to validate or reject my answers).
There is not really an alternative for a (central) bank at the moment besides cryptocurrencies. Other solutions like gold are not suitable for our digital age. So in that sense, yes cryptocurrencies are the only viable alternative at the moment.

Yes, backed by the guns of the government to be precise. 
Bitcoin is backed by the blockchain and is independent and decentralized.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:15:47
Two reasons:
1) gold is really paper gold and it is shorted to death by the big banks. There is now more than 200-300 more paper gold than there’s actual physical gold!
2) the current population has been brainwashed not to see the value of gold anymore. And only the baby boomers have experienced the last inflation bound. They are selling their gold for retirement. The lesser numbers of new buyers buy only paper gold (see 1).
The banks have this gold effectively under control.

Yes, alt CAN give you a lot of btc. Once in a while suddenly everyone gets totally loco! And altcoins suddenly explode out of nowhere!
Happend before and probably will happen again.
Most alts are useless, as they are no differently then BTC but lack the user base, network, etc.
But if an alt has a really good feature, it will be adopted by BTC!
There might be some alts that really have a complete different usecase from BTC. That might get interesting!

 stop spreading dis-information.
What Is A Full Node?
A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.
Bitcoin Core is programmed to decide which block chain contains valid transactions. The users of Bitcoin Core only accept transactions for that block chain, making it the Bitcoin block chain that everyone else wants to use
It is these users who keep Bitcoin decentralized. They individually run their own Bitcoin Core full nodes, and each of those full nodes separately follows the exact same rules to decide which block chain is valid.
There’s no voting or other corruptible process involved: there’s just individual software following identical rules—”math”—to evaluate identical blocks and coming to identical conclusions about which block chain is valid.
This shared agreement (called consensus) allows people like you to only accept valid bitcoins, enforcing Bitcoin’s rules against even the most powerful miners.

Post your transaction ID here.

@_date: 2017-10-07 14:44:51
The blocksize was allready doubled from 1mb to 2mb, along with the segwit implementation. This is by far efficient enough; fees are very low and the transactions get very fast confirmations. No need to double the blocksize again.

Raising of the block size has recently been done with the introduction of Segwit. It was also a doubling of the block size in a smart way. There is nothing against raising block size when it is absolutely needed. And it will probably happen again in the future. But only when it is needed to accommodate more on chain transactions. The downside is the extra bandwidth and storage you need, which can lead to centralized nodes when pushed to the extreme.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:50:05

If you connect to a core node, you know for sure what network you are on. Otherwise you will not know during the fork. That is also no problem, unless you send Bitcoin during the fork period. Because your wallet might connect to the wrong network.

The $100 you just bought, or the price of 1 btc?
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:53:38
We have now:
1 Bitcoin is 1.000.000 Bits
1 Bitcoin is 100.000,000 Satoshi 
So now 1 dollar is 200 bits or 20.000 Satoshi 
Let’s see when 100 bits is 1 dollar.
Then 1 bit equals 1 cent.
So that is at btc= 10.000 dollar, so one more a doubling ��

Yes, you are 100% right! There can be real gems in the ICO white paper space! But 95% of all ICO’s will go bust... act accordingly

Yes, your coins will be safe for the fork. If you have your own private keys (mnemonic phrase of 12 or 24 words) you are the only one that can access your coins! So make sure that you do not lose them!!
Your coins are not in a Mobile wallet, the coins are on the blockchain that is available on every Bitcoin Core Node. Your mobile wallet contains the private keys that allow you to access your coins on the blockchain. 
With bread you can connect to the Bitcoin Core Network as I described. But you can also connect to the Segwitx2 network if that becomes relevant. Just make sure you do not send any coins during the fork late November. First see that the network is stable.

With sx2 the blocks will be around 4mb in reality (8mb theoretical maximum).
Now you again do not respond to the facts I present, nor to the fact that for a good  functioning bitcoin Network (anti-replay, support other nodes and light wallets) you need more bandwith, this Information is easily found on the web.
And with segwitx2, the need for bandwith doubles.
So now  you use the tactics:
18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.'
5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issue
9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.

If you look at the long term resistance, somewhere between 15k-25k would be a nice target.
Then a 40-50% correction.

Who knows if there is a windows version of the script?

Hmmm well taxes are a very local thing. I personally always pay them and are proud to do so!
But in your case I would search a tax advisor for help, maybe there is a way in your jurisdiction.

Just relax guys. This is normal operations. In the Netherlands Bank must handle bitcoin equal to cash. So if you would deposit 100K cash at your bank, they also must ask questions. To check if it not illegal or launderd money. The same goes for Crypto

That is the good spirit! We UXTO families should not fight each other, but support each other! We have a crypto mission, to root out monetary corruption, so we better work together! I love Bitcoin too!
