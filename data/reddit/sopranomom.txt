I second the idea of googling the wallet address. Someone may have it in their .sig. Yes, finders keepers in Bicoinlandia, but there's room for decent people too, always.

Yep, and came to it independently. SO has zero interest.

There's a shiver-worthy discussion going on over on [Bitcointalk]( Highly recommended, but not light reading.

"If you have had balance shown on Inputs.io, we're dividing up the coins we do have left based on a sliding scale, and have sent it to the specified address."   
Not yet, not in my case anyway.  Had some on inputs.io, and a larger amount on Coinlenders.  
**EDIT: Got much of the amount on inputs.io back. Still waiting on the larger amount in Coinlenders.**

Fifty-something housewife, former single mom, BA, diffidently mining since 2011. Wish I'd done more. Thought email ( then called "messaging" and done over BBSs and bang paths) and computerized homes were the next big thing in the early 80s, and got involved with a company that was installing Commodores in new condos. It....didn't go well. Not then.
Having learned a lesson about timing, I didn't completely throw myself into mining, figuring adoption was gonna be 20 years out, if then. Damn damn damn damn...

"bump", unfortunately.

Reddit as a faucet. Why are you giving BTC away?

From their [homepage:](
"The site crash a bit ago was due to an infinite loop in some test code. Not related to any DDoS. ;) As the site grows I hope to be able to afford more servers so I can isolate things more. Until then, my apologies for the interruption.

Between the ongoing ddos attacks and today being dividend day for ASICminer, I'd be more surprised to see it up and running flawlessly.
Per Burnside, "The bottleneck is bitcoind.  I spent a bunch of time last night working on shifting requests away from bitcoind, that code is live now on litecoinglobal.com.  If it holds up, I'll roll it out to btct.co soon.  Eventually we'll shift everything but deposits/withdrawals out of bitcoind, but it will be a very slow process unfortunately."
