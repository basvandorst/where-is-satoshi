Power consumption was a huge driver in profitability when GPUs were mining, but since ASICs have taken over, capital costs have all but completely eclipsed power costs. Even older generation ASICs are still very profitable compared to their power costs, but not compared to the purchase price.

The problem is that you can't force people buying from you to not buy in $1 increments. If you put up 1BTC for sale, anyone can buy small parts of that; they don't have to buy it all at once.

It doesn't seem like it would be a likely situation, but it happens more than you would think. Whenever there is a large gap between the buy and sell where there is low volume, trader bots will try to take advantage of that. A few hundred dollars is nothing in terms of volume. All sorts of situations can happen with volatility.

The whole thing is a little under-developed and doesn't really seem necessary. As mentioned earlier, there was no statement of the timezone which determines when "Midnight" occurs. Also, it doesn't say where the price comes from; is it Gox? Another exchange? The Dev's head?
There is no benefit to betting early, so why wouldn't you wait to bet at the last second? These kind of bets are already on BetsOfBitcoin, so why duplicate that here with fewer features?

Sounds awesome but sentences like this worry me a bit:
"After going over the financials today I think it makes sense to change the 1069.99 unit to the 54Gh/s model and sell the design originally intended for 27Gh/s at 599.99"
If the chips themselves don't cost much each, then why is the 54Gh/s version twice as expensive? The main cost of ASIC fab is the upfront non-recurring cost of design and initial masks. If the chips themselves to cost quite a bit each, then you don't just look "over the financials today" and decide to cut the price in half/double the number of chips. 
Maybe the markup that bASIC is making is enough to be able to pull this sort of thing, but I remain skeptical. This sort of willy-nilly business decision doesn't sit well with me at all.

You should take the battery *especially* if it is plugged in all the time. The batteries in laptops like to be kept at room temperature and about 50-60% capacity. Mining would force charging and discharging around 100% at extended periods of time at a higher temperature.
I have friends that game on laptops, and the difference between those who pop the battery out and those who don't is astounding. After a year, two identical laptops can have 20-30% difference in total capacity after just *one year*.

I think you're wrong about it being non-controversial. I think changing the block size would be highly controversial:
- When the block rewards drop even further, the miners will have to rely on transaction fees in order to profit/break even. If the block size increases, those transaction fees will drop significantly, seriously lowering miner profit.
- It would cause a software schism that we would _like_ to avoid if we can (for some things, it's impossible to avoid). Since a large portion of people (miners) would do better on the old software, and another large portion of people (tx-ers) would do better on the new software, we could have a pretty serious situation to take care of.
- I am not 100% sure of this, but I think that a new block size would change the mining process just slightly; it would change enough that any dedicated mining hardware like ASICs would cease to work. And since the ASICs are specifically design to work with the current process, and the current process only, they would become completely useless. The miners would not enjoy being forced to throw out their hardware.
Basically, I'm just saying that there would be pressure from both sides, one for keeping it the same, and one for changing it. It could get ugly.

I did read the announcement, and wasn't trying to take anything out of context. He talked about the conference call with the board and chip fab, and then said we'd have a choice between power connectors.

@_date: 2012-09-02 02:36:28
Ah yes, I see now. They do have a couple of things like that. The term they usually use is "mining contract". There are two ways (generally) that a mining contract can pay out:
1) You buy a mining contract for a certain amount of time, and you are guaranteed a certain MH/s (mega-hashes per second). This is the more popular way, because it reduces risk for the miner, therefore reducing cost for the investor. But if technology changes, like if the ASICs for BFLabs come out anytime soon, then the 1GH/s you paid for suddenly loses a large amount of value.
2) You buy a mining contract for a certain amount of time, and you are guaranteed a certain amount of BTC/day (or week or whatever). This is riskier on the miner, for the same reasons as in (1), so the miner pays out less in order to cover this risk.
I haven't checked in a while, but I know [ferroh]( has a market for trading mining contracts, and I believe there are many on the GLBSE as well. I've never bought or sold a mining contract, but I can vouch for ferroh; the guy certainly knows his stuff, and is great to deal with. (not affiliated in any way, or anything like that)

The last comment by the author of the article:
"Wait, no Bitcoin company? So who is empowered to issue Bitcoins?"
I'm not sure that he gets it. Plus, while the FDIC protects those individuals that lost money in a theft, it hurts those that did not lose money in the theft. The value of each unit of a currency decreases when more units are added to the system, so it's really a distribution of wealth from those that did not lose money to those that did.
I'm not saying that I agree or disagree with how the FDIC works, I just don't think that many people understand the difference between the amount of wealth you control and the number of dollars you have.

Hypothetical Scenario:

Person B has a buy order at $9 for 1BTC
Person C has a sell order at $11 for 1BTC
No other orders exists.
Now, Person D comes by and buys 1 BTC at market value ($10). Last price is now $10. 
Person E comes along and puts in a sell order at $9.01/BTC. 
Now we have a last price of $10, highest buy price of $9, and a lowest sell price of $9.01.

This title is misleading. Not only has the EU NOT banned anything yet, this would also only apply to new sales.

It's both, really. Leaving it at 100% degrades the battery at a much faster rate than leaving it at 60%.

The problem with something like this is that it would be implemented in client software. If a timeout were implemented, and I got a hold of your wallet, I wouldn't be using the client that had this implemented to brute force it. Many of the clients are open source, so an attacker knows what the encryption algorithm is, so they would probably be using already-made cracking software or roll their own.

Actually, it's slightly profitable for me to CPU mine LTC than not at all. Pushing my CPU to 100% utilization costs me ~$0.10/day more in electricity, and I make about 5LTC/day. At the current exchange rate of approximately 0.0027BTC/LTC and $11.69USD/BTC, I make about $0.15/day, less the power cost. Overall, $0.05/day isn't much, but if my rig is going to be running for BTC anyway, I might as well take advantage of every little extra bit I can.

About your first example. The problem happens when you charge, let's say 20% more than the fiat price for Arduino stuff, and then I charge 20% more for my widgets, and then I spend it on doodads that some other guys is charging 20% more for. The buying power of a Bitcoin has now been reduced by 1/6, just by keeping it "in the loop". Also, when you sell a bitcoin for fiat, it's not going anywhere, just to someone else.
And I do understand the value of being able to spend BTC instead of selling it, but that value is negated when businesses charge a markup for this "value".
I do see that the prices are a bit more reasonable now, even though I can buy an R3 UNO for $14.50 shipped. The thing about places like Sparkfun is that they add value by providing spectacular customer service, a comments/forum system, tutorials, reference designs, an easy-to-use shopping interface, as well as a huge selection of products that they design and build themselves. I personally don't use Sparkfun very often, because I don't need many of those things that they offer, but I can still see the value that they add to their products.
Low transaction fees and easy of transfer is an amazing benefit of using Bitcoin, as long as that isn't overshadowed by high fees imposed by the seller.

That's the problem with many of these BTC "businesses". Most just buy things in fiat to resell at a higher price it BTC. Not only is the price higher, it's often from a less reputable seller than if you had just bought it with fiat.
I don't feel that this helps, there's no value added here. Is it any easier to get? No. Is it cheaper? No. Is it better? No. 
This is just trying to capitalize on a false monopoly: "I'm the only one selling this for Bitcoin, so I can charge more for it!" 
Bitcoin doesn't need more "shops" like this. If you're offering a service or product at price competitive to ones in other markets, then that is great. Doing something unique is awesome.  Using the private nature of Bitcoin to sell less-than-public items works too.

I agree with gox, that you'll probably be pulling in 0.17 to 0.2 BTC/day with your rig in a mining pool. That's around 5.6 BTC a month (~$50 at today's exchange rate).
If you have the rig already, mining can be one of the cheapest ways to get into Bitcoin. If your electricity rate is low enough (or free!), then it can even be profitable. Where I live, it's 8.5-9.0 cents/kWh, so I leave my miner on all the time. 
Edit: Also, the only spec that really matters is your GFX performance. It's not worth the hassle, electricity, and strain on your system to mine with your CPU. To get started, look up "guiminer"; it's pretty easy to get it up and running, but if you need help, let me know!

Also, about taxes: can you pay for taxes in gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, oil? Does that mean none of those are useful any more? Are they going to fade away into obsolescence because you can't pay the government with them?
Bitcoin does not have to replace fiat in order to be successful. The two can exist simultaneously, just like how gold can exsist beside printed money.

I don't mind shipping outside of the US, it'll just cost a little more in shipping (about 1 BTC extra, last time I checked).


It really comes down to a case-by-case basis, depending on the complexity of the shapes, type of material, amount of raster/engraved detail required, and other complexities (like two sided engraving). My general rule of thumb is 0.10 BTC per minute of laser time. In 1/8" acrylic, that roughly corresponds to an 8" line. I'm glad to look at designs and give an accurate estimate based on the desired material.


I think it has to do with the idea of open-manufacturing with a symbol of an open currency. Also, laser-cutters are pretty sweet machines; you have computer, an invisible laser, and your imagination.

BTC on GPU (dual 6850's), and LTC on CPU (i5). If you're going to mine on a laptop, I would take out the battery first. If you don't, it'll kill your battery, and it won't be worth the cost of a new battery. Same goes for gaming, unplug the battery if you're going to be gaming for a bit, and you can put it back in later. Unless you have a Mac, swapping the battery in and out is painless (generally).

Think of the VC's though. They probably want USD returns on their USD investments. If Butterfly Labs were to take a huge chunk of the bitcoin economy, that could seriously endanger their ability to sell the devices for USD. The ability to exchange BTC for USD is not a sure thing, and could vary wildly by the time they release the product. 
Also, when they make the next version of the machines, they want to have the trust of the people buying them. That's why they are offering the trade-in deal for the old hardware. If they cared only for the short term, they wouldn't care about making their old customers happy. As a long-term manufacturer, it would make more sense to keep providing better and better products as the technology changes.
Just my opinion on the matter. Take it for what you will.
@_date: 2012-09-02 02:00:05
I'm not quite sure what you're asking. There are some groups/individuals that mine for a source of income, and they often find cheap places for rent that have low electricity costs. They may have many many rigs running, with many GFX cards in each rig. They may also run some FPGA miners.
This doesn't prevent them from mining in a pool. Generally, pool mining gets you a steady, low-risk income stream, while with individual mining, you may make 50BTC every once in a while, or you may not. With a pool, you only lose about 3% to fees. Even with a large mining operation, it may still make sense to mine as part of a pool.
Is that what you're asking?
@_date: 2012-09-15 13:42:09
There are exchanges that allow you to trade LTC, Namecoin, etc. for BTC. If you wanted you could then exchange BTC for USD, but I personally keep my mining profits in BTC.
Some (very few, but some) services also accept LTC as payment, so that is another way to "cash out".

It's generally not a good idea to put money into a ponzi that is winding down. Last I checked, the total deposit pool was at 419BTC. That means that if you were to put in 1BTC, there would have to be *at least* 420BTC in deposits after you to break even. That number goes up if it's a bunch of smaller deposits.
I don't think that there is another $5k that people are willing to put into this. My guess is that any new deposits will not break even.

Right, but you're assuming the dividends would remain constant. If the USD-value of BTC were to increase dramatically, more people will mine, which would decrease the dividends. At some point, they _could_ decrease to a point where it would have been more worthwhile to have held onto BTC.

The problem with that scheme is that the difficulty and hash rate also determine the time between blocks. Difficulty is adjusted is every 2016 blocks.
If half of the miners were to stop after a difficulty change, it would take about four weeks to mine all of the blocks required for another difficulty adjustment. Then all of the miners would switch back on, and it would take about a week to mine through the block. So instead of mining a number of coins in four weeks, you would mine the same number of coins in five weeks.

You can still play games and do graphics-intensive tasks while mining; I always keep my rig mining and it's also my day-to-day machine.

I believe that is because there is a flat fee associated with purchases. So if there is a flat fee of, say, $1 and they'll sell each BTC for $20, buying a smaller amount of coin will make the per-unit cost of BTC go up. If you buy 100BTC, that $1 becomes insignificant, and the per-unit cost of BTC approaches $20.

That doesn't really change anything. Regardless of whether a character was replaced or removed, the number of possible private keys is the same (technically, we have 30 fewer keys to try than if it were just missing completely).  Assuming you're using a minikey, there are 58 possible characters for each of the 30 positions in the key. This means there are only 57*30=1,710 possible keys to try before exhausting all possibilities. 
Dropping half of the private key helps, but at that point, you might as well have generated a private key with a brain-wallet phrase.

Why does it matter how much there is in a single address? If you split that amount between two addresses, you'd be twice as likely to hit one of the two addresses. The expected value of "mining" addresses is the same, as long as the total number of BTC is the same.
It's still not profitable, but the number of coins in a single address doesn't really affect the profitability.

I don't think the issue of client-side cryptography really applies here. From what I can tell, the attacker was able to get at the _encrypted_ private keys, and cracked the passwords to some of those keys. The same sort of attack could apply to bc.info if someone were to gain access to the encrypted private keys on the server.
In both Strongcoin's and Blockchain.info's cases, a sufficiently strong password/passphrase would thwart such an attack; if you have a weak password, client-side cryptography doesn't help you a bit.

Just because their profit, income, dividends, etc. are all denominated in BTC, does *_not_* mean that they are completely decoupled from and unaffected by the fiat value of BTC. Time to provide another example:
If ASICMiner decides to sell a widget today for 1 BTC, you would think to yourself, "I suppose that is a good price, perhaps I will buy one." Now, fast-forward a few weeks/months/years where 1 BTC can buy you 10,000 USD, and the purchasing power of the USD has remained relatively constant (a decrease of a few percent per year). ASICMiner is still selling their widget for 1 BTC. You would no longer think that is a good price for the widget at all! They would no longer be able to sell widgets at that price, because there would be a very low quantity of widgets demanded at that price. They make no sales, the value of their company drops as a result.
Now, I know that this is a bit of an exaggeration, but this definitely comes into play even when a company fully denominates expenses and revenues in BTC. The BTC price of ASICMiner shares is very much affected by the purchasing power of Bitcoin.

The QT client does not affect the speed of confirmations; mining does. If the miners are unlucky at any given time, it may take longer than ten minutes to get one confirmation.

I don't see how ASICMiner could be completely independent from the USD value of BTC even if everything is denominated in BTC. If the USD-value of BTC were to double, and the price of the mining hardware (in BTC) did not change, sales could drop. If the price of the hardware did drop, that's fewer Bitcoins going out to share holders.

From my preliminary research here is what I see has happened:
When you add a "Buy with Bitcoin" button from Coinbase to your website (as a merchant), it allows the user to click the button to open a Coinbase page/popup to allow you to pay for an item, donate, etc. This button already displays your name, email, and address. When the googlebot comes crawling around your site, it finds the button, follows the link, and indexes the transaction page.
It does not appear that transactions themselves (an individual purchase) are indexed, nor do I see anyway that would be possible without a major mix-up on Coinbase's side. **The only thing that google has cached is essentially a list of "Buy With Bitcoin" buttons.**

Just because a commonly accepted transaction fee right now be 0.001 BTC/kB (I haven't actually paid much attention to the current accepted fees lately), doesn't mean that the same fee would be required for when a latte would cost 0.0005 (roughly 1BTC = 6000USD).

It probably doesn't matter for the small amount you're dealing with now, but posting one address and having customers tell you the transaction number is generally a bad idea. It's incredibly easy for a malicious person to constantly poll that address and submit an order for themselves when they see a transaction went through. It can even be scripted and automated so that they will almost always be faster than the one who actually sent the BTC.
The accepted way of avoid this issue is to pre-generate a bunch of new BTC address, and give each customer their own unique address to send coins to. This way, you _know_ that the customer paid, and it's not someone else who is pretending to have paid.
I don't know if you can display a unique message to each person that fills out the Google Form or not, but that would be the best way to go about it:
1) Have them fill out the form
2) Display a unique address to the customer
3) Wait for coins to show up at the address
If you can't do step (2) with Google Forms you can alternatively do this:
1) Have them fill out the form
2) Email the customer their unique address
3) Wait for coins to show up at the address
Hope this helps, and good luck with the endeavor! I might buy a card, since they are so neat!

That is true, but as the purchasing power of Bitcoin goes up, there is more and more benefit to building, buying, and using mining hardware. More and more hardware companies enter the game, and ASICMiner loses market share.
A miner's market share (percentage of the total network hashing power) directly corresponds to the number of _BTC_ per time that the miner earns. So if market share remains constant, the earnings in terms of BTC will remain the same. My argument, however, is that if the value of BTC goes up, most likely ASICminer's market share will go down, and thus the _number_ of BTC earned will decrease. They may still earn the same _purchasing power_ worth of Bitcoin, but at some point it could have been more profitable to just hold on to BTC itself.

Except that if the value of BTC goes up, the value of the share (in terms of BTC) can very likely go down.
Think about it this way: if you were to buy a share for 1BTC (when 1BTC = 100USD), and the value of BTC skyrockets to 1BTC = 1,000BTC, your share is probably not going to be worth 1BTC anymore, because no one would pay 1,000USD worth of BTC for the share. 
Now, if no else started mining when BTC skyrocketed (ie, ASICMiner is still giving out 0.011BTC dividends), then yes, the share could still be worth 1BTC. But that is unlikely, and just another factor to consider when determining whether or not this would be more profitable than holding Bitcoin.

Probably because the original iPhone and the iPhone 3G aren't really in use anymore. Does the version of Android that can be installed via openiboot even support the Gyft app?

Your brother is lying to you.
Edit: Unless you are talking about 0.50USD per week.

Off by a few orders of magnitude. It's actually .025%!

That line of thought comes up time and time again. There are very, very few reasons to mine at a loss. If you think that the value of Bitcoin is going to go up, just buy Bitcoin outright. Mining at a loss is a loss no matter which way you look at it.

At least on the BCT TC ASICMiner PT shares from burnside, you can request that burnside convert your PT shares to real friedcat shares at no cost.

Once again, please stop posting this. We get it, you don't need to post over and over again. It is unprofessional and probably has the opposite effect than you want.

That used to be the case, but currently, mining litecoin earns you a little less than you would get mining Bitcoin, especially since scrypt mining uses a little more electricity.

This is not a good idea. Are you talking about using a Raspberry Pi with some sort of ASIC attached, or just mining off the CPU/GPU of the Pi? If we're talking the latter, you will never, ever see anything close to a positive ROI at all.
If you mine on the Pi alone, and even you get 100 of them for free, you will mine $3 worth of Bitcoin per YEAR, even if the difficulty doesn't change at all. If you pay for electricity, you will pay at least $280 per year in power costs, for a net loss of $277 per year.
You are much much much better off buying an ASICMiner Block Eruptor and hooking that up to your Pi, than buying any number of extra Pi's. And even then, many will argue that it won't provide any ROI either.

This is true, but even with more and more users using Linux-base machines, writing a malicious exploit and payload for a Windows box is much more common and profitable, even if the same vulnerability is available on other platforms. More importantly, a vulnerability found in something like Flash on Windows is not necessarily present (or useful) on a Linux box. Why hunt for Linux vulnerabilities when you can potentially hit 85x more users with a Windows 'sploit?

And now you can squash this guy hopefully!

Does your first point apply if you have two-factor authentication enabled? It was my understanding that to retrieve the encrypted wallet (for brute-force/dictionary cracking), the two-factor code needed to be correct first.
(I may be wrong here, just asking for clarification.)

I've though about switching to squeeze a few more MH/s out of the rig, but it's just so gosh-darned convenient to be able to switch mining off of one of the cards when I need to do something else GFX-intensive on the machine! :D

Well put. I was a few minutes too late with mine &gt;.&lt;
