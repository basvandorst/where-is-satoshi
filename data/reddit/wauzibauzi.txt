hold your phone near a (passive) NFC tag containig a "bitcoin:" URI and it will open Mycelium.
In future it will also work when you perform a "Android Beam" (holding 2 NFC-enabled phones back to back) from the startpage of the "Bitcoin Wallet" by Andreas Schildbach to your phone. 
(This will only work with the next version of Schildbach's "Bitcoin Wallet" as the current version only tries to open the Schildbach wallet, when doing a "Android Beam". Andreas Schildbach relaxed this requirement to be more interoperable with other Bitcoin wallets).

Now you can also import keys (and adresses) from backups created with the "Bitcoin Wallet" app by Andreas Schildbach.
This allows real easy migration from Schildbach wallet to Mycelium. (You can even continue to use both wallets and manage the same addresses in both apps.).

This $33 printer does not support to print images directly from USB thumbdrives. (Mycelium Entropy emulates a thumbdrive)
Just because it uses an USB port to connect to a computer this doesn't automatically mean that it also can print images directly from USB devices without a computer.

**TL;DR:** You probably should not use any Bitcoin wallet and Xposed on the same device.
Don't underestimate the power of Xposed! Having a working Xposed installation on your system means that some developer could easily trick you into installing (and activating) a Xposed module which does something useful, but also does some other harmful stuff (which you will not be able to prevent or even notice).
Unlike rooting where SuperSU (or other SU apps) warn you each time an app tries to get root privileges you don't have any idea what methods or which apps a Xposed module tries to intercept.
But: You still have to manually enable the Xposed module before it can do any harm.
Could you provide a list of all your installed Xposed modules (including version) and the sources where you got them from (from within the Xposed installer app, external downloads, Github, etc).
I haven't seen any Bitcoin stealing Xposed malware in the wild myself until now, but it always seemed to me like a pretty scary easy way to steal someone's private keys/seeds.
