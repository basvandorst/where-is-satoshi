I concur. They've certainly done it before.

Bitcoin is new, and if you are appointing yourself the director of marketing, my advice to you would be to find a better slogan than "If you don't like it, don't use it."

What is key is that development of a cryptographic protocol whose purpose is to keep track of money changing hands has been split into pro-Gavin or anti-Gavin groups rather than being handled by a mature engineering standards committee as one would normally expect with this sort of thing.  It's hard to take bitcoin's long term viability seriously at this point.

Please tell that to the fellow that I replied to.  As an outsider, or a Newegg executive, or the author of a Forbes article looking at bitcoin and discovering a squabble/cowboy approach to its infrastructure development, a reasonable reaction would be to shake one's head in disbelief.
Controversy and arguing about which approach should be made *as quickly as possible* and then Just Doing It is what anyone who is used to the past several decades of protocol development on the Internet, of RFCs and steering committees and white papers and conferences and mailing lists, would call dangerous and irresponsible, especially with regards to cryptographic protocols. Please correct me if I am wrong, but a contentious hard fork is exactly what has just happened.

The front page of the site tries to connect to taboola.com, cloudfront.net, persona.org, facebook.com, google-analytics.com, and googleusercontent.com.
Sorry, but a site that is supposed to be "super private" that begins by asking my browser to send my IP address to all of the above before I've done anything doesn't even pass the laugh test.

Why don't you interpret it and describe it for me?  Compare bitcoin's planning, development, and implementation methodology with that of the planning, development, and implementation methodologies of SSL and IMAP and others that anyone who has watched the Internet grow up are familiar with.
If you are a proponent of bitcoin, then ignore my point at your peril.  Allowing politics and controversy to overshadow technological discussion puts the whole thing at risk, and is no way to encourage adoption of a standard.

Couldn't you buy hitmen in Silk Road?  Didn't Ulbricht himself try to hire a couple?  Is this story just full of shit?  
Edit: Alrighty, I see that the prosecution dropped all of the charges related to alleged hitmen and the alleged emails talking about hitmen.

I don't think you are correct.  He was found guilty on all seven counts brought against him, but none of them were for the two hits claimed in the original court documents. There were three drug charges, one charge of running a criminal organization, one of hacking, one of distributing false ID, and one of money laundering.  He wasn't charged with anything related to hitmen.  Do you know something I don't?

Looking forward to seeing something solid about this, because there is nothing that can shake my confidence in *a monetary system that is based on cryptography* like poorly documented efforts by various entities to make changes to it.  I'm staying far away from bitcoin until this whole issue has settled out and stabilized, and I'll bet I'm not the only one.

What does this mean right now for retailers accepting payments? Should they stop taking payments for awhile and hold off until things settle out?

In 30 years of RFCs and Internet protocols, I have never seen anything like this. If squabbling followed by the cowboy approach is the norm for changes to a cryptographic protocol the purpose of which is to move money around, I believe that bitcoin's demise is a certainty. My confidence, and I fear the confidence of many others who look into this, in the ability of this particular system of digital currency to survive competition over the long term has been reduced to near zero. It did cross my mind that perhaps you guys are aware of that, and that that was the whole idea.
