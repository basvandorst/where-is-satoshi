We never "knew" we were discussing prices around 6k in 10 years (let alone 10k+ now), most BTC holders from the beginning where only dreaming of 1k.... BTC has done a lot in 10 years.

Never say never, it was made to counter fiat. 
  
If you look at Venezuela that does not get their gold back from the UK which is really vague and not right, i think bitcoin will be a more "safer" place to store value than gold. If you own your own keys you own your own BTC.
sidenote: i don't like socialism etc or that leader from that country - it's just really alarming if a country does not get back what is originally from them because they store it for example there.
What if they do this on civilians in the future?

I think you are right about that gold has value and usage across the board, but i think it is a good alternative in the future.
America has fort Knox to keep it's gold save with military powers around it - a country like Venezuela does not have that and it takes decades to come on an technological level as that of the american army, you can say the same about the Russian army or even China which is an rising competitor of the US.
Countries that are dependent on those what i just listed can easily be backstabbed and their assets are seized overseas without intervention. (A blockchain based asset is then a lot harder to seize) 
Next to that people think that the value are in the coins in BTC but is the network/PoW that makes it so valuable, the concept of an valuable network is harder to comprehend for the majority of the people/population since they are almost all "technological illiterate" if i phrase it right. It all needs to be simple or else it won't be used, they dont care if their privacy is being violated (look at google, Microsoft) as long as it works and is easy.
Next to that i think the future money is not in physical assets but in digital assets because we are getting more dependent on tech.  
Lets say bitcoin network can do in the future the same as ETH - ETH has a single point of failure and that is vitalik in my opinion (im no bitcoin maximalist and i got ETH)
If BTC could do the same as eth then you can run any app on the BTC network and receive the safety of the network to say it this simple, i think that is insane.  
Ofcourse there will always be some sort of FIAT for a long time but if you look at what BTC has achieved in the past 10 years i think this is just the beginning.

Exactly, politics look like a tribal war zone these days.

Or dont have MFa active, leave your assets on a site (not your keys not your coins) then wonder how they lose everything.

are these pathetic posts coming again after a minor increase?

Meanwhile the left completely destroyed the words "facists' racist" "nazi" etc.
Everybody is now one that does not agree with them, they all got called facist, nazi or racist.
The word has lost its power - and when REAL facists racists or nazi's show up nobody will notice.
