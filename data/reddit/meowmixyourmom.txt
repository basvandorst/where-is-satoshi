which means people need to track 100% of all transactions for goods or services and file taxes on them. That's why it's annoying to transact in bitcoin.

As long as computer has no key logger or malware. I think some people use virtual machines (IIRC TAILS) to do it safely.

If held over a year is it then only 15%?

When you "say chose segwit " what does that mean? 
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:45:24
What about exchange of coins for goods or services? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:24:22
If we want to hold, is there anything that we have to do to keep both be cash and Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:55:07
Thank you.

IIRC - So when a block is built/mined your node confirms the new block and then adds it to the block chainhistory. The more nodes there are the less likely somebody is able to create attacks on the blockchain because of the additional independent full nodes which verify the transaction history.

You just help support the chain which is a good thing. if you don't have data limits and you can manage it, the community really appreciates it.

Because if everybody thinks the way you do then pretty soon there won't be thousands, there might be hundreds... and then pretty soon there might be tens... and then maybe it's easier to perform attack on bitcoin Network because there's only 10 computers running it versus 100,000 computers running it

@_date: 2017-11-08 23:29:26

@_date: 2017-11-08 23:34:33
Lol. Bitcoin the wild ride.

Can you explain why smallholder would be "squashed" by this transaction?  
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:56:00
...and a lot of small holders bought and have held since it was 300,400,500,600,etc. The hysteria is amusing. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:38:41
So you meant small Trader not small hodlr? Because the word holding means you don't trade
