A valid question clearly no one is keen/able to answer! Will watch.

This feels so much like a bubble. 99% of bitcoins will be traded back to USD to make purchases. Why pay so much for a currency that you can't use to buy anything?

Can someone define what a bitcoin actually is? So for example, I have 1 btc, why does this have value?

That's my concern, a whole heap of environmental factors could compromise my cold paper passphrase.

Thanks for tip. I will check it out but I just moved most of my passwords to lastpass and   I love the 2fa. Makes me feel very secure haha

Can you elaborate "transaction fee depletes the supply"?

I lost it there.

Or send it to a paper wallet &lt;- why don't people recommend this simple, easy, cheap method? Am I wrong about something here?

I also do this yet everyone tells me "get a trezor". Then they are unable to give me a good reason why I would need one. 
I don't see the point if you just want to put coins somewhere and hold. 
I use jaxx for having a small amount handy in case I want to buy something (if I ever find a retailer that takes bitcoin haha!)

In Coinbase there is an option to send coins. Just enter your breadwallet address and hit send. DO NOT LOOSE YOUR PRlVATE KEY!

Great q I want to know also!

But then I have to store that iron plate somewhere safe. What if someone finds it? What if there is a fire? Earthquake? If I make 2 and store in separate locations, risk of someone else finding it increases. 
I'm torn between finding the best balance.

I do it differently. Download breadwallet on iOS device. Go offline. Create wallet. Copy address to notepad. Write down recovery key. Delete breadwallet. Go back online. 
Feels quite safe, whilst I agree it's not a true cold wallet, I think this is as safe as anyone would need, no?

Yes, move to jaxx or paper wallet.
