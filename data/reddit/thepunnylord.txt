I open like 50 tabs when researching a coin and it takes a couple of hours at the very least. Need a PC for it.

Look at the weekly charts.

Check the sell rates. If the sell rates are higher too, the higher buy rate won't really matter.

Try coindelta!

Don't transfer it from the exchange to another wallet or another exchange. 
If your intention is to buy alt coins with that BTC, I'd suggest you buy ETH from coinbase instead. ETH or LTC is significantly cheaper to transfer at the moment.

If bitcoin wasn't trading with the Bitcoin name, it would be worth 1USD.

Literally every single time BTC made a bull run for 3-6 weeks, there have been 2 weeks of drops and the price would surge after that. Literally every single time. Meaning, HODL guys!

Not really. Buy BTC, transfer it to an exchange, convert it to alts... But when calculating your profits, first calculate your profits in BTC terms, and then convert that into fiat using the higher sell rates. Or you can just use Delta app instead. 
Since both the buy and sell rates are higher,.as long as the BTC value of your holdings increase, and BTC doesn't fall, you'll make a profit.

You can... But I'd suggest you don't move it. Transaction costs are around 50USD at the moment.
