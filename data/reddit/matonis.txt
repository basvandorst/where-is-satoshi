FYI, this same Reddit discussion is continuing in this multi-page thread 
@_date: 2012-02-19 18:41:51
I enjoyed reading your reply. Think of it this way - Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good money) only applies in an environment of State-sanctioned money where exchange rate is set by law. Otherwise, without the State sanction and legal tender privilege, good money would drive out the bad money and we would keep the high-silver-content coinage in circulation instead of hoarding it to be melted down. That means that Gresham's Law has a precondition for which it applies.
Similarly, the Mises Regression Theorem has a precondition in order to be valid which is that the State must NOT have the capability to restrict or deny any forms of competing currencies and the State must NOT have the capability to confiscate a commodity-backed currency that commences in accordance with Regression Theorem.
If those two preconditions are not present then the Regression Theorem cannot apply. This is very important to modern monetary economics and to Austrian economics because Menger, Bohm-Bawerk, Mises, Hayek, and the rest of the gang could not have contemplated the digital embodiment of currency and the modern States' capability to seize domain names and restrict centralized versions of digital cash.
The decentralised and impervious bitcoin possesses a characteristic that was not necessary in pre-1990 analog monetary matters, namely the ability (resilience) to function online despite massive legal and technical attacks. I call that the "The Binary Corollary".

Thanks. It was definitely worth posting but he didn't really add anything new to the overall discussion. He starts by saying that bitcoin's promise is rattled by the price plunge and lack of sustained advancement, but that really just reveals that he doesn't grasp the cryptographic significance of a cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Silver plunged from $50/oz to $4/oz and silver is still considered viable.
Unfortunately, Murphy is too much like the other mainstream Austrians that won't believe it until it happens. They won't risk their reputation on crypto-economics because they don't get RPOW and block chains and the Byzantine General's problem.

Sure. Bitcoin is not recognized as money in any jurisdiction; hence it is not addressed in anti-money laundering laws because there is no money. That may change but I doubt that the monetary authorities will ever recognize bitcoin as a currency (for reasons that I state in my paper '[Air Guitars and Bitcoin Regulation](
It's like being paid in beanie babies or toothpaste. None of those instruments would involve anti-money laundering legislation. As long as bitcoin is the payment sent and bitcoin is the payment received then I don't see how banks are involved. Please note that I am not addressing any conversion issues either in or out of bitcoin because that is optional.

Good informative interview. I like how Charlie explained their process of 'special arrangements' and load balancing via analysis of market conditions. For the most part, their growth is capped by their reserve base (or short-term credit lines) and that reserve base becomes more dispersed as additional exchanges/endpoints are added. Also, the per transaction limits decrease BitInstant's effectiveness for arbitrage trading, but I understand why they must have them.

Disagree. Corrupt bankers are expensive and they do not always have a tendency towards loyalty. In practicing *safe* bitcoining, money laundering laws become irrelevant because there is nothing to launder and there is nothing in the banking system. AML laws are not violated.
The largest problem at the moment is that the necessary transaction sizes in the international drug trade far exceed the current market cap of bitcoin so it is not yet practical.

Zhou Tong of Bitcoinica has responded to this in the Forum:
- Bitcoinica is no longer a product of xWaylab Inc., and we no longer operate in the jurisdiction of Delaware. We have registered a new entity outside of United States and we are now a fully licensed financial services provider in that country. (We will announce our new corporate structure with proof of financial services license available from a government site.)
- Bitcoinica is a Bitcoin CFD (Contract For Difference) trading platform, not a bucket shop. Even though our trading facilities don't deliver actual Bitcoins, there is actual trading of Bitcoins among Bitcoinica customers or at other exchanges. The benefit of trading CFDs instead of Bitcoins is the possibility of margin trading of commodity-like assets, instead of contract-like assets. The underlying trading process is absolutely legal.
- We have a legal deadline for doing KYC procedures, and currently we are still far from that. However, we are considering requiring identification documents from our customers. We will launch a poll to hear your voices.

It's common knowledge that bitcoin is both a payments system and a unit of account.

Interesting reply with some good points.
However, the risk is not in the actual debit pull. The risk is in the database of customer accounts and credentials; there could be any number of scenarios where ACH transactions occur that would justify a reversal with or without two-factor authentication. The burden of proof is not on the customer and they would have plausible deniability related to any claim of a hack. I suspect this is why Coinbase has a $100 limit.
When a reversal is initiated upon Coinbase, it is reversed against subsequent deposits so it need not match the original customer funds. In fact, the original customer funds can be already on the move in bitcoin. Of course, this scenario could not be repeated very often, so the real question is what's the appropriate limit? Not really worth it for $100, but without higher limits Coinbase is a partially-crippled service with limited applicability.
@_date: 2012-04-22 14:42:05
I don't think so. The maximum amounts are too small and part of BitInstant's new MSB registration is that they have to develop internal policies and procedures to recognize the batching of multiple small amounts that would aggregate into larger amounts for the same customer benefit.
Furthermore, BitInstant enforces per transaction and per day limits so the suitcase of cash isn't going away anytime soon.

Robert should have waited until he completed his bitcoin article. Here's an article from another Austrian economist that might help him out: 
I like Murphy, but he didn't go far enough like proposing a Corollary to the Theorem:
[EDIT] A Binary Corollary to Mises' Regression Theorem - The regression theorem is not forward-looking and in the binary digital world of the 21st century a theorem corollary is needed to account for arbitrary enforcement and confiscation against a competing nonpolitical monetary system. This binary corollary weighs the importance of a modern money's survivability and states that a digital money is exempt from the regression theorem specifically if: (a) the network can be demonstrated to be immune from State enforcement and termination; and (b) the monetary unit can be defensible against State confiscation.
Due to its p2p decentralised structure, bitcoin satisfies both of the above conditions of the corollary. A permanent disruption of bitcoin's p2p distributed global network would require a practical shutdown of the Internet itself, something the authorities would be reluctant to do since it would simultaneously devastate the broader economy. Furthermore, the monetary unit itself is defensible against State confiscation because it is protected by strong cryptography and the units exist only on the distributed nodes of the network. Actually, bitcoin units are never really transferred but the block chain records the necessary adjustments to ownership. This is related to the tangible intrinsic value discussion because decentralisation has actually achieved defensibility against State confiscation since any other non-digital type of intrinsic value would be subject to confiscation via its centralised location.

Great question! Brainwallets (deterministic private/public key pairs) would only exist in your head so they would have no physical existence. Before any claim of physical property rights can be exerted by you or against you, the item's existence would have to be provable first. Your property rights can be used to exert control of your ownership or in some cases to deny any ownership, such as to bypass capital controls or taxes.
With bitcoin, you decide the level of property provability or non-provability. The closest legal area to follow for this specific issue is the area of Key Disclosure Law, which varies widely by jurisdiction (thankfully). See

I think the end result could be a better understanding for me, but also a better understanding for the Bitcoin community on how to live in harmony with democratic authority."

A government may embrace bitcoin to garner the $10 trillion+ vibrant shadow economy and give the finger to OECD/FATF. They could do this by supporting 1-to-1 bitcoin convertibility with their national currency. See

You are right to direct your anger towards SR instead of the State, but I think you are missing the point of what SR is saying. The decision of what free humans can and cannot purchase should be left up to the market.

Yes, but with a $50 million global market cap now, bitcoin still has a huge influx of outside capital to accommodate. So for the medium-term, the increase in bitcoin's market price will be driven more by outside money coming in than by the effectiveness of bitcoin as a circulating medium organically.

Saying that it's a fact of life makes the case that it is an actual choice for bitcoin to be a 'regulated' alternative market currency. The die is cast -- it is what it is. I don't think it's possible to have a 'regulated' bitcoin currency unless the protocol is forked or FinCEN starts building a new block chain. 
The current regulatory strife is not directed at bitcoin, but where it intersects national currencies and national currency account-holding. National money is not the only way to obtain bitcoin -- one could reasonably obtain bitcoin for diamonds or labour. In bitcoin-only trade situations, no FSP or MSB guidelines even enter into the picture.

Yes, he was referring to Google Bucks. Now if they were to work like Facebook Credits where they only go "into" the system, then they would not be very useful for p2p payments. FB Credits are like a virtual currency roach motel -- your money checks in but it doesn't check out. The two-way convertibility is what changes it from a closed-loop system to an open-loop system with a significantly different set of regulatory requirements.

Yes, but at that point, it's not about the printing. It's about gaining global trade volume in your currency, leveraging that into reserve currency status. Today for trade volume, it's roughly 46% in USD and 43% in Euro. Major opportunity.

Adrianne has been good about reporting on bitcoin strictly as a journalist so I give her points for that. I give her points also for being the first woman AFAIK that voluntarily discusses bitcoin.

Bitcoin is like one of those stealth systems that sits in the background germinating. It's not going away except in some misguided articles that you might read. It will be there long after fraudulent central banks and definitely after MintChip so it doesn't hurt to reserve your spot on the block chain early.

Personally, I feel that the key points to make on a financial program like The Keiser Report are the larger economic issues, such as potential for global tax-free exchange due to user-defined financial privacy, implications for nation-State tax policy and monetary policy, the irrelevancy of international capital controls, the irrelevancy of political borders, the de-politicization of currency, and the end of an era for using money to track identity.
That should be enough material for an interesting 15-minute segment. It is not a crypto show.

Sure. If the IMF's SDRs (Special Drawing Rights) are held as a reserve currency, then there is no reason that bitcoin cannot be utilized in that fashion. The ridiculous SDRs are an imaginary basket of IOU nothings. The first country that does this will have a huge economic advantage with respect to garnering the total available market potential for bitcoin transactions, attracting exchanges, etc.

Currency is no more associated with criminals than phones and the mail. We have been brainwashed as subjects to believe that it is appropriate to use money as a way to track identity. This is wrong. Bitcoin provides the potential for user-defined privacy. The reporting of income for purposes of taxation and the disclosing of transaction details for purposes of sales tax is up to the individual. The modern system of taxation rests upon the voluntary compliance of the subjects.

It's good to see TradeHill mentioned in this CNBC article. They actually became the leading exchange by volume when MtGox was down due to the recent security breach. Also, TradeHill accepts EUR transfers so the BTC/EUR currency pair may eclipse the BTC/USD currency pair.

What bitcoin skeptics are really saying when they mention limited privacy over anonymity is that they don't think a digital currency should have the same attributes as physical cash today (namely irreversibility and anonymity). In short, they are promoting a 'cashless society'....and not the good kind.

I even quoted his paper in my article; 
I mainly base my observations on Grinberg's audio ( at the 39:00 min mark) where he appreciates the tracking aspects of bitcoin for law enforcement more than he appreciates the potential for individual financial privacy. That's all. It can go either way -- everyone has leanings.
Here's another one of his papers that appears to do the same thing:  
(Overall,I agree that it's hard to read Grinberg because he's being an objective lawyer here, but I heard/read enough to know that he attempts to confine bitcoin to existing security law constructs which I fundamentally disagree with. Also, his fear of and respect for the legitimacy of anti-money laundering laws would make him a poor choice for a defense attorney in a financial privacy case.)
I can't tell if he supports monetary freedom or not. He does not come out and say that government's monopoly on money is a bad thing.

The conversion rate now would imply $500,000 however at the time of the daily and monthly earnings the exchange rate was lower, meaning that the $500k number is equally from BTC price appreciation as much as it is from gambling earnings.

The free market decides the BTC market price and the free market will decide transaction fees (based on desired transaction times). A state of no block size limits avoids the market mechanism for pricing transaction times. It would be similar to letting the market decide the 21 million limit.

Correct. Fund holds 80,000 BTC acquired at various intervals over the last 6-9 months. $3.2m is an estimated current valuation based on $40/BTC. They actually state that it is a currency-only focused fund that's why no performance-based fee.

Bitcoin is currently legal in every jurisdiction in the world. As “play money,” its usage in online poker and gaming is akin to Zynga Poker. Regulators are in a quandary because to recognize bitcoin ironically would lead to increased legitimacy for what is now not even a recognized currency.
