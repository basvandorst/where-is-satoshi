A lot of people think caucasian = white people. Caucasion is pretty much anyone who's not of african or asian decent. So, in essence, he's saying white people.

Someone else can also filibuster the next day when they try to vote. It's all about coordination. There have been filibusters where the ones being filibustered brought beds so they could sleep until the speaker gave up. It doesn't always work, but it's a deterrent in some cases.

Well, at the risk of sounding facetious, I think it's safe to assume that software developers are on the higher end of the wage scale, and that most people, probably less than your average person, have been to college and work as a software developer. So, it is kind of a unique situation, which is why I asked.

I'm not sure what white collar jobs you're talking about, but I'm just sitting here working my "white collar job" making $15/hour and am extremely happy that I'm not making minimum wage.
However, considering he's talking about making this money playing blackjack online and manipulating the system, I'd say he made a pretty good haul either way.

Living in the city also comes with a higher cost of living. I'm just curious, do you bring up software developers because of something wesblog put in his comment?

Dogecoin started off as a joke on 4chan, but it is a real cryptocurrency now, and even with all the nay-sayers below, considering it has only been around for about one month, it has done extremely well and has a large community backing it.
