so your saying that because LN in its basically 1st alpha release week loses 1 of the first handful of nodes to get setup pre beta, then thats evidence that its going to be very centralized?  Hrm makes perfect sense.
Needing to have your node online 24/7 to protect their funds doesn't sound right. I'll need a bit more info to believe that is the case.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:18:03
maybe its possible you don't know how the internet "looks"?
You have the T1 carriers, level 3, att, etc..which are all connected with fat pipes. then you have the T2 carriers, who buy from them to sell to the end users.  These will be the major carriers and online wallets. the t2 carriers have the medium pipes. These will be the businesses that accept lightning.  then you have the end users who have just what ever they need.  I think its highly likely to be a similar type of setup here.

Its great for sending large transactions right now. sent $15k for like $6 yesterday.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:17:32
Is there any way to know what percentage of all transactions are going to/from exchanges?  I bet its over 50%.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:17:19
thanks for the clarification.  Thats super helpful.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:06:46
I remember back in the day, people were making software to upload data to the block chain since the space was so cheap.  They should do that for bcash since they don't have issues with block space and will just keep upgrading the block size.  Lets all use it for storing our data.

using urandom might not be secure and could possibly generate predictable keys...  I would be careful doing that.

The answer is always yes.... "if your willing to hold for at least 2 years"
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:00:41
it seems like the same problem as bgp solves.  you announce your routes to the global routing table. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:14:11


It really seems like it.  Plus we already know that 20% of the fees are from coinbase and their non batching non segwit shit.  really feels like artificial fee inflation to me.  i think that since bcash didn't go up as fast as roger thought, it doesn't make sense to continue burning cash to inflate bcash any more.  he was trying to get everyone over there and it just isn't going to happen.  I would like to see what would happen if someone started writing massive amounts of data to bcash since they will just keep raising the block size and see how long they can keep getting them to raise the block size for basically no expense.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:59:11
I would just smile and nod.  maybe a few eye rolls for good measure.

yea.  circumstances different in that people will keep their nodes online longer than on test net. seems to be even more favorable to the web topology that we are starting to see here. don't you think?
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:42:04
I will argue that.    with transaction batching becoming more common, simply looking at transactions is misleading.  if big exchanges all start doing batching and each transaction now has 100's of outputs then the volume of transactions is going down simply because we are being more efficient.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:16:20
so roger ver said hes fucking up the company.  Was that before or after he made the video saying they are all good and its just the banks fault?
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:55:46

i don't think test net will grow that large.  really no point to run it all the time since it uses processor power. people will run it for a few days and then shut it down after they get a taste on test net.  at least thats what I did.

no you.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:51:40
that picture looks like a spiderweb.  sure a few highly connected nodes but not as bad as the post last week which showed like 3 nodes that controlled all the traffic.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:55:05
doubt test net will ever get that big. but maybe.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:03:54
maybe... but I dont really know much about it.  someone just bought 100M in xrp.  Only people crazy enough to  do that are the banks that are pumping in in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:21:47
that 144 blocks is like 1 day of blocks is that correct?
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:17:11
i saw a talk the other day
"if some alt coin claims to be faster and better then bitcoin, its because they don't have nearly the same transaction scale problem that bitcoin has.  No one has solved the fundamental scaling problem yet"
That being said, lightning network + channel factories is going to be able to scale to 100's of millions of users.  We will get there, sure its not that great for the small users now but in the end, the more efficient chain should win.  just look at gas engines.  Sure getting 12 miles to the gallon was great when gas was cheap, but now we have electric cars which are better then any gas engine and are cheaper to operate too.  it just took lots of engineering and research to advance the technology.  No one was happy back in the 80's when the government announed higher fuel efficiency standards, but look what we got out of it.  bitcoin is the same spot right now.  just be patient.

Heres how I did it..but of course do this at your own risk.
1) 
2) at the bottom there is a "use secret key" link. I pasted it in there
3) boom access.. you can also type username/password if you remember it.
4) xfer all the ripple out into some other place. I went to kracken since I alredy had an account
5) sell that shit (or don't)
6) profit
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:36:41
as long as your in for the long term you should be fine.

can someone get it to work on bcash?  I don't think it would be too bad of we stress test their network for them?  People have been doing it to bitcoin for years.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:46:25
its already working on test net.  Seems like its going to be basically ready next month.??
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:42:35

@_date: 2017-12-31 19:11:44
Did you know that XRP:
1) of the 100B premined, 38B are in circulation, the rest being owned by the premine.  The premine kept 68% of the coin for them selves
2) Ripple Labs can freeze XRP accounts using two possible methods: one can stop the functionality of an individual account while the “global freeze” can bring the entire network to a halt.
3) The ripple ledger is not decentralized at all and is centrally controlled by banks.
I just cant get behind a premined shit coin where your account can be frozen at a whim.  Sorry.

lightning network cant come fast enough.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:37:06
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:20:28
Sure the two technologies have different use cases.  Ripple can be frozen / seized at any time. Bitcoin cant.  Ripple is a centralized ledger... might as well be using MySQL at that point.  Bitcoin is decentralized.    I'm sure that's why banks love it.  But I'm not in it to become a millionaire and pure profit has never been my motive. 
Maybe that wasn't the best decision from a purely financial standpoint, I guess time will tell.  But I put my money in what I believe in. 
@_date: 2019-07-20 04:49:38
what do you make of this?

1) 20%+ of the worlds population is 14 years or under, and the vast majority of them wouldn't need it. Down to 12080 days.
2) Average transaction size is 234 bites not 900.  Down to 3140 days
3) other optimizations coming down the pipe lets just give it 20% more.  Down to 2512 days.
Conclusion: even if 10% of the worlds population adopted bitcoin and opened a channel every year, we would be fine.

I had this same dilemma last year.  I made the choice to buy the miner.  Yes, I did make some money but I would have made 10x more had I simply just bought the bitcoins directly.  At no point in history has mining ever been more profitable then just simply buying bitcoins directly.  Bitcoins are the output of the mining machine.  Guaranteed, you would make more just by simply buying the coins and holding them.  
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:51:38
Main reason you shouldn't is because its too easy to lose.  There is no good way to store bitcoin currently, and no way to insure it.  you lose those keys / get hacked / don't have the keys on a titanium disc in a fire proof safe and there is a good chance of losing them.

Hey guys, just wanted to point out.  I searched for the word "bike" because I wanted to buy one.  You don't see an actual bike until you get to the 4th page.  Its showing razor scooters, umbrella's and toothpaste, but no bikes....
Might need a bit of tweaking on the search algo.

I agree with all of this except your first point.  I have never had a significant delay that mattered.  Of course I have been buying all my stuff online where it doesn't matter as much.

from my perspective, it seems about the same (actually way faster) to create a bank account.  I put a deposit in my eclair wallet.  That deposit needs to clear (its fine by the next day with a low priority fee) from there, I can instantly buy things through LN.  So basically you get all the convenience of a bank without having to use a bank.
For example I just wanted to buy a shirt with LN.  I didn't have enough funds in my eclair wallet. Doh.  So I transfered $50 into the wallet before I went to bed.  Next morning woke up with my 6+ conf and was able to spend the money.  
Its just going to take a slight amount of change in behavior vs bitcoin to become convenient for people to use it.  Instead of spending it instantly and then waiting for 6+ conf before the merchant trust you, you pre load it into your spending account and then when you do the actual transaction, its instant.   So the main btc wallet is more like a savings account and the LN wallet is more like a checking account from that perspective.  
Its all really quite logical if you just shift your behavior a little bit.

Since we are making ridiculous predictions with no basis in fact, I predict that you will fall out of a plane and get sucked into the engine of another plane flying by, but that you will survive only to have your parachute not deploy.  You will then hit the ground and bounce back into the plane you jumped out of.

they most likely keep 95% in offline cold storage.  So this theory is implausible at best.
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:50:33
If more people are buying more things, then the same amount of coins must be split up among more users.  This will naturally make the coins more valuable as they are spreading more wealth among the same amount of coin.  
More retailers not holding coins will not make the price drop, but it should make the volatility lower which is still a good thing.  If you always have a steady supply of coins to get and we don't see these huge shortages where no one is willing to sell, that is what causes the price to jump all over the place.  Sometimes being artificially higher then it should be and then due to panic being artificially lower then it should be.  A steady supply of coins on the market will smooth that out so the coins are priced at what the market will bear.

I will say that its fucking impossible for them to be insolvent.  They have been making 500k / day for years.  Lets be honest, the most they could have lost with the transaction bug is a few million.  Annoying to be sure but not going to shut them down by any means.

Things have a way of working out differently then you thought.  Mtgox has 350 coins of mine(about 230k at todays prices).  I'm hella pissed about it, but honestly, you cant put a dollar figure on your life.  I have been ripped off at least 10 times in my life.  Yes I'm a very trusting type of person.  But I just keep getting back on the horse and riding on.  Even with all this, I'm still a successful business man, and generally have everything that I need.  
Point is, you didn't just have 1 chance to get rich even if thats all you care about.  You can still get rich.  Just work hard and keep going.  Negativity and stress only hold you back.  You have to overcome. Your fate is what you make of it.  If you really want to be rich some day, you will be.  If you don't end up rich someday, then you really didn't want it that bad or else you would have found a way to make it happen.  Just try and be happy.  Its a state of mind and its a decision you have to make.

Trust me, I am one of them.  But I think that securing the network should be worth something.  If I cant make a profit to do it, or at least break even, then my contribution would be much smaller then it would be otherwise.  I cant afford to go into debt to secure the network.  You are more of an authority then I, so I would tend to bow to your opinion, but if there is no profit motive, then mine and almost everyones hash rate would be much lower I think.  Do you think the current hash rate is too high currently?

Hey its not their fault that just because they stopped all bitcoin withdrawals right after a major hack and gave absolutely no information about when if ever withdrawals would be re-enabled or that they even had peoples money, that everyone started to panic and sold their holdings at a fraction of the going rate to people who just happened to have money available in the exchange at that exact moment....How could you even suggest such a thing.

people who bought mining equiptment last year and got it in the july-oct timeframe can keep their rigs running till the difficulty hits about 11,000,000,000 before actually losing money every month.  Thats about 5x higher then it is now.  at 25% per difficulty jump that puts it at 8 more adjustments or about march.  Right when the new line of BFL equiptment comes out.  Those poor bastards are going to be lighting up to a 12Billion difficulty where they will be making $600 / month minus power with a huge jump right at that time.... New people trying to get into the game now, probably wouldn't make an ROI on their investment since the margins are getting very tight at the moment.  
Something is going to have to give, either the price is going to have to go up significantly or lots of people are about to get on the get fucked train.  Not sure which yet.

Considering that someone was able to DDos the entire bitcoin network before the core dev team decided to make it a priority, I find this attitude a bit disingenuous.  Mr Karpeles is not the king of bitcoin.  
Some A-Holes noticed they could scam mtgox if they re-transmitted fucked up transactions which basically caused widespread problems with the entire network.  I wouldn't be suprised if said random A-Holes brought up the security issues to the dev team who were ignored and then decided they would make an example of this issue to prove they were right.  
Point is, even if MTGox shares some responsibility for the issue, issuing blame is not the correct way to deal with it.  If anything we should be thanking the attackers for discovering this huge problem with the software.  This will only make bitcoin stronger in the end.
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:58:01

2) They have retained counsel in Japan and are actively working with the japanese court.  
3) They have experience with class action suits.  
All in all, I would rather get 16.5% of something then 50% of nothing.  But yes, this law firm has nothing to do with sunlot.  So when I said I like what they have to say, I meant this law firm, not sunlot.

The goal of espionage and spying is to do harm or have the ability to do harm to the person your spying on.  The person being spied on is not a consenting party and you are affecting some form of violence on them.  You are banning the violence.  


Robbing a bank is using some form of violence against someone to get what you want.  so you are really banning the violence not the act of walking into the bank.
Two consenting adults who wish to trade information in the form of bitcoins are harming no one, and should be protected under 1st amendment.

The risk of course is that the new key they give you back, they know.. So you would then need to re-sweep the key to know that it was not compromised.  Incurring double fees.  Unless you don't mind spreading your private keys all over hell and back.

If you read their official announcements it basically says.
1) we are going to fix this stupid maliability thing but it requires re-indexing the entire blockchain.
2) due to security concerns, our progress is slowed.  
they probably don't follow the forums since no one has anything nice to say about them anyway so they might not even be aware of the level of crazy that is going down at the moment.  I do find this stupid as hell but its the same thing that happened when they shut down for two weeks two years ago due to the hack that "ended" bitcoin and mtgox last time.

Then you go there and find out that whoops your checking account is completely drained.  You still have your savings which was 95% of all the money you had.

Does it matter what reason people had money in Gox? The fact is they did.  Do those people deserve to lose those coins?  No. Of course not.  The situation is more complex than what your making it out to be.  Oversimplification and blaming the victims might make you feel better about your self for having better dumb luck then others, but we need to focus on catching the criminals not blaming the victims.

If the sunlot plan goes through(savegox.com), it looks like 20% will be released immediately and then a 16.5% ownership in the company will be distributed in a pro rata basis which will eventually give dividends to reimburse customers fully.  This could be 16.5% of worthless shit but still.

I was greedy.  I had all my money out.  But I really thought the issues at gox were overstated.  Everyone on IRC was saying they were fine.  So I was buying gox coins via bitcoinbuilder betting against insolvency.  In the end, I might as well have put all my money on 00 at the casino.  I would have had better odds.

This is true, but matthewMwrite is making is sound as if he donated 10's of thousands of dollars and this grand fraud cant continue, when in reality he gave 200 worth of coins at the time.  I think this is really more about the jealousy that is associated with therymos coming out way ahead from his website then it is about getting new forum software.  The forum works... I mean it sort of doesn't really need to be re-designed.  If anything it should retain the same look and feel if the backend code gets re-written. something similar to how 4chan completely re-did their forums html5 style but the look and feel didn't change one bit.

@_date: 2014-02-05 02:59:46
I have disagreed with some of the things you have said before and each time you moderated my posts and deleted them.  All your bitcointalk posts are one sided.  For example, when you donated those 10 coins they were worth what? $200?  But now that they are worth $10k therymos is doing the wrong thing by not having spent them already... When in fact it can be argued by waiting that your contribution to the project is thousands of times larger then you had originally intended.  
The point is, its clearly not as black and white as you make it seem.  
@_date: 2014-05-28 06:40:06

So you send them bitcoin, they sell for dollars and hold your money for you.  Sounds easy enough.  Cant people just do that same thing with coinbase by transferring the coins into cash and then simply depositing into a savings account.  I guess I don't understand the difference here.
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:57:26
You have 5 days to wire transfer them $200,000 at which point you will be eligible to bid.  Better hurry.  Wouldn't it be crazy if no one bid on them and someone got them all for like 10k.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:58:53
Apparently someone had access to their database.  All their entire accounting system is completely fucked up.  They don't know how many coins or dollars they have.  But the accounting system is making it look like 700k coins and 2.8b yen is gone.  This could be wildly inaccurate.    A full forensic accounting is going to be necessary at this point.


Once we discovered that bitcoins had disappeared and the discrepancies between cash funds and deposit balances, we judged that it would be difficult to continue our activities normally and we therefore closed our site at noon on the 25th (Japan time).

Exactly.. however, had karpeles shut gox down when he knew it was over instead of letting this fraud go on, I would not have lost a penny.  By him allowing the trading to continue when he knew he didn't have funds was the direct reason for me losing this money.  I just think its funny that everyone thinks he did nothing wrong.  
But I take responsibility for my actions.  My greed, combined with Karpeles complete lack of morals and/or ethics led to me getting robbed.  I still want justice but I also acknowledge that no one put a gun to my head and made me place the bet on mtgox being solvent.  I did that to my self.  I just wasn't playing with a fair deck.  At least Just-Dice odds are fair.     
@_date: 2014-02-23 10:56:45
Lets say i'm a bank and you have deposited 100 in an account.
Now you withdraw that 100 in the form of magic internet money.
That transaction has a serial number which I assign which after it gets confirmed into the block chain will be in the official record.
Now you being a hacker, spam a duplicate transaction onto the network at the same exact time except your serial number is different since your trying to screw me up.
The money still goes through since its to the same source and destination but my transaction serial number replaced by yours.
I go to read the serial number after I send you the money to confirm you received it, but it doesn't come up since you managed to change it without my knowledge.  This makes me think that my transaction didn't confirm.    I then falsely assume that after some time, the money I tried to send you will come back to me since thats normally how it works when transactions dont confirm.
So I think that I still have the 100 even though i sent it to you.
Now if I'm really stupid, I try and re-send you the money again since I don't want to make you wait.  So now I have sent you $200.  
You could keep doing this over and over since I didn't seem to notice and after a while, I'll notice that i seem to be missing thousands of $$

Ok, so the idea in its simplest term is like this.
Imagine you have a clock with 12 numbers on it.  I tell you to calculate a number, call it x= 38 mod 12.  You would basically count around the clock 1, 2, 3 ... and when you get to 12, you have to start at 1 again.  so if you do this for 38 you will find that it lands on 2.  so 38 mod 12 = 2.  That is easy to figure out right?  Now if I tell you, ok you had X mod 12 = 2, what is x?  Well, x could be anything.  could be 2.  Could be 14, could be 26, could be 38.  They would all result in the same answer of 2.  So you have no way to reverse the function and get the correct answer.  
Now imagine that I could add, subtract, multiply, and divide with these special numbers that allow you to calculate in 1 direction, but cant be undone.  This is a special branch of math which will always result in the same answer (there is no fractions or estimation) so you can be sure that if you do the math, no matter which calculator or computer does it, it can be assured to get to the same answer.  This is the basis for the encryption that is used.  
Now with ECDSA the clock face has 2^256 numbers on it (more then all the atoms in the known universe) and you can start with any starting position, and add multiple results together and do math on them.  
Each operation being easy to calculate but impossible to reverse.  
The "private key" of a bitcoin address is this.  You pick a random number, do these complex one way calculations and arrive at an answer which is basically completely random.  You then give that out as your public key.  
The only way to prove that you have control over that public key is to have the same private key and re-do all the same math that got you there in the first place.  
Since there are more possible private keys then there are atoms in the known universe, in order to recreate that public key, someone would literally have to hit on that same exact starting number that you had, your private key, to arrive at the same public key.  
It would be like saying that you have picked a random atom somewhere in the observable universe, and if you can guess that exact atom, you get to control the funds that it secures.

It sort of depends on how long people hold the coins.  In the scenario where person A inserts a $20 bill into an ATM in california, the money is converted to btc and the the person B in london removed a $20 in euro, that btc was only held in transit.  If everyone were to do that, the btc might never rise in price.  It really depends on how long people are holding.

Bitcoin does somethings that traditional banking can not.  
1) I can sell something to a person in Nigeria with out fear I'm going to be scammed.
2) I can send money to someone in Australia with almost no fees and no delays
3) It does have a fixed supply, and will eventually be a great store of value (just wait until the next block reward half'ing) 
We are just in the akward transition period where the supply is being increased faster then the demand.  If you had been in since the early days, you would have seen that bitcoin death predictions have decreased over time.  I remember a time, when every day people were debating if bitcoin would be around tomorrow.  I no longer have any doubt.  Bitcoin has made it.  Mark my words, as soon as the bitcoin block reward goes in half, people will really start to notice and the price will start to rise.

@_date: 2014-09-23 15:30:56
But you have to look at it in terms of BTC.  Since the point of mining is to earn btc.  You have to calculate the cost of the machine in btc at the time you paid for it vs the equivalent amount of btc that would have been purchased in that timeframe vs the amount of btc that could be mined at the time you receive the miner.  If the machine will not even mine what you put into it, then it was clearly better to just buy btc directly.   Getting a mining rig is nothing more then a more complex way to acquire btc rather then buying them directly.  If you don't get the machine when you expected, then the basis for buying the machine is invalid.

As a single guy, its basically a wash.  By the time I factor my time in to go to the store, buy the food, prepare it, and then throw away the excess that  I didn't eat in time and cleaning, eating at a restaurant actually is about the same or maybe arguably cheaper for me then cooking at home.  So unfortunately your point is invalid. 
However, since we both agree that bitcoin is more convenient than cash or credit cards, I think in order for you to be consistent, you should avoid all restaurants who don't accept bitcoin as well as those who don't accept credit cards.

Overnight I turned 160 coins into 340.  It wasn't even a question that gox was going to cut and run.  I had heard from mtgox employees and people close to the situation that they were fine.  All logic supported this.  Who the fuck could actually lose all their coins slowly over time with out noticing even the cold storage?  it just didn't make any sense.  No one could be that fucking stupid.

As a person who lost almost everything bitcoin to mtgox, I have a much more tempered view then I did before.   Bitcoin has disadvantages that most people simply dismiss as "if you don't hold your keys then you don't own it, bla bla bla"
However, expecting everyone in the world to be able to hold their own keys, not lose them, and never trust any financial institution is just not realistic.  Banks exist for a reason.  Even when money was gold coins, people would put the gold in the bank to have a "safe" place to put it.  Right now, there is apparently no safe place to put coins.  Until this exists, bitcoin will never become mainstream.  Most people can not be trusted to hold their life savings on a piece of paper that if lost, stolen, or damaged will completely make them destitute.  
I'm lucky because I was an early adopter, and all my coins were gotten with little sums of money.  I didn't depend on them for my savings or living so for me it was just a possibility of an early retirement.  A possibility that will no longer exists.  I still have plenty of real world money that I do depend on which will never be moved into the bitcoin system.  My loss while extremely disappointing was not devastating.  
If bitcoin were mainstream, this would not be true for most people and someone losing their life savings by making a simple mistake would be devastating.  This is going to severely hold back the 50k / coin theory that some people have been throwing around.  
Bitcoins greatest innovation is also its greatest weakness.  Its ability to be moved in an instant with no roadblocks or fees.  Irreversibly.  
Until a safety net exists where people cant be ruined by a simple mistake, bitcoin will never become more then a lower cost paypal.  The average Joe would be stupid to hold more then a few hundred in bitcoin at the moment.

This is very debatable and of no consequence.  Even if it were true, its not a good enough reason to ban it.  People who rob banks always wear shoes.  Should we ban shoes as well?  


So your advocating that we should ban people from freely trading digital information with eachother?  At its root, thats what bitcoin is.  Its not as if creating or trading bitcoins harms anyone or anything so there is no logical reason to ban it or think that it wouldn't be a violation of the 1st amendment to even try and ban it.  It affects your 1st amendment right to freedom of speech.  Thats kind of important wouldn't you agree?

It seems like the case of buying the car is not exactly the same thing, let me demonstrate.
Buying a car is for getting around.  So in the case of buying the car, and it shows up 8 months later, you got what you paid for. The useful lifetime of the car was not dimished in any way.  The car will still run for the same number of miles as when you bought it.
When you buy the miner and it shows up later then expected, you got less then what you paid for.  The useful lifetime of the miner was significantly diminished due to the nature of the bitcoin network.  Your capacity is basically getting used regardless of if you had the item in your posession or not.  As time progresses, bitcoins are getting minted at a regular rate, until such time that the coins are all minted.  
Its more equivilant to being back in the old gold rush days, paying for a new mining gear, not getting it for 8 months and by the time you get it, everyone else has already panned all the gold out of the river you were going to work.

well 3 million out of 10 billion is about 0.03% per day if you consider that 100% of that money is available.  However thats not the case.  The real number would be more like   0.08% per day if you remove all the coins that are not in circulation.  That works out to about 2%-3% per month in downward pressure.

I'm sure there are plenty of ways to get mark a big piece of that in some sort of trust where it really cant be traced back to him.

As a business owner who processes $50k - $100k in CC transactions per month, I can confirm that it costs us about $2k - $3k / month in fees.  I guarantee this figure was added into the cost of the goods sold.  
We also take ACH payments which amount to $0.25 / transaction.  This amounts to less then $100 / month for a similar volume.  I can promise you that we would rather take ACH rather then CC.  Those cash back CC's are on the higher end of the fee charges and so, its an illusion to think you don't pay for that 3%.  In fact CC companies reciently got sued and lost because they made it against their terms to have different pricing for CC transactions vs cash.  There are basically only 3 CC companies and they all charge the same 3%.  If this isn't collusion I don't know what is.  
Now do me a favor and calculate the effect that 3% of the entire economy has going to the CC companies and tell me that this isn't insane amount of money going toward a convenience fee.  
And, OP is doing it wrong if he truly paid $50 in fees just for doing some moving of money.  You can move your money with no fees if you do it right.

The dollar as a medium of exchange is a good one for the most part.  Widely accepted, relatively stable, hard to counterfeit (but not that hard).  Bitcoin is more about being a global currency.  The dollar isn't going anywhere until there is no such thing as countries being separate.  But I see it one day becoming, ehh 1% of the global trade in the forseeable future, say in the next 10 years.  Maybe 20 years its hitting 5% of the global trade.  I think it would take more then 50 -70 years before it ever crossed the 10% global trade line.  100 years from now maybe hits 20% if they are still using it.

Not really, 
The correct market price will be more accurately reflected when the currency is more liquid.  Bigger adoption means more liquidity.  More liquidity means prices going closer to what the market thinks the price should be.  It doesn't take a lot of selling to add enough liquidity to make the price fall.  This added liquidity in addition to the fact that 3600 new coins are minted every day is causing significant downward pressure.  I'm actually surprised the price has held up as well as it has.  This fact alone tells you that new people are adopting bitcoin at a pretty steady rate which is slightly slower then the new coins minted every day.

@_date: 2014-01-11 18:15:00
Of course bitcoin doesn't have the same limitations as the gold standard since its infinitely divisible whereas gold isn't.  With gold coins you have to mint a completely new coin to adjust the value.  Bitcoin does this automatically.  I think the gold standard wasn't practical in a modern economy because your having to haul large chunks of heavy metal around to make it work.  These disadvantages disappear with a bitcoin backed economy.  I'm not an economist but if the only reason gold standard didn' work is because its not scalable then I don't think this argument applies to bitcoin.

Sure except you will sell at 600 and then it will go to 850 for 6 months.  Just when you break down and buy back at 850 it will drop to 550.  Just when you have waited long enough for it to go back to 900, you sell and it goes to 900.  its not as easy as it sound and in fact I have traded away over half of my bitcoin fortune trying to do this exact thing.  In the long run I would have been better just holding my original stake and forgetting about it this entire time.

Again, its a subjective statement.  Right now the price is crashing.  So this is the end of bitcoin right?  The signs are there.  Only, people have said this 50 times before.  So who do you believe?  If your right, then your lucky, if your wrong, then its your fault because the signs were there.  
I was there because they advertised as being the "largest most secure exchange"  and "the only reason deposits are being delayed is due to banks"  I just don't agree that its my fault that I got ripped off.  Telling me it is, is the same thing as me telling you that its your fault you got cancer.  Now I remind you that tobacco companies got sued for billions of dollars for saying they were safe, and new packaging and laws were developed which clearly states that its not safe.  Now after this accurate advertising, should I choose to continue, yes, then its my fault.  But I was never given that opportunity.  One day they were the safest largest exchange, the next day my coins are gone.  On what planet does it make sense that its my fault, that I should have known Mark was lying all the way from japan, amid all the doomsayers on a forum who had predicted the end of the planet 50 times and have been wrong every time.  I honestly thought this was just another round of FUD and that it would blow over like it had previously.  Partially because Mark has specifically stated that he kept all coins in cold storage.  I don't have time to look up the posts where he said that but i'm sure you already know about it.  Also, independant trusted people came in and verified that he was solvent at some point shortly before the site shut down.  
no, its not as clear cut as everyone likes to remember.  Not at all.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:48:16

They actually said that "scammer felons have a right to voice their opinion too."  My jaw dropped.

If this is true, then bitcoin is truly dead to me.  Apparently, I'm the only one who thinks this.  
The fact that MTGox didn't immediately halt trades and access after discovering the problem magnified my losses 20x.  Reports from Gox employees saying everything was fine, they have all the money when they don't enabled me to make trades that I would not have made had the exchange been closed sooner or they would have been honest about the losses sooner.  
If after this egregious deception that caused my losses, Mark walks from this with no repercussions, ie Jail, then there is no justice.  
I just cant be part of a system where there is no justice and anyone can just rip me off scott free which seems to be the case right now.  
In my opinion, it is immoral for anyone to participate.  If justice is not served, bitcoin is dead to me.

I would rather rely on their huge infrastructure to store them with out having to worry about one day losing them all incase coinbase decides to go evil or the government decides to shut them down.

lightning network simply takes the "waiting period" of transaction settlement and pushes it to the beginning of the transaction rather then the waiting part being when your trying to do the transaction.   With lighning you have to load the wallet up the day before and then the transactions are instant.  The waiting period comes when you load up ln wallet and then wait for the wallet to be funded, then you spend it instantly, vs bitcoin you have the funds in the wallet and then spend it but it takes 6 confirmations to be valid.

1) Justice needs to be served.  If we let him walk, that sets a bad example for the rest of the community that says, "doesn't matter if you were criminally negligent with your customers money, nothing will happen."  This benefits everyone.
2) If he is convicted, then it makes it much less likely that any "surplus" that is declared in the bankruptcy process will go back to him.  This directly benefits me.
3) It will make me feel better knowing that he will have a good long time to think about what he has done in a nice quite place.  The circumstances of how the money was lost is rage inducing to say the least.  To this day he has never admitted that he is directly or even indirectly responsible for it. This adds insult to injury.  So in that light he deserves it.  Lets call this icing on the cake.

please enlighten me.  I understand that with cold storage, the keys are stored off line in an impossible to hack way.  I would love to know how the coins were lost out of cold storage.  To this date, this has never been revealed.  
@_date: 2019-12-15 14:58:35
right now 
daily 144 blocks solved on average, maybe slightly more
12.5 btc per block * 144 blocks = 1800 new coins minted daily
1800 coins * $7500 per coin = ~$14M per day in coins being minted.

the halving is coming in about 4 months.  Right now about 14M per day needs to flow into bitcoin just to maintain the current price.  after the halving comes that money flowing in to maintain the price gets cut in half.  theoretically,  if only 7m needs to flow in to maintain the price and 10m is coming in, the price should start going up.
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:06:11
How can you even say that? He straight up told people he kept the coins in cold storage which was a blatant lie(I can find the exact bitcointalk post if you want me to).  He obviously didn't keep the coins in cold storage as they were all "stolen".  People who know how cold storage works put confidence in him since it was believed that cold storage was perfectly safe when he was lying about that.  This is at the very least fraud.  Had he actually put them into cold storage the coins would probably still be here.
He kept accepting trades after he knew the coins were gone.  He had a responsibility to treat everyone's funds properly and failed to do that.  He allowed people to lose more funds by failing to shut down the exchange in the final days after he knew the coins were gone.  This means that he knowingly allowed fraudulent trades to go through with no regard to the damage that it would cause.  
He most likely had a hand in disappearing some of the coins personally.

every day, 1800 new coins are added to the ecosystem so what 15M in new money has to enter the system just to keep the price at the current level.  if say one 10M enters the market every day, the price will slip.  this is whats happening right now, the "long slide" phaze which always happens after the mania of ATH.  remember when bitcoin was at $200 for like a year?  no one including me loaded up back then and we all regret it hardcore.  Its going to be exactly the same thing this time around.  Its going to keep slipping until the new coin generation equals the amount of new coins going into the market every day at which point we hit a stabilization point.  then it will stay there for a while until some new bubble mania starts again and pops us up over 50k or what ever the next new ATH will be.

Bitcoin forked a couple of times back in the day due to strange bugs and things happening.  the code was overnight changed to fix the issue and the newly changed/forked code became bitcoin after the majority quickly updated their full nodes and accepted the change as good for bitcoin.  The older broken fork and code died.  But in this case, rodger ver and the chinese bitcoin miners who wanted to cheat to make money forked bitcoin against the best interests of the majority and didn't have backing of most of the people.  Still to this day they don't have the backing of the majority.  But they are trying to say they are the real bitcoin even though the majority rejected that fork.  Its fine if you want to fork it, but if you don't have the majority backing you, you have no right to try and say your fork is the think you forked from.

not really.  of all coins, those new coins are extremely likely to be in the activly being sold group, which is not really true for the entire pool.  the downward pressure is real.  I call it "the long slide" and this effect has happened every time after an all time high.  the price drops over time until the number of sellers = number of buyers.  if we have a coin price of 50k and 1800 new coins a day getting generated, thats 90M a day in selling.  if there isn't 90M a day in buying, the price will slip down.  Then the next day we have a 40k price, thats 72M in new coins the next day.  again if we don't have 72M in buying, the price slips agian.  this happens until the price drops enough to equalize the buying.  Don't believe it?  Just wait until the reward halfs again and see what happens.

the argument against it going to 0 which is unrefutable is the following:
I will buy any and all bitcoin for $0.01 / bitcoin.  Unlimited amounts any time.  Therefore it cant go to 0.
I'm sure some one else will follow me by saying they will buy it for 0.02.  After a few million people one upping everyone before them, ooops were back to the free market system of exchange rates. well there you go.  It cant and will never go to 0.

its been proven that the hardware supports it, that dude has a patent on it, there was some api call that was uncovered to activate it,  that you would have to mine empty blocks sometimes to make it work, that you would have a huge advantage in profitability if you did use it, that segwit would break the ability to use it, etc, etc.

Just because it has gone up to 20k over a 7-year span doesn't mean it's going to continue going up like that in the future.

According to what I have read, that is not correct.  Empty blocks are 1 of 3 methods which asic boost can utilize to work.  source 
tldr; Option 1 – Produce empty or smaller blocks. This simply reduces the size of the Merkle tree and therefore fewer hashing operations are required to generate a different Merkle root hash. The extra nonce can therefore be varied in the normal way to produce more Merkle root hashes.

it doesn't need to work exactly like bgp, but the point is, there is a way to do distributed routing algo's. So are you actually destroying a strawman by saying that its not going to work because bgp is too centrialized or what exactly are you trying to convince me of?  Do you just not believe that coming up with a distributed routing algo is possible?  I'm just not sure what your trying to say here.

Mark never changed hot wallets after the first breach and the coins were slowly siphoned off over a period of a few years from the same hot wallet. Since there was no responsibility or care (auditing? simple accounting practices) put into handling other peoples money, the money being stolen many hundreds of times was never noticed. 
Sadly, had mark had a controller level accounting person, they likely would have noticed it within a month or two and saved everyone a lot of heart ache.

my only issue with alt coins in general is that unless the currency has "real world" application or at least might actually have real world application some day, its just a pyramid scheme.

1) don't daytrade
I had 500 btc back in the day.  Through my shitty daytrading i wittled that down to just over 300
2) never bet against bitcoin
I could have gone bigger then I did.  I knew from the first time I read the whitepaper it would be huge.  But I didn't act on this feeling and missed out on fuck you money.  But who knows, maybe its still not too late.. I thought I missed the train 2 years ago.  Maybe its true, owning a single bitcoin is all you really need to have that fuck you money some day.
3) don't hold any coin on an exchange.  
I lost 335 btc on the mt gox because I thought it was safer to trust a big company then me having the coins on my own fragile hard drive.  I didn't trust my self to store the keys since I work in IT and know how easy it is to lose data.  What an idiot I was.  The problem of holding your own keys is still a huge problem, but as with the btc-e and countless other exchanges getting taken out, its clear that thats way more risky then just doing it your self.

So far, I have been a fan of the blockchain solution.
  * the wallet uses browser side encryption
  * they have an easy backup solution that backs up the encrypted wallet to email or google drive at the touch of a button
  * they email and text you every time a transaction is made
  * offer dual factor authentication
  * you can still get your wallet open with multibit and the backup you made in the event that blockchain is down.  
  * you don't have to sync the blockchain every time you open your wallet
  * you can get access to your account from anywhere, not just your personal computer.  
Thats about it.

"Miners" (people who run mining hardware and software) will "confirm" transactions by including them into blocks on the [blockchain](  As more and more blocks get added to the block chain (this happens on average every 10 mins) your confirmation count goes up.  So after your transaction gets added to a block, thats 1 confirmation.  As another block gets added behind it, (doesn't have anything to do with you) you now have 2 confirmations and so on.  
Due to the way that the blockchain works, it becomes mathematically impossible to reverse transactions after about 6 confirmations. [see 51% attack](  The reason is that, each solved block comes from a random miner.  An attempt to re-write history would require that an evil miner gain more then 51% of the total network hashrate and go back in time, re-write all transactions to make then transaction that wants to refund go back to him, while outpacing the entire rest of the network.  This "attack" while still very difficult and expensive occur with just 1 confirmation but two, three, and up to six blocks getting solved by the same attacker, all in a row, all of which have the re-written history of events becomes mathematically impossible.  
It is up to each merchant to set up a risk model where they can choose to accept between 0 confirmations that confirm within a few seconds (probably ok for low dollar transactions) to 6 confirmations which takes about an hour (probably needed for buying cars, houses etc)


There are a few ways you could know who is sending you what.  
1) you could generate a new bitcoin address for each person who you interact with.  These addresses are like tracking addresses that you can assume since you only gave it out to that one person, and you know who that was, if you recieve funds there, you can pretty much assume it was the person whom you gave the address to.  
If you only have 1 address and publish it on your website, then you would have no way of knowing who sent the funds unless that person chose to let you know it was them. 


Have you tried  ?  I use it and it works well.  


Of all the things that I think would change things the most, it would be bitcoin ATM's.  The biggest problem with getting bitcoin at the moment is just getting the freaking currency to start.  If you could just drive down to your local store, put some cash in and get bitcoin back or vice versa, that would be the biggest game changer in my opinion.

While what your saying is true, mining has nothing to do with the price of a bit coin.  Its like saying that if the government printed a few million dollars a day, that it would change the price of the dollar.  I mean, yes, printing a million dollars has some tiny tiny insignificant fraction of a percent difference on the dollar, but not enough to move the price up or down.  Lets look at it another way, 1000 BTC is 0.01% of 10,000,000 BTC.  So even if I mined 100% of the 1000BTC, and dumped them all on the market at the same time, the best I could do would be to affect the price by 0.01% - 0.1% range.  No matter how many people mine, that number of coins will stay the same.  So its not really possible for mining to affect the market.  It only affects the miners profits.

This doc, is short, and a little technical, but if you can get through it, describes the genius and new idea of the "block chain" which is a decentrialized accounting ledger that allows the entire Bitcoin magic to happen.  With out this idea, none of it would be possible. And when you really dig into it, it becomes clear, that there isn't a better way to do it at the moment.  That is the end of the line. And the idea is simple yet genius enough that you really have to be blown away when you truely understand the concepts behind what they did.  Just reading that whitepaper sold me 100% 2 years ago.

So having the chips, boards, cases, and power supplies are all pre-requisites to getting my product.  Also, given the mentality of people, most people would have pre-ordered on the first day / week.  So if that has already shipped, this means that well over 50% of the order book has already shipped.  Since we know exactly how long this took, and we know that they are more efficient now then when they first started, we can reasonable say that its probable that they will be able to get through the remaining 40%-50% of the order book in less time then the initial 50% took.  With all this information combined, it would allow me to extrapolate the reasonable timeframe they claim to be fairly accurate.

I pulled 390M out of my ass based on my personal beliefs as well as lots of research on the forums of what is to come.  But if you do the research, some are predicting it will go over 1 Billion in the next 12 months.  I think slightly less then half is a reasonable place to ask your self if its worth it.  If its not worth it at that rate, its really not worth it if it goes any higher.  I see 0 % chance that it will be much lower then that.  
Joining a pool is basically your only option.  Solo mining would likely result in you never getting paid.  In effect its like playing the lotto.  In a pool, you're basically buying your share in with a group of say 20% of all other lotto players and will split the winnings according to how much you paid.

Your keys can not be seized even if running an online wallet.  The private keys are encrypted client side before being saved to the cloud and the encrypted private keys can be backed up. Even if they shut the cloud provider down and grab all their servers all they get is a bunch of encrypted data.  You could just drop a restore to a local version of the blockchain and move it to a different wallet address thereby completely eliminating your argument.  I see no disadvantages to using an online wallet as you described.

This is simplistic but simple math says that if the bitcoin economy gets to the scale that PayPal is now. (paypal does 315M per day  that leads to the math at worst case of:
$114Trillion / year = 21Million Coins / year
$5475 = 1 Coin

Traditionally, the larger the purchase the more confirmations are needed.  
In the 0 confirmation scenario, In reality, most people are not going around paying for things with stolen credit cards, nor are they going to go around paying for things with stolen bit coins.  However, yes it will happen, probably about the same amount that it already happens now.  
In reality, the retailer deals with this loss just like any other loss, passing it on as higher prices to the consumer.  This will be no different.  What will most likely happen is that, some company will pop up who specializes in detecting double spends, by having ears on all the major nodes in the country, yada yada, and warns the retailer that a double spend was detected.

the cost to generate a bit coin changes every 2016? blocks.  But I used to be able to generate a few coins a day with 2 video cards.  Now those same two cards would only generate 1 or 2 a month.  After the asic's flood the market next month, those same video cards would only generate a few bitcoins a year.  
So after the hardware is paid for, your basically just paying for the power at some point.  You need to be able to make a profit above that power bill to keep going.

If that is to be believed, then if you ordered now you would realistically get your order sometime in november or december.  If you don't think they will catch up as promised, then it could take longer.

I can confirm that the bfl.ptz.ro table is 100% me reading BFL_Jody's posts and then marking the corresponding order dates and shipped with absolutly 0 confirmation that they actually shipped or that the orders are actually real. 
And I have only been marking the posts that only have Jallys as shipped because currently BFL isn't shipping anything other the Jallys.

As promised I did attend.  I'm planning on writing up a detailed post about it tonight after I get off work.  A few quick observations
1. The ATM proof of concept was working.  However, according to the CEO's own words, they are a good 3-6 months away before they will start rolling out the ATM's
2. They indicated, that the financial regulations are not friendly in the USA. And that they were looking at europe as the first place to roll out.
3. People who were there were not allowed to use the machines for a live test.  They stated potential liability issues. 
4. A 10 minute wait would be required for someone to get cash from sending in bitcoins, but getting bitcoins from cash was instant.  
I could see this being not such a problem if you could go online, locate the nearest ATM, send the bitcoins ahead of time, and then walk down and get them.  I think that they should also consider having a card that they issue where transactions might go through instantly due to the customer having a backup payment method already on file with the bitcoin atm company.  
Bother things mean building a vast infrastructure.  A daunting task but with the right funding, defiantly possible.  
Overall I see the lack of support in US law as the major hurdle to being able to make this a reality.

QE actually makes it easier for governments to pay its debts by robbing value from the people.  14T dollars in debt today is only 7T in relative debt in 20 years when you have had 2.5% inflation over that timeframe.  Since Bitcoin cant inflate, its value is actually constant with exception to the new coins that are generated.  Coins should be a great store of value over the long term because they will retain their value when everything around you is constantly inflating.  
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:18:33
If you think about it, there is 0 reason to kill off bitcoin from the government point of view.  It is the best way to replace cash.
1) saves them money, no more worrying about counterfeiting, no more expensive printing presses, research and dev on counterfeit proof money.
2) makes the cash 1000% more traceable. All they have to do is let you slip up once about what your address is and bam they have your entire financial history.
In fact, I'm actually surprised they have not figure this out yet and started embracing it wholeheartedly.

I think maybe you just have unrealistic expectations of how business works in general.  The fact your calling me a moron tells me that your probably a 15 year old kid.  Or maybe just have the mentality of one. Why did you order with them if you couldn't wait them out?  I went through the same order process.  I have a 30k rig on order and I'm stressing about getting it but at the same time, crying about it isn't going to make it get here any faster.  And if your somehow successful and making them go out of business or what ever else you think your going to do, all it does is fuck me over.  Its not going to hurt them.  They will just have my money and I'll be the one who gets screwed.  Not them.  So yea, grow up and be patient.  Your shit is going to be delivered any day now.  They are less then 2 months away from having all the backorders shipped.. Almost 50% of the orders were placed on day 1.  They are 95% of the way through first day orders.  That leaves the other 50% for the entire rest of the queue.  Its taken them about 1 month to do first day orders.  It should take about 1 more month to do the rest of them.  Pretty simple stuff.

The protocol is defined to be precise up to 8 decimal places.  If you wanted to gain more precision, it would have to be a "majority vote" by all the users where they all decided to accept a new upgrade to the protocol / client software.  If the majority rejects the proposal, then the upgrade is not successful and it doesn't happen.  


That sounds about right.


Unfortunately, we have not hit star trek economics with unlimited resources that has made money pointless just yet.  Maybe you should be angry that they have not invented matter to energy conversion technology yet to eliminate the capitalist elite and worker underclass state.  The root of the problem is the lack of infinite resources.

The thing I don't understand, and hopefully you can clarify this is, with an off-chain transaction, couldn't I simply record the private key before I spend it, give you the private key (this is the definition of an off chain transaction??) and then just spend the money on the block chain an hour later, thus robbing you of your coins?

So then what is the point in waiting for it to drop?  Its not going to go down to $3 again.  That ship has left the dock.  Just to give an idea, I thought it would be fun to game the market try and get a few extra coins.  I sold 50 btc and rebought in for a net gain of 3 coins.  OK not bad.  Next time, i sold at 72 thinking this was it, absolute highest it would go before the next panic sell off.  Next day coins up $5.. I was like, shit, well they are going to crash again so I'll wait.  Nope, coins keep going up and up and finally the weekend rolls around (usually when they at a low point) so I buy back in at 92. Like the idiot i am, I set my buy price for 71, only hoping to make a small gain on the coins but nope,  Lowest they have gotten since is 75...
 Next day after rebuying at 92, coins surging and now they at 140.  For a net loss of 12 coins.  Fuck.  I would have been better off buying and holding.  Never bet against the coin.  Its bad luck.  So that little mistake of waiting cost me about $1500.00
@_date: 2013-02-23 21:27:50
I'm the first to admit that my memory isn't the greatest.  I remember shit being all crazy on to forums for a minute.  I was on mtgox the day that hack happened.  But yea I cant remember what the price was when the crash happened.  Maybe it was only at 10 at that point down from 30.  
It seems different this time then it did last time but I still feel like we might be seeing another smaller crash coming soon.

As to the stabilize point, how stable is the dollar vs the Yen for example.. 
Holy bitcoin, the dollar is not even stable against the yen...  The two largest economies on the planet.  
I think the safe answer is, prices will tend to stabilize as the market cap increases over time.  Volatility also doesn't matter in bitcoin is also true.  Businesses can accept bitcoin in liu of credit cards, experience lower processing fees, (finally we have broken the credit card monopoly) and retailers can recieve payment in dollars, this eliminating the volatility factor.  
So the answer is both views are correct.  It will stabilize over time as the economy gets bigger and volatility doesn't matter.

I managed to mine 125 ish of them with the help of two ATI 5970's back when the difficulty was low.  Then when the bubble happened, I didn't sell them at 30, but waited till they had dropped back to about 12 ish.  I had cash in mtgox but at that time, dwolla was locked down and wasn't allowing withdrawals so I just left the money in and forgot it for a while.  Then ?several months? later I checked and the price was at around 3, so I just re-purchased them at that point thinking all good since I was invested about 1500 for my mining rig and that was it.  And I am a gamer so I figure what the hell I got a nice gaming system out of it.  
So with out saying how many I have exactly, you can kinda do the math on that.

I was buying at $3 each. 2 years ago. asics were not available and back then I thought about going large. I decided it was too risky. a year later I did invest that 30k on an ASIC as soon as it looked like it was not going to take that long. my thinking was that no one was going to risk that sum of money so I would be making a good choice. little did I know everyone bought rigs and my 30k was not going to Roi. hadi just put the 30k in when I first thought about it I could have got between 5000 and 10000 coins which would now be worth over a million.

asics are flooding onto the market at the moment. coins are being generated at least 25% faster then normal. miners are dumping coins to "make their money back". as soon as the ASIC flood is over and the miners have made their money back, the dumping will stop and miners will change their strategy to holding. this process will take at least 4 months.

Even if this were possible, and a real threat, in my mind it could be quickly identified as coming from certain IP's and blocked.  The only way this could possibly work is if the attacker not only held 51% of the hashing power, but also had these nodes around the globe on different IP blocks and made the attack happen very subtly.  Any direct attack would immediately be detected and it would be short order before everyone who was tired of being ddos'd would simply block the ip's responsible for it.  Dr Evil's ddos would last all of 24 hours and would be thwarted.  
@_date: 2013-10-20 22:10:40
I don't think that hash rate will decrease as block halfing occurs.  If anything, it reduces inflation and causes coins to be worth more, upping the incentive to grab what remaining coins exist.

Fair enough.  
What defines a "better" cryptocurrency?  Is the "best" currency the one with the most users?  The one with the fastest confirmations?  The one with the highest dollar / coin ratio?  The one with the most anonymity?  The one easiest to convert to fiat?  
Some alt/scam coins already have some of these features.  Maybe a "better" currency is already out and just has not gained acceptance. 
Maybe the "better" currency is the one that most people use.  In that case, there would be a long slow time frame where the up-and-coming currency creeps up on the bitcoin until enough people decide that it really is time to make the switch and go to the new system.  Presumably there would have already been sufficient time for an exchange to form which allows bitcoin to be exchanged with "better"coin and vice versa.  At some point the two coins would reach parity and then the "better"coin would overtake bitcoin in exchange rate value.  
Queue a long slow slide where bitcoin moves farther and farther into irrelevance until finally its just a distant memory of our fathers and grandfathers.  Finally it would have been written into the history books for our ancestors to learn in school.

I bought two amd 5770's and spent 1500 on a mining rig, mined 300 btc in a few months and then the price dropped.  I stopped mining because the cards made my house really hot and i figured the $3 coins were not even paying the power.  Wish I had stuck with it more.  spent about 100 of that on stupid shit and giving away tips.  I really wish i had mined the entire time instead of just for the two months and maybe been a little bit more careful with the coins..

how would it work?  I mean, bitcoin is the only non-reversible electronic payment that exists.  If bitpay were to take usd, it would have to be in the form of you going to their bank and depositing the funds.  checks, credit cards, paypal, etc are all reversible and bitpay would be opening themselves up to massive fraud and losses with chargebacks.  There is no practical way to do this.

I'm thinking it will go up to around 300TH/S when all said and done.  Currently there is 60TH/S and I see another 150 TH/S just in BFL orders alone.  However, its quite likely that ASICS will push most GPU's out.  So you will be replacing 30TH/S that goes away when the difficulty makes in unprofitable to GPU mine.

Yes, and they also led everyone to believe they were going to respect state laws.  (
Quote: "As a general matter, pursuit of these priorities should not focus federal resources in your States on Investigations and Prosecutions in States Authorizing the Medical Use of Marijuana individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana. For example, prosecution of individuals with cancer or other serious illnesses who use marijuana as part of a recommended treatment regimen consistent with applicable state law, or those caregivers in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state law who provide such individuals with marijuana, is unlikely to be an efficient use of limited federal resources."

the only valid consideration is if you will be able to mine more then the initial cost of the device. if you paid 10btc for something and it will only mine 8 btc in return you would have been better off holding the 10btc. if you can mine say 12 btc then you are probable better off mining.

Hey, competition doesn't scare me.  People had access to GPU's for years and even FPGA's and mining was still profitable.  This is no different.  People were saying the same thing back when GPU mining first came out.  Everyone still made money if they just stuck to it.  This is no different.  The economics have not changed in the slightest.


I was mining when the difficulty was under 50k.  I have already turned a $1500 investment into a 30k return.  I also bought 1500 of bitcoin when they were under $3.00 each.  That alone is well over 20x.  I am now purchasing a rig with that same money, which I originally spent less then 1500 to get.  For the record, I did purchase in april.  I'm so far ahead of the game at this point, it would be impossible to lose.  


Who's instilling confidence in anyone?  I believe that if you are going to try and get a refund literally 30 days before your rig is to be delivered, then your fucking retarded.  At this point, if you started your refund process, you would get your money back on the same day your rig was to be delivered.  How is that good advice?

apparently they are not going to fork the chain and go back, and are letting the attacker get away with it.

I can tell you exactly why.  Everyone is getting their shiny new asics.  So what do you do?  Start mining.  Bam, generate those coins that normally would not have been generated that fast.  Now what?  Dump those extra coins for quick cash no matter the price to get your return on your investment.  
The price will continue going down for the forseeable future as more asics needing to be repayed come online and people dumping to get payback on their rig.  
As soon as the shipping bubble is popped and asics are out there, and they are repayed, people will again shift back to holding after their initial payment is paid back.  
I predict at least 2 more months of downtrends followed by slow uptick in price and then another bubble maybe in the next 12 months.

it might as well have been.  all the coins mined in such a short period of time give most of the coins to a very select few who were lucky enough to hear about it in the 6 month window.  in my mind if you dont give everyone a fair shot to mine, then its basically premined.

@_date: 2013-05-15 05:56:54
yes.. they are. the difficulty has been going up by 15% or more for months. that means we generated 4000 blocks faster then the target forcing a retarget, only to have that retarget again beat again by another 15%. each time you beat the target that means by definition that coins are being generated faster then normal.   over the course of weeks and months of this process continuing more coins then what would have been expected would have been generated.

Many also said it is premined.  But what exactly is the definition of not being pre-mined?  If I shout my new coin address in the wind so one homeless person heard me. Is that enough notification and then immediately begin mining it all is that enough notification?  Do I have to email it to one person?  Post it on an obscure board first?  Take an add out in the alaska newspaper?  How much of an announcement qualifies in your mind as not being preminded?  Because if a well connected individual who follows the subject closely didn't hear about it before the premine period was over, was this truely not a premine?  Was even 1 quarkcoin spent before they were all mined?  Nope this is perfectly fair.  I see your point.  How stupid of me to think this was totally unfair.

1.  "In case you didn’t notice it, the delivered unit is different than the picture on the website. They had to install 2 power supplies instead of 1 and had to modify the case to fit. Also, if you didn’t notice, the LCD/Phone thingy in the front has been replaced by … a piece of cardboard spray painted black. Wonderful."
Like Jr said himself that he took the nexus tablet out and was playing with it.  It doesn't ship with a colored piece of cardboard. 
2.  "A twenty two thousand dollar box of electronics that is broken out of the box, that required the guy to do a sketchy electrical workaround to get partially working, that he is going to install in a window… and he’s happy about it?."
Putting a 22,000 box in your house might be a bad idea.  Running a box that requires 7500 watts off a shitty home circuit might be a bad idea.  BFL has stated multiple times that the mini-rig should be run on 220 power.  I'm thinking if I have the money to buy this expensive of a magical money printing machine that prints money, I might just put that sucker in a datacenter where it belongs instead of hanging it out my window where my neighbor might accidently spray it while watering his lawn. 
3. "Let’s take a look inside this guy. This is from an earlier version of the Minirig (note the single power supply) but it will give you a good glimpse at what kind of craftsmanship you can expect from a computer that is half the average household income in the United States."
This isn't even the same unit.  This is the FPGA unit from two years ago.  You misrepresent the facts when you make it sound like this is the unit everyone is getting.  100% not true.
4. "But Alas, the chips don’t run nearly as well as they’re supposed to, frequently running too hot and giving multiple hardware failures. Coindesk noted in one of the first ever runs of the Minirig by hosting provide gigavps that it was running much too hot and erroring out." 
gigavps got a demo model to program on even before the final firmware has been released. He never said it was too hot an erroring out.  What he said was "It's been up and down numerous times as I've been chipping away at the code to make it work at its theoretical maximum 480GH." and "Looks spot on for 480GH. HW errors ~0.7%. Yes, unit 4 looks hotter than the rest but no throttling appears to happen till 90."  
 Luke Jr says "The good news is, it all seems to be working for the most part."
Your statement that it was a broken down piece of shit that didn't work right is just not true.  
5. "So, what happens if you just decide you don’t want this, you don’t want to wait over a year to get a $22,000 broken piece of shit? Nothing, because BFL won’t let you cancel your preorder because they’re now “shipping”, i.e. they sent out one unit to their own company shill."
Great so sell it on ebay for 5x what you paid for it.  
Just saying, this article is biased and therefore people shouldn't give it a high degree of trust.

The data shows order backlog days.  However, I think we can both agree there is no way to draw any meaningful conclusions as to how long it will take to finish the order queue based on this information.  
It lacks the order distribution.  So logically, shouldn't the data points more heavily weigh a day where 500 units were ordered and shipped then a day where only 5 units were ordered?  For each day where 500 units were ordered and shipped, that would take the same amount of time as 100 days of orders where only 5 orders were made.  
In order for the data to be an accurate representation of "how long" it will take for an order placed on a certain day to become fulfilled, you would need to know 
1) how many orders were placed on each day
2) what the overall capacity to fulfill orders is.  
You don't have either of those numbers since they don't release them.  Therefore, this chart while cool looking, tells you 0 information about future performance father out then a few days.  
Am I wrong?

Mining is a fools errand, and should only be taken up by the people who don't care that they are giving up potential profits to secure the network.

my inv number is 15700 range on 4/15/2013.  That means there was about 1000 new invoices between march and april.  March to June was 17200 between april, may, june which breaks down to 5700 invoices per month after the 4/15/2013 time frame.
So that seems like, the pre-orders were fairly thin (maybe less then 1000 orders a month) up until 4/15/2013 and then significantly jumped to over 5,000 invoices a month 5/01/2013.  The preorder's would seeem to be heavily weighted to 5/1/2013 and later.  
So maybe 12,000 orders for the first 8 months of preorder and then 17,000 orders the last 3 months.  
This is just a guess.

This is cool but completely different then bitcoin
This paper describes is not peer to peer and requires a bank to facilitate transactions.  Also no mention of the blockchain or mining.  So basically the only concept that is similar is the public / private keys that encrypt the "tokens" but its still cool read and a good find.
     Alice creates an electronic coin, including identifying information.
     Alice blinds the coin.
     Alice sends the blinded coin to the Bank with a withdrawal request.
     Bank verifies that the identifying information is present.
     Bank digitally signs the blinded coin.
     Bank sends the signed blinded coin to Alice and debits her account.
     Alice unblinds the signed coin.
     Alice gives Bob the coin.
     Bob verifies the Bank's digital signature.
     Bob sends Alice a challenge.
     Alice sends Bob a response (revealing one piece of identifying info).
     Bob verifies the response.
     Bob gives Alice the merchandise.
     Bob sends coin, challenge, and response to the Bank.
     Bank verifies the Bank's digital signature.
     Bank verifies that coin has not already been spent.
     Bank enters coin, challenge, and response in spent-coin database.
     Bank credits Bob's account.
Note that, in this protocol, Bob must verify the Bank's signature before giving Alice the merchandise. In this way, Bob can be sure that either he will be paid or he will learn Alice's identity as a multiple spender.

Bitcoin introduced several new revolutionary concepts which makes the whole "digital money" thing a reality.  The block chain, distributed time stamping, etc.  Many people are trying to make a "better" version with the alt/scam coins.  However, they all rely on the concepts that didn't exist before bitcoin.  In order for a truly better version to come out, it will depend on fixing problems with the existing system in a new way that has not been invented yet.  None of the alt/scam coins are going to fill this role.  In short, bitcoin is a revolutionary idea that didn't exist before and its going to take something equally revolutionary to replace it.

Its actually the only logical trend that any highly demanded preorder follows.  


Thats an opinion.  One you are free to have.  I can evaluate each statement on its own merit and be perfectly fine to not believe one thing you say but believe something else.   Why don't you go ask all the avalon guys how there doing right now?


So you have a phd in psychiatry now?  Nice.  I think you might be projecting your own unstable personality onto others.  Your definitely blowing out of proportion the effect that a 30k purchase would have one someones long term livelyhood.  Hint, almost 0.  
Or are you one the angry 14 year olds that saved for 2 years to buy a single because they thought they were going to make 9000% return on it in two days? If so, you fit into the first category of ragers that didn't have the patience or business to even get into this game. 
Fact is, only two different types of ragers.
1) Those who spent more then they could afford and put way too much hype on making money from some magical money printing machine, and out of genuine anger rage daily about how BFL has ruined their lives 
2) The 14 year old crybabies that ordered a little single or even a jala and didn't get it when BFL said they would and now is on a crusade to ruin them because world of warcraft is boring.
A real business man knows how to roll with the punches.  Doesn't over extend.  Doesn't over invest in any one thing.  Knows what risks he is taking when he parts with his money.  Accepts when shit happens its not the end of the world.   
These types of people are the grown ups.  The guys that have successfully run large businesses and make lots of money in the long run.  They don't let temporary setbacks or delays ruin them or their emotional state.  
Could I be a huge raging faggot all the time about the delays and lies as you call them that I have been told.  Sure I could.  But thats just not how I roll.  I have accepted the fact that my product is getting slightly delayed.  I still think I'll make a 10x return on my investment in the long run.  So I'm not worried about it in the slightest.  
So again, if there is something that you and I agree on, its that stupid bitches that cant roll with some punches shouldn't be trying to buy mining gear.  Leave that to the big boys who can tolerate waiting years to make a return on their investments.  Thats where this game ultimately is headed.  Eventually, the only money that comes to the miner is transaction fees.  
If your not down to wait years to get a small return on your investment, mining is not for you.  Its a race to 0.  
 Anyone who doesn't accept this as the base premise for being a miner should not spend one single penny on mining gear from any company ever, and should instead just simply buy the coins that others have mined.  
@_date: 2013-03-26 08:37:10

10k units and to half way done means that they will have sold about 20k-25k units. 25000 units with an average cost of 1k each would be $25,000,000 in per order money.

As a long time bitcoin enthusiast here, my answers below


The code is open source and has been reviewed hundreds/thousands/millions of times by virtually every smart person on the planet.  They do find bugs in the client software, however, the mathematical foundation behind securing the bitcoin has never been breached.  Infact, if it were to ever be breached, all encryption everywhere would be useless.  


There are hundreds of "alt coins" already in existence.  However, the infrastructure isn't in place like it is with bitcoin.  The bitpay's/gyfts of the world kind of cement bitcoins placement as the digital currency.  Until another payment service comes out that accepts some other virtual currency, there is little to no danger of that changing.  


This site, and bitcointalk.org are my two primary sources of info on the topic.  This site is a bit more circlejerk, and bitcointalk is going to be a bit more technical and trollish.  Take anything either site says with a grain of sand.

If you read my post history, I have always maintained that mining is a waiting game.  If you don't have the ability to be patient, you cant be in this game.  I don't have a problem with the current scenario, I'm perfectly happy to wait till my rig gets here.  
Nor am I anyone's dad.  I could be some raving lunatic with mental instabilities for all anyone knows.  If anyone takes even a shred of anything I say to make their buying decisions, they are more crazy then I could be.  I take no responsibility for any one elses good or bad choices.  I have also stated this many times.

Its called bitcoin days destroyed.  But I don't think it excludes the exchanges.  This is just all bitcoins and how much they are getting traded.  
for each day a bitcoin goes untraded, it adds a day.  When ever that bitcoin finally gets traded, it destroys all the days since the last time it was traded.  So if a bitcoin goes untraded for 10 days then gets traded, that is 10 bitcoin days destroyed.  
So the more bitcoin days destroyed, the more trading goes on.

This is just plain common sense.  It doesn't take a mathmatical model to figure out that people likely to purchase a bitcoin mining machine are in the know about BFL early on and placed their order the first moment it was availabile.  Follow a long trailing trickle of those less informed people. Doesn't take a genius to figure this one out.


I'm not implying it, they straight up said it in official communications multiple times.  The latest being a mass email to all the customers that happened just a few days ago.


I assure you, I have all the most up-to-date info available to the general public.  Namely scouring the internet, forums, and people in the know about whats going on over there.  It is true I don't know if they will finish by the deadline that they sent a few days ago, but it is in the realm of possibility, and therefore would like to think positively that they will actually not fuck this up.

No, but I do tend to look at things logically.  And when people go around spewing garbage, I cant let it go.  Everyone who has done any research knows exactly what happened.  
1) BFL was finishing up their design for the asic last OCT / NOV timeframe when they discovered their mistake and the power and cooling was way over budget
2) they are like OH shit, thats not good.  We have to re-design the board and cooling to accommodate our real world tests that didn't match what our theoretical model predicted.  
3) 6 month delay ensues while they start over from almost scratch to redesign PCB, Case, power supply, etc.
4) bitcoin community the majority of which isn't able to read between the lines doesn't understand what just happened and how fucked the situation is, but they will.  Pitchforks and torches get taken out of storage.  
5) in the meantime, I wait, knowing exactly what is going on for the tidal wave of dumbasses who were expecting 5000% returns on their money in the first 30 days all give up and cancel.  I laugh because in my line of work, getting a return on your money in the first 12 months is fucking awesome.  
So in short, I am not defending BFL more then I am calling out dumbasses for getting into a "business" that they had no ability, understanding, or patience to be in the first place.  This amuses me to no end and I thank you for your words.  It validates my existence on this forum.

Technically, bit coin is much easier to track then cash.  Imagine if the money supply had rfid tags that could be tracked in real time.  You might not know exactly who had the money but you would know where it is and through statistical analysis could account for probably 98% of all the transactions to a specific person over time.

Transaction fees are not driven to zero.  You see, currently, each "block" which is like a page in a book, only has so much "space" in it.  The block sizes are capped at a certain maximum size.  If your transaction includes a fee, your transaction gets prioritized.  Right now, there is open space in the blocks that doesn't get used since the transaction volume isn't high enough to completely fill every white space in every block.  It is expected that in the future, the transaction volumes grow, those blocks will actually start filling up.  If that happens, then the free transactions will not be confirmed in that block and will get pushed down to the next block.  Eventually when the transaction volume is high enough, it might take weeks or months to get a free transaction to confirm.  At this point, unless you have a transaction that you can wait 2 months to confirm, it would be in your best interest to put a transaction fee on it.  Also, I believe that the higher the fee, the higher priority it would get.  So there is effectively a supply/demand mechanism built into the actual blocks which can be adjusted by community consensus.  But the long and short of it is, that the community will do what it must do to keep things from going badly as they are all self invested in it.  
This is just my understanding of how it works, someone else feel free to correct anything I have just said.

I have been following this market since the difficulty level was at under 50k.  The price went up like this one other time.  IT was a pump and dump scenario where everyone got excited about it, started buying.  Mtgox got hacked and bam, it was dump city.  I had sold everything I mined at ~12.00.  I wish I had sold at 30.  When it dropped back to 3, I bought back up at that price.  Now were back to 30...  
I doubt it will ever go back to 3.. those days are most likely gone.  But it might go back to 10.  
I just keep thinking of the guy that went all in at 30.  Like the two weeks later it was at 3...  Poor bastard I wish I could find that forum post.

  I don't know about you but getting a 30% haircut just because I decided to hold yen vs dollars doesn't really seem much better then the 380% you mentioned.  So the point is, its relative.  Bitcoin being a smaller market cap, is more prone to currency swings which in turn shorten the time that you can safely hold the currency before its no longer worth what it was when you got it.  Dollars vs yen, took 3 years to get a 30% haircut.  Dollars vs Bitcoins took 6 months to go from nothing, to bubble, to ~ 100.00 each.  As when anything, when the growth rate is too fast, it causes problems.  This is a classic case of growth outpacing supply and support  chains and then correcting back to more sustainable levels.

If they drop asic mining, I'm basically done with bitcoin. A rule change that big would fuck over the entire system in my mind.  Millions of dollars have been invested in asic technology.  Also, the value of bitcoin is that the rules were clearly established in the beginning when it started.  If they could just make a change that big then in my mind, bitcoin is bullshit because they can make any change they want at any time.  I think nobody would dare risk alienating the entire mining community with such a change.  Because it would piss every one of them off royally.  
As a bitcoin miner, I choose with my asic where to put my computing power.  Getting asics out to as many people as possible not only creates a new industry that will make the price of asics drop significantly and make them more wide spread, but it could eventually spark an entire revolution in quantum computing for those researchers always trying to get the advantage.  I'm only in favor of abandoning the current system if an even better faster technology comes along.  If I wanted to go back to GPU's I would switch to litecoin.  The system isn't broken so don't fuck with it.

If you have free electricity, then you have less to lose then people who pay for electricity.  Go to a mining calculator and put a difficulty of 350,000,000 in as the difficulty.  Do your calculations based on that number.  It is a reasonable estimate on the possible difficulty that will be there by the time you get your machine if you ordered now.  Make your own judgement.

I time the bottom all the time.  Yes you cant hit the exact moment of its lowest point, but it doesn't matter.  If you bought in at 1000 and are now wondering what to do you have two options.  
1) hold.  I know its hard to believe now, but if you hold for 2 years, you will be a happy camper.  Nothing about the fundamentals of bitcoin has changed.  Its still just as useful today as it was yesterday.  I'm sorry that you bought in during a bubble, however, the idea that bitcoin is either going to 0 or to 100000 a coin still holds true.  If you think its going to 0 (hint: not going to happen) then sell now.. but if you don't believe that, then its going to 100000, you should just hold
2) dollar cost average.  You want to get more value out of your bad purchasing decision to buy when the thing was hyped and overvalued, now is your chance to put half as much in again (double down) and get 2x for 1.5.  This is a common investing strategy and is a well accepted practice.  This still involves holding, however it brings your average purchase price down from 1000 to $750, which would still involve waiting until the fundamentals catch up to the hype. 
If your investing in bitcoin for short term gain and you have lost your money, then i feel no sympathy for you.  Your get rich quick mentality is bad for the long term stability of bitcoin and hopefully you learned a valuable lesson.  Speculation is what caused the economy to crash, the housing bubble, and every other bad economic crash in recent memory.

I thought you had asked how it was possible to be better to spend cash vs bitcoins for the mining rig.  My example seems to have fulfilled that.

They seemed to be concerned that forking the chain would make feathercoin lose credibility.  I'm guessing they are not 100% sure they could actually get everyone to go back which would make resolving the forked chain take days or weeks to sort itself out.  I'm not 100% sure what exactly the implications of doing this is or if what I said is even correct..

My understanding is that this is not possible.  You can not do useful work with the mining operations because the work is completely random.  I would say this is bullshit.

As someone who is STILL waiting for my minirig from BFL this is very much a bummer.

People who don't understand how mining works are overpaying for pre-orders.  Take advantage of that.

if you think it's pointless to do something nice for the CEO of reddit that's your business.  :)
But lets be honest for a second.  Aside from financially supporting reddit isn't reddit gold pointless already?
I was hoping that for two seconds the CEO of reddit might think to himself. hey you know that's kinda cool, I was sitting here doubting bitcoin and then bam, some random guy who I don't even know just paid me $3 in bitcoin reddit gold.

Its already hard enough to get people to accept bitcoins, but now your asking them to accept 5 different currencies, with 5 different exchange rates, all of which need to be accepted or convertible to what their suppliers accept.  I see it as being a cool experiment but seems to be difficult to believe that the alt currencies will ever actually take off unless a major breaking bug that cant be fixed is found with bitcoin.

If i have 100 orders every day for the first month, and 1 order every day for the 2nd month the slope of what could be called "order days destroyed" will not tell an accurate picture.  If you had a gap of 30 days which no orders were placed, you would find your graph suddenly cutting 90 degrees and taking a huge jump toward 0 mark.  While it is true that some info can be derived from past data, no useful information can be derived about future performance.

At first I thought you were asking if anyone had used BitCoin.  I was thinking, Is that guy really asking the bitcoin forum if anyone has used bitcoin?

@_date: 2013-08-11 19:30:31
if you can convince me that some alt coins are good I might agree. at this moment I see no useful purpose for alt coins with the exception of them being test coins. but to assign actual value to them makes me think they are just a copy of the original and therefore a scam. like making a copy of Mona Lisa and saying it has the same or better value of the original. its not based on anything new. it's just a copy of a masterpiece. to claim it has value it's ripping off the original creator.

I wish they had more choices in my area.  For a while I was ordering pizza from them on weekends(both places were from smaller pizza houses that I would never have ordered from normally due to not knowing about them).  But both of the pizza choices somehow dried up and now all there is sushi.  I don't like sushi.  So I have a $40 credit with them and no way to spend it.

The only contender for a worldwide currency at the moment is Bitcoin or some version of it.  However, since this puts everyone on an equal playing field, this removes a lot of power away from governments to spend money they don't have.  If this particular currency did become the global standard, it would remove governments ability to print money "QE" when ever they need to.  This will make wealth distribution more fair as a dollar (or satoshi) now will be worth a dollar next year and 20 years from now.  
Unfortunately this removes a tool that governments use to control peaks and valleys in the economic cycle.  It will require them to figure out other ways to manipulate economic conditions without having direct control over the money supply.  Ultimately, this will be a good thing as the current policies can and are abused to the benefit of the rich at the expense of everyone else.

 I think that if Gyft blows up because of their early adoption of bitcoin, that should be a model that other retailers would want to follow.
