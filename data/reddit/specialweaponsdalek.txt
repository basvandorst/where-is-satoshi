"The real question here, from a legal standpoint, is what duty Bitfinex owed to you beyond standard security measures."
Except that they failed to supply those standard security measures.  Bitfinex and BitGo have been utterly incompetent.  They've made false claims about how good their security is.  This hack is ridiculous.  Someone walked off with $70 million in bitcoin thanks to BFX's shoddy setup, and BitGo the security experts just signed off on it like it was fine.

There's a huge difference between bitcoin, and a bitcoin exchange company or a bitcoin security company used by that exchange.  A degree of human based failsafes are not only reasonable, but essential, for the latter. 
You attitude is what makes hacks like this possible.  "Don't ever have a human do a double check, whatever the computer wants is fine."

As you say, feels just like MtGox.  Remember the constant lack of solid info, the constant waiting in the dark.  Deadlines are missed, and then the update is "There will be an update later."
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:49:47
All this delaying and shifting deadlines feels exactly like back when MtGox stopped all withdrawals.

When you see really smart people do really dumb things, it boggles the mind.  These people are the geniuses of networking, programming, cryptography, subtleties of complex code.
But no one thought to say "Hey, if someone suddenly tries to withdraw like 119,000 bitcoin worth $70 million from one of our clients, it might be time to throw a human into the mix and just do a quick double check.  You know, go old school and call them up for a video conference, maybe check some paperwork."
No, no, no! We're geniuses.  We've coded clever heuristics!  Advanced cryptographic protocols!  We're 100% secure!

This is all implausible in the extreme.  A company that exists to give security to bitcoin storage signs off on 119,000 bitcoins being stolen, about $70,000,000 worth at that time.  Give me a break.

Problem is, most people cut MtGox a lot of slack too.  At the time, most people had no concept of how bad things were.  We just kept swallowing the BS.
It's now been almost six hours since the last moment they could have kept their word on the update.  That's being generous and giving them until a moment before midnight EST.  
The last update we get is "Sorry, missed the deadline," and then all is silence.  Where $70 million is involved, that is pretty far out from acceptable.  If that doesn't make you worry, maybe it should.

I'd say BitGo fucked up regardless of whether Bitfinex sent them bad information.  The whole point of security is to detect bad information and prevent it being used to steal.  119,000 bitcoins worth $70 million, and BitGo didn't question it?  No mechanism said "Whoa, that looks really odd, better check this?"
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:51:49


Fringe cases like hackers stealing $70 million?  Yeah, those fringe cases.
But no, please, double down on "Don't ever have a human do a double check, whatever the computer wants is fine."  Seems the programmers at Bitfinex and BitGo have the same concept of a sanity check as you do.
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:12:44
All that means is that being protected by BitGo means absolutely nothing to a user. They are totally worthless.
If they put their names to companies they know are full of security holes, and they'll happily sign off on transactions that are fraudulent, then they are just as responsible as those companies.
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:18:00
Yeah, why should big investors be put off bitcoin just because teams of genius programmers at the top exchange and bitcoin security companies, after years of experience, work, and cryptographic analysis, still can't stop $70 million dollars being stolen in the blink of an eye?

I got a bad feeling it's a lot worse than that.  And people who lend out U.S. dollars for margin trading will be hard hit, which sucks because that was supposed to be one of the safest options on the site.
