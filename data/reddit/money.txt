[Here you go]( I blocked the numbers out just in case it's against the rules here to post stuff like that but if anyone wants I can PM it to them.
Edit: I didn't check the date and it looks like I got it Wednesday, I just saw it today as an unread text and I thought it was sent to me today. Not sure if that matters at all but just want to document the right info for other people. Only a few people have this number and I don't sign up for anything that would warrant a text like this, very strange.

Yes, I'm curious. I can take a picture of my check from work and have it in my account in under a minute, I can go to the store and scan a barcode on my phone to withdraw cash from my account, I have a PayPal debit card I can also use to make purchases and use at any atm or store the world. I can get a loan in minutes on their website, I can also send money to anyone in the world instantly instead of using a bank that can take days sometimes and I don't need to wait for it to be confirmed all day on a network either, convert currency, receive money instantly and run a business with it entirely. All of that relies on technology, so I'm curious as to what parts of said technology is outdated? People just say stuff here and don't explain any further, I would like to know.

When's the last time the real Satoshi said something? Couldn't he just come out and say that this guy is a fraud?

Let's pretend it's true for a moment, let's say out of nowhere one morning they release a statement and start accepting. What are everyone's predictions for price, say a week later?
