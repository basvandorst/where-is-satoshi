One day :)

Starbucks is where mass adoption begins. More people than I've ever met will be buying coffee with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:38:02
Good point. Perhaps they're European. In which case, they could go spend their bitcoin at one of the 65,000 retailers that accept it in Switzerland.
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:21:23
Starbucks has plans to accept BTC soon, what are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:15:03
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:20:27
Once people figure out they can buy Frappacinos with BTC there's no turning back
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:37:12
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:17:26
It already \*is\* a worldwide currency. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:22:15
No one = you
@_date: 2019-11-01 14:06:03
Is he mining crypto during this live set??
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:41:53
Starbucks will help with this task shortly
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:42:28
bitcoin isn't sentient bro
@_date: 2019-11-14 01:08:22
Yeah it will. Bitcoin knows no borders.
@_date: 2019-11-04 21:23:47
...but why do I need a personality? &gt;:(
@_date: 2019-11-15 19:07:33
Hint: try looking outside of the United States
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:56:14
You're ignoring that people around the world already use BTC to pay for their daily living expenses. Open your eyes, bud. Your perspective is incredibly narrow.

One company with 30,000 locations worldwide, with $24.71 billion dollars of revenue in 2018.
Congrats, you're downplaying the significance.

"a" vs "the"
@_date: 2019-10-27 20:42:03
17250, Bob.
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:21:34
But it shows that bitcoin can be quickly adopted and implemented by society when the circumstances change
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:34:42
I think I read that around 3-4 million of the 21 are lost. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2019-10-27 20:45:11
The time to buy was under 8k, if you were really lucky or strategic, you could have bought at 7,500.
In other words, you'll get more for your money if you wait for a dip.

This has more to do with your gambling habits than it does bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:40:12
18 million mined / 21 million available. Eventually transaction fees will subsidize the reward for mining, and then after they're all mined (in 100+ years) they'd sustain themselves entirely from transaction fees. 
At least that's how I understand it.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:43:02
Damn, sorry. Didn't know that.
LocalBitcoins maybe?

The apocalyptic collapse that *is* on schedule is climate change

Have you been to Venezuela recently?
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:36:15
I've never seen it explained so simply, cheers
@_date: 2019-12-14 12:29:35
That aged well, didn't it?
