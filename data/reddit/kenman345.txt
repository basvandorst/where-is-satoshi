I don't think segwit has proven anything until it activates.
Faith in segwit may be higher though, I'll give you that much. 
Also remember that the BCH stuff hasn't fully readjusted the difficulty for their global hashing rate to make sense. Both chains right now have a lot to prove in the coming weeks. Regardless of how much you believe in the code or the concepts it's nothing till it goes through and is in use. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:06:25
Okay so it's an odd choice of words to say it needs to have a larger block as part of it but it instead is compressing the transactions through the use of segwit to store more per block.
I just have a problem with it still as it makes it seem like we are getting the NYA agreement if you only read the top half but it seems more likely we get another split
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:06:33
Was not aware, good to know
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:20:51
using Nicehash?
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:28:35
Long term? no. 
Short term? Possibly.
The fact is transaction fees will remain high while people can get away with asking for them. The backlog of transactions has a better hope of clearing with Segwit enabled on the chain but it will require a restructuring of transactions so the ones already in the mempool will be the exact same and so they will need to be processed just as they are now.
Also, long term a solution beyond Segwit will need to exist to scale Bitcoin globally to handle enough TPS to meet demand. This may be accomplished with other scaling techniques and/or sidechains offered by third parties that help offload some of the day to day transactions and use Bitcoin to resolve the remaining balances every once in a while. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:45:47
It's how the transaction is generated. It's a slightly different format when Segwit is involved
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:42:46
If you want to use it, I have set up a stats page similar to NiceHAsh but auto-updates without having to refrehs the page.
you can look into my posts to find how to use all of it, but the basics are nhtracker.com/index.html?addr=[PLACE ADDRESS HERE]

@_date: 2017-08-17 20:37:22
I mean, its partially so. 
Segwit2x includes a block size increase. 
If you ask some folks here, we will not get 2x, if you ask others, we will have 2x. I am not here to tell either side they are right, I've made my own financial choices already and sticking to them.

Sounded like the theme to the last few seasons of Red vs Blue
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:14:23
Segwit is a way of organizing and signing the BTC transaction. It only became active on BTC yesterday so lots of new stuff.
Again, i really don't know but if you were to do three transactions it would be the only way to reduce fees unless you simply used a different crypto with lower transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:35:42
It's BCH and you have a point about it being truer to the original concept.
Lightning Network has some things to bring to the table but indeed it has its issues. I think the main issue is it's a solution offered by a corporation. A hub would have to be running proprietary software and license that side chain solution (or could be charged) so this isn't a good thing for Bitcoin. It should only cost the price of storing the data and electricity and hash power. Any other costs to run a hub or node seems outrageous.
Also, Lightning is not the only side chain solution. I think another is called Metal. Or was it Liquid? I never can keep track but basically, if sidechains are the way of the future then we will need these solutions to be compatible with each other or we may never reach critical mass to garner the support and user base that it truly is meaningful to use.

Would be better trying to get it to be a noobs install, this way it's easy to get someone to download it for themselves and trust the version of the chain they have is accurate and not hostile/changed
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:47:47
My contention with this article is it seems like they mention the 2x part at the end but also say earlier in the article that Segwit increases the block size. Is that true? Or is it just more transaction density per block?
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:52:22
Yes but BlockStream just happens to do things a bit more overtly than others I guess. I still am wary of everything even Bitcoin but I will look through source code when it actually launches to make up my mind. Fact is we do need some type of side chain for institutions that don't want all the bitcoin benefits because they have a business model that doesn't lend itself to it. Having other solutions as a part of Bitcoin does make it available for more implementations across different businesses/business types.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:04:52
just noticed, this says 1 of 2....maybe the person was smart enough to separate part of the private keys?
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:57:33
1. Revise the source code of node and mining software to adjust difficulty and cause a hard fork only you know about and can mine.
3. Profit!
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:04:30
I'm much more in support of halving rewards and block times versus two times size if the scaling really is what's needed. 
Form a technical standpoint if we can purge historical data and run a partial node then we wouldn't be increasing the amount of data per block and the demand for as high speed a connection to get big blocks would be avoided.
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:06:17
Please elaborate. You say that core never has supported any non-consensus soft or hard fork but aren't we seeing 92% consensus on NYA? What you're saying does not add up. Why would an agreement that way more than majority is signaling consensus for be invalid anyways?
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:26:48
anything that is not using Bitcoin on the main chain all the time is som sort of side-chain or 2nd layer solution. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:21:00
yes, bring it on!
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:34:52
I honestly don't like the agreement but the fact is if we are not going to do all of it we should have not done any of it and continued discussions

You mean you don't go to your birth hospital and have them print another one out every time you need your birth certificate? I must be doing it wrong.

The thing is, people that believe in Bitcoin want to see that the plans put in place are gone through with. It may not seem as needed with the BCC fork to increase the block sizes but if thats going to change, a proper discussion using the proper channels should be arranged and decided on. It was agreed upon before for Segwit2x and since the community is signaling for it, it should come to fruition or be stopped as a global discussion/plan. Just saying, oh we have segwit now, lets ignore the other half of the agreement does not make outsiders trust Bitcoin like they should and these moves only serve to alienate people that are wanting to buy into the original basis that Bitcoin was founded on.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:55:59
agreed, public shaming was the only way they would have done what they did. I was interested in a Trezor before but considering other options now. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:04:45
Use segwit, 75% discount I believe. Or convert to other crypto and move it that way. Much faster too.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:32:26
Totally click bait but I'll take a look. I'm new around here
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:49:15
I feel ya man, I made a similar argument earlier and it's like talking to a wall. Why is this issue coming up during a period BCH hasn't had any EDA kick in? Why not when it forked?
Really, it seems funny that this is considered an issue when it is a mechanism put in place that has certain rules to it for when it kicks in and so far has shown that it at least worked without a hard fork reduction in difficulty for the BCHers. 
I for one encourage the exploration of different solutions to a problem. I am a software developer and it's common practice in large organizations to sometimes put two teams on the same issue with different approaches to see which one is best.
In the end, we may find all coins are better for the experimentation.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:35:24
I am alluding to that. The block size does seem to pose a significant limitation that does not need to exist but this is the current path of BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:06:29
Yes, it very well could, it be interesting times
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:22:09
I sell using NiceHash, it basically pays out in BTC, so I do not need to think about what altcoins to mine and set up addresses to receive the funds. I just get BTC frequently. 
Its been nice, I've made a nice bit of spare scratch, but it has definitely slowed down a bit.
Let me know if you decide to use it, I can point you to my posts on r/Nicehash about the site I built to automatically refresh the data on page so you can monitor your mining stats while at work on on your phone, without having to constantly refresh manually.
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:42:16
This is true, very good additions. I was writing this on my phone so I didn't review it much before posting. I think you're right though, it's all about what happens in the next several years
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:44:55
so why support any part of it is what I was trying to say. If we do not agree to the compromise, why implement any part of it until we feel that we are actually headed in the direction that the majority agrees on?
If the community does not agree enough to compromise then some supporters are on the side of 2x and some on segwit. By saying they will only support half of a compromise they are piggy backing a plan not everyone supports to get the plan that they supported but wouldn't have gone through without the belief both sides would get what they wanted.
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:07:18
I foresee every release until they give in extending this at least 1 month. It will be the monthly post linking to the github commit that goes straight to the front page every time.

@_date: 2017-08-16 11:33:30
I am not saying you're wrong just we're not getting the full picture from this screenshot. I work in software development and it's way more complicated than this.
If you think Github is the end all be all of discussion even for open source projects you're just so misinformed. 
And again, this screenshot does not show if people are developing on their own forks or making pull requests that are being discussed. It only shows what's the latest thing to be merged into the main branches of the project. That a bet isolated and incomplete view.
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:42:49
Isnt Bitcoin ABC the Bitcoin Cash node devs?

So you know how to use Stack Overflow too I see. :-D
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:09:47
Are you adding up the block size and the segwit data?
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:46:37
this is true, but I also contribute quite a lot. Stack overflow is great for figuring out the source of problems other people have already taken the time to research. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:07:57
Segwit has not even activated and this does not indicate which repository has forks that has tons of work not yet ready to be merged into the main branch. Your screenshot is a complete set of nonsense. 
I work as a software developer and you know what gets people fired real quick? Massive changes to hardened code without proper testing or need. Bitcoin/bitcoin is apparently not implementing 2x so what do they really have to change?
Your screenshot is just plain farce. Bitcoin/bitcoin may have the newest changes applied but it does not give the appropriate picture that is needed to make any statement about which is the real Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:42:12
Segwit is not without its flaws but it is a solution to the transaction malleability flaw and also provides a bit more throughput on the chain. 
Fixing Transaction malleability means that side chain services or Layer 2 services can actually move forward. This will allow for small transactions to occur with only final rectifying transactions hitting the main bitcoin chain so it reduces the load on the main chain while allowing people to securely transact with each other.
This may be a gross oversimplification but hey, now you kinda understand what it's all about.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:47:42
No problem, it's pretty confusing these days with if you're not paying attention constantly
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:30:14
I also shared this sentiment without knowing all those links and stuff. Its deceptive to think Github is the end all be all of active development work. Work happens offline, it happens on IRC clients, it happens on other version controlling software/sites. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:07:59
The conversion rate for bitcoin to Fiat is refreshed in the background every 5 minutes. And if you hover over some of the fields it gives you more info, like the payments tell you the Fiat conversion, the profitability section shows the average, high and low rates they give.

Well, it's been a long time coming (cue to prepare curtains)
Bitcoin is already great again, it's called Bitcoin Cash!
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:46:12
I think Coinbase respond on other subs to support requests. It's the fastest way to get things done (blast them on social media for support).
Otherwise, maybe you can get bitcoin at a lesser deal through localbitcoins, or purse. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:25:58
Not that I'm aware of but can someone monitor for a huge transaction involving a ton of BTC from just a few inputs?
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:13:56
I built a little website to help monitor a little better than their webpage does, but yes, it can bring in a few millibitcoin a week. It has definitely decreased over time but thats expected. Still nice to get more bitcoin than your electricity bill increase would have bought you.
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:23:57
Yep and compiled easily by anyone that has the determination to do so
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:23:53
not taking a side but pointing out an issue. Wouldnt denying someone else from taking control mean you're taking control? Shouldn't you let whoever wants to fork do so and when they fail and come back they will have proven out that the main chain is superior the way it is. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:52:29
this is a much better payoff than the "Mom found a hard drive" story.
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:45:45
definitely looking that way. though, if I came into that type of money, maybe it would be best not to announce it to the world.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:34:33
Thats beyond Nicehash, but I use Coinbase to sell my coin for fiat most of the time, or I use it directly through Purse.io or retailers that take Bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:43:13
So news around China banning Bitcoin seems to be blown out of proportion. I think they closed an unlicensed exchange finally and it got taken the wrong way. Might be completely wrong though.

Interesting thought. 
It seems like a lot of coordination to handle that suddenly stopped when the fork happened August 1st. Why would they stop? Its gone up a huge amount since the fork and you're saying the spam stopped, but why? Even if those people supported the fork, they would be making money by continuing to do the same for both chains, no?

Not taking sides but I did read that the code will be basically the same as the beta channel and arrive shortly. 
As a software dev if it were not in beta I would be very concerned. Sometimes a merge to a different branch can take time and regression testing and they might have simply hit an unintentional snag in getting the code up. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:50:45
Why is August that point?
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:34:47
As a dev, I know that's just going to turn into something like this:
    if(testsAreGoingToFail) {
        // Return that they pass so people stop bitchin
        return true;
    }
