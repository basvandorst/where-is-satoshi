Bitcoin is all you need sir. And lol at "not gonna say I understand 100% but im gonna make my own arltcoin sp as not to rely on any other devs."
I love you guy but come on. You would be doing precisely that buy copying the bitcoin API and tweaking ir to your specs.  To do so, whether in part or carbon copy - you are proving the basic theorem correct - 
**Bitcoin is All you need**

I just emailed him back and forth randomly about a week or two before "this" "happened."
He also as a blog post about how he, in these certain terms, was estimating the death of bitcoin possible, and the ability for it's community to recover 5-10 years.
No. No. No one who says that, after being the smoking gun, is a winner. There's no Fway.

I am happy to inform all of you that this meta data extension of the bitcoin blockchain is VERY much existent as of this writing. 
Smart contracts enable multiple parties to accomplish many things; mastercoin certainly facilitates the sale of goods tied to the blockchain.
There are other solutions that can be implemented as well involving a bit of technical know how visavi the block chain.

If you're in the CT or NY area and need a Bitcoin lawyer with over 35 years experience jewing others for you;
   
NOW ACCEPTING BITCOIN FOR DISCOUNT
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:30:01
I'm merely suggesting the notion, I don't endorse mastercoin zealously. 
Mastercoin is special in that that it is not an altcoin, nor even bitcoin, but in fact an advanced, distinctly different protocol that accomplishes two noble feats;
 It addresses and assuages reasonably well the inevitability blockchain bloat.
 
It builds out the bitcoin protocol in a rich, and highly functional capacity that simultaneously grows the bitcoin protocol by shrinking the meta data load. Loads that miners would otherwise have no extra reward to shoulder!
This is not just another alt - crypto - de - facto - crapstain that seeks to make champion of it's 2.0 modding of BTC. That is retarded and the creation, proliferation and misuse of the myriad xyzcoins bites the hand that allows it to breathe. Beneath the world of crypto rests bitcoin atlas, and only on these capable shoulders does a secure, now invincible public ledger exist. Bitcoins, the currency, is really just one of a great many utilities initially conceived being part and parcel of the wide espousal of the blockchain.
**So yeah, you can sell your artz.**
In these respects, and the fact that the project was created and funded by the likes of Vtalik B. and the BitAngels respectively, make it a sure bet as far as I can see.

I'm going to let everyone here in on a well known secret life/ATM/XP hack.
April 8th, 2014 (yes, that's just three weeks from the time of this writing) 95% of All ATMs, globally, will be vulnerable to hackers. 
To many, this is not bitcoin news, nor is it newsworthy at all. However, considering the burgeoning trend of BTM's sweeping the global scene, one might instantly intuit that this predicates one of the most awesome holidays we may ever see.
I may personally hack an ATM just to celebrate. To be fair, I would do so  by taking out a large line of credit from a long standing bank whom would entrust me $20,000 or so of their hard printed cash to squander.
