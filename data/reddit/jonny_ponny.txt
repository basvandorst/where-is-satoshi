If bitcoin keeps rising i will get 90 inch pitch black �� 
Currently i only have a 55 inch blackish ��
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:24:53
Why would they? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:28:34
I think that we can agree that the surge to 19k was a bubble that has already burst, så it looking like a bubble would be correct. The question is, is this the bottom of it? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:48:29
This is bad for both kinds of bitcoin....
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:32:41
Still does not beat the level of black an oled can show ☺

You want to cover his coment in palladium?
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:26:25
And all of them decided to do the smart thing and have it in their own wallet instead of having it on an exchange ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:35:07
Sweating already? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:33:53
Now tge questin is, where is bottom? 9k? 8k? 7k? 6k? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:36:25
But people keep saying bitcoin isnt money, so you can import by sending btc out of the country? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:24:11
Sorry but the british pound is no longer tied to the gold standard, sp your statement is wrong
 
Also i am not the best person to describe bitcoin easily for you oyher than "internett money/gold" 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:35:40
Qr codes? Its a thing in most wallets ��
Edit: maybe not most, but most of what ive tried ��

There are no girls on the internett, just pretenders ��   
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:10:13
Still up 1000% in a year though, 
Knock on wood
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:13:38
Yes, thats what hodling is about ��
With high risk come great rewards, will probably never sell all my btc though. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:20:09
And then they made an account for you anyway, without telling you. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:58:07
Well if no one knows about your forks, or trades it it doesnt matter, because it is worthless
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:35:46
Thats what she said

@_date: 2018-01-05 21:07:25
Whats up with korea 
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:34:07
You are thinking like evrybody else "ill buy when it dips" (bitcoi  dips) "nah its dropping, im not buying now" 
Just buy and hold, now might not be the best time in the clming weeks, but i believe it is a good time nevertheless. You gotta be real lucky to hit absolute bottom of a dip.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:36:18

What do you mean too fast? Bitcoin has been sideway for atleast 2 days

As long as it doesnt implode, im good 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:55:55
a computer game is also not a physical object, still holds value doesnt it? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:22
Np, got mine easily using coinomi since i had moved all my funds to ledger nano after both forks. 
But i think the hardware wallets can split them for you without you having to move them. Not sure though ��
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:47:11
For every 10k coins you get two pizzas 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:48:15
Yes, ezactly, evrywhere in the world does not have a "safe an stable banking system" to them cryto truly holds value. Even if it volatile like hell. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:31:13
This is rising way too fast 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:13:30
What do you mean? Korea is ar 20.2k

Technically, orbit is constant free fall
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:46:53
Only if bitcoin doesn't get divisible til smaller units than satoshi. Which i guess it will if it is still a thing in 120 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:14:17
Half on btc rest spread
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:37:46

@_date: 2017-12-09 13:11:21
Good luck, �� its a bumpy ride. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:44:16

I  will check it out, thank you ��
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:57:46
Meaning daily volume beeing traded is 500 times (ish) 28mill.

@_date: 2017-12-07 00:57:45
Europe is bullish 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:33:39
Nah �� but i like them since they use segwit �� which is positive for the network. Adoption will not cpntinue at this rate is fees are not lowered ��
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:37:33
know of any exchanges available for europeans that does suppert segwit? except kraken ?
 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:37:27
BTG fork happened in november i think, bch 1.aug, if your btc was at coinbase 1.aug you will get yours from coinbase when they release them ��
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:12:54
what do you mean? most cryptos are in the red? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:11:14
28 mill is peanuts 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:29:16
Because paying an accountant to look at a 5000$ gain probable is going to cost you more than you earn? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:14:31
Well yes, bitcoin looks like a bubble, and probably is a bubble, but then again it is trending, and a shitton of new buyers wants to buy in. Just look at how fast this sub is growing. 
Anyways bitcoin is super high risk/reward so be prepared to lose evrything. 
Edit: also my point is, an article that states the bubble burst when it went from 11k to 9k is maybe not the best source on bubbles? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:39:49
I did, i went into my exam when it was 14k 
 When i was done my friends were freaking out over it beeing 19k, most of us have bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:11:30
20k by 2018
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:46:26
Well, the banks are corrupt an possibly insolvent, and mail is kinda sketchy, so if they have interenett, i think crypto is the way to go. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:57:38
But why is it rising? Any reason or just people that want to join in on the profits? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:42
Yes we might be in a bubble, it migh pop in 10 mins, or it might pop at $100k or $1million 
Or never, no one knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:58:36
well TIL, :) 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:14:42
Thhere is alot of meme support at 9k 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:10:26
i remember when this meme was used for $100, checkpoints, way back, seems like a lifetime ago in cryptotime
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:58
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:22:49
That volume counter is going FAST
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:29
14 fucking thousand! DAHAMN!!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:01:32
Thats bullish, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:14:43
I would strongly recomend you to move btc to another adress first. 
Then download coinomi for android 
Make bch and btg wallets in coinomi 
Find your private key where your btg and bch are 
Enter your btg/bch wallet in coinomi (one at a time) 
Find the action "sweep wallet" 
Scan or enter private key to where your bch/btg are 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:51:11
What does that mean exactly? That i can  make a deal buy bitcoin in jan at 18k? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:10:59
i dont see the power issue as much of an issue, first of all most miners are located where power is cheap, (high degree of renewables) 
2.if the miners are placed in a cold country, they could be used for heating, i know there are som epeople doing this here in norway, where they heat office buildings, this electricity would otherwised be used in electrical heating owens, wich is the most common way to heat houses here (we have cheap electricity due to a shitton of hydropower) 
3.if the miners are not placed somewhere with clean and cheap energy, they would most likely be uneconomical. and diseapper in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:02:11
RemindMe! 3years "elon with us at mars yet?" 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:44:44
For occasions like this, cc is ok 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:36:03
I understood it as he had moved his funds from coinbase to HW, prior to 1. Aug. If so he should have acces to the forked coins. If not, he will get bch from coinbase, if he had btc at coinbase 1.aug
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:43:54
they bought in at something that went up 150% in a day and are pissed it went down? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:28
Its live now? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:05:03
If the definition of a bubble popping is a 40% droo, the bubble has already popped, several times, this year.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:11:49
No, what i was trying to say, those that uses fossil fuels, and are beeing inefficient with their energy consumption. Will lose in competition with people that use the extra spare heat, and also have cheap energy. 
Also since consumption of renewable energy isnt really a problem, i dont think the energy consumption is that big of a deal. 
The energy consumption of bitcoin have become an easy tafget since its easy to calculate, and most people don't see the value in it. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:05:34
no you need to hold your own keys to be sure to get airdrops (forks)
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:08:04
As we say in norway, you have been out a winternight before, you've got this! ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:23:18
$10 worth of grumpyness 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:36:12
They will never buy in. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:16:33
How would i go about doing that? �� seems like alot of work for a $1 buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:32:40
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:58:27
Obviously a bubble, amirite? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:19:30
Why dont you put your money where your mouth is? Short it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:32:07
You would think they would do it across several markets, so the wall wouldnt just be arbitraged away, 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:13:50
Youve obviously never been to a 3.rd world market. You can buy evrything with evrything. 
And if thats not the case, you could exchange it for dollars. Which also is better than local currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:41:54
i would be fine with it increasing 5% every week, 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:41:42
Million dollar question right there, why not go 50/50?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:04:37
"People on the internet said it would happen" 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:53:37
On cb its 4% 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:51:31
But what are the prospects for most millenials over there? In norway you are well of whatever you do as lobg as you have a job. But i know that is unusuall, but say you take a une/college dehree in engineering/medisin/law/economics. You should be set right? And evryone is able to get such an education? If they are willing to work for it? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:11:00
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:48:00
Well obviously invest, and dont tell him about it, so next time he says " neither you nor i invested back then" you can say "but i did" 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:28:07
Sell on 9th and buy back higher, or lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:51:38
Evrybody is trying to hack you, but bitcoin is not a way to do so ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:15:26
Also if you bother to search google, there are more detailed guides
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:23:26
Both of you will be verified sooner or later ��
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:08:27
I meant that ass of know, it can still turn and go below 10k. I dont think it will, and i dont hope it will, but it is a possibility
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:48:37
Just do it, and keep it till youre 18. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:23:36
no, there are alot of transactions during rallies like these, just be patient, or pay more fees
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:31:32
Mainstream news....
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:42:43
there is so much dip, i need more chips
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:03:46
Dude, your first article states the bitcoin bubble already burst.....
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:58:41
I sold mine through changelly for bitcoin in the coinomi wallet, so i guess you could do that, just the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:17:57
Dude, cant you take a joke? And also the dip could not have ended. So he has a point. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:55:06
this is not the future, this is now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:50:39
I dont see how "i told you so" is an opinion or even inviting to an discussion. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:43:31
Yep, my point is that alot of people have been waiting for "THE DIP" to buy in since the price was 2k. So by staying out you migh lose bigtime, as people on here say, if you plan to hold long, just dca, and be aware that there is a non zero chance of losing evrything you invest��
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:19:24
people have been saying a significant drop will  happen in the near future for half a year
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:11
Im happy because it has been growing like crazy, but also a little bit worried. 
Still hodling on though 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:57:53
Haha, probably ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:47:35
Its a bit of both, i have a target for selling out a portion to diversify into stocks�� 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:42:49
When did you buy in? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:00:51
Yep, just check coinmarketcap ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:17:05
missed that, have an exam tomorow so, cant watch evrything, however practicing is getting harder
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:45:52
Youve been waiting through 3 dips already, just buy before this one recovers. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:16:06
Now forget about it, and celebrate xmas
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:23:42
Like the dip that happened at round number 13k ? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:45:32
No need to be a dick about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:42:27

@_date: 2017-12-24 16:03:09
Because they are the ones panicking, ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:37:18
Start using segwit, and recomend exchanges that use segwit to people. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:50:38
Where do you get this fact? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:33:31
Well atleast korea is bullish ��
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:02:44
Right, if you are sendeing $20k i dont think you would mind 50$ to get it through fast 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:55:16
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:52:30
use bitstamp :) they have segwit
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:07:09
Not to shit on you parade here, but both eth and ltc would have the same issues as bitcoin if it had the same amount of users. The fee problem has to be solved. Bitcoin devs are working on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:31:10
Pay more fees 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:04:26
Just read about a norwgian firm that wants to mine bitcoin and use the excess heat to heat buildings, 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:54:19
Heres some investment advise, you are reliable for your own decisions. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:35:11
Its the best way to make a fast transaction when volume 4Xs in 2 days. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:13:52
Evrything that raises 150% in a day is gonna have a correction. The question is will it dropp further or not? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:12:34
What is bitMEX and why does it suddenly have 15% of the volume? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:33:22
Why would you buy bcash? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:17:51
electrum is a good ~~offline~~ private wallet :) however if you have larger amounts, i would suggest you buy a hardware wallet like ledger nano
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:00:03
If that happens, i can buy my own spaceship, bot just a lambo 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:53:25
Slow and steady wins the race 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:20:53
What are they at? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:20:09
Didnt know they hadn't made a new currency, but thx for clearing that up, crypto is still the way to go over there though. But btc needs to fix the fee issue ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:56:01
Yeah right, going to the moon for a meeting is poor financial planing when you can just meet at a cafe or something.

No, they are waiting to get verified by coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:51:35
Yes, but i thinl there were some forks even earlier than that too? After bch itsreally only been btg that you can claim
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:57:44
I thought coinbase and gdax was the same?

Went from 5k to 3k in august 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:04:56
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:25:32
If funds were moved to hardware wallet before 1.aug you should already have those bch, search for guides for how ro get them according to your wallet, 
Also, you have BTG same deal 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:52:46
I would buy, actually i just did ��
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:36:33
Look now. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:17:50
Do you have any chips to go with that dip? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:04:54
I bought at under 3k, so i am good with that, but i would prefer it didnt.

Dude, evryone not selling thinks there is more potential, but no one really knows. Why not put in a small amount? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:51:30
Are you shure about that? If i were a vendor an could chose between btc and a local currency that drops 10% a day, i would have gone with btc

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:18:51
It might maybe possibly happend. 
Just buy 50/50 now and if it happens 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:32:36
Well either way, what if half of all bitcoin is lost? What if noeone wants to sell so only a few bitcoin is available to be bought? The price migt still go above 3 mill, im not saying it is likely, but 3 mill is no upper limit. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:11:56
All the coins will never be mined, it halves every four year or so, thus its a konvergent row, meaning it will close in on 21 mill, but never actually be 21mill 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:13:27
5% drop and people are freaking out, 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:46:04

Well, unless he is actively trying to avoid taxes illegally, they should be able to help right? Their equivalent here in norway does. With the added bonus that if you do anything wrong and get taken to court for tax evation, you could say, i tried to pay my taxes, i called them, and they said i should do x.

Also this sub is mental, if you are looking for more realistic people try bitcoinmarkets.

@_date: 2017-12-18 02:14:12
I would go for something like 12k if entering now, its been a long time since a 30-40% drop but still, thats kinda normal with bitcoin ��

What news?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:47:30
I would atleast put some of it in, i think we will break through previous high soon and then have a surge.

@_date: 2017-12-09 13:09:27
Because there is no upper limit to how expensive something can be. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:39:42
so what would fix the problems then ? 4x blocksize? 8x? 16x? 32x? the chain gets really big really fast after that
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:26:25
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:50:43
well then we agree, but i think the fee problem will be solved eventually. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:04:12
If the price is stable (which it rarely is) you could get away with no fees if you do a bank transfer. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:48:30
I would recommend it, so yes its recommended ��

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:45

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:00:19

I also predicted the drop based on what happened after last fork. I dont see any reason for it to dump again before 10k,10k  is only 30% ish increase
