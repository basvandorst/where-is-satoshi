WOW!! so after back tracking I just remembered that I was watching a video on how to deposit on to poloniex (Which I didn't even fucking have to I already knew how) and as it turns out I took a picture of the guy's QR code in the video as I was switching over tabs to my polo....!!! WTF!! I managed to track down the guys youtube and dropped him a polite comment explaining what happened but who's going to just give $500 back to a stranger. Thinking on the optimistic side, at least it was only $500 I mean I've heard some terrible horror stories...smh

When you say get your coins out of exchanges are you referring to atlcoins and bitcoinx or just bitcoins?

So now I finally got an email back from them basically saying i sent it to the wrong address...Im not sure how that happened because I scanned the QR code, but is there any way that I can get get that btc in my account still? I mean I still sent them the coins its just in the wrong place. Talk to me guys

dont the deposit addresses aways change tho?

well i took a picture of the qr code, i never entered the code manually  but I am 99% sure i sent it to the correct address. I also see my hash id in the bitcoin address and it shows up green but still nothing in my poloniex transaction activity. This has to be an issue on the poloniex side, how do I track down poloniex on here?

Yeah the hash id is in the address but its still not showing up. How can I track down support on here? I've had a ticket open for 36hrs no response:(

apparently i sent the btc to an address that wasnt for me. idk how that happened but is there anyway i can still get what i purchased?
