I would rather see a blocksize increase happen within the next few months. Segwit is nice but adoption may take a while which means we won't see an increase in capacity until probably 2017 (since it only starts to activate at 75% adoption). With the Halvening looming over miners, I suspect they'd want as much transactions as possible within a block in order to get more fees.
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:38:51
I don't see how this related to anonymity. This would have let pools block mining rewards for other pools if they had enough votes. Unless I'm missing something, nothing here seems to support the statement that Mike Hearn saw anonymity as a problem.
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:24:34
Because it limits innovation and stifles demand. If you want bitcoin to become mainstream and used by people all over the world daily then bitcoin has a scalability problem. If you want bitcoin to remain as is then you don't have a scalability problem.
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:13:24


Is there any evidence for this statement? From what I've heard, Brian Armstrong and Mike Hearn think the lack of agreement on the blocksize limit is what's holding Bitcoin back. I haven't heard anything about them arguing against anonymity features. Does anyone have any evidence to the contrary?
EDIT: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted. For example, [here is a story]( about Mike Hearn working on routing bitcoin transactions through Tor to prevent de-anonymization by IP tracking.
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:56:06
Pools are not anonymous. Each block mined is associated with a specific pool. You can check this here: [ Bitcoin usage, on the other hand, is close to anonymous.
As for the so-called "blacklist" post, you linked to, it's a suggestion to highlight possibly criminal transactions. The transactions themselves are already public. This does not deanonymize the user. Mind you, I don't agree with this suggestion as the question of what is and what is not criminal is ambiguous. And anyone who wants to track transactions can easily do so anyway since the blockchain is a record of every single bitcoin transaction ever made.
None of this also backs up the original claim that Hearn stated that Bitcoin anonymity is what's preventing mainstream adoption. I'm sure, based on what you've linked to, that you can agree with that.

This is not spam. Everytime there's a bitcoin price rally, the mempool gets backed up. Why? Because in order for there to be a price rally, Bitcoin needs to be traded. That means more transactions, and more transactions = backlog.

The fee makes sense though. Rule of thumb for manual fee calculation is go to bitcoinfees.21.co and pay double the recommended fee in order to get the transaction processed right away. The recommended fee is currently 180sat/byte and this transaction is paying ~360sat/byte.
Could be such weird transactions (tons of inputs to one output) happen often but we don't see them because we don't look for them on days when transaction fees are lower. I could be wrong though.

That won't happen. Or, more accurately, as soon as BIP148 starts blocking non-Segwit blocks, it will fork off the main chain. Unless there's a miner that only mines BIP148 blocks (and only on top of other BIP148 blocks) then the BIP148 nodes will fail to get any new blocks. If there *is* a miner that's mining only BIP148 blocks then *all* the blocks will show up as signalling for SegWit. At that point, BIP148 nodes will start accepting non-SegWit blocks but, since they've forked off the main chain, they won't be seeing any. They'll only be following the BIP148 chain.

This is wrong. Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed. There are no chargebacks. Double-spends are not chargebacks. Bitcoin does not have instant verification. You have to wait at least 10 minutes for the transaction to be confirmed unless you, as the vendor, are ok with 0-conf transactions (usually for POS operations).

Changing the activation mechanism changes everything. Since the only mechanism for activation is the flag day, this ensures a chain split since you end up with two networks - one mining SegWit blocks and one mining regular blocks. Unless the UASF has a large majority of hashpower behind it, it will always end up with a chain that has less proof of work behind it than the non-UASF chain. Thus, it's not backwards compatible because it causes old nodes/clients to follow one chain while UASF nodes/clients follow another chain.

I believe SegWit will give a 60% improvement *at most*. And that's if most clients, nodes, and wallets are using it. I'm really curious as to how the soft fork will go down on the miner side since, from what I can gather, it will increase the rate of orphaned blocks for any miners who haven't upgraded. It looks like it might be the equivalent of a hard fork on the miner side but I can be wrong. It's been very hard to find any detailed info on what impact the soft fork will have on miners. Of course, may be I've been looking in the wrong places.
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:47:53
Good point. I'm wondering won't a soft fork break validation on non-upgraded nodes?
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:39:46
It's 2. The basic SegWit details have been around for a while and were widely known. However, implementing a HF after SegWit is a lot harder and SegWit does not automatically give a ~1.7x capacity boost - it only does so if every transaction in the block is a SegWit transaction. A HF will need to be done in the future anyway (Lightning Network needs space for channel closing and opening) but pushing the HF to sometime in the far future is seen as a big risk since, if anything goes wrong, a lot more people will be affected. So some miners see a HF followed by SW as a lot cleaner.
Of course there's another side that argues that Lightning Network transactions will completely kill bitcoin transaction fees, driving the miners out of business and sevely impacting the security of the network. For miners acting for the long term best, this would mean not signalling for SW (but also not signalling for BU).

True and that's what I mean. Currently, there is a range of transaction fees (may be I should say transaction ratios instead). If, however, all wallets started to include the recommended fee then wouldn't prioritization stop unless users started paying above the recommended fee?

Because once the transaction is confirmed it stays confirmed. The money is now in the vendor's account and is free to be used. It cannot, suddenly, be taken back by the buyer. That's the entire point of the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:09:29
I think you misunderstand how transaction fees work. They're not based on the amount of currency transferred. They're based on the actual size of the transaction in bytes. A 25 cent fee for a $32,000 transaction, provided the transaction is somewhere around 258 bytes, should be more than enough to get it confirmed in the next block (unless you're really unlucky).

SegWit does not offer 3.7MB. It offers, at best, 1.7MB unless a block is filled with tons of multisig transactions.

Check your source. It says:


So that's ~1.6MB for a block filled with P2PKH transactions, and all those would have to be Segwit transactions. If those transactions are multisig, you have more space (since the sig data is segregated).

As for the "attack vector" I mentioned, you need to check the next paragraph in that post which states:

No one's talking about removing the blocksize limit. BU, for example, allows miners to change the limit when needed (either higher or lower). 
That said, you dont need a blocksize limit to create a fee market. Miners can simply refuse to include transactions that have a fee that's too low. Full blocks, however, open up an attack vector where a miner can create high fee transactions to include in their own block (possibly at no cost to them) in order to game the various fee estimate mechanism built into wallets. There was some speculation on this subreddit that this may already be the case.

Even at 60% it's very likely to cause a chainsplit since the miners will be signalling for SegWit and not UASF. The nuance is this - miners that mine SegWit blocks are backwards compatible with non-SegWit blocks. So, if a non-SegWit signalling block is mined after a SegWit block, SegWit miners will have no problem with it and will mine on top of it. But BIP148 nodes will reject that chain since they don't consider the non-SegWit block to be valid.

Not sure which groups "threaten with a fork before consensus". If you're talking about Classic, there needs to be a 75% consensus and then the HF does not kick in until a month later. Remember, there was a lot of people asking Core for a blocksize increase for over a year but no code was suggested even as a contingency measure. The HK meeting set a July deadline for Core's blocksize increase Hard Fork code. It's surprising that, instead, we're seeing suggestions fof a June hard fork that will adjust difficulty and may, in fact, make actual malicious hard forks (which Classic is not) able to survive.

Not all of those are pools but, yes, a lot of the miners are ok with a larger block size. The problem is they want to set a hard limit to the blocksize (i.e. "hit 5MB and then stop"). Remember, Bitcoin was originally designed to scale with technological progress and there was no block size limit. It was implemented by Satoshi as a temporary measure to prevent denial of service attacks (so people won't be able to overload the blockchain with spammy transactions). Unfortunately, for the most part, increasing the blocksize requires a fork (as far as I can recall) and this is what the core devs don't want. Hence the controversy.

That said, even if that was the case, according to coin.dance, currently AntPool mined 13.19% of the latest blocks, btc.top mined 2.78%, and viabtc mined 4.86%. Added up that equals to only 20.83% of the latest blocks. There are more miners running Core clients that aren't signalling for SegWit than anything Bitmain may be behind.
@_date: 2016-06-06 10:48:05
Isn't it different in this case since the victim is ignoring Segwit blocks and won't know the confirmation block was orphaned?
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:35:55
Because rolling out SegWit as a soft fork requires rewriting a lot of underlying Bitcoin code and is very risky. It also screws up verificatio  for non-upgraded nodes and has no economic incentive to upgrade. Rolling out a blocksize limit increase with a hard fork once there is 75% consensus seems more safer and allows for much more time for SegWit testing. 
There is also difference in philosophy. A lot of Core devs (mainly those allied with Blockstream (represented by Adam Back who is technically not a Core Dev but holds a lot of sway and is mentioned in bitcoin.org and the Hong Kong consensus)) want very little to no on-chain scaling. SegWit is useful because it helps with a lot of Lightning Network functionality (but that's still possibly years away from being finished, tested, and released) but it only allows for a max 1.7x increase.
The other side wants Bitcoin to be able to scale on its own (on chain) while all other alternatives are being developed. This will help with increased demand coming from more people starting to use Bitcoin. Also, having multiple teams working on bitcoin code will prevent developer centralization.
There's more, of course, but that's the gist.

Paying a "stupid amount" for a transaction is a good way to guarantee that the transaction will be included in the next block. If everyone in line pays the recommended fee then no one gets priority. Paying a considerably higher fee, however, results in your transaction being first in line.

Low fee transactions won't cause the fee to rise. The rise in delays is due to an influx of transactions paying a normal fee. That's why the cheapest suggested fee, at the moment, is 90satoshis/byte (source: [
If low-fee transactions were the problem, you'd see a growth in mempool size but the suggested transaction fee would remain the same. Growing transaction fees means the mempool is filling up with higher fee paying transactions.

Segwit2X is going to be the main chain. 90% of the hashpower has been signalling for it for months (including BTCC and BitFury). Step 1 was the SegWit activation with the 2X hardfork set to occur in November. Unless the Core client implements a mining difficulty change, it's unlikely the Segwit-only chain will survive with just 10% hashpower remaining.
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:27:03
Segwit is onchain scaling.
@_date: 2016-12-09 12:29:16


Right. That would be barely 2.5%. SegWit support currently stands under 23%. It has an enormously long way to go before 2.5% of the overall hashrate even begins to make an impact. 
Finally, the requirement for 95% consensus is what makes proposal blocking relatively easy. Many people, including myself, had argued months ago that this increases the risk of a usually-insignificant minority blocking new features.
However, we are no where near that point yet. SegWit signalling isn't anywhere near 50% yet, let alone 90%. Why focus on something that has less than 2.5% of impact instead of focusing on why the *top 3 mining pools* are still not signalling for SegWit? Those have a much bigger impact than Bitcoin.com could hope to have.

The SegWit soft fork itself was contentious as hell and only got pushed through as part of the NYA. Before that, only around 40% of the hashpower has been signalling for it.
Makes me wonder how any scaling solution will be suggested in the future since there's a lot of contention and a lot of vocal folk have decreed that hashpower is not a good measure of consensus.

Because Bitcoin is used by lots of people and companies for transactions. Having a currency that only works sometimes is detrimental to them. That is why in a lot of cases adoption has slowed or even reversed. I think a lot of people underestimated the amount of users who were waiting on SegWit2X to increase capacity. That fell through so the next best thing (short of waiting an unknown period of time for code that needs to be written, reviewed, and tested) was to move to a chain that allows for 8X scaling right away.

Are you telling me there have been no backlogs since the NYA was signed? Because I've got a bridge to sell ya...
When the price jumped the last few times, there have been major backlogs even on weekends. Bitcoin has been operating at capacity for quite a while now.
That said, BCH itself came up against a "spam transaction" attack but it was all cleared out in a block or two. Just a minor blip on the radar. If BTC's scaling solution requires all the parties to trust each other to "play nice" then that scaling solution is bound to fail.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:25:01
Unfortunately they are. SegWit2X signalling has been under 80% lately so there was no way the fork was going to go through anyway. The statement just confirms that. On the other hand, current Bitcoin scaling *is* being controlled by just a handful of people. Think, for example, how much sway and power Adam Back holds when he's not even a developer and whose company holds a gigantic conflict of interest with on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:13:27
There have been numerous backlogged that coincided with huge price swings before the August 1st BCH fork so the missing hashpower doesn't explain it. Instead, the transactions per second increase is the more likely factor.

Most of the time something like a third of the hashpower was signalling for SegWit. Bitmain has a lot of hashpower but nothing like 2/3rds of the total. And when SegWit2X signalling began, it was being signalled by the same miners who were originally signalling for SegWit - BTCC and Bitfury. So that whole "mining cartel" theory doesn't hold up. And, up until F2Pool dropped out, the only mining pool *not* signalling for SegWit2X was SlushPool.

I know it because it deliberately avoids basing activation on hashpower or any other metric. It foregoes all that in favor of a flag day activation. There is no way of knowing the total adoption of it. That's why the focus has shifted away from getting regular users to run it and is more focused on getting "exchanges and economic nodes" to run it. With a hard fork, you'd need to get a large majority of hashpower before anything is set in motion. Even the SegWit soft fork requires an activation period to make sure everyone has time to get on board. BIP148 has none of that.


Considering that Segwit has currently less than 30% of hashpower supporting it after being released for nearly 6 months (not to mention that a pro-SegWit miner (BitClub) has recently stopped signalling support for it), I'd say expecting BIP148 to have less than 50% of hashpower behind it on August 1st is a very good guess. Furthermore, the UA in UASF stands for User Activated not Miner Activated. The whole point of the UASF is to stop using hashpower as an indicator of consensus.


If those people received any money on the BIP148 chain, they will either be forced to forfeit their coins or sell them on an exchange (if any exchange supports that sort of trade and if there's enough hashpower to handle a sudden increase in transactions due to a massive selloff).


Only the exchanges matter, not the users. And I doubt exchanges are willing to cripple their capacity to properly handle bitcoin transactions. If BIP148 becomes very popular, exchanges may decide to offer trading on both chains. Most global users, however, will probably stick to the chain that's faster and more secure. From what I can gather, only one miner is truly compatible with BIP148 at the moment and that's Bitcoin India. Even BitFury, which tends to often signal for BIP148 doesn't do so with every block. Come August 1st, if that continues, BitFury may end up mining on two separate chains.
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:04:24


Your profit stays on the original chain. It does not exist on the BIP148 chain. And, if BIP148 ever gets &gt;50% hashpower behind it, the original chain disappears.
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:59:25
BIP148 does not check hashpower. It simply sets up a flag day for when BIP148 nodes start rejecting non-SegWit signalling blocks. Thus, after August 1st they'll also reject SegWit signalling blocks since those will be built on top of non-SegWit signalling blocks. BIP148 nodes won't reorg. They'll just follow whatever miner(s) that is/are using a BIP148 node.
Honestly, I really think that UASF was either started as a troll or an attack on BTC. The design makes no sense and any economic service that adopts it risks losing a lot of money (simply based on BIP148's design). And for some reason people think that if a majority of nodes run it, they can orphan blocks all they want. That's not how it works though. As long as there's a handful of nodes that accept non-BIP148 blocks, the miners are all good to go and BTC transactions will continue to go through.
Ironically, the same scenario is why SegWit won't have constant reorgs if it ever goes live. There were reorgs on the testnet with SegWit but, iirc, that was caused by a lack of such "bridge nodes". It's an undocumented behavior of SegWit (since SegWit nodes won't accept SegWit blocks from non-SegWit nodes (due to them missing witness data). There was talk about this in March on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:10:20
BIP148 will reject any blocks that do not signal for Segwit after August 1st. By that measure it will also reject any blocks mined on top of those rejected blocks even if the newer blocks signal for SegWit. Non BIP148 Core nodes, on the other hand, will see all those blocks as a valid chain. Thus, you end up with two chains on the flag day (Aug 1st) - one BIP148 and one Core. This will happen even if BIP148 has an economic majority. This is why all previous soft forks first confirmed that there was enough hashpower behind them so as to not cause a chainsplit.

UASF is not for activating SegWit. UASF is for forking the chain on August 1st and then causing a major reorg if the UASF chain ever gets the majority hashpower. Remember, on August 1st, Core nodes become incompatible with BIP148 nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:27:57
UASF is far more dangerous than a hard fork. A worst case scenario in a hard fork is two immutable chains. With a UASF, you get a chainsplit and then, if the UASF chain ever gets &gt;50% of the hashpower, the original Core chain and all transactions on it gets wiped out in a massive reorg.

Here's the definition of a soft fork from [


By that definition, after August 1st, BIP148 is *not* a soft fork since every node that is not a BIP148 node will not consider BIP148 blocks valid. Why? Because as soon as a non-SegWit signaling block is mined, BIP148 nodes reject it but *every other node on the network* considers it valid and considers every block built on top of that block to be valid. However, these very same nodes will see the next BIP148 block to be invalid since it's mined on top of an old block that has already been surpassed.
That said, if BIP148 has &gt;50% of hashing power, it becomes the equivalent of a 51% attack.
@_date: 2016-02-09 12:21:09
Isn't a 100GB sized blockchain just as likely with 1MB blocks (even more so with SegWit)? Avoiding 2MB blocks isn't going to solve the blockchain size issue.

Core nodes become incompatible with BIP148 nodes after August 1st so "overwhelming consensus for Segwit" does not come into play here. Furthermore, previous deletions/bans here were for clients that also required some sort of threshold to be reached before they actually altered the protocol. Going by that standard, BIP148 qualifies as such a client.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:32:28
BIP148 "activates" SegWit by causing a chainsplit in which one the BIP148 chain has nothing but SegWit blocks. It still invalidates non-BIP148 SegWit-compatible nodes and makes anyone running a Core node lose money if they decide to switch to the BIP148 chain after the flag day. Plus there's the looming threat of a reorg which will really screw over the exchanges.
If anything, it would make more sense to have a User Activated Hard Fork. Since a chainsplit is guaranteed either way, at least doing it as a hard fork means that switching to one chain does not result in losing money on the other chain.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:41:39
The economy will likely converge away from the UASF after the flag day. Let's say you run a shop that takes bitcoin and you decide to change your node to a BIP148 node on August 10th. Any payments you've received between August 1st and August 10th will not show up on the BIP148 chain and you'd end up with lost funds.
Furthermore, if you decide not to change your node over to BIP148 and, on November 1st (hypothetical date picked for example) the BIP148 chain gets a majority of hashpower, all payments you've received from August 1st until November 1st will be wiped out.

The purpose of BIP148 is to stop accepting non-SegWit signalling blocks after August 1st. Thus, it will also stop accepting blocks that *do* signal for SegWit since they'll be mined on top of non-SegWit signalling blocks. The only blocks BIP148 nodes will accept are from miners that only follow the BIP148 chain. All other nodes (including all Core Segwit nodes) will continue to follow the Core chain.

Won't transaction fees rise once RBF becomes mass-adopted? After all, if your transaction is currently stuck for a few hours, there is nothing for you to do but wait. You're not going to send a second transaction with a higher fee to the same address, right? You *might* use a higher fee on your *next* transaction but your next transaction might be a day or two away. With RBF, if you're waiting for your transaction to go through, you'll be able to up the fee. That means transaction fees will rise during a slowdown instead of remaining relatively steady since the transaction is currently pending.

You need an overwhelming majority of hashpower for an SF to work. Otherwise you end up with a chainsplit that's followed by a major reorg down the line. It's a lot riskier than a chainsplit caused by a hard fork since there's no chance of a reorg with the latter.

But unless/until a Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork happens BTU will not exist. That said, as long as one holds BTC, one will also end up with BTU during a hard fork. Since Roger Ver is rumored to have a shitload of BTC (I've heard the number 300,000 bandied about) he will also end up with a shitload of BTU after a hard fork. That's how hard forks work.

Core nodes will work fine. BIP148 nodes won't. Core nodes allow both types of blocks - those that signal for SegWit and those that don't. Thus they allow SegWit-signaling blocks that are mined on top of non-SegWit signaling blocks. BIP148 nodes will consider those SegWit-signaling blocks invalid since those nodes consider the block they're mined on top of to be invalid. So Core nodes see one chain and BIP148 nodes fork off since *every* block in their chain needs to signal for SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:13:20
How so? On August 1st, BIP148 nodes will start rejecting all blocks that don't signal for SegWit and, by that measure, they'll reject all blocks mined on top of those blocks (even if these new blocks *do* signal for SegWit). Meanwhile, non-BIP148 Core nodes will consider both types of blocks as valid. They will continue to follow that chain since it's the longest. BIP148 nodes, however, will only follow a chain that's made up of BIP148 blocks. What do I mean by BIP148 blocks? They have to be Segwit signalling blocks that *are always* mined on top of other SegWit-signalling blocks. Thus, on August 1st, a chainsplit will occur.

True and BIP148 will only follow miners that have gone out of their way to be compatible with BIP148. If you need the majority of hashpower to pull this off then the UASF becomes a MAHF.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:43:39
But BIP148 breaks compatibility with ordinary SegWit compatible nodes. It guarantees a chain fork and the only way to guarantee the survivability of the BIP148 chain is to have the majority of hashpower mining on the BIP148 chain. Either way, there's a chain split.

Great point. I think it'll definitely help the transaction fees reflect demand.

Majority of what? The other chain is sure to be longer since it will include blocks that signal for SegWit and blocks that don't. The BIP148 chain will not consider any of those SegWit-signaling to be valid since they're mined on top of non-SegWit-signaling blocks.
Actually, I'm wrong. I think one chain will survive and that's the original chain. BIP148 will fork off and will only accept blocks from BIP148 miners. After 1024 blocks (I think - I'm typing from memory) BIP148 nodes will consider SegWit to be activated and (this is the part I'm not sure about) will see the original chain as being the valid one (since BIP148 will no longer be orphaning non-BIP148 blocks). So this should cause a massive reorg during which time any transactions made using the BIP148 chain will be deleted.

No, the only thing the UASF specifies is a flag date. That said, even if exchange nodes run BIP148 they will hardfork away from all Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited, and other nodes. UASF/BIP148, despite its name, is a hard fork. When it reaches the flag day it will split away from the economic majority. Even if major exchanges, for whatever reason, decide to run BIP148, anyone who uses that exchange will not see their transactions going through since they'll be operating on different chains.
@_date: 2016-02-09 15:05:38
I don't follow. What two things combined? Segwit and 2MB blocks? 2MB blocks are needed to give Bitcoin some breathing room since the blocks are close to maxing out. All the other scaling solutions are pie-in-the-sky at the moment. Things like the Lightning Network and other solutions are still way in the future (if they're technically possible at all). A blocksize bump to 2MB will, in the meantime, help Bitcoin deal with increased use and will buy enough time for either other scaling solutions to develop or for bandwidth/storage to go down in price.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:52:37
But the blocks *are* at maximum capacity. Sure, they're not at maximum capacity 24/7 but they're at maximum capacity when most people want to transact business using bitcoin. And, as the number of daily transactions keeps rising, it will get worse. Hopefully SegWit can help handle some of the pressure.
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:13:17


HF requires all nodes that want to remain on the primary chain to upgrade. SF is normally fine but, in this case, BIP148 is contentious so the only way it's compatible is, if the BIP148 chain ever gets longer than the Core chain, it will cause all the non-BIP148 nodes (which are "backward compatible" to reorg wiping out a few months worth of transactions.
So, in this case, I see an HF as being a safer choice.
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:40:27
Wait. Who do you mean by "minority" in this case? If you mean BIP148 miners, they won't reorg after the majority mines a couple of blocks because their nodes will invalidate any blocks mined on top of non-SegWit signalling blocks. Unless I'm reading your comment wrong, in which case can you clarify?
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:55:41
This portion is incorrect:


Even if BIP148 is supported by the economic majority, it will still result in a chain split after August 1st since Bitcoin Core nodes become incompatible with BIP148 nodes after August 1st.

No, they lose it if they switch. BIP148 causes a chainsplit on August 1st. Thus, any block reward that miner earned will be on the original (Core) chain. If they switch to the BIP148 chain after August 1st, none of the BTC the miner earned will be on the BIP148 chain (since that transaction was never on the BIP148 chain). So switching to BIP148 after the flag day is like burning money.
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:57:06
Slight correction: the blocks are full. Check [ The max blocksize limit is 1,000,000 bytes. The largest blocks I'm seeing are 976.54 kilobytes. 976.54 kilobytes * 1024 (amount of bytes in a kilobyte) = 999,976.96. That's a maxed out block.
@_date: 2017-04-11 02:43:25

So you agree that UASF qualifies as "client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus" then? After all a flag day != overwhelming consensus.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:18:41
But anyone running a regular Core node (as opposed to a BIP148 node) has less incentive to run a UASF node after August 1st since, if UASF gets a majority of hashpower, all nodes that are not BIP148 compatible will suffer a major reorg that will nullify all transactions made on the original chain.
@_date: 2016-09-13 22:38:57

The price was already going down before the Bitfinex hack. The August 1st deadline seems to have been the trigger. Core's philosophy seems to be to limit Bitcoin scaling since, in the view of, at the very least, Greg Maxwell, mass adoption of Bitcoin at this present time is NOT a good thing. We have Segwit coming out but that's really just a malleability fix. Under the best conditions we could see a 1.75x capacity boost but that does open a 4MB block attack vector by a malicious miner.
Anyway, I'm curious what the price action will be once 0.13.1 comes out. That is currently the version that will include the Segwit go-live. Hopefully, we'll see some scaling in the next six months.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:13:33
That's it. First SegWit (which has been activated) then 2x. This is all per the Segwit2X agreement and this is what all mining pools except for Slushpool are signalling for. Anything after that is up in the air.
I don't understand Core's refusal to increase the underlying blocksize. SegWit was never going to make a dent in transaction volume without months of adoption. The blocksize limit increase has been debated about since 2013. There has been plenty of time to release a code base and have miners signal for or against it. Instead we got the crap with posts about BIP101 being removed and a whole lotta political crap. SegWit2X was borne out of people being sick of all that crap.
@_date: 2016-09-13 21:10:50
Blocksize isn't an issue anymore. I think the main concern regarding it is hard forking which Core seems very reluctant to do. At least that's how it looks to me.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:19:47


Yeah, I don't think so.


I'm not going to go into most criticisms of SegWit here. A lot of them were misunderstandings and the like. When I say it was "controversial" I mean that, on average, about a third of hashpower was for it. Far far less than what is needed for proper consensus.
That said, one of the controversial things about it is that, for 1 MB of blocksize you would get up to 4MB of blockweight. This would make future blocksize increase hardforks difficult since they would have to content with an 8MB blockweight. Ironically, this criticism of SegWit is now being used by people like Adam Back as a criticism of SegWit2x.


Not really. A malleability fix is needed for making payment channels easier to develop. The SegWit soft fork was one method. There were/are other methods. For example, SegWit was originally going to be hard fork. There were other proposals too such as the Extension Block proposal which, when it came out, led to Core attacking Lightning Network developers such as Joseph Poon.
Every single scaling proposal aside from SegWit has been attacked, not on technical merits, but through character assassination and censorship.


Yes, and I never said payment channels were bad. A fully functioning payment channel that reduces transaction times while maintaining privacy and decentrilization is a good thing. However, co-opting Bitcoin development and progress to push one's own product (the Liquid sidechain) and attacking devs of competing sidechain tech (such as when Greg Maxwell and the gang went after Joseph Poon ([ is a bad.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:06:25
This is inaccurate. Most of the original devs wanted a base blocksize increase for years now. However, most of the current main Core devs are now tied to a single entity - Blockstream and have pushed forth SegWit as the only scaling solution. They have also antagonized any other developers as well as major bitcoin evangelists, companies, and even Lightning Network devs. This is because Blockstream's main and only product is the Liquid sidechain which becomes completely unnecessary if the Bitcoin network is not stressed.
Furthermore, any major changes to the reference client required a vast majority of hashpower (over 90%) to signal readiness. This is what's happening in this case as the majority of hashpower is signalling for SegWit2X. SegWit2X is also the reason the *very* controversial SegWit proposal was finally pushed through (as opposed to languishing for nearly a year at 30% signalling).

After August 1st BIP148 nodes reject all blocks that dont signal for SegWit. Since they dont accept those blocks they also wont accept blocks mined on top of those non-SegWit signaling blocks. However, all other nodes (including Core nodes) will. This is the reason why BIP148 is guaranteed to cause a chainsplit (unless it has a majority of hashing power behind it which would effectively turn the UASF into a MASF).
Since BIP148 nodes no longer follow the original chain after August 1st, if the main chain adopts SegWit, BIP148 nodes wont see it because, as far as BIP148 nodes are concerned, that entire chain is built off of invalid blocks.

Yes. Your node will reject all blocks including the SegWit signalling blocks as soon as a non-SegWit block is mined. This is because the SegWit blocks will be mined on top of the non-SegWit blocks which your node does not see. Thus your node will reject the whole chain as invalid.
The only miners your node will follow are ones that are mining off of BIP148 blocks. It won't follow SegWit miners and, even if SegWit is activated on the main chain, your node will not see it.

Segwit has to be implemented across the board for it to be able to handle a greater transaction volume. According to Bitcoin Core's site ([ most wallets are not yet ready to handle SegWit. Futhermore, while there is criticism that a 2 MB hardfork will lead to centralization, SegWit allows for a single 1MB block to balloon into 4MB of data which can be a much greater that to decentralization than a 2MB blocksize limit. Both issues can be solved with a hardfork.

What's stopping Bill Gates from doing that is incentive. He has no reason to do that. However, if bitcoin becomes successful there are numerous entities that stand to lose a good amount of business/control. And running a full node is a lot cheaper than running a mining operation since you're simply providing data to miners - you're not doing any of the actual processing.
As for the cost of operating a single bank branch - I don't see how that's relevant here. Bank branches make money. That is how they stay in business. If they lose money then they are shut down. Currently, there is no reward for running a full bitcoin node. Thus, if you have to keep spending money to upgrade and pay for bandwidth then the cost will become more and more prohibitive. This will cause a decrease in full nodes and makes the entire bitcoin network less secure.
EDIT: I should also add that, as far as I know, it is not illegal to hijack control of the blockchain so the risk involved (aside from the expense) is minimal.

If SegWit2x is not activated, every SegWit signalling miner that is running off a Core node will continue to build on top of blocks that are mixed. They won't be consecutive.
It's like this:
* Block A (signals for SegWit)
* Block B (does not signal for SegWit. Mined on top of Block A. Core nodes are fine with this block and accept it. After August 1st, if SegWit2x is not activated, BIP148 nodes reject it.)
* Block C (signals for SegWit. Built on top of Block B. Core nodes accept this block as valid. After August 1st, if SegWit2x is not activated, BIP148 nodes reject it since it's built on Block B which BIP148 nodes consider invalid.)
So, if SegWit2x is not activated by August 1st, BIP148 nodes will fork off the network unless ~50% of hashpower is mining off a BIP148 chain. Without SegWit2x, BIP148 nodes become incompatible with Core nodes come August 1st.

I would disagree. Block size would balloon which would stress processing and memory requirements. Transferring that much data worldwide would stress bandwidth limits (how many nodes have access to a 10GB link?) and as for storage, storage follows Kryder's Law instead of Moore's but the rate has decreased during the past few years.
This is definitely something that can turn into a problem. Assuming that storage, processing, and bandwidth rates will increase forever is very shortsighted. At some point we will hit a limit.

One of the main arguments against the current SegWit Soft Fork is that it makes a future 2MB Hard Fork a lot more difficult. Furthermore, a lot of the UASF supporters see any sort of Hard Fork as being bad for Bitcoin, no matter what.

Wipe-out protection was requested from some groups but, with with over 85% of current hashpower signalling for SegWit2x it's a safe bet the hashpower will be there. That said, the required &gt;1MB block at a specific height makes the hardfork predictable to the block. Wipe-out protection is just the icing on the cake.

This is not good news. FAQs are not legally binding. Statements saying "we won't sue" are not legally binding. Furthermore, the FAQ states:


Patenting something is not making it "accessible to the Patent Office so that it is available as prior art". Patenting something is patenting something. It gives you control over who can utilize the technology until the patent expires. It also opens up a whole legal can of worms if Blockstream ever declares bankruptcy and has to sell off its assets its patents.

The DPL requires asking the licensor for permission to use the license. It centralizes control. Furthermore, this means Core development will be covered under Patent protection. This is a higher risk than the USPTO overlooking prior art. If the USPTO overlooks prior art but the prior art exists then the patent can be disputed. If Blockstream either loses control of its patents or turns into a malicious actor then there is no way to dispute those patents. This is a huge central risk.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:36:16
No, because BIP148 miners will only mine on a chain made up of *consecutive* SegWit signalling blocks. Since there are more miners mining on a chain made up of mixed blocks (aka both blocks that signal for SegWit and blocks that don't), the non-BIP148 chain will be longer. Non-BIP148 nodes will follow the longer chain. BIP148 nodes will reject that chain due to it having non-SegWit signalling blocks.
If the BIP148 chain ever gets more blocks than the Core (mixed) chain, it will wipe out the Core chain and all transactions made on it from August 1st, 2017 onward, unless the Core nodes implement some sort of wipeout protection.

I'm not thinking in terms of consumer electronics. I'm thinking in terms of storage space. Rapid blockchain growth will stress Bitcoin nodes, for example. If the amount of bitcoin nodes drops *and* if only large organizations can run one then this hurts the entire network. For example, what's to stop an entity with enough monetary resources from creating a few thousand nodes and hijacking the blockchain?

But it's increasing *exponentially* not linear. It went from 14000 to 30000 in *less than a year*. If there is a large jump in adoptions, we could start seeing the blockchain double every few months. Furthermore, the difference between transaction volume between Visa and Bitcoin are a couple orders of magnitude. Processing that volume and continuously adding on *thousands of transactions per second* will put definite stress on the Bitcoin network and infrastructure.
We can all say that bandwidth and storage is, presently, cheap. However, due to constant growth (which is exactly what we want) there should be a backup plan in case the blockchain size becomes unmanageable. Furthermore, bitcoin is currently popular in a lot of third world countries which lack a modern IT infrastructure. There is a risk that large-scale Bitcoin adoption may make the currency too unwieldy for them to use.

Are you saying that [this]( is not exponential growth? Because it sure as hell isn't linear.

Just did some checking and it looks like what you are saying is false. Is this not a blacklist?
    struct BlacklistEntry {
        uint32_t begin;
        uint32_t end;
        const char *name;
    };
    
    static struct BlacklistEntry BlacklistedPrefixes[] = {
        {0x946cb2e0, 0x946cb2e0, "Mastercoin"},
        {0x06f1b600, 0x06f1b6ff, "SatoshiDice"},
        {0x74db3700, 0x74db59ff, "BetCoin Dice"},
        {0xc4c5d791, 0xc4c5d791, "CHBS"},  // 1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T
        {0x434e5452, 0x434e5452, "Counterparty"},
        {0x069532d8, 0x069532da, "SatoshiBones"},
        {0xda5dde84, 0xda5dde94, "Lucky Bit"},
    };    
Calling it "ljr-antispam" does not make it any less a blacklist.
Furthermore, here is the discussion about this:

Segwit2x is compatible with BIP148 nodes and will trigger SetWit with no issue (since only 80% is needed). On the other hand, if activation is delayed by a few days, BIP148 nodes will fork themselves off the network in a chainsplit and, due to having less than 10% of hashing power behind them (if any) may not get enough blocks to activate SegWit on the BIP148 chain before the end of the activation threshhold (November 15th). This means no hashpower and no SegWit.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:24:48
The Segwit2x proposal (called Segwit2MB back then) preceded BIP148 by at least a month. BIP148 was never really any danger since the only people to be negatively affected by it would be the minority of users running a BIP148 nodes on a chain with, at most, one or two major miners.
What drove the economic majority to the NYA consensus were rising fees and ridiculously long confirmation times.

Keep in mind, Bitcoin only moved to Github in 2015 and, during the transition, some of the commit assignments may have gotten reassigned. That's why, for example, you see strange stuff like Greg having commits dated 2010 even though he only got involved in Bitcoin development years later.
EDIT: Just checked GitHub and can't find anything earlier than 2013 so...

Is this a joke? The only source for this is someone named "Flix" editing the bitcoin.it wiki. At this point it looks like anyone can make it say anything they want without anything to back it up. And what the hell is "Acc. until July"?
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:50:39
Bitcoin Core nodes will stop being compatible with BIP148 on August 1st. You'll have to switch to either a Segwit2x client or a BIP148 client. I'd recommend the Segwit2x client since that's more likely to get hashpower.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:38:04
You do realize a POW change would be a hardfork and a contentious one at that? So you want to hard fork in order to avoid a hard fork?
Furthermore, the NYA agreement was signed by entities from the world over. This is in direct contrast to the Hong Kong agreement signed between Adam Back, Luke Dashjr, and a group of Chinese miners (including Bitmain and BTCC).

Hi Kat,
Does this mean Blockstream will have the right to sue competing implementations that use any license other than the Defensive Patent License (i.e. MIT license, GPL, etc.)?
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:22:45
BIP148 does not hold anyone's feet to the fire due to a lack of hashing power behind it. You need miners to secure the network. As per design, only mining nodes count. BIP148's initial argument was it would succeed if the economic majority adopted it but, without adequate hashing power, the BIP148 chain would either stay stagnant or be open to manipulation due to lack of security (caused by a lack of hashing power mining on the BIP148 chain). Furthermore, the entities representing most users worldwide (i.e. the "economic majority") went with NYA instead.

Why would they buy BTC when they can rent a few virtual servers around the world, use IP aliasing to give multiple IPs to each one (thus making it seem like they are running a lot more nodes), and, in effect, shut down the entire bitcoin network? This shouldn't take a lot of money. Maybe a few hundred thousand.
As for the the bank branch thing - you brought it up and still have not explained how it is relevant to the conversation. A full node is not a bank branch. There is no incentive to run one. Full nodes are the weakest link in the bitcoin network and, as running one becomes more expensive, the bitcoin network becomes less secure.
Furthermore, you're assuming that the only reason to attack the bitcoin network would be to make money. This is not the only motive, however. If bitcoin becomes a threat to any national currency there would be political pressure to put a stop to it. If, let's say the ruble is tanking (which it is) and, suddenly, the CBR sees a large flight of capital to bitcoin, it could easily shutdown the whole network while utilizing a trivial sum of resources.
