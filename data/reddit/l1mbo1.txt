I'll take boobs.
But i don't understand why some guy who invests some millions can create such a surge?
The Dynamic of BTC and Alts is very interesting, I've noticed:
When BTC Surges - Alts bleed
When BTC Plummets - Alts bleed
When BTC sideways - Alts moon

So wait, we have a market cap of 200+ Billions and people go crazy for some dude to buy couple millions?

Agreed, better stfu about that. 
It's not unreasonable to think that a) people talk -ALOT- and b) people who hear from others, might get ideas about kidnapping some nerdy whale, apply some torture for couple of days and get yours.
Even as I am typing this, it sounds ridiculous, but we're potentially talking millions here, that can easily be moved somewhere completely unknown.

Then I'd like to ask you, how do you determine "breaking"?

Ah, subtle Shaun of the dead reference.

Teslas for all!

You might truly, REALLY kick yourself in the future. But hey, it's all about risk and the willingness to take it.
I wish you all the best and enjoy a carefree life!

Haha, good ol chappelle.
Seriously tho, i kind of feel bad, for the ones who FOMO'd into an highly likely (at the time) and in hindsight, very obvious P'n'D.
That might have destroyed around 30% of some new investors money...
