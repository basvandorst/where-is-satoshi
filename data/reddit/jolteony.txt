Imo, most of the people who don't know you can buy fractions of a Bitcoin wouldn't have even had any interest in it in the first place if it wasn't for the price. I agree, though, that using mBTC would make it way easier to express small values.

I've used Wireshark before, but why does it pose a security threat? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:57:14
Sure. Buy me one and I'll use it. ^/s

To the contrary. The only reason Bitcoin got so popular was because of the insane price. Making the price sound lower just makes people less interested in it.

Look through the program files folders, see if there are any wallets.

It does not address my point.

I just got this ad in Gmail. I presume you're going to stop using them and telling everyone you know to boycott them also?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:29:18
You said that you also don't see the coinmarketcap ads. So are you going to be a hypocrite? I fully expect you to make posts telling people to boycott Gmail and for you to tell everyone you know not to use Gmail.

I'd just like to interject for a moment.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:58:33
Honestly, who gives a shit about ads? They gotta make their money somehow.

My problem is you bitching about a perfectly good website just because you can't stand that they need to support the website somehow. You call me a shill, while you're actively shilling for livecoinwatch. It's not enough for you to suggest it, but you have to rail against coinmarketcap over nothing because you know there's nothing wrong with the site and you have no other way to get people to use your site.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:56:57
No. Much of the interest in Bitcoin is because of the high price.

Paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:51:51
And your point?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:55:51
So difficulty is constantly adjusted so that blocks are always about 10 minutes apart, no matter the number of pending transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:10:23
It's the exact same thing as any other ad. Do you say the same to sites that have ads that say you're the one millionth visitor or stuff like that? Because those are also scams.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:46:53
If you didn't give a shit about people falling for scams, then this thread wouldn't exist, genius.

I was confused when I read the comments. Only realized what was going on when I saw the pic. Great job op
