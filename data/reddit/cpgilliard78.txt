Not true. In 1982, treasuries were yielding in the up to 15%+. This zero yeild environment is a present day phenomenon. Any bond with no yeild is not a sound investment. It only works today because a massive amount of currency units are being produced just to manipulate the interest rates down.

What's even more interesting is that Andrew polestra  said he thinks he can get payment channels to work with mimblewimble. If he can, that means we can have lightning network for mimblewimble.

Lightning can have it's own privacy even if the underlying channels are not private. There are some papers that discuss a tor like routing protocol for lightning.

There is not a significant distinction between what you have proposed and rollbacks.

Yeah, exactly, lightning network should stop doing all that pesky design work and release something already. Look at how fast slockit released the DAO. Come on lightning devs! Stop taking those cia bribes to ruin bitcoin! /s

Then why are you suggesting using lightning network on Monero? If most of the transactions are done on the second layer, the lower layer's privacy doesn't matter.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:09:15
Interesting suggestions. Maybe one of the other exchanges could buy them out. As you said their brand/customer list has value and they have other assets. Losing $60 million is a lot, but there is probably something left to be salvaged.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:55:53
This is amazing. I appreciate you being open, but it's just unbelievable to me that you had that much btc in something other than cold storage.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:31:35
Why would you store $20 this way in multisig?
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:58:18
I suspect it will be like credit cards where the leader is the visa of payments and then you have mastercard, discover, and american express. The rest are just minor players and everyone accepts visa. I think the dominance of the leader will be more pronounced than visa's is for cryptocurrencies because you have an open source standard. If I had to guess, in the long term the leader (which I see no reason that bitcoin won't continue to be) will hold 95%+ of the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. But, I guess we'll see.

@_date: 2016-08-25 23:43:31
Every product is unusable by some now. It makes sense for products to have niches. For bitcoin, that niche is people who need censorship resistance in their financial transactions. Also, I assume you are talking about higher fees, but bitcoin's fees are still low. Much lower than credit cards for every transaction that you can do on a credit card.
@_date: 2016-08-26 14:53:36
None of the technologies were talking about exist yet. It depends how things play out, but it's possible most transactions in the future occur on a mimblewimble sidechain and only large settlements occur on the mainchain. In that case the main chain UTXOs are not the bottleneck. There's also utxo commitments which address the growing utxo set size. I guess the main point is that there's a LOT we can do before increasing the block size (it's clear to that occurs after we hit visa scale). There will also be breakthroughs that we don't know yet.
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:00:36
Yep, even though it's very seductive to believe that this is some kind of hidden message, it appears to not be.

They store the bitcoin's for the bitcoin investment trust or gbtc.
@_date: 2016-08-13 10:44:07
Since the data in the blockchain is replicated accross all nodes, it should be redicoulasly expensive to store data there. Which fortunately, it is from your example. I wouldn't characterize that as FUD.
@_date: 2016-08-12 03:14:01

@_date: 2016-08-07 05:53:39
On paper it makes sense, but who will continue to use this exchange after what happened?  I can't see them being profitable.
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:51:21
In the long run, these types of hacks will make bitcoin more resilient. Exchanges will implement true cold storage, do multisig where the customer holds one of the keys, or become decentralized like bitsquare. So if that's the government strategy, they should rethink it. Not saying your wrong though. I could see them doing that.
@_date: 2016-08-30 19:16:57

Segwit gives you an effective 1.7mb. Isn't that enough for right now since we have things like lightning network coming?
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:00:32
I agree these are two of the requirements. I would add that the payments must be anonymized as well by some means. Lightning network (with some of the proposed routing methodologies) fulfills all of these requirements.
@_date: 2016-08-28 20:11:13
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:58:40
It's not that simple. Traders provide the needed liquidity to the system. Without them, the price would be even more volatile than it is today. You can't trade if you don't have your money on an exchange. There are some promising things like decentralized exchange bitsquare, but it is not ready for large scale use yet. The solution is for exchanges to use cold storage. Shapeshift.io did that and they did not go under.
@_date: 2016-08-26 14:14:08
No it won't. Segwit + Schnorr signatures + Coinjoin gets us to around 15 tps. Lightning network gives us more than several hundred X scaling. That puts us above Visa's 2000 tps average transactions per second.
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:31:36
LOL, Nicely done!
@_date: 2016-08-28 03:40:36
I think you make some good points. Regarding your "wish", I believe bitcoin will allow for instant transactions and be untraceable in the not so distant future. The other part of the analysis is that the sheep will eventually get sheered. We've had over 7 years of expansion since the last financial collapse, and we haven't fixed anything and we're in even worse financial shape than before the great recession. There are many commentators calling for an even worse recession than the last one. This will result in waking up more sheep. They will look to solutions and maybe by that time, the bitcoin solution will be ready for them.
@_date: 2016-08-30 01:15:56
For some reason this video reminds me of Roger Ver designing bitcoin: 
@_date: 2016-08-27 18:14:12
Things like change tip and others can make it easy to use for the average person, but if the price goes up it will bring in investment for improved versions of those products. The problem with pegged coin is you have to peg them to something like the dollar or euro. It would be much better if we had a stable bitcoin instead of those. That can only happen at a much higher price.
@_date: 2016-08-28 14:44:00
Yes. Once they are running 0.13.1, they will be signaling that they support segwit. As soon as we get 95% of blocks that support segwit, after a 2 week grace period, segwit will be active. It will probably take to around the end of the year for all of this to happen.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:45:05
How is this incorporated into bitcoin? Sidechain?
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:53:04
I think this is right, but I think that a high percentage will be held in the leading currency though.
@_date: 2016-08-27 15:17:53
This might sound wierd, but one of the main things I think we need is for the price to go way up. That will bring in a lot of people. It will also fund the development of many of the required things. In terms of your list, I don't think the addresses are that big a problem. Things like mycelium wallet (or others) make it as simple as scanning a qr code which more and more people are learning. Think about all the things we needed to learn to use the internet. Pegged coins are also not needed. If the price goes up a lot, the exchange rate will be much more stable. I think the work that is being done with lightning network and fungability  (i.  e. Mimblewimble, onion routing for ln, etc) is crucial.
@_date: 2016-04-17 02:33:37
It's an interesting idea, but given the choice of a non-expiring currency like bitcoin I don't see people wanting to use it.
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:05:08
I think his point is that you should keep your private keys yourself and not trust anyone else to manage them for you because even though you may trust a provider today, you never know if they will be trustworthy tomorrow.
@_date: 2016-04-15 18:15:20
If Bitcoin becomes a widely used means of exchange, it will have to have a market cap in line with other top currencies. You can see a list here: 
@_date: 2016-04-13 12:11:18
Because its not about what's easiest to code, it's about what's lowest risk to the system. That's segwit, LN, Shnorr signatures.
@_date: 2016-04-06 22:07:39
You don't need to trust LN nodes. All they can do is delay a payment and thrn you just revert back to using bitcoin. Read the LN paper.
@_date: 2016-08-26 14:34:15
Mimblewimble addresses that.
@_date: 2016-04-23 00:35:30
It's kind of interesting. It's a sign of how distorted financial markets are. It seems to me that it makes a whole lot more sense for one to store their bitcoins themselves as opposed to using GBTC because you remove counterparty risk by holding them yourself. As a second option, it would be better to store them with a bitcoin vault (e.g. Coinbase, Xapo, etc) if you are incapable of securing them yourself. GBTC's only advantages are the ones that result from regulations and taxes. They have more value because you can hold them in an IRA. They have more value because legally there are number of cases where people can't hold anything that's not a stock (e.g. most mutual funds, pension funds, etc). In a truly free market without all these external considerations, everyone would hold bitcoins themselves or pay someone to hold them for them. For now the distortions are alive and well though.

@_date: 2016-04-09 05:23:00
Yeah, seriously, there's like some kind of invisible wall around the people that have used bitcoin where we can see things that others can't. Good example of information asymmetry.
@_date: 2016-04-10 08:51:36

@_date: 2016-04-11 04:16:41
Does the fact that 94% are using core tell you that they are all not on the fence?
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:15:23
Yes, it's basically an improved version of coinjoin. You are anonymous even to the other participants in your join.
@_date: 2016-04-12 21:15:28
Even though LN/Segwit/Shnorr signatures are more complicated, there's little risk to adding them because no one is required to use them. If you have coins in cold storage, there's no effect to you. On the other hand, if we do a contentious hard fork and end up in the scenario that you said was a 0.5% chance of happening, we've got major issues because price is going to tank and we'll have something on the order of Mt gox or worse.
@_date: 2016-04-15 20:52:07
The Jamaican currency is not widely used and is probably backed by USD. Lets make it simple: BItcoin is not particularly stable right now (maybe for the last few weeks, but over the last few years, it's been volatile). With a higher market cap, it will become more stable because there are fewer people that could manipulate it.
You're opinion is Bitcoin will never be as widely used as a major currency like USD/Yuan/Euro. The future is long, we'll see.
@_date: 2016-04-30 22:46:24
I accept that people are calling these things blockchains. I just disagree with that. I would call these things distributed databases. Very inefficient ones. They might even be useful to some degree, but I just don't consider them blockchains. I think 20+ years out, the vast majority of this stuff will be done on the bitcoin blockchain or (less likely) another blockchain that has a token (ethereum, litecoin, etc).

@_date: 2016-04-15 17:40:23
It's pretty stable at this particular moment, but I don't expect that to last. It goes in phases of more stable/less stable and there's no reason to think that will stop. Right now, with a ~6 billion market cap, there are many entities that can enter into the market and easily manipulate things. If the market cap were say $6 trillion (like gold), it would be harder to manipulate because fewer people would have the capital to do so.
@_date: 2016-04-13 17:13:41
actually, even if funds are in LN and for some reason you want to get them off as long as the counterparty cooperates you could do a standard bitcoin transaction to close out the locked funds and send them directly to the desired recipient. No different than any other bitcoin transaction. The worst case is that you want to get the funds out of LN and your counterparty does not cooperate, then you might have to wait 24 hours or something. The counterparty has no reason to not cooperate though.
@_date: 2016-04-23 01:28:17

Onion routing is being implemented on top of LN. So, there's no issue with privacy. You seem to be coming at this from a very negative point of view. Today the space is small so the major companies and holders could cover all the need, but they by no means would lock in the consumers of LN, so I'm not sure what you're concern is. If people start behaving badly, you just close out your channel and reopen a new one with another provider.

@_date: 2016-04-08 21:47:48
As long as when you connect, there are at least 5 nodes, you should be able to route through them like this. But onion routing probably won't be deployed right off the bat.

I suspect that something like this will eventually happen. If they're smart, they'll do this after a long time when bitcoin grows into it's potential. At that time, you sell your bitcoin's and move into whatever alt is still decentralized.

Here's some slides: 
Segwit is required for level 3 support because you need a malleability fix to get optimum performance.
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:00:07
It would only speed up tx times for transactions that pay a low fee. If you pay a high enough fee (maybe around $.10 - $.20 today) you will get in the next block and higher capacity will have no impact. To me, I don't see the need for a hard forked increase to block size because segwit, lightning network, schnorr signatures, and coinjoin can get us to VISA scale. We can then talk about a hard fork at that point if we don't just do it in a sidechain.
@_date: 2016-04-22 14:39:56

I don't know about Denmark, but when the US was on a gold standard, there were little or no income taxes. The current high levels of taxation world wide are associated with the debt money systems. Sound money (like bitcoin or gold) would trend toward much lower taxation. What it comes down to is that when central banks can't print money, governments end up not being able to borrow limitless amounts of money and therefore they have a harder time funding things like tax compliance, etc. You can't really do static analysis like that.
@_date: 2016-04-11 03:10:27
While I agree mostly, classic controls about 6% of hash power. We need 95% concensus for CSV and segwit. Now is the time to convince those on the fence that are supporting classic.

The model should be to use micropayments for downloading content. In this way, you decouple ad revenue from viewing content. The cost to download would be minimal.

It's like other peer to peer networks. You will download a client which will discover other peers on the network and connect. Think of tor, you don't decide which tor nodes to connect to, it just connects automatically.

Lightning network doesn't change the fact that people can use Coinbase (or others) as their intermediary. They can also do that today. The point is that LN is trustless and you don't need to pick from a list of providers if you are using your own wallet as GP stated.
@_date: 2016-04-08 21:52:33
Yes, that's right. The formula is 1 X transaction data + 0.25 X signature data.
@_date: 2016-04-09 04:20:11
I really think that's a stretch, but even in that case, with CSV you can set the timeouts longer if you're worried about this. The only trade off is that your funds could be frozen for that amount of time when counterparties don't cooperate. Even if an attack lasts for over 3 months, you can still get a transaction in if you outbid the attacker. If you have a large amount of money on the line (e.g. $1 million or something) you'd put up a very large fee and be able to outbid your attacker. Maybe you pay a higher fee like $100 or something, but at least you don't lose your $1 million. Also, in this case where there's a clear attack over a very long period of time, LN nodes and miners could get together and make some kind of agreement to prioritize transactions, etc.

Yes, the 1.7 number comes from Pieter W's presentation at Hong Kong scaling. I believe he used current conditions in the blockchain to come to this number. In other words if everyone used segwit today, we'd see a 1.7x increase in throughput based on the proposed rules of segwit. A 4x level of compression will never happen because the signatures alone count for 0.25 x size of sigs. That means that for a 4x increase you'd have to have a block with only signature data and no actual transactions. 2x is likely assuming the trend towards multisig continues. You mentioned a LN transaction stalling forever because of someone not signing or other party losing their keys. Actually that's not possible. There is always a backup transaction that can be broadcast to the network which will resolve things. Yes, lightning network does not require any more trust than bitcoin itself. There are a lot of people that either don't understand it or are spreading misinformation which is causing a lot of confusion. The best option is to read the whitepaper.

He probably understands that segwit + shnorr sigs + lightning gives us more than 100x scaling and there's absolutely no reason to entertain a hard fork at this time when we can scale through these soft forks in a dramatically better way.
@_date: 2016-04-23 04:48:29
According to Adam Back's latest presentation, segwit + shnorr signatures gets us 3 - 4 x scaling and lightning network gets us 100 - 10,000x scaling. Combined that is 900 - 120,000 transactions per second with no hard fork and 1mb blocks. Why is it so urgent to go to 2mb right now again?
@_date: 2016-04-06 23:17:31

There will be a variable pace, but that's fine we don't need 900x scaling tomorrow we just need headroom in the protocol to scale over time. I've heard this argument that we don't really know what's going to happen with segwit/LN. It seems that's the main argument put forth against them these days. I think if one really looks into the proposals, you can see how they will dramatically increase scale. It's not nearly as mysterious as its detractors make it out to be.

Banks have infrastructure in place to judge credit worthiness, but it's mainly government imposed and not based on what the free markets will dictate. No one can realistically compete with banks on a large scale because they have the ability to do fractional reserve. This advantage goes away with bitcoin. Bitcoin loans do not have to be anonymous. I think we'll see new technology like webs of trust that are far superior to the way banks determine credit worthiness. Also, in an equity based currency, borrowing money will become less important.

1.) That's good. Glad you'll look at a pull request.
2.) RUDP was a good call. It makes connecting just work.
3.) This is where I take issue. I understand the concern about OB's reputation, but financial privacy is not just about selling drugs and the like. It's also about a vendor being able to keep his customer list private or people just not wanting someone to track their every move online. This fork was enevitable. I don't know if this will be successful or if it will be the next attempt, but personally I think it makes sense to have a single open bazaar so I hope that the changes needed for privacy will be merged in.
4.) I tend to agree that IPFS is a better place to merge this change into, I think it would be better if you guys made it clear to ipfs it's a big priority.

Bottom line for semi technical person: don't worry much about the details. They go deep. But it promises something like 100 - 10000x scaling of bitcoin through the use of some sophisticated smart contracts that allow people to repeatedly transact without hitting the bitcoin blockchain. It also gives us instant confirmation (with the same level of confirmed bitcoin transactions) when you have funds available in the network. There are also proposals to use onion routing to make payments anonymous. The fees are expected to approach 0. That's about it.
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:19:28
I see the biggest risk as economic fork. The others we can deal with. I see the split in the community as a problem and that it's manufactured, but I'm just giving you my considered opinion as a bitcoin holder. I agree with you that being against LN or segwit doesn't make sense.

Good question. I believe you could provide your signed HLTC to the seller to prove a transaction because the seller would be able to submit it to the network. If the seller still insisted they did not get paid, ultimately you could submit that transaction to the blockchain. Assuming the seller is cooperative you could ask them to digitally sign a receipt.

It comes down to game theory here. If I'm an attacker, I can spam the network to raise transaction fees in hopes that some funds will be stuck beyond some point where I'm advantaged. But if the person being attacked can also raise the fees, that makes the cost of spamming the network higher. You get a mutually assured destruction scenario where it doesn't make sense to do the attack.

@_date: 2016-04-08 18:58:47
All transactions have signatures, so segwit saves some space by moving them into a new data structure. But you are right that it saves more space for multisig. The reality is that people want to use multisig though. With the current mix of transactions that equates to about a 1.7x improvement. But multisig is getting more and more popular over time so that number is expected to go up. Lightning network exclusively uses multisig so there can be an expected increase in capacity for using it.
@_date: 2016-04-07 04:29:39


LN will take some of the fee pressure off the blockchain, not add to it. That's the whole point.


I'm just not seeing this scenario where the expense for the user goes way up. There will be a way to transact on the blockchain that is essentially free. In fact, it will probably get cheaper on a per transaction basis. It's probably not going to be totally free though.


Actually, I have:


The way the onion routing works is that you send the payments down a chain of nodes. If we use 5 nodes (like tor), that would mean the second node only knows who the first node and the third node are. The third node only knows the second and fourth, and so on. So, just like tor or I2P, if you're a node in the middle, you only know that bitcoin is being transferred between two nodes, you don't know who the source and destination is. It's really a beautiful design.


I've looked over the LN presentation and code extensively, and I think it has a lot of promise. In fact, I think in the future all participants in the Bitcoin network will be using LN for all transactions. That will be considered Bitcoin. This new layer will retain bitcoin's censorship resistance, and also give us anonymity (through onion routing), scalability, instant confirmations (at the same level of security as multiple confirmations). That's just what I'm seeing.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:29:12
This is exactly what I'm talking about. My understanding is you can only acceess a subdomain of the domain you're on. If you're example.com, you can only access sub.example.com.

Yeah, I believe something like child pays for parent could help resolve that problem. In that case, when a spam attack happens you could always make an additional child transaction with a high enough fee to get your transaction on the blockchain.

If the other party loses their keys or refuses to sign, you have a time limit to submit the transaction in some cases although I think CSV allows for longer time outs. Basically, if you're doing things correctly on your end, you cannot lose funds. He just made it seem that if the other party doesn't cooperate you could lose your funds. That's not true. It has to be both an uncooperative counterparty and a failure to act on your part in order to lose funds.

Yes, that's how it works. Lets use your example and expand a little on it. Sure, you could send the payment to bob who would send it to alice, but then bob would know both the sender and recipient. Instead, you would send it to bob and bob would be asked to send it to charlie and charlie would be asked to send it to dan and dan would be asked to send it to egbert and egbert would be asked to send it to alice. Now bob just knows that you are sending him money and that he was subsequently asked to send it to charlie. The other people similarly only know about the prev/next people in the chain. That's how onion routing works. Obviously some of the people's names could actually be companies, or it could be a combination of private individuals and companies, etc, but if you have enough hops, you maintain your anonymity to a fairly good extent. Of course nothing's perfect, but like tor you end up getting a fairly good amount of anonymity. If you plan on running the next silk road, it's probably not good enough, but if you don't want your landlord to know how much money you're making, you're probably good. Glad I could clear some of it up for you.

Anything that the government pays for is more expensive than if it were done in the private sector. That is because there is no competition. This includes any schooling.

Historically, a small percentage of people went to college (in 1940s it was about 4% that completed a degree, in 2016 it was over 30%). It will revert back to the mean in due time. The incentives in the current system are totally distorted due to fiat money printing. When governments/central banks can't print unlimited money, these distortions will disappear and things will straighten out. College is really a good option for people that are in the top 5% academically. Outside of that, most people are better off learning a skill or trade.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:55:21
I don't trust those statistics because basically the college education system has become too big to fail so there's all kinds of fudging of the numbers that goes on. Even if the unemployment rate is 50% less, that doesn't mean that it's more profitable to go to college. There are many hidden costs that these kinds of statistics don't take into account. For instance, they don't take into count the 4+ years of a head start that people that don't go to college get. Also, they don't count interest on student loans. The other thing I'd say is correlation is not causation. It may be true that people that actually manage to complete a degree are more likely to be able to stick to things which is a trait that makes them more employable. What's starting to happen though is that the savvy younger people are starting to understand that you don't get a good ROI for completing a standard college degree. They are opting for things like online learning, on the job training, etc. People talk about Bitcoin being a bubble, but if you want to talk about bubbles, look at the university system.

The non aggression principal says that it is never justified to initiate violence. This means you can only use force (or the threat there of) to defend yourself.

You're assumption is that getting the college degree will result in a better paying job and that it will pay enough to make up for the tuition, expenses, lost time, and interest on student loans.

When I say 'gun point' I mean that in order to obtain basic income to distribute it to others, it has to come from somewhere. You have to either create it through inflation, taxation, or in some other way. All those things are theft backed up through violence. Leave crazy lady with cats alone. If you want to improve your lifestyle figure out how to create a product or service that people want and stop thinking about how to steal from people. In terms of the current system that you refer to as 'super capitalism', it has nothing to do with capitalism. It is more like crony capitalism where rich bankers and their buddies bribe politicians to regulate their competition out of business.

Democracy has it's own set of problems, but bitcoin is not democracy. I think it will be more difficult to change bitcoin, other than in a way that is an obvious win (e.g. bug fix), but in the end this difficulty to change is a feature because it makes it less susceptible to things like people raising the number of bitcoin issued above 21 m. We will eventually increase the block size, but probably only after the blocks fill up. That is my feeling.

The store of value use case has nothing to do with "illegal stuff". The value of bitcoin has proven beyond all doubts that's it's real money and I think we're only getting warmed up. The US dollar is real money, but when I go to China I exchange some for Yuan. That doesn't mean it's not real.

Since there are no settlement networks that support all the world's transactions there will be a distinction between payment and settlement at least for a while. Even if the blocksize grew to 1gb, something which would completely centralize bitcoin, bitcoin would not even support the visa network's capacity, which is a relatively small percentage of the world's transactions. Fortunately, we don't need to settle all payments on the blockchain and we can even keep the same level of trust by using lightning network for payments which uses the blockchain as a settlement mechanism.

The big difference between COIN and GBTC to me is that COIN will have a real time creation/redemption mechanism. This means that a person or group of people called authorized participant (AP) can create or redeem shares of the ETF in real time. The significance of this is that the price of the ETF will be tied more directly to bitcoin's price because the AP can buy/sell bitcoin on exchanges to keep the price of the ETF in sync with the Bitcoin price. This means that the ETF will also instantly have way more liquidity than GBTC. So, if a hedge fund manager wants to put $10 million into bitcoin, all they need to do is buy through their regular procedure for buying stocks.

I guess some of my optimism comes from the fact that many of the anarchists I know are vegan/vegetarian. I myself am vegetarian (almost vegan except for occasional cheese). Also, look at the native americans. They lived without any real government and they also lived in harmony with their environment. I personally would extend the non aggression principal to animals which is one of the reasons I don't eat meat. In any case, we have a coercive government and it is not preventing over fishing or rhino hunting so I don't hold out much hope that a government could be successful in preventing that. I actually think that the government/media/corporations encourage people to eat meat which only makes these problems worse.

With new technology comes new capabilities. The vision is that LN is basically something that everyone on the network participates in. In that scenario, you'd basically use LN like a savings account so that you could make some risk free interest on your savings by charging lightning network fees.

Today that wouldn't be possible because every merchant cannot be a bank, but with Bitcoin, it's just software.

I see the exact opposite of what you see. Places where government regulation are involved work terribly. For example, bitcoin (unregulated) works much better than modern banking (regulated). I guess I trust mother nature to make these decisions more than a central planner so I don't see any reason why fisheries wouldn't voluntarily agree to do what's right for the long term. In terms of being manipulated, I think you are underestimating people, but if someone voluntarily makes a bad agreement, they will learn from it, but if we cottle them they will never learn. I'm not sure how having a coercive government will prevent people from making bad decisions either, but I have a feeling it will not be possible to convince you.

The reason you would trust an uber driver is:
1. Uber has done some sort of background check on the driver.
2. Uber has a ratings system.
A decentralized version could still provide both of these checks to ensure a driver has been vetted because there could be independent driver certification services that do exactly what uber does or something similar. The great thing about bitcoin is that it is unbundling traditionally bundled services.
In terms of competing with uber who fights dirty, the main benefit that a decentralized service has over a centralized service is that there is no profit motive in a decentralized service so it ends up cutting out middlemen and allowing for direct competition between service providers.

The problem with centralized hubs is that it would be capital intensive and that you also have no barrier to entry. In short, it is just not a good business model. What is likely to occur is that many people will end up being on the lightning network and within something like 6-7 hops you will end up having a connection to everyone else.

He says a lot of things I have been feeling as well. The puzzle works like this: some extremely wealthy people have invested $1 billion in bitcoin startups over the last 3 years or so. Those investments will not pay off if bitcoin has a monetary base of $6 billion. What will those people do? Those same people can easily invest a similar amount into bitcoin itself. That would drive the price up substantially. Combine that with the block halvening. I think we can easily see a $100 billion market cap in the next few years.

Yes, in some sense there already is no block size cap because miners can change the limit. It is not in their interest to change until there is price pressure though.

Good move. Not because they are running bitcoinXT, which I think is a bad business decision, but because people should hold their own private keys which is not generally the case when people use coinbase. I would consider coinbase/circle more of bitcoin banks than pure wallets. It might be better for them create an on/off ramp or exchange section to include coinbase and circle.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:25:28
It doesn't matter much to me if that is what they are doing. The question is whether that's the best option. The thing is all the world's transactions will never be able to fit on the blockchain so there will be some scarcity. Imagine all the coupons, NASDAQ trades, notary, etc on top of all the money transactions. It won't fit into the blockchain without having some sort of pricing mechanism. It's better to run into that price wall early before we get too far along.
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:24:04
I see all these things being resolved eventually (maybe 10 years, but probably less). For scaling there is lightning network, segregated witness, iblt, relay network, etc. For anonymity/fungibility there's coinjoin, ring signatures, zerocoin, etc.
The banks will find it hard to compete with an open and permissionless system that is censorship resistant.

At any given point there are a group of people who have access to their bitcoin. It doesn't matter if that's all 21M or some other subset. Lets say 20% of those 21M coins are of dead/jailed/MIA people that leaves 16.8M coins. The owners of those are the people who control bitcoin. Those people (no matter how many or who they are have an interest in preserving the value of their btc) In aggregate, those people will behave rationally. It would be irrational for those people to agree to debase their own coins no matter if this includes Satoshi or not or if there's 21M coins or 16M or whatever. I can speak for myself as a bitcoin holder. I would spend coins on the new debased chain. I would most likely move those coins immediately into other investments. I would not do this with the coins that are on the old chain. I expect other owners of btc to behave rationally in a similar way to what I described. If I am in jail or MIA, and I am not able to access my coins, I would expect the rest of the people that own btc in aggregate to do what I have described with or without me or anyone else. This will cause sell pressure on the new chain which will eventually cause mining to move onto the old chain. The new chain would be unprofitable to mine and eventually die out. There is a saying that "don't throw good money after bad". It basically describes exactly the situation that we'd have if there was a bitcoin fork and one part of the chain had an increased supply.

You're going down a different rabbit hole now. You are basically saying that force is the only way to solve the poaching problem and so you need a Government. Fine, but that doesn't negate my point that the defining characteristic of a Government is use of force. That is the reality, if it wasn't the case, you'd be able to argue that McDonalds is a government, and it's not reasonable to start talking about everything as a Government. You're just saying that sometimes you need to use violence. Now to answer the question about how to deal with poachers, if we didn't have Governments (who literally own all the land), multiple private individuals/entities would own the land. They could voluntarily make whatever agreements about poaching they find agreeable and anyone who used their land would be required to abide by those agreements or they wouldn't be allowed on the property.

Thank you for raising this great point. I have thought for a while that it would be very profitable for a person or group of people that have massive financial resources behind them to cause a hard fork to occur. Basically, what you would do is pay 75% of miners to mine BIP101 blocks. As soon as you hit 75%, you stop paying them. Some of them will probably revert back to mining non BIP101 blocks, but if they don't you can always pay (maybe 10% to continue mining non BIP101 blocks). At this point, you start pumping the BIP101 chain to all time highs and say when it hits $10,000, you start selling BIP101 bitcoin and buying bitcoin classic. Just a thought, but something we should be aware of.
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:41:11

Dark Wallet has stated the intention to implement coinshuffle. They also use stealth addresses. Coinshuffle is quite good actually.

I was responding to this comment:


He explicitly says 20MB.
I guess my overall point here is: It is possible to do some engineering work  that will allow for scaling to 20MB and beyond and not lead to additional centralization. It's not easy work, but doable in my opinion. The things that need to be done are:
1.) Introduce Gavin's IBLT into the core protocol.
2.) Optimize (possibly through either software or hardware or both) the block validation code.
I view the problem like this: our critical path that leads to centralization is the point where a node finds a block to the point where the majority of the network confirms it. Lets analyze that path very thoroughly from a code point of view and see what we can do. Most people are talking about tradeoffs or complete re-architectures when we can actually just optimize the hell out of that code path. That's what I suggest, then maybe no tradeoffs need to be made at all.
@_date: 2015-06-11 02:51:16
The economics are simple. The more supply (higher block limit) the better. The question is: does a bigger block size lead to more centralization and to what extent which is a comp sci question.

Bitcoin has something like a million times the security of its nearest competition (litecoin). It also pretty much has 100% of the dev market share working on apps. Merchant adoption is WAY stronger than anything else. It's an exceptionally strong network effect. There's at least nothing on the horizon that could unseat it which is why all the capital investment is going into the bitcoin blockchain and not others.

Again it's not ideal that mining fees go to $2 but I'm just saying it doesn't break bitcoin. You could use lightning network and do 100 transactions for the price of two mining fees. You can also do offchain transactions. I think scaling will work and there will be larger blocks, but it's preferable to be conservative even if it means higher mining fees for a while while solutions get worked out.

I read the word individual in your first paragraph, but it still doesn't explain how a government is allowed to do something that an individual is not. How can someone transfer a government a right they don't have?
There are not really any examples of places with no government because the authorities know that if a geographical region were allowed to grow without a government, it would grow to be the most prosperous area of the world in short notice due to the lack of regulation and taxes capital would flow there quickly and it would grow fast and thus eventually challenge their authority. There is actually someone trying to start a country called liberland which would basically have no government, but the neighboring government arested him just for going on the land. It is fairly clear that when government gets out of the way, countries prosper. Look at Russia of today compared to the Soviet Union of the past. Or, look at the US in the 1800s compared to today. In fact, this is what natural law is based on. It turns out that people have studied what ends up being optimal parameters for an economy to prosper and the trick is to pretty much not do anything other than protecting people's civil liberties. This is the basis for natural law.

Bitcoin will have fairly significant inflation for quite some time. When the inflation starts to decrease, obviously transaction fees will need to replace inflation (unless there's a fork like you suggest). You do bring up an interesting point though which is worth considering, but I still don't think a fork will win out over the original. If Bitcoin becomes the global reserve currency, the transaction fees must go up a lot higher than they are today. I believe the average user will not conduct many on chain transactions in the future. Most transactions will move to things like the lightning network in which a user can do 1 transaction on the blockchain every 6 months (see paper at  for details), but still do unlimited number of transactions through the lightning network without incurring any miner fees.  So, in this scenario higher transaction fees do not discourage bitcoin users from transacting because it's a rare occurrence that they need to do an on chain transaction. Spread across 7 billion people these twice a year mining fees are negligible. Certainly not worth risking the sanctity of the 21M block limit to avoid something like that.

@_date: 2015-12-27 02:54:49
For me, it is best to just hold your own private keys and not loan them out at this time. The reason is that bitcoin is a very volatile currency at this point. Bitcoin could go to $0 or it could go to $100,000 or more so lending doesn't make sense. For example, if you lent out your 16 bitcoin in today's value (&lt;$7000) and the value went to $10,000. The person would owe you the equivalent of $160,000. There is a very good chance you won't get your principal returned to you. Just by holding bitcoin, you have a tremendous upside so your focus should be on holding them securely as opposed to maximizing yeild. Either invest in a hardware wallet or use paper wallets with BIP38 password.

You didn't answer my question, but I assume you meant they're planning on running a bunch of centralized hubs on LN which they have stated they are not doing and also would not make economic sense for them to do. Also, they only have one developer working on LN (Rusty Russel) and I've seen him working on iblt lately, so even he is not dedicated. The main people working on LN now are the people who wrote the paper. I don't see how anyone really makes big money on LN. The only thing I see is a few devs that are working on it with hopes of possibly doing some consulting in the future, but if that's the motive, they could build anything in the Bitcoin ecosystem that they think will be useful and then do consulting on that. So, basically, I don't see the whole conspiracy theory blockstream angle.

Even blockstream supports larger blocks (e.g. Adam Backs 2-4-8 proposal.) I think the argument is over whether we should do something like BIP 101 or the 2-4-8 proposal. The notion that blockstream could not earn anything if there were not off chain solutions is just silly. You could argue that lightning network makes their liquid side chain product obsolete so I think they have a conflict of interest to not develop LN, yet they are. From what I understand, they own timelocked bitcoin and that is their primary motivation.

Well, this is basically what was attempted when the internet came out. There were a number of competing protocols that were promoted by consortiums. In fact, Cisco (and others) couldn't even bring themselves to say the word "internet". They called it "the information super highway". A very similar thing to what is happening with some executives who use "blockchain" when they are really talking about bitcoin. None of these protocols saw the light of day and today the internet is without question the winner. I understand you think things will play out differently with bitcoin. I disagree with you and all of the vcs and smart money that are funding the bitcoin ecosystem disagree with you as well.

Ok, but it does not work as escrow because the lightning network is a hub and spoke model so you don't have an arbiter as you do in open bazaar.

I guess, it just feels like giving btc holders the right to vote for something that increases the cost on the miners. I think that the people that are in the best position to make these decisions are those that have skin in the game, the miners themselves. I suspect this is why no blocks are being mined with BIP101, yet major btc holders (e.g. Roger Ver who I understand has more than 100,000 btc) are supporting BIP101. The miners (like f2pool see what a disaster BIP101 would be). What it comes down to is that I think the hash vote is a smarter vote and is aligned with incentives better.

The issue with archive.org is that it is not tamperproof where bitcoin is effectively tamperproof. I also would like to understand better what Bryne wants that bitcoin doesn't have. The SEC filing describes a system by which proof of the state of the internal ledger is hashed into the blockchain. This at least gets you a consistent state every 10 minutes, but I'm guessing he is hoping to get bids/offers provable and immutibly stored into a blockchain. Who knows though until he clarifies. I suspect anything he wants can and will be implemented as a side chain and potentially merged into bitcoin proper.

The visa network does more than 10,000 QPS at peak so if bitcoin gets to that size and we dont use other layers, blocks would be 3 GB (assuming 500 byte transactions). From what I understand there are Chinese payment networks that do 100,000 QPS. I just don't see how we do all the world's transactions on the blockchain, we inevitability need to move many transactions to the layers above (e.g. lightning network).

Your question could also be phrazed as: why would one invest money? There are many potential answers to that question. Paying off ones mortgage is a good answer to that question.

Ok corrupt is probably the wrong term.

I guess I see this differently than most. First off, based on T0s SEC filing, they will only need to do 1 bitcoin transaction per block to timestamp all their data in their internal ledger, so they actually won't use more than 7 tps. I see bitcoin as a competition to get into the blockchain. If you are using bitcoin for a high value use case like t0, you will probably be willing to pay quite a bit to get included. Eventually, that would force some of what you are calling legitimate transactions off the blockchain. So, maybe someone buying coffee is not willing to pay $1 transaction fee. That's OK. They are building lightning network for this purpose. Also, there are off blockchain solutions in the mean time. We have to face the reality that a fee market will eventually develop. It will only make bitcoin stronger.
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:07:53
How would this be enforced on something like OpenBazaar?

My background is in software, not finance, however I understand the basics of how the system works. We have central banks that issue currencies at will and banks that can essentially create money through fractional reserve banking. Bitcoin (especially when people hold their private keys, which I believe is the state where things will naturally move to) solves the problems that this system has. Sure, we can try other systems, but I agree with the bets the vcs are making that the rails of the new financial system will be the bitcoin blockchain. It's kind of like the internet. The telcos didn't want the internet to be the system, but it ended up being the system that was used widely due to network effects.

Yes, the way to prevent it is when this happens, you save your bitcoins on the old chain and spend the bitcoins on the new chain. If everyone does this, the price of the new bitcoins will collapse. This is exactly what happened when the dollar went off the gold standard. The price of gold went up and the dollar went down. (albeit over a long period of time). I wouldn't put it past someone to try this, but it won't happen for a while and when it does bitcoin holders have an easy solution.

What it comes down to is that settlement (even on bitcoin) is more expensive than payments.

I commend him for a relatively fair treatment of bitcoin, but still want to address what he refers to as the costs of bitcoin:


He's talking about Bitcoin of today. People are still trying to figure out if Bitcoin is going to become a widely used currency and it's bound to be volatile because even a relatively small purchase or sell can move the market. It's volatility has been decreasing over the years though and if it becomes a widely used currency (e.g. a monetary base of $1 Trillion plus) it will not be nearly as volatile as it is today.


No it doesn't. You cannot make a backup or multiple copies of your paper cash. You can't store your cash with multi-sig (multiple private keys, e.g. 3 of 5). It's much more powerful than cash. We're still working out models for how to make securing bitcoin user friendly, but I think mycelium is doing a fairly decent job by forcing you to write down your 12 word pass phrase when you create a wallet. If you make two or three copies of this backup and store it in different locations, you're done and you have basically removed the risk of losing bitcoin on your phone due to accidental loss. When this is combined with a hardware wallet integrated into a cell phone, it will probably be the hardest money to lose that we've ever had.


I suspect this hypothetical trusted ledger is impossible to build and it certainly has never existed. It seems to me that the goal of fiat currency is to be a "trusted ledger", but there is a long history of fiat currencies failing: 


He answered this one himself. The supposed danger of cash is that people are allowed to use it to buy things that the government might not want them to buy. But, unless we ban cash, this will always be the case. People generally like cash and don't want to it to be banned because it's useful.

It needs to be done at the protocol level to be effective. I think tree chains (and other concepts where you decrease from n^2) are interesting, but they are just too risky to do in bitcoin itself. It probably makes sense to do it in an alt coin actually or maybe in a sidechain. Bitcoin can still scale decently with a new message type for iblt.

Bitcoin is completely equal opportunity. Anyone can mine it. Anyone can earn it.

I suppose it's possible, but I don't see it as very likely. The difference is that fiat is very convenient for payments. More convenient than gold. With Bitcoin, it will be a superior as a payment method as well as being a superior asset. If fiat is still used, I think it will only be used to pay taxes and lawsuits.

If you (or the people) don't have the right to tell someone not to fish, then how can the people give the government the right to do that on their behalf?
I think all governments start out "good" and end up "bad". It is just the nature of what happens. The US government in 1776 was actually pretty good overall, but turned into what we have today. It is because having that kind of power attracts bad actors who corrupt it over time. In terms of the government in the US being under funded, the tax revenue is over $3 trillion. I'm by no means rich, I live in a two bedroom condo, yet I pay more than half of my income to taxes if you include state and federal income tax, social security, medicare, sales tax, property tax, etc. How much more do I need to pay to get " good" government?

Any of the proposals (BIP100, 100.5, 101, etc) if adopted are "leaving it to the free market" because unless coercion is used (e.g. threatening fines, jail time for running a particular piece of software) everyone is free to do what they want. The miners ultimately get a big say in what is adopted because they run the software. Bitcoin owners also get a say because they can sell either side of the chain in the event of a fork so it doesn't pay for the miners to do something that hurts btc owners.

To some extent it's true that anyone can open a bank, but bitcoin is better because with banking, there is regulation and people can decide if you are permitted to open a bank.

Originally, I thought you were advocating having a block reward of fixed size and then removing at a date in the future. That would be an extreme drop off that might kill the system. Now you are saying cutting the reward in half every 4 years is too drastic. Which is it? I actually agree that a smoother transition would be better. In other words, instead of going from 50 btc to 25 btc per block on one day, it would be better to from 50 to 49.9 to 49.8.....you could even keep the same rate of decrease but just smooth out the transition. I don't think anyone is claiming bitcoin is a perfect system, it's just good enough to create a scehelling point. When you nit pick the parameters it just appears to me that you are missing the big picture of the fact that we have digital sound money in Bitcoin.
In terms of it being unfair about the 1%. They will not stay in the 1% unless they continue to provide value. This is the big difference to the fiat system where central banks can indefinitely create money at the expense of the masses despite whether or not they are providing any value. With Bitcoin, those that provide the most value will move up the ladder more quickly becuase there's no one who creates money. The miners are just converting energy into Bitcoin and everyone else has to provide a product or a service that someone who has Bitcoin wants.
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:13:53
First of all, that wasn't my claim it was OPs. Second, he wasn't saying Bitcoin was perfect, just that the fact that average Libertarians were the first adopters makes it egalitarian. I'm not sure I exactly agree with OP on that. I guess I would say, it's good that Libertarians were the early adopters and that Bitcoin is more egalitarian than any form of money we've seen thus far.
Regarding the Winklevoss, it really depends how well they protect their private keys mostly. Even if they manage their keys properly, their heirs may not be as wise as they are and will undoubtably have less Bitcoin progressively each generation because they won't be able to create money like central bankers can.
I think you have fallen for the false narrative that Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffet are the richest people in the world. I know most people think that and they probably have the highest net worth the way the Forbes calculates it, but there are definitely richer families that control much more money than these three. It's just that those families keep their money in trusts which don't show up on someone's net worth. They also pool their assets. Again, the Federal Reserve loaned around $600 billion into existence this year. Someone (or a group of people) owns the Federal Reserve, it's not the government. What are those people's net worths? I mean, when you start to think about it's kinda silly to believe that the three richest men in the world are all self made. Of course the families that control the banking and political systems are more wealthy. So, the Winklevoss would be very rich if Bitcoin were as valuable as you mentioned, but they would not have the perpetual advantage that central bankers have today. And that is the key difference and why Bitcoin is more egalitarian than fiat.
@_date: 2015-06-14 22:11:14
The block reward can be converted to fiat at any number of exchanges. I don't think consumer usage is that important at this phase. Bitcoin needs to become an asset before it's a payment network. The payment network does have some enormous benefits, but that will come in time.

@_date: 2018-05-15 13:05:33
First of all it's still early. Second, like I have already said the key difference between fiat and bitcoin is that with bitcoin the only way you can have a bitcoin is by either:
a.) mining it (converting energy into bitcoin).
b.) trading a product or service for it.
With fiat the central bank creates the money by loaning it into existence. They don't have to do any work.
So, no one was handed Bitcoin. They either converted energy into it or traded something of value for it. You are really having a hard time getting out of the fiat mentality. It's just not like fiat where people actually just get it. No one got it for free.
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:06:10
Some of the more establishment type guys were there at the beginning to maintain the system. That was needed while Bitcoin is establishing itself. Tillerson for example is already out. Trump is basically up against the deep state and a big part of it is the current banking system. We'll see about his appointees, but to me it's very clear he's appointing people who support Bitcoin to the positions that matter. For example OMB Director Mike Mulvaney, who has been pro-bitcoin, even before being appointed and CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo. Those are the ones who matters. The secretary of state doesn't really come into play.

The exponentially decreasing reward structure is necessary to make the transition from block reward subsidy to transaction fees smooth. A constant block reward with an immediate transition to transaction fees on a specific date would be very dissruptive. No one would know if it's going to work causing a lot of fear and volatility. To say a constant block reward would have been more egalitarian, even though it might cause the system to not function properly, to me is also not correct. You keep thinking that mining for a block reward subsidy is this special thing when it's not. Miners compete fiercly for the block reward and transaction fees. It's a very low margin business and quite frankly not that interesting to me. If you instead made the claim that early adopters (I'm talking about bitcoin owners, not miners) of Bitcoin will make an enormous profit if Bitcoin is adopted as a world reserve currency, then yes I'd say you are right. But early adopters also took great risk. With great risk comes great reward. Instead of being so jealous of early adopters, you should celebrate them. In terms of your question about 130 years vs. some other number, I don't really know what is more or less egalitarian. I don't think Satoshi was thinking about that at all when he picked the parameters. His top concern was probably making sure he picked a far enough out date such that the transition from subsidy to fees happened smoothly.

As others have pointed out, no one is given bitcoin. Bitcoin is created by provably destroying energy. Anyone can do this. No one is able to give out bitcoin. The only way to obtain bitcoin is by burning energy or creating a product or service that those that have bitcoin are willing to trade for. There is no more egalitarian system than this.

Fiat gives all created money to the central banks. It's completely disingenuous to claim that is a more egalitarian system. Actually the people that are born after 2140 (when all bitcoin has been mined) will be at an advantage because the money supply is not increasing as it is today. Mining is not something that people can make a lot of money at. It's an extremely low margin business. I'm not sure why you're so obsessed with it being this awesome thing to do.

I think you are underestimating the cost of having the knowledge to be able to see the potential in Bitcoin that early. Look at Hal Finney's (who was an early miner in 2009) background. He worked on PGP and build his own version of crypto before btc. Or Trace Mayer, who was doing academic research on money when Bitcoin came out. I mean, these guys dedicated their lives to obtaining the knowledge required to be able to see this. They were also somewhat lucky to be born at the right time/place for it and other things that happened in their lives. But that's just how the world works.

Here's a very interesting site that shows this in real time: 
Since interest rates are artificially low (due to quantitative easing and other methods), we are still able to make the payments, but if interest rates were at a more normal 7.5%, we'd be paying all of the tax revenue to interest, social security, medicare, and government pensions (all of which we can't stop doing without defaulting).

Accredited investors can arbitrage it because they can buy at the NAV, transfer the shares to GBTC and then sell at market. They also have to hold the shares for at least 12 months. The problem at the moment is that there is not enough liquidity because of the 12 month requirement which is why it's trading at such a high price. From what I understand COIN will not have this restriction, so it should come to equilibrium with the Bitcoin exchange price much more quickly.

It's only necessary if you want to eliminate the middleman. You can do everything that a centralized company does in a decentralized way on the blockchain for pennies. I've in fact seen proposals for a blockchain based version of stubhub. In terms of transfer of airline tickets I wasn't intending to design the entire system in reddit, but I don't see anything inherently impossible about transferring tickets. You'd just need a way to prove you are who you are independent of the blockchain ticket. We already do this today. When you check in, you show both an identification and your ticket. Sure, it requires changes in policy, but not technologically impossible. I do think the airlines would resist this though because they make a lot of money being the middleman.

| The main chain can't handle the number of transactions required for large-scale use. Side chains are the only answer...
Not true. There are a number of other proposals to deal with scaling. If you read the sidechain white paper, it's not really a scaling solution, it's a dev/test solution. They depend on merged mining. It means that in order to have any level of security you need probably around 80% of the miners on the network to mine your sidechain. So, basically it doesn't improve scalability at all because it just means that miners have to run some more software and still process all of the transactions if you want the same level of security. Some of the scaling solutions that have been proposed are:
1.) Off chain transactions (like what coinbase and change tip are doing today)
2.) IBLT - invertible bloom lookup table (proposed by Gavin)
3.) There's a really exciting proposal here:  which basically allows unlimited scaling.
4.) Just plain old increasing the block size (also proposed by Gavin)
Number 3 I think is the ultimate solution, but would require consensus and a hard fork.
What you are proposing does not solve the problem and is not easier to use.

The difference is that you can simultaneously connect to multiple neighbors (or providers) at the same time and you don't need to ask permission up front, it's all baked into the protocol. Pure competition on rates. There is also a new technology that is just emerging called super wifi which allows a wifi connection of up to 100km. So, that basically eliminates the last mile. How many potential connections do you think there is in the nearest 100km of the average person? You don't have to call up your neighbor and get an agreement with them or do anything like that. Their router would just advertise a rate and you'd connect to them and pay with bitcoin using payment channels. It's not extremely different, but it just allows peer to peer payments and you can connect no matter where you are without asking permission. If one of your neighbors blocks sites they consider immoral, you would just route around it. Your modem (or phone, or whatever device), would just always be negotiating with "Bitcoin ISPs" wherever you go, which include your neighbors, providers, etc. All that you'd need to do is put bitcoin into your connection and you'd be able to connect to whatever you want to. Also, in terms of someone potentially trying to block a site, that is also resolved by a technology called I2P (Invisible internet protocol). I'm envisioning a future where basically all traffic goes through this protocol, so your neighbor would not have any idea what site you are looking at.

I disagree, cryptocurrencies do not need to 'evolve' into fiat currencies as he is proposing. We already have seen a whole bunch of them and everyone is free to use them and make new ones. We just want the freedom to not use them. The good news is that they won't evolve into that because no one would use a fork of bitcoin that allowed an individual to control the supply.

| Do tell how you'd handle transoceanic internet via peer mesh.
You handle them with payment channels. Your ISP today doesn't own transoceanic cables or satellites yet you still use them. If you need to use a network that goes over the ocean, your ISP would have to pay for usage of those networks (including transoceanic). This payment could be made through bitcoin seamlessly. There is a project by bit pay called Foxtrot that does just this. I should be more clear. I think there will still be companies that provide services, but you will not sign up with a single ISP, you'll just connect to whoever speaks the protocol and you'll be able to route to anywhere on the network using bitcoin is the payment mechanism. This is one of the most exciting possibilities of bitcoin actually.

All currency fluctuates in its exchange rate against other currencies. Bitcoin is in its infancy so it fluctuates more than older currencies. As time goes on that would be expected to change. Bitcoin has properties that will make it less volatile vs fiat currencies in the future. Namely, it does not allow for a central party to create additional units. Invariably, that feature of fiat currencies leads to hyperinflation. Todays fiat currencies will be no different, but this can never happen to bitcoin.

I don't see the evidence of that. I only know of three entities that employ core developers to work on Bitcoin full time: MIT (where Gavin, Vlad, etc work), Bitpay (Jeff Garzik), and BlockStream (most of the other core devs). Some core devs, like Peter Todd, are independent consultants. There are probably a few that I missed, but I think that's the majority that are employed to work on bitcoin full time. MIT is not even a corporation. Bitpay has stated they hold bitcoin on their balance sheet in the hopes of aligning their interests with Bitcoin itself and have made numerous contributions to open source. BlockStream's motto is "Can't be evil". I don't think the backers are interested in duplicating the current financial system with them as the new owners. From what I gather the idea is to free things up and offer more financial freedom so that their other investments will grow without the hindrance of the current oppressive banking system.

I think we need both payment channels and scaling of the blockchain. Consider for a moment if all 7 billion people on the planet were using bitcoin via payment channels. Using a payment channel requires two bitcoin transactions: one to open the channel and one to settle the channel. If everyone opened a single payment channel and settled once a month, and assuming a 300 byte average transaction size, you'd need a 1GB block size.  This does not even include all of the valuable use cases for writing data to the block chain (e.g. notary type transactions, etc). Even with payment channels, I don't see how we get by without a massively bigger block size.

I actually think non developers should let their desires be known. There's a difference between saying I want intermittent wipers vs. saying I want a particular set of resistors, transistors, and inductors. In the bitcoin world, the ask from users are things like: I want instant confirmations and lower transaction fees. When I say implementation details, what I mean is saying things like I want bigger blocks, etc. Those are implementation details and we should listen to the developers on this issue. They have spoken loud and clear and said we should go for segwit, schnorr signatures, and lightning network at this time. Not an increased block size.
In terms of Bitcoin being developed for developers. What I mean is that as a non developer, you will most likely not be coding bitcoin transactions yourself. Today, you would use a wallet like mycelieum, blockchain.info, or Coinbase, etc. The people who actually code the transactions are developers of those companies. In fact the developers at those companies probably also use libraries like bitcoinj which is yet another layer. Some day, the lightning network may be an additional layer. Just because their are layers in the tech, doesn't mean it can't be used world wide but bitcoin core is the lowest layer just as in networking most users don't worry about the details for their network card's device driver.

I understand what you are describing. I don't think your analogy works though. The problem is, lets say bitcoin price is $0.01. That means the block reward total block reward is $0.25 plus transaction fees which at the moment are insignificant. This means that in a day, the bitcoin miners as a whole earn $36 + transaction fees. That means there's not much money in mining so someone with a couple of asics could control more than 50% of the hashing power. If people on the network are regularly doing transactions with colored coins (e.g. a coin representing the mona lisa), it would be economically viable to try to control the network by purchasing more than 51% of hash power and doing double spends with some of these colored coins. The network would not be secure and therefore be worthless, even for trading assets that have value independent of the block chain. This exact thing happened with some alt coins. The price of bitcoin must be higher if it is to be useful in the way you are describing. There may be other assets traded on the blockchain, but bitcoin itself will act as the reserve currency in this scenario.

One form of broken is if mining is only taking place in a few data centers because then it would be trivial for someone to get control over and start censoring transactions.

It also means any btc we own is more valuable because  more of it would be needed to transact.

Im starting to think of this crowd as the "must hard fork at all cost crowd". They seem to want to hard fork in any way possible. The ethereum debacle only seems to embolden them to want to hard fork even more. They even want to hard fork if there is absolutely no reason to do so. They back it up by saying it's about end user choice but with segwit and schnorr the users will have the choice to use the old clients and there is really no downside from the average user to using these optimizations. You can trace the actions of these hard forkers back to March 11, 2013 when Mike Hearn introduced code that hard forked the network. Luckily Pieter Wuille and others acted within minutes to help miners go back to the old code and fix the bugs.

If you are saying its better to hold your private keys, I agree, but my point is that even if you have a bitcoin bank hold your bitcoin, you are still using Bitcoin. There is still a scenario where banks primarily hold people's bitcoin and they settle with each other each night. That system is better than the current system because the Bitcoin banks can prove reserves every 10 minutes so that you know there is no fractional reserves. It is way better than the current system and yes, things like lightning network improve on that vision.

I always see these statements about needing more core developers and I don't really know what to think. I'm not sure that we need more really. The main thing needed is side chains and/or tree chains. If you really start to think about it, everything else is possible outside of the core protocol and should be done there instead (especially at first). Another way to look at it is: how many core developers does TCP/IP have? How about HTTP or SMTP?

Yes, but keep in mind Ripple is pre-mined, so being on that list is somewhat questionable in my opinion. It should at least have an asterisks next to it. Here are the steps to setup a coin with a market cap of $1 trillion:
1.) Create Currency that is 100% pre-mined.
2.) Create Exchange
3.) Create sock puppet accounts
4.) Trade between sock puppet accounts at a level where the market cap is implied to be $1 trillion.

The reason trezor is safer than non hardware wallets is that it has an extremly low attack surface. See:

Sidechains are good because they allow us to take less risk than making the change to the main chain. So, there's no reason for anyone to object to a BIP100 sidechain or a BIP101 sidechain because no one is forcing you to use it and even if you do use it, you can limit your loss to the amount you put into the sidechain. Basically, they give us a way to experiment with things in a controlled environment.

I don't want to add a middleman. I'm talking about a secondary market. Currently, the airline is the middleman. They have to be between each trade. Let me give you an example: lets say I book a ticket for $500. At the last minute someone needs to buy a seat on my flight and even though the flight is fully booked, the airline will sell them a ticket for $3,000. The airline will then make an offer to any passengers to get them on the next flight (value of $500) plus a $500 voucher. The airline spends a total of $1000 for the ticket they sell for $3000. The airline (middleman) pockets the difference for $2,000. If there was a blockchain based market for the tickets on this airline, the person taking the voucher could ask for $1,500 that is paid directly from the person wanting to buy the last minute ticket. Therefore, both the buyer and the seller would get a better deal at the expense of the airline (the middleman).

bitcoin price is directly proportional to the security of the network because it relates to the amount of energy required to do a double spend or 51% attack. Doing large transactions on a insecure blockchain would not be a good idea. Using dollars on the blockchain would also require counterparty risk because someone has to guarantee that the one satoshi will really be exchangable for millions of dollars. Therefore, bitcoin as a currency has some inherent advantages over these types of things.

The difference between BIP47 and stealth addresses is that stealth addresses require a full node to be running with the wallet and BIP47 is compatible with SPV wallets. So it's likely that BIP47 will be implemented as opposed to stealth addresses since consumer wallets are generally speaking SPV.

There is this misnomer that Mike Hearn introduced that the sky is going to fall if the blocks fill up. He brought the capacity planning analogies into the debate. That's wrong. If they fill up, scarcity will cause price to go up. It is nothing like the analogies he made to gmail server capacity. That is total BS nonsense. Given that bitcoin is useful, we will inevitably hit that limit. I would rather see that happen sooner rather than later. But it will not kill bitcoin just force wallets to implement retries, and similar logic. Most core devs (that have submitted code recently) share this beleif.

Yes obviosly, but their motto is not "don't be evil", that is google. Blockstream's is "can't be evil". The idea is basically that they are only going to make software, not control private keys, data, etc. While over time I agree that anyone can be corrupted or co-opted, I think the point is they don't want to put themselves in a position where they can be coerced. While, I agree it remains to be seen, I think it's a stronger statement than " don't be evil" which actually tends to make me a little skeptical of someone who says it. At this point, all blockstream is doing is working on the side chain proposal which would not give them any power to be evil as far as I can see.
@_date: 2016-01-30 05:03:13
I don't get your logic. It's exactly the opposite of mine pretty much. The higher transaction fees, the more incentive there is to use lightning network. Same for Segwit. I don't really see a meaningful competitor of bitcoin. Also, blocks are not filling up. Of the last 10 blocks,  6 of them were less than half full. I'll take Jeff Garzik's definition of a fee event being 95%+ full blocks for a week. I also don't think it will take very long for block size to go up after a fee event because it will be profitable for miners to raise the block size at that point.
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:09:01
If he means the core protocol, I don't think there's too much we need to change other than larger block size, side chainschains possibly tree chains and bug fixes. No one will profit directly from this but its vital. In terms of basic wallet functionality I agree with him. We need hardware wallets + payment channels + coin join + stealth addresses + multisig. I can't wait for that in a usable device that's the size of a credit card.

The good thing about having a high threshold is that it's harder to change. I don't want bitcoin to change much personally. For instance, I don't want the 21m cap to ever be put on the table.

It's pretty clear to see that he's right that bitcoin has an economy that is independent of national economies (i.e. Silk Road and all the other dark markets). I guess the real question is: will that economy spread to other sectors beyond things that are illegal? There are certainly some incentives for that to happen. On the black market, there's no income taxes, workers comp, sales taxes, regulatory compliance, minimum wage, business licenses, attorney fees, etc, etc. If bitcoin can build the solutions around trust that the state offers the bitcoin economy will grow much larger.

This kind of misrepresents the difference between hard and soft forks. Complexity of change is irrelevant. The difference is that with hard forks, miners that upgrade will be on a different blockchain from the miners that don't upgrade and soft forks, upgrading is optional - there remains a single blockchain. The actual change for either one may be 'major' or 'minor'. An example of a major change that is a soft fork is side chains and tree chains. That's because not all miners need to recognize these features for them to be used. Just some miners have to accept them to be able to use them. This is also like OP_RETURN which is why transactions involving OP_RETURN take longer than normal transactions. This proposed hard fork, I would argue, is extremely minor in terms of complexity, but it's still a hard fork. The only change to code is literally a constant but as soon as a block &gt; 1MB is solved the old code would reject it and the new code would accept it (thus a hard fork that creates two blockchains). The ultimate winner is the chain that gets &gt; 50% of the hashing power on the network.

Not true, the federal reserve can print money at will (or create it electronically). Also, banks can create money through fractional reserve banking. In any case my point was that we're comparing apples to oranges. Bitcoin has OPTIONAL transaction fees (typically about $0.02 flat fee) which can be compared to visa's 3% transaction fees. The mining reward is more similar to the increasing of the monetary base by the fed and fractional reserve banking.

I'm not seeing why you don't think this is a technical decision. Sure a bunch of the Mike Hearn crowd (many of whom are probably covertly on the payroll of the banks or their allies, as Hearn turned out to be) have made this political, but the fact remains that Segwit will increase the effective block size by nearly a factor of 2 and also enable lightning network. When were on the verge of such an increase, why do we all of a sudden need to hard fork? I'm just not getting the argument there. Can't we wait until April when we get a much larger capacity? Segwit + LN will surely buy us a year if not more before we hit the cap and by then we can have things like weak blocks, thin blocks, iblt, etc. That will put us in a position that is much better to do a hard fork. That's not even to mention things like shnorr signatures which can compress the data in blocks even more. There is truly a massive amount of things we can do to optimize before we hit the cap. Why take the lazy way out and raise the cap without exhausting optimizations? About Adam: he proposed 2-4-8 before he knew about the segwit soft fork. There was a lot of stuff that came out of the scaling conferences that are way better than raising block sizes.

Not with bidirectional channels (segwit is needed). With bidirectional channels, lets say you have $5,000 in the channel as long as you never exceed $5,000 balance you'll never have to do an onchain txn. I realize that you may have to occasionally add funds, but it's going to be rare. Maybe if you get a new job that pays more or something. Twice every 10 years seems reasonable to me.

Armory is fine, but you need to protect against the same things with it as you do with a paper wallet. There were some pictures earlier of a fire that destroyed three computers in the same house.


The M of N thing is neat, but bip38 is effectively a 2 of 2 because you need both the password and the key to access them so to me it's overkill to go beyond 2 of 2. It might be useful if you have a situation where you have multiple people that can use the wallet (like an organization), but multisig is better than the shamir's secret implementation that armory does, but I haven't seen a good implementation for offline signing of multi-sig transactions yet. For just storing personal bitcoins, I think 2 of 2 (as implemented with bip38) is fine. You just need to print out three copies of the password and three copies of the wallet and store them in different places. Then losing 2 of 3 of the password and 2 of 3 of the wallet are safe and as long as no one person (other than yourself) has access to the key and the password, you're safe. Also, last time I was looking at Armory the shamir's secret (M of N) implementation said it's still beta and didn't reccommend using it for large amounts of bitcoins yet which is why I didn't use it (it's possible it's ready now, but that made me a little nervous at the time I made my paper wallets). Armory also doesn't use the standard bip38 so you can only use Amory to deal with your bitcoins which is a big deal. bip38 is widely supported by many wallets. The signing of offline transactions is nice, but you can import a key to armory to do offline transactions (which I was looking into doing next time I need to move from one paper wallet to another, but it's kind of a pain to setup in the offline/online mode so I just held off on that).

Good read, but I guess I don't get the urgency to hard fork now. We are scheduled to get Segwit (1.7x - 2x capacity increase) in April. It will also enable Lightning Network. At that point there is a massive amount of scaling work that can be done outside of core to optimize things at the wallet level (implementing segwit and lightning network support in wallets and in things like openbazaar). Why not optimize there while we can improve core more with something like Xtreme Thinblocks? Once those enhancements are implemented in core, we can do a hard fork up to maybe like the 2-4-8 proposal.

What I did was to download two wallets that support BIP39 backups. I happened to use mycelium and wallet32, but any will do. When you create the second wallet choose restore and enter the seed from your first wallet. Then, transfer a small amount to the first wallet. Then ensure you see it in the second wallet. Once you've confirmed you backup works and have stored a copy of your backup, you can use this wallet more freely, but remember that these are hot wallets at all times so only spending money should be used this way. For larger amounts use a paper wallet or a hardware wallet.

I probably should have been more clear. I was mostly disagreeing with "a prudent investor can be forgiven for preferring to sit on the sidelines.". I think that it makes sense to buy bitcoin for the long term regardless of what happens in the short term wrt block size debate. Actually it's better to buy before a fork because then you have both sides of the fork (assuming you intend to be a long term holder). In terms of better communication, in general I would agree with you that more communication is better, but I think there have been at least some communications about core's position and it's a tradeoff between having core devs explaining their case on Reddit and other social media and coding. Coding should probably be higher priority in my opinion. If you watch some of Adam Back's interviews on bitcoin.kn (with Trace Mayer), I think you will see that there's some very good information presented there and to me he has communicated the general vision very clearly. Part of what I try to do personally is to post on Reddit to try to explain what I see coming from a person that has an engineering/management background to possibly save some of the core devs some time posting on Reddit so that they can continue to code. I have no idea whether it's effective or not, but at least that's my attempt at a contribution.

@_date: 2016-01-23 16:01:29
The thing is that the users who say they want a block increase to 2mb, or 8mb, or 8gb. What they actually want is more transaction throughput. But users also want decentralization. Users also want anonymity. Users also want extensibility. I think core's approach to these problems is more ambitious than just raising the blocksize, but they are listening to the customer, just coming to a different conclusion about how to do that.

The problem is really what's referred to as the "last mile" connection problem and also that ISPs are a single point of failure. It doesn't mean ISPs do not work, they do just long term, this is the direction that it appears things are moving. See bitmesh for the first step: 


It's also a first step. Basically most of the good spectrum is used for TV channels (unbelievable) and the wireless carriers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, etc). These are essentially government regulated monopolies. When this spectrum is reallocated to something like super wifi the speeds will be much faster. Also, you're thinking about a single connection. What if you connect to 10 20mbps connections at the same time. Ultimately, this is just a better design.


This is not really an either/or situation. You might still choose to have a wired connection and you will probably benefit by reselling the bandwidth you are not using to your neighbors to make their connections more efficient. You are not constantly using 100mbps 24/7, so you can share your connection with neighbors for a fee and possibly completely subsidize your bill. Maybe when you're downloading a file you use both your 100mbps connection and a couple of other neighbor's connections at the same time.


Again, we're not talking about having a single connection. I'm talking about new hardware that connects to multiple connections at the same time including your wired connection. You won't even notice or think about what's going on or pick a connection that will automatically be taken care of for you. If one of them is going slow, or goes down, you will be routed around it. Most streaming video will move to something like bittorrent in the future as well so you can be streaming video from multiple locations at the same time. In terms of savings, this introduces competition and optimizes things and I would expect would significantly reduce the cost of bandwidth overall. Many people would probably get their internet completely subsidized by sharing their connection.
This is very similar to what is happening in multiple industries right now. For instance: AirBNB or Uber: you could say there was no problem with taxis or hotels, but we're talking about allocating resources more efficiently. That's why these two companies have multiple billion dollar valuations. You couldn't really do this sort of thing with internet connections yet because there was no peer to peer payment system with this kind of efficiency. Bitcoin enables this.

My theory on the halvening is that it is not priced in. If you look at the period before the last halvening  (late 2012), you will see parallels to today. There was no instant impact of the halvening, but within one year, we were up 100x. I suspect we'll see something similar this tme around (no instant move, but within a year a large move), but of course not as dramatic a rise as last time.
@_date: 2016-01-30 02:45:03
Hitting the block size limit is the storm in your analogy. The problem is: that storm will come eventually. Even if we keep putting it off by raising the block limit periodically, we can't avoid the inevitable. The more we push it out, the more centralized the system becomes. If we give in once, people will demand we give in again and again just like the debt ceiling debate. This is why while we're still young, we should allow the storm to hit and weather it. We'll build shelter by encouraging efficient use of the blockchain (SegWit and Lightning Network) and through this adversity, we'll have a stronger system than if the storm never hit. Also, this is not much of a strom. It just means users don't get free transactions anymore, you just have to pay for them and the market will raise the limit after we hit the limit.

kyc/AML is not a concern if you are anonymous.  Since you are vc backed, you could end up competing with nodes that may be less concerned about that sort of regulation than you are. In terms of being capital intensive, I suppose, but if that's the only barrier to entry you will be competing with others for low margins. Just looks like a race to the bottom to me when you could be working on high margin things like merchant tools, support, education, etc based your competitive advantage of knowing the system.

The issue I have with this line of thought is the notion that users somehow need to be protected from darknet markets so that they don't get scared off. This is a sophism. People are responsible for their own decisions and choices. Filtering technology  (e.g. NSFW, etc) can be used to resolve any perceived risks. On the other hand if there is a technical reason (e.g. let's get an initial version out) why it's been deprioritized that makes sense to me.

This paper only assumes half of the block will be used for transactions. Also, it ignores schnorr signatures aggregation which can be used in conjunction with coinjoin. That would approximately triple the throughput. So you'd only need about 45 mb blocks. Also, I think two transactions per year is too high. Opening a LN channel is like opening a bank account most people don't open two bank accounts per year. 2 tx per 10 years might be more realistic. That brings us to 4.5 mb blocks. Which also means we can support 1 billion users with segwit/schnorr as the only changes.

Several reasons:
1.) Increases in the blocksize without the tech to increase scalability (e.g. IBLT, weak blocks, thin blocks, etc) will cause increased centralization. It's a tradeoff and there are modes where bitcoin works even with larger fees. (Changetip is an example of this where transactions are done off chain).
2.) Even if we increase the limits, we will eventually hit the limits. If you look at all the worlds transactions (including credit cards, debit, cash transactions, esp when you get into settling stock trades which can be done WAY better on the blockchain) you are getting to the point where even tens to hundreds of gigabytes won't support the transaction levels that are theoretically possible. I don't see a scenario where we keep raising the block size fast enough and not hit the limit without over centralization. So, the question is would we rather hit that limit sooner or later? For me, as a Bitcoin holder, I'd rather hit that limit sooner and force solutions while we're still relatively young. Imagine if we pushed it out say 10 years from now and Bitcoin was the world reserve currency with a market cap of $20 trillion. Then it would be incredibly risky to do. I'd rather see it happen in the next 6 - 12 months when we're still not on everyone's radar. I think that's what the core devs are seeing as well.

If that is their dream, it's a misguided one. Perfect anonymity in the form of coin shuffle will come with time.


I'm not sure how it would be enforced, but even if green address is used the green address provider cannot do much. They can refuse all transactions in which case you get your money back when a certain time period expires. If green address started doing that, a competitor that offers the same service would crop up. It's basically just a way to prevent double spends by introducing minimal trust.


That's a lot better than the current system where a corporation that has unknown shareholders can create unlimited money at will and banks can create money for loans on demand as well. Satoshi's intentions seem benevolent, but even if malevolent, he cannot control things indefinitely.

The description of how the notary function works was mangled a bit. In OB, there is a notary function that can be used to add someone who will settle disputes in case of the buyer and seller don't agree. For a normal transaction, this doesn't come into play. They use a 2 of 3 multisig script to provide this function. The cool thing is that as long as you don't have a dispute, its free. If there is a problem, the notary can also not do anything without the signature of either the buyer or seller, so it's impossible for them to steal funds. This is pretty exciting because there is no such type of escrow available today.

Actually the scenario you described would not be that bad for miners because today miners compete with 100% of the other miners and in the future scenario you describe, more than 50% would be mining on another chain but the miners still on the bitcoin chain would win just as frequently (in a time sense) as they did before. If sometimes some of the old miners come back it doesn't affect their profitability at all. The only affect would be that confirmation times would speed up or slow down when the miners enter/leave the system. Since we are going to a settlement model with layer 2 on top, this doesn't really matter all that much actually.

ETF is different than ETN. The key difference is that the ETF will have a feedback mechanism whereby an authorized participant(s) will be able to exchange bitcoin for shares and vice-versa. This is big because it means that anyone with a brokerage account can indirectly place orders onto the bitcoin exchanges through the ETF. Can you imagine George Soros or another big player placing orders to buy $1b of bitcoin? There would be no bitcoin left on the exchanges in short order.

I'm not getting it. Why wouldn't we all want to transact on the main chain? All a subchain does is make you incompatible and less secure than the main chain. If there's a specific feature that you need, then a sidechain makes sense, but not just for the sake of having a different chain. ISPs are probably the weakest link in the internet because they introduce a source for censorship. I'm hoping bitcoin will make ISPs obsolete actually through wireless mesh networking between peers.

All that I would say about a 2mb cap (right now) is that it delays a fee event. It will keep us in the mode where we have excess capacity longer. I personally think it's better to wait until the blocks fill up and then raise to something higher. If we get in the habit of raising the block size before a fee event, everyone will get used to it and never expect us to hit the limit or never have an incentive to use other layers (e.g.lightning network). One thing I could potentially understand is a temporary increase because things like LN are not ready. However, I don't see that as a major problem because as of April Segwit buys us more time and were not full quite yet, so it seems to me there's a long enough runway.

There would be tiers of transactions, you'd have standard transactions that all nodes understand which would be very expensive. The old nodes would be able to understand them. Then, there'd be a second layer (maybe 10 mb) extension block which is cheaper. Then maybe a third layer which is 100 mb that is cheapest. You'd either have to have an updated node or use an svp node to transact on the additional layers. You can do this and not interfere with people who don't want to upgrade / change the network yet new users can also get what they want.

Let's see if we can figure this out:
1.) Mike Hearn joins R3 (banker consortium to replace bitcoin)
2.) Mike Hearn writes childish hit piece bashing btc. That says btc price will go down.
3.) btc price starts going down.
To me it's obvious that this sequence of events are not a coincidence. The bankers have been convicted of manipulating libor rates, the gold market, currency markets. So to think they're above manipulating bitcoin is folly.

All the exchanges have said if there is more hash power on the BU chain for a relevant amount of time they will call it bitcoin. Ethereum does not use sha256 so the hardware that Bitmain has would not work on Ethereum. Bitmain is kind of stuck with sha256, at least with their current hardware. No alt coins that use sha256 are even close to bitcoin and it's basically impossible to compete with bitcoin on sha256 because a couple of miners can destroy your chain. It happened a couple of times. That's why the alt coins now use a different POW (e.g. X11, Script, etc).

I don't see a distinction between checkings/savings in bitcoin. I know people frequently talk about it, but it just doesn't translate to me. Savings implies interest which is not applicable in Bitcoin.


Like I said you would probably exceed an initial balance at some point, but it's unlikely to happen that often. Take for example the case where your employer pays you $1000 bimonthly. Your employer might fund the channel with an initial $5000 with $1000 allocated to you and $4000 allocated to the employer. Then, each following paycheck, they allocate an additional thousand dollars. But, you would also be spending money from this channel as you go. That means that for at least 5 months, there are no onchain transactions, but likely much longer. It's highly unlikely to me that a person making $1000 twice a month will be able to save more than $5000 in a year. It's not like you never can exceed your initial balance, but it may take a few years. Like I said, maybe twice every 10 years seems like a reasonable frequency to me.

Depends on the product as well as the developer. If you're talking about a product where developers are the customer (like Linux and bitcoin considering it's likely to be a lower layer of a bigger system.) I think the developers have a valid opinion. Also, I tend to think the developers in this case understand the system and what it needs to do. Equally dangrous in my experience is when non developers try to influence implementation details. I beleive that is what is happening in Bitcoin.

From what I understand, they are working on a decentralized exchange and need LN (or similar) to implement it. There are many other companies that need LN in order for their use case. It's not some kind of conspiracy where they will controll all the hubs on LN and jack up the price as I've seen over on the other sub. LN is a race to the bottom.

I disagree with this assertion. As a long term holder (not interested in selling for 5 - 10 years plus), I believe the most prudent course of action is the one proposed by bitcoin core in their scalability road map. Within a few months we'll have about 1.6 - 1.7 x capacity without risking a hard fork. Then, by the end of the year we'll have IBLTs and weak blocks. Even if we see a modest increase in fees during that time, I think we're in good shape long term with those improvements and things like lightning network.
@_date: 2016-03-02 12:44:16
About becoming  a payment hub: while you could do that, I'd imagine that would not be a very good business model because you'd be competing with other nodes in the system as a provider of a commodity.

I disagree with this. BU is a piece of shit. What value does the Bitcoin network have of it is based on a piece of shit? Not only do they refuse to take in a maleability bug fix, (which enables LN and true scaling) but they have MANY bugs in the few lines of code that they added to a version of core that is several revs behind the core branch. The most recent bug is in a feature (xthin blocks) which is totally not necessary and is inferior to compact blocks (which addresses the real issue which is avoiding multiple round trips while transmitting blocks by using udp and was released in a subsequent version of core). The fact that Jihan/Roger can't see this is completely redicoulas.

Unlimited block size ultimately means that you end up in a situation where as the block reward goes to zero, miners can mine the entire mempool. If a miner mined the entire mempool, other miners have an incentive to orphan the other miners blocks. Bitcoin thus becomes unstable. The only solution is to keep a perminent block reward. Then we no longer have a 21 m bit coin fixed supply. So, ultimately no block size means no 21m limit.

This is exactly what I was describing in my posts. As I said, "The funding transaction is kind of like the 1 lane on ramp in the analogy.". My point is that you remove the majority of onchain transactions from the blockchain with LN and do them offchain so this onramp has a lot more space in it for the relatively small number of funding transactions and node switching transactions. You are not "ignoring" it as OP said you're moving the majority of transactions off of it.


I agree with this. With 1mb blocks and LN + Segwit + Schnorr signatures, we can probably get to something like 1,000 - 100,000 transactions per second. (This is using Adam Back's estimates of the improvements). While that's not enough for all the world's transactions it's at least close to VISA scale and probably a lot greater than VISA scale at the medium to higher end of the estimates. If we plan to do every single transaction in the world on the blockchain we probably need a higher block size. The other option is to create sidechain(s) with larger block sizes and do the majority of small transactions via LN on a sidechain.
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:31:05
Where the analogy breaks down is that the so called 1 lane onramp is currently being used both as an onramp and the main thoroughfare. By adding this 12 lane highway you can exclusively use the one lane to get onto the thoroughfare. You can think of the doing on chain transactions as opening a bank account and the thoroughfare as doing wire transfers and bill pay. The estimates are that the LN will scale the system by 100 - 10,000X.
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:41:33


Ugh.....this is so intellectually dishonest. LN makes it so you have to do fewer on-chain transactions and OB should embrace it instead of making bad analogies. I wish they would move beyond the block size debate and start thinking about how to optimize OB for the block size that we have. Joseph Poon documented how a 2 of 3 multisig transaction can be done on LN which can be used to implement OB's arbitrator model. This would be a huge breakthrough if OB implemented it. Without that, I don't see how OB scales to the levels needed.
@_date: 2016-01-28 08:33:12
Yeah, I'm just kind of trying to illustrate that bitcoin is only automation around the transfer of proof of works. Just like OpenBazaar is only automation around a decentralized market place.

It's not nessisarily the longest chain, it's the chain with the most work. If there was a fork that used a new hashing algorithm, the current mining would definitely stay on the old network, so not sure what it means to say who 'wins' since there will without a doubt be two chains. It really depends how much people desire the coins from each chain. I suppose the winner is the more in demand chain.

Ok, I see where you are coming from with the $0.50. But if fees get that high, which I doubt, it will be because bitcoin has a lot of valuable use cases to a lot of people. For people using it as a replacement for VISA, no it won't have value. For me personally, I'm using bitcoin as a store of value so I wouldn't care if the transaction fees were $1 or $5 even. But if they did get that high I wouldn't use bitcoin to buy my coffee. I would however use lightning network. I don't think bitcoin will be adopted by people that are hoping to save fees on credit card transactions. It will be adopted by people in countries that have failing currencies like Venezuela, or drug dealers, or prostitutes, or people who want to buy cancer drugs for their relatives on the black market because they can't afford it or people who want to gamble online. The fees won't matter to these people, but lightning network will make it cheap if fees are even $1, they can enter into the lightning network for a $1 and do tens or hundreds of transactions and thus we'd have gone full circle and had low fees again.

I'm not sure how we can realistically avoid a fee market eventually if Bitcoin is widely used for day to day transactions of people around the world. Bitcoin is a broadcast network so you need some way to limit the number of onchain transactions. What's the alternative to a fee market?


With lightning network, you only have to do onchain transactions very rarely mostly for the funding transactions. Once you have a few channels open you might not even need to do any onchain transactions for months or even years. The cost of lightning network off chain transactions will be negligible. Joseph Poon has argued that they will be around 1 satoshi. I suspect they will be free as large network participants like miners, merchants and exchanges will benefit from free LN transactions and it's a very cheap service to provide so it would make sense for them to run LN nodes as a loss leader.

The things you mentioned have to do with requirements of the banking system (aml/kyc), not bitcoin. So, the reason you have to do those things is due to regulations. I have not experienced those kind of things with coinbase or circle, so you might want to look into those services.


It doesn't display a weakness in bitcoin. It's a weakness with the bridges from fiat to bitcoin which are heavily regulated.
In terms of making it easy, like I said, try coinbase or circle. The point I was trying to make though is that I think people will switch to it out of necessity as opposed to switching to it willingly.

LN will allow for 100 - 10,000X scaling of from the current levels based on Adam Back's numbers in his presentation on scaling bitcoin. The point that was made in the paper is that even though it allows for a massive amount of scaling, there will still be a need to increase the block size if we want everyone in the world to use bitcoin for all the worlds transactions on the main chain.
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:44:06

This is why LN fees go to 0-1 satoshi per hop. The 1 satoshi is only it proves necessary for spam prevention. There will be hardware devices that make the LN nodes highly secure. Large holders of Bitcoin will have an incentive to operate these nodes for free because the increased value of Bitcoin due to free (or very low cost) txns clearly outweighs the cost of operating these nodes. Add in the fact that anyone, anywhere in the world can undercut their competition and the picture becomes even more clear.

You keep making these accusations with nothing to back it up. All I'm doing is quoting his slide. How is that not objective?


Why would we build a system that we know will self destruct in the future? Fees go to near zero long before that as well and the model will collapse a lot sooner than 123 years.


Yes, of course we know a fee market will emerge. The people pushing BU don't want that. Listen to Roger Ver's (and others) talks. He thinks blocks should have never been allowed to be full.
@_date: 2016-06-18 08:22:13
Have you read the lightning network paper? If not, I'd highly suggest reading it. I think it will probably explain it better than I can through Reddit. It might take a few times reading through it to fully understand how it works. I know it did for me. Basically, the point I'm trying to make that doesn't seem to be getting across is that the LN will allow you to do a single bitcoin transaction (funding transaction). After that is done any number of subsequent transactions can be done off chain back and forth between the participants. The funding transaction is kind of like the 1 lane on ramp in the analogy. I assume that's what OP meant in his blog post. But once you do that single transaction, you could do many more transactions off chain to pay other people on the network. That's what I believe he meant by the 12 lane highway. He seems to be claiming that there is still a bottleneck because you have to do a funding transaction to get onto the LN 12 lane highway. I don't think that's fair because basically the 12 lane highway operates totally independently of the 1 lane on ramp in the LN model. Basically you are clearing all the day to day transactions of participants in LN off of the main chain and thus leaving your on ramp to be only needed when you are creating the funding transactions. The funding transactions are fairly rare which is why it allows for a lot of scaling. That's why people are estimating 100-10,000X scaling and no one except OP is discussing this "onramp" problem. That is why I think the analogy, which implies there's some sort of bottleneck for the funding transactions is misleading. In lightning network, on chain transactions are mainly done when you want to join the lightning network. That is why I said it's like opening a bank account which is also like joining the banking network. Once you've opened your channel you can use it indefinitely to do day to day spending transactions with anyone else on the lightning network. In terms of wire fees, LN will be extremely cheap (we're talking 1 satoshi or less) because there's competition between lightning nodes and no significant costs to operating them. Large miners, exchanges, merchants, and other users will be willing to run LN nodes for free as a loss leader in order to enable things like micro-transactions which are beneficial to the whole ecosystem. So you aren't going to be paying wire fees at all or if you do it would be like a satoshi or two. Nothing is being limited by artificial constraints, the constraints are very real. Bitcoin is a broadcast network and even if we increase the block size significantly, we're not going to be able to get all the worlds transactions to fit into this broadcast network. If I buy a cup of coffee, the whole world doesn't need to know about it, they just need to know that no one created bitcoins above and beyond the 21 million. That's exactly what the lightning network does. It allows us to make sure the entire map of bitcoins in existence are consistent, while not requiring us to notify every participant in the network of a transfer.

That is normal and doesn't affect whether or not LN will be useful to you. Think of the LN as a massive graph. You can send or receive payment from anyone in the graph, not just the people you are directly connected to.


The coins are not locked up because you can use them to pay anyone else in the graph. Even if the person you want to pay is not yet on the graph, you can do a normal bitcoin transaction to release the funds from LN and pay whomever you want to pay just like you would with a traditional Bitcoin transaction.


There are many answers to this question, but the most basic answer is anyone who is currently using Bitcoin.
You seem to not be understanding the concept that LN is a graph where anyone can pay anyone else as long as both are connected to this graph. You seem to only see it as a payment channel between two parties. That's not what it is. I'd suggest reading the LN white paper if you haven't already or watching some of the presentations by people like Joseph Poon.

Why not? We do that with SSL. TCP/IP doesn't have any built in anonymity, but SSL works just fine and it's on top. HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc are all on top of TCP/IP.


Not true. Coinjoin and in particular coinshuffle is very good. In addition there is Confidential Transactions (which exists on a sidechain already). These are basically perfect anonymity.


Not really. The joinmarket is already here. Improvements can be made and it needs to be incorporated into wallet software so that it's easier to use, but it does work just fine.

Yes, your brokerage account will let you buy shares of GBTC, but you can only buy shares that an AP has brought into existence.

I don't want to be rude, but yes I think you do not understand what LN actually is. I suggest you read the white paper.


There is no special hardware requirement to run an LN node so it will be less centralized than mining which requires highly specialized chips. This is the draw to LN.


No I'm not. See last comment and again read the LN white paper or watch one of the videos on Youtube where Joseph Poon describes it.


No, that's not how LN works. You seem to be describing something like Coinbase where they allow you to transfer balances from account user 1, to account user 2. That's not what LN is at all. Again, read the paper.

This brings up the question: does anyone "own" bitcoin? I mean you can control bitcoin by knowing a private key, but do you really own it? Who "owns" bitcoin of its in a 2 of 3 multisig? Can corporations own bitcoin or is it owned by the people that know the keys? What if more than one person knows a private key? Which one is the owner? It's not as simple as people are making it out to be.

You should admit that your predictions were wrong. They are wrong now and will be wrong in 18 months even if the price is above $1000 at that time. I also think the price of bitcoin will be higher than $1000 in 18 months.

I agree with you on lightning. I think we also start to see the first group of apps on LN (e.g. distributed storage app, something like steemit for bitcoin which uses LN, bitcoin wifi which uses LN). The other thing we see is more forks. Procedures for collecting these "fork dividends" become common place and bitcoiners benefit.

As long as work is required for obtaining the commodity, it can be used as money. Salt is a good example. Salt was used as money in many locations. It's very easy to go to the ocean, evaporate sea water and obtain salt, but it requires work and thus gives the salt value. No issues whatsoever.

@_date: 2017-01-25 08:04:37
I was actually hoping that fees go to around $1. The thing is that we need to eventually have the fees replace the mining subsidy if we want bitcoin to work in the long term. Currently blocks contain around 2000 transactions.  With segwit and schnorr signatures, we're looking at around 6000 transactions. With $1 fees, that means miners would get around 6.5 btc in fees. After the next halvening the block reward will be 6.25 btc so we'd be at parity. In terms of your $3 transaction, that will be done on layer 2 tech like lightning network. You will only need to do an onchain transaction very infrequently. Think of it kinda like a fee you pay to open a bank account. Your probably not going to do them more than once per year.

@_date: 2017-08-23 13:25:01
Legal action is something the block chain needs to defend against as well so I don't see the distinction you are making about it. Also, the way that the block chain defends itself is through the incentives of the users. If users have an incentive to file lawsuits, they will do so. Thee question is: are the outcomes of those lawsuits in line with the incentives of the network or not. That's TBD and we'll see.

The early adopters serve an important purpose. They are the ones who promote the currency and explain it to people so they are creating value. There weren't a whole lot of people in 2009-10 who were mining but those that were were probably fairly clued in and they promoted bitcoin to the point where it is today. But what will they eventually do with their bitcoin? They will buy things from people who create the most value. They can't create money out of thin air though as can be done today.

I think this is right but and the catalyst might be either litecoin starts rising rapidly due to segwit/lightning adoption and/or ethereum classic overtakes ethereum. The former proves the viability of segwit and the latter proves that contentious hard forks (BU) are too risky.
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:41:45
Given the improvements coming: Segwit, Schnorr, LN, possibly some kind of coin join or equivalent, which all work together, there may not be a need for onchain scaling until 2024. So, this might be a reasonable proposal.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:56:02
It's becoming clear to me that any time there is a bitcoin proposal that has winners and losers, there will be a fork of the chain. Actually segwit is an example of this. The miners who were doing asicboost were the main losers and sure enough a fork happened. The more attractive chain will win out. I'm not too scared of a quantitative easing chain because I can't see it having much value. But we'll see.
@_date: 2017-01-29 08:27:10
It can be done with a soft fork. See

@_date: 2016-11-26 21:22:42
The intention is that your wallet would make this totally transparent to you. All you would need to do is use an updated wallet that implements LN and you would then use it exactly the same way. You may also chpose to use a payment processor like bitpay who would deal with all of this for you.

Im not arguing that there's no changes. I'm just saying that a good interface is easier to use. Power money scenario is essentially our current online banking with bitcoin backing so it would be even more familiar to most people than bitcoin. LN also has some advantages as you can get instant settlement which is not possible in bitcoin today.
@_date: 2016-11-09 20:23:25
Nice thought, but Bitcoin is not even close to being a global reserve currency at this point.
@_date: 2016-11-24 08:54:05

LN does not require you to open a payment channel for every single transaction. Why does it take nerve to tell you to read the white paper? Have you read it? If so, how did you miss the entire concept of what it's for and how it works?
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:10:17
Yes, I'm not criticizing hashcash. I'm just trying to say it doesn't take anything away from Bitcoin because it is not a global payment system itself. Therefore, this idea that saying that bitcoin is hashcash + inflation control is belittling Bitcoin is not accurate.

I was tracking the DAO a bit. From what I understood the main problem was a bug in the DAO which caused it to operate in a way that was different than what the participants thought so I'm not sure if it has many lessons for Bitcoin about consensus.


There are some options that don't require any changes for bitcoin at all. Despite what some say, lightning network works without segwit just not as efficient. Also, Tumblebit. Then there's always Nick Szabo's statement that Bitcoin may become a high powered money used for settlements which is what could possibly happen if this stalemate is not broken. We could end up using bitcoin banks that settle with each other on occasion.

Actually, LN should be able to scale to visa levels with the current block size (plus segwit improvements, schnorr signatures, and coinjoin). Adam Back gave a presentation where he stated that Schnorr signatures + segwit gets us about 3X-4X capacity increase. If everyone used coinjoin with Schnorr, you'd get to 4X+. Current capacity is about 3 TPS. So, with those improvements without LN, you're already at about 12 TPS. Then, with LN, the estimate is that it will allow approximately 100-10,000X scaling. So, even on the lower level, you're over 1,000 TPS and on the higher end, you're at 100,000 TPS. The numbers I've seen for VISA are around 2,000 sustained TPS and peaks of around 10,000 or so. LN would put us in that ballpark at least if not much higher even without a hardfork.

You could compare bitcoin to the federal reseve system as an example. Fedwire (the system banks use to settle with one another) has less than 10,000 participants but the total value of all money in the US banking system is much greater than the total value of all bitcoin. Therefore there is an example of a system with far fewer participants than bitcoin that has much greater value. In fact, I would venture to guess that every central bank has fewer participants than bitcoin yet in almost all cases has a greater value.

That was probably their plan. Their hashrate has been dropping though so we'll see what they have the power to do.

I'm not certain about anything, but I'm just saying what I think is right. I could ask you the same thing to you, how do you derive such certainty? I'm not the one who wants to change things dramatically. I actually think Bitcoin as is will work just fine. It would be nice to get segwit and sidechains but they are not necessary to preserve Bitcoin as a store of value which should be the most important thing. So, you're accusing me of sacrificing something that works when I'm doing the exact opposite. I'm being much more conservative than the reckless big block supporters like yourself.

Yes I get that if a hash is reused that we have problems because you have to reveal the hash. But what I'm proposing is that the hash that's used for a transaction not be randomly choosen. Instead, the purchaser would choose the next unused hash from the dht and mark it as used. Then the following purchaser would know to pick an unused hash for their transaction with the offline seller.

I read it the way you read. He says he's not blocking the malleability fix. He then says he's not convinced segwit is ________. So, it sounds like he wants a malleability fix but not segwit. Actually there are other malleability fixes that will allow for lightning network so in some sense I think this is a reasonable position although I personally prefer Segwit because it changes the incentives on using UTXOs and will thus decrease the growth of the UTXO set which is a scaling issue.
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:13:58
Pretty obvious this is an excuse. The real reason they are getting out of bitcoin is that they didn't understand it and made bad bets. There was no reason to use Circle for anything other than an on-ramp and they collect no fees for buying bitcoin. How did they expect to make money? I suppose that's core devs fault.
@_date: 2018-06-04 01:49:33
I think it's crazy to use cash in stores today. I only use cash when that's literally the only option, which happens like once a month or so for me. When I use credit cards, I get airline miles or other incentives that I don't get by using cash. I don't have to deal with change. I don't have to worry about getting diseases from handling money. So, yeah I think it's highly likely that in 5 years, a starbucks barrista will look at you strange for using cash. At some starbucks, in places where everyone uses credit cards, I suspect they look at people strangely for using cash today.

When people talk about bitcoin helping the poor, they are not talking about speculators making a quick buck. What they mean is that if bitcoin replaces the dollar as the world reserve currency there would be numerous benefits primarily due to the fact that it is a sound money. That would make things like financing wars difficult just as it was under the gold standard. It would also be difficult for governments to borrow the massive amounts of debts that cause their citizens to be enslaved.

A malicious buyer could reuse a hash, but the seller would then just not honor the transaction. As long as the dht kept track of when the hashes were marked as used and who used them, you'd know who was first and who intentionally reused a hash.

The segregated has nothing to do with payment channels. It has to do with the fact that the signatures are in a different part of the block (hence segregated). You're totally confusing multiple technologies.

It's no different than the situation today. Do you have any issues today using a credit card? Amazon has to be online for you to make payment, and they always are.

I don't know if it's the best we can do. I do happen to like it a lot. My point is that to have socialism (as I understand it), you need to use force to re-distribute wealth. Without that force and coercion, it all falls apart because very few people will voluntarily re-distribute their hard earned money to others who are not working. Given choice of two coins, one that re-distributes wealth and one that does not, people that are actually earning money will choose the former. That's where violence is necessary to redistribute the wealth and force people to use the coin that requires that.

There is very little true merchant adoption at the moment. The ones that do accept bit coin really actually are just hiring bit pay to act as a middleman and convert bit coin to fiat at time of Sale. In the future when merchants do start accepting bitcoin, if we have large blocks, we'll need a bit pay to run the expensive full node software. If we design the system correctly, merchants will be able to buy a cheap bitcoin payment gateway hardware and cut out the middlemen like bit pay altogether.
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:18:35
Bitcoin has had three super spikes so far. I believe we may be in (or just before) the fourth super spike. The other ones were in 2011, April 2013 and November 2013. In all cases, they rose about 5X in one month. After this massive rise, they all crashed by at least 80%. On July 16, we were at $1830 so 5X would be $9150. So, in the next few days, we could very well be at $9150. If that's the case, we'd expect an 80%+ pull back. The price would be around $1830. So, I would not be surprised if we see something like that happen.

I don't think bitcoin redistributes wealth at all. It is a proof of work. Miners burn energy to get bitcoin. Just like gold miners dig gold out of the earth. If we had a system based on bitcoin, there would be no way to enforce socialist redistribution of wealth. You were talking about a hypothetical blockchain that redistributes wealth maybe something like universal basic income I assumed. That would be a redistribution of wealth to me because you can obtain tokens without working. My point is, no one would want to participate in that blockchain unless you used force to make them participate. That is why I don't see how anarcho socialism works. In terms of the system you are building that's all fine and maybe some people wI'll use it, but I just don't see it being a dominant model when you can choose sound money like bitcoin or gold. THAT is unless someone forces people to use it.

If you want to compare Bitcoin to Gold, it would be better to look at Bitcoin's properties that are conducive to it being a form of money as opposed to looking at it's volatility or how it's perceived in the market today. There is a lot of information asymmetry at play here. Almost no one understands Bitcoin yet. There have been thousands of years for people to figure Gold out. I think a better way to compare the two is to look at how they stack up in terms of divisibility, fungibility, scarcity, portability, durability, and recognizability.
I would argue the Bitcoin is either equal or better than Gold in all of these categories (possibly with the exception of fungibility, but there are numerous proposals to resolve this in the future). In particular, I believe Bitcoin is much better than Gold in terms of scarcity because first of all there's a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins unlike Gold which the supply grows over time. Also, with Gold, there could be a massive find that could effect the market. That is not possible in Bitcoin.

I'm talking in the future. Let's picture a future where LN is ubiquitous and nodes are reletively cheap and Bitcoin is a reserve currency that people generally hold their money in. A company could manufacture a payment terminal that is not operated by any third parties. It would be a full node and a LN client. It would be affordable to buy and businesses wouldn't have to pay monthly fees to a bitpay. As this hardware becomes cheaper it makes even more sense to cut out the middleman for good. None of this works if running a full node is extortionarily expensive.

I realize you don't think it can become a reserve currency. That's besides the point. When people generally talk about it that's what they mean. It's a true proof of work unlike govt. fiat.

Actually, they should keep them running during the grace period as well because there could be a chain split during the grace period.

So, bottomline, keep running your BIP148 nodes through the next difficulty adjustment period (approx 2.5 weeks).

There are two proposals that are being circulated. How many were you hoping for?


Sztorc is proposing a sidechain based on his drivechain with higher capacity (maybe something with a dynamic cap). His idea is it's the best of both worlds because you can use onchain scaling on the sidechain and not mess with the main chain. I'm not sure if that will be what is actually deployed, but I like the separation into a sidechain because that allows everyone to get their cake and eat it too. The sharding idea is interesting, but I don't know if it's necessary because you could have two chains one for large settlements (main chain) and a second chain for high capacity (just regular bitcoin with a dynamic block size). I could also see the sidechain potentially being a mimblewimble chain with lightning (which is possible according to Andrew Polestra) for high capacity use. The cool thing about this is that the full blockchain would not use up a lot of disk space as it scales with the UTXO set as opposed to number of blocks.

Yeah, bitcoin has a 10 minute block time and ethereum has a 17 second block time, but that doesn't mean there can't be two chains. It might take longer, but the other chain may not die. Why take the risk when we can fix malleability with a soft fork?
@_date: 2018-06-02 13:52:02


I guess it depends on the context. If Bitcoin becomes a world reserve currency (i.e. market cap of &gt; $100 trillion), there is no question that all cell phone makers will incorporate Bitcoin as a base level payment protocol that we build around. If it doesn't become a world reserve currency and kind of drifts around as it is today, obviously that won't happen. We'll just have to see. I'm not worried about it though. This problem will be solved on way or another.

My understanding is that SolidX is proposing an ETF that holds Bitcoin Futures, which are cash settled. The big issue I see with this is that when you hold actual bitcoin, you benefit from the forks. In 2017, the GBTC (Silbert's trust) issued around 20% in dividends related to these forks. This fund would not pay those out because they don't hold the underlying, just the futures.

While some businesses may do things that are immoral, there is nothing inherently immoral about businesses. As long as everything is voluntary and no fraud occurs, it's about as moral as you can get.


That would not be neat at all to me. Who is the person deciding which businesses to break up? Don't you think they may be biased based on their own interests and might be corrupt or corruptible?


Profit is just a scorecard to who is producing the most value. There is absolutely nothing wrong with profit and it should be celebrated. If Bitcoin doesn't survive the profit motive, it has no hope.

I'm open to another term, but the point is that by holding the underlying you get the fork coins and I think you understood what I meant. The futures don't give you this which is on reason it's advantageous to own spot. There are others.

The way I see bitcoin's value going to zero is if there is a bug that cannot be fixed that renders it useless. Governments could do things that hurt bitcoin for sure but I don't see them being able to completely  destroying it such that the price goes to zero. I suppose a bug could be the cause that makes people loose faith in it. Keep in mind though, people have been looking for such a bug for almost 8 years now and have not been able to find it. We know that because there would be an enormous financial incentive for someone to expose such a bug. Of course, that doesn't mean it can't happen.

You could replace bitcoin in this article with any form of sound money. Rice was used as money in feudal Japan. You could argue that it was using way to much energy to produce the rice compared to the fiat money that it replaced. In order to obtain rice, you needed to expend energy planting it, growing it, harvesting it, etc. The same holds true for gold. You need to mine it out of the ground. The reason people like bitcoin, gold, or rice for that matter as money is precisely the reason that this article is discrediting bitcoin for. You can only produce bitcoin by expending energy. The same is true for any form of sound money though by definition. The alternative is a currency that can be created at will. It's a nice thought, but as we've seen throughout history, the consequences are devastating. Bitcoin is the perfect form of sound money because it has perfectly controlled supply and can only be created by proof of work.

Bitcoin as a store of value has a ton of utility and works fine with 1mb blocks.
@_date: 2016-11-30 11:12:57
I agree that would be a more rational approach. Even in the 1 year plan, I don't see how they can get concensus (to a level needed to avoid a split like eth/etc) because there's at least 25-30% that won't go for it no matter what, probably more. I just don't see a path forward for bigger blocks at this point which means we need to scale bitcoin in other ways, segwit, schnorr,  mast, coinjoin, lightning network, and sidechains (other things not invented ). It will take a while for the network to come to this realization, but it seems inevitable to me.

I think your analysis is dead on. This would not happen right away, but if it drags on long enough, I suspect we'll see this scenario play out. I would hope it passes the normal way with 95% of hash power though so we don't have to get to this point.

@_date: 2016-12-08 19:27:31
The price is not reflecting your worries about losing customers. It may be that some people who wanted to use bitcoin tried and failed, but the use cases that have traditionally worked still work just fine: under served and store of value. If you want something fast, it's not going to be a hard fork. Most of the core devs favor a 1 year activation period and we still don't have consensus on which proposal to use. Segwit is probably the quickest way to get additional capacity and probably more importantly price relief on fees.
@_date: 2016-11-11 11:58:29

No because there is no one year waiting period like gbtc so there will be no premium. The AP can freely convert from btc to the etf shares and vice-versa at any time. That means the shares will trade with parity to btc price. This will result in the fund being a big buyer of btc.

@_date: 2016-12-13 06:35:21
Payment channels work today even without the maleability fix. The maleability fix is required for bidirectional payment channels. Without it, you'd only be able to send payment or receive payment in your channel but not do both at the same time. You could open up two channels, but that doubles the amount of data written to the blockchain and also you'd have to close the channels more often because you would drain them and not be able to refill them.

I somewhat agree with you on the payment system for bricks and mortar being a ways out. Maybe even 10 years, but the price will rise in anticipation of that transformation occurring. I actually think in the near term, the catalyst will be a bunch of pension funds realize that Bitcoin is their only option due to too low interst rates and an over value stock market. The next jump will be due to central banks realizing that bitcoin is a better reserve currency than the dollar. Finally, after there is concensus in the financial markets, the payment system will be rolled out.
@_date: 2016-12-14 23:11:41
Yep, exactly. The network effects will push things toward a single blockchain. Any features that are in other blockchains will be incorporated into bitcoin either on main chain or via sidechains if it's not possible to incorporate on the main chain.

Depending on how it's implemented, the bigger miners get the most say in what size blocks should be. That's dangerous because their cost of storage can be distributed across their total hash power. They could set the block size very high just to push out the competition.

What I am proposing is a way for everyone to get their cake and eat it too. The goal should be to not mess up any of the use cases. One use case is store of value. Making blocks much larger makes that usecase less secure and is totally unnecessary. We can make a sidechain with 100mb blocks and keep the main chain at 1mb. Why would we not do that? Anyone who wants cheap transactions just goes onto the sidechain and anyone worried about security can just use the current block chain. It's a win-win. Another thing that people don't understand about LN is just how much capacity it would have. If we get segwit + schnorr signatures + coinjoin + LN, we can scale to VISA levels even without increasing block size (beyond what segwit does). People seem to be missing this point. Here's a video where Adam Back discusses this:

There's also the group who want something called flexible transactions. I haven't researched it much, but it appears to be a maleability fix. It also requires a hard fork. Also, most of the people who want segwit after a block size increase appear to want it as a hard fork as well. So, to me it really appears to be that there are some people who are against soft forks. The problem with that is that a hard fork will not happen anytime soon. First of all, we need to get concensus. Personally, I don't see us getting concensus for a HF on something that can be done with a SF so that will probably never happen. Then, if somehow we did get concensus, it would require probably a 1 year activation period. The obvious choice is to activate segwit which can be done in less than a month. Then work on LN, Schnorr, etc. I think we will get to the point where people see this, but we're not there yet.

Yep. There are other things at play as well since bitcoin is sound money it's not possible to have as much debt issued against it so there would be more wealth in pure bitcoin as opposed to debt as it is today. Basically if you beleive the thesis of bitcoin as being superior to fiat and you think it can dis place the other currencies, the price per bitcoin must be much higher than $1 million of today's dollars.

With any block size, it will eventually fill up if bitcoin is successful. I'm glad we're facing this problem now. If we kicked the can, we'd have this problem later when we had more users. Now we can address it by building systems aoubd bitcoin that allow for this mode of opperation.

Bitcoin works great for as a store of value. Let's not break that by increasing block size to infinity. Let's instead try to solve the real problem which is how do we scale.

Not sure what the theranos logic fallacy is, but if you claim something is a logical fallacy you should explain why.
In terms of restaurants, obviously I have never heard of a restaurant that does this because restaurants have peak hours so eventually you will get a table if you're willing to wait long enough. If your point is that Bitcoin is not exactly like restaurants, then I agree with you. Bitcoin is pretty unique. I still think it's a valid comparison to help understand why bitcoin would be useful at full capacity. For people using Bitcoin as a store of value, they will not care if transaction fees go up a lot (like even $10+) because it would also mean that there is a lot of demand to use Bitcoin. People would not use it for everyday purchases though. This may not be your vision of bitcoin, but to say it will be useless if blocks fill up is kind of silly because it has been demonstrated to not be true. If you're worried about your transaction getting kicked out after 2 days, all you need to do is increase your fee to a point where that won't happen.
I don't see how you see bitcoin scaling without eventually having a fee market. There can be some debate about what size is safe today, but there will eventually be a ceiling because even if we have VISA level of transactions (which is a small portion of the worlds financial transactions), the blocks would be so enormous that no almost no one would be able to even download the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:46:10
This is right. There's really only two or three things needed in the core protocol to support this view: sidechain op code (being worked on Paul Stortz) and Segwit. A third nice to have is Schnorr signatures (which Pieter Wuille is working on next). After these are implemented I pretty much think the core protocol doesn't need much work (at least on the consensus side, maybe some network improvements and other non consensus related things). Hopefully people will eventually see the light.

@_date: 2016-12-17 04:36:11
This is where these arguments get scary to me. The optimal size has nothing to do with demand. If bitcoin becomes popular practicaly any block size will be full. Let's say we have 1 billion users, even 100 mb blocks would be full. Does that mean blocks bigger than 100 mb are optimal? If bitcoin is successful blocks must fill up. I think it's a reasonable to ask at what size can we allow blocks to be before they fill up, but saying they should never be allowed to be full means the bitcoin network must give away free (or very low cost) permanent storage.

If fees go up much higher people will go to offchain solutions. To some degree I see that as inevitable. I don't see the fees going up to $100 anytime soon though. I wrote a post about this earlier: 
The other option is a higher capacity merged mined sidechain. I think that's an attractive option because it will address the people who want lower fees and the people who want more security because you can have both.

I did not say it's not possible to issue debt against Bitcoin. I said it's not possible to issue as much debt against bitcoin.

My point is that if we optimize the blockchain instead of throwing hardware at it, we could eventually run full nodes on cell phones. There are many benefits to doing that.

No, not like a startup or enterprise. It's like the internet. People can put up roadblocks and they are routed around.
| I'm not saying that it will never work at all but it will not work as advertised (distributed, decentralized and trustless).
It will still be trustless even if there is some coordination among the nodes. If someone exhibits bad behavior they will be left out. That is still decentralized and distributed, but it's not how looking at the problem as a theoretical computer science approach would lead you to believe. It's more like a community. LN is the governance structure, but the community still makes choices about how to best operate.

I read the first 10 comments or so and none of them support segwit as in Bitcoin core 0.13.1. They're all either talking about parts of it or a HF segwit or flexible transactions or else just against it. I count all of these as against segwit because the hard forks will not get consensus.

Not really, even if we raised the block size, usage would fill up the blocks sooner or later. We'd be in the same position we are now with less security and still not have solved the problem. In order to scale in a meaningful way, we need to do it off chain via lightning. If we want to increase the block size, we should do it in a sidechain.

I believe the HTLCs only come into play if someone "cheats" so they're not expected to be broadcast very often. In normal circumstances a 2 of 2 is what gets broadcast. Thus layer 1 should optimize for 2 of 2 multisig. Yes, signature aggregation can be done on a 2 of 2, but maybe we just use a huge coinjoin for the entire block using the CT/bulletproof/coinjoin, right? In that case, sounds like MAST doesn't help things and schnorr is not needed because the range proof is already aggregated in bullet proofs, right?
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:51:16
This is a little unrelated and may be difficult to answer, but how do you see all these technologies (Schnorr signatures, CT, bulletproofs, MAST, coinjoin, maybe even mimble wimble, lightning network or other layer 2 options) working together in an optimized way for both scale and privacy? For example, on layer 1, do we have coinjoin combined with CT/bulletproofs, how does MAST fit in to further reduce size? What layer 2 tech is most promising lightning or something else?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:49:50
I would say that Segwit was slightly different in this respect though because there were actually winers and losers with Segwit. For instance, Bitmain lost with segwit because they couldn't use asicboost any longer. Additionally, segwit _IS_ a block size increase. So, there's an argument that it reduces decentralization. With schnorr signatures, it's really just an optimization that you can choose to use on an opt-in basis. I really see it as much less controversial than segwit. The same goes for MAST.

Proof of work is infallible.
@_date: 2015-08-07 23:20:07


Actually, quite the opposite. Bitcoin allows for smart contracts and all sorts of legal arrangements that are impossible today because it's programmable money. It will create a much more egalitarian society. Also, due to proof of work, you can't just print money into existence. That is the problem today. We have a group of oligarchs headed by the group that controls the ability to create money. Bitcoin addresses that issue. Even if early adopters get an advantage out of the gate (which they earned by their foresight), the money will quickly flow to people who create value.

Ok, cool. So sounds like a pretty good architecture for point to point payments would be to use LN on top of Coinjoin with CT/bulletproofs and signature aggregation. MAST doesn't help out much for this use case. If, everyone chose to participate in the Coinjoin, you'd be able to fit all inputs + outputs and a single range proof (CT) and a single 64 byte signature. The range proof is log n size where n = number of inputs.

I believe the intent is that if the lowest vote is for X and 25% of those people voted for X, you'd end up with X as the floor because you eliminate the 20% bottom which is entirely X and you have the 5% also for X in the votes that count and therefor X is the floor.

Thank you for taking the time to write that. I share some of those same thoughts with you. In particular about how we just ask the core devs to keep things running. They are doing much more, but when there's a choice of moving fast or sustaining, they should tend toward sustaining. The block size debate is a great example of this. Let's focus on what happens 7 generations out, not how next quarters profit numbers will be.

You don't know that nothing has ever been changed. You are trusting a centralized authority. I don't have any reason to believe that Wikipedia has modified records, but just saying, having it in the blockchain has the security of the hashing power of the network that it has not changed.

The issue is that with the current proposals "big blocks" have meant a backwards incompatible upgrade. To me the most logical way to get big blocks without being incompatible is Paul Sztorc's proposal to make a big block side chain. Then small blockers can stay on the main chain (with high fees) and big blockers can still use the same bitcoin store of value on a higher capacity (less secure) chain. Or, what most logical people would do, use the big block chain for spending money and main chain for savings. I have yet to hear a reason why that won't work other than things from rbtc like, sidechains are patented by the evil blockstream and they will not allow it to work.
@_date: 2015-08-10 00:23:09
You should be more optimistic. The fee market is based on supply and demand. The miners will make more money by raising the limit. It will happen eventually. They just want to make sure the market develops. The worst thing we can do is interfere.

LN already has multiple anonymity features in it. For instance it uses onion routing for the payments. It also uses SSL to connect to nodes. So, I think that anonymity is already there, but LN still requires on chain transactions. Those are the 2 of 2 multisigs I mentioned. These transactions take up space on the blockchain and can be traced. So, basically you want to have privacy on both layers. The good news from this particular article is that if you combine Coinjoin with CT/bulletproofs you will get very good anonymity on layer 1 at essentially no additional cost. LN will also have it's own privacy features as well so it's a very robust and scalable solution.

Yeah except that both of those technologies are open source. I think you should look at the history of the people that work at blockstream before making this kind of immature attack on their character. Adam has dedicated much of his life to cryptocurrency even before bitcoin. I am quite sure the developers that work there could make more money by working at a bigger company if that was their top priority. The investors have stated they care more about the success of bitcoin than making profit from blockstream.

The reason I mentioned layer two is because LN uses 2 of 2 multisig, can MAST reduce the size or improve privacy? How about schnorr? I guess overall the question is, given that LN means we're primarily using 2 of 2 multisigs, which tech on layer 1 optimizes that. Or should we use something else like TumbleBit. If we choose Tumblebit maybe there are different optimum methods used on layer 1. For example, maybe MimbleWimble is better for lightning than tumblebit (just an example, not saying it's so).

It's the floor of miners' votes after throwing out the bottom and top 20% according to the BIP. Economically speaking, rationing goods (in this case bitcoin transactions) does not make sense. I can't think of a reason 20% of miners would collude to create the blocksize lower than it should be. Can you?

My assumption is that most day to day uses will eventually be in layer 2. Therefore, the question is how do we optimize layer 1 for a given layer 2. If we use Tumblebit, the answer may be different than if we use LN. So, the question is really: which layer 2 do you think will win out and given that layer 2 tech, which layer 1 techniques optimize for that layer particular layer 2. My guess is we get LN as layer 2 with CT/bulletproofs and coinjoin on layer 1. First, am I right about that? Second, how does schnorr and mast fit into that? Can they optimize things further or are they redundant?

To make it more clear. Bitcoin cash has created ~ 0.7% more supply since Aug 1st than Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself is growing at ~ 4% inflation rate. So, if we approximate that rate across an entire year, the inflation rate is about 2.8% higher than Bitcoin. So the total inflation rate of Bitcoin Cash is around 7%, whereas Bitcoin is around 4%. I don't think either could be considered "hyperinflation", but Bitcoin Cash has a significantly higher inflation rate.

There is even a wikipedia page about it so you can take a look. As recently as a few years back, this was not the case. Luke was one of the people responsible for making this information come out as he relentlessly asked people about bilderberg and they pretended that they didn't know what it was.

If they thought that then why would they want to build a bitcoin bank that has 0 fee purchases of bitcoin? They don't make any money.


LOL, first off bitcoin is not expensive. I can do a transaction for $0.14 according to mycelium. Secondly, if you scumbags would stop blocking progress we'd have segwit which would increase capacity and setup lightning network which will allow true microtransactions which will be essentially free. Even if store of value were the only use case, I'd hardly call that niche when the gold market is over $7 trillion alone.

In my proposal, the block size remains capped at 1mb. Instead we just have as many blocks as miners deem necessary so no one would be able to set the block size any larger. It wouldn't make sense for a miner to mine on one array and then switch to another because then they'd guarantee to orphan one of their blocks.

My problem with this wallet is that you only have 1 of the 3 keys. That means you don't really control the bitcoins. Also, I don't like the idea of sending my finger prints over the wire. I would also be concerned about privacy with this device since every transaction came from a single 2 of 3 multisig address. On the positive side, they appear to have the ui/ux solid. Maybe they can address these issues or make another version with a little more privacy and security.

You probably wouldn't know if the hub (actually should be referred to as node) was hacked, but what you would see is that your funds had not been pushed through the system for a significant amount of time. The payment should happen in a few seconds or less, but let's say you don't get your payment for an hour because one of the nodes in your path is not responding due to being hacked (or any other reason for that matter); all you would need to do is broadcast the transaction that closes your payment channel. So, basically you have no risks (other than paying the bitcoin transaction fee). An interesting thing to note is that if a node did get hacked, financially, it would make sense for them to continue to operate the node in an honest way because then they'd make the lightning network fees, whereas if they stopped operating the node they wouldn't gain anything at all because you'd just settle your channel and therefore kill their opportunity to make money on LN. In terms of a duration, I believe that only comes into play with the CLTV version of LN. CSV, which uses sequence numbers doesn't expire and you could just close the channel when you become impatient waiting.

Agree that a fork might be the best way to go. These two groups seem too far apart to reconcile. It probably makes more sense to let these two organisms move around the peitre dish.

If the LN hub gets hacked, you'd broadcast your latest settlement transaction to the network and thus prevent the loss of stolen funds. The other answer is that like bitcoin, eventually those kind of libraries would be removed in favor of custom code that has been very well tested. I even see the LN code potentially moving into a hardware wallet.

I think the solution is to change the structure of the network such that a small microtransaction is charged to d/l each block from a node. Similar to the original idea for proof of work wrt email. Then nodes that host blocks can get some compensation for hosting the blocks.

In a way, I've thought that coinbase would benefit more from smaller blocks in the long run because then, we'd have to have bitcoin banks and they'd be in the best spot to capitalize on that. So, I think he truly thinks that big blocks are better for bitcoin. I don't think the bitcoin ecosystem is big enough for companies like coinbase or blockstream to use these sort of strategies. For now, everyone should cooperate. Granted, that's not exactly what's happening today.

@_date: 2016-02-07 07:53:41
Banks also just record transactions and are not the controlling parties, but they are required to follow kyc and aml. I think the reason that miners are not required to follow regulation is not because they are not transmitting money, it is because if one country regulated them, they'd just move to another. The same thing is true for lightning network. If one country makes it illegal to run a node, the nodes would just move to another country.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:35:56
I see. The weak block side of the equation doesn't exist today though. That is the part that will have more of an impact because you can propogate the block before you actually win. Also getting the block relay into core would be better because it would mean that all nodes benefit.

If you are an investor it probably doesn't matter a whole lot then because you are not going to be doing a lot of transactions. So even if a transaction costs ~$1 or less it's even less than commissions on stock trades. From my point of view, it will be nice to eventually get a fix to transaction malleability (like Segwit) because that opens up the ability to do a much more efficient version of lightning network. Since segwit does this and is coded/tested/running on testnet for over a year now I think it makes sense for miners to activate it (which can be done in 2 weeks plus a 2 week grace period). Hope this info helps.

In my method, there is no such thing as lying. You can try to solve a block with 1000 sub blocks if you want. Most likely no one else will work on the 1000 sub block problem (assuming that's too many sub blocks) though. Basically what happens at the point where an entire set of sub blocks are solved, all miners can choose how many sub blocks to work on. So, lets say miner A sees that the last block set had 10 blocks, he might start working on a 10 block set. So, he would try to solve one of the 10 sub blocks. Miner B might decide that it would be better to work on a 11 block set. If miner B solves a block first, he publishes it. It's highly likely that whoever gets the block that miner B solved would switch over to the 11 block set solution because it's already 1/11 solved. In this scenario, it doesn't make any sense to work on an extremely large block set because people would probably have a preset high block size and ignore you're block sets if you did something like use a 1000 block set. Make sense?

Read the bitcoin white paper to understand better. Basically over time, transactions become more difficult to change. This is why for big transactions it's recommended to wait for 6 confirmations. The bug you cited was fixed and happened more than 5 years ago. Even that only took 5 hours to correct.
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:04:57
The thing is that what Satoshi made is not a very good payment network. It doesn't scale, It takes around 10 minutes to get a single confirmation. It has some problems with fungibility. The good news is that all of these things are solvable. But it's going to take additional layers to solve them. If we stick to the original vision, it just won't be very good as a payment network.

There will also be a percentage who insist on a fork at some point. I believe that the large block fork will initially out perform the 1mb chain. But eventually the 1mb chain will win out. This could take a very long time though.

The good thing is that wallets can update after the fork safely and no loss of bitcoins. If a particular wallet is lagging though, there's no reason to not switch to another wallet that has support and there are many wallets that will have support on day 1. There's really no excuse for not having upgraded given all the delays so far. It's survival of the fittest.

They'd have to change their business model, maybe raise their fees, setup payment channels with people they frequently transact with (e.g. bitpay). So I never said it's simple, but strategically I think it would make sense for them.

@_date: 2017-04-16 06:56:48
I don't think people using LN will have to do nearly as many on chain transactions as people think. With segwit, LN channels are bidirectional and can remain open forever. One tx per year is probably sufficient. Also schnorr signatures and coinjoin will increase capacity. I think we're looking at several hundred million users without a block size increase.
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:02:15
That number is if all 7 billion people were using LN.

Thanks for the explanation. So, I assume you favor this approach over thin blocks? Also, how do you combine this with weak blocks? Or do you?
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:24:23
The basic difference between my proposal and yours is that you set the number of blocks in the second dimension based on previous transactions. I leave it up to the miners. So, basically the miner to win the first block in a new dimension gets to pick. There is a natural incentive to pick an optimal block size in order to get the most amount of transaction revenue while not being beaten to the punch by other miners.
@_date: 2016-02-06 21:36:17

I agree with most of what you said except the part about 1mb not working in the near future. It works just fine now and it will in the future as well. With Segwit and LN it will have more capacity than FedWire. For a while now, I've thought it makes sense to have two forks though. I think that will happen eventually. Then everyone can use whichever coin they want.
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:27:35
Segwit is the last remaining thing to do LN on the main chain. Side chain work today as a federated peg. The two way peg will be fairly straightforward once Segwit is in place. I wouldn't be surprised if we see it this year.
@_date: 2016-02-12 06:04:35
While you are right that some people may choose fractioal reserve (and I don't see a problem with that choice as long as it's not forced), I'm not seeing how it's possible to demand a central bank.
@_date: 2016-02-22 14:15:30
If you are saying you could download a copy of the blockchain and change some transaction from 2 years ago, you could do that, but the hash for the block you changed would not check out and therefore anyone you sent that block to would know it is invalid. So, while you can change it, everyone on the network would ignore you.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:14:46
Thank you Andreas!

Yes! Thank you. It would be nice to get segwit. It would be nice to get Schnorr. It would be nice to get Mast. It would be nice to get Sidechains or Extension blocks. But all these are unnecessary. Bitcoin is working and that can't be taken away unless we mess it up like we would have if BU got activated.

I would suggest that you read the lightning network paper to get a better understanding of what it is and how it works.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:12:03
Based on earlier comments wouldn't the block relay avoid half of the round trip and therefore minimize block propagation time? I think you need the full round trip for iblt right? I'm wondering if it makes more sense to do block relay + weak blocks as opposed to iblt + weak blocks. @_date: 2016-02-22 12:32:23
While it's not incorrect, it totally misses the point that this data is both ordered and immutable. Backups can be done without the blockchain.

So you  don't see your relay being incorporated into p2p code? I guess I was more optimistic about the p2p code with things like weak blocks and IBLTs. I suppose you could still send weak blocks through your relay, with changes to core.

Not worried, scaling will happen off chain.
@_date: 2016-09-09 19:27:40
The trade-off for a smaller/larger block time is that the lower you go in time the higher the orphan rate which disadvantages smaller miners. I think it's fine to keep it at 10 minutes, because with lightning network you can get instant payments anyways so all we need to do is wait for lightning network and the problem is solved in a superior way. On subsequent lightning transactions, you hold a transaction that can be submit to the network which will refund the appropriate amount to each party and close the payment channel so if anything goes wrong, you hold the transaction that will settle things as agreed to. So instant payments are practical.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:01:12
Not seeing the triad connection. Any reason for that or just random speculation?
@_date: 2016-09-09 17:35:38


My point is if you want to accept a single confirmation on a blockchain with 17 second blocks, that is not as secure as a confirmation on a 10 minute blockchain. There are also tradeoffs to lowering the confirmation times. It increases the orphan rate.


The commitment transaction in lightning network is a confirmed bitcoin transaction.

Just sarchasm. Financial pundits frequently say this kind of thing. I meant it as a joke.
@_date: 2016-09-08 18:20:01
The other person who asked the question: "Which altcoin solves the scaling issue?" has a good point, but also keep in mind Segwit will almost double the transaction capacity and we get an additional boost by Schnorr signatures (maybe 1.5x). There was also an article that was talking about how Coinjoin with Schnorr signatures scales things even more. Those things combined give us something like a 3-4mb equivalent block size. So, we have a decent ramp up during the 2-3 years it will take for wide integration as was suggested.

Weak blocks won't improve confirmation times and decreasing the block speed lowers security. Lightning network will give us instant confirmations with the same level if security as 10 minute confirmations. It also doesn't require a hardfork.

Right, if you get a 6% net income and you put down maybe 33% at 4% interest on your loan, you increase your rents by 4% per year and get 4% appreciation and shield most or all of your income with depreciation and interest deduction, that adds up to a very good return over say 10 years, something you wouldn't get in the stock market. You are right that there's risk and I think it works best if you're either very diversified or have other sources of income.

These usually relate to "SPV mining". Basically, the miner gets the hash of the block without downloading the full block by listening to the other pools and trusting them. They can then mine a block at this point, but they can't include transactions because they don't know which transactions are in the previous block. So they just mine with no transactions other than the coinbase transaction until they get the full block through normal means of propagation. Then they continue with standard mining (including the unmined transactions). It's a controversial practice. Some think it's ok, others think it's VERY bad.

Dryja (sp?) from the lightning network did a presentation on how you could do payments that send a probabilistic payment which would emulate a fraction of a satoshi. In other words, if you pay someone it would randomly choose whether to pay the satoshi or not pay the satoshi. So, over time if you got 1000 payments with a 25% probability of payment you'd very likely have close to 250 satoshis. This works very well for micropayments because you don't really care if you get a fraction of a satoshi, but you care if at the end of the day you get approximately the amount you expect.
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:49:32

You have this very irritating habit of putting words in people's mouths. Interpreting the Bible is a totally different subject, but the point is that there have been warnings about letting one entity control what you can buy or sell for ages. You would do well to not ignore those warnings.


Again, ad hominem attack. I guess I should expect that from a lawyer though since you can only deal in logical fallacies since your system is based on deception. The point I was originally making was that people will prefer Bitcoin to digital fiat because they will be able to buy whatever they want without a central entity censoring certain transactions. If they can now buy cuban cigars great, they still can't play online poker as far as I know and there are definitely a lot of transactions that would get censored. People would rather not have these restrictions.


I don't disagree with you that most people are idiots, but that doesn't give you the right to prevent people from opting in to the monetary policy they want. If you can come up with a superior monetary policy, create a coin that has that policy and the market will determine if that's the best monetary policy out there. If Bitcoin has such a horrible monetary policy, no one will use it so you have nothing to worry about.

Kind of, but keep in mind you really only need this if your dealing with fractions of a satoshi. If the fee is &gt; 1 satoshi, no need to use this because you can just pay the satoshi. But, let's say for instance the cost to send one packet of data is 0.2 satoshi. You just make a probabilistic payment of 0.2 satoshi and your done. In reality you can only either pay 1 or 0 satoshi, but only 20% of the time do you pay a satoshi. The rest of the time you dont pay. If you send 1000 packets, chances are you paid about 200 satoshi total. It's convenient for both the user and the provider and at the end of the day everything evens out.

What is the alternative to having 80% of the supply out there? Do you think it would be better to create more supply? That's what the federal reserve does. Do you think the money that the federal reserve prints goes to the 7 billion people out there? Of course it doesn't. They loan it out (at interest) to other entities that are closely tied to them. The 7 billion people out there will get some of the bitcoin the same way they get dollars (or whatever local currency they have) today. They will get it by providing products and services to the people that have the bitcoin. The benefit they will see is a much better economy based on the sound money principals of Bitcoin.

They could still use a unique address as the exchanges let you get multiple address for funding. I'm not sure if there's a limit of addresses an exchange will give you, but I'm sure due to Bitpay's volume, they could work something out with the exchanges to get many addresses.

There's more than 13m bitcoin holders. It's probably much closer to 66m, but for the purposes of that tweet, the point is there's still not that many bitcoin users so whether it's 13m or 66m, the tweet's point still stands that not many people are using bitcoin yet. Since bitcoin is a form of money, the target market is people who use money. I have no idea where the chart comes from and the person didn't respond about the source. Again, I think the point of the tweet is that relatively few people use bitcoin whether that number is closer to 13m or 66m is not too significant imho.

Maybe I'm missing something, but to me it seems far better to fail on privacy vs. failing on bitcoin supply. So far, the changes that the market has favored in bitcoin are ones that don't harm others and are more of opt-in nature. For example, there were no major fights over CSV and CLTV because they were just new opcodes that were completly opt-in. The major dispute was over the block size and the market has favored Segwit over larger block sizes presumably because it is the more conservative proposal and causes less harm to those that favored smaller blocks and superior decentralization in the system. As we all know, the 21m supply of bitcoin is completely sacrosanct and almost no one even considers proposals to increase the supply so a change that could possibly result in the ability for an attacker with a high powered quantum computer to secretly create an unlimited supply of bitcoin is mind boggling to me. On the other, hand a proposal to add a non-quantum safe privacy solution to bitcoin seems to be much more in-line with the type of opt-in improvements that the bitcoin market favors. I would expect the market to again favor this sort of proposal as they did with Segwit. It would be clear to everyone that the privacy is not quantum safe that as long as that is disclosed properly everyone would understand what they were getting with this opt-in feature. After all, no one has to use CT and if it fails on privacy alone, were basically back to the drawing board as we are today. Again, maybe I'm missing something, but that's my take so far based on my understanding of the options.

This is a really great summary, but a couple things that seem to missed:
1.) On privacy: the author doesn't seem to be aware that the LN is onion routed (this is not an option, but mandatory) so even the "hubs" you are connected to will not know who you are paying. So the picture is actually even better.
2.) On the 1 cent per txn calculation average: There are reasons to believe that the actual number will be less than this. One of the important reasons why is that the large bitcoin holders will have reason to subsidize the cost of the LN. The value of the system is greatly improved for all and for them by having sub 1 cent txns. They also have the bitcoin available to lock into the channels. Also, I think that 4 million hubs with 4 thousand channels is overkill. With hub counts in the hundreds of thousands (perhaps even less?) and channel counts in the hundreds, we'd still be able to have sufficient decentralization and the cost of operating would be dramatically lower. Currently, there is a maximum channel size limit of ~ 0.12 btc, but I think it makes sense to raise this limit so that the backbone hubs can have large connections between themselves. Whether this is needed or not will become more clear as the LN scales.
But other than those two nits, this was a very valuable article. Maybe it starts the discussion of how the LN hub topology will be laid out.

I don't see regular businesses accepting bitcoin in the next 2-3 years, but even if they did the settlement time is faster than the traditional banking system, so I don't really see that objection by businesses. I also don't see how you can improve on Bitcoin's settlement mechanism without trading off security. You could in theory do 17 second confirmations like ethereum, but they would be &lt; 3% as secure as the current confirmations. MimbleWimble is very interesting, but is probably further out than LN and the other enhancements that have been mentioned.

Not true at all. The people hodling are increasing the scarcity of Bitcoin by keeping it off the market and thus increasing the value.

In today's world it's obvious why fiat exists. It's much more convenient than cryptos because it's accepted everywhere and the infrastructure is more mature (e.g. Visa is very convenient, online banking works well, dollar bills are accepted everywhere), but presumably those types of things can exist (and be even better) for Bitcoin. When that happens, what's the point of having fiat? It really would have no advantage that I see.

Criminal law involves a crime against the public (or government) and civil law involves dispute between two individuals. In the case of a traffic ticket, you're not directly harming another individual. The argument goes that you're harming the public by speeding. That would fall into criminal from what I can see. If you get a speeding ticket in California, you go to the superior court, traffic division which is the same court you go to if you commit a burglary or murder, etc. Civil is more like if you go to court because someone broke an agreement with you.

No, as long as you have connections from person A to person B, a payment can be routed through the system.


You will have to wait for a confirmation before your funds are available for instant transactions, but the UI that is being promoted is one where you keep using bitcoin as it is today for payments, but instead of just making a payment to an address for say $5, you open a channel with your payee for $12 with a commitment of $5 so that you still have a balance of $7 to transact instantly on the lightning network.


We will have to see, but the method I described above minimizes centralization because everyone is a node on the network.


While funds cannot be stolen, reputation is still important because your counterparty could tie up your funds for a day or two. Anonymity is also desirable. It's possible to have reputation systems while still remaining anonymous (Open Bazaar has one).


I don't see it as any more likely than "Will wallet operators end up being regulated?" because it's really just a specific kind of wallet.

It's probably best if you read the lightning network white paper. But yes the idea is that you use a standard bitcoin address to make payments and that is translated onto the lightning network. The method of getting from node a to node b is a standard routing problem which fortunately is a well understood problem due to the internet. When I said counterparty, I was referring to the channel operator. No, they have no incentives to tie up your money. In fact, they have a disincentive because they won't collect the fee. But you still have to plan for that in case for instance they go offline for an extended period.

If you have bitcoins stored in many different ways you're more likely to lose some of them. If you store them in relatively few places but have multiple backups of each you're less likely to lose them.


Using an HD wallet naturally does this on every transaction. You don't have to pre-emptively split.


This is something would be important if you have a lot of Bitcoin. In that case, $80 would be a small price to pay to split coins. If you're talking about $1m yes you'd want to do some splitting if you made retail payments. If you have a few hundred bucks it doesn't really matter much.

Bitcoin's primary use case at the moment is as a savings mechanism. There is a lot of work to make it better for instance/cheap payments. But even without those, it's fine if it's just used this way. That's the way gold was used before we had a central bank. Banks could issue Bitcoin certificates just like they issued gold certificates previously. This in no way prevents consumption.

That's not how pension funds work. Customers cannot convert their money in the fund into fiat. They usually need to keep it in the pension until they reach a certain age.

You should probably consider implementing this. The core feature of OpenBazaar is this escrow process. Basically, you can choose an escrow agent on each transaction. So, if there is a dispute, that agent can make the decision about how to distribute funds. Without that feature, a buyer has to trust the seller 100% which is essentially a non-starter with anonymous transactions.

They would not be able to borrow money on anywhere near the scale they do now. The national debt is $18 trillion and m2 is about $11 trillion. With a deflationary currency, lenders would have to be a lot more strict and were talking orders of magnitude less borrowing power. Big government needs a central bank to survive. It wouldn't be unreasonable to expect income taxes to go back to what they were in the 1800s when we were on a gold standard: 5% or so. At this point, without the power of the printing press I think they'd find the black and grey markets growing out of control. They wouldn't be able to print money to pay additional IRS agents or other enforcers. By the way, I don't think its a coincidence that the IRS and the federal reserve were founded in the same year.

1.) Purse.io doesn't have anything to do with stolen credit cards it just matches people up who want to acquire bitcoin with people who want to buy things on Amazon and you can usually buy at a discount. You can also save money on remittences, I've helped some friends do it. I haven't done the gift cards, but I understand you get a 3% discount with some places.
2.) If you use bitcoin, more people will become aware of it. Many of us on think that's a good thing.

This sounds like an accelerator. I've heard of some 6 week programs that fund you about $20,000 to go through the 6 weeks with the intention of obtaining a found of funding from another source immediately after the program. However, usually this also involves a lot of mentoring from someone with a lot of experience in terms of vc funding and startups. Orange doesn't strike me as that. So, yeah it seems like they should be more interested in later stages of funding. Not sure what they have in mind.

If there is a contentious fork, speculators would want to trade COIN A for COIN B. There would be money in it for an exchange. If miners created a fork which increased the block rewards (at least at the moment) I can't imagine anyone taking that fork seriously. Personally, I would sell any coins in that fork and buy into the regular bitcoin fork if it would be possible to do so. That's why it would not happen.
@_date: 2015-09-18 23:05:06

I've seen a number of posts about this and I don't think its going to be viable long term. I certainly don't think that's what 21 inc is planning on doing as some have suggested. You have to think of this as a worldwide competition as to who is doing mining most efficiently. When you consider that, think about the advantages of a large scale operation:
1.) Economies of scale: presumably, you would get a significant discount for buying hardware in bulk, but also for buying energy in bulk.
2.) Optimization that a hobbyist would not do: there are so many parameters like maybe the cost of energy is different at different times of day, maybe you need more cooling at certain times of day. Optimal hw/sw configuration based on all other parameters, which pool to participate in. Should you merge mine, etc, etc.
3.) Downtime: a large scale operation could afford 24/7 support and have a notification system to know within seconds of a problem with any hardware and correct it. An individual cannot do that.
4.) Location of data center. Data centers can be located in places with cheap real estate, cheap energy, cheap labor, etc. A homeowner is not going to be able to change any of these things.
There are probably other things, but these are some general thoughts.

I disagree. This is best done outside of the core protocol. Dark wallet plans to implement coinshuffle and there is no reason that other wallets cannot implement this as a layer on top of core. Bitcoin core should be kept simple and we should only add things in that cannot be done in a layer above. Annonimity is not one of them.

I wouldn't say the theory is debunked. The problem is that there is *NOT* an effective creation/redemption mechanism because no one is acting as AP. I had an exchange with Barry Silbert on twitter just now and he said that the problem is that the APs have to hold the shares of the etf for 12 months before selling them. If they were allowed to do it instantly, you can bet your bottom dollar that the price would quickly converge to the NAV because the APs would be able to arbitrage it.

Point taken about 7 billion people using bitcoin, although it's within an order of magnitude easily that could potentially be doing transactions so the point stands. It's just a convenient number to use when doing these kinds of calculations. Also, keep in mind there may be many computer to computer transactions going on that could dwarf the number of transactions that involve humans. For instance, routers may compensate each other for bandwidth programmatically. I don't think the 20gb+ number is out of the question at all.

If you debate Jamie Dimon, I would lead with those two things because even if fiat improves the tech on cost and security as you've mentioned, fiat cannot complete on those two properties.

The blockchain data structure is completely unnecessary for a centralized ledger. It's much more efficient to just use a standard database. You should be able to fairly easily get thousands of transactions per second. The downside with a centralized ledger is that you end up with a monopoly. A centralized ledger is not a new innovation in any way shape or form since all ledgers were implemented this way up until bitcoin. I think the author is venturing out of his expertise.
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:12:02
I don't like regulations but I think the bitlicense encourages businesses to allow consumers to hold their private keys. Companies like blockchain.info would not need to apply for a bitcoin license. It makes it very hard for fractional reserve banking to occur and will encourage innovation to occur outside of the regulated companies. I see this as a good thing. The fiat bridge will be regulated, but we already have two good companies that allow us to go from fiat to bitcoin: circle and Coinbase.

Bitcoin is not well suited to general purpose storage of data. That's why it's important to find out what they're trying to do. Bitcoin IS very good at time stamping data (e.g. proof of existence). If they're trying to do something other than storing hashes, they are quite possibly using bitcoin in a way that it's not designed to be used. But we're really just speculating until we understand what they are trying to do.

I think they know this issue is contentious and just want to throw all the options on the table without having a debate.

Im glad you made a checksum and embedded it into the blockchain. The only thing is that from what I see you only included a json file that states how many posts satoshi made during certain time periods. You would still be able to change the contents of those posts and no one would know. Again, I am not suggesting you would do that but who knows, 50 years from now someone else could do that. What you could do to resolve this issue is to include the text of satoshi's posts in this json file. Then again embed the checksum as an op_return into the blockchain as you did the previous time. That would ensure that, as of the date of the checksum, no one has modified Satoshi's text. Also, if someone changed the text of Satoshi's posts in the more visually appealing part of your website anyone could cross reference this json file and point out the inconsistencies. I'm glad (and honored) that you are listening to me and I hope that you will make the extra effort to take it this level so that we can properly preserve Satoshi's words forever. All the best.

I like tumble bit too. The big benefit that mimblewimble has is that the transactions cancel out so you don't need to store them forever. So growth of the blockchain scales with the utxo set size as opposed to the size of all historical transactions. I guess we'll have to wait to see which technology ends up being the dominant one. I could see a scenario where tumble bit is used on the main chain for smart contracts and large transactions and mimblewimble side chain is used for most day to day transactions.

I'm getting downvoted and I assume that what I'm saying is just not being understood. What I mean is, if there is no block reward, right after a block is mined, you would have no incentive to mine right away until at least some transactions occur. So say in like 5 minutes, you know have fees that total 5 btc. It will probably be worth it for some miners to start mining the blocks (turn electricity back on). After 6 minutes other miners would start mining. Eventually after 10 minutes, probably most miners would be mining. That's the scenario I see. So, I don't see any benefit for a miner to mine right away if there are no transactions. So, I think the conclusions that the authors make are questionable.

Actually, I don't think anything needs to be added to bitcoin at all. Bitcoin allows for multiple inputs and outputs which enables coinshuffle. Confidential transactions and zerocoin would require some changes to the protocol as soft forks, but coinshuffle is good enough for essentially perfect privacy if it's done right. If governments don't understand this, they are not well informed. I don't know that I would see the question you posed as a problem. It's sort of like the internet.

I would just take the raw transcript of the nakamoto text only and do a checksum. The site can have a link to this archive with all text and checksum which is embedded in the blockchain. Then a more user friendly version of the text can be displayed on the site. Anyone who cares to check can cross reference any quote on the site in the archive to verify the archive. This way you know the text hasn't changed at least since the date of the block which contains the checksum of the archive.

It can actually be calculated. There is a cost to computing the hash of a block. There is also an expected return which is the probability of coming up with the solution times the reward (transaction fees + block reward). Today, the block reward dominates this equation because it's so much larger than the fees so miners just mine all the time even if there are no transaction fees. In the future that will not be the case and so before there are transactions to include in a block the miners will not use hashing power. If there is a negative expected roi to calculating a hash, a rational miner will stop wasting energy. It might take a few minutes before there's enough transactions to make it worth their while. This will not cause difficulty to fluctuate because difficulty is calculated over a two week period and so everything would even out.

They should be, but unfortunately, they can't. If you do the math you will understand that 7 billion people doing 1 transaction per day (which is probably an underestimate) would come out to a block size of 23 GB. That's just not feasible at the moment due to bandwidth that's available. However, lightning network ( can scale to allow 7 billion people 10 transactions per day with a block size of ~100 mb. It also solves the 10 minute confirmation problem and has the same level of security as the blockchain without introducing a trusted third party.

Thanks Greg. Yes, I know about libsecp256k1 and other improvements but I wanted it to come from his mouth. Personally, I'm stymied by the fact that people want to scale bitcoin with a hard fork, in this way after the whole Ethereum debacle. Especially, when we have such great scaling options in addition to segwit like Schnorr signatures, lightning network, etc. Also, with sidechains coming, there has to be a justification as to why we do any of this at all on the main chain, when we can substantially reduce the risk by making these changes in a sidechain. It's really astonishing the level of ignorance.

You have a right to protect yourself from harm, so if you believed that this person may have killed your friend I don't really see any moral issues with  confiscating his gun until things could be sorted out. At worst, you temporarily stole his gun from him if it turns out he was innocent, in which case, it's a fairly minor offense that I doubt he would even begrudge you doing given the circumstances. There is a model for how to deal with these sorts of issues in a logical way. It involves things like rights protection agencies and private enforcement agencies that compete with each other. If you're interested in learning more about it, look up David Friedman on youtube. There are a number of videos where he describes how it could all work in a non-coercive way.
I've had a few discussions about this type of thing on Reddit and in real life and typically it concludes with people saying something similar to what you say which is basically: if you don't like what the majority are doing move away. But, I don't think that's right. Why should people have to move away because other people in the area want to confiscate property from them? I think all the people that want to steal and extort should have to move to some place where they can live together like maybe Antarctica or something and let those of us who have morals live as we please (without harming others) in peace. Keep in mind that what happened in NAZI Germany was all done legally and they had voted Hitler into power. Also, keep in mind that if you take democracy to it's logical conclusion, you end up in a world where 51% of the people can vote to kill 49% of the people. So, there's some moral issues with democracy.
I believe there is an optimal set of laws that govern the universe and some have called this natural law. It has been shown, over and over that the freer a society, the more prosperous it is. Right now, we are so unfree that it's almost laughable and it's time for a new system. I believe Bitcoin will play a prominent role in building this new system.

Not true. With CSV the channels can stay open indefinitely. You only need to do a transaction if you want to close the channel.


Again, you can keep channels open indefinitely with the introduction of CSV. You are going by the version that doesn't have CSV which we have today.


My calc. assumed no segwit. for the order of magnitude, a factor 1.7 does not change fundamental conclusions.
Watch the video that I posted for full details, but there is no point in using a calculation that doesn't include segwit because you can't do LN without segwit. All LN transactions for LN are multisig so you get an improvement of approximately 2X for lightning network, not 1.7. 1.7 is using the current mix of multisig/non multisig. Schnorr gives you an improvement of 1.5 and Using coinjoin (as discussed in the linked video) gives you another 1.5. Also, current transactions are more like 3.333333 (assuming 2000 transactions per block which is conservative). So, you get 3.333333 * 2 * 1.5 * 1.5 which equals 15 actually. I was being conservative.


It depends if you have a cooperative closing of the channel or an uncooperative closing. If the other side of your channel cooperates, you can close the channel and open a new channel at the same time. There is no reason for the other party to not cooperate. Sure, it will happen on occasion, but it will most likely be extremely rare so assuming that you need two transactions every time is not realistic.
@_date: 2016-10-21 21:48:32
It actually doesn't matter much. So, for instance if you have a 1 minute block time, miners would gradually turn on their gear over the course of the minute. So, some would stay off for 10 seconds, some 20, etc etc.

OpenBazaar has a seller feedback system as well, but they also have the escrow process. Basically the way it works is that anyone on OpenBazaar can become a what is referred to as a notary. The notary acts as the third signer and will sign transactions in case of a dispute. When a buyer and seller agree to a transaction, they also agree on a notary for the transaction at that time. Therefore there is a market for notaries. Without this feature, I think you should consider that a seller with good feedback could do what's known as an exit scam. This is what happened at the dark market called evolution. Basically, they build up good will and reputation to they point where they have a lot of transactions in process and then run with everyone's money.

The amazing thing about OneCoin is that they have been somewhat open about what they intend to do. Amazingly they intend to have more supply than what Dr. Ruja refers to as "ripple coin". They want to have more coins than anyone else. Their users are shockingly excited about this because Dr. Ruja is going to "double" the amount of coins they have personally even though they are going to be diluted enormously in the process. To some extent, I think we have to say caveat emptor. Do your own research if you want to have complete centralized control over your coin by someone who's goal it is to have the most supply of any coin, by all means buy some.

LN channels can stay open indefinitely so not sure where you are getting 3 months from. It's possible that 3 months is the right number but you arbitrarily picked that. It's also possible that average time is much longer than 3 months for average length of channel and I don't see why you'd be closing them that often once the system stabilizes. Also, in your example you say to get 100 million users you need 8 mb blocks but I think your math is wrong. Even in your example, capacity with segwit/schnorr/coinjoin get you about 12 tps on chain. If users do an onchain transaction transaction every three months, that gets you 93 million users with your 3 month interval.

It's interesting because Bitcoin has had 3 super spikes (2011, 2013, and 2017). There were actually two in 2013, but we can count them as one for these purposes. After the 2011 spike to $32, we had a 94% decline. After the 2013 spike to $1163, we had a 87% decline. After the 2017 spike to $19666, we had a 70% decline (so far, but looks like a possible bottom). The trend is pretty clear for less volatility, but we absolutely could still see a 50% decline from $500k. In fact, that seems about what to expect actually. I guess we'll have to wait and see.

This paper has some problems in my opinion. The main issue which causes them to call for all these things (e.g. Hearn's call for all miners to register passports) is that when blocks have no reward there will be no incentive to publish the empty blocks. But obviously there will be no incentive to MINE those blocks either. MINERS will just wait until there are sufficient transactions before they spend energy looking for the solution to a block. So to me there are clear gaps in logic. This paper to me appears to be politically motivated. The point of the paper is to push all the things that OP pushed in his description: proof of stake, requiring miners to submit their passports, etc, etc. It's just a bunch of nonsense as far as I'm concerned.

There is always a possibility that we could use bzip compression to reduce the size of the bitcoins so that more can fit in the box, but it's very CPU intensive and might lead to centralization. There's an alternative proposal to use gzip compression which compresses the data less but doesn't use as much CPU. So far, there's no concensus amonst the core devs, so we're scheduling a compressing bitcoin box conference for next month to discuss the issue. Unfortunately, the small boxists are threatening and hard fork and refusing to attend the conference. Many think this is the reason for the recent drop from the $500 price.

The optimal set of laws have been determined over time through observation. It's actually the basis of our Constitution which is being ignored today. Look into natural law. Just do a Google search. It can also be thought of as don't deny anyone free will to briefly summarize. The reason you think it is too simplistic and that there is no solution is because you have been indoctrinated in public school and brain washed by the media to think that it's not possible to have a system other than the one we have. Believe it or not, for all intents and purposes there was no income tax in the United States during much of the 1800s. Also the sales taxes were minimal: we had a revolution over a 3% tax on tea that people saw as outrageous. The reason we had such a system is primarily because we had sound money in the form of a gold standard. We can fairly easy go back to such a moral system if the will of the people is there. Part of my purpose here is to raise awareness around these issues. Bitcoin actually offers an improvement over that system.

Yeah, I just meant if you wanted to be able to do it with bitcoin you have to wait for OpenBazaar. Technically, you could do it today even with bitcoin (it's a fairly straight forward 2 of 3 multisig), but there's no market for bitcoin arbiters yet and OB will introduce such a market where reputation matters. There's a clear benefit to the open bazaar model over the ebay motors model in that, there is no middleman to extract arbitrary fees with the OB method. So, with OB, there are no seller fees or escrow fees. If you buy a car for $5000 you literally pay $5000 (well maybe a $0.03 miner fee). The arbiter would only be able to charge a fee if there is a dispute.

The reason we don't have slaves is not because the majority finds it reprehensible. It's because the elites have found a more efficient system of control (central banking). In terms of modern day slavery, it's not that widespread because of the modern day improvement in the form of central banking, but some elites are old fashion I guess.
Of course all taxes are theft. I really don't understand how anyone could deny that to be honest with you. If I said something that made you think I that I no longer think that, it was not intentional. What I'm doing here is not exactly trying to convince anyone of anything. I'm pretty much just answering your questions and giving examples and explaining things. If it convinces someone than so be it, if not then that's fine too. I'm not sure why people would be turned off by a world without taxes. I really can't relate to that being a turn off because to me that's the goal. The goal is a world where everyone has free will. Until we have that, there cannot be peace.

You're right about the diminishing returns part, but you could setup some sort of escalation in mining over time. It would be a slow ramp up as asics would be expected to follow Moore's law in the long term. Many devices aren't expected to last more than two years or so anyways. In terms of recurring payments being possible without mining, sure it's possible but not without the user somehow acquiring bitcoin which today generally requires connecting to existing payment rails (like coinbase or circle).

I don't think getting to bitcoin's first billion users will be done by convincing people to use it. I think most people will come to bitcoin due to some sort of localized currency crisis (or the fear of one) in which bitcoin is the only way out. Up until this point, the bitcoin evangelism has been necessary, but it seems to me like we're beyond the tipping point where we have demonstrated why bitcoin is useful and when a currency collapses people will naturally flock to bitcoin and this cycle will repeat itself with progressively bigger currencies.

I mean, these numbers sound great and all and believe me, I know all this because I've taken advantage of the whole 401k/roth/etc, but I think what many of the people believe is that Bitcoin can become the new global monetary standard and that would be the end of not only the federal reserve (and other central banks), but also the irs, which coincidentally (or not) was founded the same year as the federal reserve. When the US was on a gold standard, the federal government didn't have an income tax. And when you think about it, how absurd is it for 300 million plus people to pool up to a third of their income? Even if you think there is some need to pool income, can't it be done on a more local level? Well, the answer is obviosly yes because there are many countries that are smaller than certain states and they seem to operate just fine. So, these benefits you listed boil down to two things: a tax break and an employer contribution. I think it's pretty clear that the employer contribution is really not a benefit. It's just a form of compensation your employer gives you. It's not some inherently better thing about the IRA system. And as we discussed, the "tax break" is only nice if we actually need federal taxes. And based on history and logic, we clearly don't as for most of US history there was not an income tax or an IRS. There are also many countries that don't have income taxes. For example Monaco is a very nice one. They also happen to have the most per capita police force.

It seems like you really want to avoid sending people to jail for not paying taxes which is great, but other things you propose are violent. For example, you mention restrictions on passport. You are basically saying pay these fees or you can't go to a geographic region. If you try to, people with guns will make sure you don't. That's coercion through violence.

I don't know how I am historically incorrect about the economics of slavery, but if you think it makes sense economically then why do we not have any slaves today? In terms of low wages in China as far as I know the workers in China are free to do any job they want so if a worker takes a low paying job it's because that's the best job they can get. There's no way to magically create a higher paying job other than transferring wealth from one individual to another, but that's collectivism and central planning which has been shown not to work.
In terms of working within the existing system, I don't think that's the best approach. I think the best approach is to vote with your dollars and use what's known as counter economics. So, it's things like buying from local shops as opposed to multi-nationals, etc. Also, I think supporting bitcoin and using it is a big part of how one can affect change for the better by helping to create a more egalitarian society that lacks the overhead of central control.

I just read BIP149 and it looks like it activates on Nov 16 (the day after the MASF expires). I still think that's premature. My preference would be to wait for Nov 15, then put out a serious proposal to have something like 1 year of potential MASF followed by a UASF flag day (e.g. Jan 1, 2019) that also requires somewhere between 50-75% of hashing power to activate. One year is a long time and it gives miners and opportunity to activate the MASF which would be a lot better IMO. UASF is like a last resort.

He's talking about capital gains tax. Basically every time you use bitcoin, it's considered a capital gain. So, in other words, it's as if you were holding bitcoin as an investment and at that moment you sold it for USD and would need to report it on your taxes as a capital gain. Let's say for example, you bought a stick of gum for $1. If you bought the bitcoin at $0.75, then you'd be expected to report a gain of $0.25 and pay tax on that gain.

I don't think the will of the people has anything to do with our current situation. There was a recent article on zerohedge that demonstrated that the average person has no say in what happens yet the elites have a lot of influence. So, I don't think this is the system that many people want at all. I think the majority of people (not necessarily you) don't really have a very good idea about what is wrong. They just know that things are not right. Let's not get into anarcho-capitalism yet, because although I think it's the ideal system (for both me, and society as a whole), as you point out it hasn't been tested. Something that has been tested is a system in which we have sound money and no income taxes and a non aggressive foreign policy. During much of the 1800s that was the system we had and there was much better  economic growth and prosperity. That was the system that built up the united States into the power house it once was. The federal government pretty much had no impact on the average person's life. I could live with that and it's probably something we should strive for. The only issue I have with it is that it appears that when you leave those minimal reminants of government that it can eventually turn into the monstrosity we have today because those who seek power can eventually corrupt it. That system is a fairly good approximation for anarcho-capitalism since for the most part there is no interference by government into the lives of most people.

The logic is so strange. We have a model to scale that can keep costs of full nodes down (i.e. segwit, ln, schnorr, etc), yet he wants big blocks when he knows it's going to cost $10k per full node.

I'm wondering why the exchanges don't state they support any bitcoin forks. If it came down to a contentious fork, there would need to be a way for users to vote by selling one side of the fork for another and an exchange could serve a purpose by allowing one to buy/sell either chain.

Yep, except Wright is not the mastermind. He's just part of the drama.
@_date: 2017-05-03 11:30:42
Ok yes I re-read it. BIP149 looks pretty good. I think adding in the 50-75% would be a plus. Also, I suspect the dates will need to be adjusted because as I said I think this should be negotiated after Nov 15.
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:56:08
Just based on gut feeling. You don't want to actually use the UASF. It would be better to have miners activate voluntarily. Waiting for the Nov 15 proposal to expire, then making a new proposal with a flag date ~1 year out just seems more reasonable to me.

Oh, interesting. thanks for pointing that out.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:03:39
The difficulty adjustment would still be 2016 blocks, but once you get a single UASF block mined, the writing will be on the wall and everyone will know those blocks will be far more valuable. In fact all other blocks will most likely be totally worthless because once 51% of miners switch, the other chain is wiped out. It will be a stampeed for the miners to implement BIP148.

@_date: 2015-11-21 12:55:40
I don't think so because BIP47 needs to happen on chain each time and the whole point of LN is that it's frequently off chain. However, there are proposals to do onion routing with LN which would address privacy concerns.

We don't need the same number of miners. Swe my other post for clarification on what I meant.
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:19:39
Whether it's good or not a chain split is inevitable on Aug 1. There is too much of an incentive for it to be created. The only way to avoid it now is if the miners decide to do the MASF of Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:22:51
Hell, I'd take $400k....
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:14:45
Think about it this way: do you think that at least a few miners and one exchange will have an incentive to do a chain split? Even if say 5% of miners go on this chain and one exchange, the split will occur. Now, which side of the chain will have more value? The stagnant side which is blocking segwit or the segwit side? If litecoin is any indication, the segwit side of the chain will be valued at 10X the value of the non-segwit side. If the segwit side is valued at 10X the non segwit side, which coin do you think the other 95% of miners will want to mine? BIP148 is a ticking timebomb that nothing can stop.
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:00:16
Yes, but I doubt they will. I think I remember them saying they'll do an invalidate block to ensure their chain remains valid to their clients.

Yeah, ya know I'm pretty pissed at the guy. He's been holding back the community for months now to his own benefit with asicboost. He could have activated segwit by the end of 2016. Sometimes you need to speak out against it. I'm a little fed up and I think everyone's been explaining this rationally for too long. He can either get on board or get forked off the network. It's really up to him. I don't see any real reason to be nice to him at this point.

It's kind of like Microsoft vs. Linux. So, its not exactly unprecedented or unusual that a corporate interest would fight open source software.

As with all ponzis, the early adopters benefit the most. I remember reading story about a lady who contributed a single paycheck to social security and went on to receive benefits as if she had contributed her whole working career. The people that get screwed are the ones that will contribute their whole life and get nothing. You seem to think that because the outcome was better for those people from the 20s and 30s it's justified. The government cannot create wealth. All they did was pull wealth from the future into the present. Let's say the social security system lasts another 100 years, why should the people of the 1940s benefited so much when the people 100 years from now will suffer so greatly?

Agree with you that to some degree bitcoin is being sold on the basis of things that could be done with the legacy system, but the fact that bitcoin is an open platform allows for innovation at the edges which is why it's implementing these features faster.

If only it were $200,000. Since I see you are posting in francisco so I assume you are a Californian. If that's the case, you will also pay up to 12.3% to California. Also, you will pay 3.8% medicare investment income tax. So in total, you'd be paying over 35% assuming you held it for more than a year. That money is not going to your "community". It's mostly going to wars that are designed to enrich the military industrial complex, a failed medical system (medicare), a failed retirement program that's actually nothing more than a ponzi scheme (social security) and a number of other worth less programs.

It probably doesn't make much sense to sell in the next 9 weeks, not only because of the halving but due to other factors as well. If you look at the last halving (late 2012), the optimal time to sell was about 1 year after it (late 2013). I have a hunch that approximately one year after this halving (around mid 2017) will be a decent point to take some profit, but the real thing to do is hold for the long term (e.g. 5-10 years+).

The thing about slavery is beyond being morally wrong, it's just bad business. Slaves don't work very hard and are not motivated. A paid workforce is better and the south would have been more prosperous without it. Enforcement of ownership rights over human beings also is not possible without government being complicit.
Another topic is that regardless of what you or I want, the reality is that the old system (of central banking and high taxation) appears to be breaking down and at the same time new systems like the internet and bitcoin are coming into being. Many people are predicting major disruption across most industries (include solar and 3d printing as well). These new systems like bitcoin and other encryption technology will change the cost effectiveness of violence such that it is much harder to impose taxation so the way I see it we are going to find out whether anarcho-capitalism works or not whether we like it or not.

In fact if the vision of bitcoin as the world reserve currency is realized, they would probably be out of business because no one would want to go into fiat in the first place.

Exchanges might not want to publicize that they support the chain split until after it happens. No reason to tip your peers off to the fact that you will be supporting both chains. The fewer competitors you have the better. This happened with eth/etc. No one announced until the chain split happened.

If you look at what happened in litecoin, it was hovering just below 75%, then the miners met, agreed and it went to over 99% for the remainder of the period. So it doesn't seem to me that it makes much difference. Either the miners agree or not.

This is very significant news. Summary of important points:
1) They will signal BIP91 and thus activate Segwit before the UASF triggers.
2) They will do a hard fork on Aug 1st.
3) They will not claim it is Bitcoin. Instead they are calling it BCC (Bitcoin Cash).
Basically, there will be a chain split on August first but no one is going to claim that this new coin is Bitcoin. I think this is really a big win for everyone. This post should be upvoted for visibility.

We actually had a gold standard up until Brenton woods in 1971 and it served the us well. Our current system is broken. People generally owned houses. I guess I'm more optimistic about a deflationary currency than you. I believe it will benefit the middle class and poor the most because of the prevention of inflation. You may not see people in their 20s qualifying for a 3% down 30 year interest only loan, but I think we can do without those anyways. People can save up a little more and families can also become closer and pool resources. Those are not bad things at all. In your proposal, why would people hold their money in the side chain? Also, why would anyone loan money in the side chain if they could get a superior return by keeping money on the main chain without loaning it out?

That's really all I wanted to know and I thank you for clearing it up so that myself and others can make a decision about whether we want to support your campaign.

No, because in that case you are using force to defend your friend against physical harm. This use of force does not violate the non-aggression principle.
Based on the example you gave about some tax being voluntary, I'm wondering if you would support the idea of allowing some people who do not want to pay tax to opt out? If so, we are in agreement. If people want to voluntarily pay a "tax", I have no problem with it, although I think calling it a tax is misleading. It's just something that a group of people wanted to contribute towards together like a co-op, which no one would object to. Where I object is when someone is forced to pay a tax that they don't want to pay for.
Lets just hypothetically say that there's a street with three houses on it. In one house, the owner has an income of $500,000. In the other two houses, the owners have an income of $50,000 each. If the two home owners get together and vote to decide that all income above $50,000 is to be taxed at a rate of 100% to be used for the community is that not theft or extortion? I realize this is an extreme example, but who's to say what amount is extortion and what amount is not extortion?

I think the difference is that only a bank can make an app for their bank. Independent developers cannot develop an app for a bank. Sure, I can choose a different bank, but how often do people really choose banks based on which one has the best app? Maybe it's becoming more common, but typically, there's another reason, like more atms, better interest rates, etc. With bitcoin, since it's an open platform, developers can compete on usability. I believe mycelium has done a good job so I use it. This is why usability will be better with bitcoin wallets than bank apps.

It's pretty clear to me that Judge Judy got this one wrong. The defendant's story adds up to me. The defendant is a bitcoin trader and the plaintiff  (unbelievably) did a wire transfer to someone who claimed to be selling a car. The scammer gave the seller's bank details and concurrently arranged to do a trade of bitcoin with the defendant. The reason I believe the defendant is that I just don't believe that anyone sophisticated enough to use bitcoin would expose their bank info in this way. It's obvious that the real scammer just used the defendant to perpetrate this crime. We need to get better judges that understand these crimes. Actually, the best option is to use multisig for these types of transactions via something like open bazaar and to have a neutral arbitrator/escrow (that cares about their reputation) to hold the funds in a 2 of 3 multisig until the transfer takes place. So, hopefully Open Bazaar is ready soon.

For a while I've had this idea that once people truly understand what bitcoin is, their main objection to it is that it is practically impossible to steal it when properly secured.

It's pretty clear that this is about scaling. The prices went up because everyone thought there was a deal to enable segwit.

If sha256 was broken, you'd probably not see it completely broken all at once. You'd probably see some way that people that know the secret could mine 5% more efficiently.

Heres my take: In 2140, the block size is 1mb + segwit. We also have much better signatures that are more space efficient like shnorr signatures and quantum safe. Pretty much every bitcoin transaction is coin join transaction and everyone uses the lightning network. The lower level transactions are pretty much only for the initial commitment transactions needed by lightning. All lightning network transactions are using onion routing so we have both a high level of anonymity and scalability on the main chain, but most people don't use it because the commitment transactions cost on the order of $1000. Almost everyone uses a two way pegged merged mined sidechain that has much more capacity. This sidechain operates the same way I described the main chain and also has well accepted annonimity. The average user does not consider these factors and has a wallet that completely abstracts out these details. Most people use a cell phone like device that has dedicated hardware which includes a bitcoin full node, lightning node, and a coin join peer all running in hardware. These devices connect to the internet using bitcoin through peer to peer arrangements that are discovered on demand and use a bitcoin based distributed drop box to store files. Miner fees more than make up for the fact that the block reward subsidy is gone.

This actually has no effect on the banks because they will pass any costs onto customers.
At 0.05% it's not very big, but that's initially. It could increase. Also, the example of 2.6% interest rate resulting in a 2.55% after this tax is imposed that they quoted in the article is a lot higher than the typical savings accounts you can get in the US. I just looked up the interest rate for a savings account at Wells Fargo and it's 0.01%, so that would result in a -0.04% interest rate for that account and for checking accounts, -0.05%.

The new regulations seem to favor the scenario where centralized parties do not control private keys. For instance, I don't think any of the wallet apps (like mycelium or blockchain.info) would be subject to the regulation however something like Mt. Gox would be subject to these rules. This encourages something that I think is good actually. The innovation will be done in the apps and services that don't control private keys.

Fiat has no limit on supply and has been printed by central banks uncontrollably in an unprecedented way in the last few years. To me, it is clearly more risky than bitcoin. It is nothing more than a worthless piece of paper and will soon be valued at less than goat shit. No one can create bitcoin other than miners who must expend the equivalent amount of energy. It is truly sound money. Real estate is only supported by the fiat debt bubible and as soon as the cheap money goes, so do real estate prices. Personally over a 10 year period, I see fiat and real estate as much more risky than bitcoin. By the way, no need for ad hominem attacks.

sidechains can be done (and already have been done) independently from sidechains. In fact, the initial white paper for sidechains was written before Segwit was even conceived. Segwit was actually first implemented in a sidechain. So this statement is absolutely false.


I'm asking from a user perspective. If I have the choice, why would I use a non-segwit transaction over a segwit transaction after it's active? I've come across absolutely no reason to do that.


Again, not from a user perspective, which I was asking, but there is absolutely nothing that prevents you from saving all signatures in the entire blockchain and many people will do just that. I question why it's important to have a signature from a block from 5 years ago that is replicated around the world.
I won't respond to every point in this post, but basically it is talking more about the macro picture as opposed to the micro picture. The arguments are questionable, but lets put them aside for a moment. In late August segwit transactions will be active so the real question is as a user (in a micro sense), why would I not use a segwit transaction in favor of a legacy transaction?
To avoid delay, I will give you my answer to this question. There is absolutely no reason why a user would not use segwit transactions. From the user perspective, there is no downside. It's just cheaper and opens up new capabilities with more advanced payment channels which can be used independently or as part of the lightning network. There's no additional risk to doing so or any other negative consequences. The only consequences are to miners who want to continue to abuse a monopoly on asicboost and continue to make the revenue from onchain transactions without any attempt to scale off chain. It's really that simple.

The thing about BIP148 is that it doesn't matter much if it is superior or inferior. The reality is a non-trivial amount of nodes are signaling for it. It's also in the economic majority's interest to activate it on August 1st. Core should accept the pull request with the flag for BIP148 or at least have a contingency plan for if it does activate.

Jefferson is alluding to government issued currency like the greenback. I actually think Bitcoin is a far superior system because, while it's better to give govt the ability to create money than private corporations, the truth is that no one should have this awesome and terrible power. With Bitcoin, no one does have this power. Miners can only create Bitcoin by expending energy and converting it to Bitcoin. That's as it should be.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:10:06
Absolutely. Schnorr signatures (and all future enhancements) should be released with 6-9 months of masf followed by a uasf flag day. Miners should understand, their job is SIGNAL readiness, NOT vote.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:31:58
This article has at least one inaccuracy:


This is not true. BIP91 requires 80%+ to activate so even if  the majority of miners signal BIP91, since antpool controls more than 20% Jihan can still block it. Also, it has to be a sustained 50%+ for BIP148 after Aug 1st. What happens before August 1st doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-07-08 17:01:16
I actually think a UASF for something like the drive chain opcode is low risk. It's an optional opcode and there's really no reason for anyone to object to it. The chain with the opcode is clearly more valuable than the other chain because there's just no downside. Therefore users will value it more. Any attempt by miners to block it will be seen as a hostile act and therefore the legacy chain will be effectively worthless. No split can occur.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:30:32
Not sure what you mean by failure. There will at the very least be a chain split because enough people are supporting BIP148 and there's enough nodes. Bitfury has said they will mine blocks for BIP148 if segwit is not activated on Aug 1st. I suppose the best case is that more than 50% of miners support BIP148 and then there will only be one chain. We'll have to see how it plays out though.

I think the assumption is that LN is a layer 2 protocol so most transactions would be done there. The exception would be notary type applications, but you can do a single transaction to notorize unlimited documents at the same time. The estimates given assume multiple channels and opening/closing on occasion I beleive.
Edit: typos
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:16:36
Bitfury has said they will mine BIP148 if the Silbert code is not ready. Once the chain exists, there will be an enormous profit motive for all miners to move to the MUCH more valuable chain.

Maybe initially for today's miners, yes. But the key is having it in the protocol because the protocol is hard to change. The miners will eventually come along when there is enough financial incentive and we can wait for that. Getting the protocol correct is a big part of the challenge.

I believe the way we will get mass adoption is through distributed internet access (including WiFi but possibly other means). Basically, I think there will be a protocol that allows people to share there internet connections and all of those locked icons for WiFi hotspots will become bitcoin signs and many small businesses will buy some cheap device that shares a WiFi hotspot to roaming customers. This will eventually put wireless carriers out of business and at that point everyone has some btc on their phones and understand that bitcoin is valuable. It can the be used for other commerce, much the way mpesa rose to prominence in Kenya. Bitmesh has done some work on this concept already.

That's how BIP91 works. It forces everyone to signal segwit thereby achieving the greater than 95% threshold to activate segwit through BIP141.

I don't recommend doing that. For me, I don't plan on selling any but I will buy some additional coins on the BIP148 side.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:21:37
In recent blocks, the fees are about 2 bitcoin. So, that means that the price of bitcoin would have to go up by 16% to justify the loss in fees. Thats also assuming fees would go completely away, which they wouldn't. Enabling of segwit would do much better than that. So, I don't think the fees are the problem.
@_date: 2015-11-26 01:47:39
Proud to be skeptical.
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:19:12
Some factors make me think it will be an even greater reaction actually. For instance, there was a lot less resistance to segwit being implemented on ltc than btc. Also, the need for it on bitcoin was much greater. Litecoin would be just fine without it. On bitcoin it would, at least partially be seen as the end of a two plus year scaling debate.

Mining will be hard to regulate because you can mine behind tor and you can move your mining activities to another location if one jurisdiction becomes hostile. But, if that happens, an alternative will form that doesn't have the problems with regulation.

You're just making platitudes and no concrete details. I personally can't see any benefit to using a non segwit transaction. From the user's perspective it does EXACTLY the same thing as a legacy transaction except cheaper. The only benefit I see is to the miners who can continue to use asicboost.
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:30:42
There are probably a lot of things. One example, which is currently relevant, is if there is a chain split due to BIP148 and the miners on the legacy chain do a 51% attack on the BIP148 chain.

They will not have the longest *valid* chain, which is what matters. If all you care about is the longest chain, then why can't the miners just create a bunch of bitcoins for themselves? It's because it wouldn't be a *valid* chain.


No, I would still be on the longest *valid* chain and the miners would be going off on an invalid chain.


Yes, that's the recourse if they miners do a 51% attack on the valid blockchain.

The higher fees will incentivize mining. With fees that high mining would be very profitable. The reason to use the main chain with very high fees is that it's the most secure and oldest chain. Notary is a good example. With notary, you can notorize multiple documents in a single transaction so if 100 people get together and each pay $10, they can notorize all 100 documents at a reasonable price. If your transferring your house I think you'd want the security of the most secure blockchain. Also, for a business, it's not that much because say you setup 5 lightning connections, that's $5000. At that point, your on the lightning network and the individual transaction fees are negligable. You can think of the $5000 as an account setup fee in a way. People will not use this chain to buy a cup of coffee though.

On a positive note: this encourages people to control their own private keys. From what I understand, it doesn't affect software/hardware only companies (like blockchain.info, trezor etc). This will also encourage the on ramps to be exclusively on ramps. This is a good thing. So, anytime coinbase introduces a new feature, they need to ask approval of nydfs. The innovation will move to companies like blockchain.info or Armory (or open source wallets like dark wallet, etc). I also like the fact that fractional reserves are illegal. That is outstanding! It should be illegal for fiat as well.
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:12:36
That was variance. At the moment around 63% of the hashpower is signaling. Unless f2pool, bwpool, and viabtc and probably at least a few other smaller pools switch over first we are unlikely to activate.

The only reason I don't think that will happen is it will result in BIP148 being activated. I think the miners prefer BIP91 because it gives an illusion that they still have some form of control.

@_date: 2017-07-18 06:36:19
The error message is correctly implemented. BIP91 was not implemented by Core and the user is properly alerted to the situation. There are multiple implementations of BIP91 and it's really not clear whether miners actually will be enforcing BIP91 or are just hard coding the version or what the heck is going on. Core should alert the user properly with this warning and not make assumptions as to what other software on the network is doing.

His statement was that BIP91 will not be enforced by all or most miners. Since miners themselves have made statements to the contrary I think it's quite a speculation. Sure they could be lying, but he totally ignores their statements in his post. Sounds like FUD to me. I don't see any upside for the miners (or at least the major ones) to not enforce BIP91. Being vigilant is good. I'm personally still running a BIP 148 node, but there's no need to scare people.

In a non-advisarial environment, yes. But we are not in that environment. Any miner who wants to cause problems can mine so single block to attempt to fork the network.

I think they (sipa, gmaxwell, etc) are underestimating the power of market forces. As of today, about 1 BIP148 block is mined per day so there are already some miners on board. That number will only go up as we approach aug 1st, esp if segwit2x fails. The real question is after a chain split what will the value of a segwit activated chain be vs. A non segwit activated chain? If you look to litecoin as a guide, the segwit chain is worth 10X the nonsegwit chain. What will miners choose when they have the choice of mining a chain with 10x the value vs. the legacy chain?
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:45:32
bitcoins have value in that they can be used to permanently store data in a unchangeable database. You know how it costs $10 to get something notorized and it's a system that relies on trusting notaries. It would also be easy to change a single page of a document or something. So at the very least bitcoin is a WAY better version of notary because you can store a hash of your document in the blockchain. That's a tremendous value actually. And guess what, you can only do it by using some of the scarce supply if bitcoins.

Thanks for the comment suckmyshlong. Possibly, I might be disappointed. I guess we'll have to wait and see. The idea that I had is that we should expect a similar result to what happened with litecoin. Pre-segwit litecoin was trading at $4 (one and a half months before segwit activated).

Who knows you could be right but I'm willing to pay for the tokens on the BIP148 side as long as they are less than 10X the legacy tokens. My guess is a lot of other people are thinking the same way. The question is: is the market going to ignore this demand? That's not what usually happens, but maybe in this case the market will just refuse to meet the demand for whatever reason. We'll just have to see what happens.

You are speculating when you say 'most'. Since several very large miners have stated they are using software that enforces BIP91, I don't see any valid basis in this statement.
Edit: parent is correct when he says nodes. I was thinking miners of which most are running BIP91.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:49:40
Yes, it would require that and that's likely to happen assuming investors value the segwit chain more than the 1mb chain. That seems likely though given what happened with litecoin after activating segwit.

The other important role for altcoins (in particular litecoin, dogecoin and a few others) is as a potential opt out from bitcoin should someone try to corrupt it. For instance if an attacker gained 50% control of mining hardware either directly or through coercion and tried to enforce white lists. Then we'd need to switch to an alt or at least threaten to do so. Right now that possibility looks remote and hence the price of bitcoin occupies something like a 97% market share.

Not true. LN can work with a sidechain as well. Not sure why you keep making these obviously false claims.


Exactly. My point is, we should not increase the block size on the main network because we can increase capacity on sidechains instead.

While bitcoin is almost exclusively used over the internet today, there are some projects where it's sent over radio waves that I've heard of. There is even a proposal to send the data from satellites so I don't think it's necessary that it is tied exclusively to the internet. In this context the statement makes sense. I think he probably meant that the impact of bitcoin will be bigger than the impact of the internet's impact as of today (including things like social media, file sharing, search, email, etc).

Sure, it's still possible, but it's a lot harder to confiscate. A lot of our legal system is based on the idea that you identify yourself as a legal entity. One of the big reasons people do that is because they want to open a bank account. This gives people a fairly easy way to avoid doing that.

It's not just about anonymity. If you reuse addresses, you are relying only on ECDSA, whereas if you dont reuse addresses you are also protected by sha and ripeMD, which are both quantum safe. ECDSA is not quantum safe and therefore if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer were available, it could steal funds in this address.

Rootstock is a bitcoin sidechain that implements Ethereum from what I understand. That's what I was trying to say before, but possibly I worded it wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-07 01:54:38
What you are saying is that if there is a 51% cabal it's not an acceptable situation to be in. To me, it really depends on what this "cabal" is doing. For instance, you could argue that there was a 95%+ cabal of miners that activated CSV and CLTV. Is that unacceptable? I don't think many people would argue that's unacceptable. But if there is a cabal of 51% who required you to scan your passport and social security card and mail it to them before they will include your transactions in a block, that's a serious problem and probably worthy of a POW change. So, that's why I say we have to wait for them to do something as opposed to just saying things.
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:33:47
They plan to implement on a bitcoin sidechain as well as in Ethereum. It would be interesting to hear them comment on rootstock since it's a sidechain that implements Ethereum.

If you are arguing that only tangible assets have value you will have a hard time. Patents, trademarks, copyrights and business methodologies all clearly have value yet they are not tangible. Bitcoin has value for the same reason other forms of money have a monetary value (the same reason people value the us dollar, at least for now until they find a superior substitute). I think you are arguing that tangible assets are always less risky than intangible assets. That is clearly not the case.
In terms of real estate, it is highly dependent on what the real estate investment is. For instance, swamp land in Florida turned out to be a very risky investment for some. I think if you are trying to say that Bitcoin has been more volatile than real estate so far and I'd have to agree with you on that, but volatility is not the same as risk although that's what many people in the financial world seem to think. Nassim Taleb's black swan clears this misconception up.

Even if people outside of the Bitcoin community see it that way it probably doesn't matter much. The forces pushing the adoption are unstoppable. It's just better than anything else for a set of use cases (currently including remittances, peer to peer decentralized payments, micro tipping, etc).

The best thing anyone can do if they want to help Bitcoin grow is to educate people.

It seems much more likely to me that LN will be operated for very low cost per transaction  (e.g. 0-1 satoshi per hop) by folks that hold a significant amount of bitcoin. These holders could include exchanges, miners, bitcoin businesses, or just hodlers. The value created by having a low cost and efficient LN would be much greater than the relatively low costs of operating a node, and therefore would be in their economic interests. The number of these 'hubs' could still be quite significant  (e.g. 10s to 100s of thousands). Normal users would just setup a channel with one or more of these hubs. This is not centralization. It just means that only certain people engage in this business. Specialization != centralization. We don't say that hot dog stand vendors are centralized just because not every single person on earth is a hot dog stand vendor.

If you buy IBM stock are you strangling it's growth because you are limiting it's suply? Of course not. The only reason you might cause problems with bitcoin is if you bought so much that the currency was no longer useful for low value transactions; for instance if you bought so much bitcoin that you drove the value of 1 satoshi to $1000 it would be hard to buy a cup of coffee, but we're a long way from there and it's also possible to fork bitcoin to increase divisibility.

I think multisig with aribiter solves this problem which open bazaar is implementing. The basic idea is you hold the money in a state where 2 of 3 people need to agree that the transaction is complete for funds to be released.  This gives you reversible transactions that are actually superior to the current system because the person who can reverse can not run away with your money or do much other than reverse the transaction or forward to seller. And they only get involved in the case of a dispute.

This type of analysis removes the point that Bitcoin miners have a long term incentive to keep the network stable. No one should be looking at this in terms of whether they'll be profitable for 2 weeks. I'm sure they can gradually plan for this, including before the halving so that there are no disruptions. After all, miner's revenue depends on a stable bitcoin. I think the doomsayers (including many from the classic camp who said if you don't switch to Classic, bitcoin will die) will have egg on their face in about two weeks from now when there's very little difficulty adjustment and the network is operating smoothly.

Yes, you're right. That would make a lot more sense. They privately mine empty BIP148 blocks for three days (keeping ahead of public BIP148 chain). Then they cause a massive reorg and wipe out all transactions on the BIP148 chain. That would probably force a proof of work change on the BIP148 chain.

Think of bitcoin as a proof of conversion of energy. Either you mine bitcoin (convert energy + capital -&gt; bitcoin) or you trade a good or service for bitcoin. So, when I pay someone bitcoin it proves that I've done something of value at some point in the past. It's much more fair than a system where a central authority can just print money at will. Theoretically, the system cannot be corrupted. If you store your bitcoin securely (using either paper wallet or hardware wallet), it's about as close as theft proof a money that is possible. I believe once hardware wallets are integrated directly into all cell phones and that technology becomes mature, bitcoin will be deemed so hard to hack, that essentially the hackers give up. Something similar was seen in the spam war between spammers and gmail (which was documented by Mike Hearn). Eventually spammers just stopped targeting gmail and moved on. At this point, we'll have a currency that is in essence theft proof, either from counterfeiters (whether by a central bank or other counterfeiters) or hackers. This will lead to much more equity throughout the world.

No anger/mocking here, that's truly what I (and i assume most here) think. The ideas that the big blockers want to implement are just bad ideas. So we say to fork so that they can still do them and stop trying to get them implemented in Bitcoin. That's a very logical thing to suggest. Obviously anyone who thinks it's a bad idea is not going to all of a sudden think it is a good idea just because it's on a fork, which was suggested. Those are two separate things.


Anyone who holds bitcoin should hope that "ChinaCoin" has some value because we will have both. Personally, I don't know what the value will be but if it's high then great. I wouldn't be surprised if the prices rises initially, but long term I don't see value.

Actually, it could be a bit longer than 37 days because even if miners run Segwit 2X that only forces activation. The activation would require 1 two week period of difficulty adjustment followed by a 2 week grace period. Both BIP148 and segwit 2X are targeted to begin aound the end of July / beginning of August and we're looking at 4 weeks later for activation. So, it's more like end of August or around 60 days.

All the bitcoin is dead articles focus on our current version of Bitcoin and the current version of software surrounding the core protocol. They don't even think about the implications of projects like OpenBazaar, DarkWallet, Storj, BitMesh, etc. Those things are impossible to do without bitcoin and will happen (even if the current batch of projects fail, new ones will sprout up to replace them). There is absolutely nothing that can stop any of them. How about the fact that bitcoin is a far superior settlement network than existing systems like fedwire (which transmits $2.7 trillion per day between the 9000 member banks that are _ALLOWED_ to participate on this settlement network)? How about international settlements? Even today Coinbase and Coins.ph are already settling in bitcoin and are able to undercut the competition significantly. The user doesn't even need to use bitcoin to enjoy this benefit. What about the fact that merchants can save somewhere between 3% - 10% on transaction costs vs. credit cards and not have a risk of chargebacks? I suppose everyone will just ignore these things and continue to use the current broken system forever and bitcoin will fail. /s

The LN logic will be implemented in hardware over time greatly reducing these risks and thus costs. It will be like holding your bitcoin in a trezor.

The reason I said it probably doesn't matter much is that on Aug 1st, BIP148 will be active and the market will dictate how much we pay the miners on each side of the fork. GBMiners along with all other miners will have to make their decision about what to signal based on those market forces.

Not true, there is a refund transaction for that very purpose. If the other side becomes hostile, you simply issue the onchain refund tx to get your funds back. That's the whole point of it. It's trustless. I think most of the people arguing against LN really just don't understand it. There has also been a lot of misinformation out there about this by people who don't want to see something like LN implemented.

Good point. The fee could even be less than a satoshi.

This moral equivalence argument is not something I buy. The big block miners are trying to turn Bitcoin into something that loses its decentralized properties that its value is derived from.

@_date: 2017-06-04 13:41:37
This. My guess is LN fees end up at either 1 satoshi per hop or 0 satoshis. The reason being is LN is a perfect competition so no one will make money but many will benefit by making it as a loss leader (miners, exchanges, large hodlers, etc). Also the cost to run a node are negligable. The only reason to even charge a satoshi is for spam protection.

The limit is 0.042 btc per payment. So you could have 100 btc in the channel but only pay a max of 0.042. The hub stealing only a problem in certain topologies and the design goals of the system are to avoid those topologies. If 32 million people start using bitcoin, 0.042 btc more than enough for everyday payments.
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:23:25
Yeah, loss leader is probably the wrong term. It's more like a free gift.
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:12:04
Why do they need to keep telling everyone they support segwit? Just fucking activate it! That's been possible since November.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:28:44
Same can be said for LN nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:52:36
Ok, maybe "free gift" is a better term. I think this thinking applies to LN though. The cost of providing LN services for free (or maybe 1 satoshi per tx to prevent spam) is negligible compared to the value it brings to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:03:52
Guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:35:00
Not necessarily. Miners can force the activation of SW, but they can't force a hardfork on un-upgraded clients.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:23:54
The Market will also value those blocks differently so miners will have to choose between higher and lower valued blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:17:45
Exactly. Look up 7th generation principal.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:22:33
Yes that probably makes sense. It will be interesting to see how the topology of the network develops. I'm sure there will be further optimization once we see what actually happens.

If they outpace the public bip148 chain, yes, but if they only allocate enough to just stay ahead, no.

Segwit will be actived by August 1st via BIP148 if the miners don't activate it earlier.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:26:57
It's pretty significant that someone mined a BIP148 block. If you want to call that a BIP148 compatible block fine. I don't see a huge distinction personally. "So it begins" is a lord of the rings reference and was said right before a major battle was fought.

All upgrades in the future should be released with a period of MASF (6 - 9 months) followed by a UASF. That will avoid the problems we've seen with segwit. Schnorr signatures are completely opt-in and have no downside whatsoever so I can't really see any reasonable objections, but who knows?

It won't be more insecure because it will attract more hash power due to it's greater value. Litecoin's price went up almost 10X as segwit was activated which demonstrates that the market puts a great deal of value behind segwit enabled blockchains. It also demonstrates that Bitcoin is resistant to attacks by malicious miners.


The reason for the delays are being demonstrated as completely absurd which is why UASF is gaining steam.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:36:14
The incentives are aligned to avoid the showdown. I suspect somehow things will come together for the better and we'll have Segwit before Aug 1st.

I don't see LN as being a big money maker. Fees on LN will quickly go to 0 as there will be a race to the bottom in terms of cost. The hardware required to run LN is minimal and big players (exchanges, miners, big holders) have an incentive to provide this service as a loss leader.
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:26:30
If that will allow segwit to get activated so be it, but I'm astonished by the level of ignorance.

There is no reliable way to tie them together.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:48:46


Blocks are full and that is the state that Bitcoin needs to be in to work properly. That means the higher paying transactions will be confirmed, but lower paying transactions will not be confirmed. That's just the brutal reality of the market. Bitcoin is currently broken for payments under $10 (maybe more than that). That's fine, maybe it will be used for bigger transactions and maybe something else will be used for other transactions. I don't know. But the more pressing concern for me is that a cartel of miners are blocking fixes to two critical security vulnerabilities: asicboost and transaction malleability. If these two vulnerabilities are addressed (both of which can be addressed by Segwit) we will be able to address your concerns with layer two technologies. Until then though, yes there are concerns.
TLDR: I'm concerned too, but for different reasons than you are.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:26:52
Segwit will activate on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:49:34
The reason I said it probably doesn't matter much is that on Aug 1st, BIP148 will be active and the market will dictate how much we pay the miners on each side of the fork. GBMiners along with all other miners will have to make their decision about what to signal based on those market forces. If miners are to activate segwit before the Aug 1st deadline, they better move fast. They need to be signaling by the end of the month at over 95% if they want to avoid a chain split.

I don't see how the BIP148 chain wins if this happens because they would be mining empty blocks and completely wipe out the chain in 3 days. The only choice would be to do a POW change and invalidate the bitmain blocks. This would effectively be a mutually assured destruction though and both chains would be hurt as a result.

The idea is that you add connections as you spend. So say you buy from purse.io, you would create a channel with them and route some of your payments through purse. Next time you buy from bitpay, maybe purse already has a route to bitpay and so you can just do a lightning tx. You're not intended to have a connection to something like a bitcoin bank.

You act like they are the only ones who have any say in the matter. Sure, the miners can go on to do that, but the other chain will persist and it will have more value than the 2X chain. Then the miners will switch back to Bitcoin instead of Segwit2X coin. I don't see how the NY agreement means they will permanently shun a more profitable chain? They will come to understand all of this and avoid it. There will be some way that they do it to save face. Not sure how it will play out, but I don't see all miners honoring the suicide pact.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:24:40

On one hand you say "miners are not middleman" and then next sentence, "they are a decentralized group of 3rd parties". That is a middleman to me. Also, they are not very decentralized as we are seeing lately. With lightning, the sender/receiver both have various connections to other nodes (kind of like when you are using bittorrent or tor). Those nodes only route messages. The versions of LN that are being worked on actively use onion routing so they have no idea who the recipient is. They're just doing their job to forward payments. You are always free to select alternate LN nodes to connect to if your current connections fail to do what they are asked to do. But the nodes have no incentive to not forward your payment. In fact, they have a disincentive because if they don't, they will not get their fee. Both systems have middlemen, but the incentives are correct so that both middlemen will perform the task that they supposed to perform.

Yep, but I suspect bitmain and co will activate segwit before Aug 1st. The key after that is to not accept their forked blocks. I see the beginnings of the fight already. The solutions on the core side are a high capacity drive chain and arguing that the segwit 2X agreement meant a 2mb block for nonsegwit txns (not the 8mb block weight some are pushing.) We have to hodl firm on these issues which I have no doubt core and the user base will ultimately prevent.

I think the bitcoin chain will be more valuable than the segwit 2X chain due to developer support and the fact that Segwit2x is so clearly a forced takeover by bad actors. The hash power would quickly move back to bitcoin from Segwit2x because it will be more profitable. The miners will see this and avoid the chain split though.

Goods are frequently given away for no cost. For instance if you go to a fast food restaurant, you can get napkins for free. That is because there just is no profit in selling napkins to fast food customers. This is what's called a loss leader. In bitcoin if I hold a significant amount of bitcoin, it will be worth it for me to contribute to the LN infrastructure at no cost. The cost of running an LN node is also so minuscule. A raspberry pi could run thousands of transactions per second. That's probably enough to support the entire network. The only purpose for charging fees would be spam protection. So I think LN fees will either be 0 satoshis per hop or 1 satoshi per hop. We'll just have to wait and see, but no one is going to be making money off of LN.

He may very well want to. He won't succeed.

No they said they would secretly mine the legacy chain. The theory is that they will not do that and instead mine the BIP148 chain.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:20:40
A kind of boat.
@_date: 2017-06-19 03:46:43
Didn't he agree in the NY agreement?
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:11:04
Premine and no cap either.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:42:30
Please go do that and leave us alone.
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:27:08


Yep, exactly.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:03:47
Without rulers, what a crazy idea. /s
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:33:03
Bitcoin.org should separate out on-ramps vs. wallets. It's completely inadvisable to use on-ramps as a wallet. If there were two separate sections and the distinction is clear and everything is spelled out that you shouldn't use on-ramps as wallets for longer than it takes to transfer to a wallet you control, we're good.

Can he pull off the French accent though?
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:41:36
Thanks for the summary.
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:56:12
Fair enough.
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:58:30
Like I said, I hope we get Segwit/Lightning/Schnorr which allows us to scale so that everyone can be their own bank, but it works just fine as settlement for banks and would be much better than our current system because banks could prove reserves. Banks would not be able to do fractional reserve so we'd solve the two real problems: central banking and fractional reserve.

Oh yeah, it's only $13mil. Chump change.....

Yep thanks.....

Anyone can change it. The question is, if they do, who will run it?


Bitcoin Core, the project most used by most full nodes, is open source.


No, but there is a team that manages bitcoin core.


The people who use their software.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:14:39
No, because after a few weeks, difficulty would adjust downwards.
@_date: 2016-07-24 02:47:51
The cost to store data I'm the blockchain is too great. Maybe if there was something like a distributed Dropbox which uses bitcoin to pay for space. But not directly on the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:57:56
Correct BIP101 was the proposal, XT was the implementation. I don't think the goal was a fork like in Ethereum, or at least I hope not. But that would have been the outcome.
@_date: 2016-07-06 05:03:11
Probably got too much attention.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:23:53
There is an incentive for them to stop fractional reserve. It's the fact that reserves can easily be proven with bitcoin. This is unlike gold and fiat. If one bank does not prove reserves, you will switch to another. In fact reserves could be proven on every block.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:16:14
It's so obvious this is the path forward. I blogged about it 1.5 years ago here:  (see second to last paragraph about sidechains).
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:03:37
I'll believe it when I see it.
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:42:17
Segwit is backwards compatible, so yes it is for validation.
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:20:51
Oh give me a break. The value of a chain with 10% hash and segwit will be significantly higher than the legacy chain. More hash power would immidiately be drawn to it until it's much higher than 50%. Also, let's not forget that UASF is nothing more than an activation mechanism for something almost everyone in the community  (including miners) have already agreed to multiple times. It only exists due to the endless delays.
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:27:28
Not true because they won't have the logic to orphan non segwit blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:42:32
Lightning and sidechains are like HTTP and FTP. Bitcoin is TCP/IP.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:56:17
I hope it's a game and we'll actually get Segwit activation before Aug 1st and thus avoid this. I think it would be seen as an attack on Bitcoin by the community. The result would be a setback probably on the order of mt gox (if not bigger). The result for Bitmain would be boycott of their product and shunning by the community moving forward.
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:25:16
If this theory became a reality, there would be a POW change and when that occurred, asicboost would be eliminated.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:32:33
What if it's in a multisig?
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:15:59
No, it's meant to be peer to peer.
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:53:31
Not true at all. Even if some govt (e.g. US) tries to say that LN nodes are subject to KYC, nodes in other geographic locations will crop up and be used. It's just like mining. It can move to favorable jurisdictions if needed.
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:50:22
Good question. Another question is what does it mean to own bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-19 03:42:47
A change from the current sha2 to another algorithm. shaw has been discussed as an option.
