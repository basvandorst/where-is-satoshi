The fact that someone else does something worse than what you want to do does not mean that what you want to do is good.
And just because someone disagrees with what you want to do doesn't make them a shill (especially when what you want to do might be illegal).

If you've been in BTC long enough to care this much about it, then you should know that it isn't sinking in the next few weeks.

Getting a little upset? 
I didn't write the original comment you are referring to. You are confused about so many aspects of this discussion.
And if your daughter, who I don't know and have never met, could actually "destroy" me in a debate (not that that is how debate should be seen to work in the first place), then she would quite obviously also be able to do the same to you. 
The fact that you automatically assume that I should feel insulted at the implication that someone who is younger than me and a female might also be better at debating than I am shows how much toxic bias you have crammed into your worldview.
Have a nice day!

But if you bought bitcoin, shouldn't the percentage swing be what is important? 
The only reason to worry about the sheer amount is if you put in more than you should have. Even then, your losses are still a percentage of what you put in.
If you can stand losing a third of the value of your holdings for a few hours, sheer amount doesn't seem to matter. And if you can't stand losing that percent, well, that just sucks no matter what math you use.

Not everything a bank does is evil. Not everything that is centralized is shit.
Don't forget that there are plenty of institutions in the bitcoin world that have done some evil things. And that the decentralized nature of the currency is what allows things like bcrash to happen.
Ripple provides a service that is useful to banks, financial institutions, and their customers. They plan on profiting from it since they are a business. Why does that make it shit?
What they are offering is faster and cheaper transactions across borders and ledgers. Why is that a bad thing?
Many major banks are run by bad people. That doesn't mean banking in general is bad.

That's not the kind of objectivity I'm talking about. I mean unbiased and open-minded perspectives, and I am talking about this particular debate, not "markets" in general.
Perhaps if we can discuss the issue without assuming one side or the other, we can, in this case, come up with a solution that is actually good for everybody.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:16:55
I don't doubt that all individuals, in every situation, have unique desires and goals. The objectivity comes in when we can find overlap in those desires and goals. 
Most on both sides believe we need to scale up, for instance.
Most on both sides want the value of their holdings to go up.
Most on both sides want a network that is safe and reliable.
Perhaps you're right and Bitcoin will HF someday. But If we were to all talk and realize that, at least the majority of us don't want that right now, wouldn't that be worth discussing? Maybe that alone could help put pressure on those that do want that, or at the very least reveal that some of their motives may not be what they claim.
Or maybe we would all talk and realize the majority of us don't seem to care, and that would be pretty informative too, especially since HFs are sometimes portrayed as a doomsday scenario.
Why not just try? Do you really think better discussion can't possibly lead to better solutions?

An *options* contract like this is usually purchased with a premium. 
So, if you agree to pay me $100 now, I will hold 1 BTC for exactly one year, and at any time between now and one year from now you can pay me another $2000 in exchange for that 1 BTC.
The premium is what I would get for selling my upside risk. Basically, without the added premium, there is no incentive for me to make this deal, since if the price is over $2000 a year from now, then it is more profitable for me to just sell on my own. If it is below $2000, you won't "exercise" the contract.
So... that's the deal OP: Pay up $100 now, and I will promise to hold 1 BTC until March 24 2018 and agree to sell it to you for $2000 any time between now and then.
We can work out all the legal details, I'd be happy to sign a contract to this effect.
Of course, if there are any legal fees involved, they are all on you.
EDIT: I should add, as far as options premiums go, $100 for a contract lasting a full year is an extremely cheap deal for you. If this were a stock that was just as volatile as BTC, the premium would more likely be *at least* $300.

I don't deny that is a very real concern (on practically every sub lately), but both r/Bitcoin and r/BTC have histories of animosity and censorship toward their opponents. Maybe a new sub that is run specifically to be less biased and to filter out flame war nonsense would help a lot of people sift through the crap and find better solutions.
Either way, thanks for discussing this with me. :)

I'm 100% with you, OP, I just don't believe $4,000 is the peak of this up-crash. 
If I understand correctly, Segwit activates on the 22nd, which means we have about 10 more days of hype and rumor-buying. My prediction is the real pull-back will be soon after activation, but who knows?

Strangers shouting "MOOOON!" is not a promise, and if you thought it was you should seriously consider letting someone else invest your money for you.
That being said, the Moon is always relative. If you bought bitcoin two days ago, this doesn't feel like the moon. If you started when 1 BTC was around $200, then we're already at Jupiter.

Don't sell. Ripple would be the middle picture. And the most likely one. XRP's blockchain isn't privatized. The Ripple company uses XRP and has a lot of it, but the currency itself is decentralized.
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:28:00
Bitcoin is the standard. It is the coin that the altcoins measure themselves against, hence the term "altcoin." Coins like Ethereum, Ripple, and Monero can do a lot of important things that Bitcoin can't. Likewise, Bitcoin can achieve things those altcoins are not very likely to achieve.
In some circumstances, it is better to pay with Dollars. In others it is better to with Euros. It will probably be the same situation with cryptos in the future, but instead of being restricted by geographical location, our restrictions will be things like scalability, settlement, confirmation times, anonymity, cross-currency conversion, etc.
We will likely have thousands if not millions of altcoins. Most of them will be scams. But some of them will have excellent uses.

No need to be extra rude. His own decisions already fucked him.
Honestly, I've thought out what I think the perfect revenge against a doubter would be.
Someday I'll meet someone who is completely and unshakably convinced that Bitcoin will fail. I'll become their friend, go out drinking with them, and just generally have a good time.
Then when that day comes, when they walk into a bar that accepts bitcoin, go to pay and their card is declined or they don't have enough cash, you know what I'll do then?
I'll buy them a beer. With Bitcoin.
And they'll say "Thanks"

My Gemini daily deposit limit was reached when the price was 2700. I'm just going to sit here biting my nails for the next 24 hours until I can buy more, hopefully below 2400.
Is there any way around that limit? Anybody from Gemini here who would lend a hodler a hand?
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:44:07
I'm still not sure I understand. 0.5 BTC now is worth exactly 0.5 BTC months from now, so as long as I'm paying $1000 for it, then neither is more or less valuable. After the initial investment is paid back, I'll still be holding but I'll be making more on top of it. How does this not work out? Can you use examples and numbers from your own experience?
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:40:02

But that fee may not have been caused by any scaling issues. It may be because self-interested parties purposefully tried to slow down the network and raise fees. The fact that those high fees you saw are gone now shows that the problem is more complex than just "we need to scale better." 
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:50:45

That's fair. But as confusing as all of this is, there is so much potential behind it. I am really looking forward to having two sets of coins, even if I end up dumping one of them. I know market forces typically balance these kinds of things out, but a naive part of my brain is celebrating because it thinks I'm going to double my money... and it might not be entirely wrong.
