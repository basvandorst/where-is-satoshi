THE WORST PART ABOUT BITCOIN IS IT IS LITERALLY TAKING MONEY FROM CHILDREN, AS SEEN IN THE OP.
$200 MAY NOT BE MUCH TO YOU, BUT ITS A LOT TO A CHILD, AND ANYONE ENCOURAGING THIS KID TO GO LONG BTC SHOULD HAVE THEIR DICK CUT OFF/VAGINA STAPLED SHIT.
coolcat, take that money out of BTC. Put it towards building a new computer, some computer science/finance books, anything educational really. I'm dead serious. 100% of the pricing of bitcoin is market manipulation. You are being duped by people who know a lot more of the story than you do. Bitcoin is not an investment, and you have been tricked into believing so by people who have an agenda to sell as many bitcoins as they possibly can.

nope, you're the shithead here. anyone encouraging a 15 year old to spend money on a completely worthless 'currency' should be shot on sight.

Why would you feel bad because you missed out on a speculative dog pile of retards throwing money at easily replicated digital coins? Can you not make money any other way?

he would have been better not fucking buying. why do people think that a security that has been moving in a straight down line for the past 6 weeks is a 'good buy'? are you convinced its suddenly going to bounce off the floor to all new heights? how the fuck can someone be so stupid? is this the first security you've ever watched, let alone traded?
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:34:08
yeah, but then the buying power of your 'currency' drops 20% each week for 6 weeks in a row
bitcoin becomes a lot more expensive when you consider the volatility. BOOM, you're a retard!
