Thank you. I'll read it now

It should work. You can report me if anything comes from it.
But if it makes you feel safer, go to it through your preferences

I work for a non-profit and we could benefit from a donation. Does anyone know how I can go about opening a BTC wallet for our office?
I sent the president the link and she said to gather the details.
OP this is amazing man. You are impacting the world and inspiring us all. This is what Bitcoin is all about. A new world and new opportunities for those who have not gotten a chance.

Some people have said that it has been this one for a couple of months now. I just found out today.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:40:00
Even when it comes to exchange pages and access to them?

Is this like an inside joke?
Im out of the loop :(

Yeah my cash example applies to my current situation and my viewpoint for a proper comparison.
And how would a paper exchange of funds go about?
Wouldn't that mean going backwards?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:45:17
I don't know. Can you?
Cell phone signal is horrible still. During the storm my phone went into "No Service" and there are still some parts of Miami where my signal will completely drop.

When I opened my account back in February it took about a day or two to be verified. 
I suggested my friend to use Gemini as well and it took him about a day to get verified (this was about two days ago)
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:55:04
Buy more
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:59:13
Because buying more does not imply putting everything you own into it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:54:55
lol ok Jaden
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:39:19
im thinking $1200 is the new ground.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:32:04
Is this real?
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:32:04
I dont know. 
Have you tried sending them a message?
I also think the type of documentation you use for verifications can impact the process.

Our main form of revenue has been through apparel. We have also managed to throw music events and that brings in money too.
Lately sales have been slow because im on my last semester of college and i havent been paying that much attention into it.
I really believe in Bitcoin. I just need to read and learn more about it. I want to be able to include the Bitcoin community with what im doing. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:59:07
