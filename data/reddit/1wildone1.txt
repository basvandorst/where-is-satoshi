Bitcoin is a fiat currency though...?
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:48:58
It has no worth because it physically cannot be used for anything, no paper currency has any real worth in terms of usefulness. Bitcoin literally cannot be used for anything else, hence only having the worth we say it has.

Three examples, case made case proven.

You said he lived in 2016 because he didn’t know bitcoin could be used at newegg and some Chinese place near you. Don’t tell me to not be dense lol

Your a fucking idiot I simply cannot fucking comprehend your ignorance.
By definition, fiat currency  “is not backed by a physical commodity”
Please point me towards its physical commodity, oh wait, that would be impossible as it doesn’t have one. Who would have thought?
Here’s some research:
Am on mobile so can’t write a full on essay but you get the point. Bitcoin has no worth aside from what we assign to it.

Pointing out grammatical mistakes in an attempt to draw the focus of the debate away from its main topic is a poor way to talk to people.
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:48:26
I never bought any if it bro, if I did I would be way more against it.

Nah, this subreddit is an echo chamber for pro-bitcoin talk, a horrible thing in any form, discouraging dissenting opinions is one of the worst things you can do for yourself, in my opinion. 
I’m not saying my opinion is the 100% correct one but you people are all to thick headed to realise that buying the dip in a more or less stock that has lost the majority of its ‘worth’ is a horrendous idea. 
You people all dream of the wealth that would come from a successful trade or investment but rarely hear about the people losing everything because your so quick to dismiss anything other than your dream as a false reality created by trolls.
Your blinding yourself to the real world and only hurting wallets, again this is all an opinion of mine, your welcome to debate it with me but my viewpoint is unlikely to change.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:54:03
I’m not butt hurt about, anything, what are you trying to get at ?
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:36:46
I believe my ignorance levels are fine as they are, bitcoin is a flawed currency but that isn’t to say other cryptos aren’t. Bitcoin was more of a trail blazer (for lack of a better word), it brought the potential of crypto currencies to the light of the media and to the average person. It’s technology is ancient in comparison to others, such as Etherium and the like, coins that are using newer methods and ways to transfer money. 
Bitcoin has had its run, people are shifting away because they are realising that that’s what everyone else is doing as they dont want to lost their money. The herd mentality of getting rich quick is what drove this currencies value and now that there are objectively better alternatives on the horizon, people are leaving in droves to start investing elsewhere. 
Crypto is a great thing,  a great idea with a great execution in most cases. But bitcoin has become dated to other currencies, as technology does.

Gold and silver are actually worth money as they have used, bitcoin does not. I’m done here, you defend it saying that everyone else is uneducated but fail to hear a second opinion, crypto is no doubt going to increase in popularity but those that think bitcoin will ever get back to where it was are the dumbest people on earth.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:55:30
Maybe ask those who bought at the 20k mark, invested their life’s savings into bitcoin and lost the majority of it. 
Maybe ask them, their friends and their families about their opinions.
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:09:51
I don’t really invest in many things to be honest, especially something as volatile as bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:49:24
I never meant to imply that it is, pretty silly how quickly you are to use your no doubt limited knowledge of the topic to use the 1 word you learnt from a 3 minute youtube tutorial and from browsing wsb.
Your opinion isn’t wanted and contributes nothing, just fuck off.

I truly feel bad for those that believe that everyone but them is wrong and a product of a corporate demon trying to convince them not to invest in imaginary internet money.
I’m what do I have a limited understanding? To be honest I believe you are the one with the lack of understanding, bitcoin has NO real value, it is used as a stock by the overwhelming majority of users, being bought and traded instead of spent on physical purchases because of everyone trying to one up each other seeking profits.
Very few places accept bitcoin and very few will in future because it is a flawed system, as with most if not all crypto currencies in my opinion. They will forever be bought and sold in search of profit instead of used to purchase goods and services, the second people realise they are wasting their time and in a lot of cases money bitcoin as a whole will no doubt collapse
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:50:01
Absolutely delusional to still think it’s worth investing in
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:47:27
Yep, because there’s no difference between it’s transfer speed and cost in comparison to other coins.
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:58:35
‘I’m the trenches’ ahahahah
The condescension from your comment doesn’t make you any more knowledgeable, investing doesn’t equate to knowledge either. All your doing is shorting, your not a master trader
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:31:27
A great sign of economic stability.

Enlighten me to your earnings, with proof please

Market cycles are a typical thing, but changing by literally $1000 in the span of 24 hours is a horrendous thing for ANYTHING currency related. 
Gold and silver will always be bought as they have inherent worth, they are used to make things. Bitcoins worth is artificial, the only worth it will ever have is what we give it.
Your a dumb cunt and it’s plain as day to see
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:50:05
“Everyone (who sold) is waiting to buy” is the dumbest fucking thing I’ve heard today, the price wouldn’t be in a ditch if people loved the coin. 
I was just browsing my feed when this post came up so naturally I opened it. How is that concept difficult to understand ?
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:59:10
Message me or reply to this comment in 1 month from today with he price change of bitcoin, I more than guarantee it will have decreased. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:46:00
Alright here we go, 
To start I have never invested in bitcoin and I’m not salty or anything that I didn’t, it’s the same as being mad for not investing in Apple or Microsoft in their early days, profit with anything similar to bitcoin or stock is never guaranteed. There could have been any number of reasons for it to either succeed or fail immediately.
The fact that you say people ‘deserved what they got’ is such a senseless phrase and an outright cunt of a way to talk about people losing money, especially when they didn’t do anything wrong. 
I believe in crypto currencies, I half by thing that they’re gonna actually be used in the future as a CURRENCY not a stock to be bought and traded only for profit. 
The whole ‘you don’t lose if you don’t sell’ is the most moronic thing I have ever heard. What happens to your ACTUAL money that can be used to buy groceries and pay for fuel that you have all sitting in bitcoin when bitcoin goes belly up? Are you still winning because you haven’t sold? No, your not as the worth of what you have is decreasing, I.e. your losing money.
You don’t lose if you don’t invest. Not a particularly hard concept to grasp, even for a kid. 
‘1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin’ god knows what this is supposed to mean to anyone. 1  dollar is 1 dollar , the worth of these apples can rise and fall, as it can with bitcoin, although FAR less extreme. Just because you have ‘1 bitcoin’ doesn’t mean anything if the worth of said bitcoin is dropping by the day, merchants won’t accept it if it’s less than what they want.
Your whole argument is flawed by your stupidity and false hope, give up on bitcoin and invest your money in some other crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:31:04
In what possible way would that ever mean it’s a good time to invest?
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:53:38
On what basis do you think bitcoin will even survive? The media hype is done, it has shit technology behind it in comparison to other currencies and is outdated. People don’t use it as a currency, it’s more or less a stock, with no real value apart from what we give it. 
It will die and you will regret your stubbornness 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:09:30
Except shutting down exchanges, stopping businesses / shops from accepting it etc.
They can’t ban it outright but they could sure drive the price into the ground
