I sold all of my BTC at ATH of around 18k because I couldn’t see it going past 20 so fast. 
After that I went balls deep into Ether and forgot about it waiting for POS. But seeing BTC keep spiraling downwards like this worries me, because if there are periods of consistent down trends, fractional reserve systems like tether might crumble under intense scrutiny, causing another pariah period for BTC until society deems it worthy again or whatever.
I’m just interested in maintaining my ether price constant

The daily volume of Coinbase is about 20-30k bitcoins on a regular day. 
15kish on slow days
And the day it hit 18k the volume was about 90k bitcoins moved in 24hrs. (Most I’ve ever seen)
So yes, moving a quarter million coins at once would be...eek!

Obviously if everyone does that, supply goes down and accounting for rising or steady demand, price would probably escalate to entice selling of assets. 
Either way, Coinbase merely acts as a broker for the buying and selling of any bitcoin that wants to be bought or sold. And because of the fees, the house Always wins.

All exchanges have different supplies and therefore slightly different demand based prices.
It also has to do with differing price walls too.
But at the end of the day, since you just buy and HODL, watching the price multiply, a few hundred dollars aren’t a big deal long term.

Segwit2x was supposed to be an initial attempt to upgrade block sizes, but it smelled fishy so there was a huge backlash and it got canceled. So now people are skeptical about block size upgrades and therefore we have the fiasco that we find ourselves in.

-starts dropping
-some people sell
-causes price to drop moar
-flash panic sell
-price drops to 15-20% sale
-at this point people who haven’t sold yet are really damn hopeless and will just hodl because YOU DONT LOSE MONEY UNTIL YOU SELL, or they are not think big clearly and continue to sell at rock fucking bottom 25% sale price.
-BTC servers overwhelmed
- then the glorious whales �� come though like fucking phoenixes and price spikes hundreds fiat up, and then every body who sold gets right back on the fucking boat.
-price spikes to another all time high.
And another one
And another one
Eventually bitcoin will reach hyper adoption, for it is not prepared for yet, and will either adapt, or succumb to BCH or some other altcoin.
I do hope core is working their asses off on lightning, because the future of BTC will have to depend on it

I mean, all the alt coins coexist already. It’s just that capital is moving out from one to the other to protest bitcoin core and the absurdity of having to pay criminally high transaction fees, and still have to wait 24+ hours when the network is congested. Obviously people are going to start valuing the blockchain that doesn’t get stuck and functions with minimal transaction fees higher. 
So until Bitcoin fixes the scaling problem, the beatings shall continue is my guess.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:51:57
Yes, but for much of the time in 2015 and 2016 Bitcoin was at the same price and had virtually no fees. It met the requirements for virtual currency perfectly, and was stable and usable.

If they don't understand it, I haven't the time to explain it to them further than I have already
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:51:56
It all comes down to supply and demand:
The problem is that the block sizes are catastrophically small at only 1 MB. This creates a bottleneck in the system, such that even if you pay the highest of high fees, there’s a chance your transaction won’t go through for 24+ hours due to block congestion. 
For the past few months, there seems to be an ideological battle ongoing between block sizes, and that’s why BTC has forked into BCH and BTG. I’m not really sure about BTG, but BCH has 8 MB block sizes so naturally it allows for easier placement of your transaction, therefore fees are significantly lower.
So there’s kind of a civil war raging right now, where brothers who were all pursuing the same goal of creating an effortless crypto universe are now fighting for control of mining power, messing up the whole concept in the short term while all of this shenanigans settles.
At the end of the day, BTC remains the only true and original bitcoin. But until something is done about block sizes, people are going to seek to rebel against high transaction fees as any already-rebellious crypto nerd would. And so until this drama is over, it’s going to be hard to get onto the blocks instantly regardless of the fee you pay, best to either HODL or cash out quickly on an exchange waiting for a better price (which can be either really risky or really rewarding-you roll the dice-)!

So how do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:44:16
I'll answer 2) first since it directly relates to 1)
Bitcoin, as a preventative measure started with 1 MB Block sizes which used to be enough for the small initial community, but has become SERIOUSLY inadequate since all blocks are full nowadays, so the only way to get your transaction processed is to pay a fee. But even if you pay the highest fee possible, you still might not even get into the next block bc of size capacity issues. 
This is why people are ranting about internal scaling to keep up with the amount of transactions desired without having to rely on EXTERNAL blocks that are not a part of bitcoin. 
But some crony Bitcoin core devs started blockstream to take care of transactions...for a higher price than even the bitcoin blockchain miners require.
We are now at a point where it would cost around 30-40 billion USD fiat to mount a spam attack on nodes PER BITCOIN HACKED, so the 1 mb block size limit at this point is pure garbage. 
But the devs refuse to increase block size because profit$ tho...

I keep seeing people bring it up, what gives the huge increase recently?
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:36:37
Nice! This is excellent information

Does localbitcoin have buying limits?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:23:55
If you say so.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:34:44
So, they did raise your rates spontaneously? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:41:01
bro this is hillarious

Because only one block of transactions can be mined every ten mins or so.
And each block is only 1000 kb in size (1MB)
That doesn't leave room for many transactions per minute does it?
Think about a bunch of people wanting to move their money around, fighting for space on the next block available...

Ether is probably the only real competitor to Bitcoin, besting it in concept and advancing the theory way forward.
I'm starting to see Bitcoin become sort of like a club where people collectively store their wealth in the most secure fiat manner possible. Of course, the more people that want to join the club and stash their money, the more the price will rise out of pure economic demand theory. Bitcoin might never make it "mainstream" per se, but it is nevertheless an indestructible form of anonymous information storage, and that very concept is very valuable. Especially with the $170 million market cap today.

they probably have 10%, which would be roughly 200 million of the 2 billion plus they claim.

I had this thought when 1 BTC was worth $4,400 at the time. This prompted me to sell ALL my altcoins for BTC, increasing my BTC hodling by 33%. 
My friends thought I was being silly for de-diversifying out of pure skepticism. A couple of days later 1 BTC was worth $5,700...the altcoins however, did not rise comparably at all
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:09:18
Any input?
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:06:33
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:20:43
Yes, but if we increase transaction capacity, how will the Blockstream turds make their profit$?
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:01:12
The more you wait, the longer it will take. It will be like trying to finish a race that keeps getting the finish line pushed further back a few bucks.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:13:10
Because it's a short term fix that gives miners too much power.

Ripple is also a good competitor to Bitcoin because of the mainstream banking adoption, but technically it doesn't use real blockchain technology, relying on a few banks acting as mega nodes (which is centralized decentralization wtf), yet it draws its value directly from Bitcoin...
I see XRP easily worth a few dollars soon...which is a great opportunity, but still worrisome.

So if you go up to millisatoshi, we end up with ten billion parts of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:12:36
What if I transfer some BTC from my wallet to my Coinbase wallet post fork, will I still have a B2X balance?
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:42:20
I'm also a biochemist. It helps me earn more money so I can buy more Bitcoin. So I can hodl some more.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:52:57
Are you saying your credit card company raised your rates because you bought a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:06:21
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:08:06
It takes 4-5 days. Is there another faster way?
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:12:04
I buy from coinbase and have been asking for BTC for my birthday and Christmas for a couple of years now. I also like to trade on the swings on gdax! 
Last night I sold half of my BTC at $5650 and rebought all back and more at $5150 during today's mini crash
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:54:39
Not gonna lie, the online convenience of paying with bitcoin is insane.

It's hard not to be anti-bitcoin core when core developers resist increasing block sizes simply so that the company they run (Blockstream) can make BANK simply attempting to process the ludicrous amount of transactions the free market demands at the moment.

If the universe expands at the speed of light, how can we possibly get anywhere unless we can transcend the cosmic speed limit. And if we could transcend the cosmic speed limit, I wouldn't be trying to explore space but rather, use the tech to make a time machine and buy more BTC for $0.13

If a company like Exxon mobile was in charge, probably not. But since Elon took over the space game, the future looks bright.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:25:34
Thanks, but the best part is that it doesn't matter if you finish the race or not. Your progress in the race will be recorded in the ledger immutably so for as long as the Internet exists. And that progress my friend, will retain *some* value
