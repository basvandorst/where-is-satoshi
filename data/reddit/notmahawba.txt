Bisq (bitsquare at the time) was where i bought my first btc. I don't fully understand why it isn't a bigger deal here. They have gone down the max decentralisation route, you always hold your own coins, and you can trade with alts and fiat. You would have thought this community would love and support something like that

And if this beverage vendors happen to be one of those parties and set themselves up for it? Almost like they expect to be paid via LN?

Market was overextended due to people holding for the fork. Fork isn't happening, market is still overextended. Normal correction, nothing just goes straight up

I had a net with my gf from may that it would maybe hit 6k by December. Makes the decline feel a lot better to me.

Hahaha there is always 1 dummy who just doesn't get it (or is paid to not get it). 
The dominant chain is bitcoin. Ergo bcash is just an alt, and one with a very poor value proposition. Enjoy your losses

Your post suggests women are for sale. Who are you to judge and look down on women? Hypocrite

Worse, he ignored everyone's warnings here, bought with money he wasn't prepared to lose close to ATH, sold at a huge loss and now wants everyone else to buy high and sell low like he did so he doesn't feel so stupid. 
All the ones shouting 'HODLing is stupid' are people who don't understand BTC and will not make any money.
It's almost like everyone here didn't tell them to only buy what you are prepared to lose and to HODL because there will be wild price fluctuations. They were warned, they were just dumb and greedy and got their fingers burned.
