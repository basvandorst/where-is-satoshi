I am fine with ppl leaving a Bank that will not allow you to spend your funds on anything you want, but Credit Card companies not allowing you to borrow money to invest in a volitle asset is completely in reason. If you held a $100 from a friend and he asked for it back, to spend it on whatever it was his money, it is way different than if he asked to borrow a $100 from you to invest in anything and hope it pans out and you get your $100 +interest on the loan back.

True, but there is usally some entity with a stake in a market from these investments.. in order to make these contracts.. otherwise they sit outside of it basically "betting on it" with no influence up or down.....

If you can HODL the 4 months til your withdrawing cap gain % drops to 15% then wait it out. Most likely the CRYPTOCURRENCY market will be up by then... or not..No one really knows... but most of us believe in longer terms about the prices......

My thoughts too..
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:05:43
No, Whales who have enough Bitcoin to affect exchanges  (BTC which is used to trade quite a bit of altcoins... whether they are invested in those or not) might have been withdrawing their stake in BITCOIN to fulfill futures orders based on lower prices from the ATH.

If you were lending any non-collateralized money at an extraordinary rate, to anyone, would you be concerned about what they wanted that money for, where it was going to be invested and if you would ever get it back with your interest attached?

Most ppl I mentioned it too still think it's like a stock and they need to have the Full current amt. Of 1 coin to get in to the blockchain

Joetromboni  Challenge to you... find just 1 person who can actually get a 20k Credit Card and can then use it to buy 1 BITCOIN... boom

The "pizza story"... one of the first real world use of Bitcoin to purchase something was 10000BTC for two pizzas.. something in the range of $37

The average person probably doesn't have $10 a month to invest in anything

It's not the "real" bitcoin. It is BITCOIN. BCash is not Bitcoin. BITCOIN IS BITCOIN. HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:12:36
Are you saying Bitcoin is completely irrelevant?  300USD Billion invested in it already would say otherwise... up or down it won't hit Zero anytime soon
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:40:43
Actually a lot of regular ppl trade futures w their investment accounts and brokers  dealing for them w $500 to start
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:38:37
No "Make it so" or "Number 1"
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:10:50
As an individual YES.. lots of restrictions. But there are other markets moving and selling or buying much larger amts than you or I can fathom...
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:17:05
No they are "grabbing" as much as they can now ...before the futures market, so that they have a lot coins to flood the market with driving down prices as there will become more BTC available increasing the supply (rather than decreasing if they held which they will do if they think demand will increase driving price up).
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:52:53
Honestly don't know how to cash out huge amts over 10k at a time on exchanges 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:08:48
As far as I know there aren't any "rules" in place to prevent outsiders from basically creating "bets" on the future price of this (up or down).. just like two boxers can't keep Vegas from creating and taking bets on their fight on who wins or loses. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:17:05
They could...but those ppl hardly even know what CRYPTOCURRENCY is...

A bitcoin is divided...LIKE 1 USD has a 50c pc, a 25c Quarter, A 10c Dime, A 5c Nickel and a 1c Penny 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:20:50
That Most ppl don't know that they can buy just a pc of Bitcoin? Is this what you mean?

Here is one support of the Buy in and price rise.. "they need some of it in order to trade, sell and manipulate with...
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:04:53
None of these are CRYPTOCURRENCY coins that can be used "YET" to buy or trade values for instantly in any major business or to an individual.. yes, fees and rate of transfer may be lower and faster than the major cryptos, but not one hardly is an "Instantly usable currency"
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:32:19
Agree with you 100%.. my point from my post was that we are reaching a point where BTC will HAVE to go to mBTC or Satoshi units as most ppl will not be able to own/have larger pcs of it
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:07:50
I actually expected a 39% crash from ATH... based on some of the past rises and dips.. this flash rise from Nov to now was unpredictable, but the rise and drops always have happened. Infancy stage still, growth spurts and learning stages.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:38:43
First words in my title... "My Thoughts on the possible"... speculation yes.. however, legality is in question, as I believe we see this type of manipulation in the regular markets unchecked 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:09:36
No question.. My Post point is that Bitcoin might have reached a value that is out of reach to most ppl... based on a significant available amount for a current investor... out of 7 Billion ppl that might want to buy a pc of, What is a 21 M coin Cap that they could currently be able to get in

FOMO : Fear Of Missing Out (buying something just because you don't want to regret not joining a wave, prices could go either direction so can result in buying at the ATH (all time high) that quickly corrects, losing short term gain 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:11:40
This is a brilliant post.. some of the top financial media ppl still can not report the basics of CRYPTOCURRENCY, which if they did 10 min of research they could find out... including things as simple as the  knowledge of Bitcoin being divisible to 100m Satoshis or that ppl don't have to buy 1 full coin to be in the market... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:01:32
Good question but my guess is at the time of the BCH fork a few million people held some bitcoin In coinbase Wallets and that means they would have a corresponding amount of BCH that should be released January 1st 2018 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:06:52
True.....But come Jan 1st.. they all will have a "magical" new wallet in their account reading x.xxxx BCH as a holding as well....
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:08:58
There should be only ever be 21 Million BITCOIN COINS ever created ...so... if you had just 1 you are one of 21 million people that would have one Coin.. So..if I now have 10% of One of them... then it should make me one of 210 million ppl possible to have 10% of One Coin.. ..
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:03:46
Yes.. if you held 1 BTC on Coinbase in August when the Fork occurred... then You will also have 1 BCash coin created at that point that Coinbase says they will issue on 1/1/18 on their exchange 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:10:16
Sorry. Yes 1/1/18........
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:07:20
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:38:44
I'm not sure... but it's possible that new money coming in could be confusing BCH and BTG for Bitcoin and ppl are buying into those, as well as long timers hedging bets in all the forks and actual Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:46:19
Correct my math is off... Just saying 10% of 1 BITCOIN that what will ever be only a 21 Million coin Cap.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:13:46
Had to have had...WHEN THE FORK HAPPENED... if you held them elsewhere you already have had access to your BCH...if you held them in Coinbase then they will issue yours on 1/1/17
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:34:58
Their statement claims a Jan 1 2018 issuance of BCH coins at the amount held at the time of the fork 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:57:33
So my understanding is coinbase will be releasing on January 1st 2018 any BCH coins that Occurred complimenting current bitcoin amount in August .... diamond doesn't even exist Yet so I'm not sure what that fork will result in or the bitcoin gold fork either not sure what coinbase is doing about these ones 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:06:06
I thought the "21 Million CLUB" was referring to anyone owning 1 coin (or more)...as At this point you have only 1 of only 21 million Bitcoin possible coins ever created...
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:16:57
The "21 Million Club" is if you have 1 Full coin.... not saying it will ever be worth 210 million .. just saying that I now have just 10 percentage Of ONE coin now.... thus only 209 million more ppl can ever have this amt? Is my math off?
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:30:36
21 Million BITCOIN COINS ever created 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:52:33
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:18:44
Meaning, you are in the 1% of non corporations that have enough of this to make something of it
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:14:57
Good for you, you 1% er!
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:54:25
So you currently have 140 bitcoins? About $532000 worth of bitcoin right now?
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:13:08
Betalovelace, 1st) I am taken aback by your downvote and attack as I thought that most Bitcoin proponents are a community of positive like minded ppl... 2nd) He has what he has because OP is about 4yrs ahead of all of us, for the most part, I started discovering bitcoin in July of 2016 when it was a $450 I did not get into bitcoin until this past may of 2017 for a tiny pc. at $1700 watching it every so often 3) I was only mentioning to OP that if he has done so well to this point he could do some of the things I mentioned. But he already has. And as he Hodles the rest he is in multi millionaire territory. Congratulations to OP. Not sure why you had to dish  negative response. Let's all just support each other.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:18:29
Yup, in 2025 we will either have a novelty  that the ppl who have some will trade amongst themselves OR a piece of a new worldwide monetary transaction system
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:10:51
Or....or...you only bought to make a quick buck and never really understood blockchain or crypto and where it might lead to.. so you lost some money in the short-term and figure you better cut and run..before you lose more...in the short-term view 
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:44:08
If he thinks OP "won the lottery", instead of studying a new technology, and taking the risk to invest and hold on to it before the rest of us, he doesn't understand what it is.  Bitcoin investing does not equal buying a lottery ticket.
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:44:22

@_date: 2018-02-02 01:43:46
Me too....I actually got in for the tech and the future of worldwide monetary transactions. And always looked at it as a 3 to 10 year investment ..not days weeks months. Started in May '17..not thinking quick money and I'm still up on my little investment. Though it is a shock of events for the most recent investors esp. Ppl who are short term who just see a $ sign quick money making investment.
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:47:56
Actually, you are inspiring... to the few of us getting into this now ...
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:22:28
So technically you had.... at today's value about $4.25 million if you had HODLed them all... uggh...still if you have a half a million now you should be using some of those to live the high life, home down payment, vehicles etc and then can bank on future returns as well with remaining .. I wish I had just 1 full coin at the moment 
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:43:27
I support all of our Bitcoin hopes and dreams.. I believe we are all part of the beginning of something great
