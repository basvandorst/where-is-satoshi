Why is there so much knee jerk fear in this community? The moment someone raises a perspective that goes against the circle jerk, the word "troll" anxiously gets thrown out as a deflection.
The whole point of my post- this system is far from trustless and much more resembles centralization than decentralization. If an entity ever takes over 51% of the network, the whole premise behind a decentralized payment network is lost-- even if an attack doesn't occur! It's the principle that people will lose "faith" in the idea of bitcoin. And people were never meant to have faith in it to begin with.
 BUT if an attack does occur it will be because people chose to believe that there isn't an incentive to do so. You must realize that the attack would likely come from an enemy of bitcoin who was no interest in its success, not some group that has 1000s of coins... This should be obvious.

Plus we are already trusting ghash not to allow themselves to breach 50%... So our trust is already 100% in a centralized entity. Explain to me how bitcoin is a trustless system. I raised these points because I was hoping somebody would raise a point I hadn't considered.

Of course it requires a financial investment to take control of Ghash pool via a buyout. But, like I said, a drop in the bucket for many entities out there that may be hostile toward bitcoin.

Meh, this is a kind of "help you sleep at night" answer. Adoption does not equal decentralization, these entities will likely grow with adoption.
Yes there will be more miners competing for the same cake, but they'll probably be using the same fork.

You never linked to the post which you are referring to

This is easy. If an entity controls 51% of hashing power, then any government in the world that wants to see Bitcoin die has one place to go. Buying out this company would be a drop in the bucket to many many governments. But ghash.io doesn't dven need to reach 51% to be an attractive buy.
So we are trusting ghash not to sell out and trusting governments not to give a damn. TRUST is the point of this post.
