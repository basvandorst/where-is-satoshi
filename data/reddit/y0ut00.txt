A random person with evidence moron.


Yes, my IQ is higher than yours. That much is abundantly clear.

Well played playa. You are sitting pretty. 


Well you did see your $85K+ profit drop to $40K+ in a matter of days...
You might not be scared, but you must be a tad bit upset and/or anxious. I've been there playa. You don't have to lie to me.

This is VERY shady by coinbase. 


No shit moron. But that won't stop retards from upvoting you.


Idiot, the guy bought the $35K worth of bitcoins on dec 9th. It hasn't cleared in a week and a half! I would have been shrieking like a banshee a week ago. 


But no worries. The morons on reddit still upvoted you. 


Yes, by coinbase. Not OP.

What you are trying to describe is realized vs unrealized loss. But either way, it is a LOSS and you are wrong in every way.


So nobody should ever sell. Everyone should hold so that everyone can win...
What level did you get in? At a 1000? My god, I can smell the fear in your post. Wonder what your mental state will be when the bids drop to 250? 100? 0? For your sake, I hope it rebounds and you can dump your bitcoins on the next bag holder...

You don't have a sell target? Also, what exchange do you use? Any recommendations?

They are probably trying to take advantage of the drop in price to buy the bitcoins at a discount and credit those to you. So they pocket the difference ( probably about $350 a bitcoin  "868 - 515"). They are trying to make a killing off the spread ( except the spread is between days ). This very shady and illegal.
Either demand ALL your money back or demand a fair price. If they are charging a fee, they should not be playing this game with you.

Amazing. You must have a high IQ.


My IQ just increased from reading such wisdom.


And yet, OP goes public with his issue and it is resolved within 7 hours. Amazing...


If you've worked at anything higher than a "fucking cashier", you'd have an idea of what is going on. After all, you are the one who was wrong and had to edit your comment to justify your stupidity.
So fuck off you worthless cockroach. Either you are affiliated with coinbase or you are a fucking moron. 
EDIT: Show me the dozens...
