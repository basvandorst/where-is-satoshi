If you leave a request for an altcoin trade up for a while it may get filled, it's a matter of enough users right now. They have spent 0 dollars on marketing

Lol, the developers behind bitcoin worked on the protocols that run the internet as we know it today. The guy who invented BitTorrent tech is a bitcoin core dev. Disruption through decentralization. Get the fuck out of here troll.

Speculation is one of the seven network effects of bitcoin. It brings in more people, which will then enhance the second network effect, which is merchants accepting and adopting bitcoin. Leading to more developers, which is another network effect, etc... It all compounds on each other and makes the whole network stronger. Go look up the network effects of bitcoin.

Shrug. I turned .1 bitcoin into 8 bitcoin on a bitcoin craps site... then kept playing and lost it all. The 8 bitcoin was worth 3k at the time. What is it now? 56k? It’s just a funny story now, no point grieving.

Forbes online articles are not the same as Forbes magazine. They are usually “contributing” writers akin to medium.
