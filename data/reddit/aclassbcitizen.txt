Explaining how glorious it is to buy through Gemini doesn't do it justice. You just have to sign up and experience it for yourself.

You're doing a great job! Dollar cost averaging and saving are your friends! Coinbase is a good place to start but you may want to consider opening an account with Gemini.

It's hyperbole... Earlier this week everyone was losing their damn minds over the mempool being at over 70K, technically, they lose their minds anytime that happens, but people were acting like their transaction was going to take 7 months to clear. For all the whining and the crying Bitcoin just keeps on keeping up.

Just crypto locker yourself.  Ransom qualifies as theft, along with blackmail, embezzlement, and extortion. You must, however, show proof of your loss. So make sure to get a receipt, or file a police report.

Firstly, if you're on any American exchange you'll need to report your activity to the IRS. Secondly, I commend the Winklevoss' for their work in this space; If they want to legitimize bitcoin within the Empire so be it. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

As an example, look at coinmarketcap.com - 80% (79.9%) of the crypto market's value is dominated by bitcoin. With that in mind, do you believe that the market should shift all value around so that there is an equal distribution of wealth among all 647 currencies listed?

Blame it on Reddit....Are you fucking kidding me?!?!?! Give me a break. That's like Donald Trump blaming the collapse of the economy on Zerohedge.

Reddit is a forum for people to bullshit on. Where the rubber hits the road is with (in no specific order) developers, miners, node operators, exchanges, buys/sellers and end users. Anyone who brings a technical argument back to "but on reddit..." is fucking retarded.
