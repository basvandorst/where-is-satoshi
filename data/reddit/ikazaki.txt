It is stuck until it confirms or it gets dropped. You can't cancel it. You can try to double-spend (re-broadcast the transaction) with a higher fee to get it confirmed faster.

Blocks are *slightly* slower, this is not the main issue.  
The mempool is full and not enough people are using segwit, that's the problem.

1) If they are paying fees it is not spam.  
2) This is working as designed and is a consequence of hard-forking and will normalize soon.  
3) Other pools are mining more empty blocks than bitmain.    
4) This has been going on on both sides for the past 2 years. It won't matter because the market doesn't care.  
Just let both chains fight it out in the free market and we will soon find out which one is Bitcoin.

I seriously doubt the NSA would spend money and resources to find out who satoshi is.

Please, for the love of god, stop saying Bitcoin is being attacked. This is utter nonsense. Everything that is happening is exactly what is supposed to happened in a decentralized world. Projects fork off, communities support their projects, and the users/market decide.  
Your energy would be better spent improving the protocol or supporting those who do in a positive way.

**It follows the money**  
  
Yes and this is exactly the point of the Nakamoto consensus.

I fail to understand how signaling for S2X and gaming EDA are related at all.
