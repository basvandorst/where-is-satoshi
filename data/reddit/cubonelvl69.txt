Your math still makes no sense. If you aren't getting 4% cash or points equivalent then it's worse to use credit

It's not. If you go by the rules of deal or no deal, the last two cases will have equal chances
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:08:47
Statistically speaking, that's incorrect. Yes, there's a 1/26 chance your case contains a million, and IF Howie removed 24 other cases for you and said either yours or the remaining had a million then it'd be much more likely the other case has a million. But in the actual rules of deal or no deal there's no guarantee that the million case is still remaining at the end, so the probability of your case having a million vs the only case left you haven't picked having a million is equal

Both cases started at a 1/26 chance, both cases ended at a 1/2 chance. The crux of the Monty hall problem is that the host removes all other options and guarantees the prize is still remaining at the end. Deal or no deal is all luck. The contestant could've chosen from the start the one case he was going to save til the end. That doesn't make it any more likely to have the million than the one he picked for his own case.

That logic makes no sense. There's $100 and $1 million on the board. I have a 1/26 chance at $100, and a 1/26 chance at a million. What's the 24/26 remaining?

Would you be willing to give each other all of your bank information including passwords, account numbers, credit card numbers, etc? If no, then you shouldn't trust each other with a shared bitcoin. Plus if you do well it's gonna make taxes a bitch. Also, the biggest reason, you don't gain anything for sharing. Just both make your own. If he doesn't pay much attention you can just tell him when you're selling and he can sell his too

That's not how statistics works, though. Let's use the example where you have 2 cases at the end. One is $100, one is $1 million. Are you saying your case has a 1/26 chance of being 100, and a 1/26 chance of being 1 million, but the other has a 1/2 chance of being 100, and a 1/2 chance of being a million? In the game deal or no deal it is not statistically any better to switch your final case or keep it

Hahaha no problem. I'd blame your teacher if they tried using that as an example 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:35:55
Again, that's not how statistics work. If I opened every case except one and there's only 1 million on the board, it's not a 1/26 chance that you got the million in your case

I bought when it first hit 5,000 this year. Then it immediately dropped down to like 3,000. Said fuck it and bought more, now I'm sitting on around 100% profit

If he cut you out of the will I doubt he'll give you a few thousand to play with

Your computer solves hard math problems that take days to get an answer. If you send in the correct answer they send you a bitcoin. That's about as ELI5 as I can get 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:36:29
Depends on how you're mining. If you wanted to mine alone you'd get a whole bitcoin to yourself, but it'd take a long time to earn one bitcoin. If you join a pool then the pool will get bitcoins constantly but you'll earn a tiny percentage.

What's the tax rate? I'm guessing it's still profitable to day trade. In the us it's like 30% tax under a year and like 15% over a year. But that's only paid towards gains.

Selling a car is actually a great example. If I'm buying/selling a used car, it'd be a pain in the ass to have like 10 grand in cash, and I would never trust a random persons $10,000 check
