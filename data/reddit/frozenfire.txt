Good job not responding to a single thing he said, instead latching onto his age as an easy way to dismiss him.

Have you heard the Good News about the block size increase?

Unrelated to the story, but bitcoinist.net has a *terrible* design. So many ads (even with Adblock), multiple overlays, etc.

Once C.W. established his "legitimacy", he likely would've used it to manipulate the market and bilk people out of their money by offering his non-existent expertise as a consultant.

What kills me is that the amount of effort necessary to obtain a large number of bitcoins was relatively negligible at some point. So even if it failed, at some point I could've mined/bought some for *nothing* and at worst it was an inconvenient failure.

An idea is an idea, regardless of your passion for it. If it's a good idea which you could execute given the resources, then it's probably an idea which others will become passionate about.
If anything, your examples demonstrate the opposite of your point. Those who came up with the ideas for search engines and social networks weren't necessarily as passionate about it as those who came after and made it big on the idea. Search engines probably started as a purely academic exercise for indexing and searching data. Someone took that idea and applied passion and resources to it, making it more valuable.

The point is that everything about what C.W. was doing and how he was doing it screamed con man. He needed to be loudly and clearly opposed, so that he couldn't defraud all of those people.

But it's only used by content thieves, just like bitcoin is only used for buying drugs.

However, once you've given your ideas to those with the means, they lose any *potential* value they have to you, because the person you gave them to has no incentive to remunerate you for your creativity.

To be fair, there are people who make their millions by doing exactly this. They get in ground floor on new technology as investors.
