No man. I'm a gen x. These labels change all the time. In the future millennials will be people who were born after the new millennium. 2000 and after so there's no way I could be a millennial. 
I was a gen x during the 80s and 90s. We didn't call anyone a millennial until after the year 2000. 
The oldest millennial is 19 imo. There was something called gen z in the late 90s but I guess they got bunched up with the millennials.  
I thought my generation was better. The 80s and 90s were tight especially when it came to music. Idk man I look at marijuana and technology  today compared to what the boomers had and I'd say it's better to live today.

I used to do it in New York before 911 and when in europe,asia,and south america. 
Places that don't accept credit cards or american cash.

You'd be surprised how many places actually accept gold. Especially small businesses.
I carry gold with me. Sometimes its my only form of payment that is accepted. It was much more common before the mid 90s.

Middle ages. No one used gold in the middle ages. They were poor plus you're the only one trolling here.

What exactly are you trying to block. That literally said nothing about people using gold to buy stuff. It just stated that people were sent by their masters to search for gold. Gold so that leaders could have and trade. It didn't say anything about people using the gold. Maybe the part about the gold rush but when the rush was over people were back to being poor.  Saying that people used gold as a currency during the middle ages is like saying that people use it today as a currency.
People back then used coins that represented a certain value.

Gold is my last resort. It's for when they don't take american cash, credit cards, or btc. I've thought about using silver but no one wants silver. You basically just carry gold and a small scale. You agree on a price and you weight out what you owe. It's like oldschool btc. The value can go up or down. 
I actually have pokemon cards but I've never tried to pay for anything with them. 
When I retire I will sell them.

Well I have a few small businesses and I am more than willing to accept gold. 
Not to burst your little bubble but gold and silver are considered legal tender all around the world. Not everywhere but in most places. Hell in the USA I know that we have a handful of states that recognize gold and silver as legal tender. 
Sorry but I call bullshit on your ignorant bullshit.

Pretty sure you're right. If they accept it the transaction maybe illegal.

No thanks! Sony used to store their players user name, address, and credit card information in plain text. They had their customers info stolen for over a decade before they realized it and decided to ask the FBI for help.

I'm pretty sure the  sa white elite know about btc. It doesn't matter if they traffic humans and rob them of their lives.
