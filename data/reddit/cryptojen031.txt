Investing in cryptocurrency will be the best time as still its still on its low price, once its hits its peak, it will be more difficult and hard for you to make it. Just sayin. Started investing since 2017 with a private miner and was able to earn big from it until now. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 17:29:54
Yes, and still looking forward to reach its peak ����

Cautious and it depends on whom and where you invest.

Ask the buyer to cancel the trade, that way you can have your coins back

Sacrifice if you want to achieve it. Invest if you want to have it.
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:48:44
From there, you can achieve your goals like what i and others did. Sacrifice, faith and eventually you will be there.
