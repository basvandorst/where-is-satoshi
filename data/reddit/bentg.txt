I actually will believe the hype because I’ve had multiple stuck transactions over the course of the last month. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:11:25
And why would there be a date and time of 1/3 on a couple of them?
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:23:11
I join in your sadness. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:32:25
But wouldn't KFC be waiting months for the transaction to get confirmed? How would the fast food place get access to the bitcoin if it's just stuck in the mempool?
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:48:32
Oof. That's annoying.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:10:26
Actually, four transactions under "last operations" say "unconfirmed" but these are from Dec 11th. What does it mean if they are unconfirmed? Where is the bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:57:43
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:33:31
For you to do this, the fee would have to be much higher than the price of the chicken. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:07:34
No. But they're appearing now again in the bread wallet. Is there any risk in resending again from bread? Any address weirdness or anything like that? Would I need to resend in the exact same amounts, or could I just send a little bit to test it?
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:20:26
I was sending from bread wallet to my Ledger. So if the transactions never got confirmed, does that mean I can try to send again from bread with a higher fee this time? Will a transaction from today nullify the transaction that didn't confirm from before? I just want to make sure I don't fuck something up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:52:43
I’ve been here three separate times before. See ya in about two years, portfolio. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:46:18
I see. Thanks for putting my mind at ease. I'll just hold on and know that the transactions will either eventually confirm or remain on my bread wallet.
Thanks, kind stranger.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:14:30
I get the confirmation part of it, but if they never get confirmed, am I able to try again and use a higher fee? What are my options?
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:29:14
What eventually cancels it...time?
Thanks for all the help.
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:35:12
So hard to keep that place try.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:33:26
Been doing it since 2013 :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:27:14
Obviously. Thus “continue to hold.”
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:35:34
Cool. Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:50:41
Never is a long time. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:27:59
This hodl shit is so GD stupid.
If you want to sell, sell. If you want to hold, hold. This isn't a fucking gladiator movie. Personally, I see this as a longterm investment, but if you don't -- if this makes you nervous -- then sell. This hodl stuff makes you guys sound like a bunch of twelve-year-old kids.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:23:04
My bad. I do have a nano S. I thought about activating it using the seed, but then I learned that this would leave me vulnerable. So I activated it as a new device...which is why I'm trying to figure out how to move the BTG from my original wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:04:43
Yes, I have the bread seed. What's the BTG wallet you'd recommend? I have a ledger nano, but I don't know how to claim my BTG with that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:51:54
You seem fun at parties. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:07:51
This is why I continue to hold. For me, this would be a much more difficult pill to swallow than if bitcoin were to crash to nothingness. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:13:05
Yeah. I mean I'd like to move it. I recently purchased a ledger nano, and I'd like to store it there.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:30:54
For me, cashing out like this guy did and taking $500 — and then seeing that you could’ve changed your life had you held — that would be too much for me to handle. So, when do I draw the line? When it’s an amount that would significantly change my life. So...I guess, more than $500. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:11:10
This is BS. Sell now and how will you feel if it’s one day at $50k/coin? I know plenty of people who could’ve been wealthy had they held on to their Apple stock. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:58:07
My BTC was stored on breadwallet before the BTG fork. Anyone know what I can use to claim my BTG? As far as I know, I can't use coinomy because I don't have an android device. Is there any other way?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:40:11
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:49:24
My Capital One VISA also denied my attempt at using Coinbase, telling me “we’re not allowed to do business with bitcoin companies.”
Needless to say I told them where to go. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:21:44
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:15:52
What a giant twat bomb. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:58:51
How do I export my private keys from my current wallet into a BTG wallet? Once I send my BTC to my ledger, does my bread wallet still hold the keys to my BTG?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:04:29
So brave. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:43:22
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:32:00
I agree with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:02:37
my nano supports btg, right? would I be able to use the nano for both purposes?
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:05:43
You in 2030: Sweet. A gallon of milk is down to $789,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:48:15
I just recently got a Ledger Nano S and am excited to use it. However, I'm a little confused about how to move my btc over to it.
Should I configure the device as a new device and simply send the btc there, or should I recover my btc from my current wallet (bread)? I want to be able to eventually get my btg, so I'm assuming I need to recover from the Bread seed...but I'm not 100% sure. This sort of thing makes me a little nervous. If I recover, what happens to my bread wallet? 
Any advice would be awesome.
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:53:26
Not that many investments would’ve given you 3,000% gains in the last 5 years. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:17:31
Love it!
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:35:08
All these high and mighties acting like they aren’t into crypto for the possibility of massive profit. Pshaw. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:48:56
Well, that's not really true since a lot of people will form an opinion about bitcoin based on what someone like Warren Buffet says.
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:41:29
Then it's probably about time that you take one.
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:39:59
I’ve been into crypto since 2013. Trust me, there was plenty of get-rich-quick back then. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 20:03:19
I happen to run a charitable organization that accepts bitcoin donations. Just saying.
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:09:41
Did you...downvote me for not knowing that??
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:01:20
No, I was saying that I actually do run a non-profit charitable organization that accepts bitcoin. But yeah, I see what you're saying.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:52:29
They own US citizens.
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:29:07
Ha. Hope you’re right. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:33:49
this guy is right. they're basically gift cards right now.
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:23:20
That's weird. I know I signed up for this a while back, and now I can't log in.
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:25:12


You know...if, like, that's what you're in to and stuff.
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:26:19
I'm unsure how you know that someone who accurately predicts something is only getting lucky. I mean, how many times would someone have to accurately predict something before you start believing there's something to it besides luck?
I see what you're saying, I'm just playing devil's advocate here.
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:29:49
This makes it sound like Ripple would be more useful than bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:50:27
JESUS CHRIST, DUDE!
Nobody is saying anything like that. All I'm saying is that there is ABSOLUTE PROOF of him saying he's not Satoshi, and there is NOT absolute proof of him saying he is Satoshi.
That's it, man. That's all I'm saying. Nothing more than that.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:05:32
the money's in your wallet...as long as you're shopping somewhere that'll accept that money. that's the point.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:15:47
Cool, this helps a lot. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:17:35
Have you ever taken an art class?
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:49:38
I'm glad you're not an asshole. Hold on to that. Don't ever let it go.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:04:08
How do people know that they belong to Satoshi?
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:30:44
Seven and six.
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:00:10
Copy-pasting from another reply: &gt; How did you "gather" that?
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:39:19
Hey, man. They're just saying that it's a he-said-she-said, but on one of the "saids," you've got actual video of the guy saying it -- and on the other "said," you don't. That's all.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:34:27
Yes, you are correct.
But the point that you're missing is that we have actual proof that the guy said "I'm not Satoshi" and we do not have actual proof that the guy said "I am Satoshi"...you know what I mean? 'Cause all we have is the reporter saying "yeah, he said it" -- she could be making that up.
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:50:52


I'd like to see that list. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:23:52
But in the way the two systems work...are they comparable?
@_date: 2014-05-28 13:51:05
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:55:42
Any time anyone accurately predicts something, it's because what they thought would happen happened. Like, if I predicted that the Yankees would win 97 games and then they ended up winning 97 games, part of it would be luck, but part of it could ALSO be that I know a lot about baseball.
No predictions would be different than this bitcoin one.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:17:30
I...I know, I know, but...I just have to: You didn't literally say "Take my money."
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:31:20


Isn't that impossible to know until 6 months have gone by? It's very possible that he did accurately predict the price of bitcoin 6 months out.
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:09:28
What's longer:  the lifespan of a star in our solar system, that video, or the NBA playoffs?
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:01:51


Amazon accepts bitcoin??
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:57:55
*Most* churches? I don't know if most churches are scammers.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:06:42
I'm not having trouble understanding the time element. All I said was that this is currently the biggest roadblock for bitcoin. I didn't say anything about it needing to happen tomorrow. And I've been "in" since 2013, which is why I'm rooting for this roadblock to be removed. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:29:08
Well, I enjoy getting responses that are thoughtful instead of insulting. Well done. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:38:29
And how exactly does it get to $10k w/out normal people getting involved?
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:43:56
The biggest roadblock for bitcoin is this garbage. There is a zero percent chance any regular Joe will ever understand 5% of what's going on. If you guys want bitcoin to become this giant currency that's worth tens of thousands of USD, it's not going to happen until weird/scary technical shit like this stops happening.
I've been following bitcoin for almost 5 years now, and I'm totally confused every time I come here. Someone needs to figure out how to make this really cool technology accessible to regular folks.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:33:08
Correct. The people in this sub do not understand how difficult this is for normal people to understand. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:10:55
The almost constant scary and confusing stuff like this fork thing. There are so many people in this sub who have no idea what's happening, if their coins are safe, is mycelium okay?, do I get twice the coins?, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:27:34
Where is the best place to sell your BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:25:05
Mmmmmmmmmmmmm I got nothin. That's a really good point. I completely agree. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:58:13
smtp, bgp, etc has a nice outer shell called Facespace that mom, dad, and aunt Sally, and laggards like me can all understand. Bitcoin does not have this, and until it does, it's not going to be what you want it to be. What I want it to be. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:14:22
Malice or not it's still sexist as shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:29:01
I didn't assume malice. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:45:11
I love bitcoin but this is as lame as it gets. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:01:32
If you’re intelligent, you wouldn’t want to be uneducated. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:12:52
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:22:34
The answer to that question is still “No. Next question.”
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:23:31
It vastly increases the chances you’ll be more educated than before. If you don’t value education for education’s sake, then yeah...I guess skip anything after 8th grade. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:07:59
Ha. Far from a preteen. Just someone who’s heard his share of bitcoin skeptics trying to get someone else to explain to them why they should invest. You should definitely invest. Just don’t look to this silly sub to make you feel good about it (see your preteen comment from earlier). Do your own research and you’ll feel much better. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:12:44
Probably because you're not 6-years-old. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:38:30
There are many similarities between bitcoin and a stock. Your ignorance is also revealing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:23:56
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:32:11
Wow. Could only get through about half of that. Jesus, dude. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:05:36
What’s the easiest way to sell your BCH? I don’t want to screw anything up. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:18:44
Again, you’re talking about money and not bettering oneself. That’s okay, but we’re not going to agree. It’s fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:49:56
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:24:21
Found the conservative. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:31:31
So you can be uneducated but at least you’ll have some money?
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:37:11
What if I want to cash out of the BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:19:07
Amazing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:28:58
If you don’t value education, we’re not going to find a whole lot of common ground. It’s okay. No worries. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:06:38
It’s not the only place, but it sure does help. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:46:33
Probably because they’re using it as a store of value. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:42:25
Okay. This is the crux of our disagreement. I would argue that one might educate oneself in order to become a better person. If money is the only plus you see to education, then yes...start working as early as possible. Skip high school. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:25:36
You sounded like you were looking to be sold on the idea of bitcoin. All I’m saying is that I don’t care whether or not you understand it or get sold on it. Buy or don’t buy.  The response you got from me was because you gave off this attitude of “you guys don’t know what you’re talking about — oh, but also tell me what I’m missing.” No. You don’t get to have it both ways. Not from me anyway.
Have a great day, kid. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:52:22
Great idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:27:15
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:31:06
Why can’t it be both?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:52:18
Not talking down anything. I simply don’t care whether or not you’re convinced of its value. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:36:48
Don’t look at anything. If you’re too lazy or uninterested to do the research, then ignore bitcoin. Treat it like a stock that you don’t want to buy. No one here will care. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:58:17
Yay for uneducated kids!
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:48:38
Okay...but in 2030, what will $500,000 be worth?
@_date: 2017-04-22 01:41:50
Yes, that was the issue. I was able to send the rest. OMG. Lots of almost puking was going on just now.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:22:50
And what if the private key is unreadable?
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:46:35
What do tits have to do with it?
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:51:57
Ahhhhhhhhhh. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:23:03
So when it prints an unreadable receipt, then what?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:14:35
I wish you luck with that.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:47:56
Posting something like this if it's true is pretty dumb. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:08:45
LocalBitCoins only works if you live near people who want your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:26:32
I'm just saying, it's not uncommon to get a bad printout or a torn receipt or it's out of paper, etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:42:11
What's the best way to learn about getting access to and selling your BTH and this other fork situation? I'll want to take advantage, but I have zero clue how to do it safely. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:45:58
Under $500 club signing in.

Wait. Is this guy Satoshi? Did I miss something?
@_date: 2019-09-15 05:38:34
“the debate” ��
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:03:19
And you don't think there's a bank used in this scenario?
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:57:06
Yeah? You can currently pay your mortgage with bitcoin? Buy a gallon of milk? A car? Your electric bill? I'm not saying that might someday be the case. I'm on your team. I want that, too. But we're not currently there. 
@_date: 2019-09-14 21:20:44
So so intelligent.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:25:48
Sure. You can look at it that way. I still need a bank if I want to sell. 
@_date: 2019-09-14 21:57:05
Bahahahaha! Did your widdle fee fees get hurted?
@_date: 2019-09-14 21:52:52
What exactly is wrong with you?
@_date: 2019-09-14 22:11:58
Reading comprehension isn’t grammar, Einstein.
@_date: 2019-09-14 17:18:35
Comparing the acceptance of bitcoin with the acceptance of alcohol — even back in the day — is pretty ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-09-14 18:46:23
You are a great internet mind.
@_date: 2019-09-14 22:08:39
No you didn’t get owned. Great reading comprehension there bud. ��
@_date: 2019-09-14 22:06:15
Oh wow. I got owned so hard. Again, you are the absolute king of the internet. Good job.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:49:19
Still need the banks if you want to sell your BTC. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:52:38
Also USBank with no coinbase issues. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:58:42
Regardless of what you think of this guy, his story is a great example of how far away bitcoin is from being something everyday people can actually use. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:35:52
It would still be sexist. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:08:49
Wow this is sexist as shit. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:47:45
Purchased my first BTC in 2013, and this shit really makes me want to sell everything. None of this is easy to understand and I have zero clue what's happening Aug 1. Frustrating.

What would happen if the US or EU or whoever decided to make using bitcoin illegal?

Bitcoin baby!

My wife and I run a small non-profit theatre company. We're planning on accepting bitcoin for ticket purchases next season. We're already accepting bitcoin donations.
I realize our mission is very specific, but if you're interested in supporting us, [here's the link](
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:19:50
Spending them is easy...for us. I can only imagine my mother trying to spend a bitcoin. Her house would implode.
I agree with you, Yorrick (Shakespeare fan?). I love the idea of bitcoin, but there's a long way to go.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:09:39
Coincidence that "coincidence" begins with "coin"? I think not.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:43:32
God, this guy is exactly like Rob Corddry.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:33:33
My wife is the one who actually convinced me to put more in. I held and believe in bitcoin (and I didn't spend more than I could afford), so even though I'm embarrassed like the rest of you, I'm still keeping positive.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:55:44
I know. I was glad for this, as well.

Can somebody help walk me through purchasing a card on Gyft with btc? I get to the payment part with the QR code, but then I don't know what to do. Am I supposed to have an app or something to send my bitcoins with??

Just be patient. It'll correct itself soon and you'll be able to buy in at a more comfortable price.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:52:10
Holy shit. I was thinking more along the lines of $500. Buncha optimists in here!

When we're generating a new address on BitCoinAddress.org, how do we know that someone's not recording all those addresses/private keys to use later? I don't get how everyone's so comfortable with this.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:53:49
This change wallet bullshit is bullshit.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:28:03
Or...at least, I would :)

My least favorite thing about bitcoin is how scary it is. I'm in absolute love with the idea behind it, so I really want it to succeed...but it's so scary to the average person.
I just wish it was easier for people to understand.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:47:25
I hope you're right. I mean, that's the only outcome I can think about now. In it for the long haul.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:50:33
What's coinjoin?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:38:10
But the point is, this volatility is really run and exciting (if you're using money you're cool losing). Where's the fun in watching an index fund slowly creep up 13% over the course of a year?
We're talking about fun, here.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:34:03
Don't worry. It's coming.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:52:10
I'd actually suggest making your own computer from parts found in your home. It's the only way to know for sure.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:34:01
Fellow MN bitcoiner also fuck-yeah-ing.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:09:51
I saw this the other day and thought it was cool. However, I am a normal and was absolutely confused as hell when I tried to understand how to do it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:33:33
It did correct back down to under $100.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:42:04
Said someone on the internet.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:35:16
Yup. I bought in at $175 in April and was like "WOW" so then I did again at $240 right before the correction. I was disappointed, but also I believed in the value of bitcoin. I still think that $907 is low.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:08:54
Simple is rad. I've been using for about a year and would recommend to everyone.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:00:11
Ahhh yeah. I wasn't knocking it. Just wondering if it would be a good thing or a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:31:45


Okay, so what happens when they *are* the victim of a DDos in the future? Jesus.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:16:44
Yes, but it's not easier to GET the Gyft card. You have to think of this as someone starting from no bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:08:07
Bitcoin will not fail when the investors cash out. They've cashed out before.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:30:54
There is a zero percent chance that's the first time you've heard that.
I'm really loving this series, btw.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:37:42
But the investors won't go away because of a crash. They'll just buy up more at the low crash prices.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:51:50
To be clear, they're very rarely using the term "bitcoin" specifically.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:17:31
God damn this seems like a giant pain in the ass. How confusing. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:51:07
This is true.
The first bitcoin I obtained was through this sub.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:24:43
How much does something like this threaten Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:54:20
This would be awesome. I run a small non-profit, and accepting bitcoin donations would be fantastic!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:03:12
It's not the numbers-watching that's fun, it's the possibility of doubling your investment in a month as opposed to five years.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:25:04
And I never said you said prices will always go up. You did, however, say prices will not go down, which is idiotic. There is a correction coming; probably a big one. You can live in a dream world where that doesn't happen. I couldn't care less.


@_date: 2013-11-12 20:07:11
What's a "halving day?"
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:26:25
At this point, isn't it though?
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:15:49
But...he bought a wooden puzzle.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:35:54
What's this tipping thing? How does that work?
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:31:47
Except Fbook and Twitter didn't follow S curves. He's just making that shit up.

You're a college professor, aren't you?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:00:42
What? What?? WHAT??? This is where the name comes from?!
I don't know which has blown my mind more: the fundamental idea behind Bitcoin, or this Mt.Gox information.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:51:47
Simple banking.
They actually sent me an email applauding me for creating a Coinbase account.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:53:12
Apply for the CC --&gt; Get CC --&gt; Make purchase
Buy bitcoin --&gt; Get bitcoin --&gt; Get Gyft card --&gt; Make purchase
Even if you say that "buy bitcoin" and "get bitcoin" are the same (which they're not if you're obtaining bitcoin the way most people do), using bitcoin/Gyft card is still only AS easy as using a CC. And most people are already way more used to the CC process.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:22:36
Is there a reason I can't find the Coinbase app on iTunes?
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:25:07
The $800 thing is a real issue, though. I was talking to another friend the other day who was very interested in the bitcoin technology and possibilities...however, he eventually said in a discouraged tone "$750 for one bitcoin? Ugh."
People want to own a whole bitcoin. As the price rises, I think this is going to be an issue. Granted, an easy one to fix, but an issue nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:43:33
45 minutes later, Dr Pepper and Cheetos!

You forgot "rinse repear rinse repeat and the exchange is bust".
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:11:44
Uh huh...
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:27:14
This will only happen when you can purchase pretty much anything with BTC. That's a ways off.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:10:22
So that would be fun, too.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:03:08
Agreed. This is some truly dumb shit right here.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:02:57
Cool, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:08:45
As someone who owns bitcoin and thinks the idea of bitcoin is fascinating and really wants bitcoin to succeed...this transaction looks fucking terrifying.
The infrastructure around this is awful.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:22:15
I'm also an online merchant (who accepts BTC, btw) and I am a owner of bitcoin (bought in at $175). But I'm still not going to be an idiot and say things like "the price will never go down." Bitcoin is an amazing technology and possibly world-changing...but can we please be a little more realistic? Sometimes this sub makes bitcoin believers sound like morons.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:01:32
Wow, thanks! I feel so fancy!!
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:57:40
Not a crash, a correction.
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:51:40
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:20:52
Pretty much nailed it (currently $183).
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:30:58
So do people full of greed.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:48:03
He was talking about Fbook and Twitter adoption, not investment. The adoption rates of those companies were not S curves. You can google it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:48:30
I've said this a couple of times now, but it bears repeating:
I use Simple banking. They actually sent me an email congratulating me on signing up for Coinbase. Simple is awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:58:47
It's from The Departed.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:17:36
This is 100% not a guy in his 80s. What a load of bullshit.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:15:21
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:31:38
This point was made by the first testimony.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:43:34
I think it's going to correct all the way down to near $500. At least that is my greedy-bitcoin-desiring hope.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:34:02
actor...36 today!
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:45:19
Would an ETF be a good thing for bitcoin? I dumb.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:41:17
Clear as mud.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:47:13
This is why Bitcoin is pretty far from being universally accepted. To a normal person like me, what you just said is 100% greek.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:17:12
The "we" I'm referring to is everyone in this sub who tracks the worth of their bitcoins in USD...which, judging by the Bitcoinity screenshots, is most.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:35:31
Why would anything happen just from moving bitcoin from one address to another?
