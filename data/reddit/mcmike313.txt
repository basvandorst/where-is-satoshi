for a transaction to be included in 60 minutes ( 6 blocks ) according to estimatefee.com it would cost 77518 satoshis (~10USD) if the price of BTC is 17100 for it to hit 1 million would be ~58 times as much so 580 usd to send 1 cent or 100 billion dollars

the function of mining bitcoin does no validation on its own, it solves a big problem which is "who gets to validate the new block" this is effectively a lotto, if you are successful you are then allowed to validate that transactions included in the block and rewarded with the transaction fees and are rewarded with the newly minted btc(currently 12.5btc).

ethereum if they successfully pull off sharding and switching to proof of stake

 - just hit 90,000 unconfirmed transactions

The miners will continue to mine bitcoin as we know it so by changing the pow algo you are forking off on your own
The 100's of millions spent on mining equipment would no long work, effectively punishing the pro core miners because of the pro unlimited miners or vice versa
What other algo would you use? Something like ethereums pow? Or pos? How secure would the gpu mining market be to support a 20 billion+ bitcoin

looks like this is part of what we see

Augur should launch in the next few weeks/months the aim afaik was to be out of beta for the election although I'm not sure if btc will be available or just eth but they accepted btc and eth for presale so should/hopefully be both

Doesn't DCG also own a stake in blockstream?

The transaction fee is set at 5.022 sat/B for that transaction
You transaction falls in the red section (5-10 sat/B) it could take some time

Quarterly contracts close on dec 14th so I assume they will kick it off dec 15th
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:52:58
I think people think that by doubling the throughput, the fees will be lower

Visa is a centralized company worth 200+ billion
Adding segwit will facilitate using btc on the ethereum Blockchain through btcrelay which imo will hurt btc price and strengthen eth

the back log is pretty big at the moment

how many TH's are they mining?
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:44:36
does the block size going from 1mb to 2mb really make it more centralised? wouldnt this just help the throughput and reduce the transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:37:53
But if someone forks bitcoin adds a 2mb base block size and reaches miner consensus, couldn't core just adopt the new 2mb base and continue to do the great development that they have been doing on top of that?
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:31:35
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:21:40
about 93% of the miners ( indicate the intention to hardfork bitcoin and increase the block size to 2mb(segwit2x) alot of the core developers want to keep it at 1mb(segwit)
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:16:39
How would you value the contribution to asic development? Wouldn't that hold some weight in them not trying to destroy the very thing they require to grow and exist long term?

not sure where you see that i have asked this question before?
@_date: 2015-11-23 00:12:11
this is on ethereum's blockchain not bitcoins

if its on coinbase they own the key not you

lending on poloniex, then i buy ETH GNT GNO and REP and occasionally reinvest back into lending....gives me something to do while im price watching and its free money
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:38:55
how do you know? the last block they mined which was like 34 blocks ago wasnt signalling?

Someone bid 144,444 eth(30mil+ usd) on silkroad.eth, 200k is cute
