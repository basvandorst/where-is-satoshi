look what up? What am i suppose to google? Try even smaller words, then you might be able to sting them together to express a complete thought!
I'm a hedge fund manager too, i sold my first hedge fund 20 years ago for 9 billion dollars. Then i got into bitcoin and i am also a reserve deputy with the local police department. Google it!

I'm not here to lie about my background and try to make people like me.  That's all you.

I live in reality.  If you take your head out of your asshole and stop pretending to be a wealthy fund manager you can join us some time right here in reality!

if you pay me bitcoin ill shut down this account and you feelings can heal.  Think about it and let me know if you want one of my bitcoin addresses to send some payment over.  $25 bucks would do the trick.
But i agree, gemini is much better than coinbase
