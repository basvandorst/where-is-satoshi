So coin base forced you to buy at a higher price? Or you missed an opportunity and are now blaming it on them?

Havelockinvestments.com. They have several mining funds that you can buy into/trade with bitcoins. Pretty reputable and some nice yield.

Oh my god that video is unbelievable. That poor reporter was trying to do anything to discredit bitcoin. Props to Trace for handling her questions like a boss, you could tell how frustrated she was.

If I knew banks were not FDIC insured, I would definitely ensure my money isn't being lent out by some psychopathic lunatic. If I knew there was a possibility of losing my money, I would want to know the risk.

The only reason people view deflation as negative is because so many people are in debt right now. Believe it or not, but the level of consumer debt during the last 100 or so years is at historical highs. Simplifying slightly, deflation encourages people to save rather than borrow, and as a result interest rates go down. Inflation encourages people to borrow rather than save, and interest rates are pushed up as a result. Which would you rather have? An economy based on people in constant debt or one where people are prudent and resourceful with their money.
@_date: 2013-05-21 22:37:30
I hardly think that use of a deflationary currency would mean an implosion of the economy. Maybe today, since debt is so prevalent, but the fundamental idea of an economy based on a deflationary currency is completely possible.
 People are ignoring the drawbacks of inflationary currencies, and the benefits of deflationary currency. Constant inflation erodes purchasing power, and eats up the value of people's savings. Inflation transfer's wealth from people living off of fixed income and savings to asset holders (land, stock, businesses etc.). Deflation increases purchasing power. Since more and more goods are produced every year, and the supply of money stays somewhat constant, everything gets cheaper. 
One of the reasons a deflationary currency was unpopular back in the time of the industrial revolution was that wages kept getting lowered as prices lowered. Even though purchasing power was increasing, people felt like they were getting cheated somehow. With an inflationary currency, people feel like they are getting richer because they get paid more each year, even though purchasing power could be decreasing. 
Deflationary currencies doesn't mean less investing either. In periods of deflation, borrowing is discouraged, but saving is also encouraged. Supply of money (available to borrow) would increase, and interest rates would lower. The system would self correct. With intelligent market participants I don't think either system would have any drastic effect on the overall well-being of a society, but one seems a little more equitable than the other.

Why does a currency need to be constantly inflated (I think you mean "devalued") in order for it to be successful? Switzerland has always been thought the best place for a person to safely store their money, and that was because their currency was pegged to gold (until 1999), thus giving one of the lowest rates of inflation. The result of people "hoarding" money is that interest rates drop, stimulating investment. The supply of money in banks goes up, and money becomes cheaper. The only reason that people dislike money that increases in value over time is because it is harder to pay back debts. Inflation punishes people who save, and destroys the normal interest rate cycle. 
Bitcoin is a safe haven for peoples money for precisely the reason that you don't like it. Having a fixed number of them makes it immune to currency devaluation. Why do you think gold has always been considered a solid place to hold wealth? In 1800, an ounce of gold cost 19 US dollars, today it costs 1600 dollars and ounce. I am led to believe that bitcoins will hold their value much better than US dollars or any other centrally controlled currency.

A) Interest rates were kept artificially low after 9/11 by central bank, flooding banks with money and causing a bubble in Real estate values (from mortgages)
B) Legislation was introduced encouraging banks to loan money to unworthy borrowers.

How do you quantify Bitcoin's intrinsic value..
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:59:05
Curious, could you provide some more insight into how transaction volume and bitcoin price are unrelated? 
And from what I can tell, this post really is just speculation. I don't think OP is claiming to be clairvoyant, just attempting to sketch in some rough boundaries of valuation to the bitcoin market.
@_date: 2013-03-20 01:28:55
Since they are growing at the same rate, supply and demand are in equilibrium? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:48:14
stop using mtgox sillies.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:30:23
Well sure, but by hoarding all our bitcoins we adjust the equilibrium price of bitcoin. The rest of the market engages in buying and selling with a limited supply, not factoring in how many bitcoins we are hoarding. On paper we suddenly become millionaires, bitcoin still sees use as a currency. Then, we can all cash out at once by making a purchase instead of using an exchange. This way, we won't rapidly devalue our wealth by overwhelming an exchange will sell orders. We get off with a bunch of goods valued at millions, and the seller is left to exchange an enormous amount of bitcoins into regular currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:23:53
Someone convince Mt Gox to quote prices in mBTC. I would imagine it would increase demand too, noobs wouldn't keep thinking that 1 BTC is the smallest amount you can purchase at a time.

Its up $100,000. And like someone else stated, its not insurance. The government prints money to pay back depositors in the event of a bank collapse. Which really just amounts to a tax on everyone holding dollars.

Yep, cheapest price you'll see for a while.

Saving of money lowers interest rates though, which is also what encourages investment. Spending is more likely to put people in debt, which has become favorable in an inflationary environment.

How do you ensure delivery in an anonymous transaction ?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:34:33
This is still gox's fault. They could have easily prevented this by instituting a minimum trade, stopping all the bots from lagging out their system. Or upgrading their system as usage increases. There was 50 minutes of lag at one point! It's appalling how long it took them even to make an official statement. Their incompetence wiped out over a billion dollars of market value in less than a day.

I've simply stopped using Mt Gox. I don't like how they require verification, and its a pain to transfer money in and out. In my opinion, people should diversify. There are a lot of other exchanges worth using.
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:09:56
I wouldn't recommend Mt Gox, they require verification, and it took me forever to get my money into the account. I use Cavirtex and do a cash deposit (takes less than a day to get your funds), but I also live in Canada.
