I can't wait to go back some day. 
We wasted too much time in Saigon when me and my friend went though. The countryside and smaller towns have to be seen as well. Also Da Lat is amazing too.

I got pretty lucky and dumped it at .35 btc. I'd imagine it will tank over the next few days when it starts moving more.

My friend did this. I laughed.

When I say that its uncommon, I know this from experience, not from what I've read. 
While I only buy personal amounts from time to time, I have friends who've spent upwards of ten grand over the last few years and have only been scammed once or twice, nothing ever seized. 
If the vendor's have good operational security, there is quite a low risk of interception. These people know how the postal centers/customs work and how to avoid detection.
And this is talking about bulk amounts. If you were ordering personal (which is all I'd reccomend really), the worst you get is a letter through your door from customs (or a 'love letter' as its refered to). 
I've never known anyone to receive a love letter, but a few people over at r/darknetmarkets have, still they are very rare. Usually it's due to shitty choice in vendor or some other reason.
I'm not saying it's risk free. But I feel that if you are an end user, buying online carries a lot less risk than going to your neighbourhood drug dealer.

It really is quite uncommon to have a package seized. It's almost completely avoidable if you research your vendors and choose wisely. 
Also, most seizures aren't worth the police time to chase down. They have no evidence that you actually bought the package and they aren't going to raid your house for the sake of an ounce or two of weed. And, if your house is completely clean, you have plausible deniability.
Edit: scroll though r/darknetmarkets from time to time if you want to get a feel for the scene.

Well, between me and the people I know who use the darknet, I wouldn't be surprised if it totalled at close to 1000 deals so far. And not once have I or anyone I know had an item seized by customs.
I don't live in the state's, but as I said, I doubt the Feds would bother chasing down anything under a pound or two of weed. 
While buying from a dealer can be safe, you can't be sure that the product isn't cut. Also if you get caught by a cop buying a personal amount, there's a good chance that they're going to write you up, whereas if you get intercepted by customs, you'll just get a love letter.
Good vendors on the dnm's delete your data as soon as they ship, plus it should be encrypted anyway so police will never have access.

Use localbitcoin if you're in a rush. That's what I do anyway.
