I dont see why there should be any problem with a ecommerce plugins in particular being paid products.  Or a lite and pro version where u give away a plugin that processes up to 1 btc a month for personal use or testing and sell a pro version for $50-$100.  If this allows ecommerce sites to eliminate a commission of 1.5 percent from places like bitpay, they get a product thats kept up to date, they have input on the features and even possibly support, there should be payment.  Otherwise, the project risks becoming outdated and eventually dies.
I vote for woocommerce storefront support too.  If u guys need to see a fairly good example that i believe is close to what everybody expects, look at the one from bitcoinway.com (gesman on github).  Currently using this and for anybody whos using some hacked solution on woocommerce and dont want the bitpay route (or have grown tired of bitpay route), id encourage looking at the bitcoinway one.  Its perfect except it uses the older electrum mpk and it uses blockchains api which causes some manual cronjob tweaking or manual cronjob running a few times a day to validate payments (really it just validates wallet balance -&amp; confirmations).  If the validation worked 100% of the time, itd be ideal.
But example of a free app.. Developememt cant be funded forever for free i wouldnt think and not enough people donate so it phases out over time and dies.
If gear had an updated, supported version of this that worked to suto validate in woocommerce, i vant see why any ecommerce store wouldnt buy it.
Im confused tho.. Some of u guys indiciated gear already is ready for woocommerce plugin?  Or just non-woo wordpress plugin?  Or something totally different?
