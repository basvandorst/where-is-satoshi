It is actually not that bad, if some regulation was inevitable, this is as good as it gets. Besides, this gives the clarity (or more clarity at least) to many big players and institutions sitting in the sidelines ready to jump in.

Definitely, They can't increase them without bursting the bubble. The only thing they can do now is more QE, but even that may not be enough anymore what is unavoidable. I'm actually surprised with how longer they have delayed and hoe big they have inflated the bubble.

That is why you don't do it that way, when there are much safer options. It is absurd to blame somebody for pointing out a vulnerability. By doing this Chenpeng is saving thousands of people from becoming victims of another MtGox.

The "melodrama" is just in your own interpretation/reflection. My own would be more like a philosophical 'introspection' into what it is supposed to be 'out' of you it really comes from inside, then, you can control it, since it is yourself looking in the mirror...you don't wait anymore for the reflection to smile and be nice to you, you smile first.
