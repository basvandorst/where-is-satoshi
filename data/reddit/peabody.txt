This is exactly it in one sentence. They're blaming a known problem with the protocol as if no one could have possibly known how to work around it. It is incredibly disingenuous of them.

My understanding of (and one of the problem with) PGP PKI is anyone can add entries to public keys posted to key servers.  Never trust any part of a public key that isn't self signed by the originating private key.

Nope. We're in an age of the Internet where even mundane websites should be using ssl. Plain text traffic just doesn't make sense.

How long was your password for your blockchain account?  Did you reuse the password for it anywhere else?  Basically the copy sent to your email account is AES encrypted (a strong, uncrackable industry standard encryption), but the encryption is only as strong as the password.  A short password (8-10 characters) adhering to password patterns (such as the rock you password list) could be dictionary attacked in a short time.  You want to make sure you're using 20+ long character passwords randomly generated which would make brute force cracking it effectively impossible.
Don't listen to these folks harping on 2FA so much.  The 2FA doesn't add to the encryption, it simply makes it so people can't download the wallet without the 2FA even if they knew your password.  What everyone seems to be forgetting is that if an attacker knew your password and had a copy of your encrypted wallet the 2FA would be worthless anyways.
The really important part is the strong password.  2FA can help but it doesn't provide any protection against the copy in your email or any backups on your own hard drive.

I've got about $500 usd sitting in my gox account right now. Should I withdraw and wait the 2 months or so that it takes to get my money, or should I wait and see if the price collapses, buy Btc and get out? Just curious. I honestly don't mind waiting as I got other money I can invest with. It just sounded like some people have been waiting so long it doesn't look as though they're ever getting their money back.

Yep.  This.  The git version control system assumes the sha-1 hash uniquely identifies an object.  You see this all over the place regarding hashes.

And if they are running a fractional exchange, what then?  Not like you can really do much about it other than attempt to move your dollars out.
The lure of re-investing funds is likely to be too great for many to avoid.

I've had two of these spend into my blockchain address.  The transactions are not confirmed for sometime now.  While I'd like to believe the research argument, the addresses themselves are rather humorous vanity addresses.  I find that odd:

Selective enforcement
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:48:57
That's just it. The issue really isn't with the protocol, it's with Gox's handling of the protocol.  They're using Transaction ids of unconfirmed transactions for tracking their books. Plenty of devs in the bitcoin community have said "don't do that." 
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:16:58
I've wondered about this.  I see signs at lots of restaraunts in California stating that there will be a fee for using credit cards if the transaction is less than some amount (like $20 or $25).  If I were a business owner I'd simply try and price things opaquely so I was getting my desired return even with credit card fees regardless of payment method.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:26:57
Just keep track of the inputs outputs and signature of the transaction rather than the transaction id. Those can't change without the private key of the spender being compromised.

Weak sauce rationalizing. Remember when iTunes first came out (back before the days of os x and the iTunes Store) and how up in arms the music industry was over it? They wanted ripping cds to be illegal, but Apple didn't care, they just wanted their customers to have a nice product. Bitcoin is not illegal in the vast majority of regions where the iPhone is sold. There's no good reason for them to take some sort of proactive stance in banning bitcoin other than to serve their own agenda. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:38:18
To play devil's advocate...
They may not have known the extent of the problem at the time.  My understanding is that they were entirely trusting their own internal accounting to determine how much BTC they had.  When they finally began reconciling their accounts against the blockchain they realized they'd been robbed hopelessly beyond ever being able to re-open.
Completely incompetent of them, but does not mean they intended to mislead with this comment.

Wallets, none because it's not an actual double spend problem of the block chain itself and all wallet software I'm aware of catches up with the Blockchain eventually. Exchanges, who knows, but I'm willing to bet now that this problem is so public that any other exchanges which have this same problem won't be standing much longer. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:56:34
Thanks for that link.  If I understand correctly, this would only provide additional information about my identity if it managed to dust an old address without a balance which then became part of a later spend transaction from me.  Essentially the fact the dusted address was part of a spend would "link" the two addresses as being associated.  It would seem to me that general bitcoin transactions involving multiple addresses from my wallet would already be implying this association without the need for someone to dust them.
It would seem to me the latter possibility you mention would be a more likelier situation, although the seer number of outputs in the transaction would seem to be a red flag.  Not sure how it would make coins spent from that address less suspect.  I would assume a slow trickle of small isolated transactions to different addresses would better mask the possibility of an illicit funding source.

By which they mean "No"
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:39:11
No it doesn't. Transaction malleablility is simply the act of rebroadcasting an existing transaction to the bitcoin network with a different transaction ID.  It's not a double spend on the bitcoin network as the inputs and outputs of the transaction are the same and a subsequent attempting to spend the same thing would be rejected by miners. It's a problem for Gox because they've been assuming in their code that transaction ids are a reliable way to track unconfirmed transactions. They're not.

Someone offering this incentive does not understand how programming works.  This is the perfect recipe to get untalented people to contribute crap code one meaningless trickle at a time.

It does not require someone be intercepting their network traffic to pull this off.  Transaction propagation among bitcoin nodes is very fast (transactions are almost instantly seen on blockchain.info the moment they occur).  The minute you see a transaction you can attempt a re-broadcast.  What transactions end up in a block is entirely at the discretion of miners.  There's no guaranteeing an older transaction is committed to the blockchain first.  Malicious miners could have been ignoring Gox's transactions and only chosen to include their own.
On top of that Gox was predictably creating flawed transactions via their implementation.    It was clear that they weren't handling corner cases correctly, such as waiting for 100 confirmations on newly minted coins (block reward inputs, see:   The problem was compounding because it was clear they also weren't spot checking their account balances against the block chain and and as a result were attempting to spend from exhausted inputs.  All of this made it easy to remotely exploit Gox to try and get them to double-credit the exploiters.

Yeah I'm leery of all asic companies. It's much more lucrative of them to hang onto your equipment and to use it themselves than to give it to you. 
I eventually got my 5gh ($288) after six months. It's only managed to mine about $200 since October and that's not counting electricity costs.

It lets you scam credit from anyone using some kind of credit balance outside the blockchain.  Not a big concern to individual owners of bitcoin, but it's a concern to anyone running any sort of external accounting of bitcoin balances.

Your software is awesome. I used it to stream my extra-life game marathon to twitch. The nature of open source software is stuff like this is bound to happen and you are in no way culpable or even owe anybody an apology.  At one time cygwin dlls were being distributed with malware  because bots were written using the framework, but that caused some very short sighted virus software to identify any legitimate cygwin installation as malware. The day will come when you get users reporting that their stupid anti-virus software reported Obs as malware. Take it with a grain of salt, use gpg signatures on your releases to reassure people, etc. Don't let the bad guys keep you down and keep coding!

I could see an optional extension to the TOR protocol whereby payment packets are sent every once in a while demonstrating proof of funds in a designated exit node escrow address.  If the node then provably demonstrates additonal bandwidth opening up to the client, the client can then release the funds.  Provided the client releases the funds, the exit node operator keeps the heavy faucet running for extended period of time.
The logistics are probably nightmarish and it'll take a lot of experimentations but I can't see why smart minds wouldn't eventually be able to come up with something that pragmatically provides quality of service in a good number of circumstances.

They were getting a cut, yes, outside the in-app purchase mechanism provided by Google Play services.  I can't say whether that's the reason Google pulled the plug.

You didn't make WhatsApp, the WhatsApp developers did.  WhatsApp charges you $1 a year via in-app purchase for WhatsApp use (after the first free year) and it is my understanding that Google does indeed get a cut of that fee since the WhatsApp people are charging it in an App distributed by Google Play.
