I think extremely easy is.. not as easy as you think. Not to mention the cost, I think if evidence got out that the US gov ran a 51% attack on BTC (and it will leak), the US taxpayer would cause a shitstorm.
The cost to run that kind of attack today is insane

Something that took a while to learn is how to cite. Depending if you use MLA/APA and take out all the filler “According to.” Just write the sentence and cite or use quotes as appropriate. Dunno if they use APA/MLA or similar in EUR.
Also try not to start your essay with someone else’s essay/ don’t start with a citation. 
I also agree BTC is impossible to explain . Maybe explain one aspect of it: for example how a public ledger works and it’s use, or how SHA 256 is secure

I’m sure there’s a legal argument a competent defense attorney can make but whoever that interviewer is, saying how count 2 “reads incorrectly” should probably stop talking when he says “I’m not a lawyer but it sounds weird.” No shit it sounds weird, your not a lawyer. When you look at the plumbing in your house do you say this looks weird then call a plumber? Maybe you becoming a plumbing apprentice and fix it after 5-10 years. 
Idk, but listen to this post. Get yourself a public defender. Federal public defense is an extremely sought after job for lawyers.
Godspeed my man, you should 100% think about what kind of plea your going to be able to get because they were watching your LBC account for years and you finally popped back in they knew it might be there last shot. 10k or $5, that’s not so much the point, they were building a case for months / years I’m sure.
