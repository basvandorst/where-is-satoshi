I don't think genocide is wise or murder, but that sort of attitude is what I have come to expect from such people as yourself.

There is an online petition people are signing to ask President Trump to initiate emergency measures to allow South Africans to come to America via an expedited process.  I would sign if I were you.

That's not true, I want you in America and I think the President does also.

I'm sorry about this, but I'm about to place a $100,000 bet against the South African currency on a long term basis.  If I don't do it someone else certainly will.  Please get out of that country now before it's too late.

That's great but I would GTFO if I were you.  I mean, you can't spend bitcoin if you're dead or there's social chaos.  Please, just be safe and get out now before it's too late and you can't even sell your home for a reasonable price.

Because... that's who they are.  Their origin was as a terrorist organization which morphed into the dominant political party after apartheid ended.

Terrorism can have a morally good component to it, but the acts of terrorism are not necessarily indicative of the type of person qualified to be in charge of a government.  I fear this is a problem, but I am open to having my mind changed on it.

Typically terrorists only know one thing, how to destroy things in the name of justice or injustice.

This assumes they have the capacity to learn complex things, I'm not convinced that true.

I'm more interested in current conditions than what happened hundreds of years ago or 30.

Make your voice heard.

I am not hateful at all, you don't understand me at all, but unfortunately your own bias actually prevents you from seeing my point of view has some reasonable aspects to it.  You're literally incapable of reasonable discourse due to your excessive emotionality you attach to your own point of view, and that is truly sad.
