Yeah, but it's only relevant to a very small niche. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:11:19
Nice trolling. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:01:20
And *maybe* it's better that way, for the moment.

@_date: 2015-12-18 07:23:30
You want that, but what's the interest of banks in it?
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:08:15
Yes - and the citizens making the purchase are rather on here. Reddit is not that big in Iran, I'm fairly certain. ;)
edit: And Iran might be the wrong example now anyways, if sanctions get lifted etc. as expected.

How would Bitcoin itself become problematic for him personally, in his lifetime?!?
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:37:25
No, he's a coat.
@_date: 2015-06-09 06:09:40
Would that not expand volume, rather than shrink it, ceteris paribus?
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:06:23
Cool. Me, too.
@_date: 2015-06-27 07:15:57
Yeah, let's blame the leadership. At least that sounds like something fixable, right? ;)
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:17:43
And independent of that, good luck in not getting tracked down by the US government for violating sanctions! Not like they pursue that only half-heartedly. You will be in big trouble and, after a handful cases, anyone involved in maintaining OpenBazaar will be as well.
If you want to circumvent sanctions, some serious organizational efforts are needed, with passing through goods to a shell company in a country with lax customs, such as Dubai etc.. People that make money with that develop some fairly structures (as is usually revealed whenever someone is caught). 
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:33:35
Except that it might not be worth it, as it could have a greater negative effect on sales in other currencies.
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:36:46
And that means?!? Nothing much at all, as such, I would say. Need to know more about "how" the volume changed and why.
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:57:00
As if those people didn't do that already, three times over, by now ;)
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:52:08
Hate to break that you, but certain "thoughts" always have been forbidden - and I don't see that changing either.
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:25:48
Depends on your definition of "all over the news", I guess. 
Might get "mentioned" in a lot of places, including major outlets, but "all over the news" for me is if there's an ongoing story, with several reports, discussion etc.. And that doesn't seem all that likely to me.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:51:40
Don't remember, but that sounds interesting. Have a link?
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:22:30
How would that look like?
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:54:42
Assuming that most Greeks that live in the country still have any significant "wealth" - they don't. Years of unemployment and falling wages do that to you.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:32:56
Legitimacy that could be pulled quickly though.
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:30:10
That's not in their interest. Was already "nice" of them to not just focus on the brand that they control.
I think the benefits of people misunderstanding Bitcoin "as owned by Bitpay" outweigh the downsides. Bitpay doesn't come across as a bad company and it's a better starting point than knowing nothing (the default) or some other misconceptions, like Bitcoin = Mt. Gox, drug trade etc..
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:41:53

This sub is actually somewhat funny  and entertaining though. Unlike many subs that try to be.
@_date: 2014-12-27 16:28:37
Was interesting to see the different kind of people not excited about the game itself on Twitter. Made me realize that the kind of people "into Bitcoin" is a bit wider of a demographic than I previoisly thought: Mostly young Caucasian male, yes, but less people with technical backgrounds than I expected. (Based on Twitter bios and a fairly small convenience sample.)
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:02:14
Some people would also regard it as immoral. That depends on POV.
Illegal activities that keep on happening as a basis for a call for further regulation is pretty standard though, too.
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:31:01
No kidding.
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:57:39
Let's see...
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:48:15
All these financial instruments have a significant lobby. Bitcoin doesn't (yet).
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:46:10
Generally true, but if a belief is shared by a large majority or not does make a big difference.
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:39:13
Yeah, if people just behaved like a hive mind - not as people... ;)

Well, I got about 30 cents. That's a start. About 3 million more Bitcoin Bowls and I will have made it.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:56:47
Was wondering if I missed anything beyond that...
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:43:03
Most fiat is also an entry to a database. Also gets regulated.
@_date: 2015-05-25 09:09:05
And only uses Bitcoin as a payment method, out of principle?!? Okay...
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:35:39
So, tell me, what positive effect will this have on the price? ;)
(That's what everyone here is trying to achieve, right?)
@_date: 2015-05-02 13:59:27
Correct, that seems rather unlikely, considering where the dynamic development is at these days.
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:08:36
That's how far we have come in the "free West" now...
@_date: 2015-05-25 06:44:01
Not just America, I think. In Europe, you joke more about the government having a watch over you, but in the end people also self-censor, out of fear, or "wanting to stay out of trouble", to some extent.
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:14:38
Well, the style is very similar.
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:31:52
It is possible.

You sure do feel strongly about this.

Hehe. Good one.
@_date: 2015-05-02 14:00:15
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:52:12
Right. Just because Bitcoin doesn't have an owner, it doesn't mean it's not essentially a product or technology that needs to compete with alternatives.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:39:12
... and there we have a current usefulness-problem.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:36:57
ECB just essentially announced additional QE. Don't be surprised if the US at some point follows again.

Just because a coin is fair, it doesn't mean that it can't fail, too.
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:25:07
The real questions that you people should be concerned about are: What will be the daily transaction volume? How many active users will be around? Will local regulations still allow you to be involved?
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:03:46
Agree with that. Not interesting to talk about obvious scams here.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:43:48
Then why don't you explain it to him?
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:03:31
Keep dreaming.
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:17:17
Fun problem.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:06:26
How many more threads about this obvious scam do we need? Is it not possible to move on to some actually interesting topics?!?
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:34:09
That's an understatement. Somewhat implicitly it's very much "conspiracy", too.
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:59:23
If the price of BTC drops low enough, would miners not also start to move into altcoins?
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:42:14
Don't know much about this guy, but talking generally:
Why should a Bitcoin conference only have pro-Bitcoin speakers??? Controversial talks and discussions are part of what can make an event interesting.

Because of their experiences with other exchanges, for example.

I don't think proof is actually needed. There's plenty less-shady alternatives to put your money, it's common sense not to to put in a dodgy place.

Well, good luck with that.
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:08:48
Probably no company with a significant US-presence is the answer then, actually.

Wouldn't be surprised if someone pays them a visit soon...
@_date: 2015-05-14 06:55:19
Average tip, or median tip? Average is a pretty meaningless number in this case, as it might be heavily skewed by a few large tips.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:38:12
A scam requires a deliberate plan and quite a bit of control.
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:12:58
Usefulness means one thing: it can be used, number of transactions should go up. Usefulness is not directly correlated to demand, yet alone equal to higher sustained demand.
I don't get where you people got the idea from that usefulness would result in a higher (or lower) price.
If Bitcoin was completely useless, theoretically, the price might be zero, sure, assuming people are rational, but that's about it...
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:56:56
To me the discussions over there seem a lot more balanced, diverse and interesting. Not quite the same, probably also because it's a smaller, yet fairly active sub.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:35:38
How do you know that Bitcoin will be like TCP, not like something pre-TCP that died out after TCP came around? The network has grown quite a bit, but compared to how big it potentially could be, it is still small.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:18:45
Not peanuts in relation to the liquidity of people interested in buying Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:11:14

Assuming there's still a liquid market in 2021...
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:48:44
Or you simply realize that you need quite a bit more money to start with to live off your investments - and then need to make DIVERSIFIED investments.
Going all-in on anything means you are either gambling, or you are trying to do insider trading. In both cases, you can get your ass kicked. And deserve to.

I would argue it's pretty hard to say when the development of any technology actually "started". Usually there's a bunch of prior research you build upon.
@_date: 2016-03-29 21:12:14
Newsflash: Not every (potentially) disruptive technology makes it. Even if something is theoretically the best solution and the majority of people in the field agree on that, it doesn't always happen.
@_date: 2016-03-29 21:50:51
That's not the feeling you get from a lot of posts on this sub.

@_date: 2015-08-02 22:12:26

Inferior to Bitcoin? Possibly. They have the advantage that it's under their control to change things though, once they figure something out. For Bitcoin, some flaws are pretty widely known, yet they do not get fixed, because there is no sufficient consensus to take action.

The vast majority does, at least indirectly. There's a large share of users that either is too lazy to learn about something new, does not trust Bitcoin, or is in countries in which Coinbase (and other major Bitcoin companies) are very hard to do business with.
Most users have used Paypal at least a handful times by now while they never used Coinbase. Probably not even heard of them. First step would be that they need to create a new account, probably, while they already had one on Paypal. Therefore it does not even come close. Only for users that never used Paypal it might be similar, which is kinda pointless to discuss in the context of this article.
