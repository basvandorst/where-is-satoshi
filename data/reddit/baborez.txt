What do you mean? what is the other one?

A huge spike is coming soon huh? I surely hope so. I do get some fud sometimes.

Are you guys from here? [ it's literally mentioned every month.

What price would be so low in October that you will be really suspicious? To me this is about $5k. That will really make me think something is fucked up.

That would be quite impressive wouldn't it? I don't even care how it will touch the price, even if btc price will be extremely volatile, everywhere from 10k-20k during October, the mere touching in the 16k point is impressive.

I get that. But it's just a fun name for TA someone made with a lot of confidence, and so far, with nice success.

As far as I can see it right now, yes.
I didn't think about this deeply though, but think about this this way: Key splitting is good when you want some decision to be only possible when (n out of m) parties agree upon something.
In this scenario you actually want the user to have full control, so there's only one party that really matters.
Sorry about the half-ass explanation, haven't slept all night :) Maybe I'll think about this properly tomorrow.

Reminder: Prophecy claimed in 40-70 days price will be $16k. What do you think?

This is not a cryptography sub btw, that why you didn't get many comments.
I'm not sure I fully understand your proposition though. How does the app authenticate against the server? Using a password I guess?
If the password is kept on the device itself, then having the device equals having all the parts.
If the user only remembers the password, then why not just encrypting the seed with something like KDF(password)?

It also missing a zero so careful what you wish for
