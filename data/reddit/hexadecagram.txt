Then why are they  and with an "A" trust score?

(Edit: I was just informed by the automod bot that that site has been banned from for vote manipulation and fake accounts. Great.)
Edit edit: Your first link results in an "Access denied".
Edit edit edit: What should I be looking for in the second link?

Who's talking about an obligation? It's called good sense. You know, so that everyone can avoid situations like this one.

1. They knew ahead of time that they were not licensed to verify people in certain regions. I did not. There is **NOTHING** warning about this when you login and click "Verification" under your account..
2. All it would have taken to prevent me from giving them anything is for the very first page of the form to ask for the region in which I was located **BEFORE** asking for personal information. Nothing else, a 1-entry form asking for just the region I'm located in.
Now do you see?

Thanks for the page.

This isn't about them doing a "courtesy out of the kindness of their hearts," and it isn't just for me. Doing what I suggested would protect cex.io just as much as it would protect me or any other user. This is about good sense, not charity.
Nevertheless, thanks for your input and your suggestion and I just may take it as soon as this issue is resolved.

Both and would be options. cex.io is headquartered in the UK.
