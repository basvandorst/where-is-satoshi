Typically you encrypt your wallet with a password so that anyone who steals the file, still can not withdraw funds (as you mention). But then how do you regain access? Typically the answer is just to make a second copy (a backup) and store it in some other place. So if your entire computer was stolen, you would get a new computer and copy over your backed up wallet and you'd be back to normal.

What are the addresses where one can monitor the flow of BTC out of MtGox?

Your assumption is that tariffs are always bad for a nation's economy. I highly recommend the book [Free Trade Doesn't Work: What Should Replace It and Why]( by Ian Fletcher.

That's assuming the trades are on-chain. I don't know about this one but most trading systems are off-chain where tps is whatever their hardware can handle. Anyways, I think the answer of others that the volume is in $ and not btc is most likely.

The "financed by easy money" is referring to the Franco-Prussian War not World War II. Are you asking how the Franco-Prussian War was financed?

No. I mean, I know people with camera phones but I'd have to log into my account, enter my credit card details and take a picture of my DL on their phone and I'm not going to do that.

That's not an option. If it was, I would do it. There is no way to send an existing photo. The only way they allow is to login, enter debit card information, click a button, open the interface to the phone camera and take a photo then and there. If you don't have a camera, it can't be done (as far as I can tell).

I've run into the exact same problem. Not only that, but there's no way for me to **take a picture** of my driver's license so I simply can no longer link a debit card.
