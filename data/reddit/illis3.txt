Hmm could this be google fucking up? or are you suggesting Satoshi posted ~4 years ago about not being dorian nakamoto?
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:31:34
That's exactly what I was thinking, but much easier to understand. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:56:06
I am still confused on how this works... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:04:34
Yah because right when I have a car payment I invest 10,000 in an extremely volatile market...

Even bigger picture, 1883-1999.

Good point, it had been used as a currency for thousands of years.
But wouldnt the entry into the market be a similar? 
Exchange rates wouldn't have been set, volatility happens as it starts to gain value, mixed with the rising inflation of USD... 
I think im running myself up a tree here.

He will never escape said jar.

I agree with this, I just thought the comparison was interesting since that seems to be what people are doing to justify these movements either way.

It's funny how most other people see this giant "crash" and not the kinks of the birth of a new currency. 
The people who are out only to make money are the ones nay-saying and gloating that they didnt get in. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:21:12
Excuse me not start trading just gaining value in the markets.
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:40:09
The logic made sense 6 months ago, I dont know how but it did. 
Kinda the reason I am asking strategies, It doesn't make sense anymore haha

If its for goods it can be disputed and the money will be returned... My reputation on both reddit and paypal would be on the line. 
But if this is the overall feeling it's understandable.
Someone on here was just trying to scam me out of money by doing the "gift" option and deleted their account. Good thing I didnt do it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:00:05
Man, you have got quite a wait ahead of you.
If this isnt a joke we just witness a pretty large crash over the past day and a half.
$500 coin will be another 8 month wait at the least based on past relative crashes.

Bitinstant but it seems to not be working for bitstamp

Im in on bitcoin, all for it, just interested to let it ride and see what happens; but those graphs would be the wrong ones used to show to scale. 
That Mt. Gox graph is daily while the other one is weekly. 
The scale of the bitcoin crash has been much more dramatic.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:25:38
I dont know anything. I really don't like I said in the title. Im just here for the ride and experience.
