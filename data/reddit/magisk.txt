Well I've made some profits, luckily didnt keep all on Gox. But I have to admit, this hurts and Idk how this will effect my life :/
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:33:11
Eric is correct here, there is no doubt about that really. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:48:05
right for the wrong reasons though
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:49:17
10% according to the market
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:37:02
Well I could be wrong ofcourse, its just seems so amateurish to me. But then again, so has Mt.Gox so it wouldnt really suprise me.
With that said though, It contains some ridiculous sentences and spelling mistakes. such as:
 "The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to"
This was written literately above a sentence which claims Gox is sort of 750k coins.. Which then begs the question, why does the sentence contain the word "can".
And there are several more examples like this. It just cant be real.
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:44:44
I wrote what you implied. Am I wrong? This whole argument started out by me saying that this may hurt a gox customer. You firmly said no. :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:08:22
There are several people who have lots of unreleased info and they are not assholes or need the bigger e-penis
Ryan Selkis has no way to know who Mark is talking to. He can guess though, but then thats like saying "none of my friends who most of are involved with direct competitors of Gox wants to help" well what a surprise... Hardly news at best and certainly does not warrant the headline "there are no investors"
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:26:43
It really cant be a legit document, its so badly written and not from a perspective it should have been. Some parts of the doc its written as "we" and some other parts its "Gox" and some other parts its "they"
Not to mention how terrible its layed out, how amateurish the plan is, how little details there are. Not to mention the doc claims they are 750k bitcoins short... Which is obv nothing a rebranding will fix.
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:34:40
Couple of good points here and I think whatever the reason is for the large sales, its very strange considering this:
Its arguably better to hold Bitcoin than fiat on gox, reason is that if gox does not fail, cashing out coins is easy but fiat will still be hard.
If gox does fail, you are fucked either way.
So I think the sales could be explained with 2 scenarios
1. As you said, Gox could be manipulating the value with sales (seems plausible, given that they chose to allow trading while halting cashouts and deposits, which is a strange move)
2. Someone or a group have shorted Bitcoins somewhere or made huge bets that the rate will go down/be below x, and are as a result manipulating the price by selling a large holding
Btw, personally I think its more likely that gox will survive, for several reasons. One being the insane amount of profit they must have made over the years. For long they where the only exchange and just the last week they made $1.9 mill in trading fees.
But, as we know there is an investigation which gox are not allowed to speak off, this could mean that perhaps more funds than reported are frozen, which causes a problem for gox. But in that case, should gox fail users will be paid regardless.
Edit: there is also another alternative which some people are floating around, and that is that gox have lost a lot of coins due to a hack or similar, which have snowballed into this situation.
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:53:55
Yeah I don't understand why anyone would sell bitcoins for that low rate, it makes zero sense. For example in a scenario where gox does not fail, both usd and euro cashouts will still take forever, however bitoins are fast and in a scenario where gox does fail, it doesn't really matter what you hold. Bitcoins or fiat you are still fucked.
= Best buying opportunity ever for those who have fiat stuck on gox. If it fails you are fucked either way, if it doesn't fail you suddenly have 2x whatever you bought
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:20:52
True, could be
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:24:29
LOL the irony, its to much.
I'm not the one trying to prove a negative here. Its kinda obvious. Your previous post however is almost the definition of it
Edit. Not to mention that you are defending someone who is making a career on it :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:37:15
You missed my point completely.
There is no upside in leaking sensitive info right now, all it does it make a potential deal less likely. 
Real journalists and insiders know this, obv. And cred to them, disregarding personal gratification in the hope that things may work out, even though slim chances
This guy doesn't care though, he has made his trade and should for some reason people get repaid he will be disappointed
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:24:43
There could have been. Respected people within the industry has already said that there were takeover talks that may now have been stopped because of this leak
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:31:24
Uhm that's interesting. This could be a legit doc, if so though Gox being insolvent is not really the story of the day. The fact hat someone (probably a few individuals) has stolen 5%+ of all Bitcoins is :(
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:07:17
If this is true, call your bank asap (these international wires are most often processed manually, depending on where you live and what bank you use)
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:05:42
Hey there,
Lots of people with similar story, I think similar thoughts all the time even down to estimating how much I lost out because I waited a while before buying mine, looking back it now though it all seems irrelevant and I'm thankful I didn't lose everything. I think today there are a lot of people who have gotten their lives literary destroyed with first the high of "getting rich" for then today finally having their dreams shattered. That feeling is way worse than missing an early chance on a high risk investment, so my heart goes out to everyone who feels that pain today. Thousands of people :(
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:41:55
What does having a more realistic view of the situation actually accomplish? Nothing
Compared to the other side of the argument where a acquisition is at least plausible
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:21:51
Omg jesus, I'm starting to believe that reddit is completely full of retards.
Obv a deal that makes everyone hole is very unlikely, probably wont happen. But as you said yourself maybe, given the circumstances people could get 10-20% back. Which would be awesome and literally save lifes.
Dont you agree that Ryan Selkis e-penis enlargement initiative harms that process?
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:25:58
That post was one of the most absurd ones I've seen, some guy claiming he has an "inside report" and all he mentions is a 750k loss.. come on..
This one on the other hand is just pure speculation, which is fine and should be encouraged. I feel like I bring up a fair point though, feel free to make a counter argument :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:48:33
I will post this here as well:

For once in his life this retard is slightly relevant and he is not going to let that moment pass, ohh no. He will "protect the gox users" as the nice person he is..
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:56:10
Of course. Of course they would have found out, but public perception matters a lot. Maybe the investors didn't want this information to get publicized at this time, could be... That's my point.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:56:27
The pdf is obv fake regardless. Its almost funny how bad and weird it is
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:44:11
Damn, that's interesting. The crisis report than loses more creditability and after this its arguably less likely that 750k coins was actually stolen :)

@_date: 2014-02-25 23:58:10
What? Dude you have some serious personal problems. Get help.
All I'm saying is that leaking that doc didn't accomplish anything, but could very well have spoiled a takeover. which is a fact.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:06:02
Thanks for the encouraging words :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:42:32
How can you know that? What about the basically confirmed info that Gox has 200k coins left..
Take this as a lesson, improve the way you think ;)
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:08:27
Much thanks
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:30:41
The balls on that guy if Gox actually fails. People need to worry about their lives, not unpleasant letters.
Not to mention the egoism, feeling sorry for himself and staff, while potentially destroying thousands of lives.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:44:59
hehe good point
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:43:29
Ofcourse the truth matter, the point however is that it wouldn't harm anyone if the sensitive info was held back a couple days.
especially not considering that there is no way to deposit. So leaking info accomplishes nothing while it may damage peoples chances of getting repaid fully or partially. Do you really disagree?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:31:37
Yup that seems plausible
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:41:57
LOL yeah... This sounds believable.. 100mill..
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:54:00
Well that's a fair point. However in my experience these high pressure takeover talks are super strict and fragile. Anything can derail a process, bad publicity is certainly one of the main concerns.
Had for example the shortfall of coins been released after a deal was struck then the media coverage would have been completely different. Perhaps "x saves gox and repays all funds to users, with more details on how gox failed" while now all the top hits on google and talk is about mtgox+hack+fraud etc.
So it could very well matter, although everyone is probably fucked regardless. My point though, is just that these early leaks are unnecessary and more harmful than good.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:11:23
True, doesn't change the fact that this "journalist" took advantage for personal gain though, while trying to make excuses for why it was not insider trading.
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:54:33
wow really, that was fast.
I've made a support ticket, hopefully they help me out that fast.
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:33:07
Wow you are actually retarded, like. I'm speechless.
Your point is that one comment of one investors proves that the leaked document could not under any circumstance have hurt Gox costumers?...... :) 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:43:40
Given that bitstamp is at 521 I think its sortof proven that the 750k heist story is fake.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:16:07
Edit: A lot :(
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:04:39
It was a terrible and egocentric decision made based on the desire to ensure that Gox fails. Has nothing to do with "bringing the truth" or what OP claimed.
By releasing it he may have harmed Bitcoin gravely, not only that. OP admitted that he sold his full stake in Bitcoin prior to publishing. (For then to say he will not buy before 30days, as if that for some helps)
Mt.Gox could have been close to being bought, this leak could have spoiled it. I'm not surprised though, this guy as with a lot of other wannabess suddenly find themselves in a situation with some power, but without that many braincells.
Ofcourse Mt.Gox is to blame here, but releasing this document, if its legit or not, makes it worse, while it accomplishes nothing. Why not wait a day or two? What would the harm be?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:29:14
A little, sold some early on. But this is an unreal amount of cash to lose like this really

@_date: 2014-02-27 02:58:58
That makes zero sense. If someone outside is considering moving in, then that would be under NDA and completely unknown to everyone, obv.
= Ryan Selkis is completely full of shit and an admitted insider trader
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:44:32
And the plot thickens.
I guess we are left with two alternatives now.
1. Mtgox gets bought up
2. Mtgox fails
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:58:30
We don't know how much funds they are actually missing. It may not be that much, even with a small amount its a problem when a "bank run" happens. In either case, I think it cant be a very large amount, given the huge profit they have made, unless there has been a huge hack that was covered up or Karpeles gambled away the funds somehow.
He would fear for his life, as would anyone else in the same situation. One thing is for sure, he has all the motivation in the world to make this end well. The whole world is watching him, literately.
The incentive would be to get a huge percentage of gox  future profit, which could be substantial if consumer confidence returns. Gox is the most well known name in Bitcoin. Not to mention anyone who comes in and saves the ship is automatically a hero. (If a large company wanted to establish themslves in the center of Bitcoin, this is a perfect opportunity!!)
Karpeles would with a deal like this get replaced as CEO, and have smaller function at Gox before he eventually fades away, which would be something he would want if the other alternative is Gox failing.
I've seen this happen several times before btw, even recently with fulltiltpoker, where they was 300mill usd short or something, Pokerstars bought them, secured their position in the market and the site is now doing well.
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:29:09
Thanks for your valuable contribution.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:03:16
That is not a fact. There are dozens of ways costumers can be repaid, at least partially.
To say that "all funds are lost for sure" is ridiculous, but its ironically the only statement you can make that backs up your flawed argument.
Of course leaking sensitive documents at this time that may not even be legit might hurt gox costumers. Why are you not seeing that.. :)
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:07:54

ohh my, the failz
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:24:57
No one can be trusted. Period.
Gox doesnt have all the funds, thats pretty clear by now. However that does not mean that it will fail, just that there is risk for it.
I think there is a decent change everything will resolve itself, there is a lot of value in the name and a lot of wealthy individuals who have a huge incentive for it to survive.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:47:25
Ohh my jesus, please don't reproduce
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:08:31
There is no way this is real! Its not even correctly written, mixed third/first person etc, not at all how a internal crises report would have been handled.
And not to mention that if 750k coins was stolen, what would be the point of this report..
Ridiculous weak attempt at market manipulation
Edit: Lots of people insist this is real. Maybe it is, I still find it hard to believe thogh
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:29:03
This guy is such a retard. Even admitting to selling coins before leaking sensitive docs, as that somehow makes it okay..
"Hey I have insider information and I'm going to sell, but because I tell everyone after the fact its not insider trading?.."
 Guy obv will do whatever he can to make things worse. Doesn't care about spoiling a potential deals, all to just get a "scoop" and trump his own horn. "Hey everyone finally for once in my life I have an opportunity to be relevant and spew things out on the internet for mine and my friends personal gain, as the puppy I am"
Like holding back info like everyone else is doing a few more days would do any damage.. Its sad to see the rats and scum only think about themselves, this guy is the worst of em all.

The title of the thread we are discussing in is named "TwoBitIdiot Says Gox has no buyers and never did" LOL....
Unless you can somehow convince everyone that Ryan Selkis knows for certain everyone Mark is/has talked to during this whole ordeal I don't see how that statement can be backed up. Please enlighten me
and just to point out the obvious, you said "It's not a lack of evidence; it's evidence of a lack of investors "
Which sounds like you mean that the fact that this one person doesn't know about any investors, means that there isn't one. Which is obv ridiculous.

That was it? What a fucking let down by OP. No real info just speculations and rumors.. (From a self admitting insider-trader with ties to JP Morgan)


Interestingly this text does not say anything about those parties stands on a possible takeover. It only refers to "improper ties", although this could be a typing mistake by OP (very likely as he has shown signs of being full retard/the clown of bitcoin news.. so wouldn't be surprising if he got the most important part of the post wrong)
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:31:33
I don't think anyone has a reason for that now.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:19:18
Did he say that he ONLY reached out to his competitors/community members?
Obv not, and anyone with half a brain can see that if there is a takeover it can only happen by a group that comes from the outside. Perhaps someone who believe in Bitcoin, want to place themselves in the middle of the ecosystem, while saving thousands of people from financial ruin.
hoe can you or Ryan Selkis know if this absolutely can not happen?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:52:04
Mark, Ross is protected by metal bars
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:29:58
I don't think you will find any reporter that goes on record saying "no one of my friends, who happen to be direct competitors wants to bail Gox out, so therefor there are no investors"
I hope you see how ridicules that statement is. 
And how am I at fault for pointing that out.. ?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:30:22
Yup. I hope he doesn't say a blip more tho, I have some much rolling on gox getting bought out
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:04:03
Very good point.
Not to mention that if they are actually having liquidity problems, any attempt to resolve that would mean even more NDA's and complexity.
