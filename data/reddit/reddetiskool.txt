Is there any updated news of potential release dates? We've read quite a lot of good news lately, is it moving towards a Q1-Q2 release?
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:13:22
Low quality shitpost
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:14:21
Your statement is so fundamentally wrong, that it actually hurts my brain just reading and trying to process what kind of reasoning of yours could lead you to initiate a thought that would lead to such a stupid reply.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:41:06
I think it's quite nice name actually
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:23:27
I don't know.

Could someone explains this to me. What's the difference from getting your salary in fiat and then just purchasing Bitcoins? Wouldn't that be alot safer since the currency is so volotile?
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:10:43
Well obviously. But buying into any kind of asset is a risk, and I agree with the OP, after such great correction, it should be said that we are still better of, that just a mere month ago. It's quite easy to get into the doomsday mind of thinking and believing it's the end of all things and I do not blame them. I've been there myself - many times.
However, I do think it's important to point out for newcomers - such as myself really - that you must believe in the long-term success of any asset you're investing in. The problem with Bitcoin is that for many people, this may be their first investment in an asset, making it very stressful for them, since it's such volatile asset.

This would either be insane - or an anti-climax out of this world
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:58:42
Just remember to look the other way and keep on HODL. There's so much movement and interest right now and it's just the start. Set a date - one month from now - until then, keep on hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:33:15
Yeah, I'm starting to suspect that too. This will absolutely crash - the buy orders has decreased from 1300 to 350 the last hour. This is insane.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:27:41
I would deem you mentally retarded if that was the case, not praising your prediction.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:42
How many unread PMs did you have? I assume a lot of people just randomly messaged you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:28:54


Hmm... so that's a real thing people are doing daily - like putting in a system?
That would explain sell walls I'm seeing in the euro market, if people are setting them up to buy cheap coins all along the $ is valuing the coins more.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:04:33
You mean Coinbase - not Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:48:10
I just hope my sell order went through... Quite nervous it did not and the price just plunges because Coinbase are fucktards
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:57:36
What does determine the price?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:44
I think it's important to have somewhat neutral view on this. Just because you really wish it - does not mean it will happen. I do however think it's possible.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:53
Where do you get those figures from?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:51:27
The legendary scammer? What are you talking about. Fair enough that you support BCH, but following Jordan Belfort is quite... dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:24:58
First time I'm actually sitting in a chair watching the GDAX Depth Chart on the living room TV. I'm slowly turning into an Bitcoin-addict.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:19:25
Yeah, but I cannot go on GDAX and simply say I want to pay 16000$ for 1 BTC, no? I can only buy at the price it's currently at, no?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:45:13
Oh damn. I had to read the comments to figure out that it was two different time periods. I thought you for some reason included two charts of the same period with different settings or something.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:21:23
the dogening
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:50:18
Wouldnt that open quite a lot of business opportunities? For example, if someone creates the BitcoinChanneler Inc company. This company then has a lot of open channels towards different vendors? Or am I missing how this actually works? :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:55:29
Yeah - that shit is real. But I guess it's good learning, although it was a damn expensive lesson to learn...
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:31:16
I'll trade it with you for some dogecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:45:15
Well, prove it!
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:20:36
Well, funny enough, I do believe it's just good. We do not need people whom do not realize this themselves to invest in Bitcoin right now. We need people whom understands it better that we'll help stabilize it. So if you ask me - Thank you media!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:45:01
I got weak hands and actually sold... Panicked!! So disappointed in myself... Almost lost 20% of my Bitcoins holding buying it back now... :(
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:06:54
My understanding would be that you create one channel and this channel can be kept open until you close it. Meaning you can top-op how many times you want, until closure... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:01
This is insane. There's almost no purchase orders for BCH. I'm to in-experiance for this, I got not idea what will or could happen here. The price will just plumped?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:52:18
Haha! I thought this was quite funny actually!
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:57:25
Really exciting for this! Could seriously take Bitcoin to something completely else! Could even have a third-party, like the BitcoinChannelers that would take payments from the user in BTC but pay the vendor in whatever they want to be paid in. Super exciting!
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:08:50
Euro market seems a bit bullish - or at least less violent - but I think it's going to be going up and down for quite a long time more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:46:42
Hmm - I'll make sure to check that out as soon as the whole circus has calmed down a bit and the prize stabilizes again (hopefully)
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:44:46
Me too! Coinbase seem to be done for me right now, I'm just waiting to buy more! However this Bitcoin journey ends up, this is hell of a fun interest!
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:16:55
I'm just saying, judging by your own post history, you sound pretty "euphoric" yourself - just a mere month ago.
"...Attack!!!! Show them BTC only moves in one direction.....moonward!!!..."
"...and they can never get ahead by buying stocks like everybody else. This is like having a time machine and being able to go back and buy apple, or amazon, or google stocks before they were big..."
"...That’s like people who didn’t buy Apple in the 70s. You just look at the current and future options, can’t worry about past..."
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:32:23
Seems like there's people setting up quite large sell walls (for being in the euro market) keeping the price down.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:33:39
It is. It's quite obvious if you look at the markets. But that does not mean we're going to be in for another 2-3 days of this, I believe it's having a bull run as soon as the price hits a bargain again for the big money.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:04:00
I always wonder what drives people like you to even come here and comment. I get that you may not believe in a bull-run for Bitcoin, but why the dramatic tone? Phrases such as "euphoria is over", "fear is set in and panic has begun amongst the wise"... What the hell are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:36:30
I'll adopt it as soon as the open up for europe!
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:43:19
Oh, Bitstamp allow you to play in both markets? Coinbase does not allow me to buy in the $ markets, since I'm european.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:20
Yeah, Coinbase is full of bullshit!
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:02:52
They started now. It will be flat for hours until all the purchase orders are done then I think it will plumbed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:18:01
The bubble is going to burst when the sellers heavily out-weight the buyers. Then you may ask, when will that happens and the answer to that question is: Nobody knows. You could however speculate that by this and that time, or because of the heavy load of newbies coming into the game that any minor down-turn would trigger a domino game of sellers. 
However, I do not believe it will occur anytime in the near future. There's quite a lot of movements going on right now in the Bitcoin community and it's gaining a lot of mainstream attention. This attention will continue for a long time. 
I believe the value of Bitcoin is going to heavily increase throughout december and into januar. But that's just my guess taken right out of the air.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:47:07
It's had a small rise again the last couple of hours. I think the trend is turning already to be honest. It may dip a bit yet again, but the trend from now on is up-going. In a couple of hours east-coast US is going to wake up to a positive trend, and is going to buy again.

This mofo is the found of the swedish "Pirate Party". They gained some traction 5-10 years ago when the whole The Pirate Bay trail was going on in Sweden. Stealing seems to be in his genes.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:09:52
1000btc buy wall?
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:12:21
Your chart? That does not say anything? Based on my guess, I would say 9000 within the start of next week and 10.000 within first half of Jan 2018.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:02:04
People are totally missing who are complaining... It's people that bought in at 15-20K. Not the people who bought at 2K...
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:16:43
Thanks for the reply. Could I have two different laptops, having the same wallet? What happens if I recover my wallet on another computer, while the other one is still running? Meaning, could I like double up, so my paranoid ass won't go berserk.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:44:38
But as my understanding, the fork has already happen privetly?Though they plan to go public on 25th Oct.
"The fork has already privately occurred at a point known only to the Bitcoin Gold development team. The Bitcoin Gold blockchain will be made publicly available when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches block number 491,407, which is currently estimated to occur on October 25, 2017."
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:25:13
What do you mean increased risk of getting funds stolen? Do you mean in the sense that there is a doubled risk, since there are now two devices someone could steal?
Thanks, the analogy got me to understand the meaning of a wallet and the keys. Where are the coins stored? In the 'network'?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:40:13
Could I ask a maybe stupid question. 
Lets say for simplicity I buy 1 BitCoin. This is then worth 5000 USD. The next day it goes 50%, meaning my BitCoin is now worth 250 USD. But if the value goes up to 5000 USD per BitCoin again, have I really lost anything? 
I mean, if I really believe the value will rise in the future, does it matter if something goes down or crashes, more than it right now, for the moment is not worth what it was yesterday?  
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:30:41
Oh ok, so I should rather have two devices, with two different wallets instead. Thanks for all the answers, this is quite amazing! I am completely sold on Bitcoin and its future, so this is very exciting!
