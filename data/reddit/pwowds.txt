Hey!! Can I have some bits?
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:09:26
I can't wait until they accept it.
@_date: 2014-10-19 12:21:45
So....Just hand your private keys over to who ever works there?
That will end well.

All of the tips I have received I have withdrawn and spent for real goods. That falls into the "Real Money" category for me.
If you mean to say that Bitcoin isn't "Real Money", why are you on @_date: 2014-09-29 00:08:32

That would be wonderful, and I think python would be a good choice language wise because a lot of less experienced (and experienced) people learned/are learning it as their first language.
I think guides on a block explorer would be pretty awesome.

Don't judge. I find that I do my best thinking while on the john.

Yeah...until some one from GOX starts answering calls...
Caller: "How can I invest?"
Gox Guy/gal: "Wait in a que to be approved, then wire your money to me."
Caller: "Yay! Now I too can own [blowstamps!](
***several months pass***
Gox Guy/gal: "Your money is lost."
Caller: "OH NO!!!...Wait, there is proof you still have it!?!?!?"
Gox Guy/gal: "And?"

Look into amateur cycling teams. 
They are always receptive to sponsorship offers.
@_date: 2014-10-21 10:19:28
Yes, simply because the technology behind it is so incredibly transformative.
@_date: 2014-06-29 11:34:19
Who doesn't want free bits?
@_date: 2014-06-21 11:31:21
Yes, as long as your router does as well.

Well, if [this]( page is to be believed, 500 pages of plain text = 1 megabyte (assuming 2000 characters/page).
If we say that the blockchain is 20GB, that gives us 20,000MB.
20,000MB * 500pages/MB == 10,000,000 pages.
That is quite large. If you split it into 1000 page volumes, you get 10,000 volumes.
Using [this]( calculator, I get a weight of ~.911kg per volume (assuming letter size paper)
10,000 volumes * .911kg/volume = 9110 kg.
I don't even want to think about shipping.
Assuming it was shipped via usps library mail, at a rate of [$2.56]( per one pound, you are looking at ~$51307.52.
That doesn't include the cost of the dump-truck rental to get all of that from the post office.

The question is: Is this guy more or less of a crook than Karples?

An upvote for trying.

If he expresses interest, set up a wallet for him, and send a small amount to it.

If you deposited at Bank of America, they don't send it until the morning of the next business day.
That was on their website, but it would be nice if they made it more obvious. It was easy to miss.

Well, property isn't legal tender but can be used as a medium of exchange.
