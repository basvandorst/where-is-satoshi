While this is an interesting and unexpected introduction from Gemini, it's disheartening in a number of ways to see the responses. 
I've seen people say that GUSD will be the medium of exchange on Ethereum instead of Ether. This shows two things:
A) The instability and transient nature of Ether's monetary policy is causing people to cash out of ETH incredibly fast. ETH is not a currency, it's a utility token. 
B) Even to this day people do not understand ideas of store of value and the properties that make a good currency.
Personally I just hope someone figures out how to move Bitcoin onto Ethereum in a decentralized way as a token, or that 0xBitcoin picks up in adoption. Either way, there needs to be the option of using a REAL cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain.

That currency's name? Albert Einstein.

I use an android and found that the blockchain app is kind of shitty. Plus the servers or something seem unstable every now and then if that's possible. What do you recommend/use? 
And yea that makes sense. I was confused because with all this talk of qt and XT and bitcoin 2.0 I wasn't sure how they were all related. But it seems that's it's just upgrades on the existing blockchain which makes sense to me now. Thanks a bunch!

This is really awkward and maybe this is the wrong place for a newbie on these matters... But is there like an eli5 for what all this bitcoin XT and bitcoinQ (I think) is? Is bitcoin not going to be around as we know it? Is this an update or a different currency? 
Again sorry if this is the wrong place for this, just trying to understand.

So even though many consider bitcoin XT an "altcoin" is will take the place of Bitcoin in many applications? Coinbase and Circle and similar websites will function as usual? My blockchain app will still hold bitcoin XT like before? We'll call the post-fork bitcoin XT just "Bitcoin"?

Are you ever afraid you're getting cheated by the site on the backend of playing against bots?

I would have assumed it has been happening for years... With the amount of money to be made, especially with the number of legal states for gambling, I'm almost sure AI bots are reeling in tons of money. 
I mean even just a stats overlay gives you a huge edge. You input the parameters of the hand (# of players, type of poker, your hand, flop cards, etc) and it gives you the precise statistics of how likely certain cards are to pop up. You can then have a bot give you suggestions based on this info. Even the most advanced anti-bot software can't do anything about this since you can just have the overlay on a laptop next to you. 
I like poker a lot and was always considering getting into it, but knowing that this MUST be widespread is why I never bothered.

Invesdor unfortunately requires that all US based investors be "accredited investors", which means over $1M net worth or an income of over $200,000 a year. Unless you suggest people lie about their status, &gt;90% of redditors cannot actually invest in your company.

That makes sense, it's a shame though! I'm sure many of us would want to put in $500 and see where it goes :)
