Well, long term of course not. I used the wrong word there. Shouldn't have said "kill", but short term it seems to be a problem.
If the value is lower and lower why would people buy go through the trouble to buy Bitcoins if you can't even wait a few weeks before you buy something? We get less new users and less people interested. Yes, in the far future it wouldn't matter. The price evens out and the infrastructure is there, so then it could really be widely adopted.
But before that?
*(I have no clue, though. Just guessing. ELI5)*

So, the more merchants accept Bitcoin via payment processors like Coinbase and Bitpay the faster Bitcoins drops.
Correct me if I'm wrong here, but doesn't that essentially mean a wide adoption via payment processors could ~~kill~~ would be really problematic for Bitcoin? Who wants to buy Bitcoin if it just continues to become less valuable? 
Now Bitpay just announced their oh so awesome "free" plan, and Coinbase might work with Wikipedia and partnered with Dell, aren't we in trouble? 
*Edit: No killing, obviously. Bad wording.*

Very cute service. Thanks. That should do the trick.

... and pay taxes and vat, because you are importing goods to wherever you live? 
Who does that?

No, and I don't understand what you are hinting at?

Oh. Have to admit that I didn't even try because of the big red notification.
