That's what I already do, Without buying BTC. and remove beans, I mostly eat noodles because it's the cheapest food I can find, Noodles and quick pasta (cheap aswell). 
Wish I would have a job where I could atleast drop like $100 a month to BTC

I wish I had money

I have invested a total of $40 in BTC when it was at $17,000 because I don't have a lot more money to invest. So I got some BTC but not a lot :)

So what if an hacker got access to the alot of computers to the "network", '
So if you "mine" bitcoins, you get an transaction of the coin? 
so on a magical way, this prevent an hacker to get access to bitcoins that never been mined on some way?

So you could say that people belives that this is the currency we use in the future

Hi this is for an school project!
So when you get an bitcoin, or 0.00001 or what you mine, it has to be confirmed by other users? "confirmed" by the network from other people?

It is almost too late for me.
Sure, I could drop like $100 at most a month and hope that "Maybe in 5 years this $100 will be worth $2000!"
The cost of me dropping this $100 a month equals to me only being able to Work -&gt; Eat cheap -&gt; sleep -&gt; repeat.
I got no money to actually start with BTC.
I have a wallet with $4.6 in it :)

Not really intressed, working on an school project and this idea popped in my head after 10 pages of writing that what stops an hacker to get funds that does not exist
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:41:21
1 more question about the "network"
Is each little mine transaction confirmed by every single people mining?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:49:07
It goes up and down, but each time it goes down it goes up. 
Why even bother asking if it was a bubble

Could anyone fill me in, Why would anyone buy a house for 40 BTC instead of just selling them for like 10% profit of the cost? (Then the house would cost like 35 BTC instead as example)
