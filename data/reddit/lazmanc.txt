I have an undergraduate degree in Finance from a top business school, so I understand long-term investing.
I'm not American so I don't know what a 529 fund is but assuming its like other education funds, your money is likely invested in the very much inflated stock market (much of which consists of bank/financial stocks; all of which are likely to lose most of their capitalization), government bonds and t-bills, and other shitty assets all of which are exposed to artificial government inflation and a failing monetary policy.
This why is people are shitting their pants over their retirement fund. Crypto is the future, and will remain the top performing asset class for some time moving forward.
You're obviously the one who doesn't understand investing since if you had any clue what diversification means you'd have left at least some exposure to the crypto market. If you don't have crypto, you are not diversified. 
I'm not shitting on you, nor do I think you're stupid. I just think your decision to sell out in this extremely bullish market was not properly thought out.

Cryptocurrency, now having surpassed 0.5 trillion USD in market cap is far more than a fairly tale.
I don't think government is inherently immoral or evil, but like any organization, they have an incentive to grow in size, scope and power. The means by which this accomplished is progressive taxation further aided by artificially generated inflation. I don't think any one individual in the government is necessarily evil, but the sum result leads to a system of coercion.
The fact that government and banks are old says nothing about their morality. Monarchies are also old; should we be continuously ruled by one family with power succeeding based solely on genetic inheritance? 
The nature of progress is the decentralization of power. Sure the world envisioned by us Bitcoiners is still a dream, but you can be sure I'll help make it a reality.

I think describing market cap (in this context at least) as: **number of coins *in circulation* x price per coin** makes it ever so slightly clearer to people with non-finance backgrounds.
Also, I think its great that a side effect of crypto is that a lot more people are learning about finance, investing, trading, economics, etc... 
Hell, I have a finance degree and I've learned more via cryptocurrency then I did in university.

Why does everyone assume that free market forces won't force people to place their money with trusted firms? Brand reputation is everything when it comes financial services, and it should be the responsibility of everyone to do their own due diligence before handing over their money to a company. 
Like all businesses, exchanges have an economic incentive not to scam their clients since it would only take a few hours for people to stop using them following some sort of scam. 
Its the same argument when it comes to food/supplement regulation by the FDA. I don't need the FDA to tell me Coca-Cola is safe to drink. They have an over 100 year track record of providing safe products, and they have every incentive to make sure they don't poison their customers. Following along with the example of food products; if you are a new company with no "brand-recognition", there are endless private labs/safety companies who can provide inspection/testing/certification services to new companies so as to provide consumer peace-of-mind. These firms have the exact same economic incentive to provide thorough and trust-worthy analysis of the companies they certify. 
Why should it be the responsibility of say, me, as a taxpayer, to contribute my earned money towards centralized regulatory agencies to protect people who consistently make bad decisions? If you're an old person who can easily be scammed over the phone or something, or some young teenager who doesn't know what he's doing; when does that become my responsibility as an individual to protect you?
I don't need the government to protect me from being scammed; I can do my own research and take responsibility for my own choices. Its entirely coercive and immoral in nature to force people to participate in a regulated economy.

Haha I actually made another post about a month ago about how the government will need to switch to sales and property tax for revenue. Indeed, thats also a possibility.
This would probably require the government to track store inventory though, since they would have no way of tracking actual sales if untraceable cryptos like Monero are used. . I'm not sure how else they could know how much you sell. This doesn't solve sales tax for services rendered though. Still requires businesses to voluntarily disclose their sales revenue.

Hey, me again. I was stalking your posts.
What I've seen to be the case currently, is that people entering the crypto space have irrationally come to the conclusion that newer and "cheaper" coins (coins with lower prices) are somehow better vehicules for speculation. Most people have no understanding of monetary policy. 
I was speaking to someone today about investing crypto who said he's putting all his money into ethereum because the price is lower and its newer. He didn't even know ETH has like 5 times the unit supply of coins; which in theory, would produce a price value 5 times lower than Bitcoin given a swap in market caps (The Flippening I guess?). 
I think a lot of people are going to dump money into alts like ETH and Ripple because they incorrectly assume they missed the boat for bitcoin. People are irrationally seeking to replicate the 50,000% returns which early Bitcoin adopters (I don't like to say investors) enjoyed. A rational investor would realize that a sure 500% more return on Bitcoin, which is likely, is still a great investment.
Anyway, tl;dr, people are retards, so we still stand to profit from their irrationality by at least temporary hodling some alts. 
Does this make sense?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:10:47
OP hasn't said anything that has already been said 100 quadrillion times here and on (home of the fiat-cucks). Its redundant.
The fact that governments will want to control it says nothing about their ability to do so. 
You might be able to argue that governments could theoretically stop business owners from accepting it as currency, but given that its being used as store of value, not a currency, means that its price will continue to increase. 
The idea here is that we are taking the power away from governments. Yes they will fight us, but they will lose. 
Soon we will see people running for office who will base their entire platform on legalizing bitcoin and deregulating the financial industry. I have as much faith in such person being elected as I do in Bitcoin. 
If you're at all interested in being diversified in your holdings, I highly recommend you buy at least *some* bitcoin, if only to hedge against your bets.

You're absolutely right, and I perhaps misspoke. 
What I'm saying is that there are shared resources which have to be paid for one way or the other. Perhaps low taxation rates provide the most *efficient* means of accomplishing that, perhaps not - I don't know. 
One could quite easily argue that businesses have more to gain through the use of roads, so they would pay for it. The cost would be incorporated into the cost of goods.

Whats not to like... bacon, maple syrup, weed, hockey, excessive politeness ;)
We have winter though which sucks. I think I'd take winter over California traffic though!

Actually its deflationary nature means its value could grow ad infinitum provided that the economy continues to grow.

How is taxing income better when technologies like Monero make it super easy to hide your income?
Property tax is arguably the easiest way to tax people. You can't really hide your house...

Haha is down just a Canadian thing or something? I just assumed everyone uses it.

I don't think it will ever end. Money corrupts us unlike anything else on earth. What happens in these next few years may very well create the most powerful people on this planet. Everyone is vying for those spots.
I think more than anything, the people who truly care about seeing Bitcoin succeed as more than a means of getting rich are precisely those of us who aren't pulling the strings.

Well lets be reasonable here, we need taxes for like roads and sewers and shit. I'm definitely a libertarian though. I don't see a reason for more than like 15% tax rate.

Well you guys are basically Canadian...

Downvoting for irrational FUD. You're the delusional one. You're like the people who were talking shit about planes during the rise of commercial aviation. Planes are simply better than trains, there's no argument.
Investing in Bitcoin is not gambling. It has intrinsic value derived from it's underlying technology. It is the first digital currency to have solved the double spending problem; this is a huge step forward in both computer science and economics. 
In fact, I believe its highly under-speculated given the possibility it has to completely revolutionize the way humans and computers exchange value with each other. 
We are about to witness astounding changes to our political, technological and economic systems; to the benefit of people everywhere (except the banks and politicians).
The circumstances of this paradigm shift are both profound and exciting. 
This is not speculation.

No. In fact, he has a perfect grasp of the point; rooted in his basic understanding of economics, which you seem to lack. 
Its simple supply and demand mechanics. There is a demand for Bitcoin (irrelevant whether you think people are right or wrong to want it), and thus, its scarcity produces a price directly proportional to its supply limit.
OPs point was to say thats people speculating on its price are delusional, when in fact, every mathematical model of Bitcoins price shows a very high expected return.
Any amount of fundamental analysis also shows that interest and demand is only increasing.

No, not exponentially obviously - the economy doesn't grow exponentially. It will level off to a small growth rate, likely in 10-15 years.
But yes, it could rise in value forever provided there is always at least some growth in the economy.

Dude, yes. I'm literally starving right now. What time you going to be there till?

I heard Bay Area traffic has become worse than LA. Can anyone confirm?

Hmmm. I definitely commend you for having really thought a lot of this through. Something that can scarcely be said for anyone on the left. 
In many ways, Libertarians are Vulcans, wherein logic and reason are held to be the only tools appropriate for the construction of a political ideology.
I will check out the link you sent, in addition to pondering upon your points, which at face value, make sense.
I predict a growing number of young libertarians emerging in the coming years, and I'm glad crypto will be the vehicle driving this thought revolution.

Uhhh... his statement is based on a $2 trillion valuation of the crypto market, assuming a transfer of 1% of currency and gold deposits to crypto.
He clearly describes how he's coming to that valuation. Its not random.

The scalability issue is irrelevant IMO. Since there are multiple crpytocurrencies, people will naturally gravitate to using other ones as the Bitcoin network becomes more clogged. This will effectively spread the workload out over multiple blockchains. Bitcoin will serve first and foremost as a store of value; digital gold.

They are so hit and miss
