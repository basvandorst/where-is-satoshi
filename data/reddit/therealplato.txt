Dunno dude, transitioning from crony capitalism to market anarchy would be a hard task. I would like to see humans have shared title to common goods like air, water, land, and I think a lot of the property rights claimed by current market leaders are probably bogus. (i.e. oregon jailing dude for collecting rainwater.) 
I think the simplest transition would be a debt jubilee since most of the assets in the world are title to debts. It would be like a total economic reset. It would certainly cause some chaos but I have a feeling that the producers will pull through much more easily than those who make their living through usury and coercion.
edit: i wouldn't TAKE any personal property from anyone, even if they attained it through coercion, but I and others might refuse to recognize property rights to land and common goods.

Yeah, I do not have a solid stance on property yet. 
And I think I must eat my words because I realized that I might support taking property from someone if it aids justice. I like the non-aggression principle but some people only listen to force. If a justice system decides that asset confiscation is a just punishment for someone who hurt others or damaged their property - and that justice system actually produces justice - I'll call that confiscation legitimate.

Right, you plug the contracts into your software and when someone breaks a contract you publish that information. You look up the history of your counterparties before signing anything. It's like automating the  web of trust. You can listen to your friends and community to help determinine if someone's trusted.
Polycentric law simply means that different groups of people have different rulesets. One group could use a jury randomly selected from their entire population, let them skype in for discussion instead of travelling, let the public add comments to the trial. Maybe another group obeys a dictator. Maybe another group is the US Feds and US legal system. 
So, exactly what Neal Stephenson describes in Snow Crash and The Diamond Age.
If you publish the rules in a meshnet or online, you could automate a lot of stuff. Like maybe there's a common rule 'No Cameras'. You give it an icon and post it IRL, and all the wifi repeaters in the building broadcast it. And OS's that comply with that particular rule can disable their cameras.
Ha, you'd be placing locally applicable rulesets in an environment variable...

Are you saying that without police forces and welfare provided by the State, there will be no order? Short answer is, you can have order without States.
In my vision of ancapland, there are police forces, welfare systems, public schools and hospitals... BUT none of them is allowed to ever force anyone to participate or pay for anything or do anything. 
So if a mass of people want to pool their resources to pay for services, that's fine, they can draw up a contract that explains who is involved, who pays for it, what services are provided, etc. Perhaps there's a clause in the welfare contract that explicitly stipulates that money is never given to a person who didn't opt into the contract already. But perhaps the fire department contract leaves it up to the discretion of the firemen, whether to save non-contractee's homes.
Anyway, ancaps are convinced that we can have a society that functions smoothly and justly without ever coercing anyone. Free market police are a great example. They would use force once a perp points a gun at them or punches their client. Perhaps if someone is smoking pot on private property they might be escorted out. Undoubtedly there would be abuses, which is where polycentric law and competing justice systems matters. Come join us in for further discussion ;)

I dunno, just my personal gut feeling. If Goldman Sachs holds the title to a mountain, but a couple dozen guys go up the mountain and build log cabins and fish from the streams, I feel the homesteaders gain some property rights by using the land. Goldman might have some amount of rights too but I feel those claims are not as strong if they don't use the land.

Yeah, I didn't emphasize this point because the wall of text was getting intimidation. The purpose of mining is to make it really really difficult to find a valid solution (i.e. create a block) but really really easy (and fast) for everyone else to double check your work. The reward is just a financial incentive to get people to use their hardware to validate transactions for the network.

By that point in time we will be using Open Transactions cash that resolves instantly (instead of waiting for a block) and is ACTUALLY anonymous.
Trusted individuals or organizations will say "We are creating one million Awesomebux. You can buy them for 0.001 Bitcoins each, or redeem one thousand awesomebux for one of our Bitcoins."

Oh I don't see it replacing Bitcoin, I think they're mutually beneficial. Regarding the Awesomebux in my parent comment, the owner of the currency had better make damn sure he can cover his obligations by cashing people out to Bitcoin. If he tries to tell people "I'm giving out 1000 Awesomebux, each redeemable for 0.001 BTC. (By the way I only have half a Bitcoin in my wallet.)" Then 500 people will redeem their Awesomebux, 500 more will not be able to, and they will raise havoc and probably wreck the reputation of the currency, driving the value to zero. 
And don't forget that there are people who have valid reasons for wanting inflatable currencies - say, MMO developers. They could use OT to launch their own ingame currency that is still tradeable on OT forex exchanges. Their users are certainly taking a risk, but the users who really want to buy Fart-Resistant Bracers can buy in.
If the currency tanks, yeah, the MMO players get fucked.

if your power costs + hardware costs exceed the benefit you'll get from mining, spend the money on bitcoins instead.
Keep in mind that within a year block rewards will drop from 50btc to 25btc. This will probably help boost the price of coins, though, as people realize that they are becoming scarcer. Run the numbers with a few scenarios - what happens if you mine for 10 years and bitcoins remain at $5? what if they drop to $1? what if they grow to $10? $100? $1000? total network hashrates seem to correlate fairly well with the price of coins, so expect more people to mine (and for you to get less coins) as price rises.

Yeah one possible attack vector is compromising the developers.
Another is, Bitcoin integrates with the banking system; it gets popular and many/most bitcoin transactions go through banks (say, 90%); banks suddenly agree that they demand a protocol update where KYC info must be written into each transaction. This forces a blockchain split: miners must choose whether to stick with the original protocol (and lose 90% of their transaction fees... at least initially) or whether they will capitulate and start producing blocks with the KYC info.
Of course it would be fairly cheap for the banks to offer cash incentives to the miners to switch to the crippled protocol.

Right now everyone uses the Bitcoin system to send Bitcoins from one person to another. But, built into the system are a bunch of secret knobs and levers that let you unlock cheat codes. One thing you can do is twiddle the knobs and write a magic IOU note with 6 people's names on it, where 5 of them have to sign it in order for anyone to claim the funds.
This is useful because it would let you split your bitcoins up among 6 different Bitcoin banks. If one got hacked, you could still get your bitcoins from the other five, and the one that got hacked couldn't steal your bitcoins.
The problem is that this is a more complicated transaction than sending bitcoins from one person to another. This means that it takes more bits to write out the IOU note. The IOU note has to be saved in the a block. There's a limited amount of space in each block.
Two different developers figured out a way to make the IOU note shorter, saving space in the blockchain. Both are major changes. Old clients won't recognize new transactions and I'm sure there will be many many many unforseen consequences. The system is not broke so why would we fix it?
Also, developers in general are not in agreement on this issue and they've only been talking about it for a month.

It's really impossible to say. There's so many factors at play. The biggest one is adoption rate of Bitcoin. If it hits a critical mass it will become more valuable by many orders of magnitude since there's such a limited supply. Rick Falkvinge [did some math]( and at a rough estimate a single coin might be worth $10k if black markets start using it on any large scale.
If you have $1000 to spend, you could either buy 200 bitcoins, or two GPU's in a mining rig. If bitcoin fails, your 200 bitcoins are worthless, but you could still sell the GPU's. If bitcoin succeeds, you will need to make at least 200 bitcoins from your GPU's to "break even" and make it worthwhile to buy the hardware. If Bitcoin explodes when you've made 150 bitcoins, and millions more people start mining, it might take you years to generate that additional 50 bitcoins.
However, if Bitcoin fails or remains scarcely adopted, you might be able to make 200, 300, or 1000 bitcoins with that GPU.
the gribble bot on  on freenode calculates that at current mining difficulty, a 600 Megahash graphics card will generate 0.403 bitcoins per day. [Here's some estimates]( of hash rates for a card. 600 MHash is probably about $500 if you buy a used card, YMMV

Hey you should know that you don't need a whole Bitcoin. You can send less than one Bitcoin. For small transactions there is a fee of 0.005 Bitcoins. So, even with 0.1 bitcoins, you can send 20 transactions of 0.005+0.005 fee.

I stand corrected, you're right, both mining clients and users' clients will verify the chain part automatically - there's no need for user input to "select" an honest chain manually. My point was, a dishonest user could modify his mining client to append a tampered block to either a honest or dishonest chain. This wouldn't be very effective as hHonest users would ignore anything on the dishonest chain, including the miner giving himself more than 50 bitcoins as a reward. I'll edit for clarification.
