To get those Guns &amp; Ammo, you still have to sell your btc for usd; then use that USD.
Not only has actual btc consumer markets not expanded from when they started; the incidence of fraud has compounded lately in those marketplaces left. 
BTC is good money being driven out by bad; and is also subject to fraud and misunderstanding by the general public. (Many older folks don't feel like learning how to work a hardware wallet, etc, etc. More than a few scams have already occurred because of this.)
Extrapolate from this what you can.

This is the single best advertisement for a product I've ever read on Reddit. Maybe the whole of the internet.
I'm sorry for your losses. I'm assuming you and your cats are safe, and I'm glad for that.
Next stop, Trezor website.

Serious question,
is your salary dollar-denominated or bitcoin-denominated?
IE; are you getting $5000 worth of bitcoin every month or .5 BTC every month? For example, if the price drops, would you start receiving more bitcoin?

This right here is why I sold at 10k. Bought at 200 usd level and sold the vast majority.
The paper only talks as if one small private entity will have quantum (ie the first individual miner or small company to adopt). And by the time one miner or small company can adopt, so can many others. However, it doesn't take into account large corporate actors or even state actors which adopt quantum and begin mining just to re-write or disrupt the ledger. They could do so a years before quantum is adopted by the public at large.

Do you honestly need a definition?
When I refer to currency/money, I mean the economic definition of currency(a medium of exchange and store of value). I am not referring to the money supply (M1, M2, or others). 
Investment needs no definition. Even the academic definition of investment is roughly making use of the colloquial definition.
In any economics course, there are forces that shift demand and supply curves to the left or right. The supply curve is constant, as far as I can tell. I am suggesting that the demand curve shifts right due to the value of bitcoin as an 'investment', and left when it's held. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:33:25
This is a great point. Which would point more towards our demand curve being pushed to the right.

Of course, it would still trend up/down based upon whatever level we actually had utilized. If it ever significantly outpaced our GDP + Wealth, it most definitely is a bubble. Because if it is worth way more than someone could ever pay for it (in whatever goods), then it would never be traded, and therefore lose it's only real utility. So I do think it has an equilibrium, and would function much the same as other commodity markets.

I bought mining contracts when btc was 200/ea; that still run to this day. Not sure what you imply by weak hand.
I think discouraging people from buying, selling, or spending bitcoin actually hurts the movement. BTC's utility is derived from it being a currency and a store of value. A simple store of value is not good enough.
Remember, tulip buds effectively store value (they can be infinitely cut and replanted); this didn't stop tulipmania.

Its a meme. I wish people would say Hold. I wish people wouldn't revert to using memes as an argument for bitcoin, as it shows a lack of sophistication which does not paint btc investors/enthusiasts in a good light.

I prefer this terminology. I think it is better than milli-bitcoin.
We do need a 'Piece' as a standard unit of transaction. Transacting whole bitcoins would only be used for cars and such, and satoshi is not yet valuable enough.
Seriously we should come up with alternative naming systems other than something with 4-5 syllables. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:31:19
Aye. And as such the exchange owners/administrators might have a 'Code Black' type of thing to shut down trades.
Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. The regular markets do this.

I was curious, as it might be indicative of precautions used by exchanges. Though the domino affect is plausible.
If Coinbase goes down, traffic starts heading to other exchanges, which might go down, and so forth.

Right now the World's gdp is 77 trillion. Global money supply is 75 trillion. Just saying that if it is to function as a medium of exchange, this might be the rational equilibrium it would try to come to (all currencies/markets tend to an equilibrium as people trade them).
Now of course, you are right, maybe the amount btc is trying to cover isn't just GDP but GDP + Wealth. Or Maybe GDP + Wealth + Other Money Supplies. Which of course, makes it infinite and simply based upon the level of exploitation.

You should not use life-savings as terminology. It attaches undo emotional burden to the money invested.
You should have an 'investment fund'. This is an amount you save dedicated for such investments. Use a separate checking account and everything.
This way you don't feel like your 'life' is invested into this.
Also, please note, that your money is invested. Your life is not, and does not depend on this being successful or failing.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:39:51
The real question is: Is this not a bad indicator?
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:57:07
Buy when there is blood on the floor. 
I bought btc back at 200 in either 13/14. I sold everything but a few mining contracts (that still produce, amazingly) when it hit 10k. Of course, I spent some of it here and there.
I look at today's prices and I think this is the time to buy. Even more so if the prices dip lower.
Its not like I didn't warn people. More than a few comments on here were just that.
I know its shitty of me, but I'm hoping to see 5k before the end of the month. I've already started cost average purchases.
Edit: Forgot to add sell price.

How is that even possible? Isn't one of the main reasons for incorporation to separate personal and company liability?
The courts would have had to prove some sort of criminal malfeasance to pierce the veil and then go after his home. More than likely he needed 800, or maybe he didn't believe in Apple as a company.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:46:38
Indeed.

But there are far more than 21 million working adults in the United Stated.
I don't stand by this, but I think the most logical would be to compare it to the GDP of the World. At 78 Trillion, that would put bitcoin at 3.7 million.
