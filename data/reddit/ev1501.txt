Just remember to rebuy the BTC after making the purchase. Don’t make the same mistake from years ago.

After using Circle's service do you feel that it was significantly better and easier to use than Coinbase?  I like Coinbase and it is pretty simple to use for everyone in this sub but I can see how it might be a little confusing for a typical person.

Teelm, you turned your 100 bit investment on my meme into 1000's of bits.  Capitalism at its finest :)

Good point, but wouldn't there need to be a certain amount of bitcoin tied up at any one time.  Technically removing it from the supply.

I agree,  what I am really curious about is whether the BTC flood gates will open up during the presidential race.  In the same way that social networking was fully integrated during Obama's first presidential race.

The price doesn't have much to hold it up currently besides speculation right now.  The second that all this behind the scenes development produces a legit consumer or business app that gains widespread acceptance the price will go up and stay up.  I would imagine until then we can see prices all over the place and as low as sub-$100.  Fun times never the less.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:51:44
Won't some of them just move to another exchange and possibly dump?

I'm honestly curious, what is the motivation behind posting negative comments repeatedly using this 2 day old account?  Just for the hell of it try providing a valid counter point to what i wrote above.  I do think Bitcoin should be scrutinized more so than it is on this sub.  I just wish the majority of its detractors provided substantial counter points instead of the uninformed and unfounded replies you seem to respond with.
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:02:23
It would probably just improve my view of Kerpeles, but not by much.

While there were many scams in the bitcoin world bitcoin itself is not a scam.  Concerning the blockchain if it is bitcoin's blockchain that ends up being used worldwide then the currency will be worth something as that is the incentive mechanism that keeps the blockchain going..
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:13:36
Good point but coinbase might be able to circumvent some of the actual local infrastructure WU had to build in each country in order to handle physical cash.  Assuming customers can start to use bitcoin directly in some cases to buy goods.  Obviously there are alot of moving parts and its difficult to see how this will play out exactly.  
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:17:13

Actual per their blog page it says they are not against big blocks 
"Liquid has nothing to do with block size or on-chain scaling issues in general. Increasing the block size would not grant near-instant transaction functionality, only more transactions per block. The need for Liquid would still exist even if the block size was 8 GB.
Blockstream has not taken a position on the block size debate, but rather adheres to Bitcoin’s consensus process. Many members of our team participate as independent contributors to Bitcoin development, but i f you’ve been following the discussion, you know even the team here doesn’t always agree with each other. That’s a good thing, in our opinion. We try to hold each other to the same standard of public validation and support as we do our colleagues outside the company."

So when would you buy back in? I would imagine it would have to be a decent amount before 12k to account for the capital gains taxes you had to pay on the sale. 
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:58:08
and i think he predicted $200k+ either in 2022 or 2023.  Lets hope lightning strikes twice.

How odd that all negative bitcoin posters have accounts that are hours old

BTC price has a shorter expiration than milk.  When we hit a new recent high everyone is like "Hell Yeah!" then after 3-5 days of sideways action the same people are "BTC price is starting to smell like sh$t"
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:49:10
I agree with what you are stating about downward pressure.  Its because there isnt a solid use case or mainstream app yet hence my post.  If you "Can't see more people fooled" then why are you even here? I don't like Beanie babies so I don't waste time on that subreddit criticizing people.
