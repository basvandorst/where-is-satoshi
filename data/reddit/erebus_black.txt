It is being treated as an asset as much of the reason why it is bought and held is because they expect the price of it to increase. 
The problem with using it as money is the high fees for small purchases which is why coins like Litecoin and even Bitcoin Cash are better for everyday use.
Buying bigger things isn't too bad I guess.
Lightning network will help with this in the future as this should significant reduce fees and speed up transactions.

So people are cashing out into fiat.
A lot of jumping onto Bitcoin Cash.
Most other alts are actually only marginally down vs Bitcoin.
 I guess there is confidence that when this mess is complete the rest of the altcoins will go up again.

I don't think so.
There was a 84 minute gap between blocks 494039 and 494040.
So many unconfirmed transactions. The network is clogged.

A fork doesn't mean a split chain...
Bitcoin has hard forked before without create duplicate chains
BCH is not going up because of the fork, it is likely going up due to uncertainty about Segwit2X

Not a correction.
The scaling problem was solved all alone. 
Just increase the bloody blocksize.

Remember when Bitcoin reached $1000 for the first time?

Roger Ver bad, Blockstream good
There can be no dissent!

This is completely different. 
Bitcoin is losing is market share to due Bitcoin Cash.
Interesting when it originally forked, Bitcoin's price wasn't really affected but it much.
I did think that Segwit2X Bitcoin would have taken value from Bitcoin if the fork had occured. It didn't but looks like        the other fork is now inflicting the pain!

Lol it looks like that Bitcoin Gold had the right idea all along.

I really hope this isn't the reason bitcoin is dropping.
Oh dear.

Oh of course, but why did bitcoin drop when Silk Road closed?
