I already have one. Though it's a bit old. Q6600, Radeon 4890. 
Overclocked it so much it's clutching its chest, but runs stuff perfectly well.

IMO it's more complex, it's more of a feedback loop. It's currently way more profitable to buy BTC than to buy mining hardware. This drives the price up when people buy BTC, but that increase also causes an increased rate of mining (as mining is still profitable, but less so, with a much lower risk, as hardware can be resold, so people are still mining)

Hey, I appreciate the writeup. It does sound rather specialised. I'm sure I could implement the technical aspects but I can see that a whole lot of research is required. Although I imagine one way I could get into it would be to offer coding expertise to someone already in the game. Outside of work I typically spend my time playing video games though, so I don't know if I could be fucked unless I become unemployed or something.
On the other hand, $600/day would be a raise..

That sounds a lot like speculation. lets invest in bitcoin cause the price will go up! 
@_date: 2011-05-11 06:20:50
If price remains stable
Hence why I believe it's a bubble/overvalued. 


As long as there are people willing to accept BTC. Since the majority of participants are probably not looking for 10kg of heroin, a price crash will lead to nobody wanting to buy BTC (except criminals/minority demographics). Like a property crash, pretty much.

It's actually a power struggle, believe it or not. Government desperately wants to cling on to power but are increasingly at the mercy of corporations. 
@_date: 2011-05-10 05:28:10
Yes, it's a bubble. How many of you purchase services with BTC? If not, why else would you buy a bitcoin? Because it'll be worth more in a week or a month. 
That's the very *definition* of a bubble. 
Nobody buys $40,000 of web hosting. As there are currently no car dealers who accept BTC I'll assume it's a speculative purchase or a mafia deal. One is more likely then the other..
However, I'm just as happy to exploit the short-term climate in order to get a couple of gfx cards for free.

You expect antivirus programs to have signatures for trojans which are designed to infect an incredibly small number of people? Are you serious? The instant a signature is developed, the authors can just change the program to evade the antivirus heuristics. And it all depends heavily on antivirus vendors getting samples of each trojan that appears so that they can create a signature for it. This is unlikely when they're not designed to cast a wide net like the majority of malware (strategy: infect everybody on the planet if possible). Given that it would probably take about a day to write a new version, &amp; antivirus vendors are not likely to be able to detect new versions for more than a week at least, it's clear who will win this battle, and who will lose (users with Windows users / Adobe PDF Reader installed I'm guessing)
The best advice I can give is very simple
* **Do not browse the internet, use IRC or do anything unrelated on a mining PC / any PC with a wallet.dat**
* Any PCs with wallet.dat should probably be airgapped from net-browsing PCs
* Don't use Windows or Adobe products? :p

Consider if you were buying 16. You'd ordinarily have to set up 4 PCs (possibly 3 PCs if you get EVGA Classified mobos but that turns out to not be worth it). However if you were buying 6990s then you'd only need two PCs and would save on personal time and effort.

Well, if America suddenly blocked all bitcoin traffic (it wouldn't surprise me *at all*), America would be effectively "cut off" from everywhere else. 
Aside from that, if a massive earthquake knocked out lines from America to Japan/surrounds, bitcoin is a decentralised P2P network, so presumably American nodes would be able to connect to European nodes, which would be connected to Japanese nodes and would be able to relay data as a proxy between the two continents. As I understand it at least.. still haven't studied the protocol in detail. 
@_date: 2011-06-15 06:24:25
@_date: 2011-06-17 03:45:27
now that's an interesting approach indeed. IMO it would prompt malware authors to find a way around it (such as accessing the disk natively, rather than through the windows file system driver, or running a program on startup/bootup via infecting MBR or some other common method that can get the file before the protection program runs). I'd rather take a more intrinsically secure approach by limiting surface area of possible attack vectors, keeping it on a windows box that's in general use just increases the number of things to defend against by orders of magnitude, which is bad. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 07:06:46
TBH their CA would probably hand over the private keys to whatever certs they use anyway.

Paypal doesn't send money. It sends an electronic message to a bank that relays information.
The bank then doesn't even give the recipient money. It adds the number to the recipient's balance, which represents money owed to the recipient by the bank. If the bank suddenly folds, the recipient isn't getting that money.
Totally different to handing someone a wad of cash. I don't see how that's reversible either. 
What you really want: paypal-like services that accept BTC, btc banking services. *Not* fundamental alterations in the way BTC works - which it does for very good reasons.

To be honest, it would be way easier to just hack deep bit. You'd better believe that someone at the NSA would have a Linux or BSD 0day.  It's a significant weakness in bitcoin because it effectively centralizes a protocol that's supposed to be robust via decentralization. 
All the attacker needs is to hack Deepbit and anything else that gives them another 2% or whatever the figure is, or just use one of their data centers to make up the remaining network capacity.

Would they change it around for $500,000? Personally, I'd learn quantum mechanics for $500,000.

Numerous people are sitting on piles of tens of thousands of bitcoins. I don't see how they can be used *currently*. There are more bitcoins in the market than things people would want to buy with them. Hence, bitcoins are 'overvalued'.

Increased difficulty will push prices up, but not as much as the speculation around the price going up will do so..

BTC doesn't have any "real" value aside from electricity costs. Everything else is speculation. Delicious, profit-generating speculation. 
Recap for anyone who isn't totally sure. Let's suppose that the exchange is $20/BTC. If speculation doesn't exist, if it costs $20 in electricity to produce 1BTC, $20 worth of pot should properly cost 1BTC. However, speculation does exist, and some third party has to sell that 1BTC to the pot buyer in the first place, for $20. If they think the price will rise in the future, they won't sell their BTC, they'll hoard it. But maybe someone else thinks $25 is enough to sell, &amp; if the lowest price to sell on MtGox is $25, then that's the "price" they show in charts etc. 
The real electricity costs, given current difficulty and mining at 800Mhash with normal hardware, are about $1/BTC. And that's only because speculation has driven difficulty up exponentially over the past few months. A few increases ago it was more like $0.20/BTC.

Wait, so your argument is that Bitcoin isn't a bubble because of an assertion that people act rationally...? 
@_date: 2011-05-24 03:38:03


That's a good point, but IMO the current popular assumption is that while BTC is overvalued due to speculation, further speculation will still net profit. Kind of like certain commodities. This is an assumption on my part however and you could easily be more correct.
Have a spare 150k lying around to test it out ? :P
@_date: 2011-08-16 02:32:25
If you actually want to buy things in bitcoins, you're essentially making a bet that the value of those bitcoins will not go up if you hadn't spent them. Hence greater commerce is sign of a price collapse :p

I've seen buy offers for tens of thousands of BTC on mtgox.

The difficulty increases occur more frequently as total hash rate (ie total blocks/hour) increases, so it becomes more fine-grained in that sense. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 01:42:09
oh, yeah, that.

I disagree with this. They'll just take massive loans from banks and repay them with taxes over time. Sounds similar to how bonds work but I'm not so knowledgeable of economics. Or they'll print *someone else's* currency. Or raise an immediate tax as a percentage of assets. 
@_date: 2011-06-23 05:17:48
No, they'd be idiots to take the million.
First, I'd be surprised if they hadn't made a mill already just through operating the exchange, but by operating the largest exchange on the 'net they will definitely make more than that in the future (as long as they hire some security people)
@_date: 2011-05-23 05:45:02
The rate of difficulty growth will arrest but difficulty won't actually go down. The only reason why it increased was to correct for the immediate profitability for buying hardware - whereas paying off 4x6990s will take 4-6x as long with slated difficulty increases. The network's output consists of people who already own hardware so I suppose they won't suddenly stop making free money.
The difficulty also won't go up beyond a certain point until AMD's new line of graphics cards come out or BTC rises in value significantly. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 06:12:54
With the volume of dating spam around, I'm sure you don't mind one more person getting in on it.. how does it work?
@_date: 2011-05-10 06:38:52


That is a good point. If I can't know if the growth is sustainable then I'm still cautious. Bitcoin is organised over the net, and the Internet communicates sentiment very efficiently. 
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:09:53


As I said rather more tersely in another comment, the instant that your wallet's dollar value approaches something like your regular monthly salary, you should consider a month of proper technical research into securing it worthwhile.

Those are small amounts. Relax. I know people who fancy themselves investors who've had to re-mortgage their houses..
@_date: 2011-05-19 08:31:49
I don't think so, people are already invested in their hardware. There might technically be a drop from people who just realised their electricity costs more than their output, but they're operating extremely low-hashrate hardware (like CPUs, nVidia/old GPUs)
What will change, however, is the rate at which hashrate is increasing. But probably not immediately, as a lot of people would have bought hardware this week and will be in the middle of setting it up. When difficulty jumps suddenly, people realise that speculating by buying BTC is more profitable than buying mining rigs, so acceleration of difficulty decreases and USD/BTC goes up. Trend could always be bucked by too much price volatility (looks risky) or people creating massive mining botnets.
