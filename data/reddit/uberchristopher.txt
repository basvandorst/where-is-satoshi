Oh man, lol.  Only a bank could get away with that.  "Shit man, I'm so sorry my company lost all your money and went bankrupt.  Tell ya what.  I'm going to give you some of my worthless company."
Edit:  Then of course the government comes in and says:  "Hey guys.  Oh, looks like you really fucked up.  Well don't worry see, I got all these stupid motherfuckers convinced that they must give me their money and I'll do things for them.  Here have a whole bunch, give yourself another raise.  We got 'em convinced you're too big to fail and they actually want us to give you their money.  The best part is, non of them realize that all they need to do to stop me is revoke their consent to be governed.  They just think that they have to listen to me because I'm the government.  They even get mad when one of them tries to inform the others of the truth.  LMFAO."

It's a bit of a rabbit hole to get into, but for a lot of us it's about what a dollar actually is.  I have no clue what a EUR is but a USD and a CAD is a piece of paper that represents someone else's debt as opposed to anything valuable.  A debt left to its own devices grows and grows with interest, so for every dollar under your mattress, somebody somewhere needs to provide their labour to pay the .03 -.20 dollars interst on it every year.  To make matters worse he can only pay that interest with money that somebody somewhere else is labouring to pay interest on.  It's a game of musical chairs that we call fractional reserve banking.  That's why so many countries have astronomical national debts.  Somewhere along the line we decided that some dudes can print the currency we need, LOAN it to us, and make us pay them back with more than what they printed in the first place. 
This is why sustainability is bad for the economy.  Money is just energy currents.  We exchange our energy, through labour and resource extraction, for money that can be used to acquire the products of someone else's energy.  When you have one group that's allowed to make money without putting any of their own energy in, all the others eventually become their slaves.  We need to continuously put our labour and natural resources into the interest vacuum that is created alongside our money supply.  That's how the banks end up with all the real properties when the economy crashes.  They just gather up all the things that people bought with the money *they* created because they didn't create the money to pay the interest alongside the money they created to loan out (when you pay a loan it goes back to zero and the bank is left with the interest you paid them).
That's it for a lot of people who are moving towards cryptos.  If you don't believe or understand this, than you should only buy bitcoin if you want to save $$ on a decent sized transfer of funds.  But even then, exchanges are going to take a cut at both points of conversion to fiat so you need to do some homework there.  The only other reasons I can think of would be for the anonymity (difficult with Btc), or if you wish to speculate on the price and try to make $$ as an investor.

Have patience.  These are some questions that come to mind:  What's your website?  Does your target demographic compare to your average btc user?  Have you been networking or advertising specifically within the BTC community?  If you consider the percentage of people using btc out of everybody, then I'm not too surprised at your figure.  ie. if 1% of your audience uses btc, then you might expect $2.50 in btc for every $250 from google, and I think it's probably still a lot lower than 1% adoption among the general public.  If you're selling mining hardware though, or blogging about cryto or something, I'd expect a lot more.  Also, just an afterthought, but maybe the ads are discouraging those who would tip (why pay him twice?), is it possible to disable them for a few weeks and see if you get more tips?

No no.  Not sarcasm at all.  I was trying to point out fuck the bank!  I don't know, it made sense in my head at the time...but I had just woken up.  Now I can't really see where my logic was coming from.  I guess it had something to do with how I think bitcoin is helping people be their own banks, but that's not really about loans...  sorry for the confusion.
EDIT:  I think pretty much any discussion ab BTC is good for BTC because I really believe in it and I see how it weathers through all sorts of shit.  The "negative" stuff just helps people see what not to do and BTC comes out stronger every time (so far).  It's the honey badger element of BTC.

@_date: 2014-03-15 22:49:00
I'm confused now, I thought you were saying that *op* is offering a bet that the price of bitcoin will rise, so that's what I was correcting, then you say "right."


That's why I said the whole thing is pretty pointless and proves nothing in the end except that people like to feed their egos with arbitrary irrelevant arguments (my dad could beat up your dad).
I don't even really know what Buffett's point was.  The only thing about BTC that I saw mentioned in the article is that it's a "mirage," (just like any fiat currency.)  If that's his point, I'd take an open source mirage over one controlled and manipulated privately for the benefit of the super rich at the expense of sustainability and the greater good any day of the week.

@_date: 2014-03-22 22:45:58
In this case, I think there are more factors at play.  Bitcoins aren't exactly scarce (there *is* supply), but they're still sort of complicated to access for the first time, especially for those who try to fully understand them before attempting to buy some.  So right now, potential adopters need to have a high enough level of interest/curiosity to motivate them through the process of actually getting a few.  Once they get there (find someone they trust enough, go through verification processes, agree on a price, and set up the transfer) there's plenty of btc waiting to be bought.  My 2 cents here is that demand is stiffled a little due to these barriers.  I think demand and prices would be a little higher if they were easier to get.  Know'msay'n?

One other very important thing to know about when using paper wallets is change addresses.  This is how I understand it: each transaction consists of 1 input and 2 (or more) outputs.  **The entire balance of an address moves with each transaction,** like handing a cashier a $50 bill.  The address is emptied of its coins (the input), the payment is made to the specified public key (output), and the leftover "change" is delivered to a change address, or **if no change address has been specified, the change goes to the lucky miner who solves the block.**
I'm still figuring this out myself and haven't found much info from wallet software I've used except by trial and (thankfully no) error.  Different client software handles change differently.  Bitcoin-qt creates and handles change addresses for you and uses a new one every time you send coins (apparently someone attempting to betray your anonymity can tell which addresses were created together).  Mycellium on my android sends the change back to the address of the input.  **I've heard some programs don't do well with change from imported (as opposed to created in-app) keys.**  This means that when you spend from a paprer wallet it is important to move all the coins to another address before spending anything short of the entire balance.
Make a few, put small amounts on them, and practise importing them and moving coins around, if your client doesn't tell you what address the change is assigned to, look it up on blockchain.info.  Just don't assume your coins are in the same address you had them in after a transaction.
That might be what you're feeling you're missing...

My first thoughts on reading this is who gets the fees that Counterparty users are paying for the community resources that they use?  Considering everyone running a full node is storing all that extra data, it sounds like a situation of the the few reaping rewards for the work of the many.  I know we're not talking about any significant amount of data but at the same time it IS a doubling of the potential size of transactions and therefore the size of the blockchain.  Considering how big it is already - despite its infancy - I can't see this being a good thing over the course of the next 20 years and beyond.

Seems a natural progression of common language to shorten long words because we're people who like to talk so we find ways to make saying things easier/faster.  We took millibitcoins and shortened it to millibits and now we've started calling microbitcoins bits.  So now a millibit = a kilobit.  Nope, definitely don't understand humans.

I think it's the second one tbh, they're warning me against using a system I know nothing about.  For now I decided to just create some paper wallets and use my holey windows machine to move the coins into them.
[Here's]( the original thread (it's not huge if you don't mind humouring me further).  
Here's some comments:
@_date: 2014-01-06 11:06:47


Yup, I basically just finished doing all that =)  Had to use my windows machine online for the transactions, so that was fun, but I added to addresses first and only connected to execute (not sure why, just felt safer).  Feeling much more secure now.  I like to think my machine's a little more tidy than the average user because I try to be careful about what I click on, I don't use toolbars and shit, and I use no script and adblock...so that's sort of good I guess.  I don't know, I also don't pay for avast or spybot, but I use them and keep things updated.  It's funny, I've only ever had to worry ab malware stealing my privacy, or messing with my computer.  Now I gotta make sure it's not stealing a chunk of my savings.  I guess we're in the future.


Doing that too, I guess it's just been a little slower than I was hoping.  I generally pick things up pretty fast, but I'm so ADD when it comes to computers, it always takes me a long time to filter through to what's important.
And yeah, I should have been more clear, they weren't saying there's anything wrong with linux, just that it's more prone to user error.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:15:15
It's what people are used to.  For the last 80 years, we've only dealt with money as a centralized, trust-based currency.  People just need time to figure out that bitcoin takes a little bit of personal responsibility to use properly.  We're all being dumbed-down at the moment...give it time.
And for everyone else, store it safely!

@_date: 2014-02-22 10:59:11
I was thinking something along these lines.  Bear with me as these are just my thoughts as they are coming and I don't have an economics background at all.  But...
Ignoring fluctuations in specific commodity values relative to each other, deflating currencies will decrease prices across the board and inflating currencies will increase prices.  Costs and revenues should basically move together against a fluctuating currency so the difference is negligible to manufacturers, merchants, and workers.
The difference lies in holding onto things.  In an inflationary system people need to accumulate stuff with the money from their labours in order to save value.  This means they need to buy things, and invest in company's that are turning natural resources into things.  With nobody able to hold their cash, the system needs to continue consuming resources as people struggle in their attempts to gain enough wealth to be comfortable.  This system depends on an infinite supply of natural resources.  Our natural resources are quite measurable...I digress.
I think in a deflationary system, people would be driven to consume for the fulfillment of needs and pleasures, and not just to keep a sinking ship afloat.  People would still find profit in supplying things, but the culture of excess might wane (maybe along with the wealth gap).  Just thinking that if everybody wasn't battling inflation for their savings, we wouldn't need an economy based on creating and junking as much useless shit as possible in order to keep people above the poverty line.
I think people would be just as happy and find way more abundance in an economy that doesn't need to constantly expand to keep up with an ever expanding money supply.
Does any of that make sense?

Theft is a concern though.  I think you have to take that into account for this argument.  It took me a long time to get comfortable with storing my own coins.  I'd never trust a derivative, but many do.  It's an "oh, you mean instead of figuring out all this complicated shit, I can just trust my government to back this paper" type of situation.  We live in a world of limited liability where no one needs to take responsibility for their existence.

That's always the thing, hindsight is 20/20.  Don't let yourself get too down about opportunities you missed by being cautious.  At the time you sold, it was all speculation.  You doubled your money and made a decision to cash out, and you never could have known what the price was going to do next.  Even now, it could all crash down or reach the moon in a week.  You just try to learn the best strategy for you and your comfort level.  I like the advice to sell 1/2 when the price doubles from what you paid.  Have I done that?  No.  Emotions stopped me, but I also bought early in 2013 without a lot to spend so my initial investment wasn't more than I could afford to lose.  Also, pure dumb luck has shown me some pretty good profits on that half I didn't sell.  Still, I'm fully aware that I have nothing that's not in my hand, and my private keys won't buy me shit if it all crashes.  That wasn't all just for you...I'm drunk ;p

I'll take a stab at this.
People hate what they don't understand and btc takes a lot of research to understand fully.
It starts with shoddy, profit-driven "journalism."  They print what sells and facts are boring.  They know what people will consume so they give them that, and consume it we do, voraciously.  
Despite this, somehow people still think that if it's in the news, it must be true, where really, if it's in the news, it must be what the news corps think people/advertisers will pay for.
Somehow I think people just forget that in a capitalist system, nothing that comes from for-profit corporations exists but for the creation of profits.  They're accountable to their shareholders, not to journalistic integrity, so they produce easily-regurgitated drivel and distractions.  Misunderstanding and therefore hatred perpetuate from there.
Edit:  Well that sounded pretentious as fuck.  Going with it anyways.

My comment was a bit of a joke...of course the banks want to keep things as easy as possible for themselves.  So would you say BMO is staying away for now because btc just isn't high enough on their radar to warrant possibly having to try to implement new compliance regs after the fact?  As long as they're not breaking any laws by closing peoples' accts. and impeding commerce, then they have no reason not to wait until the government makes their decisions.
I don't see what the big deal is for AML concerns when the entire blockchain is public.  It makes so much more sense to go with that than anonymous cash from an LE pov I'd think...but I don't know whether our politicians are really into putting effort into things.  It would seem as though getting elected was the end goal for most of the ones that have any power.

Practice with small amounts to be sure:  bring in a paper wallet with a tiny amount of btc on it, send most (not all) of that tiny amount to a new address and see where the change went on blockchain.info.  When I set up my paper wallets, I was worried about this too.  Turns out, the wallet I use on my android, Mycelium, just uses the same address I sent from to put the change back into.

There's no morality in for-profit journalism.  It's not for informing the public on important issues, it's not for unveiling truths or reporting facts.  Its sole purpose is to generate quarterly profits.  So the argument is valid, she was just doing her job, just like the people who drove trains full of jews to Auschwitz.  The point is moot though, has nothing to do with what a **** she is and it doesn't defend her in any way.  I don't get how people still think the media is supposed to bring us news and information about our lives and the world.

Modern economic theory comes from the people who profit from the modern economy.  Inflationary currencies (which economists love so much) in a closed sytem (Earth) will only work until there aren't any resources left because everybody needs to produce things to keep up with a steadily declining dollar value.  A funnier joke is how much you (your parents?) probably spent on your tuition.  Not that it matters to you, you'll be ok.  As more and more people wake up and decide we should leave something for our grandkids, the elite are going to need a lot of "economists" to try to keep the public mystified about the insanity of it all.

Sort of, I guess it's a lesson for many.  When I first started looking to get some bitcoins a year ago, GOX was the major exchange.  I coudn't get an account because they didn't serve Canada if I recall correctly.  But I looked into it and would have.  Then the question is whether I would have known enough to avoid using them for storage.  Bitcoin is pretty complex for the average user so for all the people who tried to get in fast (ie. without doing the hours and hours of research and setting up an OS and software "securely" that it tales to get comfortable enough to trust oneself to create a wallet), Gox was a well known and respected company that seemed to be a community institution.  I'd argue most people didn't know what they were getting into...  Not that that makes them any less responsible for not doing their homework.
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:22:02
Because I care about the planet.  Our current economy, founded around debt-based fiat currencies, is dependent on a constant supply of new natural resources to keep the ponzi scheme running (ie. to get money out of the pool to pay interest on the money in the pool).  Continuing consumption of natural resources is the only way to generate value to pay the interest that's compounding on the money supply.  When new bitcoins are created, nobody demands they be paid back with along with some of the bitcoins that were created in the past.  I think we should be using the earth's natural resources based on need, and not frantically trying to keep up with a system destined to make us all slaves in a barren wasteland.

The block-chain wouldn't have it. If we're talking about someone creating securities that "represent" bitcoin, then only the people who bought into those would be vulnerable unless the government decided to pass another law mandating that these "securities" be accepted as bitcoin.  Maybe they'll try to legislate everyone to turn over their bitcoin for some paper notes that represent bitcoin.  Worked pretty well for them when they did that with gold.

You're pretty close (in your summary of my question).  And within your answer is the concept that I'm wondering about.  Essentially, how do we justify an economy that needs to be perpetually growing in order to keep up with the drain caused by using a currency that's created as interest-bearing debt?
Nothing you said conflicts with what I think I know, but is there any flaw in my question that you can see? 
@_date: 2015-03-01 01:16:04
They thing is, banks don't simply loan out depositors' money.  They monetize IOUs.  They create the money when a borrower agrees to the terms of a loan.  That creates a liability (a negative amount) on their side of the ledger and a positive (an asset) on the borrower's side. It all has to return to 0 when the borrower has paid off the debt.  In the meantime, the borrower is feeding interest to the bank with money that wasn't created by the loan in question.  The borrower has to get that money by extracting value from somewhere else and handing it over to the bank.  It's why our economy depends on perpetual growth.
This is what I understand, so is this right?  Or what am I missing?
And thanks for having this discussion with me, it helps me to formulate my thoughts so I know what to ask, and it opens me to new concepts which will hopefully help me see that it's not as bad as I think.  There's too much mystery regarding the mechanics of money and I think it's important to understand. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 01:30:07
That's kind of how my view has been shaping up so I'm trying to see how it's not like that.  I wish people would tell you why they think you're wrong instead of just voting you down.  What you're saying, though, is why I suspect our economy is so dependant on perpetual growth. We need to keep borrowing more or extracting value from our surroundings to keep up with the drain.

@_date: 2015-02-28 16:47:35
My question is, if a bank creates money by loaning it out, therefore creating an asset and a liability which in essence must balance back out to 0 to be settled, where is the money to pay the interest supposed to come from?  When the debt *is* settled out back to 0 and the bank is then holding x amount they made from the interest, that amount could only be missing from another interest-bearing loan that can never be settled to 0 because there's money missing now.  How is this not a game of musical chairs that will end in financial ruin for everyone except the bank?  And how is it not fraud?
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:32:05
Right.  Backed by law: the very definition of fiat currency.  I forgot that one.  An yeah, the cognitive dissonance was sort of a shower thought as I was running away with that last one.

My guesses:
-A promise.  The Gov promises it will force it's people to accept it.  Although given that the Gov is just a bunch of politicians, this wouldn't give me much faith.
-Faith (speaking of which).  -We believe people will accept it. 
-IOUs -Kind of the same as the first two.  Because insolvency is akin to slavery, and we believe no one wants to be a slave so IOUs are enough.
-"The full faith and credit" of the US Gov.  -Essentially promises made by liars. 
-The fact that we will perpetually need to expand the economy by donating our labour and finite natural resources to funnel money towards interest payments on the debt that is our money supply.  That, along with a prayer that those finite resources will be magically replenished in perpetuity.  In essence: cognitive dissonance. 
These are my guesses.  Please tell me I'm wrong.  What's your answer?

Personally, I love it, but I love driving so it's natural.  To clarify, we DO get a piece rate per stop and a little bit of gas money: not enough to actually cover our gas use when we're busy, but when we're busy, we get more pieces and tips.  When there are no deliveries, we don't make anything waiting around.  I had 2 whole deliveries in a 6 hr shift once, and I've had 28 deliveries in a 7.5 hr shift.  Our tips generally account for about half of what we make.  Some people understand the customary 15% for good service and most give us about 10% on avg.  I suspect there are a lot of people who think we get minimum wage or whatever and I think most of those make up the ones that give a dollar, maybe two, no matter how big their bill or just don't tip at all and think "eeeannnhh, I don't get tips for doing MY job."

Early adopters don't get to charge interest on all bitcoins in circulation.  They don't get free money from the money in circulation.

I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to create a never-been-online cold storage wallet machine.  Lots of people are advising along these lines yet I can't find anyone that can help make it happen.  People like to talk about all this proper security they're doing but somehow no one I've talked to can tell me how to install anything on an offline linux installation.  I consider myself a fairly efficient problem solver/grasshopper, but I'm starting to think I should learn how to hack wallets because apparently securing your btc away from online machines is a myth.  Not trying to rain on anyone's parade, just trying to engage sound security and I'm frustratingly stumped.
As for your question: As more and more money is continuously loaned into existence, it devalues what is already circulating.  On top of that, it comes into existence bearing compounding interest, which needs to be paid to the banks with money already in circulation, as the banks don't create the money for the interest when they create the money for the loan.  That sounds silly, but when you consider that without a gold standard, ALL the money we need to use to live, die and pay taxes comes from interest bearing loans, you start to see how we're slowly being enslaved.  It's musical chairs except we're working our asses off producing the wealth of a nation so we can pay the banks for the money we use instead of dancing and having fun.  When the music stops all you can hear is the sound of the banks foreclosing on hard-working people's homes.
We've gone through a few rounds of this and we're only seeing it get worse.  More and more people are waking up to how broken it is and bitcoin is going to start to look pretty great compared to tanking fish-hook money.  Even if people stop waking up to the fact that the current system is stealing their lives and leaving them with nothing but debt to pass on to their children, the government is hell-bent on devaluing their money so the BTC charts will start looking better and better.
TL/DR:  Because fiat is killing us and we're starting to wake up.

I imagine you get some sort of wage for your job.  We don't get an hourly wage AND we tip out our kitchen 3% of our sales.  If you want to be an asshole and make a guy work for free, at least tip him 3% so he doesn't have to pay money to bring your ungrateful ass your food on top of the gas, insurance and maintenance he's paying.  I don't know what country you live in, but many businesses in Canada can only afford to keep a driver around if they're not paying them hourly.  If you live in Canada, I hope you stand corrected and realize that you've got some sucking up to do the next time that delivery guy shows up.  We've got a regular who orders at least twice a week and never tips, we calculated that as drivers we tip the kitchen about $200/year just for her.

Do you know much about mint?  I've been pondering linux on my laptop for a while, installed ubuntu, but didn't like it.  And now your comment has got me looking into Mint.  I'm not a linux guy at all, but I learn quickly, and I generally prefer more options over dumbed-downedness (hence my looking into linux in the first place).  That didn't come out quite right as simplicity and aesthetic are important too.
Can't find much info for selecting a download, and it seems there are a lot of choices.  Debian?  Cinnamon, Mate, a bunch women's names?  -confused EDIT:  shitty grammar

Thanks, yeah, I'm currently educating myself on change addresses.  It's interesting that bitcoin-qt doesn't really inform a guy ab change addresses, considering they're so crucial when using some other methods.  It seems like just dumb luck that I didn't lose all my bitcoins through lack of awareness, and I consider myself pretty paranoid/anal when it comes to things I don't understand.
EDIT:  I do know how to make a paper wallet with my offline linux machine, so that's a start.  I was just trying to avoid making the actual transaction from my regular online holey windows machine...I've said to much!  *bombs self*

"repaying it in anything that is universally acceptable," is he saying this because he's incapable of understanding a currency that isn't debt based and earning interest (payable only in interest bearing debt-currency) to an elite?
The trust of the individual issuing the money is our trust in the software having been reviewed and tested by the early adopters and the community as a whole.  I trust THAT waaaaaay more than I trust the private central banks and the Stephen Harpers of the world.  But then, I trust the addicts that used to hang out by the payphone at Mac's more than them too.

Bitpay offers retailers a way to accept bitcoin while remaining protected from the price fluctuations by locking the price they get for their btc to the the exchange rate at the time a customer spent them (or simply exchanging them for fiat as soon as they are recieved as payment?).  Basically if a customer buys a $25 item and pays in btc, the retailer is guaranteed to get $25 for those btcs.  That's all I know ab that (not sure ab any fees involved etc.)

Canadian pizza driver here.  I gotta chime in.  Many people don't realize that we don't get an hourly wage, ie. we often sit around for hours making nothing, AND we have to tip out our kitchen an amount equal to 3% of our total sales.  That means if you order $33 worth of food and tip less than a dollar, I've just paid out of my pocket for the honour of driving food to your ungrateful ass (Not you personally fine Brit, we haven't developed the tech for overseas pizza deliveries yet).

So THAT's how apt-get knows what to grab.  I thought it was some sort of linux magic.
There's no readme in the .tar.gz.  I have it on a usb, and extracted it to get the setup file in your command above.  I right-clicked in the folder, chose open in terminal and typed exactly what you put up there beginning with ./tru...  got this:&gt; bash: ./truecrypt-7.1a-setup-x64: Permission denied.
Straight up double clicking the file gives me a message about being unable to detect character encoding.
Thanks for your help, seriously, that first 3 lines was one of those perfect simple explanations that give me so much.

If that's how you see it and you never ever order for delivery, then cool.  But if you order food, then you're being a leech if you don't tip your driver.

If college didn't teach you to respect the people in your community who bring you your food, I'd say that's your problem.

So what's a noob to do?  If you don't mind humouring me further...  I'm basically planning to:  install linux on a laptop, go online to grab electrum and install that, unplug internet to said laptop forever, create cold storage wallet and use the USB stick method to get coins from the offline wallet into my hotter wallets.
Any insights into potential holes/fixes for this strategy would be greatly appreciated.

  I think given the sub-divisible nature of btcs, the market value is growing faster than inflation.  Isn't inflation a result of "money" being added to a system thereby devaluing the existing currency and inflating prices?  And so wouldn't inflation and currency grow together by default when you're using money that has no actual value and producing it flagrantly?  And wouldn't using a finite amount of infinitely divisible currency effectively negate inflation?  And wouldn't that be better (for most) than using someone else's currency that we can only borrow from them at interest?

Wow, a degree?  They're really just handing those out to anyone these days aren't they?  Well, if that's true then yes I am telling someone with a degree in computer science who was an early adopter of pgp that they need to learn something about private keys.  How was I supposed to know you had a degree in computer science anyways, if that's somhow your justification for the insult?  You certainly haven't shown you have a single firing synapse with your words, fucknuts.
Nobody broke into anything  The dude accidentally wire transferred, via video, his coins all over the world to anyone who would pick them up.  Nobody went into his house, nobody hacked into his bank account.  A guy simply assumed it was done by accident, knew he had to act fast before someone less well-intentioned scooped up the coins.
So feel free to keep hurling unjustified insults based on whatever leftfield information you somehow assume I know about you, but remember, you're still embarrassing yourself.

@_date: 2013-12-25 18:18:29
Obscure?  For now.  Complex?  Yes, but also transparent in it's complexity.  Fiat is extrememly simple once you get it, but its simplicity is extrememly obscurred by those that stand to gain from enslaving us with it, so I would argue that fiat, to the laymen is much more complex than bitcoin.  Nobody really understands that our entire money supply is costing us compound interest, payable only in compound interest-bearing new money created by private bankers.  As soon as they decide to stop printing new money, we will owe them our possessions and our labour.  Anything that undermines global domination by a powerful few is extremely necessary in my books, but I'm not the guy printing free cash and lending it out at interest.

This!  I think the $60 amt was too much incentive to figure out how to sell them, too much to lose for someone who isn't aware of the awesomeness.  I think, for a newb, an amount in the range of "not worth the pain in the ass of learning how to cash them out" is best: $5 give or take.  That way they'll have a bit of time to watch them double in value once or twice ;p and can decide from there.
As far as christmas presents for loved ones, if you got in early go big, don't hold expectations for what they do with them (otherwise it's not really a gift now is it?), and offer to buy them back if they just want to sell them.  And don't hold expectations for what people have to do with your gifts to them.   (general rant, not directed at anyone here...)

We do likely make a whole lot more than minimum wage on any given night because we usually get about 10%, maybe a little less, on average.


False, minimum wage applies to employees, which we are not.  We get the delivery charge, plus our tips minus the kitchen tip out.  We supply our own vehicle, and insurance, and we pay all the costs associated with running and maintaining a vehicle that is being driven for hours a day.
It sucks when it's dead, and it's awesome when it's busy.  Some places pay minimum wage and don't pay the delivery charge to their drivers.  I like the way we do it because I'm good at my job so on busy nights, the opportunity is there to make money if I stay on my game.  There's no babying this way, if I screw up and forget something I'm not making any money while I fix it.

Hm.  This is not what I wanted to hear good sir.  But I appreciate the warning.  Despite all my issues, I like the fact that BTC requires a lot of due diligence and personal responsibility.

My guess as of yesterday is that the chart will look something like the last big spike when it hit $260, that would leave it possibly dropping to $250ish CAD, before continuing along it's gradual upward journey.  But that's my stupid little amateur prediction.  The speed it's been increasing, I think is representative of the way a new idea infiltrates our lives.  Around the last spike, it was starting to show up in more mainstream media and then the whole Cypress thing blew up.  It was a tipping point for BTC in Europe and North America.  Now all the things mentioned sort of equates to the same sort of tipping point in China coupled with ATMs and more media hype here.  It's like a virus.  Once shit starts hitting mass media, awareness goes exponential.  Bitcoin?  People see it, check it out, see how epically awesome it is compared to anything else they know (exorbitant service fees, slavery), and they fuel demand.
