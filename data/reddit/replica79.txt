The prices are set every 14 days by bitmine. They are counting the price of btc and the difficulty and setzing you a price you cant barrely make profit of. Btc price is going to go up because of its halving in june. 99% sure you will not make a profit of mining, buy instead some btc and the 21btc computer, set up a node and drink a beer and wait :)

In dash nodes are coun mixer as dash is the old darkcoin. 
You dont need to reward nodes, because this works by it self. Marchants, btc holders etc. are keeping nodes by intrinsic reasons. 
This question is old as old the bitcoin is....
