That's just wrong. It lets you change the address.

You do understand this is a service charge right? It's to protect themselves from volatility. Because after you make the exchange, they go on gdax ans complete it. That's why there are no order types on coinbase. It's not an exchange. It's a service

Try this. It prioritizes your transaction for no charge.

This is totally wrong. The whole point of bitcoin IN THE WHITE PAPER is for peer to peer digital cash. If no one spends its not truly a currency. This flies in the face of Satoshis vision.

It seems to me that bitcoin cash is going to try to pump which will steal marketcap / price from bitcoin. Id expect a medium sized dip like we saw last time. Wait for that

I 100% agree that BTC is the real chain and not BCH, that being said BCH has already forked off and is its own entity and although some of the same people supporting that are supporting 2x, this does not mean this is a continuation of a fight between bch and btc. I think that argument is completely fallacious.

That's because as much as you or I don't want to admit it, this sub is extremely hostile to contrary opinions.  I'm sure there are some people who get down voted to oblivion.

Out of curiosity, where does either side get the impression that the majority of users support SegwitNox or Segwit2x. The vast majority of speculators and holders, have literally no idea what's going on. As far as I can tell support for each side comes from either r/bitcoin or the other subreddit which I will not name here. It seems to me this is just a power struggle between miners, and a company heavily involved in the bitcoin community and not much more. Each respective subreddit serves as an echo chamber, but can anyone point me to cold hard facts or statistics to back up their claims?
