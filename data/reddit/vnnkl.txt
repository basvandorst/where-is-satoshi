they use BIP44,
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
so they derive their addresses from your master seed using a path, like this:
first address on first account
m / 44' / 0' / 0' / 0 / 0
first address on second account
m / 44' / 0' / 1' / 0 / 0
You back up m, so they can recreate the accounts that you use in a trackable way.
m / 44' / 0' / 2' / 0 / 0
m / 44' / 0' / 3' / 0 / 0 etc.

Mycelium Wallet for iOS (1.5) does not support BIP38 encrypted private keys, but requires WIF format.
One workaround is to use an offline copy of bitaddress.org, decode it using Wallet details, **private key WIF compressed** can be used.

Depends whether you chose it to be resettable, if so you can wait for 1 week and set a new one afterwards (this is when you lose your phone that you have a buffer of 1 week to empty your account)
If not, then you can use your 12 word backup to restore your wallet and set a new PIN on this one

just recently went through most of satoshis post again, learned a new thing I didn't know before and not sure if its still valid, since we are a lil further down the road since v0.3:
- Do new issued bitcoins from generated blocks still have to mature 120 blocks until they can be spend? 
(Purpose of this is that a new mined block could still end up being orphaned since a different block could be found at the same time which could end up being the longer chain)
- Do miners still reject a transaction if they received one with the same inputs before? This would allow attempts to double spend be broadcasted only slightly after the original one to maintain a chance to be successful.
(considering transaction malleability, can an later transaction with with a different txid but an higher fee be chosen by miners who have seen the original one before?)
- In case we would experience a fork of the blockchain, if I build a transaction and propagate it, will it be seen my miners working on each fork, so that they include it in their transaction pool and hopefully in an block or would I have to create two valid transactions? (What would have to differ in the forks so miners of one chain start rejecting it)
- Am I right that wallets only save private keys and derive the public key from it? (I've read in a paper that they would hold both, which is different from what i thought until now or is it up to devs and how they save their wallets)
edit: it depends on the developer, they use different formats. Although just saving the private key would be sufficient, since the public key can be derived from it, many choose to save a keypair.
- are still 200kb of each block reserved for transactions with no fee (which are included based on priority)?

You can set a bounty on any transaction, once you've done it, the transaction will be available here 
If there is no bounty for a transaction you will see {} otherwise the transaction will be listed there.
A transaction listed still has no fee, but they will get the bounty from conferment which is enough to make up for the missing fee.
Miners or mining pools can listen to that bounty page and once a transaction pops up there, they just include it like any other and get 2/3 of the bounty as far as i know, 1/3 is for confirm next or shared with referral.
does that answer your question?

Yes, mining will be more efficient, but imagine some manufacturer in china producing new top miners, but uses them before shipping out, than you could have a higher difficulty than hashing power. But generally it should "only" cripple us for 2016blocks (&gt;2 weeks, depending how much the deficit)

if he has 10 btc on his gox accounts and makes an withdrawl for 5 btc and the transaction gets mutated. you will have one transaction in the blockchain for 5 btc with a different txid.
mt gox won't see the original one and reimburse 5 btc. Pay out 10 btc then. than you have different amounts on these transactions.

Ok, I've been with Purse.io for a while now, heres my experience:
I've completed 5 trades, everything arrived and no one knocked on my door yet.
Regarding scammers etc, yes I've seen some that did look suspicious (using the same namepattern and communication), I've contacted purse.io &amp; amazon prior to accepting the goods.
purse.io said that it could be people using multiple accounts to circumvent their only one purchase at a time for beginners.
 
I asked Amazon what would happen if a payment would end up fraudulent, they said since a wishlist is being used they will approach the buyer and and not the receiver of the goods. 
Introduced two of my friends and together we make up about 2/3 of the offers of our non-us country, what we noticed:
You will get new accounts buying and the order will just be fine, but after that they can do multiple purchases and end up taking a lot of offers, preferably the ones with the most btc (regardless of cheaper ones with less volume). It seems that it works one time but then amazon catches on, although they mark the transaction as paid the item will still sit in your wishlist and not disappear because he hasn't finished the payment process.
These are the buyers keeping your btc in escrow for a while (1 week) until support resolves the dispute you should open.
edit: 
So what you wanna look out for: 
Buyers with a single or no rating, if they take your orders: check your transaction and look on your wishlist the item was on, if its still sitting there, open dispute saying so.
heres my chat with amazon, non english:

04:44 PM CEST Inga(Amazon): *Die Wunschliste ist in diesem Fall ihre, aber der Käufer ist nicht mit Ihnen identisch, sodass wir über die Transaktion an der Käufer und nicht an den Empfänger herantreten.* 
(**You own the wishlist, but are not identical with the buyer, thats why we will approach the buyer and not the recipient**)
04:45 PM CEST me: Dabei handelt es sich ja dann aber in dem Fall um Täter bzw. auch ein Opfer?

(**You'd be the victim. We approach the buyer because thats where cash flew, not recipient or owner of the wishlist** )
04:46 PM CEST me: also soll ich mir trotz dieser auffälligkeit keine Gedanken machen?

short story time:
germany, it is for 88€ to be precise, the problem is:
there was a guy selling the method to turn stolen CCs into bitcoin on an underground forum.
As a proof of concept he uploaded a screenshot of the order confirmation and scratched out my name, but not the order nr.
apparently an undercover cop hawking that site saw it and the SOKO CyberCrime in bavaria started approaching amazon with a warrant, which in turn gave them the tracking details since it wasn't delivered.
so they went to DHL to get the delivery guy to make an arrest upon delivery (wtf?)
they reached him but he had given the package to my mom 15 min earlier (thank god, lucky me)
they let him come in same day to make a witness statement and contacted the woman which credit card was used and asked her to press charges so they can get that high profile CC scammer.
some time after that i got a hearing notice (september) and today this.
tl;dr: Apparently im big in the CC scamming scene, its just that im not, im just his proof of concept.

no, it was some time back, good times.
instawallet was a service that would create an online adress to hold your funds by using an unique id like instawallet.org/bdbf-jfg345-jtgh5
you would simply save the url and have easy access to the bitcoin address connected to it. 
problem was, turned out not to be really working great. You could google site:instawallet.org and google would spit out all instawallets site indexed, including some of these unique pages which you could then sweep.
Later they were hacked and you could claim losses only for addresses with more than 50 btc in them i think.

They don't.
You set your passphrase yourself and calculate an Intermediate Code, you provide this Intermediate Code to the company. 
They generate a pair of keys for you using this Code. The result will be an encrypted privatekey (starting with an 6) and the corresponding public key. The passphrase for said private-key is your passphrase.
So by using an Intermediate Code you can have someone else create an Bitcoin Adress for you and still be sure he never had access to the unencrypted private key

the combined hash power of the bitcoin network declined during the last 2016 blocks (2 weeks) so that to make sure that transactions are executed at the aimed rate of 10 minutes, the difficulty had to be reduced by -1.16%.
Which has not happened often, increases from +10-44% is what it has usually been, when mining was catching up.

"my 5btc transcation never arrived"

@_date: 2014-09-08 10:55:45
they are sold at a premium i assume, i sell on lbc for a premium as well, taking between 5-9%. But i replenish the bitcoins i sell off, sometimes i wait a little but more often than not i buy back in less than 2 days. 
this premium allows me to buy at whatever price still gives me a profit, so i don't mind nibbling at bigger sell walls. So the price might just move less due to the intermediary taking a profit. but you are talking about bigger purchases, beyond 50BTC don't you? i never go over 15k€ per transaction.

I always recommend GreenAddress.it or mycellium,
GreebAddress makes it easier for beginners, since its an deterministic wallet and saving the mnemonic will also contain all future generated addresses. I advise them to put the unencrypted mnemonic somewhere safe and use an encrypted mnemonic so they can log back in using their password of choice, if they forget their pin. it offers also many 2fa options. available on ios and android
mycellium makes it easy for them to create a paper wallet for cold storage. available on android only
let them have a look at greenaddress, explain nlocktime and have them verify their email.

when the hashrate decreases it is easier to reach these 51%, but consider what power an 51% attack gives you:
"An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
* Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
The attacker can't:
* Reverse other people's transactions
* Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
* Change the number of coins generated per block
* Create coins out of thin air
* Send coins that never belonged to him"
If all coins are mined, you lose a massive incentive of launching an 51% attack, since effectively you can pause the confirmation of transactions, but these are your solely income in this scenario (selfish-mining will also bring you just transaction fees, so you are likely to include as many transactions as you can).
@_date: 2014-05-12 11:34:18
why is it unsustainable?
new asics are about to arrive, this will increase difficulty further and make more miners stop mining btc.
Probably they are going to pick up the most profitable altcoin there is, mine them at a multipool and sell the altcoins for btc. If a good chunk of miner would do this, this would create a buying pressure on btc. So the price would go up and not down. and if the costs to mine increase, other buy btc instead of mining. So I'm not sure I agree with you on this one.
the transaction costs are still fine imo, you don't need to set an fee for an transaction to go through. although i'd like the standard fee being set lower or being dynamic to size of transcation.
@_date: 2014-05-12 12:08:38

selling at a premium for cash (mine is 9,5% for local, if we do it without lbc usually 6%) and buying back in using that cash.
if you have 3 btc now you could serve an offer up to 1500$/1200€ and then buy back in making a profit of 90$/72€ ( w/o lbc, premium 6%).
What you have to consider though is taxes and the rules where you live at, im in germany, i can sell btc i've had for over a year and not pay tax on gains. i'm just selling all my btc which are older than a year and buy back in, been doing this for a little over a year now, so i have a certain amount of  taxfree btc i can sell every week or two. 
By buying back in i always purchase more than i sold and thus increase the btc i will be able to sell in a year from now. it just grows over time if you are patient (an lowers your costs per coin). i buy at bitcoin.de, where you don't have to send funds to the exchange first but buy them and send the money straight to the seller, so you can just make a cash deposit in your account and buy online with little time in-between selling and buying back in.
but it certainly depends where you live, wouldn't recommend for us residents.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:38:28
just that it doesn't has a cap is enough for me personally. i don't think you need inflation to be functioning, if a product offers good value for its price i'll probably buy it no matter if inflation/deflation. if i don't need it, i shouldn't be buying it so my purchasing power doesn't decrease.




it will take until 2140 until all btc are issued so i hope i doesn't take that long til we see several dollar fees (i used a 10$ txfee already). Not sure if i know what you mean regarding no competition, a single mining pool taken over? Transactions would still go i think since there is reserved part in each block filled up with free transactions. fees would be based on whether you need the transaction done in a timely fashion or not.
and setting fees to zero would probably just result in getting way more transactions relayed to your note, which would probably more than you can fit into the block (whatever the size might be at that time). And the only thing to drive the competition out is still finding the blocks.

then you could just use your debit card, if you are able to pay in full anyway. to us europeans credit cards are for debt, or the intention to stretch out a bigger purchase over some time, like financing stuff that doesn't offer it usually.

I got excited aswell, since it has 61 BTC on it.
If you are trying to unswirl it, *no need to start*:
You can see that the private key starts with an **6**, meaning it is an **encrypted privatekey** and you will need the passphrase to access it. 
If it started with a **5** you'd be good to go.
OP you will not be able to access the BTC either if you don't know the passphrase, so you probably will have to contact him/be contacted by him anyway.

@_date: 2014-07-16 10:52:01
they use affiliate marketing, so they'll get 5% of purchase value at amazon (altough they sell more than 10.000 items/month, so they might be up to 10%) for example and will just give 2/3 or 3/4 of that back to you.
Do that for all kind of merchants and you will have returning customers netting you money everytime they shop.

if you are outside of the us look into doing arbitrage by selling on localbitcoins. you'll earn some btc while helping adoption at the same time.
you don't need to many btc to start and it adds up, netted me about 16 btc since im doing it (started august 2013).
@_date: 2014-12-16 01:04:17
you have not attached a fee, that might be a reason it can take longer. 
looking for your transaction on
 by copying your hash into the search field (d306170c48caa150e61fc0fedf98b594294a59e3343c47773ce481a80f973036) it doesn't show up, so its not like all the bitcoin nodes really know about your transaction (or are telling each other about it), maybe because of your missing fee it wasn't relayed in the beginning.
you might want to try confirmnext.com and set a bounty on your transaction id (d306170c48caa150e61fc0fedf98b594294a59e3343c47773ce481a80f973036) to make sure it gets included by some miner.
good luck
edit: well it went through now
@_date: 2014-12-31 11:10:25
have you been through that already? because i've always wondered if your btc have to sit in a single address for a year or if being able to sign a chain  of addresses in your control would be sufficient, if the coins haven't left any of your addresses for that time.

"An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
* Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
The attacker can't:
* Reverse other people's transactions
* Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
* Change the number of coins generated per block
* Create coins out of thin air
* Send coins that never belonged to him"

stay with items shipped by amazon though, if something goes bad, you are not as likely end up in trouble. im speaking from experience :)
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:33:06
i can see that, hence my question if you've used it.


nope, you pick an offer, accept it and will be redirected to the wishlist, add items to cart, check out, pay, done.
its actually explained quite easy 
and you're buying overpriced anyway, so if you can't stand a week of btc movement, purse is probably the wrong place to buy anyway

otherwise  on irc is place aswell.
@_date: 2014-07-16 10:44:22
yes, but it has quite less volume. sometimes only 5 or less offers in total. And "only" offers up to -20%, but at all sites therefore, watch out for the shipping address though.
so far only had 2 trades there, one pretending to have bought and trying to talk me into releasing btc earlier and one that did send a receipt but changed the receivers name to his, so that might not even arrive.
I do prefer the system in place at purse.io though over brawker since you know what you get ordering at amazon.

they take the biggest offers there are even if its a worse rate. and wait for you to confirm receival of goods and then just take the bitcoins, which are 3/4 of purchase value. a good steal

you already have a lot of choices, I've used (and still use) localbitcoin, blockchain.info, paper wallets, and mycelium. 
Make sure you have easy backups, to do this I'd recommend to either try out mycelium or Greenaddress.it, I've started recently to give it a shot and I'm surprised they went under the radar this long.
So maybe go with Greenaddress.it, since you will only need the initial backup and all addresses you create afterwards are still saved, also little sensitive information is kept on your device. 
If  it seems to technical start with mycelium and get comfortable with Greenaddress later. (read up on nLock Transactions before, but i think the features it offers are the way bitcoin was meant to be used e.g. using a new address for every transaction is an important one in my opinion)

Not sure what you mean with block are released in 50's, I think you mean the block reward for the miner.
The block reward started with 50 and halves every four years, so it is 25 right now and will go down to 12,5 in 2017.
The miner reward themselves, they include as many transactions as they want/can into an block, but the very first transaction is the block reward, which goes to an adress of their choosing.
So the first transaction from a block mined by a pool will likely go to an adressed owned by the mining pool. 
so every block introduces 25 btc atm with every new mined block in their first transaction (check the last mined block, first transaction should be over 25btc (25 BTC Blockreward + x earned in Fees by the miner

It probably is the security setting your ramen shop has picked in bitpay, which probably requires 6 confirmations. They should change their setting, since requiring 6 confirmations is like waiting 180 days when someone pays with credit card.
You could aswell have shown her the confirmations on your phone, since even when you only have 2 confirmations, the chance that the block your transaction was included in (the block before) would be orphaned is quite low.
About gox: I don't care much about them either, the longer you are into bitcoin the higher the chance you suffered under some action by mtgox. If people want to avoid this they shouldn't go blindly to the first marketplace without reading up on it, or maybe just use localbitcoins, fast and quite easy for beginners.
@_date: 2017-02-07 10:47:43
You are using iOS, correct?
There is an issue where max amount selects only one of your two UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs stemming from your two transactions).
You should be able to resolve it by copying your next receive address and send max to it, then once more. It will first select the 18$ and then the other utxo. 
We are aware of this issue, which seems to be a corner case and are working on a fix. Sorry for any issue you might experience due to this.

use a different block explorer that displays the fee, 44 sat/byte is too low,  give 35-1200 minute estimate assuming no transactions pay more than your fee at this moment.
edit: is 19PXNzA4KXcEXW4kSch9PWVd9VcE6ow12U your change? it is used, so you can not make a high priority transaction to make yours attractive enough, it was used 26sat/byte tx, so the problem got bigger.

Yes, the idea would be that it is mineable by everyone and mining would be incentivized by issuing fedcoin.
Changes to the procotol would be managed by the fed. I've asked him what would happen when you are unhappy with v1.1 of fed coin, if you could stay on 1.0 or it would invalidate your coins. He said it would probably be like a hard fork.
I've asked him if he'd like to to do an AMA (and explained AMA to him).
We both agreed ask me anything wouldn't isn't a good idea if you are working for the fed, but he would be up for ask me anything about fedcoin.

once excitement kicks in you often find yourself going over (the same) charts all the time, you lose the view for perspective since your environment seems all btc. (it isn't at all)
it can help to just change the interval to 6 months to realize these 2 weeks you are looking at is part of a big picture and until one of the factors for these network effects isn't broken you are probably still going to be fine.
that's what helped me looking at charts when the price corrected.

used it several times, experience wasn't that bad, aftermath is.
got 2 charges (fraud and computer fraud) because someone used an stolen amazon account to purchase the goods.
If you are going to give it a shot, do not use items that are shipped by a 3rd party merchant, amazon doesn't give a damn about cc fraud, since they've calculated the risks within, but small merchants do.
make sure the item is being removed from your wishlist, if its not, be cautious.

14Kz is likely your change address and the funds you sent to 1GDJ have been aggregated by the service in this transaction with other funds 
As you did not use any of your change it is unspent whereas the output you've created at 1GDJ was spent by the dnm when they aggregated. 
You should be credited the amount you've sent there, as 1GDJ is connected to your account there.

Not sure whether you got it resolved, 
but already used addresses are not synced with every sync, at least every 24hrs though.
So tapping the balance or hitting refresh is a normal sync, with a chance of 30% it will switch to a different mycelium server when you do refresh and also do a full sync rather than a normal sync (which is the same like reloading account then). 
So if you miss a transaction to an already used address that should be there and it happened less than 24hrs ago, reloading account is likely the way to fix it.

I guess you are referring to simplex,
if your card goes through smoothly it can be completed in hours.
If you are verified manually the process of verification can take up to 24hrs, after which your coins should show up.
If not give support your simplex id.
Please note that the fees are 5% by mycelium and simplex each.
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:12:12
The wallet in screenshot is over 2 years old (pre-July 2015)
"They recently added a "buy with credit card" feature that charges nearly 20%"
- it's 5% by mycelium and simplex each, simplex takes a minimum of 10$, so if you only buy 50USD you get rekt.
"They also seem to be in favor of BU, which I personally think is a bad sign, but others may view differently."
- Not a single dev is

You probably had an version that used a different derivation path for the keys, so the seed generated different addresses and showing a different balance, here is a list of derivation paths used by different wallets:
You can use this tool (offline) and put your 12 word seed in there, select the tab BIP32 and set the derivation path to "m" and see if it generates the same addresses like your electrum.  
If so, and you started it on an online computer you can fetch the addresses balance by pressing the button on the right of derived addresses.
Or you can use the (extended) xpub at  to check your balance for example.
If you have another working wallet where you can send the balance to, another tool you can use is 
Pass the BIP32 Extended key from the previous tool in there (below the derivation path you set), 
set the receivers address, 
and the amount - 0.001 for fee (which should be enough, if you did not mine or have a lot of inputs for any other reason). 
Click generate transaction, then double check the resulting transaction! (the second tool is still in development)
Hope this helps
@_date: 2016-09-19 09:28:22
If you have the seed,
reinstall the app, it will delete your apps data. Upon starting it will ask you to restore or start a new wallet. 
Make a new one.
Make backup of your new wallet, double check it.
Then go to the menu and select Cold Storage, choose Masterseed and type in your old wallets seed.
It should find the balance, send it to your new wallet by selecting the account from My Addresses (in Address Book).
Hope this helps

no, they don't make you anonymous. 
when visualized reusing 
addresses have funds flowing back into the same address over and over again, whereas by using new addresses everytime it is more like scraping off some of the top.
Coin tumblers and dark wallets are trying to do coinshuffe or conjoin for example, where the inputs for your transactions are packed with other peoples inputs and put into one large transaction, so no one can certainly tell that your output belongs to a certain input.

i just know the iOS App, which lets you set up a cold storage with two  iOS devices. One being the cold one and can't be launched unless it has no connection to wifi and the hot one with which you create transactions.
 These are displayed as QR codes and using your cold wallet (device) you scan them, sign them and have the signed transaction display as a qr code.
All you need to do is scan the transaction using your hot wallet and broadcast it.

bitcoin doesn't get mentioned that often from skipping through.
searched for it and gave it a shot a tl;dr
Page 13
"Der Themenkomplex „Bare versus unbare Zahlungsinstrumente“ wurde dagegen ausführlicher behandelt, um noch detaillierter herauszuarbeiten, warum die Befragten Bargeld oder unbare Zahlungsinstrumente präferieren. Auch wurde beispielsweise ein kleiner Fragen- block zu virtuellen Währungen wie Bitcoins aufgenommen."
A small block of the questionnare was dedicated to virtual currencies such as bitcoin.
Page 23
"Virtuelle Währungen am Beispiel Bitcoin
Bei Bitcoin handelt es sich um das prominenteste Beispiel einer virtuellen Währung. Dabei bezeichnet der Begriff Bitcoin sowohl die entsprechenden Einheiten als auch das Zahlungssystem. Zu unterscheiden ist zwischen der Zahlungs- und der Wert- aufbewahrungsfunktion von virtuellen Währungen. Das Bitcoin-Zahlungssystem ermöglicht die weltweite Übertragung von Bitcoin-Einheiten innerhalb kurzer Zeit. In der Vergangenheit war Bitcoin vor allem wegen des z. T. sehr stark schwanken- den Kurses, aber auch wegen diverser Diebstähle bei Online-Verwahrern der Bit- coin-Einheiten im Fokus der Presse. Neben Bitcoin gibt es noch weitere virtuelle Währungen, die jedoch bisher kaum Bedeutung haben.
Die Ausgabemenge von Bitcoins ist grundsätzlich beschränkt auf 21 Millionen Ein- heiten. Derzeit sind knapp 14 Millionen ausgegeben. Die Nutzung dieser Einheiten als Zahlungsmittel ist jedoch noch sehr gering: Tagtäglich werden nur ungefähr 80.000 bis 105.000 Transaktionen12 weltweit mit Bitcoin durchgeführt. Zum Ver- gleich: Arbeitstäglich werden allein in Deutschland gut 25 Millionen Überweisun- gen ausgeführt.13 Die Zahlen veranschaulichen, dass es sich bei Bitcoin bisher um ein Nischenphänomen handelt.
Lediglich 28 % der Teilnehmer an der Befragung gaben an, Bitcoin zu kennen. Den höchsten Bekanntheitsgrad hat Bitcoin bei den 18- bis 24-Jährigen, von denen immerhin 41 % bereits von Bitcoin gehört haben. Entsprechend gering sind auch die Nutzungszahlen der virtuellen Währung: Lediglich 2 % derjenigen Befragten, die Bitcoin kennen, besitzen auch welche, 6 % von ihnen planen den Kauf bzw. die Nutzung. Dieser kleinen Anzahl an Personen stehen 84 % der Befragten gegenüber, die derzeit nicht vorhaben, Einheiten der Währung zu kaufen oder zu nutzen.14"
Bitcoin is the most prominent example for virtual currencies (digital =/= virtual ). Bitcoin stands for the payment system aswell as the unit of account (nope, Bitcoin = payment system, bitcoin = currency). In the past it was known due to its volatility, but also for thefts which occurred at "online keepers" of the virtual currency (exchanges). They are capped at 21 million, 14 million have been issued so far. Use as a currency still low, daily transactions vary between 80k-105k. 28% of people questioned said they knew about Bitcoin. most known to people aged 18-24 years where 41% were aware of Bitcoin.
2% of those who know bitcoin also own some. 6% plan their buy or usage of coin. 84% of those questioned are not planning or buying bitcoin at this moment.

because introducing people new to btc to the concept of brainwallets doesn't mix well. They tend to think they could come up with a phrase no one will think of and so be able to easily secure their bitcoin. In practice they lose their coins to someone feeding their machine dictionaries and a lot of text books and generally popular quotes and phrases.
it is just better to not encourage them to use brainwallets and instead have them setup a mnemonic. Painting a book with pictures of each word and putting it in your book shelf would still be a better idea.

They both use a secret and derive their addresses from it, but they do use different derivation paths:
* mycelium uses m/44'/0'/0'/0
* whereas Electrum seems to use m/0/0
You could use 
(this version allows **passing an xpub into the BIP32 Root Key Field** and use update)
Download it and either put in your 12 words or export your xpriv, choose the **BIP32 tab** and put in the right path, check if the addresses match. 
"It uses m/0/&lt;n&gt; for receiving addresses, and m/1/&lt;n&gt; for change addresses."

oh wow,
weird by it was not a vacation and labeling as such is misleading imo, it was a meetup of all wallet employees developers + some management.
What the company paid for was the accommodation ( accommodating 10 persons) for 6 days and the flight, that's it. Mine personally was 0.326 BTC (217,70USD) at that time (Germany to Spain). 
The rental car and stuff was on our own, same for food.
&lt;5 BTC paid for having devs from Canada/Chile/Austria/Germany see each other face to face for the first time (I was with mycelium for a year by that time and had not seen any of you in video)
I get that you did code more than most of the other devs, but you were also working on shufflepuff and the others were wallet team with the goal to get sync on the road lying ahead.
It is wrong to name it a vacation on company expenses, as its whole purpose was work related.
@_date: 2018-12-16 07:02:07
they spent money on flights and an airbnb so the team or people could see each other face to face, some for the first time.
the airbnb was  we were there for 6 days, so we are talking about 1800$ accommodation plus flights.

in theory that could happen, but its up to the miner to decide if he wants to include an transaction, it could also decide to include transactions that come with a minerfee of at least 0.0001 btc.
if all miner did this the consequence would be that a transaction would either stay in limbo until overwritten by a transaction with an fee thats executed.
its not just up to the miner, listening nodes (just syncing blockchain and passing incoming transactions to other nodes) could also decide to pass on transactions with an minerfee.
there are also blocks in the blockchain which dont have any transactions included (they only have one - the blockreward to the miner) because they were either found before they received a transaction or because they decided to not include any to get to a valid solution quicker.

1) its accurate
2) yes, the last bitcoins will be mined approx. 2140. after that bitcoin should have grown enough that the fees attached to the transactions should be enough incentive for the miners to mine.

I really liked Julian Schneiders comments on taxes,
for germans:
if you do arbitrage on an exchange you don't have to pay taxes on your purchases.
