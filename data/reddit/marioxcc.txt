No, but if you remember characteristics of the password it's relatively easy to write a program to brute force through the remaining possibilities. The more you remember, the less passwords you will have to test. If you remember very little then it may not be even worth trying (Just as like it's not worth trying to brute-force crack an address).
Even if you don't know computer programming you can hire someone to write such a program.
Good luck!.

You would have to get more than half of the *hashing power* (Not nodes) to agree to not to include such a transactions in their blocks and to not to accept any block including it.
It's technically possible, but by reasons expressed it's extremely unlikely you get miners to cooperate.

You don't need bitcoins to mine, you need mining hardware to mine. You're asking for donations but I see no reason to donate to you.
It's a pity that people were affected by a criminal pool owner. However, it's people which chosed to trust that pool operator, to take that rist, even having the option to avoid this kind of theft by mining in P2Pool. Furthermore, it stands to reason that if you keep "tons of BTC" as credit from a pool then you risk to lose "tons of BTC" as well. I feel sorry for you but I feel no sympathy.

Well, if by "criminal" you mean somebody which did something illegal then there is a problem with that. There is good people which deserve trust and may be not law-abiding, like rebels, and bad people which don't deserve trust but are law-abiding, like some lawyers.

40 BTC are worth the same no matter how you earned them. Spend them just as you would if you worked hard to earn them.
By the way, we get these questions about mining daily there. Don't you know how to use a search engine?.
@_date: 2013-10-28 03:28:22
I think other replies explained it but IMO it can be explained clearer:
A market order is executed immediately at the lowest possible price. The engine goes through the asks (If it's a buy market order) or bids (If it's a sell market order) from innermost to outermost matching them to the just arrived market order until it's completely filled or there are no more bids or asks left.
A limit order is performed the same way with the exception that there is a limit to the maximum (If it's a buy order) or minimum (If it's a sell order) on which it can be executed. Once no more previously existing bids or asks can be matched against it then the new limit order is placed in the order book (Unless it has been completely filled). At least that's the straightforward way to do it (I.e: to serve orders on a first-come first-served basis).
However, as far as I know, exchanges may implement a different matching algorithm like adding new orders to a queue rather than an order book and periodically process the queue by computing the price which gives the greatest amount of volume and executing all bids at that price or lower and asks at that price or lower. Remaining orders would then be added to the order book. I know of no exchange which does this but I don't know a lot about finances anyway. This is just what I have learned as someone interested in finances.
Also check out  for examples of the operation of a first-come first-served matching algorithm.
Hope it helps.

I'd say than there are two board classification of people according to their opinion on Bitcoin: Those who really understand what it is and value it for the clever technical details and it's usefulness for society; and those who are very prone to logical flaws in their thinking and let themselves be guided by the mainstream media and shallow reasoning. By what you're saying it seems that your parents belong to the later. That's really a pity. At least you can feel proud of being more mature than them (At least in this point).
You probably know that there are exchanges like MtGox, Bitstamp, BTC-e, etc... They work with a continuous auction method and have a higher liquidity than what you will find in an over the counter market like LocalBitcoins. However, to get fiat currency in and out they require you associate a bank account and prove you're the owner of it. That's probably not something you can do by yourself and your parents are likely to dislike the idea (Through, isn't any different that paying with credit card as for a security viewpoint).
LocalBitcoins and [Bitcoin-OTC]( are over the counter market. LocalBitcoins is much more popular so I'd recommend it. Please note that you don't need to physically meet with a counterpart. Several seller/buyers accept online payment methods like bank wire. I'd recommend that method if you want to exchange your bitcoins for fiat currency.
Also please note that reputable in-person bitcoin traders not only choose but **require** busy places to meetup for the exchange. Just as you (Or your parents) are affraid of a theft by them they're afraid of a theft by you. But again, most traders accept online payment methods.


Unfortunately your dad seems to not to have the tiniest clue of finances and economics. Bitcoin is real currency. It has both digital and [physical]( representations; just like the fiat currency your parents use everyday. What do your dad think money in their bank accounts is?. It's just an entry in a bank's database. So are Bitcoins, but Bitcoin has an edge here because **you** are in control of your Bitcoins. Nobody can freeze or seize your Bitcoins while massive legitimate bank account freezings have ocurrent (Search for the Cyprus case). Another thing that makes Bitcoin "more real" than the fiat currency your parents use is that it's limited in supply.  There won't be any more than 21M Bitcoins by design, ever, and that's enforced by the network. There is no central entity to print more of them as will (Like central banks) which is a major reason for inflation.  In extreme cases they print so much more money than the existing money is literarily not even worth the paper it's printed on (Search for hyperinflation). Bitcoin is immune to that.


What don't she likes about that?.  The fact that there are drug markets for Bitcoin?.  Let's go, there are drug markets in every currency you may think of.  That may be a good or bad thing for you depending on your viewpoint but to stigmatize Bitcoin because of it is stupid. Do she stigmatizes her national currency because of the drug trades it's used for?.
Hope it helps.

Transactions are unrelated to the attack described in the post. By the way, this kind of attack has been around for as long as networking existed AFAIK but they're impractical to perform on a PtP network like Bitcoin's.

The value is driven by too many factors to account. Whether a store offers goods for a fixed ammount of money in a given currency don't makes the value more stable or keep one "grounded" as for it value. Use a inflation index for that and go study economics before talking bullshit.

You mean "Hypothetical". Despite the common misconception, the fact that something is a theory don't means that it's just a supposition, rather a theory is in few words a system of knowledge that explains or describes a part of nature or an abstraction (Like graph theory).

What fuZZe said is not an instance of the Gambler fallacy. Some horses may be better than others (And who is better may be educatedly guessed about by studying previous performance and other characteristics) while roulettes are all equal neglecting balancing.
The example you mentioned is indeed an instance of the gambler's fallacy as far as I know. By the way, in case you care my advice would be: Don't loose time arguing fallacies to people if you can avoid it with no loss for you, just mention them that they can use their favorite search engine on "Gambler Fallacy". They will learn if they want to, and otherwise you won't waste time.

What they did was illegal, but don't lump together illegal with immoral. That's as much as taking law as a moral standard which is ridiculous. Whether SR was immoral was a different issue. If you're of that viewpoint then please use the correct word.

I'm very sorry to read that. In short: You can hardly do anything. You better spend your time trying to earn more money than to trying to get back what you lost. I'm not pleased to tell you so, but that's the best of my knowledge, and deluding you into thinking you can recover them and make you lose precious time would be worse.
I assume that the bitcoins have already been transferred to an address not under your control. If that's not the case (I.e: You lost the key or something like that) please let us know.
Also please note that if anything, you suffered a crack, not a hack. To hack means to solve in a way depending on the context (Sometimes ingeniously, sometimes dirty). You're claiming that the _wallet_ was cracked but is there any evidence of that?. If you know there is a vulnerability in the Bitcoin software please report it ASAP, but more likely it was other piece of software which was compromised or just plain old human error. Remember, the human is almost always the weakest like. If you gave physical access to your computer and the wallet was unencrypted (Or, the key was not generated securely, etc...) then it's likely than the bitcoins were stolen that way.
There is nothing you can do on the technical side. You can attempt to track the coins by using taint, but that's very unreliable and albeit you may _ask_ people to stop accepting the stolen coins from you (Like some redditors are suggesting for the SR seized BTC) they are very very unlikely to do so because that would be in detriment of the foundations of Bitcoin (Specifically, the fungibility of them) and because it was your mistake to not to take proper measures to secure your wealth.

"If the charges are correct, he does not deserve that money. But the Bitcoin community does." &lt;- Why?. Why do they (Or us) _deserve_ a share of a seizure we had nothing to do about?. And what's the "Bitcoin community", exactly?. Anyone that has bitcoins?. That includes the FBI. No way. This is pointless. Do they want also want seized dollars to be released to the "dollar community"?.

It depends on difficulty and also on luck. Mining is a stochastic process. Pools reduce the uncertainty related to the process of hashing itself and futures contracts like the ones traded ad  can be used to hedge against difficulty changes.
