47% of the worlds population in 1929 worked in agriculture &amp; knew how to grow food. And even then 7% of the worlds population starved. Now the figure is closer to 2% of western populations working in agriculture. While farms are some of the riskiest businesses held as collateral on a bank's books once government subsidies are not accounted for. Subsidies mind you that are either funded by the selling of government debt in a bond crisis or tit for tat tariffs in a global trade war that pushes the world onto a defacto unleverageable sound money standard via the weaponization of nation fiat currencies. Notwithstanding how crucial the massively overleveraged energy sector is with it's inextricable importance to food production &amp; dependence on debt creation.

I spend a bit of time pondering why this is a thing &amp; so far came to a few conclusions that fed into other factors that are self evident across the broader market that are backed up more by network laws than just economics. For one [Zipf's law]( appears to allude to why Bitcoin leads the broader crypto market as the 'coin to rule them all'. It's basically the first, most simple &amp; powerful proof of concept, that has enough functional recognition &amp; investment by all invested parties to it's readily accessible &amp; permissionless network. This goes a way to explain why Bitcoin won't just get 'MySpaced' or 'Nokia'd' off centre stage. That said Zipf's law (which is just a zoomed in study of Pareto Distribution) show's how a functional, adequate, less than perfect, yet invested into 'thing' can invoke value when exibited or presented for purpose.

Great to hear an Argentine citizen's views on this matter. I can only imagine their must be a lot of uncertainty during this time of transition. I hope you are doing ok. Can I ask; Are you suggesting it could go higher than 14.9? Because in my mind, the minute capital controls are lifted anyone holding a large amount of wealth in the peso, will want to move into something more secure like USD or even CNH considering the trade links Argentina now has with China. I can imagine the effect of this wealth moving into other currencies could easily drive the peso exchange rate much higher than the current unofficial rate if this scenario played out. Moreover, this special tax you mentioned; Is it applied as a part of the existing capital control disincentives that Macri is promising to abolish on, or soon after the 10th of December? Thanks.
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:30:28
Yes, a similar article arguing Bitcoin is following Moore's law was published by Business Insider: 
I think that because of the Bitcoin network's essential tokenisation of the Bitcoins themselves via the block reward &amp; fee system built within the protocol, acting as the incentives to maintain network security via proof of work, thus the network's infrastructure growth &amp; maintenance costs infuse an intrinsic floor cost in their creation; not unlike the energy costs to mine gold. Furthermore this tokenisation also lends itself as a form of money foremost, &amp; is why we are seeing these network laws bear out in token value.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:29:21
Going forward into this escalation in the global currency war, I can only expect Bitcoin to gain value. Initially through being one of the most effective means to export wealth across boarders. Then by the mass realisations that it is has the ability to become the premier store of wealth in this world of heavily manipulated gold &amp; silver markets. Since the announcement that the Chinese Yuan is to be included into the IMF's SDR on October 1st 2016 I'm of the mind the PBoC has a clear target they would like to see Yuan trading in before they step away from the market, This article published shortly after the CNY devaluation on the 10th of August this year makes the suggestion that trading range is 7.5CNY to 1USD &amp; we are currently around 6.4, so we could see another 17.5% decrease in the Yuan's value over the coming 6 months. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:34:37
I think the developing EM crisis is a direct result of the trade war. China exports 5x the value it imports from the USA, as such tariffs sting China 5x harder than any tariff they impose against the US. The thing is China doesn't care too much about how it's Yuan (CNY) competes against the USD. It's far more concerned with how the CNY competes against a basket of currencies called the CFETS basket, which weighs the top 22 currencies from Chinas primary importers agaisnt their respective import percentage points over recent years. This means an EM currency crisis gifts breathing space to the PBoC who fix the price of the Yuan to make adjustments &amp; grossly inflate CNY supply in USD terms, while keeping the purchasing power of the CNY balanced against many EM markets. It's complex, but nations using their national fiat currency supply as a means to negate the effect of tariffs via industry subsidies is why trade wars typically eventually see a reversion to sound money standards. Fiat has just too many vectors in that it can be weaponized in a trade war.

Thanks, I've been reading the transition away from capital controls is now looking to be a more gradual reform process rather than a snap Presidential edict. Primarily because of the engrained nature of the capital control's legal framework &amp; networked characteristics. But the pressures Argentina now faces from such low levels foriegn capital reserves will mean the new Government want to lift these as soon as possible to attract higher levels of foreign investment. All the best going forward.

A peg indicates that the exchange rate between bolivars &amp; the petro will be adjustable by decree if need be. Not unlike the way the USD was onced pegged to gold at $20 per ounce before the outlawing of private gold ownership &amp; confiscation in 1933 followed by an immediate repricing of gold at $35 per ounce. In effect this allowed an immediate 75% increase in the supply of USD's &amp; more importantly award the 1st mover advantage on the purchasing power of those USD's to the federal government to fund Roosevelt's 'New Deal.' I guess the plan is for the petro to act as a asset (oil) backed guarantee to attract foreign investment to strengthen the national currency. Could work. But only time will tell.

"By engaging in such "passive-aggressive" currency warfare, which avoids direct confrontation with Beijing and which may have been conceived during last week's Trump-Xi phone call, the administration would avoid making confrontational claims about whether China is manipulating its currency for trade benefit, the WSJ reports, in the process allowing Xi to save face and avoid having to defend himself domestically in a key year politically for the Chinese president. Trump also avoids looking weak, as eventually exporter complaints can be addressed via conventional channels, resulting in tariffs and other anti-subsidy actions, as has been the case for many years under the Obama administration."
So sounds like the deval will continue as normal. Besides, when the CNY is weighted against the only basket that now matters in Beijing, The CFETS basket of China's major trading partners it's barely off the lows:
Currency Inflation is the only way out for any Keynesian system of debt backed fiat to address it's debt problem. Hence why deflation is the system killer. With the huge amount of debt weighing down growth for most of the Superpower economies of the world this trend can only continue in one direction until it's hyper inflationary (debt jubilee) conclusion will be realised. Only then will sound money assets be the only thing of any value still left standing to provide the capital base &amp; command the means of production to rebuild the world anew. In other words why Central Banks are the biggest holders of Gold, &amp; they are hoping nobody notices the fact that Bitcoin is better than Gold in every way.

True, but 100:1 leverages against hard assets on futures contracts that settle in the majority in USD rather than the underlying asset 'promised' for delivering, then that secondary futures market becoming the primary informer of price discovery somewhat helps diminish golds role as a store of wealth.

I won't argue against the prudent strategy of diversification. I'm just pointing out Bitcoin has a number of inherent functions that out perform gold's where it matters for a form of sound money.

8 years is a long time to invest in a relationship &amp; the last thing I'd imagine you'd want is all that to go to waste. From the ultimatum she has clearly put before you, she has a road map for her future that includes you. But if you hadn't also noticed yet, that same road map obviously rates higher to her than you do. That much was made evident by the ultimatum. All the same, she might be having issues of trust if you only shared positively slanted information with her &amp; might come still around after the initial shock &amp; after further discussion with you.
You obviously made your investment into bitcoin after researching the likelihood of it being of greater value in the future than what it is when you bought in. 2 months ago bitcoin was $750 &amp; as of this moment it is $915 so you are still up some 20% or more by my assumptions. I disagree with your assessment that the price has 'crashed' as 20-50% consolidations are not unusual for Bitcoin during it's broader parabolic bull runs
But this is a matter for you to DYODD &amp; make your own trading plans &amp; timeframes. Personally I see Bitcoin as one of the few true safe havens left &amp; because of it's deflationary nature it's value won't ever reach an equilibrium against ever expanding inflationary fiat that it is so often valued against. Especially against the backdrop of a global currency war &amp; all that that entails. I think Bitcoin is still in the throws of a secular bull market that may continue for decades to come ( The reason I think Bitcoin can regularly weather these otherwise asset killing corrections/crashes is due to the fact that it is a freehold asset that pays no yield being valued &amp; traded mostly against inflationary fiat for this reason the only market mechanism to encourage distribution is the price discovery mechanism to appeal to market participants fear &amp; greed.
Finally I might add, being a veteran of 2 failed marriages, go MGTOW. Women have a disproportionate level of legal protections in stark contrast to a males perceived disposability. Statistically speaking any man with a live in girlfriend let alone wife is setting himself up to lose. And in some cases when alimony or child support is involved that loss can be ongoing &amp; legally enforceable with both asset seizure &amp; jail time. I wish I was joking but that's the state of things for men in this day &amp; age. For your own sake get woke &amp; checkout AVFM before you get hitched.

"The government tries to make us all relaxed about that through their depositor guarantee scheme up to $250,000 per ADI (Authorise Deposit-taking Institution).  There are traps within as one ADI includes all subsidiaries (like St George to Westpac or Bank West to CBA etc).  There is also a $20b cap per ADI and that may not be enough to cover everyone in that ADI.  The bigger the better is hence counterintuitive as there are more mouths to feed with that $20b.  Timing is another thing.  PPP’s Vern Gowdie wrote just this week about the fact that 90% of deposits are held by just 10% of our financial institutions, or 9 banks in number.  They are the ‘too big to fail’s’ and leave 75 other institutions that wouldn’t cause the chaos of the big guys if it took a while to resolve.  That is where the Financial Claims Scheme (FCS) comes in to play.  From the RBA:
“‘...The FCS is a form of deposit insurance that provides depositors with certainty that they will quickly recover their deposits (up to the predefined cap) in the event that an Australian ADI fails.
‘The FCS is administered by APRA and operates as follows. 
•    The Scheme is activated at the discretion of the Australian Treasurer where APRA has applied to the Federal Court for an ADI to be wound up. This can only be done when APRA has appointed a statutory manager to assume control of an ADI and APRA considers that the ADI is insolvent and could not be restored to solvency within a reasonable period. 
•    Upon its activation, APRA aims to make payments to account-holders up to the level of the cap as quickly as possible — generally within seven days of the date on which the FCS is activated. 
•    The method of payout to depositors will depend on the circumstances of the failed ADI and APRA’s assessment of the cost-effectiveness of each option. Payment options include cheques drawn on the RBA, electronic transfer to a nominated account at another ADI, transfer of funds into a new account created by APRA at another ADI, and various modes of cash payments.’”
So to be clear APRA must first try and rescue the ADI and if that fails it must gain the support of the Treasurer to go to court to declare the ADI insolvent, it must go through the court process, and THEN you get your money “generally within seven days”…
All of the above also assumes some form of order and not mass panic and bank runs as we’ve seen more recently in Greece and Cyprus."

1) I think you will find a tax collection agency have a different modus operandi than a Central Bank.
2) Bitcoin is a sound money asset &amp; is unlikely to find equilibrium against fiat money. This leaves it at the mercy of market forces such as fear &amp; greed to motivate market participants to distribute the asset. Furthermore it's still a very young asset class &amp; is in the process of finding fair value against other sound money assets such as silver &amp; gold. There are many forces that prevent this process from taking the most direct path, such as the high level of manipulation that pervades the precious metals market. Also the varying rate that Bitcoin is distributed via market forces amongst a growing base of market participants.

I feel awful for gold bugs, by the measure of the last 5000 years of economic &amp; monetary policy precedence, they did everything right by buying gold in response to the GFC. But alas the distortionary effects of a dominate secondary futures &amp; ETF market leveraged more than 100:1, &amp; specialty QE fuelled trading desks at some of the worlds largest &amp; most influential banks in global finance, including the BiS. And that dominate secondary market directly informing price discovery whilst offloading the storage &amp; security risk/cost onto physical investors. Outside of the feel of the actual metal in your hand, the integrity of what was once a cornerstone of global settlement has been all but destroyed.
Furthermore not long ago it was unimaginable that over the horizon would appear a disruptive, permissionless technology that has baked into it's protocol all the sound money functions of gold with the added layer of an inherit good delivery function &amp; zero fee storage facility that allows for global boarderless settlement with no 3rd party oversight at the speed of email. All the while it's freehold design allows for a 24/7 Walrasian auction negate any &amp; all attempts to harness it with the secondary market distortions gold has suffered under.

Perhaps the owners of that gold have a chair under them when the music stops. Perhaps not. Shit could get real, fast. If only there was a way to operate a sound money standard via a means of settlement unadulterated by the distortionary effects to price discovery of secondary markets, because imbued into it's very protocol of settlement itself was a counterfeit proof 'good delivery' mechanism that self audited not just the total unit supply, but who owned what &amp; when.

You really need to read up about divorce statistics (94% of marriages end in divorce inside the first 10 years &amp; 70% of those divorces are initiated by the female, yet men are supposed to be the ones with a problem with commitment)  Get familiar with how men are treated by divorce &amp; family courts in your part of the world. Please realise that across most of the western world a women can lay claim on her ex-husband/partners wealth &amp; productive output until any children they had together graduate from college. And some nations will force you to pay alimony to your ex-wife to provide for her the lifestyle she has become accustomed with until she starts a new common law relationship with another man. Often the divorce court will divide assets along percentage lines reflective of the care agreements of custody decided by family courts, which is often awarded to the mother. So the typical 1 weekend a fortnight for the man would mean she gets more than 85% of your asset base. In short she will have legal claim on your wealth whether she chooses to remain married to you or not. Run those options thru the 'prisoners dilemma' &amp; tell me which option looks peachy to you? Seriously you need to get 'red pilled' to the likelihood that divorce is an inevitable part of life for every married man out there in this day &amp; age. 'Red pill' philosophy &amp; MGTOW is a crucial understanding for any man who wants to preserve his asset base &amp; productive output.

I think it has more to do with the overall measure of trust in the economic outlook across an economy. Low trust in business growth, sees a good portion of the trust migrate into the means of settlement itself. This does 2 things. 1) It increases the value of money, incentivizing its procurement. 2) Increased business activity around the procurement of money helps provide a pilot light keeping the economy stimulated during it's darkest days. Besides this we can also expect to see during a crisis opportunities abound for the foolhardiest of workers employing simple yet cheap albeit inefficient labor theories of value completing on an equal footing with those employing the more expensive yet efficient workshop theory of value. This is why I believe we see all thruout human history a return to gold standards grow out of the depths of a crisis, then that pure form of money forming the economic foundations to build an economic empire anew.

I actually struggled with this concept in my early days as well. But then I learned about the underlying network science that creates the power laws of distribution we often see in not just cryptocurrencies, but across most categories of things. Two key concepts that helped explain to me why Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency &amp; in all likelihood would continue to be so was [Pareto Distribution &amp; Zipf's Law]( with Zipf's law being a more detailed analogue study of the digital 80/20 rule of Pareto Distribution; notwithstanding Fibonacci gets a shoe in especially in matters pertaining to timing with the last 2 times gold hit near parity with the Dow Jones (1933 &amp; 1980) predicting to the quater the genesis of Bitcoin in 2009 (1980 - 1933 = 47, × 1.618 = 76, +1933 = 2009. I believe it is a simple 'prisoner's dilemma' that surfaces in an economic environment of both finite goods/productive output for sale when the most effective &amp; finite unit of account that is acceptable by all economic participants, whilst still invoking the greatest level of value on offer AKA Gresham's Law. Zipf's law might see Bitcoin retain a dominant market share overall, but it isn't an argument for Bitcoin maximalists, but rather more of a Friedmanian argument for money to compete. Furthermore history shows us that this is typical of sound money systems, which often historically involved gold, silver, nickel &amp; copper coinage that often see cetain overarching conditions market a higher price premium to some metals over others. Bitcoin might not be perfect, but it was first &amp; it was adequate. Even biological evolution is full of similar observations, wherein often apparent 'design flaws' that evolved to afford survivability are worked around, sometimes solving the problem outright or even manipulated into outright advantages.

Only if those peanut shells can settled at the speed of an email, across boarders as if they don't exist at all; without any 3rd party oversight &amp; does all this without needing to ask permission even once from any individual superpower, empire, nation, corporation, business or person; It achieves this because it mimicks digitally all the monetary properties of history's last great non elastic unit of account, store of wealth &amp; means of settlement: Gold. Whilst retaining thru it's own protocol the ability to achieve 100% secure 'good delivery' without the need of a multi billion dollar naval armada to ensure the vessel of transport isn't commandeered or lost to the inaccessible briny depths of the ocean floor by thieves or geopolitical disruptors alike. The gold standard was born out of defacto need rather than fiat decree. Bitcoin's journey from $0.06 to $3500.00 today isn't any different. Enterprising folks of productive means can see it's potential as a monetary gamechanger &amp; enter willingly into it's 'prisoner's dilemma' for a countless array of reasons &amp; it is still early days. And for that reason it's price discovery fluctuates wildly. But I can imagine the early days of gold asserting itself against the backdrop of a pseudo barter/peanut shell economy being no different dependant on the surplus of goods &amp; output against the prevailing aggregate levels of trust in the economic environment of the day. Bitcoin holds value today because enough people can see it's value today to buy or sell today it, at today's value. As the world steps ever closer to a macro economic reset, be it born of protectionism or demographics; elastic fiat money has imbued risk that sound money does not. For that reason I'm happy to hodl.

I'm pretty sure if this was true, Russia wouldn't officially announce taking a position in Bitcoin to the world until they already had the position taken if that was possible to avoid sending the price higher. Perhaps buying mostly over the counter. I'd imagine that some high ranking officials with an eye to the markets &amp; how they move, might want to front run this news &amp; take a position themselves. His story kind of checks out for me.

So in 2014 during the G20 meet up in Brisbane Australia a reccomendation was put forward for all nations to prepare banking bail-in legislation because they realized the sovereign debt loads were now insurmountable due in part to the costly bail-outs from the GFC &amp; other factors such as the demographic cliff. Most nations have since snuck these policies through parliament &amp; the senates. Australia's bail-in laws went thru in February 2018 during a late night session with only 7 or 8 senators present. Albeit camouflaged in plain site behind government legalese &amp; entitled as such. A number of financial analysts, such as Martin North (from the video above) &amp; economist John Adams have been drilling down into the vague &amp; open to interpretation legislation &amp; discovered it is in fact very much a bail-in law. Now some nations such as New Zealand are quite open about their bail-in law being exactly that. But in Australia the official line has been that the 'APRA crisis resolution powers legislation' isn't a bail-in law. Many concerned Australians have since been writing to their elected members &amp; senators for reassurance that their bank deposits are safe under this law. Typically they all get the same carbon copied Department of Treasury response back whispering that everything is alright &amp; to go back to sleep. However a new LNP Senator Amanda Stoker, who worked as a Barrister before her election to the Australian Senate, known for doing their own legal digging in the search for truth, replied after being asked for the same assurance on the safety of bank deposits by one of her constituents:
*“The legislation facilitates bail-in as a type of resolution power which is available for dealing with financial institution distress. This was done after the G20 leaders endorsed a new Financial Stability Board standard for Total Loss-absorbing Capacity. Specifically, it builds on the Key Attributes which specifies that Financial Stability Board jurisdictions should have in place legally enforceable mechanisms to implement a bail-in. The purpose of the Total Loss-absorbing Capacity standard ensures there are mechanisms in place to stop the ‘domino effect’ and reduce loss on [sic] bank shareholders, creditors and the Government.”*
Thus smashing the facade &amp; bringing to the fore the immediate need to amend or abolish the legislation. And IMO why it's prudent in everyone of these nations implementing these Cyprus style bail-in laws to hodl a little Bitcoin.

Jeffrey Wernick is an independent investor whose portfolio includes early holdings in Uber and Airbnb. Wernick was also an early investor in bitcoin. He started buying it in 2009, the year it was created.
Wernick’s initial interest in bitcoin was not just speculation that the price would rise. He believes bitcoin’s value comes from its ability to solve the biggest problems with fiat money.
Wernick believes the ability to run large deficits and debase the currency changes the relationship between the government and its citizens. He believes it gives the government the ability to do things without the consent of the people.
Wernick says bitcoin solves these problems because it is a “people’s currency, it’s defined by the people, and it’s defined by rules and a protocol that people trust.”

Taking this article on face value for a moment, it does raise an interesting considerations about a centrally planned NIRP based economy.
It makes a leap half way thru after concluding NIRP would be mostly unworkable within a cash money economy, offering a means for individuals to circumvent the negative interest rates banks would impose on savers. (Even the linked article from the Fed itself more or less comes to this same conclusion.) Thus any effective Negative Interest Rate Policy would depend on a blockchain ledger for auditing purposes.
But this conclusion would require the even greater leap that in a NIRP world, a new regulatory frame work would first have to be constructed that would impose a tax in the guise of a negative interest rate cost on the holdings of any commodity based money. Even if it's held privately.
It's not like the easily audited blockchain ledger underpinning crypto would make this difficult.

Sounds a lot like Wall St now, well the part about most trading happening via bots. I guess the efficiency of bots is based on the sample timeframe they are basing their decisions on. Also fundamental drivers at this early stage are perhaps lost on bots. For example a conflict breaking out, market technical analysis can often underestimate the human emotional reaction to these kind of events. But I think for free markets are to remain free, human traders will have to maintain the right &amp; ability to jump into that automated trading floor &amp; participate any time it is open. I personally see technical analysis as a soft science at best on smaller time frames, but becomes more robust against fundamental economic laws across multi year timeframes. I guess that's why Bitcoin is paying out for the HODLers. That and the fact Bitcoin as an asset meets both the labour &amp; utility theories of value, coupled with it's deflationary nature similar to gold can only gain value macro economically speaking as long as we continue to price it in highly inflationary fiat currency, that's issuance is directly bound to sovereign debt in this era of ever expanding big government.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:37:58
Your right. Bitcoin is the first time in human history someone has actually thought about designing a better form of money from the ground up, rather than just derive it from the deflationary units of value such as gold, silver or shells that have grown out of the necessity to exchange value in the economic power vacuum that is left behind after yet another fiat currency collapse. Bitcoin's difficulty retarget allows it to scale in both directions, whilst it's sound monetary attributes will always incentivise it's expansion during times of economic recession &amp; depression.

I'm no expert on the situation, but from what I understand any official transactions processed through the Argentine banking system would use the lower official exchange rate &amp; any off the books business conducted between individuals (think between tourists &amp; locals) used the higher unofficial rate. Perhaps due to the ongoing downward slope devaluation the peso has been experiencing for years, driving up demand amongst private citizens for a safer store of value like the USD. I imagine the disparity between the two rates gave the banking system an opportunity to build USD reserves, so these could be sold to the central bank, &amp; then sold to sure up the peso in international markets.

"The take-away from this post is that if interest rates go negative, we may see an epochal outburst of socially unproductive—even if individually beneficial—financial innovation. Financial service providers are likely to find their products and services being used in volumes and ways not previously anticipated, and regulators may find that private sector responses to negative interest rates have spawned new risks that are not fully priced by market participants."

But it's a typical preservation of wealth strategy in a fiat system. If your national central bank is pursuing an ongoing monetary policy that is diminishing the purchasing power of your fiat savings you roll over those savings into a more robust wealth vehicle. I'd imagine that strategy for many wealthy Chinese people would take the form of capital flight into a competing national currency that the PBoC as stated, is actively trying to devalue the Yuan against. As China has a 50,000 CNY legal limit on the quantity of money a Chinese citizen can send abroad each year, I'd imagine many wealthier individuals who have decided that, that is not good enough will innovate to find alternatives to export their wealth. The correlation currently being observed in the spread between on &amp; offshore yuan &amp; Bitcoin's price movements suggest Bitcoin is being employed in that process. Apart from this circumstantial evidence It will be difficult for anyone to present a hard evident case to be observed, as capital flight is usually carried out by individuals, for their own personal advantage in secret.

Also perhaps the biggest confirmation yet that NIRP is coming to an advanced market economy near you.

Can someone please turn that into a tank? That would be so awesome!

Just like other markets in this global economy, an event in one nation can effect the price of a given asset in all nations, as that new demand, or supply is quickly priced in by market speculators. You may of seen this in oil &amp; gold markets when a conflict breaks out. In that example prices for these commodities will often move up globally, even in territories that are not remotely affected by the conflict.

Yeah, it shows such a correlation. Shame I can't post it as a pic here in the comments. Next best thing, I'll link it here:

I don't think the bailout or the QE's (&amp; not to forget ZIRP) have been brushed under the rug per se. It is true these massive increases in the money supply didn't result in significant CPI inflation (yet). But that is only because of the way this capital was distributed directly onto the balance sheets of banks, to fuel even higher investment debt, rather than into the hands of an already debt burdened working &amp; middle class. You can see this by the massive injection of investment into stocks, shares &amp; more importantly energy infrastructure spending since the 2008 GFC.  Unfortunately for the Fed this Keynesian approach has ultimately failed dismally &amp; they now find themselves in a position where they can't even raise interest rates 0.25%. This is a worst case scenario for the Fed &amp; will leave them with few other alternatives than to implement NIRP.
The Fed has often written about NIRP. This article published in 2012 suggests the entire approach to how ordinary people approach banking could be turned on it's head: 
"The take-away from this post is that if interest rates go negative, we may see an epochal outburst of socially unproductive—even if individually beneficial—financial innovation. Financial service providers are likely to find their products and services being used in volumes and ways not previously anticipated, and regulators may find that private sector responses to negative interest rates have spawned new risks that are not fully priced by market participants."
So I'm personally thinking that could become a pretty chaotic &amp; confusing period in time forabsent of viable alternatives to nationally issued fiat currency. Quite the use case for Bitcoin &amp; other traditional stores of wealth IMO.

The Baby Boomer generation (Born 1946-1965) on aggregate are sitting on the majority of the worlds wealth. The smart money amongst them is beginning to realise that all generations that have proceeded them are the most impoverished thanks to anaemic wage growth resulting in only lethargic uptake in investment &amp; ownership of the means of production at it's currently over inflated prices. In other words, when this boomer generation begins to retire &amp; start selling assets to fund their retirement en masse, into what capital base are they hoping sell these assets too? Diversification of their wealth base into a sound means of value transfer &amp; value storage that is recognised by those proceeding generations in this centrally planned highly interventionist fiat system is perhaps the only sane option left for them.
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:46:35
Don't get me wrong, I'm not taking a jab at Boomers. Rather just pointing at the demographic cliff it's becoming clear we are about to hurtle over:

"Two pioneering Australian fintech companies were off and running on Wednesday under the pleased eye of trumpeter of innovation and Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull.  
Sydney-based company OnMarket Book Build launched an online platform to allow retail investors to bid on IPO stock, and Bitcoin Group, will be the IPO guinea pig, hoping to raise $20 million."

Reading finex's small print, it becomes apparent shorts might of missed this detail:
"Due to the net amount of BTC committed in margin positions at the time of the fork, the above methodology may result in Bitfinex seeing a surplus or deficit of BCH. As such, we will be resolving this discrepancy in the form of a socialized distribution coefficient."
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:53:50
I read that in the comments too. Makes me wonder if the huge amount of shorters on finex realise they will only get a socialised fraction of what they are betting on.

It could be argued WW1 &amp; 2 were the hot war consequences of a trade war that started in earnest around 1912-1913 &amp; [raged]( until the end of WW2. Back then most folks with an understanding of the macro economic progression of empire would of sited Germany with it massive industrial output as the most likely candidate to take the mantle from Great Britain as global economic superpower, but instead they both duked it out until they were both on the ropes &amp; the USA swooped in for the win. Classic ['so long sucker']( game theory move that. But I digress. If hot war is often preceded by trade war, it makes sense that the means of settlement itself becomes the last bastion of trust amongst players who cannot necessarily trust each other. During WW2 Germany's U-Boat program disrupted not only merchant shipping, but physical trade settlement as required under the gold standard of the day, especially as it was backdropped by war. Interestingly the [sinking of significant fractions of the total gold supply]( to inaccessible depths &amp; unknown locations across the sea bed only bolstered the purchasing power of any gold still accessible on land for trade. This laid bare a unique vulnerability of Great Britain as a naval superpower. Should the current developing trade war go full global tit for tat, ricocheting across the many differing global players, as trade wars so often do; the easy weaponization of national fiat currencies will no doubt see a defacto reversion to sound monetary means of settlement. As detailed above gold &amp; silver has been shown to be quite vulnerable, notwithstanding it's incompatibility with a connected world that is likely to see it's first strong AI systems present themselves in the coming decades. Every system has it's own unique vulnerabilities. For Bitcoin that is the infrastructure of the internet itself.

I've watched quite a few criticisms of Peterson's conclusions, most are lack luster attacks on his faith &amp; his method of reinvigorating history to explain many of the modern shortcomings we see today. I guess for me results speak for themselves. Much like Bitcoin has 'died' over 400 times since it's inception, yet it's here with us today because it makes sense to enough people to invest into it as a SoW, MoE &amp; UoA. The guy wouldn't be getting such traction if what he says didn't make sense amongst the madness.
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:44:47
True, when you look at how essential the internet is to the 'just in time' mode of operation used by modern supply chains which distribute goods essential for human survival; internet anti fragility &amp; the survival of large scale human societies are fast becoming codependent.

Going full global coverage is huge man. It positions Bitcoin uniquely as the premier global sound means of settlement.

I doubt there is a story. Seqlar is just doing the typical snipey shit sling I've come to expect from regressive types when they want to distract from a message that undermines their beliefs.
