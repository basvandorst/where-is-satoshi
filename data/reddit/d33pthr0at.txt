Yes. OTG is USB On The Go, which requires a separate adapter to connect your micro USB Trezor cable. 
Mycelium + Trezor is functionally equivalent to myTrezor and Electrum + Trezor. Both Electrum and Mycelium support tor servers, which are popular amongst some, but bitcoin was never designed to be completely anonymous.  I think a realistic aim is about as much privacy as you would have when paying with cash in person.
The biggest risk with elaborate fragmentation schemes is [catastrophic failure]( and loss of bitcoin.
You wouldn't convert your life's savings to gold,  then subdivide and bury it all over the country side, nor should you do so with your fragmented mnemonic. 
hardware wallets make spending easy, with near equivalent security as a paper wallet.  Go out and spend some bitcoin, if you want to obfuscate your balances somewhat, split according to source your bitcoin into separate accounts. 
Localbitcoins -&gt; Account 1
Circle -&gt; Account 2
Mining income -&gt; Account 3
Everyday spending -&gt; Account 4
Cold storage -&gt; Account 5
Electrum does allow you to choose which inputs you're sending from. Keep a small "cash" amount on your phone wallet, top as required with your chosen hardware wallet/multisig/armory lockbox solution.

[Don't get yourself too bound down ](  by unassailable scenarios. 
[If a 3 letter agency wants to target you ](   then [you](  are [completely]( and utterly [pwned](  .  
 [Truecrypt is probably not safe ](  if your aggressor is a [3 letter agency]( 
[Even googling these topics will place you on a watchlist]( 
A 50 character random password is no better than a 30 or 40 character password. Always use strong unique passwords, keepass+yubikey works well.
[Trezor is breakable, they don't claim not to be](  as is [ledger](   Badusb has been [debunked](  many many times, and the above hardware wallets are not susceptible.
I don't know why you linked USB Armory as it has no connection to bitcoinarmory.com
Practical Solutions :
* Use Multisig, no single point of failure. 
* Consider cheap $35 Arm single board computer(s)
* Coinkite multisig supports [offline signing]( up to n=15, offers an .onion server and [supports Ledger](
* use Offline bundles, either the [Armory Pi offline bundle or make your own]( 
* you could use the Pi camera and QR codes `zbarimg -d` (or [audio signals]( as per electrum 2) to transfer the unsigned/signed transaction from your online machine to your cold offline machine and back. You could even use [blockchain.info]( or eligius to broadcast it for you.
Alternatives :
* Trezor + otg cable + android + tor/orbot + mycelium = awesome
* ledger + otg + android + Greenbits = works well
* Consider removing physical connections if you're extra paranoid, epoxy glue etc
