They require less verification in some countries, which give buyers more privacy. Most Bitcoin ATMs in Canada require nothing or at most a phone number for operators that are trying to be compliant for rules that they would need to abide by, were they to be a MSB (Money Transmitter in the USA). No regulations exist yet in many jurisdictions. Additionally, online exchanges can be overwhelming for some. Therefore, go to an ATM, cash in, bitcoin out and presto chango you're done. 
Edit: They also give Bitcoin a face. Many people discredit them, but like it or not a Bitcoin ATM in a high traffic location does alot more than a website that no one strolls past while going about their day.

Proof or it doesn't matter. Heard this 52 times already.

Where's that deal? 10 ATMs in hand delivered for free anywhere in North America. Pretty decent. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:57:33
No catch, free delivery in North America also.

10/979 have been stolen. 
1% of all bitcoin ATMs have been stolen? ��
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:42:52
I've been paying that on my cash deposits in North America for over a year, for the simple fact I'm a bitcoin company... 
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:34:35
I definitely lol'd

It's been 4 hours... I sell a lot of BTC. I am unfamiliar with this scenario, to be honest.
@_date: 2017-04-19 11:58:47
That's like being concerned for sharing knowledge about a local organic farm at a big-chain grocery store. Haters gonna hate. Love those guys for still coming out to the party. lol

No possible way. Tell me what would have been the best solution, almighty Could not be more excited to hear your infinite wisdom on the topic. 
Sometimes you have to get a rise out of people. I saw 10 smiling optimistic faces while I ranted about solutions. They all loved it and one OFFERED to take the picture. What have you done lately?
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:11:36
Well there are 43 of them on coinatmradar.com so are they are to be taken down for false advertisement?

Being your own bank and voting on a blockchain (rather than in an alterable current voting method) en mass would not allow for corruption in the sense you speak of.

See below.
Edit: When a toll is instated on a bridge or highway and paid off, where does that money go? Society could build it for way less and efficiently if we all pitched in pennies, roads would be built. Demand creates supply, amigo.

What are the fees or is it straight across at time of redemption? 
@_date: 2017-04-25 19:27:38

Excellent point, Luke. However, there is room for plenty of corruption beyond the view of the citizenry with any centralized structure. May I add to my statement "A better form of decentralized government can exist with the current technological advancements in modern society?" 
@_date: 2017-04-25 12:40:35
Exactly. Anything centralized to me is a failed project at this point. I do not know what it looks like in a decentralized govermental structure, but anything is better than this. 
The most dangerous thing to traditional systems are the powerful men that emerge in the digital currency age. They will have a difficult time stopping wealthy men that have no greed due to transparency and millennial mentality.

The coat was zipped up until two people behind me started vocalizing their frustrations... As soon as "this is f ridiculous," was expressed by multiple people deeper in the line it was fair game I'd say. We all cringed about the line together and discussed options. Pretty grassroots-awesome, ;)

M'lady gobbled the D whilst I gallantly laughed about ye armchair critics smiting this post. Le sighhhh.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:59:21
2% better at the KYC ATM. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:55:39
Edit: The ATM operator sends a text verification code to type in before you can use the ATM.

Vault of Satoshi in Canada. Founders found a less controversial and more lucrative opportunity and simply closed the doors. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:48:58
What are the fees?
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:16:49
What are you talking about? If you want context just ask. I run a company in the space. The customer is trying to say I didn't send him btc. He gave the the wrong address on HIS computer and is trying to tell me to compensate. HELP! I'm not trolling anyone you presuming  judgemental ass.
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:19:21
I have told this to THOUSANDS of clients also. Exact same story, but only verbally. I chuckled seeing what my mind envisions every time I tell people this.
@_date: 2016-10-06 15:14:29
@_date: 2016-10-07 20:16:33
This should be added! 
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:24:01
The address I sent the requested amount to. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:11:22
I don't need the money back, I just need to prove where it went.

I'm interested for sure. Locked out of mine at the moment. Claims unable to link to hotwallet. UTF8 character error? Is this a completely new software for it? 
@_date: 2016-07-25 15:31:37
I lol'd. They really have a firm grasp of what's going on here.
