This is something I've been figuring out the last month since I changed my strategy, the money invested it's something I would easily lost hanging out or buying useless things. I personally think it's a good time to buy right now for a long term investment, the return will be Hugh when it comes back to a higher price

I said NEM blockchain not XEM altcoin, I mean the technology not the trading token... Take a look on it and you'll find out what bitcoin blockchain lacks.

I don't mean trading volume, I mean your personal volume. Let's say you have 0.133 btc, your goal should be to rise it to a safe margin as much as you can regardless its price, so working this way and the time its price worth more than 10k you will have around 0.3 or more (these numbers are example). Patience is the key, you'll find out you learned to take better decisions.

Venezuelan here, I'm sure we all die first before venezuela turns itself as the first fiatless country. They are all survival mode and the government is making things worst. Even if the crypto would be widely accepted making profit and this government is still ruling, they will size anything as they have done before.

My first investment was 3 months ago (very naive) when it was at 9k and went up to 10k, it was amazing to see how it was rising. I took my profits and went all the way to BCH/BTC, since then I have lost almost 70&amp; in the first BTC invested volume. Then I invested again, this time in ether when it was at 720$ this time I changed my strategy and double up my ETH volume in total my volume was up 40&amp; before BTC felt to 6500. Today it's another story, the crash now it's getting me red numbers. 
Next week, if the price it's down again I'm willing to invest the same amount I did the last 2 times in order to get my volume back so I'll know what my real earnings will be when BTC goes back to 9200$, I expect to get 3x to 5x ROI.

Let's do it! At least I'm not the only one

Focus in rising your crypto volumes instead of crypto price, the more volume you have eventually you will get more dollars when the price goes up. 
I started watching the price and found out it's not good for my nerves then when I realized the true potential that any blockchain offers I got really into this new technology.

I'm using it as a "saving account" and trade when it's not so volatile, I stopped trading and still have open order and everyday it's getting far away from it. I focus on the amount of BTC I can possible get rather than watching the price. I've lost 25&amp; of btc amount and almost 52&amp; in dollar value, so It's not that depressing.

I've done it but I guess my luck is cursed or something, I only set stop profit because it's harder to reach it. Every time I decide to sell the price goes up the same when I buy... So no stop when it's done I understood how to be patience.

Secure done. I'm on it Blockchain technology is awesome and it's sad to see many cripto traders only focusing in prince instead of using the technology.

Not buying now? When it's lower? Or never?
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:38:13
that's the kind of luck I have, unfortunately I'm not a whale to sell to see the chart rocketed to the sky

I have not understood yet how to follow technical analysis, sometime it gets so confusing.

Very good comment, I have to pay more attention to patterns and you are right, it changes at anytime so fast. I remain calm since  I have a little amount invested, the only thing that matters to me is to accumulate as much BTC as possible and to learn a lot.
