So LN is like new crypto on top of BTC. Why not just make LN without BTC? Can LN work without BTC? Is there similar crypto working on LN princip?

Who pays the difference in price if BTC goes up after settlement dates? CME/CBOE? Does CME/CBOE instant buy BTC on current market so they can sell it later on settlement dates? 
Or, is it contract user-user (2 clients bet for BTC) on futures market CME/CBOE? Eather way I wouldn't bet against long-term BTC price...

This is a nice graph. People think that power consumption will rise to infinity. I was reading some news with the trend for BTC power consumption if it keeps it will be "some big number" in 2022. Power consumption will hit the upper limit and it will not scale to infinity. Power consumption will be in balance with BTC price, block reward (reduced with next halving) and cost of power.

What about mempool? Mempool is on SSD or RAM?

I expect in future to energy consumption will be in balance (~=) with BTC block + fee reward.  
Some data for BTC:  
Annualized global mining revenues	$6,131,069,068  
Annualized estimated global mining costs	$3,556,216,066  
So there is space for increasing energy. (Ofc it depends on price BTC/USD and kWh/cent).

That's probably not the answer we were looking for.
