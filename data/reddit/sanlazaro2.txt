At current prices, the minerals contained in asteroid 16 Psyche are said to be worth $700 quintillion -- enough to give everyone on the planet $93 billion. We’re all going to be richer than Jeff Bezos!  OK, now for the bad news: This isn’t going to happen. Yes, 16 Psyche and other asteroids will probably be mined for their metals. But once those metals start hitting the market in large quantities, they’re unlikely to be precious for much longer. As any introductory economics student knows, price is a function of relative scarcity -- flood the market with gold, and it will go from being a rarity to being a common decoration. Supply goes up, price goes down.

This is what Gemini said
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:44:07
Gemini’s real-time, dynamic maker-taker fee schedule provides an institutional-grade trading experience that allows market participants to be charged as low as a 0 bps (0.00%) fee on all liquidity-making trades and be charged as low as a 10 bps (0.10%) fee on all liquidity-taking trades.
DYNAMIC FEE SCHEDULE
Your fee rate for each trading pair is determined by your gross trading volume for that trading pair over a 30 calendar day trailing window. Your fee rate for each trading pair will be recalculated every day at midnight UTC (7:00 p.m. EST/8:00 p.m. EDT) and applied to all your trades going forward from that time.
REAL-TIME FEE CALCULATION
We calculate fees as a fraction of the notional value of each trade (i.e., price × amount). We use units of basis points (“bps”), which represent 1/100th of a percent of notional value. For example, a fee of 25 bps means that 0.25% of the denominated value of the trade will be kept by our exchange, either deducted from the gross proceeds of a trade or charged to the account at the time a trade is executed. Any fees will be applied in real-time at the time a trade is executed. For partially filled orders, only the executed portion is subject to trading fees.
MAKER VS. TAKER
Every trade on a continuous order book involves two orders: one that provides liquidity to the order book, and another that removes liquidity from the order book. For a buy or sell order to provide liquidity, it must first be posted to the order book. This means that it doesn’t fill immediately since it doesn’t match with and trade against an existing order; instead it must rest on the order book until another order matches and trades against it. This kind of buy or sell order adds liquidity to the marketplace and is called liquidity-making — the customer who places it is referred to as a maker. On the other hand, a buy or sell order that immediately matches with and trades against an existing order on an order book removes liquidity from the marketplace and is called liquidity-taking — the customer who places it is referred to as a taker. Because liquidity-making orders do not fill immediately and, therefore, bear more market risk, they receive greater incentives.

I bought a lot times $500 dollars worth of btc in Gemini because they allow $500 a day transfer from my bank and use to be $1.25 fee for $500 dollars worth of btc !!! Now is $4.95 for the same $500 dollar worth of btc !!! That’s why I post here my comment because maybe is just me for buy too often !!!
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:39:45

@_date: 2018-04-03 04:40:34
Beginning April 2, 2018, we will be updating our fee schedule for each of our three trading pairs: BTC/USD, ETH/USD, and ETH/BTC. You can see our updated Trading Fee Schedule here. This new fee schedule will go into effect at midnight UTC, April 2, 2018 (7:00 pm ET, April 1, 2018), and then be applied to all trades going forward from that time.
