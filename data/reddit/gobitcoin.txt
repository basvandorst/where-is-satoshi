I use Authy, which as far as I can tell doesn't have phone call option in the app. I can see they have it as an API configuration if you built your own 2FA app, but it appears Authy app users are safe from this.

I don't really understand the website. There is no About page or anything that explains what it's for. I also need a "Unity Web Player" to see the embassy, but I'd prefer not to download it, is there any other way? How do you explain this website to people? Is there a fallback for people that don't download the unity web player to see other things on the site??

Wix has been around a long time. Basically they have always provided free websites/hosting (with ads!), and then people can upgrade for a fee (no ads!). The thing I always hated about them, this goes back a long time, but all their sites used to be built on Adobe Flash. I guess at some point they changed that.

Although a "profit" is not literally made with not-for-profit organizations, there are administrative overhead that they take off the top. They don't specify the % of the donation going to the fund vs what is going back to the United Way, but I'd imagine around 8-10% of each donation.

He is not abusive I'll give you that. But he is obnoxious and how comments (at times) are off topic and clearly attempts to troll the person. Now, I have seen some posts by him before I have agreed with, and upvoted, but in my humble opinion that is a bit more on the rare side for him. 
Discussion is good for the community including view points that may counter our own, but to me he walks a fine line, and at times, steps over into the trolling side.

Yes, people's new year resolutions was probably to make better deductions, like bitcoins! :)) $900 end of 2014 is low balling it, like a lot. If we got $1500 by mid year is be happy.

In this situation cold storage is the only way to go. Create a few paper wallets. Then move all your coins spread out to all of them. Then strategically hide your wallets in places that only you know about and where it won't be found/damaged.

This problem exists with or without bitcoin. Smaller businesses always have a tougher time building their reputation and customer base. The length of time to build this is even longer if the SMB is only accepting bitcoins, as the bitcoin market is still relatively small.

This is not true. I saw the post you are talking about and the thread describing in detail the user and their OK Cupid account and all that. Just because that redditor posted the pastebin with the ransom info on the reddit thread, doesn't mean they are the hacker. To me, they were just sharing the pastebin info like everyone else has been for the past day. 
**Edit:** you will also see the pastebins are different, with different bitcoin addresses. this means either the hacker created different pastebins, or the redditor created his own, with his own bitcoin address, trying to cash in on the confusion like a real ahole. I think it's the latter.
Hacker pastebin: 
BTC: 19pta6x1hXzV9F5hHnhMARYbRjuxF6xbbV
Redditor pastebin: 
BTC 14X9zbkPpgQiLA15UYk8yNNpDVRucNY8yj
**Edit again:**
For posterity:


This attacker leaked their reddit account by posting the ransom address in the thread. Look at their previous posts, find the github link with their username. Find their profile on Bitcointalk with the name name, confirm similar interests and posting patterns. Find their email address on page 2, search for the email address with google. You now have their photo and dating profile.
Best of luck.

This is an option Coinbase provides, not a requirement. Obviously Wikimedia chose to require this. There is an easy work around, just fill in dummy info, which is what I did.
Also, I think Wikimedia chose to do this because they need to issue receipts to their donors. If you see below, here is the confirmation screen which has a link to my reciept (I know $1 isn't much, but it helps). 
And here is the reciept which is instantly available, which again, is the reason I think they are requiring the name/address field. 
If they were ever audited, they can say who the donor was. They *should* allow anonymous donations though.

Immigrant worker living in California working really hard. At the end of the month he goes to Western Union to send money back to his family, let's say in El Salvador. WU is going to charge an arm and a leg to send the money and it won't be available for a day or two. Worker pulls out blockchain wallet app (or whatever app), and instead sends money to family back home. 
It costs him .05 cents and the money is there and usable in seconds. 
Immigrant workers walks away with smile on his face talking on the phone to his beloved wife and kids back home who are now eating a nice meal in their house.

thanks. so what do you mean "any lower"? does the difficulty decrease? let's say for the sake of argument, if everyone stopped mining, would difficulty levels drop significantly? I know that won't happen, but like you said, if miners operate a loss, eventually they will stop. Maybe not GPU mining would come back, but would there be a middle ground with chips not as advanced as ASICS would be needed?

yeah, they really awoke the hornets nest on this one. I'm not against the Foundation, but what are they really doing to make bitcoin accepted worldwide?
I think it would really help everyone if the Foundation clearly listed out what task items they are actually doing (on a high level) to accomplish their vision. I read over the core functions and they are great  
Except, what is being done to accomplish this? Can you list out the roadmap on a grander scale, with milestones and goals that need to be accomplished?

I think the main difference is POS sales and online sales. 
Blockchain merchant is great for POS sales but doesn't support online like BitPay and Coinbase do. I think a lot of people say those two as merchant solutions because most of the questions are about how to accept bitcoins for online purchases.

This is what bugs me: the IRS says bitcoins are property, so why the hell is the NYDFS trying to regulate it as 'virtual currency'. Why can't they make up their minds what it is?
If it is property, than Lawsky has no grounds to regulate. However, if bitcoins are treated officially as a currency by the IRS, whether it's just 1's and 0's in the computer, it still has a store of value that can be bought, sold, and traded as money.

this is plausible, but I'm thinking 25+ years away.

So does Bitpay take this into account for Copay?

No I still have it, but I can't get past the 4 digit pin screen. Can you?

How about keeping a % in bitcoin to help support the ecosystem? You can spend bitcoins on pretty much anything across the world now.

I get so tired of seeing these posts but yet nobody ever does anything at all to provide a solution!
Start your own website, with hundreds of photos open to Creative Commons licensing, where journos and bloggers can use the photos for free in their articles. 
Until then people, stop bitching about it!

Thanks for responding Richard. My main query was just to find out if Webroot does/will/plans to accept bitcoin in the future. Maybe it's something you can bring up as customer feedback to pass along?
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:41:42
The bigger and bigger coinbase is getting, the less and less I desire to use them to buy bitcoins. I'm 98% sure (no solid proof, speculation) that they are now sending data to the IRS and anyone that sells/sends coins better report it or get audited.

I applied for customer ops and never heard back (this was a few months ago). Does that mean I failed the initial test, or you're to busy with to many applicants, or you're no longer hiring for that position? Thanks.

I can confirm this happens to me as well, nothing gets carried over into the App when it opens. Not the address nor amount. You will have to manually copy and paste it in (which is what I used to do in Safari). This is a bug, you should report it.

Might as well get a refund, and purchase bitcoins with that money for the current rate, cause difficulty is only going up, and hopefully the price too.
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:44:06
Because it's the Bitcoin foundation doing a favor, it wasn't really intended to go all the way to court! It's an empty threat.

It will still work but the app dev won't be able to push updates to it. So if later an issue/bug/security issue comes up, it won't be able to be fixed. There is definitely a risk to it.

There is no web page that returns exact results for "Bitcoin and the Charity of Violent Physical Struggle" when I search using Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, or DuckDuckGo. The only results all point back to the SkyNews article who doesn't even link to this supposed post. 
Does this mean it doesn't exist, or that these search engines filter results from known terrorist websites (probably set forth by the U.S. Govt)?
**Edit:** I also did a search on the exact quotes provided in the article which is: "instantly allows for shari' only compliant markets that cross all borders" 
and that also returned zero results on all major search engines.

Was this iOS? I know ios isn't supported anymore but I got it before the Apple ban. But now all the Blockchain app ever does is freeze or give me an error :(

They actually made it harder than it needs to be. You don't need a Coinbase account to pay. As long as you have bitcoin in *any wallet* you can pay to that unique bitcoin address to checkout. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:47:36
If I'm not mistaken, the widget code creates a unique address each time it creates a qr code/address to pay to.

Clearly Matonis lived up to his end of the ultimatum. He paid off Tom Butterfield on the condition he skedaddle out of town. Now all his accounts are gone. 
**Edit:** did some more digging. I'm wondering if Tom Butterfield is This post came out several days before the anonymous post about Matonis and the Bitcoin Foundation. 
If you check his comment history he also comments on the UpDown Russian mafia conspiracy

You can use it on Safari too. It's not as great as an 'app' but works fine.

By looking at the posting, it's probably a company looking to market on bitcointalk through user posts instead of ads (which is a bit scammy). For what? Who knows. Maybe an alt coin, maybe for a company that is pro or against bitcoin, or maybe to advocate for a certain opinion. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:37:51

Why get others interested in Bitcoin at all then? If you are interested in Bitcoin for the same reasons that others are, and the price is increasing, these are exciting times.

Now is actually a great time to tell people about Bitcoin, as price spikes are what gets people interested in Bitcoin!

It's due to "market volatility". Bitcoin is much like gold or a stock, where the price is discovered through market demands.
