You're looking at it wrong. Try turning it sideways.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:47:18
Nope, shit's fucked.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:26:24
What is that and is that a good thing?
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:11:19
Why trade it when you can leverage it with fiat currency?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:27:55
...but that means they're right 50% of the time. Those are pretty good odds.

As a taxpayer I do not approve.
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:49:20
I completely agree. It feels like this is a waste of resources and energy.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:46:55
Thank you, this was really helpful!

This don't sound right. Too much hollywood in this developing story.

Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. It's like the people in this subreddit have never taken a class or read a book on investing.
This 'crash' course will surely be a wake-up call for many naive investors.

Well they can pretend to sell narcs.

Oh yay, bitcoin story makes *yahoo* front page.

Who says bitcoin is peaking?

Yes I know. American currency went electronic with the invention of the ATM and lost its 'hard' value when the Federal Reserve took over. I was being facetious.

Is there an option for extra cheese?
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:59:59
I like the idea but defacing a currency to promote an alternative isn't going to win many hearts and minds. What kind of message are you hoping to send?
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:39:48
Well...there's plastic for most purchases now. Is it really worth the effort to stamp a few hundred bills when 99.9% of the people who handle them won't even glance at it let alone scan the QR code to look it up? Of the 0.1% who may make it to the webpage, how many people do you think will give it an extra thought and read into it?
It seems as though you had a light-bulb moment, and without giving it any extra thought you came to the conclusion that 1000's of people would be turned on by some cheesy attempt at advertising an alternative currency, one which a) very few people understand and b) even fewer people will give a second glance. Like I said before, the idea is warranted but the method is flawed. Put an ad in the local paper. You might reach a larger audience.
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:13:52
Hard currency... like gold and silver, right guys?

Ha ha!
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:17:00
Drugs. Probably drugs.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:40:02
Haha those days are long gone! Too much bitcoin spent on the wrong commodity.

Not saying this will happen here, but it is very possible at this point.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:23:19
Why would they be here if they weren't going to 'play' investing? To troll?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:21:24
I feel your pain. I must've exchanged a 100 bitcoin since last summer. *facepalms
