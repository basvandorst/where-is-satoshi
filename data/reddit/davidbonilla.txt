you have to call him, say sorry my friend, i miss our friendship. Once you guys are friends again, convince him $250 is  the real deal.

Greeks are better off buying gold or silver. I wish we could finally have a set price on bitcoin so we could use it as currency and not as a commodity. Most of the people buy bitcoins to speculate, and right now we are still on a big decline. If you ask me we need a set number, moving up and down a bit, but we need Bitcoin to finally work as a currency which was the reason it was created. We need to buy with bitcoin, not to speculate.

I am laughing at your prediction skills

Yes Bitcoin&gt;Bolivar however not because the country is in their worst economic crisis they are better off with bitcoin, they are better off buying dollars from the black market. Cryptocurrency is not a solution for this economical problems due to the current fluctuation you seen on the past 5 years.

My point exactly. I have a family member living in Venezuela, if she would buy 1 bitcoin, she would lost 80 dollars already, bitcoin is far to act as a way to save money, it fluctuates so hard its not good for anything but as gamble.

Sorry to hear that, its a tough moment for Venezuela.

Fluctuation right now on Bitcoin is too severe. I mean 10 dollars change in one day its too severe. Would you spend your currency knowing tomorrow it could be worth 10% more? Thats one thing about bitcoin that is not helping people to use it as a currency. How many times did you use your bitcoins to purchase something? Its really challenging to use bitcoins specially when the price is still fluctuating pretty hard.

Profit is not the concern, the main concern is Stability, Bitcoin is not in any means a way to save money or to keep value of your earnings, is a gamble.

A piece of advice, dont tell your friends to get into bitcoin, getting into bitcoin is a personal risky journey. To your question, the answer is simple, divide 1 m for the current price.
2941 Bitcoins, you will always be subject to the price of the bitcoin compared to the dollar value. Having 10 bitcoins, means you are waiting for a 100 000 dollar value which I dont think it will happen any time soon.
