Acting rationally just means acting to maximize ones preferences in a consistent manner given the available choices. No one is capable of acting completely in this way since our brains are not computers capable of consistently performing evaluations and even if they where they would necessarily have to limit their assessment of a situation in order to be able to do the computation involved: to perform an action out of even a very small set of possibilities requies dealing with a massive explosion of computational complexity. Which is the behavior where the term rationally ignorant comes from. Yes there is rationality and it is very pervasive but it is limited and as a result there is always some behavior that is not the result of a rational process.

The second guy, that's litecoin right?

It is used as a medium of exchange and it does however ephemerally store value even without the underlying currencies/commodities that are used by the system. It may be an entirely different protocol than bitcoin but it is still brilliant for what it is used for.

Maybe some drug dealers want to donate anonymously: drug dealers need information too you know.

"A donation is a gift given by physical or legal persons, typically for charitable purposes and/or to benefit a cause. A donation may take various forms, including cash offering, services, new or used goods including clothing, toys, food, and vehicles. It also may consist of emergency, relief or humanitarian aid items, development aid support, and can also relate to medical care needs as i.e. blood or organs for transplant. Charitable gifts of goods or services are also called gifts in kind. The largest form of gifts in kind is created in many nations by the donation of aging automobiles with the item donated being picked up, sold and the proceeds given to the charity or non-profit (type or named) which was the target of the donor's generosity. One standard way of obtaining donations is the use of raffles for the accumulation of funds." - wikipedia
