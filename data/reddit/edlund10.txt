You have an error in the calculations: 1.2 Trillion (USD currently available) divided by 7.6 billion (population of the world) is $157.9 (per person in the world). 
Another smaller error is the fact that the USD currently available is 1.5 Trillion - 
A probably simpler calculation would be:
$16,844.50 (current BTC price) * 21 million (total future amount of BTC) =  $353.7345 billion (BTC market cap if all 21 million were mined)
$1500 billion (USD currently available) divided by $353.7345 billion (BTC market cap if all 21 million were mined) = 4.24 (the price of BTC should go up that much to equal the USD)
$16,844.50 (current BTC price) * 4.24 =  $71,428.57 (price of BTC)

Mining increases the gold supply by 1-2% annually. It is limited by physics. The world population also increases, which increases the demand for gold. Its supply can't be increased at the will of bureaucrats. 
SP500 includes 500 companies. When Facebook issued equity and was included in SP500, some other company was dropped. Its supply can't be increased at all. The guys from S&amp;P might one day include in the index only companies with negative earnings, but this is much less realistic than the FED printing more dollars.
The value of the dollar is constantly decreasing, at a stable rate. It affects savings greatly. This is why I'm surprised why somebody would put his savings into something, whose supply will double probably every 10 years.

If you had transferred your €1k to Bitstamp or Kraken, you could have bought 1000/460 = 2.17 BTC, instead of the 5 which you bought on Mt. Gox. You could have bet your 2.17 real BTC on Satoshi Dice for example, using the address which gives you your bitcoins back x2.670, and the probability of that happening is 36.6211%. So you would have had 2.17 * 2.67 = 5.7939 BTC with probability 36.6211%. If you think the probability of Mt. Gox not disappearing with your money is higher than ~45%, then your bet makes sense.

All of these things are cheaper now, if measured against gold or stocks. This is because prices drop when the supply increases. Since 1990 huge parts of the world started trading much more freely, producing much more efficiently, thus increasing the supply of many things. Since 1990 there has been enormous progress in car, computer, television, cell phone technologies. For sure there has been also progress in agriculture.
SP500 opened at $359.69 on January 3 1990. It is now $1914.31. It increased **5.32** times. The currency in circulation in January 1990 was $223.9 billion . Now it is $1199.8 billion. It increased **5.36** times.
1.07 (inflation) ^ 24.5 (years) = **5.25**
If cars, computers etc. today are not 5 times more expensive than they were in 1990, it's because of the human progress. If you put some money in SPY on January 1990, you would be able to buy now more cars and computers than back then, thus enjoying the human progress. If you put them in TIPS - I guess the result would be different.

The amount of printed dollars is increasing at about 7-8% per year. The prices of many things - too, including stock prices. You would be much better off buying some real assets, which will appreciate with 7-8% annually on average, instead of TIPS.

Inflation for me is increase of the money supply. The money supply for me is the amount of printed currency in circulation. Thus, for US dollars, the inflation has been 7-8% annually for a long time (for me). I expect it to continue, because the US government is running large deficits and it can repay its debts only through inflation. Maybe one day bitcoin will impose fiscal discipline on the US government, but I don't think it will be soon. 
The prices of some things don't increase that much or even drop (computers), because of the technological advances and the benefits coming from free trade, more competition (China) etc. Some people in Ukraine might be hoarding dollars, so the effects of money printing might not result in higher prices of apples in Chicago for some time. However, the Ukrainians are hoarding gold too, so i feel much more comfortable investing in gold than TIPS, because I expect gold to appreciate with 7-8% annually on average. The 7-8% newly printed dollars sooner or later find their way into the stock market, so buying stock index ETFs is also better than TIPS. I am not buying gold or stocks directly, but buying and rolling long-term call options on GLD and SPY. I have some proportion of my savings in bitcoin, because I expect them to appreciate much more than 7-8% annually + I'm doing some volatility trades, which don't depend on inflation :)
So, inflation for me is easy to determine from the Federal Reserve's statistics and I'm using them to determine my trading strategies - alternatives to buying TIPS. It has worked very good for me so far. 
The CPI is extremely subjective and I'm not really interested in it.

**How much do you believe the average cost of living is increasing?**
The average cost of living is decreasing, if measured not against the dollar, but against gold, stocks, оr bitcoin.
If measured against the dollar, the average cost of living is changing with different percentages at different places. It is very subjective. I don't live in the US, so all I care about are my dollar-denominated investment underlyings, which do increase with 7-8% annually. 
I don't care about the official CPI also in the country where I live. It's also very low, but the prices around me are increasing at about 7-8% per year, together with the currency in circulation.

**Again, source?**
My second link from my first reply to you.
**I take it you are unaware that most economists think that the CPI, if anything, overstates inflation.**
I take it you are unaware that most economists don't understand economy.
**Also, you should be using M2, the money actually circulating.**
*M2 consists of M1 plus: (1) savings deposits (which include money market deposit accounts, or MMDAs); (2) small-denomination time deposits (time deposits in amounts of less than $100,000); and (3) balances in retail money market mutual funds (MMMFs).*
I take it you consider deposits as "money". This means that the total allowed amount of bitcoins is not 21 mln., but is actually unlimited. The hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, which are currently deposited in exchanges, should be added to the amount of bitcoins in circulation, for example here - 
You can suggest this to the people from blockchain.info.

You can follow these instructions, I've tried them myself.
It's working. The "raw transaction" is a long string of hexadecimals. It contains information about the inputs and outputs of the transactions. It also shows whether the transaction was signed with the correct private key. You can re-sign the transaction as many times as you like, and the string of hexadecimals will change every time.
Before copying the raw transaction into  you can copy it into  There it will be decoded for you. You can check if the outputs are ok and only after you're comfortable with it, push it to the miners.

Bitcoin is backed by this:
*At first, the production of a commodity simply because it is costly seems quite wasteful. However, the*   **unforgeably costly commodity** *repeatedly adds value by enabling beneficial wealth transfers. More of the cost is recouped every time a transaction is made possible or made less expensive. The cost, initially a complete waste, is amortized over many transactions. The monetary value of precious metals is based on this principle. It also applies to collectibles, which are more prized the rarer they are and the less forgeable this rarity is. It also applies where provably skilled or unique human labor is added to the product, as with art.*

Hi Jesse,
Thanks for the reply. I like kraken.com in general, so I’m sorry I had to use reddit to get a reply. There is surely a need for transparent bitcoin exchanges.
Here is a link to an album with 4 screenshots from my internet banking and from kraken.com:
On 11/21 I sent 800 euro via SEPA to Kraken and there were no fees. On 11/28 I sent 500 euro by repeating the previous payment, only changing the amount. There was a 5 euro fee.
On 12/16 I sent euro from the same bank account, using the same settings, to Bitstamp and there were no fees. 
So from my point of view I shouldn’t contact my bank (I found out recently that they don’t support their customers trading bitcoins, so I’m leaving them anyway). If you can provide some proof that Fidor Bank credited your account with only 495 euro after my last transfer, I’ll believe you. The possibility that Fidor might be skimming your customers will remain.

Another important thing about the year 1975 - it was the year in which gold ownership was legalized for the mere mortals in the US:
*After the sale of gold was legalized in the United States, for the first time since 1933, on December 31, the U.S. Treasury conducted its first auction of a part of its gold reserves, setting aside an unprecedented 2,000,000 ounces for sale, in individual 400 ounce gold bricks, valued at $70,000 apiece based on the European market price of $175 an ounce.*

I think this is exactly what they're doing (buying them on Mt. Gox directly, not on bitcoinbuilder).
I guess that when BTC was trading at 10-20% premium on Mt. Gox, Karpeles and friends were buying cheap bitcoins on other exchanges and selling them to their customers, which couldn't withdraw fiat. 
Afterwards they decided to stop also BTC withdrawals, so now they're making money from everybody. They are taking fees from everyone trading there, and they can buy tons of cheap coins. 
The best thing is that they are not doing anything illegal. If somebody bought expensive coins there and sold them later very cheaply, Mt. Gox didn't break any laws. 
I'm pretty sure they are making lots and lots of millions without any risk of going to jail. If they aren't, they must be complete idiots, which they don't seem to be.

First of all - admiration for your work, it is impressive. 
Regarding holding private keys- have you looked at realitykeys? 
The guy has already moved to Ethereum, but he had a functioning model where he didn't hold private keys. He was revealing one private key in case of True and another one in case of False. Here is his example how this could work - 
And another, probably even simpler example is - put the bitcoins in a 2-of-3 multisig where you hold only 1 key, sign one transaction if True, another one if False.
