So far this is my ONLY way of getting coins. I have a guy who sells for market value. He lives on BTC , so when I come with 3,000$ usd he gladly sells. He is either a seller on a marketplace or a miner. He told me if I can continue with my meetings monthly because it gives him pocket money. Its a win/win for everyone.

I thought I did .  I copied it form my blockchain app but apparently when I copied and pasted in the program wickr , it decided to take the last letter away.

1Fxq4driAktYoWXiHz1WWfDA3g2c5WiYML was my wallet btw.

I dont keep much in my hot wallet. I use a cold wallet for my storage.

1Fxq4driAktYoWXiHz1WWfDA3g2c5WiYML  is the address it was SUPPOSED to be sent to . 1Fxq4driAktYoWXiHz1WWfDA3g2c5WiYM was entered. Blockchain will not allow it but btc-e let it go thru when it bounced back.

I've won over 50btc from bitzino. BTC was only in the low 10$'s though.
