Does anyone have a copy of thispaper  for us who hold BTC and can't afford to buy it?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:48:11
And with any currency.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:15:58
Because nobody ever got scammed with USD before, right? 
Yeah yeah I get what you're saying, but still... It makes me so pissed off this is what people take away from it. 
BIG BANKS are trying to KILL us. All of this is their manipulation, if you believe anything else you're deluded. This is where we stand or fall.

I wish I could have afforded not to sell. I'm extremely broke and held out to the last second, but I had to buy food.
Now I'm extremely broke AND have no food. The moral of the story is- bitcoin is a better investment than food.

I think we shouldn't discount third world countries, who are just starting to wake up to this brave new dawn, and realizing they can use it for 1) not pay taxes, 2) buy and sell illegal services, 3) hedge against rampant inflation and corruption, 4) do it from their cellphones.

This is definitely the biggest of my complaints. Paying $4 to send coin or risk having them stuck for days? Not cool with me. Love BTC. But not cool.

And all the hardware and digital infrastructure, there are a lot of people who aren't going anywhere, but yeah, the finance peeps have both the funds and the knowhow to chain us in their basement and rape us for a decade.
I am prepared to lose it all, it's decent cash and I would have to work it off for a while, but if things actually do hold up... Risk and high reward.

Why are you guys speaking in gibberish?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:07:42
Bubble or not bitcoin is not going anywhere. Could crash, but would eventually get back on its feet. Few things could kill it outright. Too many people are too heavily invested in too many ways.
Worst case scenario it falls back to being digital drug currency, which will be the engine moving it upwards again. Drugs are the true commodity behind BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:23:39

I did the math on that, and it shows conclusively that you would lose 50% of your investment or more.
Edit: Oh sorry, I saw now that you wrote "-50%". That would increase the value of your investment by 50%. Or more.
