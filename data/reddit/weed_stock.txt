@_date: 2019-11-25 16:19:46
Wow... thanks for this.
Honestly, my biggest issue with BTC currently is how fucking ANNOYING THE ROLLER COASTER MEME IS AFTER A 3% PUMP!
Like honestly, fuck off, if you're so new that you get erect from a 2 or 3% move, just take your 0.0002 BTC and dingle your own twat with it.
I for one joined this sub for actual BTC related info and news.
That roller coaster meme is fucking dead

My question too!  
I just picked up two mini pc’s for faster load times on charts.  Hoping they’re enough power.
Huge mistake not ordering from Amazon though... saved 60$ to wait for 2 months.  Just got them today.  Woulda paid $200 to get them fast.

Suitable when BTC is preparing to beast, but the 5% pumps are just pathetic for the roller guy.

@_date: 2019-08-28 12:56:47
I calibrated using the gold price history chart from 1970-2001 for both price and time.  I'm sure you've seen how similar that chart is to BTC.
Gold futures released at the top... ETF at the bottom.  Then moon.
My curve put BTC at $54000 by mid September.  But the price was coming up directly under my curve. 
I drew it in November or december though, and it was really striking.  (Just saw your "day of prophecy", man I think we made our charts here at the same time!! Hahaha)
Anyway, gonna be an interesting year buddy!

Well I medicate daily friend. ☺️
I don’t plan on ever selling my btc.
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:02:10
I disagree.
Roger Ver has actually contributed to making btc known to the masses.
He was out there in the very beginning spreading the word.
I don’t agree with his use of bitcoin.com website to mislead, but to say he’s worse than Craig Wright, either you’re an idiot or you’re new.
Wake the fuck up.
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:48:47
You obviously don’t know this, but people actually owned btc before bch was a thing.  
And Ver was there pumping the living shit our of BTC before BCH was a thing.
You can be as ignorant as you want, but Ver is probably part of the reason you ever learned about it in the first place.
Craig Wright is a fraud piece of shit.
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:28:08
It’s unreal that this even needs to be explained to the laymen still.

jesus, he’s just a man. 
apology for gender assumption
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:38:04
I loaded up at 4200 and then 3X more at 3600 .. as a noob.  
And as an impartial observer you must be on a lot worse than weed to have been in this longer with such far less of a clue it’s pretty sad.
I also made over 3000% buying CGC the morning our Liberals won the election.  So keep on keeping on your attacks based on user names.  
And then try to match those gains having as you say, buying btc at the top as Im sure you did.
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:45:30
Because you could use help knowing how to buy bottoms and time investments.
Clearly.  
If you ever wanna learn how to do that, gonna need to drop the dumb cunt being.
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:01:20
Jesus man, learn how to read. 
You just keep throwing words into Op’s mouth.


wtf ?? 
His first sentence said the traditional stock market may have a few years left.  And that the amount of USD debt is unsustainable and this house of cards is eventually going to fall in itself.
And he is bang on.  
Correct we call that in school when you learn and you are right.
At the very least, after a 10 year bull run we absolutely will be seeing a recession.
Where tf did he say crypto would replace stocks??  He said absolutely nothing of the sort.
Your thoughts arent even coherent.
It’s like arguing with a kid with downs.
Go finish grade 1 and learn about vowels before you come in here arguing about a concept you have zero fucking clue on.
You don’t even know shit about stocks.  And you’re ignorant as all hell. 
You will not be successful in any financial venture.

@_date: 2018-11-28 19:57:07
Absolutely!!  
You should be proud to be adding after a 80-85% correction. 
This is one situation where averaging down is a smart move.
That said, I do believe we will retest and possibly just break the 3400 support before starting up the mountain ...  just one little hill before we cross the river and never look back... imo.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:37:47
I think we will re-test the 3600 range after this little bump.  But my theory is if we do,  that will be where it takes back off.
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:46:09
Would be more accurate if it showed the loss of the supports, and entry into the river.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:07:45
You say that while the USD is at ATH’s.
We’ll see what happens at the first sniff of currency devaluation, or currency crisis.
You’re speaking as someone clearly complacent that the USD debt load is sustainable.
Bitcoin can remain where it is today, and eventually over time it will approach infinity as inflation slowly devalues all fiat over time.
Those are the fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:02:22
You’re one of the few that will ever buy below $5k.
These people beaking you’s children are going to puke when they tell their kids they balked at the suggestion a sub $4k BTC.
And that is why idiot parents transmit zero wealth to their next generation.
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:42:19
Ya, I don’t believe you have any capabilty to learn and my efforts would be hugely wasted.

@_date: 2018-11-26 00:57:47
Im in the bitcoin sub because Ive been following it for over a year.  My analysis was to wait for a break of the yearly charts supports just like gold did in the 90’s from its price history chart.  
Ive been waiting for this moment for a long time, and you’re damn right Im excited about it.   And I planned for it.  And I know exactly how much of my weed gains I will put into crypto.  
And I did buy CGC  the morning after our election.  And I sold my CGC in January this year and began day trading full time.  Ive rebroke my personal ATH’s everymonth.  I had one of my best weeks ever last week shorting on the SQQQ.  
Everyone laughed at me when I tried to warn them the nasdaq was going to tank last week.  They laughed when I said it would happen in the beginning of Oct too.
See idiots like you on these subs are exactly what gives me the info I need to remain contrarian, and profit.  
And there are thousands of you, for every one of me in the markets.  
But what does this say about you, hanging around in the bitcoin sub crying when you see others getting in when its smart to do so??
That my friend, is utterly pathetic. Utterly.
But that is one regard where you excel, see there are thousands of people less pathetic for every person as pathetic as you.
And yet,  I do wish you even remotest resemblance of the amount of success Ive had.
But that’s not going to happen.

(I have no kids currently)
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:00:26
Good moves.  I feel like we need another retest of the 3400 bottom for sure.  but could definitely see another flush down from there.
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:37:56
My bad, its macrotrends.net ... i updated my comment
Gold dropped 83% from when futures were introduced to the bottom, before the ETF.
Coincidentally enough, the values of gold were $2200 when btc was $20k at top.
The bottome was at $377 for gold ... we’re at $3600 for btc. 
Divide by 10 and even the values bear an uncanny resemblance.
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:07:16
Ya I hope so. 
I love the roller dude, but needs to come out when for real. 
4k isnt real.
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:28:03
I suggest you goto  and look at the gold price history chart.
The same thing happened to gold, and their charts are in fact identical.
In both instances, the futures contracts were introduced at the very top.  That drove price of gold down to the trough, then they introduced the gold ETF at the bottom, which skyrocketed the price of gold 3000%.  Same thing with BTC, futures were introduced 
That is where we currently are on the BTC chart. (After futures have driven down the price)
And the charts aren’t just similar, they’re identical.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:39:44
Thanks, but I invested in Canopy Growth the morning after the liberals were elected in Canada.   
I made over 3000% on my money.

Years from now, when you finally have money, once you’ve worked your first job, the you can decide how to spend your money.
The idea of a 19 year old with no research into bitcoin telling someone who trades stocks for a living that they don’t know what they’re doing with their money is pathetically laughable.
Go get your grade 10 before you start giving financial advice.
Edit: Yes I did just buy my first bitcoin.  I also sold it when we broke 4085 support, and rebought at 3800.
I bought on an over 80% dip.  Maybe if you’d open you eyes you could learn a thing or 2.
Also, keep trolling my post history.  That’s when you know you’re fucking cool.

I wonder what the fees are?
I saw a Coinstar machine as I just so happened to have a box of change. 
They wanted like a 20-30% fee or some shit to convert the coins.  
Not a fucking chance.  Bought the coin rollers and took em to bank myself.

@_date: 2018-11-28 19:02:11
Absolutely.  I day trade stocks for a living so understand that I would never let it get to that point with regular holding.
And Im not even close to where I intend to be with BTC, I plan on adding quite a bit more yet.
If it dropped to $2k I would be very comfortable quadrupling my BTC holdings there... at least.
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:54:14
Don’t get me wrong, it’s exciting.
But ya could have waited for the neckline of the head and shoulders to break!!
It still could, we literally jammed right upto it here.  But that will be exciting, and possibly more called for roller guy. 
I don’t mean to be too hard on ya here, some pps are def over reacting.  I just wanna see real moves!

My plan as well.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:22:19
Waited over a year to spot this moment! 
I used the gold history chart to know these supports had to break, or else I would buy when 9k rebroke.  If it holds true we should see a decent rebound here, then a re test witha  possibility of losing the support, which is ~3400 there. 
Ive got over another 50% to add in that spot, once Im sure we are in fact climbing back other side of hill.
Exciting, exciting times.

@_date: 2019-09-07 15:35:05
I've never seen so many useless idiotic comments from losers who can't perform TA, therefore it MUST not work.
I've made a career out of technical analysis.
Don't listen to people who have never succeeded in anything in life, about how to go about yours. 
TA had me buying my BTC in November/December at ~$3600. 
What you have in BTC here is a new asset class, and a lot of people who have gotten lucky.  
Same can be said for anyone that started financial industry careers in the last 10 years.  
They accept the fact that they've gone 10 whole years in the industry making clients money, therefore they must be good.  
That's what everyone in these comments "Redditors for 3 months" bullshit sounds like.  Not being but lucky losers.
Wait til those financial industry professionals get hit with a real down cycle.  10 years of experience and they've never had one.  You can't be good until you have that experience. 
TA lets you go back in time and see the conditions that allowed for such economic downturns.  And if anyone tried telling you it's only good for thenpast, and not the future, then they suck at what they do and you shouldn't listen to them.
Also ask them how the fuck I bought BTC at $3600 this winter.  How I bought TSLA at $178 a few months ago.  And why I just bought CGC back this week.  
Don't take your advice from lucky losers who suck and can't comprehend TA.
At the same time, ppl thinking TA is magical bullshit means my job is SECURE.

Well shit, I was just about to buy some BTC too.
@_date: 2019-09-07 15:23:27
This is the stupidest thing I've ever read.
Maybe just take it as a sign that it's not for everyone, and it sure is shit ain't for you.
Because you're not any good at it.  Not because it doesn't work. 
Also it's the opposite dipshit.  The more people that use TA makes it become a self fulfilling prophecy, not the other way around.

If any whale’s a are dumping BTC, that is great for BTC long term.  
So many people that have been on the crypto sidelines are now starting to pour in. 
Small amounts, sure, but again, that is great for BTC long term.

Well put! Cheers

Respectfully disagree.  
Allowing coinbase (or anyone or exchange) custody of your keys of any BTC you’re not currently trading is just as bad as keeping your keys on the MTGOX exchange.
Zero difference.
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:24:33
Yea I wonder.  They are being sold for 4970 or whatever as well, so it’s not like you’re buying for that and only able to sell for 4500 right away.  
Unless they reverse fist you for 4500 if you try to go back to CDN and withdrawl..

Everyone else is not savvy ! Thats why!
You’re damn right 0.1 BTC will be significant in the future.
One thing people do not seem to consider is that BTC is already an amalgam of every world currency.
And as the USD has been gaining value in the last few years against other world currencies, this gives an “illusion” of deflation simply because we are considering a time frame of increasing strength for the USD.
This is absolutely not sustainable, and the very first sniff of USD weakness will see astronomical gains in BTC. 
BTC could remain stagnant from here, and as other world currencies begin to devalue (but more so WHEN the USD begins to devalue), then even with a constant BTC, the price will approach infinity as other fiat eventually goto 0.
Im of the opinion that in the future, every country’s economy will be in BTC, and at that point BTC value will be tied to the World’s GDP.
It will barely fluctuate, but will do so according to natural GDP contraction and expansion of the countries that use it. 
Probabaly getting off topic here, but congrats on your coin !
I was just getting ready to do another dollar cost average for another 1.5 BTC today, and bam fucking thing breaks out!! Damnit! haha

Only destroy at the top.
It could have the opposite effect from the bottom.
