Sorry that's not how it works at all. Those who invest early in disruptive technologies are literally providing financial support for the further development and use of those technologies and have in fact been essential in creating the value that eventually is recognized and causes their stake to increase in purchasing power. Nobodies wealth is being siphoned away when someone takes a bar of gold and invests it in a business or technology. Inflation is literally stealing your stored value and redistributing it to the FED who uses it to prop up otherwise unsustainable markets. 
Those who invested early in Bitcoin were essential for creating the value we recognize today. Same for internet, railroads, and other disruptive industries. Without the early investors these technologies would not be here today and those investors are rewarded with value freely by individuals who see the value in their creation. The value is not stolen from anyone whereas inflation is theft.

What do your parents have to do with this? Do you think everyone has access to the opportunities that allow you to be independent? The inequality in opportunity is a privilege. Some people in western countries squander their privilege; but many don't have access to these opportunities that allow them to thrive in the fist place.
Top down economic mismanagement has killed tens of millions of people throughout history. The market is a natural phenomenon; not something you can control with levers and switches. The best you can do is create inefficiencies but often leads to humanitarian crises and mass starvation. I'd rather people lose their jobs now and find ways to provide for themselves and their families than continue this unsustainable culture and create another billion people that we can't possible provide for

Not at all. Maxwell is hardly analogous to Vitalik in terms of control over Bitcoins direction. He's had some great contributions but in no way is a leader of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:53:43
You are thinking of Bitcoin as a product ; it's a revolutionary monetary protocol. It can't and shouldn't change to whatever fanciful whims users might have today and then change another day for others whims. If this means Bitcoin isn't useful for you right now that's completely fine ; I'd rather Bitcoin be here to disrupt and replace global finance over the next 10years. Changing the protocol for short term needs might increase the price significantly; but just makes Bitcoin more vulnerable to attack. Bitcoin has been and will continue to be attacked ; security and decentralization must be protected at all costs. You can get back into Bitcoin when it suits your needs ; but Bitcoin is not going to change for the flavor of the week

It's not that it would be obvious Vitalik would be destroying the system. It would be in the form of pushing the project in a direction that would make it easier for governments and banks to take control of. People generally trust him and he has way too much influence to call ethereum decentralized.

Yes; if you aren't living paycheck to paycheck you are privileged. This is exactly the kind of disconnect I expect with self proclaimed economists. The vast majority of the planet lives paycheck to paycheck; including most Americans. 
You don't understand the privileges that enable your lifestyle and you clearly don't understand the state of personal economics most people and most families that live and work in this world are subject to. It is exactly this kind of insulated privilege that leads to bad economic policy. You've lived entirely on the side of the equation that benefits from stealing from the poor and you of course don't understand their plight and continue advocating that they are stolen from while you enjoy the luxury of investing saved labor in superior stores of value.
Your economic theories have cost millions of people their lives; multiple times throughout history and even today. It is honestly despicable that you promote these opinions as fact an unironically proclaim that they are necessary and good when history and current reality has proven your opinion to be murderously dangerous 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:55:03
Despite your hand waving ; inflation is a simple tool to steal from the poor and give to the rich. As you say it encourages investment away from dollars; which is fine for those who have excess wealth. They can take advantage of investing their money and typically hold very little fiat. The poor and working class don't often have enough excess fiat to make investments. So whole their wages stick ; inflation ticks away. 
This whole idea of monetary policy having any positive effect on the global economy is a circle jerking farce. Economists only believe this because they haven't completely destroyed the economy with their fetish for the illusion of control. They haven't been able to destroy the economy only because we have been living through the greatest increases in productivity humanity has ever witnessed. 
What they don't tell you is that every fiat currency has ended in ruin on average in 20years. Destroying the savings and lives of all those foolish enough to drink the koolaid . The oldest fiat in the world is only 100years old; the great British pound. The oldest money in the world is gold and is still recognized as money today ; even without being backed by a government. 
Economies don't need economists to run ; economists are a threat to a healthy free market. All they do is create inefficiency and suffering. Look at Venezuela; look at Zimbabwe; look at history . History is full of examples of economies being mismanaged from the top down leading to famine and suffering . Read the fucking wealth of nations 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:04:17
With the value of your saved labor going up combined with decreased availability of loans; it will be much easier to live a full life without taking on any debt . If mortgages didn't exist homes would approach the cost of construction ; and if construction financing doesn't exist ; the cost of construction falls enormously as well. Homes would be 80-90% less in price compared to today. In a deflationary world you would never get credit for nonprofit based ventures like owning a home . 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:39:15
You are suggesting that theft is necessary for the market to function properly and that makes me despise people like you. 
Just think for a minute about this encouragement to invest that fiat causes. You want people to spend their saved labor when they wouldn't otherwise in order to retain some value. Those that are privileged enough to have extra to invest already dump their fiat for things like real estate (which makes it even more expensive for the working classes). This doesn't stimulate the economy in a healthy way ; it exacerbates the boom and bust cycle. 
The privileged have easy access to ways of dumping their fiat for less inflationary or deflationary assets ; while the poor and working class rely on wages which as an economist you should know are sticky. 
Inflation is a tool to steal from the poor and deliver to the rich. I find it despicable that people will openly promote such pathological policies and simply repeat these asinine talking points. Deflation is healthy and natural ; people will always spend on housing ; food; transport; entertainment; etc. they will spend less; and there will be less wasteful use of resources.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:04:36
If you are equating experts in industry and science to "experts" in economics or political science then you are deluded. Economics is political philosophy wrapped up in the cloak of science. It is nothing more than opinion based on underlying philosophy. When these opinions fly in the face of the free market people starve on massive scales. Your beloved fiat has walked humanity to the edge of a cliff that we have no choice but to go off; and you'll blame Bitcoin and gold and deflation after your ilk have driven our world into such an unsustainable state ; and you won't even realize your role in promoting the very politics that is destroying this planet and what is left of our humanity

With 8mb blocks they actually can't fit significantly more transactions unless fees rise to the same levels on bch. Right now bch tx are about 5x larger (in byte size) than btc transactions ; so until fees rise on bch there is no incentive to reduce tx size and it really can't process significantly more tx than btc; until its fees rise ; which kind of defeats the purpose of centralizing bch and destroying its security model for low fees if it doesn't accomplish that. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:24:50
So most people work for $2 a day because they choose to or because they don't have access to the same opportunities as you? I'm not saying the world should be 100% equal; but if you can't recognize the vast inequality with respect to access to resources , education, and job opportunities then you are blind to the plight of the world and a perfect example of privilege.

Ethereum is controllable through vitalik. If he is threatened by governments to covertly destroy ethereum ( or make changes favorable to governments/banks) he can either resist and be jailed or otherwise punished. Eth having a leader makes it corruptible; quite easily . This has happened many times to alternate currencies in the past when they have not been sufficiently decentralized. Bitcoin transactions are valuable because it is the only currency network that has proven itself to be truly uncontrollable. Most other coins have leaders; poor mining distribution ; no fees to ensure the reward schedule can be kept deflationary; etc. Ethereum is a cool project and I'm invested ; but it is NOT money. Bitcoin is money and no other coin even comes anywhere close. Once the dust settles 99% of alts will die
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:07:49
Another way to put it is inflation siphons value from those who have worked hard and saved frugally and transfers to those who have not saved. Deflation is the natural state of affairs. More goods and services  are produced everyday and the value of your labor in the past should be worth more today than it was yesterday due to accumulation of true human created wealth on this planet . The only reason it is not is because rampant inflation steals the value of your past labor. Deflation steals from nobody ; inflation steals from everyone with inflatable currency  and the poor typically have a greater % of their wealth in fiat than the wealthy

The cap is completely irrelevant. Mining could go on for 1000 years without reaching the cap if we just increase the number of decimal places. 
Every 4 years approx miners revenue in Bitcoin is reduced by 50% it doesn't matter if it goes from 12 to 6 BTC or .01 to .005 BTC ; the economics are the same at each halving.
The fee market will grow to become the main revenue stream for miners over time; and then the reward subsidy will truly not matter
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:21:51
But a lower difficulty and hash rate makes this easier. If bcash had 7% of the hashrate and 7% of the difficulty of Bitcoin it could be 51% attacked with only ~7% of the btc hashrate. Lower difficulty and hashrate is reduced security

This is a great way to lose your privacy to coinbase since they will now know your transaction history if you aggregate all your btc in one address and then add some new coinbase coins to help split. So you are trading whatever is left of your privacy for free coins

I've followed a very similar strategy since 2014. I was down 79% at one point but kept to my plan and I am so happy that I didn't stop those auto buys. Past doesn't predict the future but that has been my experience. Still following my plan and buying regularly

Miners are always selling to cover costs. This is a constant downward pressure on price to the tune of approx 4% per year. At next halving it will be slightly below 2% . This will not only reduce downward pressure on price ; but will be lower than the targeted inflation rate of most fiat currencies. This should cause the price of Bitcoin to almost always be rising by a small amount simply because from that point on fiat will inflate faster and faster in comparison to Bitcoin. Demand stays the same supply of Bitcoin decreases relative to supply of fiat. Many believe this could be a watershed moment

The widespread use of credit is what causes people to need debt to make large purchases. Without credit and debt almost everything would be 90 to 99% less expensive in dollar terms. Though wages would also be much lower; overall the average person would do better without credit.

The difficulty is readjusted every 2016 blocks ; difficulty goes up when the average time is less than 20160 minutes to find those blocks. Hashrate can only be determined retrospectively by looking at how quickly blocks are mined. Are you saying that the average time to mine 2016 blocks is not consistent with the difficulty adjustments or just that misleading hashrate chart? Hashrate can not actually be measured.

You seem to be missing the point that these things would be much more affordable without the existence of credit. You needed credit because credit is available. Do you really think people would not buy homes or cars or start businesses if there was no credit? 
Loans with a 100% reserve does not cause this problem ; that kind of credit will always exist and is necessary. I'm talking about bank credit; where the credit is created from the down payment. This credit is harmful to the average person and pretty much everybody who is not endowed with the power to create money out of debt.
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:03:58
The power consumption and cost is actually part of Bitcoins security model. Bitcoin mining trends to 0% margins meaning that the price of a Bitcoin is very close to the energy costs to mine it. This doesn't hold during quick spikes and crashes but tends o hold true over the long run. If it ever costs significantly less to mine a btc vs buying it then more people would mine driving up the energy consumption of the network. Difficulty adjusts then back to equilibrium.
Asking for Bitcoin to require less power is exactly the same thing as asking for a lowered value per Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:08:09
The average person is not the people that get the main advantages of credit and debt. That would be the creditors. The average person would be far better off in a world without credit and debt. Credit inflates prices and centralizes wealth in the hands of those allowed to create credit.

Why the fuck do people own Bitcoin rather than bank money? This isn't just some big get rich quick scheme. This is world changing technology and you are trying to argue that one of the core reasons Bitcoin has value is not valuable.

That is just astoundingly ignorant of the vast number of hacks and inside jobs by these online Bitcoin wallets. 
It is not your Bitcoin in any way if you don't have the keys. You are being ignorant of the differences between Bitcoin and fiat. 
If you have "Bitcoin" in a web wallet or other service where you don't have the private key you literally don't own Bitcoin; you own fiat or an IOU
Bitcoin is the power to move funds in the blockchain with public key cryptography. Numbers in web wallets are just IOUs. This is not a theoretical argument; hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BTC have been lost due to ignorance like you own.

Yup this is extremely normal for Bitcoin. This is just some noise and price finding behavior. Anything could happen in this market though like most I believe we are extremely upward bound in the long run. Short term price could go to $1000 or less.
