No, a logo must be recognizable in a square of 2cm² or on a surface of 50m². When it's printed in small, people will only see a numpad icon.

You don't have to be sad. You've made a lot of money. And it's never too late to reinvest. If you've earned money, it's a victory never forget.

No, because average ppl will think the bitcoin crashed. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:46:38
It feels good.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:21:53

Yes we need a sacrifice go for it. Sell all and tomorrow it's will be back at $16.000
Seriously boys it's a -35% dip. Everything's gonna be fine.
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:18:43
Telling you own $250K of BTC + putting photos of your face. Good plan OP.
Edit: Oh wow your BTC are on Robinhood. Haha great move too.... omg.
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:28:27
They should ask his wife, she looks she knows how to invest also.
@_date: 2019-10-05 09:44:44
Yes and no. You can't freeze accounts with Btc.
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:38:24
Ah yes the bretzel language.

I'm sorry but he's an idiot.
1. All in &lt;- idiot
2. Trading with his emotions &lt;- idiot
He just says it : "I'll hold one year". And after 3 days he panics, sell &amp; buy an alt crypto he doesn't know.
full retard sorry. But glad he tells the story for the naabs
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:35:36

Same for me (less days than you)
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:29:24
Buy and hold until I can buy a house with it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:51:39
Can you buy a mansion with your BTC?
- No  → Hold
- Yes → Sell
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:56:58


It's like asking on if the iPhone is a good product.


Don't use coinbase the fees are to high, **NEVER** store your bitcoin on a website. Use a trezor or a paper wallet.

*Bitcoins are going to be another dot com bubble burst and they will crash to $1 per bitcoin by the end of 2016.*
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:28:27
Just the tip
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:10:14
I don't think you understand what an exchange is.
Exchange != Wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:37:09
What do you suggest ?
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:40:23
Why ? 
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:43:52
Bitcoin could reach $11000 if I touch my nipple
@_date: 2019-09-21 07:35:46
Nothing really to understand OP just want to show us his graph. 
You could see a patern and its look like BTC will moon soon  . But you understand what you want and draw your conclusions.
@_date: 2019-09-21 10:33:12
[Yes... yes](
@_date: 2019-09-21 08:36:45
I think I see what I want to see. I'm not an expert, if I were one, I'd be in the Bahamas with my 1.000BTC. But here I'm browsing Reddit in my underwear eating kellog's.
You may be right, I may be right or we're both wrong.

Put the direct link, don't advertise your Twitter...

@_date: 2019-05-23 14:56:24
And what if you want to sell all of your btc ?
Its 2017 you made it BOOM: $100.000. How are you supposed to cash it? If you sell only little by little $100-$200. the time you reach $100.000 you'll not have $100.000 worth of btc anymore (hello 2018).
