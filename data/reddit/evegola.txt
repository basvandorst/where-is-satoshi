My friend had a very bad experience with KRAKEN EXCHANGE.
He woke up Last Sunday to having his account emptied.
Kraken was or is of very little help. Krakens answer to everything is "phishing". He asked for IP trail and info on all the log ins. He was ingnored. 
If Kraken is so sure to quickly say "phishing" then why not provide paper work to their clients.
Kraken since has changed their policy but of course my friend LOST ALL HIS MONEY WITH KRAKEN.

KRAKEN admits to lacking security but still refuses to pay my friend back.
On August 16th his account was cleared out. Two days later Kraken changed their security-THUS ADMITTING TO HAVING OR RATHER LACKING SECURITY.
DON'T DO IT!

YES, HAD PRIVATE WALLET !
Kraken does NOTHING TO HELP once you have been hacked.
They try very hard not to respond to any complaints or inquiries

Beware of using Kraken. Their lack of customer support is evident not to mention your $$$ is not safe.

Dear Eve
We changed our police to help make our client's accounts more secure. So far the change has been working well. I can't comment on your friends account / situation. He will need to speak to one of our agents.
Kraken Client Engagement
The above was an email sent by Kraken after AUGUST 14TH, 2016. August 14 is when my friend started complaining that he woke up to an empty account even though he had everything set-up per Kraken's policy.
It's obvious they changed their security policy BECAUSE it was lacking. Kraken is famous for blaming their clients for not having secure accounts. Laughable crap !
I have many more email exchanges.

this is Kraken security issue. right after August 14th , Kraken changed their security policy on how currency is being transferred.
Obviously they acknowledge their site is NOT SECURE.

Typical Kraken answer to always blame the client.
If Kraken is so secure why did they change their policy RIGHT AFTER AUGUST 14TH to make is secure.
Why would this not be in place prior to August 14th.
I have a letter from Kraken stating their security/ policy was changed.

Kraken, 
Again you are blaming your customers for lack for security on your part !
do the right thing and help him out. On August 14th, he woke up to an empty account. He had all the security  steps and confirmation of it from you via email.
a day or so later Kraken changed their security and policy because clearly it was LACKING AND NOT PROTECTING CUSTOMERS.
