if i hodl-ed my loss might be something about 60%. I sold on the way down from 15K and bought back 3 times when we were at 10K and 7K

why does he need to provide seed words somewhere? can't he just give all the seed words to the person?
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:02:53
bought on the way up, missed the ATH and sell on the way down, been buying back little by little

May I ask, what is actually the reason these wallets doesn't make this option more easily accessible?
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:07:29
I bought at about 17k. Pulled out more than half when it goes down and been DCA-ing. So far I'm losing about 35%, not so bad since I think I'm one of the major FOMO victims when I buy. lol 
My advice would be to stay objective, HODL would be good if you can actually take your mind of it for years, but if you can't then try and plan it out instead of holding onto blind faith that the next bullrun will come soon. BTC will still be there for years to come, let's just enjoy the ride (hopefully to the moon and beyoond!)

"insurance". I think OP needs to check out the definition of it...
@_date: 2018-06-20 04:37:01
I think that won't be a problem. Just like a floppy disk isn't actually relevant anymore, nevertheless it is iconic as a "save" icon

This is a really good point and need more upvotes. All systems built usually started with good intentions, scale it up and implement it for a while and people start to look for and create loopholes. System that stands the test will evolve, adapt, and may very well grow into a whole different thing when compared to the original form. those which failed to detect its own flaws and respond accordingly usually ended in a revolution, replaced by a new system built upon good intentions not to repeat their past mistakes. and so does the cycle goes on, I still believe it's a upward spiral though, hopefully we as mankind never stop the struggle and always strive to be better over time.

I feel you man. I stopped talking about crypto to my friends after I realize how indifferent they are about something that's in the distance and have nothing to do with their life. Nobody said I'm an idiot or anything, it's just people have "real things" they have to deal with instead of talking about this magic internet money. 
I ended up in reddit and finally found a place to talk about it without being ignored, even the buttcoin sub is fun to visit once in a while, so thank you guys

no movement at all on google trends, seems like FOMOs from fresh money is not coming yet. guess the jump wasn't big enough to create something as big as late 2017 run?

Count me in! I mostly do more conventional graphic stuffs e.g illustrations, logo, and icons, may not help much but I'm down to help with anything I can do, even if just to provide feedbacks and make the space merrier :D

I think DMI is an ERC-20 token. from the news, I assumed they will not allow any other crypto in. it's basically a disneyland using token as ticket for rides
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:12:54


by definition, this is a failed hodl-ing. hodl is not caring about the price movement and choose to just hold until it's profitable **no matter how long** it takes (based on the belief that it will be profitable one day). even if it turns out to be gone to 0 you don't sell. that's the mentality. it might be less profitable than correctly timing the market, but that's the whole idea, you may not agree, but I believe this is easily understood?
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:02:12
you would get a better response asking about it at r/cryptocurrency,
 this sub hates r/btc and vice versa
@_date: 2019-05-10 04:05:10
this! let's just all agree to do this to make sure it stays under the radar until it's "too big to fail"
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:27:33
that's actually true tho, go to r/CryptoTechnology if you actually want to give a shit about the tech
@_date: 2019-05-01 09:39:42
I believe DMI is not even a coin, it's an ethereum token
