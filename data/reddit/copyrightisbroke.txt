Of course someone that uses Bitcoin knows what the issues of Bitcoin are, he doesn't need the Drama around it.  But at the same time, if you just deny/ignore the issues, they are not going to fix themselves.

coinbase make strange decisions all the time... it made sense to support it from the start since bitcoin cash is more like bitcoin is supposed to be then the future modified bitcoin that doesnt include all transactions in the blockchain

You also should have fought SegWit ...

Right now it still can... And the way storage costs keep getting lower and transfer speeds keep increasing, it probably will in the future too:

send me 0.1 bitcoin from that address so that I can verify that there was actually 950btc in that wallet

Segwit 1.0 should also be considered unnecessary and possibly harmful to what bitcoin stands for (it basically breaks the blockchain because information is now missing from it).

Have you been ~~to chinatown~~ [on Amazon](

Too bad it doesn't say Litecoin anywhere....
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:02:55
yeah, you can't trust that guy
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:38:45
probably as ridiculous as it sounds

When I was 15 years old, 20 years ago, I thought that the internet couldn't be regulated..... that dream was crushed.

would not be the first thing that doesn't make sense

Look here: 
lots of good info

M means 1,000 in Roman.... 1,000 * 1,000 = 1,000,000

that's the main problem with bitcoin now it seems... satoshis are not meant to be used, I guess...
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:59:10
with the bitcoin deflation, you will be rich in no time (well, maybe a few years)
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:36:12
Coinbase never planned very well... they used to cancel orders when they didn't like the bitcoin price drops
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:34:30
if 2x is an upgrade, 8x should have been an upgrade (bitcoin-cash)... Segwit was just a power grab
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:43:30
what does the other side look like?
