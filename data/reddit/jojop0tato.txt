Bro, I feel you. I mined 50 blocks of BTC on a laptop back in the day. I spent 100 BTC just gambling in the early days. Much later I cashed out between $5 and $20. It tore me up watching BTC rise, but I got over it. Shit happens, no one can tell the future. Now I get to claim a small part of BTC history as my own.

You get the price when you place the order.

Just bought back in for a half a bitcoin after many years coin-free. It's a teeny tiny fraction of what I had back in the day, but it's a start! This time I will hold on to them until I can retire off the damn things. I figure if BC has survived this far, it isn't going to die. Just don't tell me what 2,500 bitcoins would be worth today, I might die. Panic sellers beware.
Is it safe to leave bitcoins in a Coinbase wallet? I remember the MtGox debacle and it's made me wary of online bitcoin services.

Thanks, I'll look into that!

I recently asked a similar question and got a great suggestion from He suggested I pick up a [Trezor]( It's a hardware wallet, which is even more secure than a wallet on your desktop PC. If you are buying more than one Bitcoin, this is the way to go. It's a small price to pay to protect your investment.

I mined 2500 when they were worth fractions of a penny each. After squandering 400btc on gambling, I later sold the remaining 2100btc at 5-15 bucks each. Total profit was probably around 20k. Now I have one btc to my name. 
I would be willing to bet that MOST of us very early adopters already cashed out the majority of their coins, which I think is a good thing overall. It spreads the wealth and allows for more actual utility of btc. More btc volume is just more proof of value imo. 
Or mabe I'm just full of shit and trying to justify why I'm not worth 2.1 million right now lol.
Edit: spelling

I just picked up a [Trezor]( on Amazon. It's a dedicated piece of hardware that functions as a Bitcoin wallet. Much more secure than storing on your phone or PC!

Thanks man, obviously I don't have the 2500btc anymore, but I'd still like to secure what I have. Any suggestions for better ways to store them? I've been out of the game for a while, I don't know what's going on these days.
And yeah 2mill =( I mean, I still made something like 20k off of them, but damn is it hard not to be salty about selling so early. It was a valuable lesson for sure!

Trezor generates a recovery seed. You want to keep that safe and sound.

Bro I mined 50 blocks back in the day on my little Lenovo Laptop when I was a teenager. 2500 coins, all sold or gambled between 5-20 a piece. I was young and it was more money than I knew what to do with, so of course it was all gone in a couple of years. The only thing I have left of those coins is the gaming pc I built with a fraction of the profit.
This shit happens, and you gotta move on when it does. No one can tell the future, everyone makes bad calls at some point. I learned so much from that experience about the value of money, the importance of planning for the future, and how to handle the feeling of monumental loss.
As insane as it sounds, I have no regrets. It was a lesson I needed to learn. I can proudly say I am a better person today than I would be if I still had 5 million worth of BTC.
