It did come off a bit "scammy".

Indeed, I haven't removed the stickers but I have looked up all the partial codes to check how much are still on them. They are all still 1 bit coin each. They where given to me when they were worth 45ish USD

Noob question. I have a hand full of caucus coins that where gifted to me last year and I want to turn into digital. I have been waiting over a week for mtgox.com to register my new account and I already created a Coinbase wallet. Is there a quicker way to convert my physical coins to digital? 
My end goal is to sell the coins for USD. Thanks in advance!

Thank you so much for the advice today. I have been waiting about 9 days for my mt gox account to be prepossessed but nothing yet. 
"converted twice from SHA256&gt;Hex&gt;Base58" is a bit over my head. I will wait and hope that bit coin prices hold there value for a few more days. Really, at lease I would like to spend one coin on a new egg or amazon gift card and enjoy an awesome x-mas then hold out on the rest in hopes that bitcoins to jump 1000+

"Hm, that doesn't appear to be the proper format. Please check for typos."
The code does not work :(

I have looked and searched for an import method. Do I need a different type of account to "import". Also, if you have a link to the area, that would be cool.
