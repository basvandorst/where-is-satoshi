Can you give some specific examples? It kind of sounds like you took a distributed systems class and now just making up random bullshit.

Is it possible to figure out why it was reverted? Is some kind of justification needed to edit or revert things? Whatever justification was given for reverting the US dollar entry should be used to revert the Bitcoin entry.

TL;DR: bitcoin is not a company
@_date: 2012-11-15 22:18:38
I tried doing that, and as I said it only gives me 10 pages of transaction history. 
How do I get the full history is my question?
And where is this API that you speak of?

Looked promising, but actually it doesn't work. Also, something about this site is a little weird. I can't put my finger on it, just a gut feeling.

Or, or and or or?

* Has the experience been worthwhile financially? 
* What kind of capital is needed? What kind of profit are we talking about? 
* If it's win-win-win... then why isn't everyone doing it?
* What language did you use to write your bot?
* How time-critical are the trades? How reliable is your bot in this respect?
I am very interested to know more. Background: I am a grad student in EE/CS. I would love to get involved in something like this, for my own amusement more than anything, but if its makes me some money, then all the better.

I guess the way I see it is, I have a bunch of money and I am prepared to gamble. Now the question is not whether or not it's a good idea to gamble, but whether investing in Bitcoin is a more intelligent and calculated gamble than simply putting it all on red.

Yeah, I never quite enjoyed reading speculation on reddit. I do enjoy wasting my time lurking the speculation boards at bitcointalk! But I come here for big news and objective discussion.
@_date: 2012-11-29 18:41:14
Lots of butthurt idiots here who don't know how to read terms and conditions. If you don't like their policies, don't use their fucking service. 
Calling the world's biggest BTC exchange a "scam" is in the same league of bullshit as calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme.

What exactly do you want to be anonymous? If you transfer Dwolla funds to Mt. Gox and then buy bitcoin that is not anonymous. But you can then transfer the funds to a blockchain.info wallet and then do a zero-taint transfer to another wallet. Now it's anonymous (someone please correct me if I'm wrong).
@_date: 2012-08-23 05:49:40
Yeah, you read it pretty well. I am a grad student, just trying to get in and out, maybe double up on a couple of k. I mean, of-course we don't know what's going to happen. But I would be kicking myself if Bitcoin hit the headlines with this new debit card and the price went through the roof.
@_date: 2012-11-16 02:51:06
Interesting, thanks. I have no idea what I'm looking at there, but this is the kind of format I was looking for, I will look into it.
@_date: 2012-09-27 04:43:20
Yep. Clicked link to find Arduino BTC mining prototypes. Was very disappointed. WTF is this shit...
@_date: 2012-10-30 21:41:20
Yeah I was just thinking that. If we can get the same people that jumped on the KONY2012 bandwagon to embrace bitcoin, we would be in business. BTC2013 anyone?
@_date: 2012-09-20 03:54:08
I would say that it's not that elaborate and it's not a con.

Green means the time period closed at a higher value than it started. Red means the opposite. Note that these are not absolute measures, it depends on the time period in question. Within each green bar, smaller bars (i.e. shorter time periods) may be green or red, but the entire period is the aggregate, e.g. if you consider the time period of the entire chart in the picture as one big bar, it would be a green bar.

Can you give a rough ballpark of how much gains you have made? Where have these gains come from? In particular, how much revenue does SatoshiCircle bring? Understand if you don't want to disclose figures -- order of magnitude would be fine.

Please make this the new Bitcoin "aliens guy" meme. He deserves internet fame for his performance.

Weird that it was covered by a 3rd party website. I guess they made some kind of press release and got through the filter.
Site looks so dodgy. No specifications other than physical dimensions and GH/s. No information about the company, product, etc. 
That is fucked up.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:44:25
I am confused. I thought Satoshi was a mythical character? Or is it that there is a person called Satoshi, but we don't know who or where he is? Does he post using Tor?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:35:49


It's a free internet. People can say whatever they want, it's your job to use judgment and common sense to decide if that advice is good or not. The thing is that is a little bit more serious than bitcointalk speculation boards. I come here for major news, protocol discussion, security updates, etc. For example, when the fork happened, provided a concise and technical explanation while keeping all the bullshit to a minimum.
This is also why I love the speculation boards. You know that it's full of speculation and so you take it with a grain of salt. But it does give a good idea of sentiment, and it's just fun to see what people think without having to preface everything with "in my opinion" and defend every bit of speculation as such. It is exactly as advertised: a place where people state opinion as fact, and conversation flows freely.
The point is there is nothing wrong with giving out advice, stating opinion as fact, being emotional and polarizing, expressing your views, hopes and fears. It all adds up to give an indication of sentiment, which is a huge part of any market. The problem is that there is a place and a context for it, and people need to be discerning about what they read, and how they make use of information that they receive.

What is the unit of difficulty order (M/G/T) on that website?
By entering whatever I could figure out I get about 8 BTC per day. Is that the right ballpark?
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:00:57
Thanks. The spins don't really paint a complete picture because we don't know what the average bet is. Could you give an order of magnitude estimate (i.e. how many zeros in the daily revenue)?
I ask because a friend and I are thinking of setting up a similar business (with different games) and we are putting together a cost analysis.
