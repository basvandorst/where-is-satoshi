TBH the existence of Bitcoin itself means that any collapse of the dollar would not have nearly the negative impacts it would normally have had when the population wouldn't be able to (mostly) seamlessly switch to a better, harder currency.
We saw this in Cyprus already when they tried to do a bail in and it failed partially due to the amount of people buying Bitcoin to avoid it.

They will certainly try to kill Bitcoin

It's literal theft.

If the person has enough money you are likely to get nailed for (wire services) fraud.
I'm not a lawyer but that's IMO how it would be prosecuted, or something of that nature. 
Doesn't matter "how" you steal the key and defraud the owner of control of the wallet ultimately (e.g., if you eavesdropped on them in public inputting their password or something, that would still be considered "hacking" to use it).
TL;DR: "No."

Wait until Bitcoin gets on chain privacy features. People will just stop paying taxes.

Even a no deal would be better than being in the EU, having 70% of their wealth sucked up by unelected bureaucrats to give to third world invaders.

Exactly why no one, especially old timers to Bitcoin, believe him at all.

Saving for the future sure is awful, make sure instead to consume useless disposable garbage, because your money is going to be worth a lot less in 2-5 years anyway.
If you think this is a sustainable system you are delusional.

That happens after they freak out though.

Nice shill comment though, I'm sure ShareBlue pays well.

Atomic swaps to Tether would allow merchants a BitPay style service that doesn't rely on banks by letting them swap into Tether to avoid BTC volatility.

60+% spent on welfare. Says a lot you didn't mention that part.
Or the fact that 60% of that welfare goes to illegal and legal aliens instead of American citizens.

They also still claim Ross Ulbricht hired hitmen despite that being an FBI fabrication for which the charges were dropped entirely (their evidence was a "printout" of a supposed forum post that only appeared after they seized the servers).

It's because the "peaceful migrants" murder white people and rape white children, i.e., what the German government brought them in for. Gotta pay their invading mercenaries.

Considering they are not net taxpayers, yes it is.

Who cares, these people casually inflict suffering on literal billions to enrich themselves. Breaking their century long hold on peoples' lives is worth temporary suffering.

Be bullish on BTC because of stuff like Lightning network passing 1000 capacity, Trezor getting CoinJoin, upcoming onchain privacy features, etc.
That's the way I look at it.

Not really, considering they pay in far far more than they get out of it, and third worlder terrorists coming to the UK isn't actually a benefit.

Aye I took a look at the BTCPay atomic swap branch, seems like it would be pretty easy to integrate a Tether swap based on the LTC swap that's there already.
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:47:25
It will probably take at least 10 years before this happens on a large scale, but various governments et al will figure it out sooner than later and start accumulating via OTC exchanges.
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:07:21
People would invest in less useful alternatives, but they would do it.
Bitcoin just means that "everything stays the same" more or less instead of becoming a weird barter economy to avoid the bank system. It's a highly attractive alternative to buying random useful goods.
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:09:55
You have to pay them 4% of your deposited money just to have it exist in the bank.
Loans won't be -4% rates.
TLDR: Loans won't be favorable any more than now and you will have to pay constantly to just have money. It's theft.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:19:40
Yeah it's malice, not spite.
@_date: 2019-04-16 16:55:50


These days they could atomic swap to Tether or another stablecoin to "hold" USD, and then swap back when paying for stuff in BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:15:56
It's weird how the typical central-bank-Keynesian-fraud-defenders haven't shown up to tell us all how we should be thankful to the benevolent central bank fraudsters for proposing to charge us extreme fees to hold our own money.
I guess even the typical IQ 50 central bank shill can't figure out a lie good enough to actually make this seem palatable.
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:13:04
I agree on your timeframe, people are bad at understanding the adoption scenarios of tech in general.
VR is probably the only other "new" thing, but even that isn't "new" in that it was made before but simply sucked back then compared to now.
It's also an example of people expecting overnight mobile-phone-level ubiquity, while the actual adoption rate is closer to that of dedicated GPUs when those were first introduced.
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:19:38
Looks like it's crossing on the lower timeframes now too

Maybe if the IRS didn't want to keep forever increasing taxes while giving that tax money to illegals and foreign governments, people wouldn't have a problem paying taxes.

I like how they throw this in there as being equivalent of ransomware viruses, despite there being no such thing as a "BTC hostage" case.
They are literally making shit up. And people think Reuters is one of the more reliable outlets. LOL.

If you subscribe to Keynesian economics you are mentally deficient. It's a system that has failed year after year for its entire existence and is based on a scam of usury and fraud.
You aren't going to convince anyone by recommending them to read propaganda by Keynesian cultists. Keynes is a cult for dullards who like being defrauded.

I'd like to see atomic swaps to tether or other stablecoins in BTCPay, that would probably allow big retailers to have confidence in transacting without having to deal with swings (e.g., like bitpay but automatic and no banks involved).
