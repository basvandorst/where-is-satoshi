We have a few people moderating the site on a daily basis and do our best to remove anything that is obviously not legal and ban those attempting to scam, but with thousands of items for sale we have to accept that some slip through.  At least we are trying to remove such content - openbazaar and anything decentralised are not even going to attempt to moderate content so will be a hotbed of scams and illegal items.

 is well established now with over 40,000 users and several thousand items for sale at any one time.  It has a proven and trustworthy escrow service and helpful support (disclosure: I am one of the co-founders and developers).  We haven't had any external funding so far, so our development progress is sometimes slow and our ability for marketing is limited, but even so we appear to have considerably more users and traffic than any of our competitors (that are Bitcoin only).  Come and try us out!

Wouldn't that lead to the same scenario?  Sellers would look to complete all of their sales outside of the site to avoid paying the fee

It was in a third party plugin so not our own code.  But regardless we are taking responsibility and the financial hit.

Paul from CryptoThrift here.  Just thought I would address the comments. 
After the hack we were hoping to implement a multi-sig solution to prevent it happening again, but realised that it is going to take some time and doesn't address the root cause.  Hence our decision to suspend escrow until we can implement something without rushing it.  We've started processing escrow releases manually already today and should have them all done within 24 hours.  
We're in no way associated with bitmit and we have no plans to shut the site down.  We just wanted to be honest that we were hacked, we are absorbing the cost personally, and the sensible thing for us to do is to suspend escrow until we can tighten up security.

Decentralisation of Bitcoin is great, but I fail to see the benefits of decentralising a marketplace.  How is it useful, except to avoid the authorities when conducting illegal sales? Do you really see "joe public" using a confusing and faceless escrow system and having nobody to call when they run into difficulties?
And a Bitcoin replacement for Ebay already exists -   CryptoThrift has been running for over a year and has thousands of active listings.

Read the article that Bitcoin Magazine wrote on him and it will be clearer...

Definitely flying under the radar and could benefit from a decent round of advertising.  But yes, with 50,000 users and processing several million dollars a year in sales through its escrow, it's by far and away the leading Bitcoin marketplace and auction site.
