That's what I'm saying though. That's good going but 1 grand doesn't change your life. I feel like we missed our chance!

Quick question, how does one sell their coins for "real money". If I want to cash out and do you have any advice for private wallets and what to do? Because I don't even own 1 full coin do I need to make a private wallet or is that for much larger traders

Currently I'm brand new and I have my funds on an account called coinbase that i'm verified on. I haven't done anything with it. I basically have the cash on the site and I believe I can buy and sell on there if I want.
 I am tempted to put like £100 into it and leave it, so I'd have like £300 on there. What exactly is a private key and how doesn that benefit me over an online site, I quite like the idea of it not being tied to a phyiscal thing as i'm always upgrading and also deleting stuff (not sure if thats how it works)

I said 80K INTO coin, not on a coin. If that makes sense

nice, but I wanted to know how I add to it. Say I put 5 bitcoins in a wallet and it sits there for 5 months and then I want to add another to it, how to I send it to a wallet if its in a safe or like not plugged in?

The whole private wallet, storing and seed thing is still super confusing to be and probably stops many others like me joining in.
I have a certain amount on coinbase but like, what do i actually do? I don't get it and I've read about it a fair bit

2 years I guess.

Do you think that's possible? Or will that be so long away that it's sort of not worth waiting?

I  don't think it's worth me spending like 25% of my portfoilo on a wallet. I'd need more I think to warrant it

Yeah, that's what I'm saying. How would I recover from a physical or software issue. I don't want to go into a wallet if I'm not comfortable in recovering
