What legends!

Who cares what the guy from Mad Men thinks about bitcoin?! He’s fictional bro.

Sorry I’m holding a meme-a-thon on the 1st.

I’m sorry to hear that Jon. Is there anything in particular we can do to improve your experience?

You're like John Connor taking the radio on the day Skynet took over.  I'll follow you John!

You raise an excellent point Mr. Cunt Juice.

We’re all just here to pass the time until moon so I don’t mind a mix of proper articles and shitposts. Bit of variety.

I used it recently to re-verify with CoinJar. The title of this is misleading. Bitcoin companies are using Australia Post tech but Australia Post is not actively getting into bitcoin.....yet.

I don’t have it. Someone posted this in r/cryptocurrency when the April prediction came true.

20 years from now when our kids are saying “were you around when people were snapping up Bitcoin” I would hate to be saying “yes I was there but didn’t buy”.

They were a magical 70 days back in December ‘17.

My username is actually a reference to a 'Whose Line is it anyway' joke where Ryan Stiles says in a game "Welcome to such and such...I'm Twice Nightly". It's all I could think of when signing up for Reddit.

I’ve got two weeks holiday coming up if any of these need help. I know SQL and that’s about it. Let me know when I start.
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:50:57
That’s true. But having predicted this in January and it’s July in two weeks is pretty impressive.

Airport prices are the real story here.  The loaded chips are only $5 at suburban Red Roosters.

Hey! McAfee is a goddamn BTC national treasure. Don't put him in the same sentence as that other asshole.

You sound pretty jilted. The Boost business model works on structured recipes to ensure consistency. They don't hide what the recipes are and I guarantee you none of the recipes instruct '1 strawberry'.

That is fantastic!!!  MOON!!!

You seem smart. Do you know per chance what the clunking sound my car makes when I turn is?
@_date: 2019-09-06 10:11:52
They call this spike type a “Bulls on parade”

So if a split happens do I have control of my coins in both legacy BTC and BTC148 with the recovery phase?  Or am I reliant on Blockchain here?
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:03:04
Thanks very much. Good info. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 04:10:14
Thats because its a global-currency.  I'm currently working on an intergalactic-currency which will fill this hole in the market.

The loaded chips isn’t a main meal. It’s a snack. And I’m not really outraged by the price. Just taking the piss.
