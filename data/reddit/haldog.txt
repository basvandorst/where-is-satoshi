If price is staying in a narrow range I’d guess it’s because there is an equal number of buyers and sellers. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:29:41
Looks like you made the decisions, not crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:23:06
My thoughts exactly!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:38:18
I have instructions in a safe for accessing the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:58:44
Or a huge buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:22
Couple months ago I bought a few hundred $’s worth, just on a whim. It’s more than doubled now!  Wife is even asking why I didn’t buy more ��

Suntrust here and they flag every transaction as fraud and I have to call them to get it to go through.

I got one in my second purchase. Maybe you referred yourself ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:07:25
Plenty of time for money to be made. ��

Bought a couple months ago at $5700 when it was at high. Working OK so far.

That may have been my fart they heard, just sayin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:15:29
Yes, a rational stock buyer would.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:35:19
Which future?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:46:30
Death and taxes, can’t really escape either. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:18:27
Lead by example.

Did you email it?  I did a couple weeks ago and then couldn’t figure out how to access it. 8-10 days afterwards I got an email from Coinbase saying it hadn’t been claimed yet and a link which I followed and claimed the coin.

Figured that’s what you did. I was leery about tying bank account to a company I didn’t know so used debit card as credit card. Just had to call fraud alert number to release card and re-submit the transaction. 
The cards usually come in just a few days. Good luck!

Opened up a Coinbase account several weeks ago.  Used my Suntrust card to make a deposit. Set off Suntrust fraud alert but Coinbase never asked for anything like password.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:53:49
You can say that again!
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:54:52
It’s a good cause because I say so. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:35:55
Some people seem to think that no one will think it’s real unless they see it at least 7 or 8 times. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:28:44
60 coins or $60?  If the former you like risk. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:21:33
It’s stupid but on the scale of Real Stupid it’s pretty low. Humans regularly do things with a much lower chance of return, the list is endless. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:42:33
Could be, for sure. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:16:13
I’m more confused now than when I first read the question. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:50:14
I had that happen. Just deleted the app, then downloaded again and put in my 12 words. It all came back. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:26:32
I think it’ll go up and down in a tight range until it doesn’t, then it’ll move higher or lower out of that range. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:55:31
Wouldn’t that cause the price to drop though?  Increased supply of Bitcoin relative to fiat should result in lower price of Bitcoin, or so it would seem. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:07:36
We’re on the same page. I thought you were saying the price went up because whales were selling. 
It went up because they stopped selling. Gotcha.
