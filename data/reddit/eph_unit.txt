Its really hard to say.  Bears taking profits?  People getting scared and cashing out?  Maybe it has something to do with the FOMC minutes today?

In some ways, I kind of just want to not look at the chart for a couple weeks, and hope for the best.  But its hard...

The main article implies there are merely "signs policy makers will rein in dollar purchases that limit the yuan’s appreciation"--IE nothing is definitive yet.

The intrinsic value of bitcoin has always remained the same - it has value as an anonymous, frictionless way to give and receive virtual currency electronically.  For any currency not backed by gold, the intrinsic value is simply confidence.  
BTC has two things going for it--the technological advantages over traditional currency and confidence from the community that this is a thing worth real value.  Even if the price drops, at this point, the community of believers has grown strong and sees the value of BTC outside of the investment realm.
These fluctuations are natural and will become lessened as adoption slowly grows.  The "price" of bitcoin matters not.  Unless you have unit bias there is no reason to buy 1 whole BTC.  Just buy $20 worth of BTC and order a pizza with it.  The "price" of bitcoin did not disallow you from doing that, did it?
TL:DR - use bitcoin as it was meant to be used and you'll never be burned.  Speculate on it and suffer the fate of a speculator (stress, worry, volatility, etc).
