I'm gonna go against the grain here and say that is mostly fine to trade at 2x-3x leverage, NEVER above 5x and ALWAYS setting stop-loss(es) to avoid getting liquidated.
10x, 25x 100x... is just gambling with extra steps.

I often look (way) back at the charts just for this. $7000 for just one Bitcoin seemed like science-fiction back in 2015 and here we are having even seen almost $20,000!

As Dr_Hibbert says, it's just a joke. Lamborghi V12s are the most popular hypercars out there so everyone wants one but no one can afford it... unless of course your BTC is worth a fortune.
In the real world i'm pretty sure 99% of hodlers think just as you - We aren't waiting to buy an Aventador with our portfolio, we are waiting to achieve (somewhat) economical independence with it ;)
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:42:02
Well, the entire $1M infamous McAfee prediction may very well based on some degree of your theory...

No, i watched the last crash live on Binance and bottomed out at EXACTLY 6001
There was a TON of buy orders at that price.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:43:41
Until december of 2020, then all the way up to McAfee's 1 million.
That'll be something.

Special performance by John McAfee on Consensus 2021!
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:21:11
Honest answer: last time we hit 6K in april we rebounded because it were A TON of buying orders at that price. I saw the same yesterday at 6,1K so MAYBE we're going to rebound already.
I really believe that there's people with a lot invested in crypto that just won't let the price sink below 6K for whatever reason they may have.
Also the new Aventador SVJ will be released towards the end of the year SOOOOOO....
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:28:23
Just googled the model. Strange looking vehicle for sure.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:57:50

Don't fell bad. When it reaches new ATHs you'll be super happy of having bought it, no matter if it was 12k or whatever.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:07:45
I will never park an Aventador in a theme park anyway sooooo...
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:47:24

Black Aventador SV Roaster? :D
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:33:34
McAfee said so!
No, but seriously, i hope the guy is right. It's not THAT high actually if you compare it with the ATH of december and take in account that 6 months have gone by.
And hell, if the predictions of 50K by the end of the year are more or less right, it should hit 15K this month already!
@_date: 2019-04-10 21:44:35
Around $100,000  
Once the next bull run peaks, that is :P
