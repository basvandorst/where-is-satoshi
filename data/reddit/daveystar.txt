Totally with you about the taxes and investments. The taxes was just an example what the masses can bring into Bitcoin. I just don't like the idea that Bitcoin will be almost only about storing your money away to hide it from others and then mainly big amounts. Call me naive but my idea with the so called revolution is not this one.
ATM's, campaigns to get retailers in, etc are, at least in my mind, to get it to the masses. That all the technical hiding, promising and not delivering the promises is setting us back is a total different story. Rules can be changed during the game but don't make it look like it's normal.

You want the crypto market pumped with fiat money, take care of the small "inverstors". All together that's the REAL big money. Governments know this already for centuries. Increasing the tax of the wealty doesn't bring anything but the other 99%.......Guess you BTC Dev's get my point. 
Satoshi would have wanted BTC to be for everybody and that's absolutely not the case at this moment with incredibe fees.

So there's my point. Go for the masses and you will be king. With a name like Bitcoin a golden opportunity I would say :o)
Most here on Reddit are to Western minded. The fee of $20 is really a lot. Especially for people who get a pay check of $200 or less a month. Now we can discuss if it's wise for them to invest and get to know crypto but please don't. I like them to decide.
Also the Western people who want to know about Bitcoin just get scared away. Even if the want to buy a small amount they will at least feel taken when they see the fee.

So true what you are writing and I'm so fed up with peolpe telling they are buying every dip. 
They must have deep pockets which I don't believe so they are just scared and are trying to talk like a wise guy. They always tell the same story about stupid people and the smart guys like they are buy at the absolute low because they are so intelligent and experienced.
Did they also sell at the highest point or do they have unlimited funds?

Take care of the fees and people will be more able and willing to buy for small amounts. That's the only reason that alts like TRON are mooning as they are.
Can't wait for these kind of updates and upgrades. Kick all life out of the most anoying one, SHITCash!

I've got both and they both do the job. Put your coins on them, put them away for 5 years and have a look then.

Your the fun guy at the party I guess but don't worry, you can go short very soon. I suppose you are not here to warn us are you?

Sold mine all on Friday and will buy again probably on Monday. Stevie Wonder could have seen this coming.
