I️ came to this thread to see if anybody else noticed. I’m new to crypto so idk if this is all that interesting or not. But at 5:08 pm EST, all three coins on coinbase had a large price dip. I’m new so I️ don’t really know or understand how the prices of these separate coins could so closely match each other. Anyone care to educate a n00b?

Do you think there would be any negative side effects to the possibility of these "suggested" regulations? Is there any indication or way of knowing if the price of bitcoin could be effected (positively/negatively) in a big way with the idea of banning users in these regulated areas, or the fact that coin base and companies like them might move overseas? Or is it just as simple as the price of bitcoin doing whatever the price wants to do, as you previously stated. The way you referred to it as a "paradigm shift in the way that money works" is one of the coolest pieces of insight I have ever heard when referring to bitcoin, and should be considered as its official slogan. I thank you for your very detailed response sir.

I appreciate the response! I in no way intended to pass along any investing advice onto my family, just wanted to hopefully obtain some objective opinions from a wide variety of people here on reddit. Again I thank you for the input sir.

And sir I am somewhat familiar with the idea of doge coin and I just saw where you tipped me. I cannot thank you enough for your kindness. I have saved your name, and when I acquire my first bitcoins, you will certainly be hearing from me to return the favor. Again, my many thanks to you sir, you're a gentleman and a scholar.
