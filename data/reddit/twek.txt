not with the blockchain, I have been logging every trade and on btc-e.com
and i have been polling the ticker data every second and saving it.
guys I have the data, Im just wondering if i published it, with the ability for users to run simple queries against it if people would use it
sorry for the confusion

Ive been gathering the btc-e data for a while now. I am an experienced Web Developer with an extensive background in SQL and MySQL, I am just wondering if there is any interest in the website described in the OP

i currently have ticker data (every second)
and every trade recorded
(with some small gaps as i am still working on the data harvesting code)
but i only have btc-e data
and only in depth data on 
ltc_usd,ltc_btc, and btc_ltc
do you have another exchange i could start getting data from?
and what other symbols should i grab?
the code is written in a way where i can easily start grabbing any symbol on btce, but it would take me a couple hours to grab data from another exchange, so earlier is better :)

thanks, what features would make you come?

thanks ill keep that in mind, 
ive heard good things about postgres but have never used it.
and i tried out mongo but i dont think the management tools are there yet... all though a "no sql" database is probably a great idea for this...
but alas i really only have experience with MSSql and MySQL so ill probably use MySQL.

bitstamp doesn't do litecoin does it? 
id like to stick to exchanges that do bitcoin and litecoin if possible, 
more bang for your buck (programing wise)
