You're commenting on a post where the actions of an anarchist group are being pinned on a bunch of students that were holding a peaceful protest before they showed up. Anarchists are not left or right; they stand for completely different values than either and trying to associate one with the other would require an impressively narrow perspective. So no, it wasn't an action of 'the left'. 'The left' doesn't smash buildings or spray people in the face to make a point. Not to say they aren't capable of conflict - anyone is when life and liberty are threatened. But modern liberal ideology is purely that of fairness and equality, so it is conflict averse by nature unless pushed very hard. 
Of course there are also those lacking intelligence or morals that simply don't have values on either side of the fence but just end up there and can cause conflict due to a sense of othering.
Conflict only exists where people don't see each other as equals. Right wing ideologies of division and supremacy create conflict. Left wing ideologies of equality and progress diminish conflict. When people express superiority and discrimination conflict will build on both sides. The oppressed and the oppressors. But conflict is not a trait of 'the left' or 'the right', it is the effect of their ideologies and the human desire to be treated equally. The desire for freedom confronting the desire to control. 
And of course the vast majority of people simply don't commit violence, left or right. The extreme right do have a very special fondness for it however - because their ideology tells them they're superior. That's why the country has 50x the right wing terrorism it does compared to Muslim terrorism - the excuse the president's using to discriminate and ruin hundreds of thousands of lives. 
And that's why the more division is sown, the more conflict there will be.
