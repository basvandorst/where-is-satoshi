Haha cool. What's your target point for sell?

Maybe reddit deactivates inactive accounts and when reused they use that date to reactivate mute function.
That's just my assumption though. It's definitely annoying.

You can’t worry about the amount for good return when your investment amount cap is already decided. I recommend investing only what will not affect you for the foreseeable future. And research about bitcoin so you can decide for yourself how much potential you see in it.

It’s my bitcoin and I want it NOWW!
In all seriousness, don’t listen to predictions. No one knows. Hodl and see when it draws horizontally. Then see if you wanna invest then

Don’t use Coinbase although it’s easy to use.
Use Coinbase pro. It has substantially lower fee
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:53:52
I heard Binance has good rate. Just gotta secure your bitcoin in wallet. They’ve been hacked before. Not to say any other platform is immune with certainty.

“Big chunk” is subjective imo.
Elaborate on why you think using a foreign bank in this case is a bad idea.
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:52:03
It’s a matter of perspective.
They aren’t wrong and neither are you.
Real estate is almost guaranteed to generate profit depending on the location. And it can pay itself off if you do it right. There’s always going to be a demand for it, and that demand will grow in most cases. Multimillionaires aren’t idiots. Why do you think they invest in real estate?
On the other hand, crypto doesn’t require a great fund or management, and it has great potential but riskier by nature. Still in its infancy, people are in a speculating stage. The fact that no one knows when it’ll explode or by how much makes it difficult or rather impossible to plan out your financials for the time you have left. You might get the profit you want in a month or 50 years. We can’t know.
The difference between you and your friends is simply that you accept the risks and strongly think that bitcoin WILL explode within a reasonable amount of time that it’s worth your investment while they choose something that’s already proven and is safer.

I forget from my trips abroad but I do know they don’t just tax everything. Do you remember what’s the cutting line? I think it was $100,000 or above.
Edit: nvm it’s $10,000
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:01:44
That’s an option. But not everyone has all the time in the world for a government to change IF that happens. This is just a thought as to what options we got.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:07:54
From what I read all over the internet, Coinbase is a terrible platform to trade crypto.
That's all the input I can give.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:56:22
There's no guarantee to anything, but if it spikes the way it did before and then fall into the ground, wouldn't people who sold for profit during that bullrush (from a reasonable profit target, not be greedy) and then buy back later make that extra buck? Which then you can invest more into bitcoin. From observation, a lot of people in the price chat are going for this model.
I do see the risk. No one can predict when it'll fall and how much it'll fall. And greed plays a major role when it's an exciting time.
I'm talking about astronomical spike everyone notices. Not sell and buy during times like yesterday. Something worth your attention and your investment.
The majority of people who lose money seem to be the ones selling prematurely because of fear or getting FOMO trapped.

New reddit members are automatically muted for 30 days since the creation date of the account to prevent bots and spams.
29 days to go for me. Hang in there.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:57:39
Oh didn’t know that. Coinbase pro has lower fee also I heard. Kraken was also praised.
If you are just gonna hold like I am, GBTC is pretty great since you don’t need to secure your bitcoin and fee is $5 per trade on fidelity doesn’t matter the amount

The fact is home they live in can be an investment if they choose to simply rent out rooms. When you have a house, it’s much easier to get another house, then another and another. It’s a proven method.
They might have a lower risk tolerance than you, and they see that their friend is investing heavily on something so risky and uncertain in their view. Speaking in general, say it’s not bitcoin and say you were in their shoe. Wouldn’t you want to advise your friend against it?
I want the mass to accept bitcoin, and I think they will in time. That’s why I’m investing. But I’d also understand if my friends didn’t share my view right now. When we reach more solid ground the day will come we wouldn’t have to convince the value of bitcoin to anyone.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:04:06
Ah I understand you now. Lower the risk. Lower the possible amount of profit BUT you're still in the game when it gets fun.
That makes sense. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:17:32
If the mass around the world accepts bitcoin in time, which is what a lot of us are expecting, it is undeniable the demand for it will rise. And if it does, it’ll stabilize.
I read somewhere that we can’t send money to half the population on earth right now due to borders or they don’t have access to banks that work with ours.
Just as an example, if that other half population started using bitcoin, a company such as Amazon could gain access to them by accepting bitcoin payments. That’s a massive growth in business on top of decreasing expenses.
Now for your statement, it doesn’t need to replace fiat. I believe it can coexist just as other commodities and other methods of transactions have coexisted with fiat. Some are better than others. Realistically I’m simply betting that bitcoin will come out on top based on the movements, needs, and technological advancements around the world.

I think he meant to say the opposite with that first sentence
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:59:15
Coinbase pro
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:46:11
Adding onto this question. Say if your realized profit from Bitcoin is 1M, would it count as income and they tax you in the bracket 1M incomer are in?
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:06:39
Thank you for your welcoming!
I've already invested in GBTC not knowing the pros and cons.
Trying to pull out of it for the freedom of 24 hours trade even if I have to pay more fees for trades.
Seems like there's a lot more to learn though when you want that freedom. Still worth it.
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:10:08
Thank you! That's just what I was looking for.
I got FOMO trapped on my first trade, and as my buy order was going through the price went up drastically, which put me in a bad spot.
That's why I wondered if I affected the price by putting in one large order.
Definitely wasn't anywhere near 1M.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:55:09
You can’t time the market. No one can. Buy and hold for at least a year. And don’t worry about it :)
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:40:48
Now I know not to put one large buy market order because it's so volatile price jumps around.
But when the price drops, which will happen, isn't that the best time to buy? Instead of buying not so optimally weekly or monthly.
I see the advantages of DCA such as safety and less stress, but if I believe bitcoin will prosper in the long run anyway, wouldn't it be better to invest all in the week it's relatively low?
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:34:27
Agreed. Hodl it is.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:28:53
All these predictions just for one to stick and lets you say I said this I was right or I was close! now listen to my next predictions. Don’t people have better things to do.. bitcoin does what it wants. Doesn’t care for predictions. Play the long game and hold, take your eyes off the charts on the screen and relax. If you believe in the bigger picture, spikes upward or downward don’t seem significant. But if you’re trying to daytrade and be miserable, to each their own I guess.
