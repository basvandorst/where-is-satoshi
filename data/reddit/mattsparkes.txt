You make a valid point - I'll add a note explaining that it was edited. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:27:27
I meant libertarianism, not the article - I'm the author.
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:23:10
Apologies for that. I'm the journalist who wrote that story - will jump in there now and fix it. Any good suggestions for alternatives?
@_date: 2014-01-11 08:58:19
I did a piece on the storage service at around the same time as this one: about time that people had a way to safely store coins without having to have technical know-how. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:20:03
What part came off as condescending? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:42:16
I've been covering bitcoin for quite some time already. Fascinated by crypto-currencies. Keep an eye on the technology page at the Telegraph. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:13:27
Good to know. One thing I would appreciate is a heads-up when there's an interesting development in bitcoin-land, especially if it's a UK story. Going to cover bitcoin more regularly from now on. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:09:40
The fiat level is for insurance purposes. Simply because Lloyds doesn't want fluctuating levels of cover as BTC rises/falls.

I'm sure Amazon has people in a room somewhere looking at this stuff. Whether or not they'll ever decide to act on it is quite another matter. Interesting point on Kindle though.

I've replaced that item in the list with a 3D printing firm. Not as tasty, but equally cool.
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:10:57
I've also heard no mention of a £1k limit, although I'd be willing to admit I'm wrong on that if you point me towards where you read it. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:14:04
Ah. I'm using blockchain.info so didn't see an option to send without a fee. I guess you need to delve deeper into their option page, then, to do that?
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:19:50
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:25:33
So you can merge wallets? How do you go about doing that?
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:17:35
I don't think it's necessarily bad at all. I retain a certain skepticism though.
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:29:55
So, is 2140 accurate? If "20 years or so" is wrong I'll get it changed ASAP.
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:40:51
Interesting. I'm shopping for a mountain bike at the moment. I'd buy it in bitcoin (at least in part, I don't have that much) if I could.
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:39:41
Now fixed.
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:33:08
I don't really follow I'm afraid. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:41:12
A bit risqué for the list, unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:28:54
I've just sent you a message.
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:32:01
I've read most of this before, but one thing still confuses me. Say bitcoin takes off in a big way and becomes a common way to pay for day-to-day items: won't there be a vast amount of change wallets floating around? Or is it likely that in the future there will be more simplified clients which automatically merge change wallets back into the main wallet, simply by sending the total value as a transaction?
Also, come to think of it, what happens to a wallet that is emptied in one fell swoop? Does is cease to exist? Or does it remain open but empty?

I have a degree and a masters degree in computer science. Went into technology journalism after university, then went into newspapers covering courts, crime, politics etc, eventually ended up back on technology.
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:20:38
I have a small amount. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:07:59
Thanks, boyber.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:47:56
I have balance in a blockchain.info wallet. What's the easiest way to claim my Bitcoin Cash, sell for Bitcoin and send to my existing wallet? I'm fairly inexperienced with altcoins so a step-by-step idiot's guide would be really useful, if one exists?
Is there a time limit on doing this?
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:56:08
Have an upvote, mate. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:41:06
Yup. Also it's a nice thing to frame. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:41:39
My feelings exactly. In fact, it cost me a few quid to have it framed...
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:36:14
My Knuth cheque hangs on my office wall, uncashed. What would I do with a blockchain transaction? 
@_date: 2016-10-29 18:50:11
I'd love an invitation if anyone has one...
@_date: 2016-05-17 13:59:24
I did! Thank you for the reminder about the reminder! All sorted. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-10-02 11:17:43
For someone who has coins in blockchain.info, what are the better, *simpler* options? 
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:04:16
Disclosure: I wrote that and submitted it.
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:32:23
Or freelance. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:32:00
Become a journalist and get a job there.

Right, just registered on bitstamp, told it to expect €50, then registered on transferwise and told it to expect £45, and to transfer it to Euros and send it to bitstamp. Hopefully by the end of the week it'll arrive and I'll be able to buy a fraction of a bitcoin, just in time for it to plummet in value.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:09:01
Blimey. That's long-winded. Previously it seems like you could zip money straight over with Pingit. I wonder why they put a stop to that? Not sure I've got the patience to go that route, to be honest, not just for an experiment...
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:50:08
I've just registered at TransferWise, and when I try to convert GBP to Euros it asks m who the recipient is. Do I need to sort the bitstamp account first? Do you then just transfer money without doing anything else, and they convert it automatically? Or do you need to inform them to expect the cash? I was hoping to use blockchain as I've just registered there and got the iPhone app - is that not possible?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:15:34
Great, thanks.

Try spending $ in a Sainsbury's and see how far that gets you. 
Clue: not far. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:23:50
I'm running this now, thanks. I'll leave it for a few days and see what happens, but I suspect the answer will be "not a lot". 
Currently running at 70Khps, whatever that means. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:37:57
Odd little pub, that. I like it when I'm back in Norwich. May buy my first bitcoin beer next time. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:59:27
It's a confidence level, which has been broken. A milestone figure, even if passed before - but not a high, admittedly. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:37:56
Ah, but money won't be there until Friday AM, says TW, so probably can't buy BTC until after work on Friday. Who knows what it'll be then...
