This 1000x, to be succesful you need to rebrand to PayBull, PayMoon, PayRocket, PayLambo or something similiar. Anything but bear. Seriously, what where you thinking?
I would never use a service like this just because of “bear” in the name.
I am very bearish on this company unless they rebrand.

Good on you for taking this seriously �� :) This actually gives me a belief that you could pull this off after the rebrand. I'll be following this project.
FYI a few definitions of bear in a fintech/finance context (most definitely not what you want your brand to be associated with!)
- A bear market is a condition in which securities prices fall and widespread pessimism causes the stock market's downward spiral to be self-sustaining. Investors anticipate losses as pessimism and selling increases.
- Dealer, investor, or speculator on a stock or commodity exchange, who expects the prices of securities or commodities to fall in the near future.
- A bear has a negative outlook on the market (belief that the value of an asset or market will decrease). A bearish investor will alter their portfolio strategy by liquidating securities they believe are going to lose value in the foreseeable future.
