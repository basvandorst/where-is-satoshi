The suspicious site:
     
@_date: 2014-12-22 08:45:24
Why not? I was using them to check a bitcoin address.

For the record, I rest my Tor identity and tried typing 'blockchain.info' again. It connected me to the HTTPS version. 
Thank you.

Any one knows how to detect and report exit nodes?
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:10:22
Can exit nodes remove site encryption?
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:47:55
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:21:08
Does typing  then solves this problem?
@_date: 2014-12-21 13:06:23
I save them in multiple keepass copies.

What's your thoughts on Olivier Janssens's criticism of Bitcoin foundation. Do you think decentralized, direct crowd funding initiatives should replace bitcoin foundation?
This is a quote from his post:

Thank you for explaining. So if I didn't move my bitcoins after the nlocktime becomes valid, a potential attacker only needs my to get my key to spend my bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:29:29
hmm, this is strange. This is what I got.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:56:18
Are future updates completable with old versions?
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:44:51
Ok, thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:52:40
Thank you. I just finished reading this. It goes well with IkmoIkmo explanation.

You can create a deterministic wallet using [electrum]( and then send your bitcoins there. Make sure to write down the seed and secure it in multiple locations.

Don't feed his ego.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:05:30
This explains why It worked on Safari but not firefox. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:40:11
I haven't seen an answer to this. The wiki only talked about how to solve the storage and CPU problems.
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:08:17
Thank you for sharing.
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:10:53
Do they convert it to BTC? 
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:10:46
Can't you just use a VPN to circumvent that?
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:46:56
This is the future.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:37:10
How do we make sure the **future** bitcoin developers will not push their own beliefs into bitcoin code?  
I'm not talking major changes that everyone agreed on like changing the total amount of bitcoin. I'm talking about small-ish controversial ones like implementing blacklists that include known malicious spammers or illegal content distributors.

edit: 
page info
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:24:33
Another question. Is this site affiliated with changetip.com?
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:56:14
ah the joke went right over my head unfortunately. 
1 nickel
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:28:11
looks like GAW CEO
@_date: 2015-01-19 15:07:07
Does this connect with telegram users?
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:43:49






Is that link correct?
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:08:33
Bitcoin.it scalability page states that:
"Today the Bitcoin network is restricted to a sustained rate of 7 tps due to the bitcoin protocol restricting block sizes to 1MB."
Let's say we increased the block size to 1,000MB (around 1GB) in 10 years, we'll still have up to 7,000 TPS. Large payment network like visa proceeded around 30,000 transactions in 2012 according to source the source in the article. 
How does bitcoin plan to solve this? Is there a way to squeeze more transactions per block?
@_date: 2015-01-20 06:31:30


Couldn't GAW deleted these information from their forums before receiving a subpoena?
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:48:32
Wow thank you very much for the detailed response! I had the wrong impression that visa processes that many transactions per second. I also didn't figure in that future bitcoin companies will also provide off-blackchain transactions.
1GB was chosen arbitrarily just to see how much it would take to catch up to today's payment networks. I agree it was slightly optimistic figure.
And that google car example will make me broke if it came to life. I live in a very crowded city and It would be very expensive to get all these cars out of my way hahah

Do full node operators have incentives like bitcoin miners do? 
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:10:42
No, I'm using firefox with all addons disabled. 
Ok, I just tested it on TOR browser and had the same warning. However, it's working just fine on Safari. It looks like a problem with firefox.

I haven't bookmarked the onion address. I thought typing the address correctly was enough to reach the correct site just like with google.com
