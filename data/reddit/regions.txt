Legally, no, you *could* give your friend a gift of the original amount of bitcoin that you purchased but anything over that would incur capital gains on your side, as there is a taxable event in the transferring of coins. Thats my interpretation. You could claim the coins were lost in a hard drive failure and then move to a tax free country like Dubai (not that I would like to set foot in that shithole) and then become an employee of a company that's been conveniently created. Your income would be tax free if you are a tax resident of that country. Unless you are a US citizen and earn over 100k in which case they want some tax unless you renounce your citizenship.

These comments are so annoying. It's 80,000 now but you need determination and dedication to keep Bitcoin for that long so it's not like you can just assume he would never have sold. Maybe you get off the train at 300 dollars, maybe 3000 dollars, maybe you hold them. Everytime you play the lottery, you've *almost won* each time.

Most people come for the easy money then stay when they educate themselves on what bitcoin is all about. Even if people sell, it's rarely all of their coins.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:01:43
The reason it didn't take off like wildfire is probably because cryptocurrency is quite difficult to understand, especially for the type of people who dont even know where a dollar comes from.
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:36:05
People have been asking the same question since bitcoin was 5 dollars.

if all cryptos are worth 160 billion that means one single company is valued at 1/100 of the entire value of the thing they are selling.

NEW DELHI: Amendments to the I-T laws do not seek to tax inherited gold and jewellery as also those items that are purchased through disclosed or agriculture income, the government said on Thursday.
The Lok Sabha earlier this week passed the Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Bill, which proposes a steep up to 85 per cent tax and penalty on undisclosed wealth that is discovered by tax authorities during search and seizure.
Dispelling rumours that jewellery would be covered under the amended law, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said the government has not introduced any new provision regarding chargeability of tax on jewellery.
"The jewellery/gold purchased out of disclosed income or out of exempted income like agricultural income or out of reasonable household savings or legally inherited which has been acquired out of explained sources is neither chargeable to tax under the existing provisions nor under the proposed amended provisions," the CBDT said.
During search operations, conducted by I-T department, there would be no seizure of gold jewellery and ornaments to the extent of 500 grams per married women, 250gm per unmarried women as also 100gm per male member of the family, it said.
"Further, legitimate holding of jewellery up to any extent is fully protected," it added.
The Bill, which is currently under consideration of the Rajya Sabha, will amend Section 115BBE of the Income Tax Act to provide for a steep 60 per cent tax and a 25 per cent surcharge on it (total 75 per cent) for black money holders.
Another section inserted provides for an additional 10 per cent penalty on being established that the undeclared wealth is unaccounted or black money, taking the total incidence of levies to 85 per cent.

CBDT said: "Tax rate under section 115BBE is proposed to be increased only for unexplained income as there were reports that the tax evaders are trying to include their undisclosed income in the return of income as business income or income from other sources.
"The provisions of section 115BBE apply mainly in those cases where assets or cash etc. are sought to be declared as 'unexplained cash or asset' or where it is hidden as unsubstantiated business income, and the Assessing Officer detects it as such."

Well, it is a case of the relatives estate being in order before the inheritance is given to him. They are only charging him indirectly, on the cost of the original gift, not from his own pocket. Not that I agree with any of it.

A lot of stupid answers on here but my take on it is that 800 is a nice round number where a decreasingly small numbers of people are starting to see a return to their two year investment. Once we reach an all time high, anyone who previously invested in bitcoin has theoretically made money. Whats not to like about that.
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:17:28
lol, bank transfers only occur between the hours of 9-5 monday to friday so I think bitcoin is still safe.

This is the biggest metric imo (along with coinbase signups numbers) that shows bitcoin isn't going anywhere. Expect double the current price before Christmas.

It's been this way since 8 dollars and we had less than 50k subs. It will be that way until we hit 6 figures and the rate changes per day are far less.

Anyone saying this isn't talking about *serious* money.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:14:49
Yes, for a new person they are up there. If you have a significant amount of money spend a few hours learning how paper wallets or hardware wallets work because storing money on coinbase is like trusting a bank thats only a few years old, storing bitcoin in a hardware wallet is like having the money in your pocket.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:52:59
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:00:50
Having a hardware wallet full of bitcoin in your pocket is not safe either so my point stands
@_date: 2017-09-30 05:22:21
Yes but none of it matters if all the hash power goes elsewhere making bitcoin easier to attack. We need statements from the miners telling us which side they are going to mine on.

We need to get them to ignore it for longer so bitcoin reaches the hands of regular people, but the time they try to subvention the system it will be too late.

For like an hour. If you can time things like that you're probably a multibillionaire anyway. We all thought it was the start of "a new paradigm" and the only way was up. If you think its the same this time around do three things:
1. Zoom out on the chart to get perspective of this drop.
2. Check out global volume levels since 2013
3. Check how many new member's we've added to coinbase. Hint it's 800,000 last month.
To use Andreas's analogy, a small boat gets in trouble in bad seas, that a massive ship would have no problem with. 
As the store of money increases in bitcoin the rates of change will decrease. I wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin is the most stable commodity the world has ever seen in 10 years.

I see the argument but this is the largest attack against bitcoin so far and it doesn't seem like it's going to win. Were still really early days if bitcoin can defeat a few more of these it will only strengthen.

Bilzerian mentioned a few years ago that he bought into bitcoin, so he was already invested. We may find out in time to come that he actually bluffed the public, posted those snaps and then proceeded to sell into fiat causing the crash as others followed suit.

There was nothing stopping satoshi mining after he collected his first pile of coins. I'd like to think he made off with a couple hundred thousand coins that are still early coins but ones that are not in what we think of his traditional stash. He's sitting on a hotel sun lounger listening to business men waffle on about their boring business deal meanwhile he is the source of the modern eras best kept secret.

Who cares, many got into bitcoin to make fast money, some sold but then others stayed because it is a technological innovation that might end central banking.
