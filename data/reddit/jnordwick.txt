Yes! If you look around you'll actually find a tree graph of the longest chain posted about 2 years ago.

And they settle on different days too (read the contact spec for the specifics).
Cboe is 2 biz days (should be wed) before the 3rd Friday of month. Cme is last friday of month.  This is really important because it affects the discount applied to the expected spot price.
The collars are also different. (I dont remember them sorry)
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:08:34
The margins aren't completely correct either.
Cme: 38%/35% (initial/maintenance)
Cboe: 44%/40%

When they printed the qr code it was worth much more.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:50:11
Settlement price is determined differently too. CME from their weighted avg of books on top bitcoin exchanges, cboe from gemini.

Its called "the roll" and the old trade date is closed and new one begins.

They are selling order flow. Totally standard practice for retail brokerage.
When you click the buy button, somebody has to sell to you, and companies pay for the right to do that.

Which? All the prospectuses I've read hold the futures. I don't think I've seen any crypto ETF proposed so far that actually creates and redeems with the currency itself.
They was the big issue the SEC had with them in their comments denying them.

His understanding of the market microstructure around GLD doesn't seem to be fully correct., I think. I'm having a difficult time understanding his point though. He just seems to be another metal conspiracy "EVERYTHING IS MANIPULATED!!!1!" theorist.

This is all it takes to get 600+ upvotes now? This isn't even funny or mildly interesting.
I wonder if anybody could make a btc confidence index from posts like this - the easier it is a get junk goes up, the less confidence people around here have in btc and more worried they are.
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:28:58
I couldn't care less what btc is "really about".  It doesn't make any difference. It could have been started at a way to siphon money to the Communist billionaires who support zombie Hitler. It is only what it is now, nothing more or less.

Ugh. Yet another economically illiterate Bitcoin supporter. I keep hearing about this guy, he does not impress at all.
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:59:29
Absent conspiracy theories, gold ETFs actually own gold.
ETFs hold assets and owning a share of the ETF means you own a claim on those assets. Eg, a share of GLD is approximately 0.1 ounces (minus management fees that have accumulated).
An ETN is a little different, and there is already a BTC-based ETN denominated in SEK, but it only trades over the counter. ETNs don't hold the asset they track.

Finally bitcoin that has intrinsic value.
Or am I just going to get the stream of usual "it's chocolate gold" responses?

Locked away where? Are you literally saying that banks are sitting on mounds of cash (in the electronic sense) way more than usual?
I need a source on that.

Just checked with a friend. To be NFA compliant in fx you need to follow the FIFO rule similar to equities and commodities.
Most crypto brokers and traders are definitely out of compliance. The SEC knows this but had basically said try to obey the rules going forward but we won't go digging.
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:22:56
Since you cannot sell a specific lot in bitcoin (at least i don't think you Can) it would follow the First In First Out rule so you would be taxed on your oldest cost basis.
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:31:21
FX isn't even close to the least volatile market. Fixed income is far less risky.
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:37:42
Or worse, somebody who just borrowed BTC. Deflation kills debtors.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:41:00
I see what you're saying, and I'm not sure what the rules would be on that.
The FIFO rule is (for the most part) that you have to close out the oldest position of the same size first. So if you:
1. buy 100 BTC (your savings)
2. buy 100 BTC (more savings)
3. buy 0.1 BTC (to spend)
Now if you sell 100 BTC, you must close position  If you sell 0.1 BTC you can either close  or reduce position  Anything that does not match an open position in size executes against positions oldest to newest.
I'm not sure how people who trade out of the same account would have to deal with that. I'd probably open two accounts, one for trading and one for day to day, to keep things separate.

Eliding Bob would be a horrible idea. Bob and Charlie are not drop in replacements. They each have their own counterparty risk and ability to pay. Alice loans to Bob because he has a job and better credit rating than Charlie.

Stop saying market cap. Gold and btc don't have a market cap. They aren't capital. You don't talk about the market cap of the euro or crude.
They have a equivalent value in dollars, a notional value, or maybe even a monetary supply value.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:44:49
I think you are confusing the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. Treasury notes used to be the dominant form of banknote before the Fed took over the responsibility. Treasury notes were interest free Fed notes.
Also, the Fed note is still backed. A bank needs to keep enough collateral at the Fed to cover all the notes it received from the Fed. So if the Fed were to be dissolved and the Treasury took over the currency again, they would have enough collateral to cover banknote claims.
This is separate from being convertible on demand.
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:20:25


Whoa. You way off the mark there. It is supposed to be one of the three qualities of currency: unit of account. Having an economy with wild swings in its unit of account is like building a house where your yard stick keeps changing on you.
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:42:52
Because it was useless and included a number of non-monetary assets that could only be guessed at. M2 is pretty useless too. M0 and M1 are the only two that really have much usefulness.

Money doesnt just get locked away as if hidden in the ground. Banks try very hard to not to sit on extra reserves.
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:10:41
That's only if everything happens on the blockchain. It is still possible for a bank to defraud deposit accounts or go bankrupt and lose everything entirely.
Crypto doesn't fix this.
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:59:17
I didn't say it will fail. I'm not sure what path it will ultimately take. It will just never be a very good currency.
BTC is still a floating currency. While fiat's supply is changed and that ultimately sets its value, BTCs demand changes and sets its value. The monetary history of the world is littered with failed floating currency experiments. Ultimately the major currency regime always reverts to a commodity peg (historically with gold and other metals). BTC seems to be just another cycle.
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:18:51
I know velocity is but i take issue with idea that money is locked away in some nefarious scheme by banks. Bank reserves are fairly low. It just sounds like more bank conspiratorial bs.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:37:43
It doesnt mitigate anything it just changes the playoffs of a price movement. 
Now if you buy BTC and the price falls, you just lost money in the sense you could have bought them cheaper if you waited.
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:18:10
Not sure how FX differ but it is the way it works for securities and that's the closest there is to an official position. The SEC doesn't see it as a currency yet.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:56:34
Re: the genesis-mining article:
It errors when it says currency should have a "a predictable supply." It should have a predictable value. If demand surges, you want it to maintain value not have a deflationary surge.
Also bitcoin isn't systemically durable. The system constantly leaks BTC from lost keys.
And gold is most definitely divisible. You can always make smaller pieces of gold. Heck, you used to be able to break some coins into smaller fragments intentionally (e.g., Spanish Pieces of Eight).
crypto sites can be terrible cranks sometimes.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:26:15
The 70s stagflation era already ran the predictable supply experiment with disastrous results. It's called monetarism. Even Friedman now says his ideas didn't work.
Bitcoin in the financial sense isn't nearly as forward thinking as its often economically illiterate supporters think. Technological the cryptos are interesting though.

You might not like it, people, but this is the same theory that brought us the infamous Keynesian Multiplier.

At where? These appear to not even be prop trades but for clients. Even if they were for the bank, the CEO can have an opinion they are a fraud in a colloquial sense and the bank as a whole and separate entity can see a profit to be made from the madness of others - that is Dimon's opinion didn't need to be the exact same esther bank's.
@_date: 2017-09-22 03:29:00
Bitcoin prices most certainly do not affect gold prices. You are just seeing both prices follow dollar value.
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:28:46
Half correct. Inflation traditionally is defined as "too many dollars chasing too few goods". If there is more too buy or use - eg the economy grows or there is more desire to exchange goods - then an increase in the money odd needed to prevent deflation.
The terms get so abused right now. People sometimes just mean rising or falling prices. I've seen this taken to the extreme and (incorrectly) refer to things like egg price inflation (lol).
But almost every economist agrees that in the long term inflation is a monetary phenomenon.

Warning people are going to give you books mostly on equities. BTC et al are supposed to be currencies but the way you hear people talk about them and the way they resound, they certainly don't act like FX. Honestly I'd have a difficult time telling you what asset class is most appropriate and I've worked in everything from FX to commodities to derivatives.
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:49:42
Bigger issue: it lacks any stability of value or price. Either one would be nice.
