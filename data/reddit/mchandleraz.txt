How is that a poor attempt? Those are **literally** drugs.

There's huge criminality in fiat currency as well. Ever wondered how drug addicts pay for their drugs? With cash. Ever wondered how gangmembers purchase guns? With cash. Ever wondered how people bet on the outcomes of street races? With cash. It's the THEFT that is the problem. As far as your bit about good honest people wanting to help police stop crime... Most of the good, honest, people I know don't call police unless their life is in danger any more because police in my country (USA) are more likely to make the situation worse for **everyone**.

Did I ask for a smartass "Stock/commodity/currency trading 101"? No, I asked what caused the price to fall yesterday. Of course there's no organization setting prices, but there's always a cause.

I hadn't, but that makes sense. Thanks.

Lots of things, but the biggest is that people are apathetic to **everything** unless it affects their nightly TV schedule :(
I still love this country, and I know it's better than many other places, but even in my short time on this Earth I've seen police across America become more and more militarized and abusive, while politicians take more and more of the liberties and freedoms that this country was supposed to be founded on. It's really sad, honestly.

Thanks. That makes sense. I know the basics of stock and commodity trading, but was looking for info on what event caused what looked like a panic. Have an upvote for not being a sarcastic chode, and actually answering my question.

Even then, drugs are awesome. Just don't get high when it will affect their safety.

I wouldn't want any sort of addict at the controls of a plane I were in, but someone who uses meth occasionally? Why not? Assuming they're not currently high or on a come-down, I couldn't care less if they smoked meth a few weeks before. But if we're talking about an addict that's either high or in withdrawals? Yeah, fuck all of that.

Yep. Exactly why I said the biggest issue is that people are apathetic to everything that doesn't affect their TV programming.
