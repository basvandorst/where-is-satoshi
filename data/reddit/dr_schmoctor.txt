So the reviews say you can get lunch with a drink for 24PLN = $5.88 = 0.005 BTC. Looking at [fee rates/confirmation times]( I wouldn't go lower than 0.0011 BTC/kB at the moment, you should get at least one confirmation in before finishing your meal. At that rate electrum quotes me 0.000284BTC = $0.34 
= 5.78%

This is  equivalent of those 'found a safe in my basement' posts.

I was thinking just that the other day. That would be great. Tags also allow you to filter the posts out from showing up in your feed in the first place. I do this with and their 'youtube drama' tag.

Nah, more likely just hype-induced inflated price + people on edge with loose triggers anxiously waiting for the storm to come.

I agree that it's too expensive. I don't want to be looking up the network's congestion before tweaking my preferences to calculate the cheapest fee that won't get stuck every time I make a payment.

Concepts not being completely novel don't make them invalid.
