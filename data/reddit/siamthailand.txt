I don't invest time and energy in nothingburgers. I can tell you right now nothing will happen. You just sound like the BernieBros and Drumpfsters who were convinced Hillary would be indicted for her server.
You see what you want to see.

The graphs have nothing to do with the underlying market and everything to do with how humans think. Which is why they all look alike.

Yes. When they act as if everyone is dumb and the financial markets would collapse in 10 years and only bitcoin will be the true holder of value.

How about fixing the shitty as fuck checkout before moving to bitcoin?

@_date: 2013-04-12 14:22:49
Fucktard, do you even graph?
@_date: 2013-05-14 09:20:23
And you wonder why people hate bitcoin supporters.
