He isn't the only one and we are still HODLing, although I wouldn't have used that phrase back then, still adding to my position whenever I think there is a good time to buy

For a technologically slightly backwards country this is a huge step in the right direction, even if its done by just one company ( Austria still cant figure out how to process stock sells and buys, (never mind wash sales) in tax returns, which are done automatically.

I use anycoindirect.eu, I just checked it, its available in the UK, the fees are a bit high ( about 4.50 euro for 100 euro transaction, miners plus anycoin fees ).
You can link your bank account and do a "Sofort"  buy 
(means instant), I use them on and off and never had a problem

You are an old hand at this. So am I. I have been trading Stocks for a long time ( yes I am aware this is not your regular Stock but BTC still follows a Stocks patterns ) and this looks like it is ready for a major pullback. ( Maybe not in the next week or two but soon )
I remember when BTC spiked to well over $1000 in 2013/14 and luckily I was able to accumulate a fair share after that at $200 to 250. I am holding for the long term.

Friedrich Hayek the ultimate Libertarian, read his books, they are eyeopening. 
I read them several times, just to understand what he was saying. Its amazing that something written 75- 80 years ago would be current today. Try " Road to serfdom" it will blow you away!
Thank you to  FLNI for bringing him up in the context of BTC
