Did’t it take around 3-7 months *after* the halvening last time for the price to skyrocket?
My take is this: Nothing significant will happen in May, people will probably save some money and the price will rise when people have the most available money to spend on BTC as a means to store value, which is probably around November-December next year.
I am most likely wrong but whatever.

Something something Tether.
Just enjoy the ride and sell when you see fit, don’t worry about anything else.
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:57:56
I agree with you but the timeframe might be shorter than you expect.
Consider that people will buy when they have more disposable income available (November-December). May is a very... odd date, people in a lot of countries just finished their income tax declarations, are not exactly short on money but they have not saved yet.
But IDK I’m just seeing things based on how the spikes of USD prices happen in my country.

Isn’t the one ring supposed to be kind of a doomsday device that corrupts anyone that wields it for too long and just generally evil incarnate, to the point that it gets destroyed in the end by throwing it into the very flames that forget it?
That’s a terrible analogy.

The raise in minimum wage means nothing since the current inflation rate is sitting at around 23% *Daily* (And that is a conservative estimate).

I would, if I had money.
Thinking on selling my car to buy at least half a BTC but IDK if I can manage that quick enough.

By my profession I try not to dwell in black/white. 
I do not buy into the whole Anarchist twist on bitcoin, anarchism in general is just a wet dream IMO (and this is just that, my opinion, not trying to offend anyone here) and not a very nice one TBH, you don’t want someone like me to get free reign over doing whatever the hell I want, and I’m one of the most mild assholes out there compared to what other people do. 
Governments being accountable to their people is something that is absolutely necessary and it *can* be done, just that the way of doing it is so hazy and an abstract idea (not to mention it takes work) that most people just decide to not bother trying to do it.
Regarding US debt, public debt (the amount owed by the government) is not the same as total debt, and it is smaller than the amount *owed to* the US.
The economy is an incredibly complex phenomenon that can be boiled down into bite sized “truths”, but just because these “Truths” are simple it doesn’t make the entire structure simple. 
I do not live in the US, I can’t really say I comprehend the societal issues there, but I know that people from my country (some of them I know personally and are close friends or acquaintances) go there and try to go there to live and work because the wages are better, the chances of finding work is better and the living conditions are *much* better.
Lastly, I do believe bitcoin and crypto in general has a place in the world’s economy, but I don’t see it being used as a WMD to “Collapse the rotten edifice that is the economical empire of the west” nor do I believe it will replace Fiat completely worldwide. The main reason for this is that, even now, someone like me that dabbles in crypto at a very shallow level, can’t really get my head around on how to create a wallet that I feel is safe enough so that whatever I store in it won’t be stolen without my knowledge by some Russian kid across the world, now imagine what it is like for someone that can barely remember their E-mail’s password or uses 123456789 as their password.
So until crypto becomes as easy to manage as paper currency for the **common** people (people that don’t even know Reddit exist) then I don’t see it fully replacing it or massive adoption everywhere. 
Again this is just my opinion.
Edit: Still, buy crypto, it is fast internet money that you don’t have to memorize a gazillion information about to transfer or use.

How much of those 23 trillions are public debt?

The government of Venezuela can already track miners and usage via Electric bill consumption and internet traffic (Thank the motherfucking Russians and Chinese for that little trick).
I can’t be bothered to show you the wave of arrests of 2018 (Because I’m on mobile, not because of some pedantic reason, truly Reddit mobile is both a blessing and a curse) but you can google it if you are currently not aware.
Ok, we have some very good technowizard neckbeards on the crypto camp, but what happens when some of those sell out to the Government of US mothefucking A and start working in ways to track Crypto movements (Your fundamental right to privacy is out of the question, we are talking in the hypothetical all out war scenario against crypto)? 
As a Venezuelan user, you don’t see Bitcoin being used for transactions as people would like to believe. There is *some* adoption, but so far I can’t buy my breakfast or even a bottle of water using bitcoin yet, the reasons behind these are mostly to do with the instability of the electrical grid, the difficulties the businesses have converting those BTC back to fiat to buy things (Sending Your BTC to coinbase to withdraw them as USD into your bank account means you have to declare taxes to the IRS, and a business here is not interested in being robbed twice just to receive payment) and also the lack of technical knowledge (Most people here have a somewhat decent user-level knowledge on technologies, but most people are not very well versed in crypto). 
Also using localbitcoins means you have to provide a lot of personal information, if you consider the shock and fear the 2018 wave of arrests generated, it is natural that people aren’t too fond of sending their ID, personal pic, copy of the constituent documents of the company that owns the bank account in Bolivares (Bs, kind of a funny coincidence on those letters). from which the money will be transferred (Only company accounts have a high enough wire transfer limit to allow any significant purchase in BTC) on top of their e-mail. This is done because sellers don’t want to be caught by the Government or scammed so they ask for a lot of info to be sure, unfortunately this means that government agents can work “undercover” as a seller and catch people trying to buy BTC.
And don’t get me started on the insanity that the crypto currency law is, is a half baked POS pulled from some idiot’s ass.
So far BTC is mostly used to “quietly” change Bolivares (Bs) into “hard currency” (USD, yes I know the sentiment towards the USD in this Sub but it is still harder than the Bolivar). Also the Government might or might not be using Crypto as a form of payment to sell our natural resources to the Chinese/Russians so there is that.

Thanks, this is a topic that I find very interesting and honestly would like for people to learn a bit more about it, not because it is some end-all-Be-all ideal money but because it provides more freedom to do things with it that you can’t with regular money or is much more of a hassle.
On the other hand, wallet security and accessibility for non-tech savvy people is something that is surely needed. The concept IMO must be “how can I make this as simple as just picking my wallet from my back pocket and opening it to see how much money I have left”, there are probably a lot of satoshis to be made on this idea by selling it as a product :P

I refer to BTC as crypto, honestly I don’t advise anyone to buy anything but BTC unless they know what they are doing, and BTC is incredible as a way to move money around without too much hassle.
Regarding anarchism: Anarchist by nature can’t and won’t be able to organize themselves enough to pull something through, it’s in the principle of that ideology for people *not* to organize because then it will end up being just another State being created and nothing was gained except death and pain for everyone that died during the period when everyone could do whatever they want (Hobbes was right about the human nature BTW).
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:53:09

@_date: 2019-10-15 14:25:57
Not OP.
You can in some places but I think OP is being overly optimistic regarding his description of “adoption”.
Currently it is something that only the rich* can afford since to use BTC you *need* a way to connect to the internet and most of the impoverished people in here don’t have access to a cellphone nor are they tech savvy enough to understand it, therefore they don’t try it.
Ironically people trust the US dollar more than crypto here but that is because it is both easier to understand (it’s just a non-worthless Bolivar which people already used) and doesn’t require any research. Also no one can steal cash from you without using direct force, meanwhile if the wallet is not secure enough you could have your crypto stolen without noticing and people here are *very* fearful of that (as they should be).
* someone considered “rich” here is pretty much anyone earning above 300$ monthly per person. So take that statement with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:08:35
Not the other commenter, but based on current standing? And my current income? With at least 2-4 years to pay it off? 
You’re damn right I would take a loan to buy 1-2 BTC (but not more) since I’m confident I can pay it off in that time (either by working or just selling the BTC) and the opportunity to buy “cheap” BTC is slowly passing.
Or I could be wrong and the highest BTC will ever reach has already passed and we are already in the “Nothing Can take this down!” Phase before the inevitable crash (and it *will* crash because whales need it to crash).
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:38:33
Not OP but I live in Venezuela so these are my opinions and not necessarily facts:
What we need is a change of government and a return (or implementation) of democracy and a more transparent state. Currently the government has the economy in a chokehold with a myriad of measures and decisions that either affect production negatively by making it harder or affects trust in the country.
I.E. Unless you are very big (to make deals with the government and pay them not to seize your company) or very small (to go unnoticed) then you are pretty much screwed, the police will blackmail you and force you to pay protection money, if you sell stuff in different states you either have to pay the national guard to let things pass or you have to pay a lot of people to give you the right permits (or die of old age waiting for the government to process your requests).
This is without taking into consideration that one day the government can just send some national guard and go all “Hippity hoppity we will seize your property” like it happened to Kellog’s, Agroisleña, Sambil, and a bunch of other companies that you can research about by doing a google search (Expropiaciones Venezuela).
The fastest way would be to just send a bunch of tomahawk missiles and kill everyone in power and obliterate the military and guerrilla leaders that support the PSUV, but that costs money and it would still require some sort of help to the opposition so that they can set up a government, also it will look badly and the US people currently don’t want to get involved in other countries’ business (Also I’m not saying that they should, I can’t ask another country’s fathers and mothers to send their children to die for my country nor can I ask them to throw their tax money at my enemies).
Also, China and Russia are supporting the government to destabilize the region (I know that if feces hit the fan then they wouldn’t get involved but right now they have a lot of personel in here to do some shady stuff). 
So basically we are screwed and the people here are not really interested in violence, curiously we are a very peaceful people and even mentioning of wanting to kill people like Maduro or the military leaders is met with shock and disgust, even from opposition members.

You mean that behaving like a sociopath, where everything is an investment and people are valued on how much they can give you is not healthy for relationships with other people?

Sarcasm over.
You don’t have to burn down your house to throw a party every once in a while, even going out sometimes with friends and paying for the occasional round is a nice way to say “Hey, I appreciate you”.
I agree with you and that sarcasm was directed at the people dissing social gatherings.

I know I will get downvoted for not supporting the apocalyptic notion that the current financial system will be completely replaced by crypto but oh well: I wouldn’t call the current status of the financial system “On the brink of collapse”, the Great Depression, the Great Recession in US history, nor the Great famines in China or the USSR had been enough to make their financial systems (as large or small as they were) collapse and be replaced by an alternative.
Don’t get me wrong, I want crypto to become more prevalent, but for crypto to completely overtake Fiat (and collapse the entire world’s financial system) then all the Governments in the world would have to either switch to crypto and take control of it (defeating its purpose) or countries as entities that rule over a determined population and territory would have to cease existing.
Things are a bit more complex than what some anarchists would like to admit, but hopefully crypto will still be able to keep working as a way to let people have more freedom (specially in countries like mine).
@_date: 2019-02-14 23:55:48
Venezuelan here to clear a few misconceptions: The reason why most people use Bolivars (The natioanl currency) is because you can get to jail our outright killed by the police if they catch you with USD or foreign currency (besides that our IRS equivalent can and WILL denounce you to out DOJ equivalent and then send you to jail under charges of "Financing of terrorism, crimminal Association, etc" if you own, trade or accept foreign currency as a business. There have been some changes in the law BUT ultimately it is up to the officer's discretion what to do, and when a corrupt government offical has the power to send you to jail/blackmail you for 5000 USD not to send you then they don't have much motivation to follow the new law).  
Cryptos provide a way around this. People are not Using crypto to buy "bread" (there is no bread to begin with but that is another subject) and groceries, they use that crypto as a way to convert their Bolivares into Fiat currency (USD) digitally and without exposing much of themselves, this also allows them to purchase things in other countries using Digital Debit/credit cards or just straight up "hodling" to avoid the constant devaluation (BTC went from 7 Million Bs last week to around 9, just because the prices of the USD increased in relation to the Bs).
People here are also not investing as much in real state or commodities since those are either cheap and getting cheaper by the day (with no one to buy them) or not available.
So yes, when people have the chance they hold USD or BTC, but mostly USD and not a lot of people have the chance, because as you said a lot of people "live" paycheck to paycheck (more like starve to death slowlier compared to having no job but I won't get into the intrincancies of how fucked up my country is ATM).

Not right now, probably during 2011-2015. 
Right now it is more like early 2000’s with people shitposting on random forums and the general public rushing to buy the new shiny things around, with some companies making bank but about to crash when the dotcom bubble pops.
The stronger, more popular companies *might* survive (Remember Yahoo?) but a lot of other ~~companies~~ shitcoins will go down the drain. 
*This analogy doesn’t pertain to how BTC is being directed nor any behavior in the market but instead just focuses on perception by the general public, I make no comment on comment on wether or not BTC will crash and never recover, hopefully it doesn’t and I can buy a few coins before it hopefully goes to the stratosphere
