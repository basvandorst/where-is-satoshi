How is it's fungibility weak?
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:03:13
Maybe in the next few years, or when it becomes centralized.

Are you using a wallet with 2x activated?
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:34:03
Good for us then.
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:34:21
Hahaha. It is right?
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:00:17
Sorry you feel that way. Why is that?
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:52:39
hahaha. But seriously Roger Ver has gone too far.

Ivan on Tech perhaps. He’s pretty technical. It says so in all his videos just about. “Programmer Explains”.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:03:16
I like your style. Cheap Bitcoin fuckers!!
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:57:41
What are the fees on nicehash?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:00:12
Repeat and HOLD then. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:42:55
Fo shizl.

And there is talk, I believe it’s unsubstantiated, that Mt.Gox had plans to have an ICO to raise $200M for a relaunch. The cheek.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:02:06
Got me again, twice bitten. Hahaha schooled, lol.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:57:31
Heard Bitcoin Cash is up 40 something percent as a bunch of people jumped over there from BTC. Lost respect and reputation which is understandable after all this crap, but didn’t see anything about shut downs.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:55:24
Please give me a link. I’ve just been on Twitter, FB, Steemit, and YT. Haven’t seen anything. Ahh shit balls.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:45:20
Haha. I’ve just been schooled on how not to believe everything I read on Reddit. Lol. Nice guys
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:34:12
Psychic. Haha. Did you buy in high? Maybe it was a nightmare.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:41:35
Haha. Soz man. You know what they say. HODL. I’m hoping it’s a correction.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:38:17
Corrections. They happen.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:57:21
Guess they’re thinking it’s stable now and is going for that 10k. FOMO.
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:10:38
Crazy stuff. There was another incident with Bitfinex last yearish. 
Amazing the increases we’ve had in adoption and market cap. Just goes to show how attractive this is to investors. Enable that 2FA, lol.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:37:45
Dude, you may not have typed that with this in mind, but a lot of people have invested quite a bit into this. They wouldn’t take too kindly to guys talking so negatively. Maybe don’t spread this around too much.

Welcome to the wonderful world of crypto. It’s on the rise right now due to the B2X debacle cancelation. I’d suggest getting a bit more now before it goes up higher.
