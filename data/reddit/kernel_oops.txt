Which alts -- honest question, I'm not familiar with any? Are they packaged so that a non-crypto-user will be able to jump in? I don't know the technical merits of Gems, but I think the idea of having a messaging app running on top of Counterparty, without the user actually having to deal with anything-crypto is a move in the right direction.
edit: I see Nxxty (on NXT platform?), any others?

I have two angles for this:
1. "crowdfunding" or "crowdsourcing" implies there will be a service or some sort of tangible benefit to the crowd who funds it. You say you will use any unused funds to crowdfund others. That's assuming there will be some leftovers to use to fund others. If not, all the crowd is funding is your dream to become a helicopter pilot. No particular benefit to the crowd.
2. There are probably some helicopter pilots in the Toulouse area who will be eventually looking for the same job(s) as you. Assuming most of them didn't come out of the womb with a CPL and 500 hrs in type, they have paid their way the hard way (i.e. work, savings, loans). Why should you have a leg up over them?
Bitcoin mining has an element of greed in it for sure, but it in the end it is like any kind of venture: you weigh the costs and the benefits, and decide if it's worth your time, effort and money to get into mining. It has nothing to do with feeding people that are hungry.
I moved to a foreign country to pursue a career as an airline pilot. I was 22 when I started. 5 years in school (no income), 5 years flight instructing (close to poverty level wages) and the last 7 of 8 years as first officer (close to poverty wages) at a regional airline. That's 18 years, and this past year is the first year I'm actually getting paid fairly (you could argue that I'm still underpaid) for the time, effort and money I've put in to make a career in professional aviation. What am I trying to say here? Get in line, work hard and pay your dues.

Reporting it is not the issue, not giving full credit to the person/organization that first broke the story is.
When you continue with someone else's breaking news, you'll include a "this was first reported by..." or similar.
Wait, I'm on the internets, what am I thinking!

Having Koinify behind Gems makes me more at ease with the project, but I agree with you, too many pump and dumps that have made anyone and everyone skeptical about anything beyond Bitcoin.

Talk to Adam B. Levine and ask about LTBcoin. In fact I believe he wears a t-shirt that says "been there, done that". I kid. He doesn't like t-shirts.

Sure. And if the legal fees exceed his cost-benefit threshold for keeping the show on, he'll simply shut it down and do something else, and the patent troll moves on to the next show. Like you said, he's a multimillionaire and doesn't *need* anything.
I happen to enjoy his show, and I'm willing to show some support for the cause.

Whenever my 7-year-old asks about Bitcoin, my answer is, "42."  To answer her next inevitable question, "why?", I hand her "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and say good night.

Lucky you! I received mine over week ago, and as soon as I connected it, cgminer threw an overtemp cutoff error; the unit looked like it had been around the "block" a few times... It's a dud. So no bitcents for me. But considering BFL, I guess it's par for the course.

~$30,000 in flight fees + 4 year (worthless) college degree here in the States; that was a decade ago, so prices have changed quite a bit since.
It's an awesome job, but a f**ked up career, unless you carry a bit of luck and whole lot of good timing with you. But I digress.

In the U.S. people do identify themselves as "social liberal, fiscal conservative" etc., but politically speaking there are really only three options: liberal (democrats), libertarian (often lumped together with republicans) or conservative (republicans). The really bad thing about this is, politicians are seldom after a real solution, and more about party lines. The few politicians who actually want to work together across the isle, get herded back in by their leadership. So all problem solving stops at an impasse, because party lines trump everything.

First off, welcome! 
Lengthy first sync is completely normal. Once the Bitcoin client has synced up with the blockchain, subsequent syncs will take a matter of minutes. 
While you're waiting for the wallet to sync up, head over to the bitcoin wiki and read up on wallet backups. Do it now.

I'm an airline pilot. Not a single day of my career has been as intense as an average day following bitcoin. Add to that the never-ending wait for couple of BFL ASIC's, and I can literally go relax at my day job.

Autopilot is on typically from 500-1,000 feet after takeoff (some prefer to handfly up to 10,000 - 18,000'), and it comes off just before landing, at 5,000 - 1,500 ft if in visual conditions, and at 500 - 200'  if in instrument conditions (clouds, fog, rain etc) -- or all the way down if aircraft has autoland capability and conditions warrant autoland.
Yes you could use onboard wifi to trade, and with the onset of iPads as approved tablets for replacing charts/manuals, many of us will have quick "company approved" trading devices right at our fingertips!
In all seriousness, I won't be doing any trading from the cockpit; though autopilot is on 90% of time, it's not like all we do is read newspapers and play Angry Birds. I take that back. That's exactly all we do.
As the saying goes, "you could train a f**king monkey to fly an airplane." The difference? I don't get paid in bananas.
