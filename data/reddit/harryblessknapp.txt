Could you rephrase that? Are you saying something about litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:27:23
What did you sell it for?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:41:20
This nerd drama, for want of a better term, makes it very hard to follow what is actually going on with crypto a lot of the time. So much drama. Some of the discussions in here get do heated that it's hard to see through the rage to what is actually being said. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:24:39
Realistically, I'm not sure how anything can be expected to remain free from decentralisation or corruption. It's a nice idea, but when there's money involved, snakes are gonna get involved. Crypto is still a brilliant concept even if that does happen. It's still a way better system than current international bank transfers 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:41:15
Honestly, some of the posts in this subreddit worry me. Some of these people aren't managing their expectations very well. Fingers crossed all goes well for them.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:10:11
We're all idiots mate. Including you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:34:22
What is real money?
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:09:33
It's almost like some people don't know much about some stuff
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:45:53
People getting impatient probably bought at like 15k
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:37:14
Shit man this is the first explanation that made sense.
The trouble is the volatility.
Also, who ever gets denied by the bank for their wages?
You could buy burger king in Amazon stock if they accepted.
But I think I finally got the sense of value. Yet it doesn't seem inherent to bitcoin. More just a good vehicle for a universal measure of value. A new global standard outside of regular FX.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:26:36
You're comparing an investment to currency. Which is where bitcoin confuses me. I'm reluctant to get involved in a discussion as this place is very meme heavy, which is not really my sort of scene. But if you're genuinely interested in a serious discussion, I'm very keen to hear your thoughts.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:44:36
He asked his mates what they thought of it. If you don't know too much about a topic, you're just gonna parrot what you've heard here and there. Or you just say nothing. Given that they're 3 mates in a pub having a chat, if one mate asks your opinion on a topic, you'd have to be a particularly boring cunt to answer, "no comment".
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:57:08
This is honestly the part that confuses me so much. It's a massive paradox.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:53:08
I kind of have but I still think people are overselling it a bit. I'm a big fan of cryptocurrency as a concept. I'm just not sure why people are talking like the current system is totally broken. I work a very average job but I've got a lot of financial freedom and very little oppression. Getting paid in crypto isn't really going to change much there. Blockchain is awesome, and I think potentially an improvement yes. But it's not going to tip the global capitalist system on its head. If crypto succeeds, we'll just be living in the same world, with a more efficient currency system.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:06:33
Yo, I can't really disagree with any of that. But that's a far cry from the whole oppression Vs freedom angle.
The trouble is, how is crypto ever gonna achieve widespread adoption, if those who truly believe in it are insistent on hodling, and those newcomers buying them now are only doing so as an investment, with very little interest in the concept .
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:30:05
Okay 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:45:16
You think ln gonna arrive any time soon and actually work?
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:39:26
I gathered it was a quote but it felt like you actually believed it 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:31:36
There is a real conflict of interest within the ideology of bitcoin. Being a useable currency and the dawn of a new technology and monetary system is quite a profound scenario. But being a commodity and investment vehicle with excellent returns is kind of antithetical to that. I'm finding it very hard to reconciliate the 2 in my head. Which do we want?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:38:01
A lot of people are doing this. I've seen some scary mind sets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:36:39
Did they really?
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:11:21
Because they don't have an in depth understanding of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:10:37
Incorrect. Intelligence isn't distributed like that.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:58:20
It says a lot about Reddit that I genuinely don't know how serious you are.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:24:32
This is like leaving a cake with a really greedy person with no self control. Obviously they're gonna eat it and that makes them a dick, but come on man.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:33:03
My mate at GS is absolutely enthralled by this madness.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:32:32
What is this monetary oppression and freedom from it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:09:21
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:39:56
Is that your measure of intelligence? Knowledge of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:33:15
Do you actually buy every day?
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:42:16
Mate, the drama about all the forking and bitcoin cash, is almost unbearable.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:45:04
Mate they were in a pub having a conversation among mates. In what dimension do you live where during an off the cuff conversation with friends in a pub it needs to be fact checked and cross referenced on the fly.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:19:45
You haven't made anything until you've sold.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:21:24
Cryptocurrency's real use is pretty niche. It's not gonna replace cash. And if it does, being traded like a commodity is completely at odds to its function as a day to day currency. If anyone truly believes in cyrpto, they're not in it for the gains.
