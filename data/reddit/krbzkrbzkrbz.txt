Because there are other crypto's, that work in other ways, that have distinct use cases? 
Because the other crypto's aren't going anywhere, and are also improving upon, and specializing the underlying technology?
Because how the fuck are you going to *just* convince everyone to *just* use bitcoin?
What kind of question is that even...?

How many browsers do you use daily? 
I use 1, maybe two, if something isn't working right in my main one. 
There are thousands of cryto currencies. 
Noone's going to use thousands of browsers. 
If you want mass adoption / integration into daily life, then you need to have them all easily accessible in daily life.

Impressive dude. 
Which ones? and what are you using them for?

You can want it till you are blue in the face, but that ain't gonna make it so. 
It's especially obvious considering that there are currently thousands of cryptographic currencies being used, and more to be built in the future. 


This doesn't appear to be a coherent statement to me. 


This is the only thing I'm arguing. Everyone *just* using bitcoin is not realistically achievable.

This is too many browsers. Someone needs to make a browser that will integrate all crypto's.
