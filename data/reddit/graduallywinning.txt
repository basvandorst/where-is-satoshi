So you mean you use Bitcoin QT? As in the original vanilla wallet? That's a wallet
In my humble opinion, once you start dealing with a significant amount of money (whatever that means to you), I'd take that off computers and onto a securely generated paper wallet or hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:13:41
Close, but not exactly.
When you buy a ledger, it comes with no recovery phrases whatsoever. This entire sheet is a counterfeit, not just putting scratch foil.
When you boot up your ledger, it will ask you for a PIN, then it will generate a phrase for your (or you can input your own).
The scammer here got a fresh ledger, initialized it, and wrote down the phrase onto this counterfeit document and made it look official. The recipient just used the device as provided, which was preinitialized.
This could have been avoided by resetting the device (wrong pin 3 times), and more importantly, from only buying a sealed new device, and understanding how they work first (maybe watch a few YT videos first).

NO NO NO NO NO NO.
A passphrase, or private key, that is generated by anybody other than yourself is no longer private, and therefore *ENTIRELY WORTHLESS AND INSECURE*.
If anybody has ever seen or heard or had any part of generating your secrets, you are 100% compromised and you must not store any amount of value with that secret.
Not interested in debating you on this either. It's non negotiable, it is not a matter of opinion, these are the basics of this crypto game we are playing.

What he means to say is the fee is fixed.  It would allow you to accumulate more satoshis if you buy once for $40 rather than twice for $20.  But I generally agree if you are buying an asset that you expect to appreciate 1000% or 10000%, a small fee is almost irrelevant.

Imagine you have a dollar bill in your hand. You exchange that for 10 dimes. You give somebody a dime, they give you one ETH. You do this ten times. At the end you have 10 ETH. If each ETH is now worth $400, you have $4000 dollars. How much did you spend? $1

It hit like $199 on GDAX. It's 142 right now. Consolidating around here for a bit, but I think we'll break right through 200 next time and stop around $300. Longer term I can see it going 10x from here ($1400) even at that price it is cheaper than BTC (1/10 the price but only 4x the coins).
Also, all these people that are rushing into Bitcoin are going to download Coinbase and see Litecoin and will buy it just because they can get more of them for their $. This is going to have massive pressure on the price. It can double many times before even reaching parity with ETH.

You are so much farther ahead than us who've been buying all the way down for 10 months. This is literally the lowest risk time to buy, not when prices are at all time highs. When the price rebounds, everybody and their dog will say "damn I wish I bought more when it was $X".

There are reasonable limitations to liberty. One of those is that your decisions don't negatively affect others. When you choose to not vaccinate, not only do you put your child at risk (who is not capable of making the right choice for himself, and should be protected from your bad decisions so long as he's a minor), but you put other people at risk since vaccines aren't 100% perfect, meaning those who vaccinate can become infected because you didn't want to vaccinate your child.

Sure, I'll give you that. I'm not sure I've captured the idea fully - but here's what I am trying to get at: if I open a business, I am openly agreeing to engage in a game of competition with others. When I send my child to school doesn't mean I consented to exposing her to infectious diseases that can be prevented using a vaccine. In a libertarian stance, yes, I could find a school that only allows vaccinated children, and you can send your child to a school that allows unvaccinated children - but once again, there are reasonable limitations to liberty when living in society and it doesn't make sense to duplicate everything. Every now and then we, as a society, have chosen to socialize things like schools for practical purposes, and in that case we need to have a reasonable compromise, even if theoretically I agree with the libertarian stance, that just isn't the scenario we are working with. Open a unvaccinated-children-welcome school first, then I'll debate that point with you.
Next, am I willing to force people, at gunpoint, into getting vaccinated? Namely, am I willing to use the threat of violence to force somebody to do something? I am undecided on this. On one side, I do believe it is society's responsibility to protect minors from the harmful decisions of their parents when the harm is clear cut. From that perspective, yes, I believe society has a duty to enforce such a scientifically uncontroversial thing like vaccinations.
On the other hand, assuming I didn't care about your child's well being, I would say no, society shouldn't force you to give your child a vaccination. However I would agree with society using force to prevent your bad decisions from having an effect on the rest of society - namely using force to ensure you don't enter public schools or public areas where the rest of society has the reasonable right to be insulated from a few people's bad decisions.
In the end man, I think most people would agree with what you're saying and the ideals of libertarianism. But we live in a society where people's decisions do have affects on one another, and therefore not everybody can have perfect liberty. The question is not whether we should have perfect liberty, because ideally we all would. The question is, given that we all have to live amongst one another in this thing called society, where should the compromises be made. And when you essentially ask me, should we value your individual freedom to choose whatever silly thing you want at the detriment of the vast majority of society, under this system, I would favor the vast majority of society. 
If there was a way around that, such that each person could have perfect liberty and not affect others with their potentially bad decisions, I think most people would agree that is a better system. Just not pragmatic in today's world and therefore debating it has no practical implications.

Computers have gotten cheaper every year. People buy MORE because they are getting more value, besides they will have more purchasing power in the future so no need to hoard money. With inflation I spend less because I will not have as much purchasing power in the future so I need to protect whatever wealth I can. The prospect of having less money in the future makes me spend less, not more. Who on earth spends more money today when they know they will be sucked dry in the future? Would you believe that as my BTC has undergone extreme deflation I have tended to spend more rather than less because I am wealthier today and believe I will be even wealthier tomorrow?

As energy prices increase, fewer miners will be profitable. They will stop mining and instead watch the mempool until there are enough transactions with high enough fees to justify searching for a block hash. I suspect increase in fees actually causes upward pressure on price because it decreases the velocity of money (fewer bitcoins changing hands). Upward price invites less profitable miners back into the mix and transaction fees lower (less contention for block space since there are more miners, at least until next readjustment).

That all makes sense, but collapse has a lot of negative implications for everybody, I don't care how much Bitcoin you have. It sounds like you want financial progress and evolution, which can be a gradual process. Creative destruction wasn't proposed by Schumpeter as a systematic catastrophic event, but more of a gradual process that replaces old with new. I imagine you'd be hard pressed to come up with a solid argument in favor of collapse over an orderly evolution.
Edit: Schumpeter not Trumpeter lol.

What risk in allowing withdrawal of forked coin variant a little while after it stabilizes? Eventually exchanges/brokers will have to support that otherwise their clientele will flee elsewhere.
Just imagine if BCC is actually worth anything (my best guess is yes, it will be valuable, regardless of what I think about it). If people lose that value you can bet your ass they won't leave their money with them the next time a fork is imminent.
The fact that this isn't the default across all exchanges tells me we are still in the early days of Bitcoin.
I also believe, if you care, that the fork will be a net gain for those who just hold private keys. So BCC may go to 1k, but BTC will not go down as much, maybe half that. I believe this because myself and I'm sure many others like me are also going to hold onto both, maybe for good. And that will give it value.
