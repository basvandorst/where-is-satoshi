As a reminder, as this whole Btc thing grows, IDEALLY there would be exchanges targeted to different uses and purposes. A Wall Street high-volume, high-speed, high-reliability exchange is looking for a different customer than a Coinbase. (and Lord knows they'll cost different) 
And since BTC isn't as regionally picky, there's still nothing stopping people from starting "wild west" exchanges for cheap in places where there isn't as much auditing.. And if I feel like one of those guys has a reward to balance the risk , I can do business with them and my money is still good in the States.

I like bitcoin. So I follow the bitcoin discussion subreddit for news and discussion about it. I do not like how *some people* on this subreddit act.
I think any potential adoption of the currency will be hindered if it's proponents are seen in a negative light. "Fuck you" across the top of the discussion area doesn't say "we're rational and open to discussion" it says "angry mob."
Even if the mob is angry at someone who really did do something wrong, it doesn't justify starting a mob.

The heads of the banks are one thing, and while they may be the ultimate decision makers, them not being informed this particular second isn't the issue.
There are people at these banks who are aware of it, even if the whole organization isn't. If a major decision needs to be made, they'll compile information, submit it to the execs, who make the call on what actions they'll take. Head honchos of ANY corporation never know *everything*, they can't.

My point wasn't about pens vs acres, or about flavor vs quality. I wouldn't be surpised if even after we get lab meat as a viable product that your chickens are still far far more enjoyable to eat.
But you said your animals have 13 acres. 13 acres is a lot of space, and the amount of land available to farm is going to continue to go down. [Here's an article that talks about it in context of California]( but the problem is global. 
Point is, lab meat, while definitely on the dreary side, would be a method where the reduced amount of farmland we have can be devoted to primarily to the stuff that *needs* the space.
I don't think you need to worry about your free range birds running out of space soon. But by 2025 you're going to have say... 600 million people living just in the *cities* of India, let alone anywhere else. We need efficient options.

2. Creates a central failure point, which p2p normally protects against

In the short term, "Don't use Windows" is an okay fix, but if people started using Linux frequently for handling money, people *will* try their hand more often at creating money for the platform. (Plus, cross-platform firefox plugins and the like.)

My counter argument on that would be it's too early to tell if it's good for the long term. I want it to be, and I'm not a speculative investor but someone who's used smaller amounts for purchases.
On the note of gold and fiat currency... Isn't gold currently under an expectation of "other people will want it?" I was under the impression that the gold standard is dead. Fiat, like the US dollar, has the major backing of the US government saying it is the only form they'll take payment of taxes or other fees in. 
I would argue that good ol' Silk Road (or similar services like Atlantis), despite being something people don't like to talk about because of being illegal, help because 1. They aren't going away, so long as there is an internet and someone who wants to sell or buy controlled substances and 2. Bitcoins are of particular use and benefit over any other currency forms to them. An ugly fact, and hopefully one that matters less and less as people start to engage in more "broad daylight" bitcoin use. 
The electricity complaint is just silly, while I don't doubt he's an economic expert, I think he's out of his field of expertise and vastly overestimating the energy and computer hardware required. Besides, aren't various electronic systems needed to transfer/guard/store/etc money in "normal" form?

I think it's less about currency volatility, and more about implementation and tech stuff.
- Even if they're able to use pre-made tools to handle bitcoin, those premade tools need to integrate properly with all their existing infrastructure. Build, bugtest, load test.
- Customer support staff have to be trained. We're accepting a new form of money that doesn't act like other forms of money. They've gotta document how to solve issues. And what *are* those issues going to be? Shopify doesn't know yet.
- Legal issues. Not just with banks like pointed out. What shenanigans could a user try and pull with BTC, how do we catch/document it?
That's just off the top of my head. The bitcoin proponents have a tendency to forget that the bigger a company is, the longer it takes for them to prepare to do something, not everyone is as light and zippy as these little small-staff startups.

I've used localbitcoins, and while it certainly works (and fast! no verification drama!) It's a game I just don't see your average consumer wanting to play.
You're ultimately working with Some Guy(tm) and have the assurance of a small handful of other Some Guys that he's legit. That gets people antsy.
Hopefully stuff like the new ATM makes this process more reasonable.

Yeah, I think banks and credit services can provide huge advantages that people 'round here tend to ignore. "I want to pay someone else to take care of the headache of managing my money" and "I want to make large purchases and be able to pay for them on my own schedule" are huge, huge perks.
My issue is 1. you *have* to use those services to buy things online at present. You don't in person. 2. Said banks and services are pretty dang corrupt and getting away scot-free with serious crap like damaging the global economy. 
Bitcoin can help with those problems but it's no magic bullet to fix them.

Did you see the [Starbucks rumor?](
Short version is *supposedly* you'd be able to use BTC at Starbucks because SquareUp is already an option to pay them. SquareUp is a mobile/network payment system, integrating bitcoin support might be something they'd do to give them an edge over major competitor PayPal.
If Square gets bitcoin working with their systems then pushes a software update to the point-of-sale at Starbucks... The coffee giant can accept bitcoin without lifting a finger. They gain a little business, Square gains foothold in a potential new market, and bitcoin's economy gets jumpstarted.
Of course **there's nothing to substantiate this other than some guy with supposed insider info saying it.** I'll be astonished if it's true. But I'd still go buy a latte.

**I work for a computer security company, so here's some info on staying more secure without having to spend money:**
**Solution 1:** Echoing kinda on what said, the easiest thing to do would be to isolate your BTC related activity: use VirtualBox and run another OS in a VM (I'd recommend Lin over Win.) Then get your bittery on that way. I've never heard of malware being smart enough to attack a virtual machine, but it's *technically* possible, so use full disk encryption on the VM if you're feeling particularly worried.
**Solution 2:** Malware scanner. "Common Sense AV 2013 Edition" may not be enough, you can't exactly phone up Bitcoin and say "yo my ID got jacked and my money got stoled, can u fix" like you can (sometimes) with a credit card. MalwareBytes scan your hax 'n crax 'n torrented filez before popping them open. If you're worried you're already infected (and thus can't trust your OS), use NOD32 or other software to [create a rescue CD or USB to scan and clean the system.]( I work for ESET who make NOD32, but our 30-day demo can still do the rescue disk, so no harm in uninstalling it after you burned the disk.)
Oh and **back your wallet file up somewhere.** In an encrypted archive. On something that isn't inside your house.

If you're really worried about nukes, EMPs and global catastrophe... the thing that would have real value isn't gold or bitcoins, it's weapons, food and supplies.

Really? I say one less-than-extremely-positive thing and suddenly I'm one of "them."
I didn't say it was going to tank/crash/die/blow up/whatever. I think it can handle any of those issues. But you just can't get millions of people using *any* new technology without some "oh, crap, look at that issue, we never thought of that" moments. 
If you *assume* something is going to go wrong sooner or later and keep an eye out for it, you can handle those issues. If you go "la la la bitcoin is perfect in every way" then something you were blind to will create a major issue.

To my knowledge, no, other than "no one's tried to make it yet."
That being said since BTC ATMs are still so very very new, I'm willing to be everyone involved is going to watch their performance before investing time and effort in new hardware.

Man there is *no pleasing* some people. Nobody said you had to like bitcoin. I get it. But "here is another way to get money from your customers, if you want it, if not then just keep doing what you're doing" like literally what is there to object to?
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:18:07
Yeah, but in the current market, there's so few players (it's all financial giants) that you have to just deal with their BS. In this setup instead, competition is actually possible. lower fees!
Also, even if you *can* "shove the money under the mattress instead of in a bank" like you can with BTC, a lot of people may still choose to work with other systems in the name of convienence and accountability.
Nobody likes VISA. But people sure as fuck like having a phone number of someone they can ream out in the event of an issue. People will pay to not have to be responsible for their own cash.

I was just thinking that. You can generate private/public PGP key pairs until you pass out. You could use a different one for every single naughty website you go on. 
PGP keys are just as good for ID-ing someone as using the same-screen name or btc address.... not very. Now if you pull a DPR and use the same PGP key on a site that has real-life personal information, *THEN* you'd have boned yourself.
