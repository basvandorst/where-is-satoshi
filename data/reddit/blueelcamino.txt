Im sorry but my story as you call it is excactly how circle is working for me. I have an electrum wallet it was unable to send my converted bitcoins to my wallet or to send it directly to another company's address. Multiple failed attempts. I have sent multiple messages to circle with no response.  Ive used coinbase successfully in the past.

That doesnt seem like an ethical business practice to me.  Imagine you went into a store to buy something and then hand them $100 dollars they gladly take your money but wont give you what you paid for or give you your money back until you give them a copy of your id.

I deposited money into a circle account and cannot use it every attempt fails to send.  So I have had a terrible experience so far

 I did change the transaction to bitcoins .You are correct I haven't given them a copy of my driver license yet.  Its ridiculous that you can set-up an account, deposite money, but you are unable to spend your money until you you give them a photo AND a copy of your passport or drivers license.

It worked flawlessly today.  I think It just took longer than the 3-5 days for my identity to be confirmed.  My bit coin is saefely in my wallet as of now.

It could be user error I will read more and mess with the account more tomorrow.  The general them does seem to be people are happy with circle that's why I decided to switch.
