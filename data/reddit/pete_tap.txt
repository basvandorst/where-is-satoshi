What is it that you disagree with?

I do get your point about merchants not being aware that crypto was ever part of a transaction. However, I believe we could help in growing the community by making crypto much more accessible to the new user. If there are more trusted platforms making crypto as simple as possible then surely more people will get into crypto. If more people hold bitcoin then there will be more incentive for merchants to accept bitcoin (especially further down the line when the price volatility of bitcoin softens). We will release a merchant service so that they can take crypto and we do not charge for P2P transfer of crypto. I don't think one project can convince merchants to accept bitocin especially when every merchant has suppliers who want to be paid in fiat. All we can do at this time is bring crypto closer to the transaction making the final step to full crypto transactions a smaller one. With the custody, we need centralised custody to be able to do instant fulfilment on transactions. Customers can always withdraw their crypto and only use us for exchanging and fiat on/off boarding if they see us as the best option for that.

We are not out to trick people or devalue crypto. Tap was created by crypto lovers to make crypto more accessible. Our hands have been tied with certain features so that we can't make solely crypto payments. In some case because the infrastructure isn't there but mostly because vendors don't want to accept crypto, they only want fiat. When vendors start to want to accept crypto then creating a solution for them will be easy.
