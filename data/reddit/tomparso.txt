Actually just had a read through some of that thread. Brilliant! I am going to have to do a bit more reading I think. This community is starting to get very interesting to me.

I have been thinking about some of the decentralised markets.
Is it legal to use these services? 
I dont want to accidentally end up with my art on silk road or whatever it is now. Could you reccomend any other markets?
I am going to check out Open Bazaar now,
Thanks for teh reply!

I have a whole bunch of high res prints, as well as more coming in the next few days, when I actually have some time to scan/take photos etc. 
Is there any specific print or theme or anything you are looking for? or just some art? Always happy to do some personalized work if you would like something particular? honestly i just like painting, if you want something I will hook it up!

I just uploaded a whole bunch of high contrast prints to my personal site last night  . I havent been able to upload them to my bitcoin site yet as I have been busy as all F! But if you see something on my personal site that you like, I will give you a bitcoin bonus instead of using my online store. just message me with what print you dig and I will sort you out!! These are the prints 
Cheers buddy
