No. Please dont do anything so i can dump these shitcoins I have been hodling for two years.

Buy a small amount of bitcoin and then start reading.

Switch banks. We vote with our money in 2019. We speak with our money in 2019. If i dont like a bank, i dont use them. If i dont like a big box store, i don't shop there.

Uh. There are only 41 days in the history of bitcoin that you could have bought and lost value if you were still hodling.

What am i looking at?
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:43:22
Did you just take the lords name in vain?
@_date: 2019-03-31 23:25:54
Renounce your posessions and move to Nepal.
@_date: 2019-03-30 02:41:34
This is my point! Thank you for clarifying it.
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:34:55
Will you add vertcoin!?

Transactions do take seconds. My wallet shows new btc almost instantly when i send it to bisq. Exchanges and shit wallets use extra time/confirmations to protect themselves but its not necesary. Adversly credit cards do the same thing.  They just ping for valudd accounts And the actual transaction doesnt happen for at least 12 hours but usually longer.

My prejudiced mind told me: "no dont say it. Hes just small down guy. He wont get it" Im really pissed at myself.
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:58:05
This should only be three seconds long

Wow man. Are you ok?
@_date: 2019-12-26 03:02:15
Hey everyone posting that its ok because its just shills and ponzis. EFF U! Do your t
Research on what got deleted. You are uninformed.  And yes we know its a private platform and they can do what they want and we should go somewhere else. This is why were informing you that YouTube is censoring its content.
@_date: 2019-12-12 05:38:31
Good for you bro.
@_date: 2019-12-30 00:38:36
Did they pay?
@_date: 2019-12-24 12:58:51

@_date: 2019-12-04 10:27:04
Update: chatting with the scammer through a support ticket now. They are saying i need to make a .1 BTC deposit in one transaction to complete KYC. Any suggestions or just move on?
@_date: 2019-12-08 20:31:25
@_date: 2019-12-26 03:04:48
Chris Dunn is the truth
@_date: 2019-12-26 11:48:04
Can you please name one asset ChrisDunnTV has shilled?
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:45:28
I havent gotten any emails back. I got what looks like an automated response telling me i needed to deposit .1 btc to complete verification. I responded "i did" not expecting much
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:08:50
Harsh with the names man
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:03:15
Censorship is violence
@_date: 2019-12-26 02:57:54

@_date: 2019-12-03 01:37:04

@_date: 2019-12-02 14:15:50
I definetly did this
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:19:31
Yeah man. And as someone whose entire crypto portfolio equals .6 BTC, that's a hit.
@_date: 2019-01-07 04:09:20
There are Bitcoin ATMs?
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:00:48
I really think I need to start hanging out on Reddit. I try to be on FB but it's really weak when I post memes and I get one like and one person telling me that Bitcoin is used primarily for illegal transactions. ����
