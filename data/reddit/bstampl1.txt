As someone who was ready and willing to jump in last week, but has been hampered by having to wait on the exchanges to verify my identity, I'm wondering what exchange you're using.  I'm still waiting on Gemini and Coinbase

Buy! Buy! Buy! Buy!

If bitcoin isn't ever going to be a medium of exchange, why will it continue to be an asset of any value?

Actually, it can't be said to *necessarily* be a really good bet unless you've accounted for the diminishing marginal utility of the extra money.  It *may* be a really good bet for many people who would nonetheless, irrationally, decline the wager.  But there could definitely be individuals for whom the marginal utility of the extra cash is outweighed by the disutility of losing $100k.   
  
To more clearly see this, consider if the stakes were all of my $10 billion net worth versus the potential gain of $100 billion.  At that level of wealth, the utility of extra money is probably already so small.  You're probably already far beyond the point of being able to spend in ways that add real value to your life.  But the loss of your entire lifestyle would be catastrophic.  You'd be risking total ruin to add some zeroes and commas to number on a sheet of paper.     
  
Not every 10:1 wager is created equal, since the weighted value of the units at stake shifts with the scale.

I noticed this a few hours ago, as well.  Is this normal for GDAX ?

I stayed up late that night five weeks ago and bought, bought, bought in the  $3300s, as it was still falling.  If I hadn't had work the next day, I'd have stayed up later and bought more, even lower.  So, basically, my job got in the way of me making money.

I just sold all my Bitcoin to buy more Bitcoin! Moon! 
  
 Am I doing this right?
