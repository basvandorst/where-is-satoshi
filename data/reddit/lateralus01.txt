Let me ask you, what is gold good for?  What can you do with it?  Are there any industrial applications?  Can it cut through materials like diamonds?  Can it power our cars like oil?  No.  So tell me why would you pay $1600 for a single ounce of gold?  Where is that value coming from?

Christ this subreddit is supposed to be encouraging bitcoin.  What would a bystander think of this?  Oh someone just lost $4000 at the largest bitcoin exchange because he didn't use a feature that isn't well advertised.  Even though he's fully accepting responsibility people are giving him shit for being a normal person.
Doesn't sound like something I want to get into for fear of losing money and being kicked while I'm down for not knowing something that isn't trivial.

That statement at the end was misleading..

As of right now my ASIC has generated 3.68 BTC.  I break even when the price reaches $362 which it was at earlier today so why are you saying I can't break even?

very true, when I first heard about bitcoin the exchange rate was ~$2.50

You know nothing in my post blames other people.  I know I'm terrible at predicting the market but I guess thanks for making sure I know this is my fault.

No I haven't changed topic, I was expanding to try to clarify.  My whole point is that this guy lost money because he didn't use a feature that isn't turned on by default.  He is an average MtGox user.  He wasn't reckless, he acted like a majority of the other MtGox users and because of this I'm saying:
1. MtGox is partially at fault for not strengthening the default security settings.
2. Others who want to invest in BTC are getting the message that if you want to invest you have to have a better than average knowledge of these security features if you don't want your investment stolen.
3. People who are giving him shit for doing what a majority of MtGox users do even though he's accepting responsibility are being assholes because this does nothing to fix the problem and further alienates investors.
And to clarify more when I say average I mean average bitcoin user and bitcoin users usually know more about security than the general public.

You don't have to take my word for it, just do a quick google search for "why is gold valuable?".  This is the [4th link]( from that google search.  You can just read the first paragraph in grey.
The funniest thing is that gold is incredibly similar to Bitcoin:
* Both need to be mined to create new currency
* It has no intrinsic value (only old model CPUs were manufactured with gold)
* The supply of both is fixed
* It can't be counterfeited
* Once I give it to you, I no longer have it and you do.
* People will exchange it for goods and services.
Yet you sit here and and say that the people on this subreddit and the rest of the world which has decided Bitcoin is currently worth &gt;$250 million are all idiots and they should invest in something like gold.
If you can't understand this concept, you are a fucktard and I can't waste any more time.

"Yes except it took hard work to get the Gold."
It takes a lot of computing power and electricity to mine Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-02-12 23:19:37
Presumably we will also see if the people who ordered early will get them and if they hold up to expectations?

We both know gold has been valuable since long before microchips were invented.  You are right that gold is extremely stable and non-reactive so it doesn't lose its shine.  This is the main reason it's historically used as a currency because it can hold the same value over long periods of time.  But I say again that it has very little *intrinsic* value.  The word intrinsic is important here.  Oil, diamonds, food, etc. are all goods with intrinsic value which gold does not have.  Right now 1 Ounce of gold is currently worth 13.5 barrels of crude oil.  So tell me again why would anyone trade their oil with all its intrinsic value to power cars and houses for a mere ounce of metal with very few applications?  The answer to this question is the same reason McDonald's will take the paper in your wallet (which has no intrinsic value) and exchange it for food.

I should have been more clear.  I would try to get my money back through BFL first but paypal is just extra security.  My concern is that I won't have that security after the 26th and BFL will have complete control over the money I gave them.  Is there any reason to trust them with $1300 when they haven't delivered to anyone yet?
@_date: 2013-02-13 00:42:15
you have repeatedly demonstrated that you do not understand fiat currencies.  It's no wonder you find bitcoin difficult to understand.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:23:11
The problem with your analogy is that I didn't have 40BTC.  I had $1300 and I chose to invest in an asic rather than BTC directly.  And I made more than $1300 back.  Just because a better investment opportunity existed doesn't mean I lost, I just didn't win as hard as I could have.

You misunderstand me.  I never said it was hard to set up 2 factor auth.  I just did it because until just now I didn't know that feature existed.  I wasn't willfully ignorant, how the fuck can someone know what it is they don't know?!  I'm not new to bitcoin and I'm not irresponsible and reckless with security issues; most of my BTC is kept on an encrypted wallet with a very long password that I have on my PC and backed up to several places.  My entire hard drive is encrypted actually.  But I still could have lost money for simply not knowing about this feature in MtGox.  One small hole is all it takes.  We are trying to encourage wide use of bitcoin and you're here promoting the idea that we should just accept these holes in security.  When people lose money like this it hurts the whole community because it discourages bitcoin use and you want to sit back and do nothing about it even though MtGox could implement several solutions that would have prevented this from happening.

There seem to be a lot of assholes on this subreddit.  I ordered a 60 GH/s miner and I really hope I see mine soon too.
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:51:24
yea because everyone has been here for 2 years just watching every discussion.  People like you make people not want to invest in bitcoin so go fuck yourself asshole you're hurting us all.

If I had that much BTC at the time I would've bought avalon. wtf.

I don't think you understand what the 51% attack is:
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:31:42
You're being downvoted because you're fucking retarded.  Your logic is that an investment with a positive return is worthless because a better investment opportunity existed, even though there was no way at the time to know which opportunity would yield a better return.

bitcoin is protected against inflation.  The total number of bitcoins that will ever exist is hardcoded into the network:
Either way, many people see the potental of this currency which is why its up to $25 per BTC and the total value of all bitcoin is &gt;$200 million right now so you're the idiot.

The value of stocks are tied to the profits of a company and when the company has a bad quarter or loses money for whatever reason the stocks crash.  But bitcoin isn't tied to anything.  Do you not understand what a fiat currency is?
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value just as the paper in your wallet has no intrinsic value but the fact that people will take it in exchange for goods and services gives it value.
Let me ask you, why do you think the value of bitcoin will crash?
@_date: 2013-02-12 23:17:51
You think the world is just going to wake up one day and decide not to use fiat currencies despite its widespread adoption in virtually every area of the globe?  Why are you talking about countries?  Bitcoin has no native country; it is a global currency.
You know that gold is a fiat currency as well?  Gold itself is a completely worthless metal with virtually no industrial uses.  But the supply of gold is fixed and it can't be counterfeited and once I give you my gold I no longer have it and you do.  That's why we can use it as a currency.  The same principal applies to Bitcoin.

1) Create Mt. Gox account
2) choose funding options-&gt;bitInstant
3) enter your Mt. Gox account credentials and print deposit slip
4) take slip to moneygram client (cvs, walmart, others)
5) pay in cash, wait 20 mins (3.5% fee)

We both know that because bitcoin transactions are irreversible security is essential.  This is why I have much more security on my mtgox account than my etrade account.  I agree that people should expect to lose money if they do stupid things but I think we've gotten down to exactly where we disagree.  I believe default behavior should NOT be stupid behavior.  As you pointed out the average person does not use their computer securely.  I don't think that's a problem that will go away any time soon and so I believe more responsibility should be on the exchanges and common bitcoin websites to FORCE users to have long strong passwords, email verification for withdrawals, dual authentication, encrypted wallets etc.  This will make it much less profitable for hackers and allow more people to use bitcoin without fear of losing their investment.  We need bitcoin to appeal to everyone if we want it to be a viable currency and we don't want to send a message that you shouldn't use it unless you know a lot about computer security.

Like he said, have some empathy.  Wouldn't you be a bit sour if you woke up in the morning to find $4000 was stolen from you and there's nothing you can do about it? The only thing he could have done to protect himself is not making a mistake that a majority of users (including myself until today) make.  He's very unlucky, probably the victim of malware more than a targeted attack against his account.  The amount of BTC he lost just makes it that much worse and the people on here that are, in your words, 'rightly going to tell them they were being stupid.' aren't actually doing anything constructive since he clearly indicated he knows how he could've prevented this.  They're just putting salt in an open wound with no benefit to anyone and that's childish and insulting.  OP was actually doing something constructive; thanks to him making this post my mtgox account is secured.
