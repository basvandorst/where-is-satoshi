'low fees'. lol. Reminds me of 1984 where they decrease chocolate rations from something like 100g to 80g, then all the newspapers celebrate how the chocolate rations have increased from 50g to 80g...

you do realise the people who are supposedly 'coopting the hard work' are themselves long time bitcoin coders, miners, businesses, that worked to build the community (which they are now somehow coopting...)? They just disagreed with the current direction of btc, or had made investments that presupposed bitcoin was 'peer to peer cash' not a 'store of value', that it would scale in line with satoshi's intentions, that their investments in mining equipment gave them a say in the direction of the protocol (not uasf)... and so on. 
Agree with them or not, they honestly chose the name based on their fervent adherence to bitcoin as described in the whitepaper, and as it initially functioned when they built their investments around it.

An academic study showed bitcoin could have 4mb blocks before decentralisation was compromised. Since decentralisation is one important factor among many in bitcoin (such as fees) you might expect (once trade offs were made) the blocks to be about 8-12mb by now, increasing as techonology/cost allows it. The blocks havent changed from 1mb. People are now saying to use other coins if you want 'digital cash' (As per whitepaper) such as litecoin or monero - which work thanks to larger/variable blocks...

So this 'longtimer' bitcoiner is on reddit for 1 week, and happens to repeat the same talking points excusing fees, disparaging block size increases, preaching hold over using bitcoin, that I hear virtually everywhere - often from equally suspicious looking accounts. 
"I've heard many people complain that using the coins is most important, and better for Bitcoin than holding it. It's absolute rubbish." Have a read of the bitcoin whitepaper and then think about what you make of this statement. Sure, its great to hold some bitcoin - but the feeling you get from using some of it! For peer to peer transacting without intermediaries, with next to no fees - you can't beat that. It's how i got addicted to cryptocurrency. 
I would just say to new users to be conscious that social manipulation is a thing in bitcoin just as it is in politics.

It's no wonder the price goes up if someone prints 30million 'dollars' then uses it to buy btc suddenly. I just hope the tethers are backed. But then you think: do I believe bitfinex has nearly a billion dollars stored in banks somewhere?
They are releasing a statement soon, so we'll see.

Totally agree. There's nothing wrong with a HF (if that's what it is), only purists and fearmongers are worried. Bitcoin will be better for it.
