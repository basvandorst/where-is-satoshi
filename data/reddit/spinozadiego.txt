The recent IRS ruling means that people who have realized substantial income by mining or transacting bitcoins will need to pay taxes on that income - in $USD.  So they are selling bitcoins for $USD to pay those taxes by next Tuesday, April 15.
The price of Bitcoin will crater on Monday, but it will be back above $450 by April 21.

Given that FINCen classified Bitcoin as a "virtual currency" in early 2013, the IRS decision to classify Bitcoin as an asset was hardly a foregone conclusion.


The big difference here is that most people have taxable income from stocks, bonds, and gold, **because they sold it for U.S. Dollars** and realized capital gain income.  Thus, they usually don't have to sell their assets to generate cash to pay taxes because they already sold the asset and got the cash.  (I say usually because sometimes, like in the case of the Facebook IPO, a taxable event occurs w/o a cash sale and can require stockholders to raise cash in order to pay the IRS)
To the extent we are talking about Bitcoin traders, you are right, the same dynamics apply and the market would not likely be impacted.
However, with respect to miners, the IRS ruling says they realized ordinary income when awarded Bitcoin for solving a block.  That means they have taxable income, but unlike someone who realized that income from an asset sale, they don't have the cash to pay the taxes.  Hence, miners must liquidate Bitcoins to raise the cash to pay taxes.

That's probably true on a per transaction basis, but on an aggregate basis merchants will lower prices if they don't have to pay that 2-3% fee.


There are some things worth the cost of consumer protections. But a company with a solid reputation will probably institute them voluntarily to protect their reputation. Escrow functions can also offer consumer protections for the unwary.

The Federal Reserve System is comprised of 12 regional banks that are privately owned by the member banks, e.g. Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, etc.  There is no "government owned bank."  
However, the monetary policy these 12 banks follow is determined by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, which sits in D.C. The President appoints the chairman and several (but not all) members, and the Chairman periodically testifies before Congress.  Thus, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is (at least in part) a governmental institution.

Employment law attorney here. One reason paychecks come at regular intervals is because under the FLSA overtime is computed based on hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek. Computing weekly overtime is generally easier if pay checks are also processed on a weekly basis. A second reason is that most states require every paycheck come with a pay stub or wage deduction statement that shows wages earned, and the amounts deducted for taxes, health insurance, and numerous other authorized deductions for that period. Doing these calculations and preparing these wage statements every single day would be too administratively burdensome for most employers. (In fact, doing weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly payroll is too burdensome for many employers. That is why payroll processing companies like ADP and Paychex are so popular.)

I've heard the exact same arguments, but here's why they are wrong: If BTC users hoard too much money or do other things which would disrupt the utility of the currency, the market will turn to other competing digital currencies, and the loss of demand will thus cause inflation that will counteract the deflationary impact of hoarding. 
The lesson here is that BTC hoarders better not get too greedy, lest they ruin its utility, and drive the market to digital currencies not plagued by such instability. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 22:39:04
The deflation argument has been around since the dawn of Bitcoin, but it is unavailing.  
The simple answer is if BTC users hoard too much money or do other things which would disrupt the utility of the currency, the market will turn to other competing digital currencies, and the loss of demand will thus cause inflation that will counteract the deflationary impact of hoarding.
Of course people will be greedy, and people will continue to hoard. But in the past, people who were greedy with dollars or gold or other fiat currency knew that the rest of society had no option to quickly migrate to a different currency if market conditions rendered the legal tender oppressive or impractical. In other words, once I've got all the gold, everyone else is screwed as long as they are still required to accept gold. But with digital currencies, a new competitor could enter the marketplace at any moment. Thus, by picking up the excess demand, competing currencies will always exert inflationary pressures on BTC. If people start to hoard, the market driven inflationary pressures will drive down the value - possibly down to zero. 
Not surprisingly, these and other arguments pertinent to Bitcoin have been considered by others.  Nobel prize winning economist Friederich von Hayek famously addressed these objections in his 1978 paper, The Denationalization of Money.  
Economist Robert Murphy gives an excellent summary of Hayek's paper [here]( for those who are interested.

BTC may not be a good and stable store of wealth, but it has unquestionable value as a superior **medium of exchange.** Used on a per transaction basis, the risk is very small. 


I am familiar with the money supply increase versus price increase debate over the nature of inflation.  However, inflation can occur even if the money supply remains static, e.g. if another superior currency comes along that  saps demand for BTC, thus causing prices in BTC to rise.

No doubt it will be.  Still doesn't ruin its value as a medium of exchange. 


Of course people will be greedy.  But in the past, people who were greedy with dollars or gold or other fiat currency knew that the rest of society had no option to quickly migrate to a different currency if market conditions rendered the legal tender oppressive or impractical.  In other words, once I've got all the gold, everyone else is screwed **as long as they are still required to accept gold.**  But with digital currencies, a new competitor could enter the marketplace at any moment.  Thus, by picking up the excess demand, competitor currencies will always exert inflationary pressures on BTC.  If people start to hoard, the market driven inflationary pressures will drive down the value - possibly down to zero.  Unlike past hoarders of gold and fiat, the risk of zero value is a very real world consequence for those that try to hoard BTC, and combined with the inherent price fluctuations as demand grows, the downside risk will prevent small groups of hoarders or savers from "cornering" the BTC market. 
The corollary to this is, of course, that BTC should not be relied upon a store of value (although there is some medium range investment potential as the popularity of digital currency grows).

The most commonly invoked canard against libertarianism.
So you believe that without people forcing other people to pay money, we would all live in a world without pavement?  That everything would suddenly be sloppy dirt trails?  Not true.
In fact, most roads are actually paid for voluntarily by the people who use them.  For example, if you want to buy a house in a new subdivision, the developer will often require payment of a special private assessment to pay for roads, school construction, parks, and community landscaping.  No government is involved.  If you don't want to pay the fee, you don't have to live there.  Voluntary.  No coercion.

For those who say the dollar is backed by debt - you are technically right. Money is created when someone e.g. banks, loans it out to be repaid in interest.  But that is the case with almost every post-gold standard fiat currency. 
But the US Dollar gets special treatment because it is the world's reserve currency.  The United States dollar is the most widely held currency today, and throughout the last decade, an average of two thirds of the total foreign exchange reserves of countries have been in US dollars. For this reason, the US dollar is said to have "reserve-currency status", making it somewhat easier for the United States to run higher trade deficits with greatly postponed economic impact or even postponing a currency crisis.
So why does the US dollar get this special status as the leading reserve currency?
When a nation provides a reserve currency for international trade, there must be an incentive for other nations to use it as their reserve currency.  Between Bretton Woods and 1971, that incentive was America's promise to redeem its dollars for a fixed amount of gold, coupled with its perceived ability to deliver on that promise.  After Nixon took us off the gold standard, the incentive to keep the dollar as the international reserve currency was the implied American promise to provide global security, and avoiding the risk of American retaliation against nations that stopped trading in dollars.  (See e.g., Iraq 2002-2003)
So America gets to have all the guns, but we also have to pay for all the guns too.  In the meantime, the rest of the developed world gets to provide their citizens with socialized medicine and 16 weeks paid vacation and generous retirement packages because they don't have to pay $1 trillion a year for the imperial army.  They can send their brightest young engineers to develop civilian infrastructure and civilian machines, whereas a sizeable chunk of American engineering talent is devoted to military infrastructure and military machines.  Of course, when push comes to shove in the international context, the nation with the biggest gun is right, so America gets to have its way on almost any international issue.  Also, we can borrow all the money we'd like at near 0% interest rates since we're the reserve currency, and the world has to buy our debt because they don't have a choice.  Plus, if they stopped buying our debt, how would we finance our ridiculously large global military police force?  Then, once they hold a sizeable chunk of our debt, they dare not sell big chunks off at once, lest they cause their remaining dollar reserves to lose value.   
Of course, the details are infinitely more complex than I (or anyone really) could ever comprehensively understand, less like explain; but the bottom-line is this:  The US dollar is now, and has been for 40 years, tacitly backed by our promise to maintain the power to bomb any nation in the world back to the stone age.  
If you disagree consider a truly catastrophic state of global unrest.  Famines, civil wars, resource wars, failed states, nuclear armed freedom fighters, are just a few of the problems spreading violently around the globe.  Do you want to keep your foreign exchange reserves in the currency of the nation with more military power than the rest of the world combined, or would like to bet your country's enormous trade surplus on the stability of the political systems that control the Yen, Pound or Euro instead?

Right.  But I always hear from Bitcoin skeptics that "price deflation is a horrible evil that must be avoided at all costs because that's what caused the Great Depression and Japan's lost decade!" This article seems to make a good point that the really nasty consequences of price deflation (systemic defaults) are unique to debt-backed monetary systems, and would not impact a Bitcoin economy very much, if at all.  
Is this a sound argument?  Because I'd like to point this out next time I argue with Bitcoin skeptics.

The monetary system as it currently stands is based on debt.  All money that exists arose as a loan from a bank, or from a bond purchaser to the federal government.  If all debts were to ever be paid off, there would be no money.  That is why the current deleveraging we are now going through has so much deflationary pressure.  Getting rid of debt, either through default or repayment, reduces the money supply - ultimately to zero.
Since the principal amount of the unpaid debt equals the amount of money outstanding, the Central Bank must inflate the money supply if there is to be enough money to repay debt plus interest.
These manipulations by the central planners interfere with the reasonable expectations of the free market and thus deter entrepreneurial risk taking.
