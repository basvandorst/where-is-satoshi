Wasn't there an official announcement that coinbase would list Bitcoin Cash? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:14:25
Well that is shitty to add that the blog post was edited later in the story. I guess I should've re-read it all again. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:41:53
I've been doing this for a year. Every week I just send $50 over to coinbase with their recurring setting. I like the fact that it helps keep my price per bitcoin closer to the actual price. Every once in a while I'll buy more. Good luck to us as I really believe in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:13:15
Just for arguments sake. The satoshin email is from before the satoshi address sent out the Bitcoin white paper. Not sure how that all factors because I know nothing of the Bitcoin climate before 2 years ago.
@_date: 2015-12-09 18:21:51
I got to go back and read because I thought it was a blog post or something that easily could've been verified. I should've gone back and reread the article before posting this, but I'll come back and edit.


I'm assuming that says that there is a 2008 blog post that has a PGP key that is tied with satoshin I don't completely understand the circumstances. So if anyone can please tell me why that doesn't mean much, if they care to.

My favorite moment was the bull run near the end of the year and I hope in 2016 we get a consensus on the block size debate.

Relax, you took a half serious comment as if the guy was completely serious about it.  Go re-read his first comment as if he was high on laughing gas.
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:31:30
Haha, I had to force the seriousness out of him and that was my best attempt.
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:31:05
Of course it will.  I put myself on the line to look like a genius or an idiot and the latter is a lot more realistic.

Or you can ask and hope someone isn't an asshole and answers the question.  Some people are new to bitcoin and it's confusing as hell at first, let's be helpful even if it's the 20th time someone asks.
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:28:51
You could've just downvoted, commenting rudely without knowing the users situation makes it an asshole comment.

I posted this 4 days ago after the op proposed mtgox had a brilliant plan in mind. Of course I know the ultimate risk is losing all my money.  In the last few days we've seen stories about how mtgox maybe setting up to fold like full Tilt Poker and also have horrible explanations for what has been going on.  At this point I'd probably only trust $2 going to Mtgox. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:05:04
I like what you said but be sure I don't think my example is a good idea just trying to explain what I was thinking.  Again what you said is perfect. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 21:33:02
In my initial thinking that means that he bought for lower than the current value.  If he paid more then the price would bounce and I'd assume he'd like that.  The government will release the price so I'm not sure why he's being hush hush.
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:24:31
I also heard overstock is using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:12:32
Not sure exactly how you stated that differently from the article but it made me understanding. Thanks for that.

That's a little disappointing.   I hope Bitcoin doesn't become partisan though it fits nicely with Anti-IRS conservative view of converting to a flat or "fair" tax.

It will when upvotes are converted to bits.
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:35:18
Yeah I came to write something similar and saw your post. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:13:05
The US seized 30k bitcoin from a drug selling website.  They went to auction where they sold the 30k bitcoin in blocks of 3k.  People or companies that ponied up 200k for the US to hold (escrow) were allowed to bid in a silent type auction.  Highest bidders of each block won.  SecondMarket setup a system where people could bid through them (I believe) which had a lot of interest and all their clients were not able to be the top bidders.  That should mean the price for the auction went for a decent price but that is pure speculation.

I'm deciding on how to buy $5k to $10k of bitcoins.  Should I buy from Mtgox while they have the prices so low?  What are the risks if I went with them?
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:51:30
I can respect that.
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:06:17
This is very cool.   I always pictured something like this to give more value to just sharing or upvoting content. The tipping via changetip was a good start but it was a little cumbersome. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:10:01
You bastard (I'm jealous)....I bought at . 07 and .055.   Today was finally a good day.
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:32:39
Imagine getting one satoshi for every upvote.  Of course the person who gives the upvote would be paying for it, unless you earned your own satoshi's.

@_date: 2014-07-10 02:02:18
It's probably just for your notes to help you remember where you sent your bitcoin.  Instead of leaving it blank just put in a period or any character.
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:00:51
I agree and stated so, that's why I asked if anyone could come up with another way to achieve the same goal.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:19:18
With these big investment firms looking to get in the game it's not crazy to think they are figuring out ways to drop the price before they get in. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:57:20
That's a shitty reply.   Either you're dense or being an asshole.   Let me reword just incase you're dense.   Why is there a spike of sellers recently?   Thankfully intelligent people answered already. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:03:33
I don't like that amount, unless it was mine.  I'm sure it wouldn't help the value at the time.
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:08:42
So you think the best method to educate grandma is to find a negative in a positive news story?  Of course it's a bit of a circle jerk here.  If you go to don't expect to see pissed off people when someone posts a picture of a nip slip.  If people are only going to see Bitcoin tied to drugs from this story then they have a lot to learn still but at least they keep seeing "Bitcoin" in front of them. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:47:24
This was posted because 12 hours ago OP offered 35% off via twitter for using cryptocurrencies.  
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:15:46
I say the winning bid comes under current value around 600.  People will think that is bad even though that is great and the price goes to around $600 then we'll see a slow steady rise back to $650 where we'll sit until the next great news.  So $600 just because of the unwarranted panic sell.
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:22:44
No need to search for sell bitcoin because buying is the first step.   If you know how to buy then you'll know how to sell.

I get your question and would like one as well.  I buy a lot between .2 and .5 and would like to know my average price per bitcoin without going back doing a lot of legwork.   Might just be best to sort bank statements with coinbase and divide the amount of Bitcoin you have.

Yes. A wall can be in either direction. On charts they look like walls since it takes a large/multiple buy or sell to go over or under the wall.

I wonder if some of the losing bidders are now buying chunks of bitcoins to replace the bitcoin they were hoping to get with auction.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:57:16
Let bitcoin be traceable for now. It will keep countries from banning it or putting hard regulations on it. The programmers will event ways to wash the trail. You can use an over seas exchange to convert it to another crypto then buy back bitcoin and I believe that will reset your anonymity. Im sure though systems will be in place to make it happen. For now bitcoin needs to be easy. As it gets easier adoption will increase, just look at email and the internet.
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:00:55
That's done, they came out with another ban story or two and the price stood still.  There hasn't been a news report since.

Angry much? The correlation is likely. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:38:01
Angry much? It's a bitcoin subreddit if they feel they have something useful to post let them. Never does it suggest he's self entitled to upvotes. He simply stated there were a few odd things and that last year the same post was upvoted. They're not advertising their service, they're advertising a contest that you may be interested in. Something tells me you don't browse coinbase's blog, so a post here would let you know about the contest they are running. Is that really so harmful? If it makes you feel any better this post will be buried tomorrow.
Coinbase has been good for the bitcoin community so give the company the benefit of the doubt.
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:59:20

It completely misses the fact that the last bubble was just bots that went crazy. The best thing about the $1100 bubble was that it got a lot of people interested in bitcoin, like myself. With all the exchanges out there now it's very difficult for bots to drive up the price now. I'm hoping next halving will give a nice little bump to the price.

“The companies that invented and deployed those two features did so in 2012 and we reap the benefits today."
He mentions that after brining up HD and MS wallets and right before bringing up the 2 year (2017) date.

I know of no libertarian that has an issue with renewable energy. If they were they are only mad at the subsidies not the technology. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:48:44
I think that's a fair assesment. For mass adoption they need to figure out how to make it easier.  In a parallel I think like what DNS and DHCP did for the internet.
@_date: 2015-02-09 02:31:12
He used an example, that's not pulling it out of your ass. If he just said I think it's going to take 2 more years then that would be pulling it out of his ass. He essentially said he believes a lot of great things will come about in 2 years since that's how long it took other bitcoin technologies to hit mainstream. Maybe we have different definitions of "pulling things out of your ass". I feel it's blindly throwing out figures with no references. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:46:01
He didn't pull it out of his ass. He clearly explained that it seems like it takes 2 years for adoption of technology based on Bitcoin. Stating that we now use HD and MS wallets and it took about 2 years for them to be widely used.  This year half a billion was thrown at Bitcoin and he assumes in about 2 years the technology they're developing will be mainstream.  Please explain how that is out of his ass?
