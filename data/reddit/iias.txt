Honestly I see a much larger value in Bitcoin for the very wealthy in the UAE. When they discover Bitcoin has no borders and the store of wealth is wherever you can access the blockchain. This will open the eyes of many.

I hear what you are saying and tend to agree with most of it. The problem is it isn't a stock or bond either so market cap doesn't seem to fit for me. I understand it does show the value of the holdings in fiat which is helpful but for me there is just something missing in this measurement or perhaps it is more the way people view it.

Agreed, last price does provide the value in terms of market cap. It is traded between people so the value is derived from trade. Perhaps market cap is the optimal way to look at it. I don't know what it is but for me something is missing in that understanding.

It is true there will only ever be about 21,000,000 bitcoin so there is that. Yet, I can see the world depositing at least as much as the top five bank hold into bitcoin as deposits on their money.

Market cap does show the current total dollar market value of available bitcoin so in that sense it does work. It is the mindset of looking at it like a stock that gets me I guess. Perhaps that because I wonder how that works when the tables are turned. When assets are valued in bitcoin.
