The difference is that untenable dangers are introduced (theft) and capabilities removed (digital transmission) when one chooses to keep all their fiat in cash. 
Coinbase is not as necessary to use bitcoin practically as a bank is to use fiat, although it does offer certain conveniences. Consider also that coinbase rarely goes down (when compared to this bank), and almost all services are available 24/7.

I was implying the reverse actually, that their company is doing poorly against Amazon and the Bitcoin move may have been out of desperation.

I'm starting to suspect he's not very realistic, and that smells of desperation to me.

Do you believe credit card companies pay more in covering theft than they make by taking a cut of every transaction? Of course not, they must make a profit. Consumers are paying for it one way or another, and the 'benefit' of having Visa pay for it if you get robbed is an illusion.
Bitcoin is still in the early stages. As it becomes more widely adopted, innovations like specialized hardware will help people use it safely. Coinbase's 2-factor authentication is just the beginning.

Zero in Celsius is really useful because it's the freezing point, whereas Fahrenheit's zero is pretty arbitrary. I find that reason enough to make the effort toward switching. We may never succeed in switching our minds to Celsius, but if we keep the thermometers in Celsius the next generation surely can.
Being different from the rest of the world has its costs, too. Engineering mixups end extra computer code, for example.

Credit card fees to merchants are far higher than what they pay out for fraud. I see your point, that consumers don't mind paying a 2-2.5% fee on every purchase and are used to it, but consider that there are already (mostly online) merchants offering to give that back to the consumer in the form of a discount. If Bitcoin grows some and ~~Walmart~~ Overstock.com begins offering 2% back when you use Bitcoin, you can bet Visa will need to change or die.
Bitcoin is also objectively harder to compromise. There's nothing vulnerable about the data that moves in a retail bitcoin payment. Very different from credit cards. It is easier to protect a private key than it is to ensure secrecy communicating your credit card number to the point of sale.

It's not free because merchants must charge the consumer more to cover that cost. With credit cards it's just hidden from the customer. This is why you see "minimum CC purchase $5" at gas stations, and it's why some businesses give a discount for using cash (or Bitcoin)
Companies like Coinbase, whatever their individual conduct, are not a problem. The important thing is to have an open market with low barriers to entry. This way, if there is something screwy about Coinbase, additional demand for trading services will cause a better competitor to arise. Anyone can set up a bitcoin exchange. This doesn't happen with credit card companies because you can't just start your own credit card company and expect it to work at Visa/Mastercard terminals around the world.
Credit cards predate the internet. There was a time when Visa's network was a really valuable thing, but now that we have the internet to communicate transactions with, there's no need to pay Visa any more.

This is relevant. If Target were operating on Bitcoin, they would only need to protect their wallet private key. There would be no CC information to steal, and all the customers would be protected regardless of Target's infosec practices. This regards the long-term utility of Bitcoin, and thus the value, and yes, the precious price you're so obsessed with.

The information on your credit card is equivalent to a Bitcoin private key in that anyone who obtains it can make a purchase as you. In the credit card system, Target gets a copy of all this information, and anyone who gets control of Target's computers can have it too. A hacker attempting to pull off something like this with Bitcoin would have to hack each and every customer individually. Hacking Target would give them access to Target's money and nothing more.

While I don't doubt that our politicians hold bitcoins, I'm not convinced that the motives you describe would outweigh the advantages they currently possess and which bitcoins threaten. They are currently at the top, and a very different group of people will take that place if bitcoin replaces the dollar. 
My confidence comes instead from imagining the scenario any one country faces if their economic partners adopt bitcoin. Even the mighty USA will need to join in eventually, and until they do bitcoin will flourish in the rest of the world anyway. The most efficient technology wins eventually, and that's going to be bitcoin for a while.
