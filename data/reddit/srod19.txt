Yes, happens to me on both mobile and desktop.  AFAIK the fee for a maker on BTC is 0.25%, tested on a few of my trades and it seems my maker fee is .25%.

Correct, and IIRC Coinbase disabled adding of new CCs, they only allow debit cards.
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:18:15
Well if you max your cc out that’s one thing, but I put everything on cc and pay it off each month for the reward points and what not.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:47:38
Haha thanks. Maybe I'll win.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:03:36
Consider if I asked who is closest to the actual value? 201 wins.
As far as I'm concerned, your competition was to guess the closest number to the actual bitcoin price on 9/1, which I did and was the most accurate.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:17:04
In my opinion, if you buy in now you're still buying early.  So don't waste the time looking for a dip in the price, just get in and hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:23:56
But when the competition is "who will be closest to the correct number of apples", the person who guessed 201 wins.  Your competition was to "predict the price" aka provide the closest value to the price point on 9/1.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:27:49
I'm agreeing that his range contained the actual price, yes. I disagree that he provided the most accurate prediction in relation to the goal of the competition. I gave a single value that was 32.05 different from the actual price.  Given the circumstances, this was much harder to do than providing a range of +/- 200. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:14:45
I picked the most accurate price. So next time, i'll just pick $0-$1000000 and hope for the best.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:49:04
I would've though closest price point would win over a $200 dollar wide range. Also, I was only off by $32.05, he was off by $33.11...
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:17:14
I just don't agree with that logic.  His guess was less accurate. Even if you took the median of his range, he's still further off than I was.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:41:35
Should just split the prize .05 to each.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:55:22
There's my address for anyone interested.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:13:11
8151.63, but do you want a range or a price prediction because that apparently means different things to different people.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:05:09
Exactly my point that a single price value guess should trump a range.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:35:25
It's just disappointing that I was checking the price all night, thinking to myself holy shit I might win this, i'm 32 bucks off, then waking up to see someone who threw in a wide range guess further off the actual price win it.
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:57:16
I opted for a single price range because anyone below my comment could just tighten the bounds by one cent.  From my interpretation of the rules, and apparently a lot of other people who commented, a single price guess was acceptable.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:19:44
Ahem, it's actually called bitcoin cash not bcash  /s
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:52:31
Nicehash pays out in BTC, so for me it's just convenient to avoid selling the altcoins on exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:06:35
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:33:58
You're not using the word "correct" right. The value shouldn't need to be within the range to win. The winning guess should be the closest one to the actual price, high or low.  I urge you to reach out for a second opinion on this.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:52:01
Well, let me know.  I'll pm you.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:16:01
Some people are interested in mining.  For me it was a learning experience that got me into bitcoin in the first place, i was just giving some tips for anyone interested.  My advice is: If you're interested, here's what I do. Nothing more.  Also, i'm in a hotel for work, so the electricity is free.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:43:55
Although I appreciate the honorable mention, I disagree that 101111 is the winner.  I was under the impression that the closest guess would win.  My guess was 4815.162342, 101111's was a 200 dollar spread of 4750 to 4950.  Although 101111's range contained the actual price, it was not the most accurate guess.
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:22:33
Unfortunately, not many close to you.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:33:04
Which, for me, is totally worth it.  For others, probably not.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:55:56
True for most, yes, but i'm in a situation where electricity is free, so why not mine a little bit. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:06:26
The way bitcoin is going, yes it feels great.  As far as how the winner of this competition was chosen, not feeling so great.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:42:34
It is for the most part, the main program runs instances of CPUminer and other programs based on the profitability of each algorithm.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:04:44
I'm not paying for electricity at the moment, should've mentioned that.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:51:35
My argument is: being "correct" was not the point of predicting the price.  A prediction competition should be whichever guess is the closest to the actual value, high or low.  The person who predicted you would have 201 apples is the closest person to the truth.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:21:06
Perhaps robbed isn't the word, but the winner was picked poorly.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:57:46
Very good explanation, thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:00:42
My range was 4815.162342 to 4815.162342, although the actual price was not IN the range, it was the closest to the value.  Take the apples example OP used in the results post.  If he has 199 apples, someone predicts he has 100-200, another predicts he has 201, which prediction is most helpful?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:53:29
Why not do both?  I learned more about BTC by getting into mining with my GPU than I did throwing a few dollars into coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:24:17
Yes I understand that there is a more profitable way to mine/sell altcoin with a GPU, this post was not intended to be a "How to make the most money mining with a GPU".  It's much easier for me to click one button, walk away, and get a payout in BTC to my trezor once a week without thinking about it.
