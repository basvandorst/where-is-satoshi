You don't need a blockchain.info wallet for transparency. You can just post any address, and people can look it up on blockchain.info or blockexplorer and see the transactions. That's not something unique to blockchain.info wallets.

If you're a miner, it would be beneficial to pay your electricity bill with bitcoins. If you were to convert your bitcoins to CAD through an exchange, the fees would be more than what bylls is charging.

It's because with 500€ notes, it's much easier to transport large amounts of money.
This is why Canada stopped producing our $1000 note, it was being hoarded by smugglers and other criminals.

Why would you keep $1m worth of bitcoins on a smartphone wallet? 
Edit: that's the analogue of keeping a $1m bearer bond in your pocket at all times. There's no way you would do that.

I paid two credit cards so far. worked perfectly, Even paid the wrong one, E-mailed them and had it correctly applied to the proper account. PAyment showed up within 3-4 business days. Definitely a little slower than my typical online bank bill payment but it's a start!

I just signed up. There's no real way for me to see on your website if the transaction has been confirmed by your system or not. There should be another two columns in the "Payment History" where it verifies if the bitcoin payment was sent properly and also if you guys submitted the payment. More information you give to your customers, the less they need to bug you.

Yes they do have an API, bots are highly guarded, expensive if you can get a dev to sell one to you.

What's your config file look like? What kernel are you using? Try messing around with vectors or vectors4. 
@_date: 2012-08-17 14:01:37
This will kill trading on the site. Their site is the easiest way for me to be a manual day-trader using bitcoins. If they charge 3% commission, they are going to scare off a lot of small traders to larger sites. I will continue using it because I've already got so much invested, but I see this as the killing blow for them.
400% increase and a blow to their customer base for government backing -- something bitcoin is trying to make obsolete. I don't think they get it.

Try using Phoenix 2.0. Sounds to me like you're using the CPU not the gpu.
@_date: 2012-07-21 18:50:28
Its been a bit since I used phoenix 1, but try adding VECTORS2 or VECTORS4, to see if that makes any difference. I really prefer phoenix 2 simply because it has a configuration file. Lets you quickly change options without having to bother with the CL.
Also, since the card isn't supplying the display, try bumping up the aggression to 12 or 13. That's the max I've been able to get stable on my cards.

It works! Thanks! I talked about cold storage.
@_date: 2012-07-22 17:16:58
Change the autodetect field to -cpu, you don't want to be mining on a CPU.
Also you need to change the fields under [cl:0:0]. I'll give you an example:
    [cl:0:0]
    autoconfigure = False
    kernel = phatk2
    name = GPU 0
    start_undetected = False
    disabled = False
    worksize = 128
    vectors = True
    vectors4 = False
    bfi_int = True
    aggression = 9
    fastloop = False
    
    [cl:0:1]
    disabled = True (comment: if this is the integrated graphics that you want to use as the desktop.
Edit: If you have further difficulties, I would suggest asking over in or at bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2012-07-16 22:31:49
Where is this deadline mentioned? I did a quick look around their site and couldn't find it.
@_date: 2012-07-17 02:14:22
That person keeps buying out those that are lower than their price then relists at a slightly higher price. Or that's what I think. It's someone with a relatively large amount of capital managing to take extreme advantage of this surge, leaving small players like me out in the cold.

Beware of how many ports you can use on a hub. Depending on the output of your power adapter, you won't be able to run all those ports full of erupters. For that hub you would need at least a 5v 5A power supply.
A consolidated list of known hubs. I personally use D-link DUB-7 hubs with only 6 erupters.

If WU just started accepting bitcoin, this would change the game entirely. Say you could. Go down to your local WU to sell coins to get cash. Or buy some to send to a relative. They could take a premium on top of the online exchanges, but that would be a fee of convenience. So handy, I think.

Ads and bloatware that is included in the installer. Any time a dev tries to trick me into installing "ABC super awesome internet search toolbar" I immediately trash their software and go to the competitor. Same thing happened with utorrent. They tried adding some stupid program in its installer, so i switched to qbittorrent, almost the same as utorrent only none of the ridiculousness.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:51:39
This is redesigned. You should have seen it before!
It's not that bad, IMO. Not as fancy as some, but it works. They don't have the volume to warrant spending lots of money on frivolous visuals. I'd rather they focus on the back end and getting API access that will attract more business (day traders, etc.)
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:20:01
We need to not perpetuate the old style mantles for financiers in bitcoin. Terms like "insider" sounds elitist and malicious, because in the traditional finance world, insiders have inside information and thereby hold power over others in regards to financial gain. There are no such people here in bitcoin. No one can hold that power, it's just not there.
It's in our human nature to want to bestow names on ourselves in order to "distinguish us from the rabble" but that's kind of the point of bitcoin, no? We're all the rabble.

You will notice about 15-20 mhash/s increase, if not more. You have to be willing to tinker with the settings.

Here's a good tutuorial on getting bfgminer up and running
No. Don't use GUIMiner. It's good to see if you want to mine, but it is far from the most efficient. Also, make sure you're not using more electricity than you're making in bitcoins. (
Try bfgminer, it uses a .cfg file you can edit and save your settings, so you can just open the .exe and start mining. Have a look around bitcointalk.org's mining software forum, and you'll find plenty of help there.
Run the client with the options like this either in a command prompt or from a shortcut:
    bfgminer.exe -o mine.mtred.com:3333 -u YourWorkername -p WorkerPassword
Once you're in the program, and you see your cards spitting out shares, pres "S" then "W" and hit enter twice to get back to the main screen. This creates a config file, saving all your settings. Now to run the program in the future all you need to do is run the .exe (no need for the extra options now)
To change anything, now all you have to do is edit the bfgminer.cfg Make sure you don't mess with the formatting, however. If you want to learn how to properly format it by yourself, look up JSON formatting. The easiest way to add more pools (for backup WHEN Mtred goes down, etc) is from bfgminer itself by hitting "P" then "A" and follow the onscreen prompts. once your new pool is added, make sure you save your config file like we did before.
For how to squeeze every last MH/s out of your chips, you'll want to fiddle with some configuration settings.
In your bfgminer.cfg at the top should be your primary and backup pools, followed by something that looks like this:
    "intensity" : "9",
    "vectors" : "2",
    "worksize" : "128",
    "kernel" : "diablo",
with a bunch of other options at the bottom that you don't need to change. You can mess with the intensity, 9 is the max you'll want to go at all, but if you still want to use the desktop that is being rendered, you'll want to go down to "d" which is a dynamic intensity. Try modifying the vectors try out 1, 2, 4, and 8 to see what gives better results. Worksize is the same, 64,128,256 are what you should try. Kernel is a big one I think the default is "poclbm" but i find diablo has given me better results. If you're running a 7000-series try "diakgcn" that is designed for it.
Play with these settings, edit them, save the .cfg and then hit "S" "B" and "Y" to quickly restart bfgminer without having to open the .exe again. You'll have to do this lots of times until you find the right combination of kernel, vectors, and worksize that works for your GPU.
Once this is done, get MSI Afterburner to Overclock the core as far as you feel comfortable, while also lowering the Memory Clock to lower power usage, as Bitcoin isn't memory intensive like other cryptocurrencies. Afterburner makes it easy to have multiple profiles so you can easily switch between mining and gaming.
I think I've covered most of it, hopefully this has helped.

AFAIK you don't need a special program for 50BTC, just a regular miner you point towards their server.
You should also stop using guiminer, look at cgminer or BFGMiner, much better hashrates for a properly configured miner.
