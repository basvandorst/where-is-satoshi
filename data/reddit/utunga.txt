Weird. I didn't see any warnings like that (I'm pretty sure). Maybe I left too much guff on the end of the thing. Somewhat moot point now I guess.

such depth..

Can't tell if you are serious or trolling? It's just a simple consulting business. I've been doing this for 10 years or so  with mainstream banking system nothing illegal about it.

In other words. A bitcoin investor who has already demonstrated really bad market timing - having bought at the high and hung on to their BTC over the last 9 months of dropping prices - is suggesting that right now would be the time to get out. Should we treat this as a signal to buy or a signal to sell? 
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:30:07
Yes. I agree completely, your initial point was actually v well thought out* and I can see why you'd want to err on the side of conservative estimates in this case.
EDIT: *better reasoned than what I said to be honest

What's super duper lame about bitcoinsymbol.org is that just like the symbol itself as a website it also completely fails to render on my phone..  Just a broken plugin icon. 
At least with a website they control they could detect my device and render a png or something instead but no. It's like they honestly failed to think about one of the most important things when trying to push a new symbol. Just a total fail.

Awesome. Thanks!

Ripple is a fundamentally distributed protocol. Lot of confusion mixed with paranoia and knee-jerk reactions going on here.

I'm not against KYC restrictions completely. Just want to keep hassle to a minimum and find the draconian bullshit (not to mention the rates) from Western Union a bit off putting.
If you've ever tried to open an account that lets you buy BTC with USD when you are not a US citizen you will know what I mean about hassles in that regard.
Localbitcoins.com, unfortunately, doesn't have the volume for reliable/competitive prices in NZD market yet.

Well yeah it was posted a whole two hours before I posted this.. but when I checked new I couldn't see it so yeah, figured I'd get the word out.

When talking to reporters you need to remember that every individual sentence may be taken out of context and quoted individually. It's unfortunate but it's just the way it is.

I'd say less than 1% of the value of gold in the market is due to it's usage in industrial manufacture.. and if you took out the value due to MLM like speculation it wouldn't cost so much and then would would have way less 'value' as a form of jewellery as well.

Check out the most recent message on this thread originally from 2009, and who it's signed by..
@_date: 2016-06-25 23:25:03
yes. this is fine

Weird how they think your balance is 31.17 but the max you can withdraw is BTC 0.3117

... if someone can find the timestamp to where he said exactly this in that video can they please post just the quote to wikiquote too..? I can't see it on this page  but admittedly on my phone just now, so ...

It's kinda noticeable that you didn't actually answer the question here...

A great summary. Also worth noting that a huge amount of what she was saying was essentially a big plug/advertisement for Digital Asset Holdings her 'no crypto' ripple clone startup 
@_date: 2015-11-13 20:07:11
Thanks, yeah, that's why the comparison to ripple. Also on first glance their diagram thing included a 'consensus algorithm' rather than a block chain.

Normally I'd agree but in this case an exception is appropriate. If you have never visited this sub, trust me, u have no idea.

This. We can't expect them not to follow the law but can demand more transparency - if they want to be part of the bitcoin community - as to what will trigger the 'sorry it's not us it's them' lock downs. And also some clarity on how that will work, what measures they may take. For instance whether they will freeze btc balances outright, without warning or whether they will give you a warning and then let you drawn down slowly etc.
