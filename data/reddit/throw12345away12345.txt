You're right. I'm a horribly misinformed idiot. Cheers for explaining it in a clear and non-abusive manner

If someone wants to buy 27k bitcoins on an exchange, the price would raise a crazy amount as demand would be huge. So getting them slightly above current market price but outside of an exchange is actually cheaper

I think that means that the product is currently in the US. Bad wording I know but I think they meant "its either made in the US or it is here now"
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:30:43
Well that's silly
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:27:04
And he comfesses
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:27:14
But if they control 51%, they dictate what is valid
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:11:20
What does that have to do with it? I'm not trying to be rude sorry, I genuinely don't see the link

I can see the new slogan now:Bitcoin: for porn and drugs
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:10:52
That's not what he said at all. He said that people choose to do shitty things that they wouldn't have if drugs were legal.
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:56:08
If they control 51%, then they control what the block chain thinks is real and what is not. They just write into 51% of the blockchain that you sent money and everyone else will change to be the same since they are the minority

These are the SR coins, not the ones on ross's pc

I think I live in a bad place :P
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:59:35
But that's not happening. The 27k aren't going to hit an exchange to be sold. That means if you want to buy 27k btc from an exchange, you would raise the BTC price.This isn't about flooding the market, its about whales buying in. This is just a way for a whale to buy in without raising the price for himself/herself.
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:31:56
To be perfectly honest, I first bought BTC to get drugs but I kept buying it because I simply liked the whole "decentralized internet money" idea. Obviously I know a little more about it now haha.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:33:39
So they are just going to throw away millions of dollars? Suuuuuuuure

I'm not sure what's happening for you, but I have used coinjar.io (havnt used the .com) and have had everything go through with no problems. But I have never left money or btc on coinjar for more than 20 minutes
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:20:04
What does that mean? :S
@_date: 2014-08-27 06:22:20

I think I've missed something here. Is that relevant if they are just going to immediately buy Bitcoin with the money anyway? Or is this about evading income tax?
@_date: 2019-12-10 01:50:10
Why not just work for cash and buy btc? You'll end up with more
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:33:14
Its great to see that the BTC community isn't just in it for the profit! I love everything that Seans Outpost is doing! When I get home from my holiday I will be sure to send some BTC his way

You think that's bad? I deleted a wallet with 50btc in it back in the day because I thought it was worthless

Ooo, that's good to know!

As long as it's mining btc worth more than the power that you are using, its always a good idea imo :)

He said that he missed the opportunity AND he might lose the $2000 that he deposited as well. I read it how you did too the first time.Have a good one :)
@_date: 2013-10-17 00:40:26
I'm sure he wouldn't do that just on the off chance that he ends up getting sent SR money
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:33:51
Yup, that's me. I deleted 200-300 in 2010

Do you think that mixing services have a malicious BTC maximum threshold? Like "if 10,000 BTC are in system, cut and run with the profits"
@_date: 2013-10-17 00:54:31
Haha Ross is secretly technologically challenged and his local PC repair guy is the REAL dpr who planted everything on him.

Good to see that Australians are adopting BTC. Best of luck with your business
@_date: 2013-10-07 05:47:22
I always explain bitcoin like it is a tradable commodity than a currency. Everyone tends to become extremely sceptical when they hear about "anonymous internet money"
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:53:38
Dammit, he's making us look bad

Oh well, I'll buy a single btc one day, for retirement purposes

I'm not sure if donating BTC is tax deductible

What would interest me is finding out how much potential money someone could have made so far if they bought 1 btc the second that it hit $1 and had perfect knowledge of the future marketFor the sake of impressive figures, assume instant buying and selling

I think he was talking about the US trying to crash the price instead of making money. Because really, what is $150million to the US government? Depending on how much they hate BTC they can dump alot more into crashing it.Edit: Note that I have no idea what I'm talking about
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:15:58
Thanks for answering! I've been wondering about that. How did you go about working that out? :)

You missed the point, you can just buy the BTC instead of paying for parts or electricity

I understand that, but the idea that someone "invented" money instantly sounds like a scam unless you want to explain it in depth
