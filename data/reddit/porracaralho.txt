Actually, from all alts, dogecoin has more chances for success as an internet currency, exactly because it might be a bad investment, because it allows an annual inflation of 5 billion coins each year, forever.
It'll make people to use it rather than hoard it, spreading its distribution and adoption. It is fundamentally different from bitcoin in the long run.

The last bubble that came down from its highest of 32 to 2 dollars over a year and stayed at around that price for another year, if you believe that will repeat, then expect the price to fall and flat between 50 and 100 dollars for the next year, and maybe in 2017 there will be another bubble, or just be forgotten as other coins start to run their own bubbles. Who knows

Not really, the biggest flaw on general economics is that prices can change despite its volume, scarcity or abundance, otherwise speculation would be impossible. If reaches 10000 or 10,per btc neither is representative of how many dollars entered or exited the system. The price of bitcoin can be anywhere.
I believe that bitcoin will stagnate like it happened before 2012, until all the bad newsy reputation of bitcoin rests, and it might take a while...

What is that 7 TPS limitation? Does the btc transactions get slower as the network grows or is a constant? That would a silver bullet on any global currency aspiration... you know, the word Currency means in Latin *flow*.

Let's be frank, Facebook is buying out the competition. How many billions will last to buy out every new threat?
The dotcom bubble is very similar to what is happening now, Pinterest is valued at billions without any revenue, even without any priority into the 'mobile ecossystem' Holy Land. 
Most probably all these mobile markets will be eclipsed by new and unexpected platforms. cloud/decentralized services working everywhere besides your phone are already the next thing. 
What you said is the same logic that drove the dotcom bubble, that you buy a share not based on what the company is or its revenue, but on its share on the 'ecossystem', with the illusion that the company will grow together with it. AOL had something like more than half of the ecosystem one time... this market doesn't work this way, like an allotment of consumers that you can buy, it mutates too fast. It destroys entire markets before one can make a dime.

It is even worse, if bitcoin gets popular enough, a ransom in bitcoin will be asked even if the victim doesn't have them. for any criminal, in any activity, it is much more advantageous than any other form of payment. It might become the biggest reason for a general public ban on bitcoin

In economics, intrinsic value is value on itself, gold is different, for example, from dollars, because the dollar value is based on the confidence that US will always pay its debts. The world met a lot of reserve currencies like the dollar, they all disappeared in history once the confidence eroded, besides the paper, a dollar note has no intrinsic value. All the while, since history has been written, gold, (and now oil) was exchanged because it has value on itself, like any other mineral. Even water and food have intrinsic value, it does not depend on confidence or perception, only on its scarcity.   
To understand this difference is essential to evaluate (and speculate) companies and stocks.

Err, gold is conductive and unlike copper, it is corrosion resistant, besides, no other metal has its ability to deform and being non toxic. Of course it has intrinsic value, especially in our electronic times.

Of course it is incorrect, Bitcoin is flawless. Surely that is entirely possible for the blockchain to grow three orders of magnitude faster, and is easy to make fundamental changes without any fork, just like the malleability flaw that was corrected three years ago.

Shit, you are the first one in this thread to say this so far... 
He said just that: "Bitcoin *was* reminiscent of music sharing sites Kazaa and Napster ...that helped spawn legitimate sites such Pandora and Spotify."
He implies that Bitcoin is not legitimate, in another words: it is against the system, and will be replaced by another (acceptable) solution.
Even if he was thinking about using bitcoin, he would never tell us until a formal announcement! It would spike its prices violently. 
Anyone can create their own cryptocurrency (to try to get rich?). What would stop PayPal to develop one that governments and banks might accept?

ITT: Everyone hates Paul Krugman
Let me say this in his defense, One, in 1998, pre-dotcom crash, Nasdaq was surpassing Dow Jones in value, AOL and Time Warner merged as if they were equals, Spielberg coming out on TV to say that everyone will lose their jobs because Internet, including him. In 1998 the american economy was thriving, the wars were stopping, and the Internet would transform the world with a frictionless economy with no boundaries. In 1998, the planet seemed to be taking off towards a new clean start, and the Nasdaq's climbing, exponential growth would catapult us there. 
Two, that didn't happen, at least how as the most people envisioned and the dotcom bubble burst badly. Suddenly people perceived they will have to keep their jobs. Internet did become the most important communication tool ever created, probably bigger than telegraph and the phone... but economically it didn't created much, piracy undeniably hurt the industry, there is no model of advertising that is profitable (facebook overvalued much? there is might come a dotcom bubble 2.0 lurking around); heck, Reddit, one the most popular sites on Earth, needs 'Reddit Gold' donations from its users to keep afloat.
The comparison does sound unfortunate today, butwhen  the dotcom enthusiasm was reaching its summit, everyone called him crazy at the time.

Merchants want to sell, payoff their taxes, their suppliers, their employees, and that means they want dollars. If they wanted to invest in bitcoin there are easier ways.

From what I understood,  the sum of it is meaningless, Incoming BTC means how many bitcoins crossed an 'entity' which hold several addresses, one of them is the MtGox, that is an exchange and was nearly a monopoly in 2012 but transacting only two million coins out of eleven million mined. As of 2012, nearly the totality of the mined bitcoins are out of circulation, yet those dozen entities are the ones that transacted them, pulverizing it into random addresses, mostly to hide the few true owners.
I'm not defending or attacking the paper or the bitcoin, it is just my interpretation. and trying to find the truth.

Advertising is a byproduct of mass media, and it will die together with it.
Why do you think that Google is suddenly entering the robotic industry? They might have seen an opportunity that no one has, but is just more probable that they are diversifying to get out of the advertising business dependence as fast as they can, to be more like Apple, where the revenue comes from selling hardware (or do you think that Apple made money with music/iTunes? less then 3% of the music on ipods were legal, the real business was the ipod itself).

What piss me off is this ideology that all problems of humanity comes from government... while is the absurd concentration of power/influence/money that fucks up with countries. 
The high concentration of bitcoins in the hands of very few repeats the same deadly sin, the bitcoin revolution that people want would be more about Animal Farm than fighting 1984.

That's the worst argument that Inflation is a good thing. 
What makes Inflation a good thing is that rich people have to divert investments into real productive things instead of sitting over a mountain of money. 
Now it is not something that poor people can do, they are the ones most hurt by inflation and interests, that if they spare money they actually lose money, if they enter in debt they lose even more.
But a minimum of inflation has to happen, otherwise money/gold/bitcoin will promote money hoarders, making everything else more expensive to everyone else while not producing a damn thing.

Is that put as a Myth? Really? One of the major forces driving quantum computing is cryptography. The same driving force that created the modern computer in WW2. 
And about update the bitcoin for quantum-cryptography? Are you saying that an average user will have access to one? It will take decades, maybe a century for a quantum computer to be affordable at home (and would we really need them?) after banks, corporations and military agencies to have them. 
I don't believe that it will happen soon, but to say that it is a myth is highly questionable.

I know that this not the place for being critical of bitcoin, since you guys are so aggressive to defend bitcoin, anyways... Bitcoin has the same problem,  only on a lesser visible degree now, the great majority of bitcoins are held by few people/entities. All the pump and dump schemes that we clearly see now with alts tormented bitcoin in the early years before becoming the golden goose, where the big holders sell smaller and smaller bitcoin fractions for a bigger and bigger amount of dollars. They control the market, they control the prices and the exchanges. While the whole majority of people has between 10 to 100 bitcoins, the few big players hold 100.000 to 1.000.000. The alts are all reproducing this unfair money supply, which I think is the killer kiss for all hopes and dreams to have a stable and just monetary system.

Adi Shamir, the 'S' in RSA (and one of the guys that hack a computer using just the sound of the CPU) did a cross reference between all bitcoin addresses a little longer than a year ago and uncovered, for example, one top player holding nearly three million bitcoins, besides a dozen other 'entities' that monopolize almost the totality of bitcoins mined.  I discussed about this already here, but it was dismissed as fud as usual and [his paper]( keeps largely ignored by the bitcoin community. People still keep saying that no one has more than one million with no evidence whatsoever. Just curious from where it came from.

Technology advancements happen besides anyone's will, the more disruptive they are, major is the change in society for the better and for the worse. The internet disruptive and revolutionary as it is, helped our lives as much as it destroyed jobs.

The author seems [to be a reputable cryptographer, co-inventor of the RSA algorithm]( anyway, even by your optimistic numbers (around 2M), it is about 10% of all bitcoins that will come into existence, even with your number this concentration of money is proportionally 100 times higher than the world richest 1% wealth concentration. The study shows that the group that started bitcoin purposely transferred bitcoins into thousands of addresses hundreds of times to mask their operations.

I understand that, still, the profit margin for most retailers is very thin, if they want their business to grow they need to reinvest that profit, and again, they need dollars. Why they would gamble their business with bitcoin? It would be reckless.
