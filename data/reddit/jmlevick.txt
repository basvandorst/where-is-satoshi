Yeah, that's what common people tend to do, that's "securing the near future" more than seeing the cars as a better store of value than keeping the money in the bank I believe those people think "better spend now than later, because later I might not afford that car with that same amount of money". But we might never know exactly.

I think this should have more upvotes.  Even if Bitcoin was the ultimate wealth storage, during an economic collapse people rarely have any wealth to store and I doubt (given the rocky story of XBT) that they might flee to our currency once again. Normal people will spend their money securing the near future (food, overall wellfare etc) and those who have extra money (wealth) will secure it in properties, funds, etc. ASSETS. Only a small percentage of common people will flee to FOREX and from those an even smaller percentage might think to flee to Bitcoin... The thing is, it is highly probable that you can't buy anything using XBT there right now.

These services are awesome. Here at México many employees have this problem you see, sometimes American companies hire Mexican employees (working at their Mexican headquarters or so) for the same wage they would hire an American employee, but by the time the money reaches México a good piece of it is loss in the transaction (many blame corruption to an extent, who knows); However the problem I see with many of these "bitcoin killer apps" is that they're not solving a real painpoint at the moment, so it might be difficult for them to thrive and/or take roots inside of the already well built systems... I mean, a lot of them are like bitcoin itself: Many people say "Bitcoin it's money!" Yeah, but... I already have money, Why would I want "better money"? (Not me, I love bitcoin, I'm talking about the average citizen at any country).
The "painpoint" here (for example) is the dissolution of the money, which is something **the target** audience isn't suffering from (The target audience here are the employers because like it or not they control the money and they pay the wages); Most of the employers listed on their page are bitcoin enthusiasts just like us, but for the average employer out there if the money dissolves or not it is the same for them, they're spending the same amount every month anyway, the people are just recieving more or less depending on many factors and this will continue to be the case... Now, if corruption *do* play a part in the dissolution of the money (on some cases) then those employers will never embrace this killer app because it gives transparency to the process. 
And employees? Well, they might like the idea but at least here at México, when you're hired as anything that involves a payroll, the company gives you a company payroll card and bank account, why would they undergo the process of registering at some service to recieve their money? Right now they don't have to open a bank account, much less care about it if the company closes or they are fired, bitwage might seem like a lot of hassle to them.
That being said, there are A LOT of *killer apps* out there really "killing it": Here at México we have "Jaime" a bitcoin powered service that lets you pay almost any basic service (I'm refering to bills here mostly) via Whatsapp. That's actually useful. I remember a time when I was little and my dad had to open me a bank account at other city, then mail me the card to my city so he can help me pay some bills of things I enjoyed (internet, cable); I needed to call him every month, then go to the bank, then pay the service. If those times were now, I could simply send him a scan of the bill every month and he could pay for it via whatsapp using bitcoin. How cool is that?

In this case (Bitcoin) the fixed limit makes sense because we are talking about a payment processor/currency. The benefits of a "flexible data structure" (no cap, yay!) would be quickly outranked by the overall cost of maintaining the network "spam-free"
TL;DR: on this particular scenario, maintaining an adequate "spam filter" on a model that has no transaction caps would be *expensive* on many fronts.

I know it is kinda "bleeding out" but I have faith in the technology... My reasoning is that even if BTC "bleeds out" in 2015 it will eventually rise as it is positioning itself more and more as the "de facto" currency of the internet. one of two things might happen:
1) Either BTC grows stronger or
2) There will be a "way out" to make your old BTC count in the future.
I think this because I know a currency based on the blockchain is here to stay, also because nothing was perfect on the first try, Bitcoin has a lot to evolve yet. As far as I know out there some entrepreneurs are building services to back your bitcoin with gold, am I possitive? Also, even if value of BTC decreases but some other crypto seems promising you can always enter early with your BTC savings.

Thanks for the advice!
Is there a way to buy/sell gold (for example) vía the internet with your money much as how you would buy Bitcoin? I ask this because here at México I have bought "Onzas de Plata Libertad" from the banks (silver coins) and altough is fairly simple to buy them, at the moment of selling, NO ONE (at least at the banks) want to give you even what you paid on the first place for them (they'll just keep making excuses until you accept a very low price in comparison with the market's one)

There is a romantic comedy with one known actor (can't remember the name) based upon this sort of concept dunno if Jennifer aniston appears there or I'm confusing it with "My girlfriend Polly" but... If I were you I'd investigate more about how these kind of insurances work because I mean your value proposal at the moment seems really vague, if I need some advice about anything I just go and post on the correct subreddit and get advice, safety measures, tips and more about any activity from a random stranger on the Internet without liability for them if I die or not. Consumer wise it's a weak concept because paying just to access the wisdom of the crowds it's not really plausible, there's reddit, my friends, Google, etc. 
The "risk factor" focus seems vague to me, however customers putting money in a bitcoin pot to glide the best advice about different sections of a peculiar activity with the revenue stream for you being selling the big data gatherings and findings resulting from that (maybe to insurance or traveling companies) seems doable... But it will not be an easy "quick money maker" endeavor.

1) All the Changetip transactions (for example) are "off chain" and people do tip a lot, small QTY's and large QTY's.
2) I don't think bitpay is a good measurement  for "commerce" transactions because for example here at Mexico using bitpay as your Bitcoin POS/Payment processor is not a good option, we use BitsoPagos. 
3) When I eat at my favorite Bitcoin cafe here at Mexico, I don't pay through bitpay either.
4) I invested $100 USD in trading when this year started and made $35 out of it. Built a trading bot with Ruby that made the work for me. My bot trading directly instead of me doesn't mean I wasn't "using Bitcoin" on those days.
5) Sone merchants offer a bitpay/circle/coinbase option on checkout with different prices on each on them. Sometime people pay with the one that offers the better deal.
And finally... Some people don't use Bitcoin to buy stuff so much. Me for example I use it more for peer2peer transactions in order to send money from my country to another and pay outsource employees.

I'm thinking about that. Yesterday I was invited to work with a startup that has an algorithm for NLP, so I'm thinking about testing it with this "hunch". However here it's 3:00am and everyone sleeps. I can't seem to find the thread I'm mentioning on theymos post history and it might be gone because of the new rules set on this subreddit (y'know 'everything about the blocksize debate shall be purged') but I'll go to sleep and tell the others to help me test the message in the morning, first to see if it DO match with satoshi's previous writting style, then to test the theymos theory (the one where he wrote that message).
P.S. "For example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network"
"Anticipate &amp;amp; Pooled minnig" that's the exact terminology I remember theymos used on the thread I'm mentioning. (I haven't finished reading the "satoshi" when I first commented)

Well, that's the general "consensus" (more like hypothesis) on this debate, but as I stated on my post above, nothing prevents the losing side from effectively becoming "an altcoin" so it's users, node operators and miners keep thriving on it's ecosystem. As cryptocurrencies are (at this point) mostly speculative assets, people will "bet" on both sides buying "Bitcoin Core" and "Bitcoin XT", making all the distance we have traveled together worth nothing... If that happens, we might end with the "bitcoin distros" scenario where every one has a different vision, and none of them work together towards mainstream adoption, leaving bitcoin as this "awesome geek experiment" which get's used as "the backend" of other (more successful) endeavors (just like Linux).

This is the most accurate ELI5 answer for this type of question. Compression on crypto  stuff (OP said random but whatever) doesn't achieve anything much than adding a lot of overhead to an issue easily solved by other methods... It doesn't matter if it's the best algorithm out there, you'll achieve nothing unless you control huge portions of the process, (a "compressed" sidechain it's kinda feasible for example) but doing that would take more effort and would be less reliable than just increasing the limit.
Dunno if this was a troll question though haha, hope not.
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:34:11
I don't think so. I'm not a copay dev myself, but take a look at this comment:
it is safe to assume that there's no way for other person (different than you) to get that GUID (and second specific private key in the case of copay) as at the moment of it's creation only you and your devices "know/see" it. Also, it seems completely impossible for any kind of attacker to spend your funds. See my other answer on that comment's thread.
@_date: 2015-07-21 10:03:24
I don't know how this actually works in Copay but from the info you provided it seems a little like a TOTP setup (think Google Authenticator):
For multisig (shared wallet) I have to sign a transaction on 2 or more devices for it to pass through, am I right? it then seems like the QR you mention it's actually a GUID token for the wallet that gets "tested against" some validation algorithm to determine whether if the device at hand belongs to the shared wallet or not. All this can be done locally without "a cloud" or even Internet, (just as in the Google authenticator) so I think each device holds it's own private key and do not share it, also there's no "master" one with all of them, there's just a GUID that identifies the shared wallet across devices and each device sign the transaction on it's own with it's own key when it's needed.

Hey just went into the Copay github repo and saw that the android app *seems* to have passcode/pin functionality but the iOS one I have on my iPhone doesn't (v. 1.1.1 I think); is there something We (and I) are missing here? Older tickets seem to reference PIN support on iOS, did we lose it?
EDIT: I'm aware you can protect your private key (and thus transactions) with a password, also the backups. We're looking for the PIN functionality to lock the app.
@_date: 2015-08-06 08:03:14
There's a service called BitPagos that allows this worldwide (for a commission a little bit higher that the normal CC transaction of course); for a Bitcoin only POS I recommend bitpay if you're on the U.S. Or something local if you're on another country. In Mexico we have BitsoPagos (different from BitPagos which I mentioned earlier) for example

Yeah, the "copy to clipboard/send by email" for the backup (on mobile) makes no sense to me. We're talking sensitive data here! But then again you can encrypt both the backup and your private key with passwords.

I'm on mobile right now, but I remember reading a post here by theymos that used a lot of that writting style (on the comments) and that particular phrase you're quoting, he said on one comment something along the lines of "Satoshi and I never foresee the centralization of mining" I've been following the controversy that fell upon this sub since the censorship and I'm pretty sure this mail reminds me of theymos writting style. Call me crazy (as I dunno about his background) but when I read that thread I can't find right now, for the way he defended Bitcoin core it even crossed my mind the idea that maybe he thought he was satoshi (or he actually was) but then again, he never used any technical language on his comments (quoting code or processes in an specific manner) so I discarded that thought and stuck with the idea that he was a little too "power trippy".

@_date: 2015-07-21 23:51:34
I'm not the copay dev, but... off the top of my head, I understand this:
There's no way "an attacker" can use your funds. Period. As said on his previous comment, having a multisig wallet with copay **doesn't** share the private keys of the devices with one another and there **isn't** a "master" device with all of them. The system works with an ID and a private key DIFFERENT from the one that signs the transactions on each device, we have two things here:
- 1) The ID
- 2) the OTHER private key for the shared wallet
As I understand, one of these two things is random, the other thing must be a constant so the devices from your multisig wallet can identify themselves as "legitimate members" of such wallet (also you have the public keys, which in theory are all derived from the wallet's private key and can "recognize" each other from "intruders", but take this with a grain of salt or two until a copay dev comes along and elaborates on the subject).
I hope a copay dev clarifies this further, but it sounds to me that the only way "an attacker" could use your funds would be for you to add them directly into the multisig wallet and then, signing (agreeing to) the transaction on the majority of devices. So, there's no "attack". You must consciously allow someone to spend from your multisig wallet.

So I asked to the exchanges in my country and one of them (Volabit, dunno if they have a reddit username) told me about "BitPagos" which is a platform that does exactly what I need but with (obviously) high fees (5% per credit card transaction, free bitcoin transactions according to this article from a year ago:  So I'll check them out and see if it is an option or I'll just change my strategy to use the more "in-house" approaches that my local exchanges offer.
@_date: 2015-08-06 00:15:42
I'd assume it's sorta "public domain" thing. Satoshi posted it online for all of us and if I remember correctly from the "The rise and rise of Bitcoin" documentary, he expressly said everything in regard of Bitcoin was intended to be Open. Legally, you can quote it, remix it, and do all sorts of things with it, because as with the code satoshi made it but released publicly with that "spread" purpose. If that wasn't the case we might not have seen Altcoins born because the code, the technology and everything that has to do with most cryptocurrencies has it's roots on that whitepaper.... As with everything on the internet that's shared in a similar fashion I think it's safe to assume you can do anything with it except claiming authorship over it. Ask on the mailing lists to verify what I'm saying.
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:53:32
It works the same for all adblocking systems and... The redirection happens because I have some sort of fallback mechanism in place: as the website it's stored on a SOHO server if such server goes down the TLD links go down too (showing the "502 error" on Cloudflare) but the blogspot links keep working as expected (That's why I posted the blogspot link). When the server it's running fine you're redirected from blogspot to the TLD domain transparently.

Yeah, Passcode == PIN, isn't the same as the Password you use to encrypt the private key and broadcast transactions, or the Password you use to encrypt your backups :)

I'll make an instructional letter programmed to be sent via e-mail (alongside a Twitter notification) in the event of my sudden death to a specific person (or group of people)  so they can know how they can retrieve my important data (such as my Bitcoin seeds) and how everything works. The feat it's simple: it's just a pubSub server/client arrangement where my computer holds the client and sends a ping to a Google App Engine/Heroku (for example) server every time I boot it. If the ping isn't sent in a week or so, I'm likely dead and, as my hard drives are heavily encrypted there would no way to boot/re-login into my user to fire/re-fire the ping without having me there... Either if I die and the computer it's left ON or OFF the condition would be met and in a week my loved ones would  experience "P.S. I Love you" geek-style.

Yeah, the requirement here is to avoid the devaluation of the VEF (Bolívares); So he wants to protect his money by receiving USD. For what other people had told me, I think paypal would be the best vehicle here as (in theory) I can use an American Express card to send him payments in USD and he can recieve the money there in USD via paypal. Then he can get it out via gradual transfers to his bank account without falling victim of devaluation every day.
A similar thing could be accomplished by using Bitreserve, but in that case I would have to buy an amount of bitcoin diluting his payment by 10% (here at México that's the fee) that I then have to pass on to him, so he can exchange those bitcoins for VEF and dilute them more. That's not practical, it's basically the same than sending him an international wire transfer with more hassle added...
So paypal it's the solution in this particular scenario.
