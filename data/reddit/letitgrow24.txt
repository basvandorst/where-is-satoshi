Lmao. That ending. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:09:17
They have and it’s clear as day. I ain’t gonna waste my time digging up research I already did months ago. 
Have fun in jail buddy! 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:47:11
Yeah sorry but you are wrong. Every trade is a taxable event. Doesn’t matter if it’s converted to fiat. 
Good luck to you though! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:07:17
Yeah... I guess you missed the point. Didn’t need to get a lecture. Was basically saying every time the market is doing well they seem to come up with this stuff. Same repetitive crap over and over. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 01:06:38
Which article is fake?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:25:24
This sounds a lot like Bitcoin Cash.... ��
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:33:15
Disclosure, I know it’s fake but thought everyone could use a good laugh. Lol 
@_date: 2018-05-20 12:43:18
You have to pay crypto to crypto as well.
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:34:55
Worked for me... I paid like $7,000 in realized Capital gains. I figured better safe than sorry. A few years from now if I ever make some serious money. They can’t back track to when I first got it and hit me with penalties. 
You did the right thing. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:51:52
I’d ask you about your Bitcoin to distract you from my real interest in what you are storing in that safe! 
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:08:39
This whole time... it was a Bollywood film. lol 
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:52:21
What about what the technology allows? These uneducated people need to stop talking about bitcoin when they only see some digital asset with no fiat value.
They fail to look at the technology that is what makes Bitcoin worth what it is. No one knows what the future will hold but blockchain isn’t going anywhere and Bitcoin is the store for those future values. May not replace fiat but I am sure it will be accepted for those who choose to. 
Unlike Gold it’s easy to do the conversion and accept it casually.
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:30:18
Nice find! 
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:49:41
He said you can’t stop bitcoin... now what? 
@_date: 2018-05-15 15:03:04
The bubble isn’t in Bitcoin. With as many people there are in the world they are placing themselves to own one of the greatest assets in the future and there isn’t enough bitcoin to go around. It’s going to cost a lot of money. 
I am buying projects based on real world value on what they plan to do. Many companies will fail but that’s the gamble. Bitcoin is a store of value and the writings are on the wall. 
Do average people buy Gold and store their value in in? The average person is buying bitcoin because it still has a ways to go and offers a lot more as far as the future running on technology and ease of value transfers as well as security. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:24:02
Ledger or Trezor.. and not from amazon. Remember this is where you plan to keep your jewels, your gold... the access to everything you own. 
Is a $100 one time fee a lot to spend for that kind of security? 
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:17:48
Lol. Just saying cause damnnnnn that’s a drop and I just through in 5k this weekend alone. 
I honestly think sideways and reversal soon. Unless this Rupee stuff gets out of hand. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:47:32
I think now we are seeing many support blockchain but not bitcoin so they don’t seem like they failed completely when both succeed. Lol
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:40:34
Man I wish I remember what happened when it did to me. I think they only sent me 1 deposit and then a few days later the other showed up. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:45:35
Enjin’s wallet is one to look into. Has eth erc20, bitcoin, litecoin... all in one and so far it’s rates as one of the most secure mobile wallets in existence right now. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:51:43
If that’s accurate I am fucked. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 01:06:56
Coinbase? ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:10:10
@_date: 2019-10-07 17:30:16
Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin and bitcoinSV is the real bitcoin cash. What a shit show. Lol
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:29:43
If $100 is a lot then you must be keeping under $100 on it...otherwise I don’t see how it’s expensive to secure funds more than its worth. 
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:05:30
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:25:41
Kidding me! I sent to the wrong one!
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:53:34
70% from ATH... it’s still up over 100% for the year.... 
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:03:47
Put on your fun caps. We’re on our way!
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:41:45
There’s someone interested in something. I think it’s smart then put into majors on my own if it were me.
@_date: 2019-02-08 21:09:43
I was going to post but couldn’t find the words. Then I saw “hey, there’s one comment” yup... these are indeed the words. Lol 
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:23:51
@_date: 2019-02-04 15:17:17
This needs more upvotes. Good job posting. I feel so bad when people lose money to this kind of stuff.
@_date: 2019-02-26 22:47:12
I thought they withdrew application?
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:01:31
Not for nothing but I hope you have the $$$ to pay the taxes in those realized gains or you with have some trouble down the road. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:53:50
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:05:15
You miscalculated a again. Only 1 s9 will produce .10 BTC not 1 whole one. So you have to multiply your daily by 10 which is $34.10... 365 days for the year to produce 1 BTC at current complexity $12,446.
See it’s not far off at all even with your lower cost. It’s still very expensive. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:22:56
Okay. Send me .10 BTC once a month for 10 months. Then I’ll give it back and you saved money..... lol 
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:34:32
My bad. So you are saying no matter how much electricity you use. You only pay $3.41? 
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:54:42
It’s different in every state. Where I live it’s a lot more money. It’s $18,000 where I live with 10 Antminer S9’s at current complexity.
What are you using to get it for $1,600? 
I pay $0.16 per kilowatt.... 1292 w each is about $50 a day x 365 $18,250 for one BTC 
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:10:43
I forgot to mention that you’ll never get 1 BTC at the end of 887 days. The complexity has change so quick lately. In July there was like .10-.12(for the year) more btc that’s gone now and it’s just going less and less by the week. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:34:28
This guy is an asshole. Hands down arrogant and wouldn’t even hear answers to his questions. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:12:21
You can have them. Lol... at least not in this area is it the best. Wish electricity was cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:58:41
666 is actually a good number. I think it means angels are watching and pointing to changing direction in life. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:03:06
Yeah same here. No one cares and everyone at work bashes crypto as having no value because it isn’t tangible. ... shrug... that’s on them I suppose.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:57:26
 Never gets old! 
Legit checked volume on CMC like 30 minutes before this pump and checked back and it added like $2.5 bil in less than 30 minutes... holy crap! 
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:46:57
I was referring to dollar volume for the day. Which doesn’t matter market cap. But a lot of money was spent in a short period of time. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:44:04
Same man. Same... One big mind fuck. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:15:10
Yeah but common sense says that after watching it between 6-6.5k for weeks then you see 7.4k it’s kind a bummer no matter how you look at it. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:13:44
I am not sure what you are referring to but I was talking about bitcoins volume for the day. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:29:29
666 actually means an alert to make a change in ones life. It’s not bad at all. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:12:39
Clickbait.... your post doesn’t at all say why the ETF will not be approved. Just says your opinion about how you think a manipulated market is still in bearish times. ��
@_date: 2018-07-17 13:10:07
But is it really resistant or do they just call it that?
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:32:24
I need a pullback to finish loading and my friend who ignored getting ready early on just got set up and verified and boom took off without him
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:08:18
I too woke up feeling a little bigger myself! 
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:52:22
Anyone who downvotes this makes me feel we lost our way in the crypto universe. We should be embracing things like this. I know if I spent the time I’d want to be taken seriously. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:41:45
That’s not access to your wallet man. Access to the wallet is having the private keys to move those funds wherever. 
Watch only can’t do shit.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:50:06
Says the guy who supports a service that just decided to screw everyone with more fees. Then bashes the one thing that make PayPal pretty much useless? 
Yeah... no one sees the agenda here. ��
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:48:36
Same here. Never works in my favor and when it does I am too blind to see. Lol 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:10:38
The better question is why they keep having that hack of a woman in every bitcoin/crypto segment and she still doesn’t even understand it to ask the right questions. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:34:37
Would you blame a bank hack being the cause of why fiat is vulnerable? 
Everyone in crypto should know what to look out for and careful. Many use their amazon password for Coinbase and their bank accounts...
You can’t change that some don’t take extra precautions and go the lazy route.
Myetherwallet for the longest time made it very clear in every way they could that they are not a bank and just a way of access erc20/Ethereum tokens. 
They could have more protection against attacks but that doesn’t make crypto “vulnerable” 
@_date: 2018-04-21 17:47:32
It’s easy for them to ban it. They could say it’s a terrorist avenue and all address and digital currencies must be reported ASAP and to cease trading as of _____ date_____...
The only thing is Wanchain will be like a crypto bank that can add a privacy layer over non privacy coins so funds could be safe there while waiting and hiding until whatever blows over.
I can’t seem them shutting everything down though. It’s been agreed on pretty much all over the world blockchain tech is where the future is headed. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:06:09
This is legit disgusting. ����
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:04:23
Or maybe interest in Alt market more than thinking of crypto as “Bitcoin”... early on I researched bitcoin more than I do now 100%
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:32:44
Yeah I agree. I had like .66 at one point last year and just needed to know what it felt like to have 1 BTC. Then after I went into alts and figure if I don’t have 1 screw it. So now everything is in alts. 
But I still watch my overall BTC value to not dip below where I am willing to lose. 
PS I am one of those weirdos that don’t like to own in odd numbers either. lol 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:56:52
So you are saying this guy didn’t actually make the app? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:32:13
Damn... that’s a lot. Used to be cheaper and I remember paying not much in fees when trading ETH. 1% ��
