I know you are just kidding about having all the BitCoins because I have my .0102 on my own paper wallet protected, created on a virgin laptop that I bought and destroyed just for BitCoin.
But I think it's unwise that you make jokes in the position that you hold.  There are a lot of noobs on here that don't realize that you really don't hold all the BitCoins on your laptop.  You're supposed to be in charge!  Act like it.  You don't see Jeff Bezos making jokes about his inventory.   CEOs need to have some dignity and not be jokey-jokey, especially when it comes to other people's money.  
People don't always get jokes.

If you happened to glance at the private key, then maybe hypnosis can pull the private key out of your brain.  I'll help you, for a small fee of 30%.  Ready?
...you are getting sleepy...
The private key starts with a "5".       
I did my part.  Please fill in the rest.
