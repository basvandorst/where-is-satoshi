No, but they would be likely to stop buying larger and less necessary items.

Sarcasm? There’s no reason Bitcoin should be seen as a mathematical function growing exponentially. The market is wild and unpredictable.

who hurt you

$ is not a static unit and this is the problem with inflation. It decreases in value but you don’t really notice it instantly as there’s nothing to compare it to. But the price of everything increases as the buying power decreases. Sadly we don’t really know of a way to combat this yet.

Right, the problem is, I can’t easily see bitcoin be used as a currency if:
-	it keeps increasing—this is the issue with deflationary currency, no one wants to use it if they know their 0.01 bitcoin will be worth 10x which then will be worth 100x as much. Right now we’re in a phase where it’s not widely adopted yet but it must plateau at some point as this kind of growth is simply not sustainable. I can’t easily see a bitcoin hitting an equivalent of a trillion dollars in the future.
-	it’s still shit to pay with—I’m personally excited to see where Lightning Network will go but there are other currencies that are better for payment, such as the quick-fix Bitcoin Cash, which, love it or hate it *does* offer faster transactions and lower fees, or Nano, which is basically instant with zero fees. I wouldn’t be surprised if a coin like this took over in the long term.
-	it is continued to be treated as an investment and not a currency, which is the case now
On top of that, are you sure if gold has exponentially increased in value in this fashion before?

How many did you lose?

I don’t usually run that much stuff on my CPU but I’ll try. Thing is I have an 8-core Ryzen so it’s hard to choke unless you literally run something using 100% of the CPU on it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:29:34
Never had issues with it when I was using it. What specs do you have? I've got an 8-core Ryzen 7 so...

I’m retarded. I stand corrected although he still did pay another guy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:49
He didn't get the pizza directly from Domino's, he paid some guy on reddit to send him the pizzas. No clue whether he still has the BTC.

just let us be happy about owning like 0.013 of a bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:03:33
I’d even be happy about 120, it’s in fact worth like 5 bucks but Ethplorer bugged out and showed it as being worth like 145K at some point. CMC doesn’t even list active exchanges for that shitcoin anymore so chances are it’s not even traded on EtherDelta anymore. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:17:17
Nano? It's built on a block lattice which is entirely different from traditional blockchains and allows for instant transactions with no fees and scalability only limited by hardware, with no mining taking up massive amounts of electricity. But no altcoin is as battle-tested as bitcoin is, especially an altcoin based on a completely new system. This is the main advantage bitcoin has over other altcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:09:18
This actually happened to me when I tried to sell a bunch of airdropped etherdoge that Ethplorer made me think was worth $120K. Sounds like a shitshow.
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:25:16
I don't know much about etherdelta, can you enlighten me on what you mean?

I’m down! I do UI design in my spare time, DM or chat if you want to see my work
