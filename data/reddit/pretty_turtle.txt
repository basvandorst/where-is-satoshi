This is why the crash will be big.  Those who bought in early 2017 are cashing out while they still can exit with gains.  Those who bought in late 2017 are cashing out before they lose everything.

Go back a month and anyone who didn't agree with this statement would be shouted down around here.

You're half right.  It went mainstream but it brought in the mom &amp; pop investors.  Coinbase was adding 100K+ users per month in the end of 2017.  The day before the first spike to 20K it was all over the nightly news.  Mania.

Most of those people bought in early enough that they haven't lost anything yet.  Need to reinforce that ponzi scheme yo.

And this comments proves your lack of self-awareness.
This sub brings back fond memories of 1999 when my neighborhood barber would give me unsolicited investment advice. (yes that really happened, lol)

I see the hodl meme as a symptom of large numbers of people getting into bitcoin despite very little knowledge of investing period.
The dramatic price increase over the past few months is mostly due to bitcoin going viral and not increases in actual utility.  There's a ceiling to that growth and it will decline as people realize they won't get rich off bitcoin.  Those gains go away if people abandon bitcoin en masse.  It's as much about people protecting their own gains as it is helping others.  (If you've you mortgaged your house to buy BTC you should sell the BTC and pay off the mortgage cause holy fuck that is a stupid risk)
Early adopters may have intended to invest in a financial revolution but what they really invested in was irrationality and greed of others.  
I'll give you this.  If I had been on reddit and known of this cult like behavior a few years back I would have bought a lot more BTC than I did.

The fact that the term HODL even exists is proof that it's a ponzi scheme.
