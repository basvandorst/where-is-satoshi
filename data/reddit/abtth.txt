I agree with OP.
Most popular belief is that you're in control of your money. But people are scared. The masses are scared. They are not ready to control their own money.
Many stories show us how irresponsible people are. Getting scammed... And who comes to the rescue? Right. The banks (and the government); blocking your card in your name and in most cases even rollback the stolen money. Last important case was the 'lost' cheque in Canada worth half a million.
The masses do not care (asong as there is no significant problem).
With the masses, I mean US and Europe.
On the other hand Bitcoin can be a hedge in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, etc... Countries where corruption is more visible than in countries who have strong military apparatus (because I believe the corruption is widely spread). The only difference is in Western countries corruption plays behind the curtains.

@_date: 2018-01-17 00:32:48
In the unlikely event that miners stay away for a longer time. That means hash rate will drop. Then difficulty will be adjusted. Less miners will earn more bitcoins (with lower value). Network will be less safe (lower hash rate).
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:43:21
The biggest flaw bitcoin has, is people expecting it to reach 500,000 before it's deemed as successful.
Why does it need to reach that value? Why can't other cryptocurrencies co exist?

If the government implies bans on stuff such as 'snakeleather', or 'fishing in January' or 'hunting in April' or 'downloading software' or 'falsifying documents' or 'counterfeiting money' or 'selling between 10 am and 11 am' or 'bitcoin' then the clerics have nothing to say (as long as it does not go against their religion). 
This all falls under the obedience rule. They can not be disobedient in Islamic law (if it does not go against their religion). Of course they will do that, they are just human. Humans steal, lie, fight, fraudulent, etc... but the point is: it is *not according to Islamic law*.
Another concept is 'obedience to the mother' (in Islamic law). It means if she forbids her kid to deal in Bitcoin then he should not, because that *is forbidden by Islamic law* (as long as it does not go against their religion).
I agree that they should not say it is 'haram'. Maybe he said that, maybe he didn't. We should have the original text/audio. It is quoted as 'forbidden', which has multiple meanings in Islam.
It is also mentioned as 'forbidden by Islamic law'. If the government declares it illegal, then it is *not according to Islamic law* to be disobedient (as long as it does not go against their religion). It also looks like the cleric is specifically talking about Egypt? He could not talk globally since he's not authorized to.
I'm not sure if it illegal in Egypt?

People (the Bitcoin communities widespread) are responsible for this system. Because they are the ones welcoming and using the. Believing in a fairytale so they can feed their greedy inner souls. Because tether gave them a promise, a contract, as they will get tetherdollars as soon as they hit the button. And every airless digital tether is backed by another airless fysical dollar.

It could stay 10 years around this level, people asking when it will rise...
It could rise instantly to 20k then 30k, people posting meme's and people buying fear of missing out...
It could stay this price and drop 2k and then stay another few months/years on that level.
These simple outcomes should be stickied without too much rambling about how it could go either way. Maybe insta remove topics asking about price to r/garbage, this way we remove 50% of current topics. And also insta move meme topics to r/jokes, this way we keep the interesting 2% topics that really matter.

Surely global world powers can come up with something? It would be naive if we think they will lose... Why does Bitcoin need to hit 500,000 if demand and supply stay the same?

You will find it, it will probably cost you thousand bucks to be a millionaire. But that thousand bucks will first do nothing. Then 'crash' shaking of weak hands. Then rise making you think you reached the top. Then stay steady for years. Then suddenly rise, rise, rise or even pop down and then rise. Check Google and Amazon in the early days. They popped too. Bitcoin? Popped too.
So not sure what you want... Because apple explosively rose back in the days but they were not like super special? Touch phones already existed. And apple has zero experience with touch phones.
So? What you're basically asking is what are interesting opportunities that could pop or rise. Huge risk, huge profits. Low risk, low profits. 100 investments, 1 will win.
Do you have what it takes to take on this journey?

Wishful thinking.
The reality is that they could all co exist together 10 years from now. The reality is also that Bitcoin can bring it's promise at 10,000 bucks if there is no significant exponential increase in supply or demand (works either way).
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:12:20
Usually they come back up, slightly above their level. This means you earned more profit then staying inside Bitcoin.
1 Bitcoin for 10 altcoins
1 bitcoin for 20 altcoins when Bitcoin rises
1 Bitcoin for 8 altcoins when the altcoins stabilize again
There was one topic in here from a guy who was really disappointed investing in altcoins and showed us they all went down (for a few months). I guess he's really happy now.
His protfolio consisted of Monero, LiteCoin, ZCash, dash etc... They all proved to have multiplied more than Bitcoin.

If more people mine, you are getting netto less coins.
Years ago the coins were worthless. Best way was to buy them. But if you were already invested then best way is to mine them.
So depending on total hashpower, your 'share' in the hashpower. Your buying costs. Your electricity depending were you live. And last but not least, the market price.

It can track but it can not stop you from letting do your things. For example if you want to send someone in Singapore money. You need various validation methods. If it's all legit, and everything is fine. Then it's your responsibility and you should be allowed to send your money.

Have you analyzed the Bollinger band, Fibonacci retracement and moving average indicator? The simple moving average points are traditionally succesfull, but Bitcoin is a new dimension.
Many men abuse the BOTC (bounce-off the candlestick) method but they miss the sequence of number because Bitcoin grows exponentially. Meaning: we need to use uniplanar algebra such as logarithmic and Napierian (or Naperian) algorithms to calculate the continuously compounded return.
By doing this, you are actually creating a 3D image, universed, towards a pyramid scheme with the top moving into the 4th dimension. The wormhole, as we call it, co-insists by retracting the lowest alternative universe. Inside these future movements the platform lines up with the moving pattern.
What you really need to know is: "Does the trend make the chart, or the chart make the trend?"

Yes, but this method works only right now.
This did not work in the first 6 years of Bitcoin growing exponentially. Also this average did not work in the summer of 2016 and first half of 2017. Also the last few months was out of the moving average.
Some experts say to forget the bollinger band, Fibonacci retracement and moving average indicator. The simple moving average points are traditionally succesfull, but Bitcoin is a new dimension.
Have you ever tried the minimal-points ratio technique and failed? What about the extended indicators?
Many men abuse the BOTC (bounce-off the candlestick) method but they miss the sequence of number because Bitcoin grows exponentially. Meaning: we need to use uniplanar algebra such as logarithmic and Napierian (or Naperian) algorithms to calculate the continuously compounded return.
By doing this, you are actually creating a 3D image, universed, towards a pyramid scheme with the top moving into the 4th dimension. The wormhole, as we call it, co-insists by retracting the lowest alternative universe. Inside these future movements the platform lines up with the moving pattern.
What you really need to know is: "Does the trend make the chart, or the chart make the trend?"
So, let's all learn this, and let's all be millionaires because you can calculate it by new modern artificial mathematics! Use it to your advantage.

That is not entirely true.
For Muslims, clerics have a big impact. But also, the bitcoin-system has not been clarified well enough for the clerics. Some people are too quick in explaning this Bitcoin system.
However, if the government makes it illegal, then clerics will also follow, because Muslims need to obey the governments if it does not go against their religion. Muslim/Islam is a religion of hierarchy, not anarchy. Diplomacy and democracy has been accepted from the beginning of the religion (as long as it goes not against their religion). So, if the governments allow it, then it is allowed if it does not go against their religion.
Hopefully this clarifies some of it.

Don't try to chase a pump. If you see it make jumps like that, invest a tiny bit, and wait, then again, and wait... DCA
Also, why does it need to go to 80,000 ? Why can't it stay on 13,000 bucks for 10 years? If demand and supply stay the same... if they don't increase by fomo... There is no need to increase substantially.

Nothing will happen to Bitcoin itself.
1/ The market will respond by admitting the price was artificially pumped up, therefore correct itself.
2/ Or the market will accept this price because most are greedy dipheads wanting it to go exponentially up.
So basically, Bitcoin is a speculation coin. Market will speculate if tethers falsely pumped up the price or maybe the price is justified. Who knows.

The only real reason is people *wanting* it go up so they can sell for fiat. What if it stays stable? Why is that not considered succesfull?

Hey money-badger,
The only problem with tether is that it did not allow any audit yet.
People are greedy. There is a big chance that the owners did create fake tethers. Printed out of thin airless digital numbers. This way they can buy bitcoins, and sell these bitcoins anywhere else. Therefore making a profit.
Banks do print money, but it's all regulated. And they have audits on a regular basis. However they still do criminal shit.
So imagine a digital currency exchange with no audits. You trust them? Why? Because you want to believe in a fairytale?

That is not entirely true.
For Muslims, clerics have a big impact. But also, the bitcoin-system has not been clarified well enough for the clerics. Some people are too quick in explaning this Bitcoin system.
However, if the government makes it illegal, then clerics will also follow, because Muslims need to obey the governments if it does not go against their religion. Muslim/Islam is a religion of hierarchy, not anarchy. Diplomacy and democracy has been accepted from the beginning of the religion (as long as it does not go against their religion). 
So, if the governments allow it, then it is allowed if it does not go against their religion.
Hopefully this clarifies some of it.
May I ask which parts are you not agree upon?
Also you are well disinformed if you claim that financers and bankers are the ones advicing the scholars because the scholars advice *against* the banking system.
Being part of the government is also not a valid argument of not accepting the clerics' analysis.

I would advise you to keep away from those tricks. Unless it's a slice of your bitcoins (not all of them) - a part you can afford to lose. Because sooner or later making 5% and 10%, you'll lose by dropping 40% and we all know dropping 40% is bigger than increasing 40% which will make you panic, go into alts and drop another 40%
In the meanwhile Bitcoin went up by 10% and you'd make an even bigger loss and miss out on the train by buying back in higher.
And before you know it you'll be opening on Reddit a topic how stupid you were.

Andyse olnopolnopololos was told by Roger ver to buy 300 bucks in 2012 then he'd be a millionaire now. This was great inside information from Roger.
So aneasa went to his time machine and bought 300 bucks worth 8 bucks a piece and sent it to himself (37 bitcoins). This explains why he is not using a SegWit adress. After noticing on coinmarketcap that he could have bought in at a lower price in 2012 he stomped his own head, screamed 'genius!' went back to his time machine and bought in at 7 bucks a piece (42 Bitcoin).
Long story short, the permanent circles are from time traveling (space, time continuum ripples for every hoop he tried) not from bitcoin core Shilling because he does not use a segwit address.

When Bitcoin rises altcoin stays the same or dips, losing up to 100%. Then altcoins grows back if you water it enough and give it sunshine and time. Meaning you have doubled your Bitcoin in the same timespan.

Well to be exact, newspapers and banksters were calling it a ponzi. The big masses follow their masters blindfolded and that's what you see now.
You know what they call it right now? "the bigger fool's game" (also "greater fool theory"). This means you buy something and hope for a bigger fool to buy your asset.
This is a bit more complicated, because I have to argue; they are correct,... BUT this is how the economy works:
Millions and millions of iPhones are sold every year to bigger fools. Tens and tens of millions of commodities are sold to bigger fools.
If people were not foolish they would only buy stuff that really matter: no brand clothes, no visible jewelry, no big house, no fast(er) car, etc...

If you leave the coins on an exchange, then you need to trust the exchange. If you can withdraw them (to your own wallet, which means they are real), you can follow the coins on the blockchain (which records every transaction ever made). For example check your transaction ID (given by the exchange) on blockchain.info
The price itself is haggling all the way long. I sell at 1.01 someone else wants to sell quicker and sells at 1.00 then I go along selling at 0.99
On the other side someone wants to buy at 0.95 and another one wants to buy sooner at 0.96, then another one at 0.97
This makes the 'global' price. People are willing to buy/sell at these prices overbidding themselves.
You can always try to buy at a much lower price, you'll have to wait longer or forever. Or maybe catch a spike, but certainly not suitable for daytrading.
Actually, nothing is suitable for daytrading coins. Better stay far away from it.

However, they need to trust it's people. And people need to trust it's governments. Ironically that is extremely hard to accomplish.

It is as if there is a dorkbook which you need to learn to be the perfect pig:
-  Never use a normal/mainstream word as 'hold', be "specials" use hodl instead. Every-time.
- Now and then post 'to da moon' with crossed eyes. Maybe insert 'lambo' inside the titel. Because *hardy, harr* it's so funny and original.
- Post the uptime revenue everytime Bitcoin drops. E.g.: "Look at those noobs panicking because Bitcoin dropped to 8,000. Bitcoin is still up 60% from 3 months ago."
- Upvote the eco-chamber
- Repost meme's.
- Downvote the apostates who use "hold" instead of "hodl". Mark them as BCH shills or preferably bCash shill. Do not forget to snort and squeak while doing all of this!

Example given OmiseGo, Monero, QTum... They all offer different infrastructures, but they all look (indirectly) at bitcoins value.

Coin Y looks at coin X valued at 250 bucks.
Coin X looks at Bitcoin.
Bitcoin looks at gold's value.

You could extend your example by saying there's only 1 Bitcoin left right now. That means it's worth 300 billion. Nobody has that at this moment in this market.
This means it's devided.
At this moment
1 Bitcoin is 1000 millibits 1,000,000 (micro)bits 100,000,000 satoshis.
So if I own 1 Bitcoin right now worth 12,000 that means I own 4 satoshis if 1 only Bitcoin is worth 300,000,000,000 (devide by 100,000,000 Satoshi coins = 3000 bucks per satoshi).
The point I'm making is, it's devisable up to 100,000,000th of a coin. And if there is consensus we could equate 1 bitcoin to 100,000,000,000,000 microsatoshis

Dude, you don't need new money 'pouring' in. There's nothing be poured in. You sell, someone else buys. If less people sell, this goes up. More demand. Market decides.

It could easily go to 100,000 but also go back down...
Reason for why Bitcoin would not have a problem going up to 100,000 is because marketcap is not the same as total value. Only a specific amount is traded and has the value of 100,000. When you sell that specific amount then it drops down to another slice of amount:share etc...
In contrary to Fiat. Fiat is a known that there is (for example) 1,000,000 bills in circulation. And this does not affect the net worth.
The only reason that Bitcoin will be less volatile is when it steps into the field of buying/selling stuff. Which means you would not need to exchange it to fiat. Which means the government needs to be on the side of Bitcoin (regulating it). As long as it does not, then Bitcoin would be highly volatile and a store of value (keep exchanging it back to Fiat).

This means you re just quicker at the same protocol. So only miners, not nodes.
BCH has more blocks, therefore a longer chain. If they had the same protocol they would have whiped out BTC.
The white paper reads that the longest chain is the trusted chain.
So if you mine faster in a quarantained system starting from block 615,000 and you publish this chain when you hit block 635,000 and the online chain is at 634,999 then everything before this block will get a rollback and the system will take your chain as the real trusted chain. Meaning everything what happened on the online chain between 615,000 and 634,999 will get whiped out.
This will disrupt the entire system.
You can't steal anything, you will be double spending. Transactions on the online chain did not happen in the offline chain. When the offline chain goes online, all the transaction will get replaced by the offline chain; hence double spending.

Scared of responsibility.
Today I read an article about someone who lost 850,000 bucks in a pay check in Canada.
In Bitcoin you could have just sent it over digitally.
However, after a few months the bank decided to extraordinary make another payment check of 850,000 bucks. So the people were happy.
If this happens with bitcoins (lost or hacked), nobody will help you.
Banks give a security promise. They rollback money. They take the responsibility to secure your money. If the bank collapses, governments will jump in. And most importantly, the masses love this.

@_date: 2017-12-03 16:48:03
I think you guys have too much imagination.
The simplest 'worst case scenario' would be governments implying a ban on selling, buying, trading, working with bitcoins.
Some people would say this would not affect the little user, but the big exchanges will close down.
That is correct, but the little user (most of them) will also back off because of being afraid to be sued over something like Bitcoin. Also the eco-system will have to embrace for an impact: blockstream, wallets, professional mining hardware, GitHub,... will all need to work with the government's issued decrees. Websites etc...
Secondly, the big masses will not be stepping in and finally point towards the 'reckless' Bitcoin users: 'told you so'.
And thirdly, because of it's increased destabilization people will move out of Bitcoin.
Notice that this will not kill Bitcoin, but it will definitely hurt it's image and make it go underground like an ugly rat. In numbers? Let's say 2 - 50 bucks.
On the other hand, if it really wa'ts to kill Bitcoin they would just buy specialized hardware and attack the network. They have billions at stake, they could increase the hashrate to *1,000,000,000 and then drop the mic.

@_date: 2017-12-24 09:25:45
Yeah, not sure what this is all about...
Also, market cap is hugely misunderstood.
Not ALL bitcoins are worth 10,000 bucks, just a limited 'slice' of the available bitcoins. Also, there are 4 millions coins lost.
Secondly: ALL coins rise in value as soon as Bitcoin rises.
Ex.: Total value is 1 billion.
Shitcoin X was worth 1 bucks with a total value of 1 million.
Bitcoin rises 10x shitcoin X parasites off of bitcoins' worth and also multiplies by 10 (keeping it on the same Bitcoin value).
Result: worth 10 million.
Total market cap 10,010,000,000.
Conclusion: market cap is shit. You should use it as a comparison and/or ratio, NOT and NEVER as a value.

They could make another fork just like s2x and screw over people with their own hashrate. Clog up the mempool. Classic attacks from our evil twin bcash. Remember, they have billions and billions dollars, trillions.
And last, but not least, they could lobby and just put a ban Bitcoin and make it go underground (again). This means no Amazon, no Microsoft, no shops accepting Bitcoin... Only hardcore will stay truthfull to bitcoin. Price will drop.

@_date: 2017-12-04 10:31:33
If buffet has 1 billion cash.
And the market cap of Bitcoin is 2 billion, in no way Bitcoin is bigger than buffet.
Buffet has 1 billion, the value of his money does not decrease if he uses 1 dollarbill, 1 million or all 1 billion bills.
Bitcoin's market cap is 2 billion. If you sell 1 million bitcoins, the market cap will drastically go down. You will end up on a much lower 'marketcap' than 2 billion.
Marketcap = bitcoins value at this very moment times coins... which is ridiculous because a) approx 4 million coins are lost b) you can't sell all the bitcoins at this price: price will be zero.
Therefore 1 billion cash &gt; 2 billion market cap
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:36:36
You know what's ridiculous. People worshipping Bitcoin and calculating bitcoins value at gold's value and then these same people degrading gold.
Then there are Altcoin A who look at Bitcoin and tell their followers. If Bitcoin can reach this price, we can too...
And then there is altcoin B looking at altcoin A telling their worshippers: if altcoin A can have this value, then sure we too!
So altcoin b looks at altcoin a. Altcoin a looks at Bitcoin. And Bitcoin loooks at gold.
Pathetic imo...

When it dipped before we even bothered about Christmas the reason was 'correction' when it dipped further: 'healthy correction'. When it dipped at Christmas people were cashing out. When Christmas is over and it dips people took out to pay for stuff.
These were some of the topics:
"Bitcoin drops to 18,000 we're still up 40% 1 week ago".
"Bitcoin drops to 15,500, now we're at the same level of begin of this month (10 days ago)."
"Look at these noobs panicking. Bitcoin drops to 14,000, we're still up 50% from a month ago."
"Bitcoin drops to sub 10,000. Noobs chill out, we're still up 50% from 6 weeks ago."
"Bitcoin drops to 5,000. Funny. Everyone panicking but Bitcoin is still up 400% from January".
Disgusting, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:33:43
Yes, it's too late. The price could be tomorrow sub 1,000 so I would wait, but if you're buying (preferably at 760 bucks) then be careful because the bubble might burst and splash in your face!
So don't buy right now because it might rise tomorrow. Then you're missing this opportunity. The dip is always a good moment, but you should be more prepared if we hit an all time high, because 10% dipping is normal. It's not a real dip.
A dip is when it goes higher than 80% in 24 hours without manipulation. So it's very hard to buy at an ATH, because you don't know how to dollar cost average this coin or whatever they call it. You can't even touch it! 
Governments oppose the coins and Charlie Lee just donated some of his LiteCoins. But that's not the case, bitcoin is the original. It's too big too fail. But remember, there is no insurance. Only futures. So wait for it to rise and then buy! When we get the dip, then penetrate it without using an altcoin. Because it just dipped to 3,900 but it's allready above 4,000 bucks.
Is it safe? Hell yeah. But nobody can guarantee you the gold.

Thanks for your effort.
I don't know Turkish, so the second one is void.
The last link was an advice. Anyone could advice you to not invest in Bitcoin. It was not agressive. I respect his advice. Do you think it was agressive?
The first video was in my opinion a miscomprehension. He said some things which are not correct, such as
1/ it's not fysical, you don't receive a certificate. You could definitely say the seed is a certificate. It's fysical (cold storage).
2/ it's for money laundering. It used to be, but now most people are not using it for 'bad things'.
3/ it's not simultaneously. Yes it could be, if it is on an exchange. Or if you trade in person (sell the seed), which people do.
4/ it's a Ponzi. You could get out instantly, that's not a characteristic of a ponzi scheme.
5/ not knowing the inventor. We do know him, it's that Australian dude (haha, but the point is, it does not matter). The code is open and there are no secrets. No hidden traps. You can't tamper with it.
6/ the price went up significantly. Yes, we know. Apple's stock also went up. Google, Amazon. Etc... You need to be on your guard. But this is a difference of opinion: a) You could advice agressive not to invest (scare of the weakhanded, save them from buying high, sell low) or b) advice non agressively (making the weakhanded getting mad at you because you did not warn them)
So basically it's a lot of miscomprehension. Although I found it an agressive discouragement.
I find to read different angles interesting so you won't be blinded by the moon topics.

Thank you for correcting me.
I just read the whitepaper again and indeed it is written that BTC has 85% more work than BCH.
I find it weird that both chains are written in the whitepaper. Don't you agree?
Hello. Why are both chains mentioned in the whitepaper or did you mean something else?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:19:03
What do you mean? And why am I getting downvoted?

What do you mean keep the money in crypto? He sold his BTC, he now has USD. Either leave it on the exchange or withdraw.
If he buys again, then he's a daytrader. Either way, the USD is back at the seller.
Sooner or later he will fail daytrading and open a topic how he should have hold, etc... but that's another story.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:53:27
Hey, what's the normal price of BTC without the people who fomo?
Is the fomo also present at BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:25:33
Yup, it will hurt Bitcoin. Maybe it'll drop to 20 bucks and go back underground. Not killing it, but certainly making it weak and barely usable.

Allright, I will keep the 'context' loud and clear - since you are trying to mix up different modern scholarly opinions to prove an old mechanism.
1/ muslims believe Jesus will return. what school will Jesus follow?
2/ what school did Muhammad follow?
3/ what school did his companions and his fellow group follow?
4/ what school did the 'founders' of the schools follow?
5/ which schools are mentioned in the quran?
6/ why is it 'limited' to 4 - I means 5 - schools?
Ask yourself these questions. No context needed this time.
Then we will clearly see what 'scholarly consensus' is. How it's used to manipulate and we will see who is holding the axe trying to scare people into following a madhab.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:28:20

Hey, Roger Ver bitshamed Andreas by saying if only he bought just 300 bucks in 2012 he would be a millionaire now.

But we're talking about the guy selling to you, he has the USD now. What is he going to do with it? Leave it on the exchange, bringing risks... Or withdraw back to his bank.

No. People are always, and always looking for patterns. Trying to time the market. And then afterwards opening topics how they failed and should've just hold instead of trading.

It's coordinated, which means they probably buy up their own coins in a 9:10 ratio. A lot of fomo's are into the game too losing a 1:1 ratio.
So all in all, they could be going on for a few days to be honest.

Hey, it's not "mines", it's just the orderbook of gdax. It literally tells us when there's a sell order of approx 100,000 bucks (12-14 bitcoins) then the price will drop 20 bucks.
On condition that there are no buyers for a higher price after this sell order (takers must be the same or lower than the new price). Then another sell order will bring it down 19.5-20 bucks.
Then another 19.5-20 bucks.
Do you know gdax, sir?

Dollar cost average: try to buy in small steps so you won't buy the ATH.

@_date: 2017-11-11 21:39:05
Yeah, but I was replying to 'even if you want to, you can't sell'. I was just saying - yes, you can. People leave their coins on the exchange if they trade.
The guy wrote this, selling his BTC at 5.10, that's 2 cents more than his initial buying. Which is pretty weird to be honest, because Bitcoin is also going up and down. So he probably sold for less bitcoins than he bought the vtc's (still a loss).
Anyways, I was just saying: he sold at just 2 cents above his level. This means he had his vtc's on the exchange, you can't sell this quick: seeing the price go 2 cents up, transferring vtc's to your exchange. Waiting. Verifying... You would panic.
That's why I said 'yes, you can'.
Nothing personal, but I'm getting sick to explain every shitposts I make on Reddit. Can't people think by themselves?

Bitcoin evolves by partially taking over ideas from smaller coins.
This is exactly what could happen if governments want to step in. They can create a new decentralized, regulated, transparent coin and copy all the features that Bitcoin has making bitcoin drop in value.
Their coin will survive.
Imagine s2x in the November fork, but this time governments will stand behind them taking over the biggest exchanges and create their own mining utilities + all the rest, naming, shaming, selling, buying. They will use creative campaign and help out industries using this new coin. The new coin has born.
What stops them doing this? Please don't be naive...
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:16:09

So in this story you are the little growling pussy and the boss is the bank.
And anyways, you could just transfer YOUR money in parts. Instead of 1000 euro deploy 250€ multiple times. Still cheaper and less middlemen trying to profit from YOUR investment.
On another note: If it's insignificant please leave your money in bitcoins and support the Bitcoin revolution.

Minor negative impact? Boy, you're up for a surprise. If you think that the people buying Bitcoin now (surging the price from a dollar to 7000) are stronghanded you're so wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:12:10
Whenever banking systems embrace bitcoin, they will start 'printing' fake bitcoins. Just like they are printing tethers right now.
Who will stop them when you can borrow 1000 fake bitcoins, and you could spend them in a list of shops accepting (real and fake) bitcoins?
Why would shops accept fake bitcoins? Because the bank is making a promise to these shops. When the poor bastards can not pay these stuff they won't buy them. Now they are buying (with money which they don't have).
They have your identity so you can't steal these fake bitcoins. And you have to pay these fake bitcoins back to the bank at an interest just as the days we know them right now.
The fake bitcoins will get settled between the bank and the store and will never (could never) hit the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:25:58
Hi, I understand that you are trying to be smart. But you were comparing Bitcoin with other scenario's that are based on trust. Bitcoin is a trust less system.
Stealing is not ok. We get it. But the point is not that you need to trust eachother to make it work. Therefore those examples are invalid.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:12:24
There are thousands of ICO's and coins. There are coins that are NOT open sourced, NOT backed up and without any future (only a whitepaper) having succes...
If the government feels threatened and they understand that this is the future. Why would they not step in? You think they will hand it over to you on a silver plate?
You saying 'that would not going to happen' is the same as someone else saying 'bitcoin would never succeed'.
Why are you so closed minded?
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:31:09
You're basically looking to mine a cheap coin and hoping it will rise. So are you up for losing now and maybe win in the future?

@_date: 2017-11-16 21:28:38
Yeah. Looks like a solid buy in whenever they print some more.
Unfortunately, us, little guys who notice this, we can't even do anything about it. They sicken the market, and the community is addicted to tethers. It's an easy way out, as long as everybody shuts their mouth...

No need to "standardize", just show them both. Exchanges should also show both
1 BTC = 6500 bucks
1 mBTC = 6,5 bucks

It's in the decimals.
Imagine you want to buy at 100,00 bucks, someone else also wants to buy at 100,00 bucks but he's a little less patient than you so he pays 100,01 bucks because he does not care about that one penny.
And now there is also a bot competing putting another price of 100,02 bucks.
And imagine now millions of people in the market and every million second someone arbitrates and overbids another buyer.

I'm just kidding.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:21:11
It's not ridiculous. Ridiculous is when people tell us that Bitcoin has a marketcap of 8,200 x 17,000,000 coins which means EVERY coin is 8,200 worth while it's not.
This is exactly what gdax tells us: When you sell 100,000 bucks worth of Bitcoin in a steady market the price will roughly go 20 bucks down. That's why Bitcoin rises and dips so quickly in a one way market.
So on condition that it needs to go one way untill it hits the bottom, which realistically never will.

Since most of reddit do not believe in any religiousness (that basically mentions what's good or bad in the religion). This means turning towards the law and internal agreements (between politicians and countries, company's).
If nothing is said in those two, then it is an ethical question. Some will do it, some won't because of rationality (e.g.: Panama papers).
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:02:46

@_date: 2017-11-11 13:47:55
How is it even profitable if no one wants to buy? The market decides: for every sell there is a buy. So someone out there is thinking he's making a good deal. Good for them.

@_date: 2017-11-12 16:34:02
Yeah, you'd possible catch a peak, but not on full throttle.
You'd also not fully buy the dip, but you'd be an 'average' buyer. Hence dollar cost average. 
Try to time it a little bit, and you'll likely have a better average (or a worse), but you'll never have the full impact.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:23:54
Could be.
Not only Wallstreet. But the idea has been longer on this forum.
Government(s) buys Bitcoin (prints Fiat, who cares). They eventually have so many bitcoins that they could control the market:
- destabilize the market
- or they will get filthy rich
It's a win win (for them).

You're delusional.
Just pick a random day in the past and try your best predicting top and bottom. You will fail.

I know what you said. You're over-exaggerating... That's why I said some people worship Bitcoin, and their prophet Satoshi.
When in 20 years a huge part (exchanges, community, Bitcoin developers, miners, etc...) agree on a hard fork, then it will be a matter of opinion.
We will all say the new chain is Bitcoin/btc.
To make it more clear to you:
It has been propagated that Bitcoin has left it's core idea: time-out (zero-conf) and SegWit. A "real" hardcore bitcoiner would never accept those two changes and will reject them (which is very stupid and short sighted).
Hence: a matter of opinion!

@_date: 2017-11-29 21:19:51
Why do you think it will only move 1% if it hits 1,000,000 ?
Do you think it will hit more % if the volume got higher?
What do you think will happen if we denominate 1,000,000 per bitcoin to 1,000 per milliBitcoin (and Volume in increases by x1000 ), will it also move by 1 % ? Psychologically more realistically?

Yeah, didn't you got an email from gdax then?
"If the Bitcoin2x blockchain becomes the chain with the most accumulated difficulty, and the chains are in a stable state, we will consider renaming it to Bitcoin and send an additional communication at that time. We will consider other factors such as market cap, community support, etc to determine stability. We will start evaluating this 2 weeks after the fork."
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:32:05

@_date: 2017-11-07 20:53:37
That's a good thought, however it's hardcoded. So it's a win-win: there's ultimate transparency and governments can own 5 or 10 millions of bitcoins, it doesn't matter. It's decentralized and transparent.
If it gets centralized, then it's our own fault making the step towards centralization (Bitcoin cash or s2x). On the other side, there are multiple other coins available.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:06:08
The governments could easily work together and create a copy of bitcoin and start from scratch, giving everyone premined coins equivalent to their wealth - with the exact same possibilities like we have now with bitcoin.
Therefore the new coin would be more trustworthy for the big masses. And people getting into the new coin would not have a disadvantage they are having now.
Also the governments could own a significant amount of the coins (premined).
What would be the problem if they did this? We will lose, but why should we worship Bitcoin?
Keep in mind, decentralized, mining capabilities, transparency, limited coins... Everything could be the same. Basically they will give the code out of their hands.
The majority could ignore Bitcoin, but they could also invent a new coin. They are the majority so they could fix this mistake you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:03:59

Dear GDAX Customer:
We wanted to give customers an update on two upcoming Bitcoin forks – Bitcoin Segwit2x and Bitcoin Gold. You can read more about what a digital currency fork is here and see our prior update here.
We operate by the principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events. This is essential in our mission to make GDAX the most trusted and liquid digital asset exchange.
Bitcoin Segwit2x
The Bitcoin Segwit2x fork is projected to take place on November 16th and will temporarily result in two bitcoin blockchains for some period of time. GDAX will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X).
All GDAX customers will be able to trade both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin2x (B2X) within 4 hours after the fork.
Any customer with a Bitcoin (BTC) balance on GDAX at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the Bitcoin2X (B2X).  No action is required – we will automatically credit your account.
For more information about Bitcoin2x please see our FAQ page and our blog post for a detailed timeline of events.
Bitcoin Gold
The Bitcoin Gold fork occurred on October 23rd. Information about this fork has been limited and there are concerns about its security and stability. As a result, we do not believe it is safe to allow support for Bitcoin Gold at this time. If the blockchain proves to be secure and valuable, GDAX may choose to support it.
You can read more about Bitcoin Gold at our FAQ page. 
Over the coming weeks, we will keep you updated on this event through our blog, status page and twitter.

Hey, man. Why don't you wait untill it drops to tree fitty or maybe 250 dollars? Good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:45:23
Nailed it!
Should've titled it 'future dips and ATH unveiled'. Bitcoin UNVEILED! Or some equivalent.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:31:30
Don't let the door hit you on your way out.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:00:04
Yeah, but people always think they are smart and figured it out. They found the 'paterns'. How much I want to see their stupid faces every time when then make a chart with 'paterns'.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:23:08
Weakhanded, poor milennials. Welcome.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:20:57
lol, they could just pay by bank card?
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:09:16
So, you're saying your prophet was wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:38:06
Yeah, apparently the resto is not for the masses at this moment. Blinded, brain disabled visa following masses.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:08:00
Having your coins on a trading platform means they own the keys. When they send you the coins after the fork, nobody can tell you those coins where exactly the coins that you had before the split. Maybe they will send you 'new' coins or even older coins.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:59:17
Yeah, you can get ripped off. Don't leave your coins on any online wallet. But it can't be hacked.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:55:08
Sorry for tricking out on you, but yeah people do not know for sure. You'll get answers but overall people will tell you just stories.
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:19:17
It doesn't matter globally. If I sell my bitcoins to some people for 15,000 bucks. Who cares?
Right, nobody. Except locally.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:32:17
Yeah, but when you read the message it says 'even if you want to'. This means nobody can.
I'm just saying, yes you can.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:52:15
Well written. And we haven't brought up the bitcoin-altcoin manipulation.
They could easily buy altcoins before the announcement, and set up triggers at Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:43:22
Apple and Nike are fully compliant. Why do you think they are not guilty? Because they just used a perfectly legal (but unethical) loophole (makes me think of bcash ASIC).
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:14:28
Why would this be a problem?
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:59:03
The sole principle of existence and the future is this.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:11:58
If you keep using bitcoins, nothing will happen. You're in charge.
If you keep your own keys, then you're in no danger.
If you keep your coins on an exchange then they have access to the coins. They have access to the forked coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:06:54
So you're saying your prophet was wrong in the first place?
Also; should I show you my 5 years reddit account? Would that make you drool all over your Logitech keyboard?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:31:27
This is getting out of hand. Disgusting fanbois.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:14:53
Gossip tabloid... So this is where we at now...
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:01:29
They were savages, trying to win from eachother.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:12:05
The sites says, "not yet implemented".
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:12:00
Hahaha, love to see people fail and fall down in the dust. Acting all pathetic and coming back with a story how they lost BTC's... Screw them all. Should've holded instead of gambling trying to be millionaire overnight. You deserve this.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:27:18
Yeah. Still people complain just by looking at the last month...
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:47:37
Nailed it!
People are quitting too soon... They have watched too many Hollywood movies I think? It takes years to appreciate eachother's kindness. Small actions. Little words.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:51:42
Yeah, but people don't want to hear that. You even get downvoted for telling the truth.
People just bring up charts whenever they notice they are correct. This chart has been posted multiple times. This is the most successful post.
People just love looking for patterns. Hey, look at me. I unraveled the mystery of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:42:29
This one is coinbase:
We wanted to give you an update on two upcoming Bitcoin forks—Bitcoin Segwit2x and Bitcoin Gold. You can read more about what a digital currency fork is here and see our prior update here. 
We operate by the principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events. This is essential in our mission to make Coinbase the most trusted, safe, and easy-to-use digital currency exchange. 
Bitcoin Segwit2x 
The Bitcoin Segwit2x fork is projected to take place on November 16th and will result in two bitcoin blockchains. Following the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x. 
Any customer with a Bitcoin balance on Coinbase at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the Bitcoin2x asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain. No action is required—we will automatically credit your account. So, if you have 5 Bitcoin stored on Coinbase before the fork; you will have 5 Bitcoin and 5 Bitcoin2x following the event. 
For more information about Bitcoin2x please see our FAQ page and our blog post for a detailed timeline of events. 
Bitcoin Gold
The Bitcoin Gold fork occurred on October 23rd. Information about this fork has been limited and there are concerns about its security and stability. As a result, we do not believe it is safe to allow support for Bitcoin Gold at this time. If the blockchain proves to be secure and valuable, Coinbase may choose to support it. 
For more information about Bitcoin Gold please see our FAQ page. 
Over the coming weeks, we will keep you updated on this event through our blog, status page and twitter.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:16:30
Nailed it!
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:16:26
They mean to keep the money on the bank (no bankrun) if you don't need it. Good idea from government perspective.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:03:04
Yeah... In reality these dipheads sell at 7,000 and it goes up to 7,600. Then they start fud posts and regret selling at 7,000.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:02:27
What are you trying to say? If you got your keys and you transfer your bitcoins they could vanish?
So if I make a new fork I could mess with all of you? Of course not... Use your brains for a change, man.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:02:34
Just wait a lil bit more.
When we hit 10,000 it will possibly drop to 8,500 so be prepared to buy the dip!
You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:25:42
It's the realest Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:17:37
Get ready for a dive.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:15:39
What do you mean? I'm just stating a fact that coinbase and other exchanges where ready and steady to change s2x to Bitcoin/BTC (if market, community, bitcoin core, hash, ...  agree).
We would all move on (IF we all agree on this), just a small hardcore part would worship Satoshi, and the bitcoin religion as if life depends on it. That's their fault.
It's all relative.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:50:00
Yeah... Greedy bastards trying to make us look dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:42:46
You're destroying Bitcoin with your all time hate on Bitcoin cash. People don't even know Bitcoin cash , nor Roger ver. But with all these hate topics you just cut your own hands. If this is the community you want to be, good luck, cause you need it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:01:25
Nailed it!
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:33:09
Yeah, good attitude.
Some are buying right now, hoping it will rise.
Some are waiting to buy the very lowest dip possible.
Some are hoping to buy sub 1,000 more specifically 690 dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:21:05
I hope you're joking. This could never be his wife. Why would you treat your wife like this?
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:34:09
They will create their own chain.
Miners will stick to their game.
Thus making coinbase choose the main.
Making Bitcoin going vain.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:01:19
It's free money. You could also make your own fork and call it something-something and tell the market it's worth 1/10th of the real bitcoin.
Easy money.
In my opinion worser than real life printing Fiat. Everyone can fork. Not everyone can print...
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:21:42
Wait for Cyber Monday.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:36:58
He probably means owning 21 butcoins. Because if you own 21 bitcoins, only 1 million people can own 21 bitcoins. Hence 1 million club.
Unless he's a dreamer and he hopes 1 Bitcoin will reach a million dollar. Then I would laugh at him.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:19:07
Coinbase could easily sell s2x as if it's Bitcoin.
There goes your moon...
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:14:25
This is pure nonsense. Liquidity can change in milliseconds.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:11:56
Yeah, it will drop. Just wait when it will hit 10,000 and then buy the dip at 8,700.
You're welcome bro!
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:22:22
I think he has all the right to repeat nonsense from a journalist, just like you repeat a drunk guy from a few years ago?
What's the difference?
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:46:53
Real shitposts are the ones that don't know it's a shitposts... I'm looking at you superfanboy...
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:29:41
You're getting downvoted because you said 'wallah'. Just a heads up... Closed community is closed.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:54:42
What do you mean by the price of s2x is reduced from BTC? You are wrong on so many levels. No one decides to reduce the price of Bitcoin when a fork happens.
The price is 7,000 . Fork happens. The price is still 7,000... The only price-movement may happen due to buying/selling demand increases/decreases. The market decides (weak hands or strong bots).
I think you most definitely are not capable of trading in BTC. Just buy BTC and hold the coin. This would reduce these kind of topics and increase your investment.
Your sleep at night would also be better.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:17:09
Wait a month and then look back at your topic. Nobody knows, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:45:28
That is correct. You got the winners, the losers trying to be winners and the holders spectating the whole match for free.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:22:10
If 10 bucks is a serious amount for you, then yeah, you could make another 10 or 20 bucks.
If you're a millionaire and you invest 50,000 then making it 100,000 is not a significant amount.
In other words: it's all relative.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:04:56
Reported as duplicate, I was looking for the multi-triple-giga-duplicate plagiarism report button but have not found it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:26:09
Impossible to hack...
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:11:51
No, shit. Really?
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:33:55
In india, it dropped down to 7500 - in a closed, quarantained country.
In my house a bitcoin costs 23,000,000 and it dropped down to 21,000,000.
Globally - it dropped down to 6500.
What's your point?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:01:51
You will only burn yourself when greed has taken over your heart and brains.
Meaning: if you keep using Bitcoin, nothing will happen. If you try to sell s2x (out of greed) then you might sell your Bitcoins along with it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:47:17
Then we get those shitposts telling us not to trade and how they lost and wished to do this and that. Same ol', same ol'.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:25:43
Yeah, but it could also 'climb' down 20% really quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:21:33
Then you are one of the million crypto experts on reddit. Welcome fortune teller.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:32:02
Please elaborate.
What's wrong with above scenario?
Government premines. Registers equivalent wealth to the coins per person. Promises certain value to back it up and then releases the code to run and mine.
This is a dream for latecomers and sceptics.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:37:34
Yeah it's possible. Some people are waiting to drop sub 1000, more specifically 690 dollars.
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:45:04
But that's not what they plan.
Didn't you hear?
First sell,... then buy. Then sell, sell, sell man!
It's gone. It's all gone. The ATH...
The whole chain is in a loop now. Bye, bye, bye!
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:49:18
Anyone who sells their crypto for tether carries this risk. But also Bitcoin carries this risk: Company prints tethers. Company buys Bitcoin with zero value tethers. Company sells Bitcoin.
We're all gonna get screwed over if tether fails.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:36
Yeah, I agree. It's a matter of opinion. Just like coinbase and other exchanges were ready to change the name of s2x to BTC/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:41:12
First of all, not sure why your're talking about Apple?
You could easily change the title, what if a government buys up bitcoins.
Well yeah, that would be probably be the end of bitcoins for the reason you already mentioned:
1) They could easily manipulate the market
2) scare off future and current investors
The governments could print fiat and buy more bitcoins so that would be no problem. The third issue is if they can not manipulate and scare off people that would make these governments probably the most valuable governments ever existed (because if Bitcoin does not crash it means it will rise).
So it's a win win situation of them: either they win by destroying Bitcoin. Or win by making themselves filthy rich.
Forget Apple, most unrealistic scenario ever...
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:20:14
Yeah, they *should* be automatically collected in one huge garbage topic replying to eachothers stupidness.
ALL -dips- topics send to huge garbage diptopic.
ALL -buy- send to huge garbage should,i,buy,topic
Should I sell.
It's crashing.
It's rising.
I'm really getting disgusted...
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:30:23
The marketcap is not what you think it is.
If you want a good estimation to see what Bitcoin is worth at this very moment. Take 8,200 and take off 20 bucks every 100,000 bucks (of bitcoin) you sell. Because when someone sells at this moment 100,000 bucks of bitcoins it goes down 20 bucks (if there are complementary buyers).
Do that untill you come down to zero.
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:32:13
Not at a chance. Imagine it replaced a currency in some kind of country. And then segwit2x comes along, and shitcoin cash is trying to steal the show claiming both chains will die and it will be the real bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:55:40
How is this even possible? We already hit 7500 before, we even hit 7800,... so why did he not show up then?
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:43:37
This is going to be a killer.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:21:56
I don't know how old that guy is... Majority? Never knew reddit were 50 year olds...
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:08:18
The exchange deposits and withdraw daily. They can have priority if they own miners?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:22:45
Don't be greedy and nothing will go wrong. Stick with Bitcoin and you'll be fine. Try to sell s2x and you might get burned.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:44:14
These tether thing is gonna be a killer for the whole cryptocurrency industry.
Just print as much as you want, buy bitcoins, sell for Fiat. Profit.
And the community is just watching and claiming they decide what's good or wrong... What a joke. Reminds me of voting and thinking you can make a difference... The big players do not need you small cockroaches.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:48:19
You don't need to know that to buy btc. If that was the case, then bitcoin would still be around 200 bucks.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:15:33
I pre ordered my coins for just 2 cigarettes. Never thought it would be worth more than on Ali express. Good deal!
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:29:26
Good one. They deserve to be enslaved. Alternative money has been around for ages. Google liberty dollar, or the time-dollars. Ain't nobody going to fall for this internet money.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:59:03
You must be fun at parties .
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:53:24
Because bitcoin is his life. His everything. His love.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:32:00
Except this is not 2013? If only it was that easy. It's a high risk collective. Sometimes bitcoin is most comparable with art (like right now when people are bagholding). People decide the price.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:38:06
I think openingpost is a retard, a lil kid or just really dumb... 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:14:22
Definitely just decoration. An ugly decoration.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:19:48
They can't tell you what it is? It generates 30 meme's per day, focuses on price and you get frozen unused bitcoins that you may not use ("hodl")? Right?
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:44:06
Text should be clearly shorter!
Something like
Bitcoin is under 4K!
Time to buy!
You keep saying that!
Smart money is moving in right now!
You keep saying that too!
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:37
Haha, yeah.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:19:06
Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:16:26
There's nothing to be injected. You buy, someone else sells.
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:44:31
Really? Because this time it's clearly different from what happened back then.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:27:54
A 100? Maybe 500
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:45:48
We can check the volumes at coinmarketcap? We take the biggest exchanges and add up the bitcoins no?
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:00:45
If you told me this before I would've sold... Why didn't you?
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:13:11
Hi, I'm talking about an altcoin backed up by the government. I'm not talking about a coin selling in Ghuan zou.
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:49:01
I think the most ridiculous part about Bitcoin or any other coin is the creation of a new currency on the blockchain.
All the people before the hardfork instantly doubled their coins.
1 coin was 3000 bucks, the other coin was 500 bucks.
This is insane. You can't explain this fenomenon to the broad public. 'We' complain about money printing out of air... Imagine this... How could you even explain or justify this to the broad public. We're gonna get roasted...
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:41:31
Yeah, looks like the 4000 seems too weak to hold. Not enough buyers.
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:41:46
Should I show you my previous, precious account so you will treat me like the king I am to you?
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:38:46
I couldn't find a newer one. Imagine chinese own 30 % let's say they gonna sell 15% which means a drop by 3000 bucks * 3 million coins = 9.000.000.000
Roughly 10 billion dollars of Bitcoin.
Someone needs to pay this 10 to back to get back to 3000 bucks...
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:02:48
This is some effed up psychological horse shit. I'm surprised this reverse engineering is not illegal.
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:37:18
What I understood is the wallet will ask you to choose between the coins.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:21:16
Fasten your seatbelts gentlemen.
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:03:43
I like your reasoning.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:00:47
Why does it need to go up? Why can't it stay 10 years on this price? What is your analysis?
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:37:12
Yeah, for the time being we'll have to survive these topics... And by Wednesday we'll get 'why Bitcoin down?' (+/- 83 topics)...
When will bitcoin go back up? (+/- 72 topics)
For now we need to get +/- 32 topics about Bitcoin rising and some new graphs showing us it will go up, and go down. Bull, bear market. Read my predictions. Watch my analysis. Zoom out.
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:17:37
Lol - blow off phase is lower than (smart money) stealth phase? Can you show us what happens after that?
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:28:33
Big whales did not make enough profit. Big whales stuck at 4000. Now need to go back down. So whales can buy back up and ride the wave. Big whales no like slow ride.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:09:43
Countries could dismantle exchanges. Or ban shops to offer the option. But they would never go after small individuals. Unless you're propagating openly.
P2P is not a danger to the government, nor is it possible to shut P2P down.
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:19:20
It's simple. Well, it should be simple. If you buy with your bitcoin-card stuff... then there should be a setting to buy the exact same amount of Bitcoin from an exchange (from your choice). It will be a little more expensive (market price 0.25%) but at least you are:
1/ contributing to the community, which means:
A/ buying bitcoins when you spend them: demand increases
B/ merchants who accept Bitcoins will finally have someone who paid with bitcoin: More people will get in touch with bitcoin if more people buy with bitcoins.
2/ your pizza will cost you approx the same, so you won't have the mentality "my pizza cost me 3.7 million dollar".
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:00:24

This is nonsense...
She could never know about the current rumours and decisions in China. She could never know about the current difference between the exchanges in China (+/- 3000) and the West (+/- 4000). She could never know about the media hyping up Bitcoin so the broader public will step in. She could never know about the hard fork that took place which did influence the market. She could never know the new news and rumours that will come.
A prediction is based upon things you know now and in the past.

Write a complaint at report y at the police internet department. Do the same at were they are placed. Link the report in their Twitter. Print it out and send it to their office. Let them sign it off, receiving the lettre. Give them 4 weeks to fulfill your demands. Call a lawyer and ask his rates. Go to a lawyer.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:16:25
Hey man, the blow off phase is lower than institutional investers. They would never let the price go down below theirs.
Graphic proven false.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:30:31
Yeah, correct observation.
Also broke through 7000 because of s2x....
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:00:39
Next: "When do you think the price will go up?"
Just after the break!
Now: "Did we hit the bottom yet?"
But first: "Should I buy now?"
Don't miss our midnight show "Should I sell?" brought to you by one of the massive experts on Reddit.

Dude, those guys are professional traders. They do stuff to Bitcoin which is illegal if it was regulated. They know all the tricks and they whish their own market was just as bitcoin. They know what they do. They have their dirty methods and secrets.

Sorry. I apologize. I apologize!
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:38:06
Yes, right now: 4 bucks for 0.001 Bitcoin is indeed too expensive for most people. If it wasn't too espensive, then the demand would be huge. Not sure why you don't understand this? Simple economics.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:28:53
Yes, experts say it's highly inflated by illegal techniques.
However even if it wasn't inflated when demand and supply stay the same or shift just a little bit then price drops. So don't tell too soon and too loud 'weak hands' because it could be just that demand is decreasing or demand is staying the same. Then price can easily go down.

@_date: 2017-09-23 04:41:29
Could you please tell me what 'could' happen if they bought a lot of bitcoins?
It looks for me inevitable that:
1/ They will control the market (destabilize, push it, drop it...)
2/ They will get super rich (controlling the market, destabilize,...)
3/ They will destroy bitcoin (they lose billions, they won)
Why would this not happen? They 'could' hold  the bitcoins for ages. They have billions to print. And they are not allone.
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:21:16
They won't shut down block chain, but they could shut down or limit Bitcoin to a minimal. Just like pirate Bay. In the start it was all tough talk "they wont shut down torrent" blabla, but at the new they all got it very difficult to operate.

Yeah, and the 6 Bitcoins are probably 0.6 BCC of the adult.
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:59:04
Yeah hopefully it goes down to 3000 so we can buy some. And when we need more btc we gonna ask the same question over and over again and hope it will go back to 3000. When we need to sell we hope it will hit a million... So what do we want? Go back to 3000? Hope for it. Ask for it? Or hit a million bucks?
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:17:06
This is not the real sale. This is like Walmart increasing their prices from 100 to 125 the day before the sale... and then writing "SALE - 20%" and then you buy at 100...

No, I think the real expression of why they are in charge is... I think they are in charge because we don't deserve better leaders.
If I see how much hatred, greed, frauds, etc... is present in our communities (real life) and in the world wide web... then I do believe we deserve these kind of leaders. Change yourself first before you change the leadership.

@_date: 2017-09-09 10:41:00
Imo, it won't work the moment as we know it now.
Do consider what the governments have to lose? Control, fees, etc... of the people's wealth. There are so many taxes each government implements. They will lose all of this.
Therefore, IMO I believe the governments will implement Bitcoin or some sort of cryptocurrency as a part to control and establish the current fiat's net worth. The most important thing is THEY wil control it. It will probably be super transparent and regulated, limited etc... But the point is, THEY wil control it. And THEY will have experts talk about this and make it 'legal, safe' and put some guarantees on it for the broader public. The experts will probably always say that this new system is transparent, controlled by governments (guaranteed), has less fluctuations, safer, thiefs will get caught (meaning: less anonymous) - they will give examples of thiefs, and people will trust this new currency more.

@_date: 2017-10-29 07:05:15
The points come together. That gives it's value (I wrote, this all adds up to). You can not just take 1 point and compare it to whatever you might think of.
For example: if I mine my private coin and it cost me 5 bucks on electricity. This does not mean my coin is 5 bucks worth.
For example: If I write a code, this does not mean the code is worth something.
So... You should take all the points together: *That* gives it's current market value.

@_date: 2017-09-12 21:04:27
I think you're also missing the point, just as OP.
The way we know BTC today could never be implemented the way we know our community today.
Why would you keep track of BTC's worth? Because it jumps really high and gets low.
I could not buy local groceries with a currency like this. I would always check it and look to import stuff for half the price...
The way we know BTC today combined with our currencies today would make a pack milk cost 1 dollar now and in the evening it would cost 1 dollar 50 cents. Why? Because traders (shops, markets, etc... ) keep an eye on their market.
However if you cut all other currencies off and just leave us with BTC that would be another story. But this would mean 'ALL' money should be invested in BTC - which is impossible: Rich people have lots to lose, also governments and other high ranked individuals...

Yeah, and then go back to a million. That's what we all hope for.
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:00:51
Yeah, I'm also wondering... What if china goes off the grid. Will the miners mine further and create another chain of Bitcoin?
In the meantime the other half (outside china) is also calculating making another chain.
On both networks people buying, selling, using Bitcoin. So it would be a totally different reality of spending bitcoins/wallets.
What happens if both parties (with different values of bitcoins bought/sent/stored) get connected again?
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:01:19
Yeah, just like MtGox... All coins blocked...

@_date: 2017-10-09 04:27:05
You mean 'the loud minority', because clearly if the big exchanges decide to support an altcoin then that's what the big (naive, dum) masses will buy.

He's been an early adaptor. Has multiple webshops accepting Bitcoin. And owns important websites from the early start.
You could say he was a truly believer, therefore investing a huge amount of his wealth in Bitcoin. He never let go of the websites although they are worth in the millions which even means he is a devout Bitcoiner who would not quickly panic sell.
If he would panic sell, he would also sell of his websites and webshops. Therefore incorrect to the guys assuming that he is a panic seller.

I don't understand that this news - if true - is good for Bitcoin, bad for China? It's the same if you say - what doesn't kill me makes me stronger... So if you're in a coma you are stronger than before?
If it's true, other governments could follow and make it really difficult for Bitcoin...
We know you're gonna say "governments can't ban Bitcoin" - that's why I said "really difficult", but definitely not good for Bitcoin! Even the rumours are not good for Bitcoin!

People would massively invest in the new backed coin perhaps?
We already seen coins as ZCash which gave the founder fee.
What about LISK who made the option to choose a delegate.
The ideas are in the hundreds...
China could implement these and sell certificated hardware to mine these altcoins. It's a win-win. Run their own exchanges and tiny fees will add up, just like bittex' fees.
People don't like this because the government gets involved. Well newsflash: this is how the world works.

Hey dude. I'm sorry, I will give it another shot. I was like I don't care, you must be another fanboy... To the moon, hodl, etc...
Anyways, I apologize.
What I was trying to say, china could make a coin exactly like Bitcoin or another altcoin where they can't loose... Example given ZCash, LISK etc...
They can introduce a system like the altcoins mentioned  above. Or introduce a fee, a really small fee just like bittrex when you buy coins. This will add up.
They will make it legitimate and then the Yuan will definitely fade out. Why do you think this won't work? Because a government gets involved? This is how the world works man.
Bitcoin won't work the way we know it at the moment in our communities the way we know them.

@_date: 2017-10-10 05:59:31
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
If s2x succeeds, we could still hijack it back at a later point. So it's not that big of a deal.
People like to see this as a make or break point. If s2x can hijack Bitcoin, then we can hijack it back. So no problem. Trust me. I'm 1 of the masses.

@_date: 2017-10-19 00:22:53
Totally agree. In my opinion the biggest advantages are as mentioned before: decentralization (trust no one, privacy, own money = own security ) and transparency (open platform, no printing of extra money)
The other points may gradually be implemented by classic fiat (speed, convenience, digital money: online/offline storage, low fees).

*When you sign up for the first time*
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome onboard Flight BT1 BTC with service from Crypto-city to Altcoin-city. We are currently fueling the plane for take-off and are expected to be in the air in approximately seven blocks of time. We ask that you please fasten your seatbelts at this time and secure all wallets online ánd offline. We also ask that your keys are safe and your altcoins in the bullish position for take-off. Please get rid off all your paper prints, including digital back-ups, which are worse than any random ICO. Selling is prohibited for the duration of the flight. Thank you for choosing Moon Airlines. Enjoy your flight.
*During the flight*
Good afternoon passengers. This is your captain speaking. First I'd like to welcome everyone on the Swing Flight BT1. We are currently cruising at an altitude of 57,000 feet at an airvolume of 130 btc per hour. The time is 1 o'block. The weather looks good and with the orderbook on our side we are expecting to land in Altcoin-city approximately fifteen blocks ahead of schedule. The weather in Altcoin-city is cloudy and rainy, with an all time low of minus 4 degrees for this shitty city. This means we would not have a great view of the Altcoins airdropping as we descend over it. The Altcoin-developers will be coming around in about twenty blocks of time to offer you BT2 and BCH and some Domo, please do not accept this. I'll talk to you again before we reach our destination. Until then, sit back, relax and enjoy the rest of the flight.
*Safety first*
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the crew I ask that you please direct your attention to the monitors above as we review the Altcoins dropping. There are currently six Altcoins slowing down this aircraft. Take a minute to locate your Altcoins in your wallets. Note that the highest Altcoin spiking may be plumping without a warning. Count the number of pumps and take your profit before a sudden death. Should the cabin experience sudden altitude loss, stay calm, hold and listen for instructions from the core developers. Dollar cost average will pull down your highest buying point. Place the order in the orderbook, like this. Drop a limit order to get a free registration. In the unlikely event of a hijack leave your full nodes running. Supports are located above anyone's guess and emergency drops will lead you to panic sell. If you are traveling with children, make sure that you let them pull up an extra full node. We ask that you make sure that all your coins are stowed away safely during the dip. While we recalculate our new destination, please take a moment to zoom out on the graph in the seat pocket in front of you.

What do you mean 'whats the point'? The point is transparency, decentralization, trust. Fast (should be). Low cost.
If Disney has all of this above, then we (the market, the masses) choose. If Disney prevails, then so be it.
Blockchain is the future, we just don't know which one will prevail. I'm sure you agree with this? Do you understand the point?
If you're concerned about criminals: Bitcoin is very transparent. Criminals also use bank accounts (the biggest criminals are the ceo's lol). And criminals also use land and stuff. A criminal is a criminal, he'll always find something.

In Morocco they use 4 different denominations for 1 currency.

2 DORO in the North (they double the amount)
100 Francs (they count to the decimals)
20 Riyal in the west (they double and do a tenfold)
This all for 1 exact currency. They like mathematics I guess?

Haha... No.
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:01:56
Yes, but you need to mine 24/7 so you'll be mining bitcoins worth more than buying bitcoins. Calculations show buying:mining ratio for 1 year is approx. 3:4
So eventually you'll be buying 1000 bucks of Bitcoin or mine 1200 worth of Bitcoin and then sell your hardware for a few bucks.
The question is now is it worth it? The market is volatile which will not guarantee your investment, and you'll also need to spend 'time' on your machine which you would rather spend watching in Bitcoin graphs... I mean in your social life.

We can check the volumes at coinmarketcap? We take the biggest exchanges and add up the bitcoins no?
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:32:04
Yeah, I see there are a few questions posted. 
My concern is about the banking world. People underestimate their value and their power at the moment.
I'm not telling Bitcoin can not succeed. But at this moment Bitcoin is really weak.
Suppose if Bitcoin is really a threat to the banking world and they know it's value, then Bitcoin could be easely terminated. This means:
The banking world could easely buy as much as Bitcoin that they want. This means the Bitcoins that keep in circulation will get a higher price, and there will be a higher demand. Bitcoin can be devided in terms of value, mBitcoin, satoshie and so forth... 
However, at the current market cap, the banking world could:
1/ Destabilize the market at the current market price = they win.
2/ Get very, very rich because of their investment = get very powerful = destabilize the market at a very high market price = they win.
3/ Openly declare that they own millions of bitcoins. People will get afraid and won't buy Bitcoin = they win.
What I'm understanding is that Bitcoin is very weak at the moment. However I see people being very euforic. Overvaluing themselves (at the moment). Declaring war against the banking world. Thinking that they are powerful. At this marketcap I think it's wise to stay low.
What are your thoughts about this?

Hey man. Just want to wake you up from your dream. Sorry.
Jamie Dimon is a very powerful man. They can buy so many Bitcoin, you'd be panic selling before you know it. The marketcap is peanuts for them. Just telling you the harsh truth.
Think about it:
1/ They can buy so much Bitcoin to a point where they could easily destabilize the market. It will be like you being their personal slave.
2/ They can buy so much Bitcoin, only a limited amount will be left. Allright bitcoins can be devided, we know: so the price goes up (meaning every Bitcoin will be cut into pieces on demand of the market)... That means they will be super, super, super rich. If the price goes down, they have won and destroyed the Bitcoin. They can loose those billions. They know people who know people who know people.
Sorry to destroy your fantasy.

There is no threshold. I'm going for 5 years. I'm not pulling back if it gets lower than my initial buying point nor would I pull back before 5 years. In that time period a lot of things will emerge.
I'm also thinking of 2025 to see were this blockchain technology goes. Some altcoins have 5 year plans, so I guess that's a good start.
If there's no return to the dollar economy, that's even better.

You're delusional.
We all know Bitcoin can go high or can go low. But you are the one putting this number 90%. Yes, it can happen but you can't imagine how. Maybe when all countries ban Bitcoin and it goes underground. Ok.
Maybe when tether dollars collapse and 3 of the biggest exchanges get hacked and emptied, 3 times in a row.
Maybe when there is an EMP.
Maybe when there's a big flaw implemented in Bitcoin by insiders.
Maybe when a new system gets introduced.
It could all happen... But not just like that. You're basically telling him to wait for that moment when everyone is backing out and lost confidence. There's only one way in that case: down, down, down.
Exchanges in your example (the big banks collapsing) were backed by the governments. If Bitcoin collapse no one will back it up. They will be happy.

It was a hoax from a Bitcoin fanboy.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:05:16
That's a good idea. I think the best idea is just to merely visualize bitcoin in both denominations.
Maybe confusing, but you'll still have buyers. I don't think you will lose buyers. I think there would be some people thinking they bought in at a lower price. But the truth is, it's the same book, same coin. Just a different visualization in your online wallet (showing both) and on the front page of the exchange. This would greatly improve adoption.
I'm down for this idea.

Hey, I don't want to interrupt but  made a good point.
As for the difference you mentioned, then it's obsolete. You can still deposit some fiat(-stored-under-your-matress = cold wallet) in a bank (instantly) and transfer it (instantly).
The Project for instapayment is being built in Europe (or send it to Paypal and then send it worldwide).
I think you should use other advantages.

What do you think of people comparing Bitcoin to buying a can-of-coke for 1000 bucks and hoping to try to sell it for 2000 bucks?
Or comparing Bitcoin to selling water in the desert for 1000 bucks a gallon?
Or digging a hole in your backyard and selling the hole for 1000 bucks?

From what I understood, every chain will act independently.
Once they reconnect the longest chain will take over and will be the original chain. Not sure what will happen with your payments on the island. I think they will get invalidated (rollback), since you belong to the shortest chain and nothing happened before the 'seperation'.
Which is actually a mess for the people on the island (but not for the people who are invested in the longest chain).
On the other hand, a simple satellite connection would sync both chains instantly. So it's a hypothetical situation.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:11:49

Lol Bitcoin will never ever go to 0, the minimum it will ever go if a nuclear disaster happens would be 1000-1500 bucks.
Anyways, if you want significant returns you need to invest significantly. That means if 30 bucks is huge to you, you will get a return of 100% and will have 60% which is in your view superduper.
So, if a millionaire want to have signifacant return he needs to buy in millions!

Nethead was such a jerk using multiple accounts to attack Roger Ver.

You register on an exchange or a bitcoin shop/market.
An exchange connects a buyer in fiat with you as a seller. You could sell on an exchange or in real life or on a decentralized exchange, or in a shop, or in a market. Online or offline. You still sell your Bitcoin and someone pays you. Not the bank?

On another note BTC is hanging there under 4000 dollars, and the weekend is coming. So not sure what to make out all of this. Previously 'experts' told us that the 3400-3600 is the real drop. Nobody knows. Could be true, could be lower. We don't know.

Hey, I think you're missing the point.
The situation we are visualizing is you will pay your milk in Bitcoin. The seller in the shop will pay his rent in Bitcoin. The owner of the shop will pay his bills in Bitcoin.
Your employer pays you in bitcoin, you buy a house with bitcoins, the seller buys a car in Bitcoin. The merchant pays his suppliers in Bitcoin. The suppliers buy their milk with Bitcoin.
So, this whole story is getting paid by and pay with Bitcoin.

Yeah, but he lives in the principle "invest what you can afford to lose". If he loses, he doesn't care. He will be living in the camping looking for a job and eventually living on the social security system (meaning: sleeping-slave-taxpayers will pay for his living, wich I am all OK with).

It could be valuable, if it is distributed in a limited setting (it doesn't need to be mined, but could be mined = "free" (additional) security, verifications). And most importantly being transparant (community needs to check up flaws and drawbacks).
It could be set up against bitcoin, but Bitcoin will destroy Russia's value if they did.
So best, safest way is inventing a digital currency for Russia. Now they can cut cost on 'printing' (paper and ink) money. They just add zero's and it's done. No more printing.

Hey man, you must be also looking at usd when buying altcoins, lol?
You're doing it wrong. When buying/selling BTC you should watch USD. They run the game.
When buying/Selling altcoins, you should watch it in BTC. They are running the game.
You can watch it in euro, but not use it as "An all time high, support or resistance", because the price gets decided by USD. They are the biggest players. They decided 3000 bucks was the bottom a month ago, not in euro. They also decided that 5000 was the resistance, not the euro.
Every other currency just gets alligned by arbitrage (with Bots).
This is the same for altcoins. Their worth is in Bitcoins, not in usd.

People would massively invest in the new backed coin perhaps?
We already seen coins as ZCash which gave the founder fee.
What about LISK who made the option to choose a delegate.
The ideas are in the hundreds...
China could implement these and sell certificated hardware to mine these altcoins. It's a win-win. Run their own exchanges and tiny fees will add up, just like bittex' fees.

If all countries ban, then Bitcoin would probably be worth between 500 - 1000 bucks.
There would be no real open inclusive market for Bitcoin.
However, another coin would rise, maybe backed by the new world order. I don't give a damn. Some other coin will prevail.
As far as I know, we did not took a pledge to defend Bitcoin to death. It's just the idea. It's not 100% ideal, but if it's not Bitcoin then another coin backed by entities.

Hey, I just go to the ATM, it's open 24/7. It counts and filters counterfeits and then you can deposit (instantly) or cancel the transaction.
I know there are different advantages but I was talking about holding your fiat under your matress and then deposit it when you need it. Is allmost the same as holding your BTC offline and then deposit the BTC to send it to someone online.
The fast payments are not really an advantage because they are (seriously) working on it.
Chargebacks, trust, privacy etc... are good points! I was just pointing out these 2 points.

So you'd put the order at 2280 pnds or something, ... because Americans are the biggest players. They decide this rollercoaster.

600*10,000 = 6,000,000 dollars
So 6,000,000 dollars investing in shitcoins. And you won't even know if it will take 3 years 10 years or 75 years before it hits the moon.

@_date: 2017-10-31 12:35:23
If Bitcoin went to zero, that means something serious is going down: A gigantic Tether fraud has been discovered, perhaps in combination with a worldwide ban on Bitcoin. Thousands of nodes were taken down. Hundreds of developers identified and sued for betrayal. Also Satoshi has been found and he gave his keys to the authorities and the 3 biggest exchanges were hacked online and offline. And there is a better alternative than Bitcoin.
In that case I can imagine Bitcoin going down to zero.

You're being an idiot. Stop it.
If it drops 90% (90 billion bucks evaporated) we will still see topics asking 'shuld I Bay now?'. This is pure greed and pure jealousy.
When you buy at 500 bucks, would you think it will rise up? Everyone saw it dropping 90% which means we will all wait for another drop to 200 bucks. Eventually it will be a race to the bottom. An idiot's race.
TLDR: You're being an idiot. Go buy some dogecoin.

@_date: 2017-10-12 16:00:35
Yeah. You can never EVER know. Bitcoin will surprise you and up to 6500 or 7500 without giving you a warning. Then it will dip back to 5500 and people will start panicking. It would be realistic to go back to 6000, so people buying now would have a cheap Bitcoin.
But you'd never know.
Bitcoin could surprise you and go up to 6000 and then drop to 4500, making a small bearish movement to 4000 and then rise up withing 10 minutes to 5200. And continue it's rise to 6500 or even 7500.
So, basically, you'd never know!
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:09:44
Hey dude. I'm sorry, I will give it another shot. I was like I don't care, you must be another fanboy... To the moon, hodl, etc...
Anyways, I apologize.
What I was trying to say, china could make a coin exactly like Bitcoin or another altcoin where they can't loose... Example given ZCash, LISK etc...
They can introduce a system like the altcoins mentioned  above. Or introduce a fee, a really small fee just like bittrex when you buy coins. This will add up.
They will make it legitimate and then the Yuan will definitely fade out. Why do you think this won't work? Because a government gets involved? This is how the world works man.
Bitcoin won't work the way we know it at the moment in our communities the way we know them.

@_date: 2017-09-14 15:30:32
Well, to be honest. This huge rise was all because of the people panic buying. This drop (starting to become huge) is all because of the same kind of people panic selling.
In between are the traders.
People hearing stories of miners back in 2012 or something and they are now millionaires. People hearing BTC will hit a million. People hearing fiat will die... People love to hear these kind of things "guaranteed profit".
On another note: people who bought at 300, 400, 500 should be happy that these people were in board coz they are the ones who made Bitcoin hit the 5000. Without them Bitcoin would be still around 500 because there are different coins which are cheaper and better.

It seems like you are a very rich man, a very young person, or a very naive adult.
The whole market is based upon buying and selling of 1 decimal.
That being said, when a normal guy buys his groceries we talk about 200 bucks a week, this means everything goes 25% up or 25% down. Which means you pay 250 bucks per week (or 150 bucks), that is a difference of 100 bucks in 1 week! This is not just the milk we are talking about...
That is even better than buying a promotion. All the electronics and supermarkets are relying on their promotions. They have huge departments calculating prices and adding/deleting promotions. But in your world this is all abundance.
And I'm not even talking about poor countries where they litterally count every penny (I'm not talking about the greedy bankers).
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:45:39
I'm sure there are plenty of other people just like me who are greedy and don't believe in the 1s and 0s... However, we believe in the guys who truly believe in Bitcoin. We believe that the real believers are really dedicated to Bitcoin, but alas we don't believe in bitcoin, itself.

I agree. I do not think Bitcoin is a currency at the moment. It's too volatile. Bitcoin is for speculation. But that does not mean it's not worth it's value at this very moment.
Simply said: Bitcoin won't work as we know it at the moment, in our communities as we know them at the moment.
Bitcoin and our communities need to change/adapt.

There are always multiple opinions on this matter. Whether you're a billionaire, or a scientist or a normal idiot. The opinions are diverse on Bitcoin.

There is no transparency. I don't believe the community let it slide through.
Come on. An exchange inventing a centralized cryptocurrency (tether) and they themselves claim every tether is backed by a dollar. And then they can print it out like crazy. They can do anything with these tethers and people do not care.

In reality BTC goes up 1000 bucks in 24h breaking ATH, newspapers take up this story.
People on Reddit open topics to talk about this spike.
BTC goes down 200 bucks, 100 bucks, 50 bucks. Or even when Bitcoin stabilizes: a lot of noobs, kids and childish grown ups open topics why BTC is going down/not going up? Is BTC ready to crash?

These are the parts they never tell you when you buy Bitcoin (or any other crypto). I read a bunch of articles how fiat is devalued and printed out of thin air... And now we just double the coins for everybody.
However, stuff like these are the 'things-that-we-do-not-mention'... Imagine telling this to the broader public? This will get us roasted, especially since we talk about 'limitless fiat printing',... 'trust',... 'guaranteed',... 'decentralize',... When we only like to talk about the good parts of Bitcoin then it's the same as only talk about the good parts of fiat.

Pray is a big word... We do not know the current value. But we know exactly how much it is worth at minimum:

-Hundreds of developers spend their time freely. This has value.
-Thousands of businesses are built around Bitcoin. Making solutions, selling Bitcoin, selling stuff that is about Bitcoin: hardware as software solutions. This has value.
-Thousands of businesses are thinking of stepping into Bitcoin (or Ethereum as you like). This has value.
-Mining a bitcoin will cost you up to 1000-1250 dollars. This *is* a value.
-Mining utilities add up to the resilience of the network in a tremendous number expressed in hashrate. This has value.
-Decentralization (worldwide trust) has it's value.
-The code can not be changed overnight. Robustness: This has value.
-Bitcoin is widespread and most known. This has (marketing) value.
And this all adds up to the current market value.
I'm sure there are stuff that I forgot to mention.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:40:29
Yeah, people are willing to pay these prices, but why are people convinced buying bitcoins at this price?
Partially because it has a huge user-base. A buyer is more convinced to step in if he knows bitcoin has all of that above (secure, wide community, hundreds of talented developers, big company's are getting involved, etc... ). In this case the buyer is more convinced to pay the asking price.
Now if (more and more) governments are getting involved then the price will go up because more people want to get in: the user's trust in Bitcoin will rise.
However, if there's a crackdown on Bitcoin, the price will fall to a certain level and go underground.
Again. You will ask yourself but anyone can start a coin? Yes. But not everyone can have those abilities (huge community, thousands of nodes secure the network, etc... etc... ).

When the criminals start to trade the coins they get tracked back and an alarm should go off. Especially if you need to verify.

You could mine it all by yourselves, but expect returns in 1-2 years depending the value of Bitcoin.
Basically you could buy 1 (or a piece of it) with a value of 5600 bucks. Or you could try to mine 1 with a value of 4000 bucks, but you'll lose a lot of time.

Note to self:

Right now it clearly is not worth it's value, that's why it's droppin. The reason why it's not worth it's value is a different story. Next week it could be worth 5000. The people are putting a value to Bitcoin - depending of simple markets. If you were all alone, it would be worth nothing.
It's really simple. People put value to Bitcoin. And now people don't find it appealing to buy at 4000. It's a shame you don't understand these basics.
