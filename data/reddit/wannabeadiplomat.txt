Bitcoin itself is still in beta so we may wait a bit...
@_date: 2018-09-17 03:46:25
While I generally agree, it depends a bit on the trigger. If runaway inflation in a few key currencies is the trigger, something like bitcoin may be impacted way less than if the trigger for the crisis is the collapse of major companies. We shall see.

I think that while it may look as a shortcoming it is actually an advantage right now. If bitcoin was fully anonymous, we would face much more pressure from governments and it would be much more easy to paint it as something evil.
I am not worried we will figure the whole anonymity shabang out. Until then however we get so entrenched everywhere that bitcoin itself cannot be attacked anymore.

I think it’s ok if we label that site as scam. Bitcoin is a complex topic one needs to understand well. Any half smart person will also look at trusted resources such as Wikipedia before forming an opinion and using it. Those people that judge a technology by only looking at the first site ending with a .com are probably very easy to dupe and thus very likely to be disappointed anyways.
I’m all for adoption, but right now we are still in a phase where one needs various sources to properly understand how bitcoin works. And marking those sources that send out misleading messages or have unclear agendas as scam is important.

Now now, don’t be so surprised that people don’t know this. I for one didn’t know either and am glad he asked.

I think it is very interesting that bitcoin recently moved the opposite way stock markets or currencies like the euro did. The more that happens, the more bitcoin will be perceived as an uncorrelated asset. And the more that happens, the more it will be attractive for regular investors to keep some on their portfolio.

I do care and I’m not moving. There are things such as family ties etc.

If the market crashes and I loose my job, I will have to sell my crypto to survive...

Is this wallet using lightning in some way, shape or form?
@_date: 2019-03-08 04:47:56
I honestly wouldn’t ascribe Marc Zukeburg any particularly brilliant brain... I feel he was just in the right place at the right time and hat the grit to push through the initial problems.
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:50:06
Read up on the lightning network. It is basically a second layer that reduces the load on the Blockchain because instead of writing every transaction to it only balance changes are stored at much larger intervals (I know I am oversimplifying)
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:03:55
If you keep having to sell your BTC that means you don’t have a sustainable lifestyle. It looks as if you spend more than you can afford. In the example with your car you had to sell your btc because you didn’t have an emergency fund, you choose inadequate insurance and so on. My advice is to head over to the guys at personalfinance and restructure your financial life.
@_date: 2018-06-12 04:05:14
Can you shed some light on why you invested in bitcoin? Was it because you wanted to make some money or because you saw some value in the amazing technology?
@_date: 2019-02-22 04:51:47
They do support imap, you just have to activate it in the option. Plus ProtonVPN is quite amazing as well...
@_date: 2019-02-15 04:58:59
Well, someone still needs to create an invoice. I think the day lightning supports sending money through push rather than pull it will be amazing.
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:59:17
Well, difficulty automatically adjust downwards and the overall supply will stay the same. That’s the magic of bitcoin. So there is only a short-term reduction in velocity.
@_date: 2019-04-11 03:55:55
Believe me: if transactions got cheap enough I would start using the bitcoin blockchain to backup my valuable family photos in it. That way they would never get lost. And if I think that way, imagine how else you could use a cheap blockchain...

He said it could, not it will

I am a big fan of mast, Schnorr and coinjoin but in the broader scale of things I am almost more excited about developments within the Lightning network protocol. Things such as Watchtowers, Eltoo, submarine swaps... and ultimately a more seamless/transparent integration of lightning and regular bitcoin payments. It would be amazing if an end user would not need to understand how funds are exchanged. Open an app, transfer funds, that’s it. No more talk about lightning, bech32, opening channels etc. Just pay.
My biggest fear is that some kind of price FOMO sets in too quickly and Lightning is not mature enough to show the world that bitcoin can easily handle quick and inexpensive transactions even under heavy load.
@_date: 2019-04-26 03:55:04
Which mobile client are you referring to? You know, lightning is a technology, not a mobile wallet. There are many many mobile wallets that use the lightning technology.
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:59:01
Not to 0 but to the lowest buy order in the order book. If he sells at market price.
@_date: 2019-01-28 05:04:12
Good points but don’t bet on lightning to ever get to 1.0 so soon. Even a decade after its launch, the bitcoin client itself is still not 1.0. But for me that’s fine as it is.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:00:53
Do you plan on supporting lightning?
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:06:38
As soon as you plan on making multiple transactions it makes sense to open a channel. A on-chain transaction really only makes sense if you want to pay someone only once.
@_date: 2018-07-05 04:10:06
Did you not read what he wrote?
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:33:41
Isn’t the bitcoin client itself still in beta?
@_date: 2018-07-11 04:12:52
I think he refers to mainnet iOS wallets. Unless I missed something, the only one ready for mainnet requires a node to be set up as well. I am craving to start using lightning but I can’t find simple solutions yet. So I currently have to pay merchants with regular bitcoin transactions. And no Satoshi.place for me either. So I kind of agree with his point
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:55:49
Well... I guess I'd rather have Segwit compatible bitcoins
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:07:29
Thanks! It's a tad shaky and I envy those that take those amazingly perfect videos... but I had fun! Keep hodling

Because, for instance, try to explain to the tax man why you suddenly could afford a Lamborghini on that measly income.

And I am actually also selling a Villa for 829 BTC... in Switzerland: 
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:03:11
I personally think it will only make it more confusing. “Ok, I have my bitcoins, let’s pay” “Oh no, you need this spedn app to pay with bitcoins”, “But I have some in BlueWallet”, “You can’t pay with those... you need the spedn app”, “So are there different kinds of bitcoin???”
I am glad they didn’t come up with a spedn-coin, but isn’t it ultimately the same if you are bound to their app and ecosystem?

It's a house I inherited but it's simply too big for me. Imagine cleaning it, maintaining it... I live alone so it's simply too much. It's a rational choice even though you are right, the views are amazing...
