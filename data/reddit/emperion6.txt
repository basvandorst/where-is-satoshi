One of the leaders of Maidsafe has responded saying that the address shouldn't be Bitstamp's as they are not supposed to know the keys of wallets they use with the exchange

I would imagine they will add that in the future. It is currently under the more information tab. It would be nice to be able to search for bitcoin in the search bar though.

Almost every mining contract will lose you money, most of them don't have above a 90% ROI, some even lower than that. As difficulties rise the mining yield decreases and you will lose money over time. Some of them are even ponzi schemes, there is no way to tell if a cloud mining service actually has hardware or they are just paying you with other user's investments. All in all I would recommend avoiding a mining contract as an investment, but if you would like to try it out for the experience (it is kinda fun, and you learn a little bit) I would recommend you read this article on my website. One of my writers did a whole experiment on [mining without hardware](
