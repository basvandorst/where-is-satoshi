Because they are attacked here if they openly support BU

That's a very good question isn't it? You're starting to ask the right questions now.

Guess they realized the value of a single BTC was going to be very high. Bullish.

Is litecoin actively counting segwit votes for activation?? If so I didn't know this.

1MB in 2019? You gotta be joking. That's still not sufficient.

Wow fascinating. Thanks.
I wonder what makes them feel 75% is safe and acceptable for a soft fork.

My point has been made.

The evidence is his holdings! He has hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin. Only a total idiot would destroy their own holdings. That is the proof.

Roger is MORE inclined to make bitcoin valuable than those who hold less bitcoin. OP is trying to fit a round peg into a square hole with this logic.

Ah. I see now.
It probably should have said "6048/8064" blocks needed, I think?
6048/6048 implies 100% of the blocks in a 6048-block period.
6048/8064 implies 75%  of the blocks in a 8064-block period.

...and stagnates (currently).
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:23:48
Would love a clarification of the title then. Thanks for being so helpful
@_date: 2017-04-27 00:22:53
So let me understand this: if one non-SW block gets mined during period 6, then SW doesn't activate? If so, then it seems pretty likely it won't activate doesn't it?

"apostrophe" = "epiphany" ?

Great video. Thank you for sharing. I think it's important for the (often younger members of the) crypto community to be aware of this, rather by being blindsided by it later and finding themselves liable for backtaxes owed accompanied by fines.
1. Where did you get the figures of 39.6% (income tax) and 20% (capital gains tax) from? Are these fairly standard in the US? I thought income tax was closer to 30%.
2. Does your video apply equally to crypto-to-crypto trades as it does with crypto-to-fiat trades?
3. If I give crypto to someone as a gift, are they (and myself) exempt from taxes on it, up to a certain dollar amount?

I think from the current hashrate support for Segwit / BU
@_date: 2017-06-03 05:23:57
Thank you very much.

But he's correct imo
