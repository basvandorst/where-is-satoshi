Kraken has been 98% shitty these past 6 months or so.  
That said, at least for me (in Europe), their SEPA transfers usually get through without any issues.  
Purchasing any crypto or withdrawing them from Kraken is where you'll probably run into issues as you'll probably go nuts clicking the buy button and getting error after error. Still, after a few dozen tries it usually goes through.  
So, for your sanity's sake, if you have any other alternatives, please consider them all before using Kraken.

I'd wait until (or if) bitcoin drops to $4k or under and buy 1 bitcoin and the remaining $1k in other relatively stable and rising coins like ethereum, monero, litecoin, etc. Or maybe even split it 50% bitcoin and 50% altcoins.
I'm sure a lot of people will disagree and recommend going all in on bitcoin (this is after all) which is also a good decision especially if you just want to hold long term. I just think that if you're going to invest in crypto, might as well put something into some newer coins that have been around for a while and have demonstrated "being stable", have good volume, have been rising overall, etc. Beware of very new coins and ICOs, do your research or just avoid all together.
If you're seriously looking into mining, you might as well look into ethereum, monero or any of the many other coins that are probably still more mineable and profitable on consumer hardware (i.e.: gfx cards) than bitcoin. There are still valuable coins and you'll have an upgradeable rig that's easier to eventually sell the parts once it stops being worth it or you upgrade cards, etc. 
Subreddits exist dedicated to mining most coins and as already suggested you can search for "mining calculator" and find useful sites to calculate profitability for most coins depending on your electricity cost and hashrate.
Just know that bitcoin is extremely hard to mine at this point for someone just starting out with a $5k investment that's why I believe most people here will always suggest buying instead.

So... you're implying that because bots are basically computer programs they somehow can only trade inside those values and multiples?
Sorry, but that's the most ridiculous thing i've read all day and a clear indication that you have no idea about how trading bots or even programming works in the first place. Base 8? ~~gtfo~~ please...

Ok, also surely 32, 16 and 8? In the future there may even be 256, 512 and who knows maybe even a 1024 wall. A sort of megawall so to speak

Sorry, but I'd also need Homer, Peter and Cartman's opinions to make any kind of coherent comment on this.

This is true, although by the time the Cruise gets there, the aliens are usually already dying from some kind of alergic reaction to our air or water.  
If all else fails, just send Jeff Goldblum with a laptop.
