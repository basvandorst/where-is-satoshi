Regardless of it's ties to Fiat currencies, it's my understanding that BTC itself wouldn't be inflationary at all due to it's limited supply, decreasing rate of release of that supply AND because of it's potential for being "infinitely" divisible (i.e. expanding past 1 Satoshi).

So that armored cars don't have to transfer all the cash all the time.  Or am I incorrect?

What's the answer?

They probably are trading futures and attempting to make it go down. 
But the supposed analysts that are writing these reports have all been missing it's intrinsic value which is this: people DO ascribe value to it and because of that it is useful as an electronic transfer of value across borders... Meaning you don't have to ship physical cash in armored cars or across the ocean....

Fractional reserve banking is necessary... Partially (if not ultimately) because of the exact reasoning I laid out.... You're acting like cryptocurrency has no use case. As if net settlements never have to occur.....  I take it you posted this article as someone that doesn't believe in crypto?

Block chain transactions easily could track lending.... ?

What you are saying makes no sense in reference to the article you posted. I'm assuming you are just trolling, or you really don't understand the financial system.  Every post I have made you have posted a rebuttal referencing something different that I nor anyone else is discussing.

Lol of course that still happens... Why do you think armored car companies still exist?  I guess you're talking about the iou type systems that exist... Ultimately there has to be an accountability in the end.  With BTC and other cryptocurrencies there doesn't need to be a physical cash accountability in the end as the value is ascribed to the digital copy itself.

Has nothing to do with volatility. Block chain tech could replace lending tracking systems. They could base the loan in the native Fiat currency and translate on the fly when converting with a reserve amount of whatever cryptocurrency it's based on.

Exactly. I didn't mention lending because I was talking about intrinsic value. You don't see cryptocurrency as having an intrinsic value associated with electronic wealth transfer without the need for secondary forms of settlements (i.e. having to ultimately possess the physical cash)?

It has to be on purpose. No one that claims to be an expert on the subject matter could make that big of a mistake. 
Forbes needs to correct this ASAP.

They deleted the article it seems...
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:06:26
What if I say you can't look up the value?

Could be bad if exchanges such as binance decide not to register and ban all US accounts... What do we do then? Get everything to an offline wallet? Gonna have way too many offline wallets with all the altcoins some people hold. But I guess technically we should all be doing that anyway.
