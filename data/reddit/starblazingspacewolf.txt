Great way to waste your life if it doesn't pan out. How about moderation? I mean I'm super bitcoin hopeful and I believer in it- but that doesn't mean anything. The truth is it's possible people will place all their eggs in the bitcoin basket in hopes of a "permanent vacation" and then when that doesn't happen, what? They wasted their life. What a stupid thing to waste your life for too. Everyone needs to go out and have some fun, live a little, kick back, go see new places.

This made zero sense. In fact it made you sound quite retarded.

You must be one of those middle aged men on Facebook or dating apps whose main photo is taken from a low angle exposing their double chain and making themselves look photographically incompetent. By far the most unflattering angle for anyone.

Buying bitcoin is like raw dogging a rando. Could turn out awesome, you had your fun and you leave amicably. Could turn out terrible. You leave with lifelong HPV, herpes and AIDS. Or, best case scenario, you could meet the love of your life that enriches your shit for decades. 
I have no idea how to judge if this is a good euphimism. I'm drinking.

Donald Trump is one stupid piece of shit. This tweet is just one tiny infantile little fraction of why. But it's another lego block in the tower of presidential retardation.

I still fail to see how the fuck a separate cyptocurrency was supposed to bring in new money for Bitcoin. The assumption that because people start to understand what cryptocurrency is, they'll buy bitcoin too?

It seems we both said things in ways we shouldn't have, perhaps. I appreciate your second response. Maybe neither of us were fully fair but had worthy points to discuss. I guess my frustration comes from being willing to take to heart criticisms of commonly seen negative behaviors of men, but feeling like often many women won't hear criticisms of women's behavior. Luckily I'm able to have good, meaningful and measured discussions with my girlfriend about this kind of stuff and wish that could be the case universally. And granted you caught me at the end of a bad day where my first response especially wasn't worded in a conducive way do I regret that. I promise I'm not a terrible dude and I'm sure in person the discussion would be much different and more meaningful. Anyway, I mean well and I'm no incel mra woman hater.

Plenty of people bought at the worst possible times.

Why would people's financial mistakes make you smile unless you're just a fucking asshole?

Nobody wants to use it when it's this volatile.

Oh shut up
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:44:02
You're condescending as fuck. Douche.
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:13:22
What's the point in convincing anyone you know to buy bitcoin? None.

You've said this over and over and over in this thread like a mentally disabled person who plugs their ears, shakes their heads and keeps repeating the same thing over and over.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:58:18
Yeah but then you just spent some of the best years of your life living like shit. Sounds fucking terrible dude. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:10:10
You write like someone nobody should ever listen to.
