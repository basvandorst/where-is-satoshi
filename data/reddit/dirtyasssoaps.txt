+.00075 BTC verify
Thanks for the encouragement. Hopefully this bitcointip works (I just set it up.)

Whoa!!! THANK YOU! My first bitcointip!! *itshappening.gif*
That made my night.
Lots of good points in your post, too. I didn't realize Blockchain offered a secondary password- there's always something to learn starting out I guess. 
As far as an encrypted desktop wallet, we haven't received so much BTC that we are uncomfortable having it in an online wallet, but hopefully that will change!
You're also right about the phone apps, I guess we only need the QR codes. I must have gotten carried away downloading shiny things.

Not really, I like them both quite a bit. Coinbase feels a bit more secure as I have to log in with a code assigned to me, and then I have to put in a unique verification which gets sent to my cellphone each time I log in (or I can opt out of the verification code for a month on the computer or phone I use to log in)
Blockchain simply requires an email and password for verification, so it's easier for me to remember on the go.
I'd say as far as sending money, they're both easy to use.
I haven't converted any BTC to USD so I'm not sure how quickly it goes or how fluid it is, or anything like that. I'm not planning to convert to USD, as I really want to start collecting and using BTC as much as I can.
If anyone else wants to chime in on the differences between these services, or anyone else who has converted BTC to USD, please be my guest! I'd be interested in learning more, myself.

That's why we make novelty soaps like Breaking Bad inspired [blue meth soap]( Although there definitely is a market for "traditional" soap... that's just probably a slightly different demographic than the typical redditor. :)

I use coinbase with my BitDazzle and the app on my phone/wallet I use for in-person sales is through Blockchain.

AH! I wasn't trying to be that spammy, sorry if it seems like that. I was just trying to share this experience and I thought people might think it was interesting. I had seen a bunch of other posts from businesses on this subreddit and thought this type of post was okay here.
If the consensus is that I should take down my link I'll do that.
Thanks for the heads up!
