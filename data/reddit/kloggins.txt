Prison? Oh please. This type of guy will never see the jail. The same situations with Kim Dotcom. See? They are kind of genius who destined to be rich and see no jail for the whole life. Amazing, isn't it? Wish i'll become one of them someday somehow.

Screw solar panels! I wish i could use my bitcoins on Steam Summer sale! Arrrgh
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:14:37
Wow. I don't understand how it's possible but this thread should earn a shit load of karma.


Sounds very interesting. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:39:25
You are the sample of kindness in the world of digital currency
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:28:01
I'm right here at your service. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 07:51:53
This should be placed in dictionaries and thesauruses
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:48:40
They have a higher plan and i'm pretty sure that they want to implement it, if they agreed to accept bitcoins...
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:28:14
Guys from Harvard seems to be technically smart and educated
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:33:57
Hm. I like the way you explain your position. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:40:49
Russia Today seems to be quite progressive channel. 
And i'm also glad that now i can find more info about bitcoins on TV
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:33:17
Do they missed? I mean nobody knows what they exactly have in their plans. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:55:45
Didn't heard about it before. Thx you
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:55:09
I can see the shit load of gold after it or i can use nuclear technology to conquer the world. It's profitable. Trust me. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:10:44
That's freaking disturbing. Why they can't learn that BTC is not virtual? It's digital or just "magic" =D
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:30:49
Good. I must to admit that there are a much more news about "another site added BTC to bla bla bla". 
Four or five weeks ago the situation wasn't the same.
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:51:11
That's why you didn't see 'em before ;)
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:43:46
You should change your nickname. You know... the guy who have an amazing thoughts about BTC coudn't be an idiot. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 03:56:51
There was no ban. Only warning for Russian citizens that they could be involved in some crap because of bitcoins
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:34:31
People love to use their imagination. That's why they believe in the Satoshi's early email haha
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:10:11
Australians made a great step to push Bitcoin forward. I'll pray for them doing the same scheme with BCN
@_date: 2014-06-29 03:59:39
Who are you? Silas Greaves?
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:26:37
They will accept BTC after HL3 confirmation. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:47:53
Imho retweeting is the worst idea you can do to achive your goals. 
If apple don't accept bitcoins, it means that they don't want to do this. Maybe they have some good reasons for that.
@_date: 2014-06-09 11:52:57
Everything in this capitalistic world is profitable if you can see it. Read Karl Marx bro
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:50:41
The videoclip is also amazing. I love the metaphor of how ppl doing their businesses. 
And reference to BTC  is quite good.

Secret Wu Tang album? Is there a thing?
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:59:25
So? What the moral of the story is? Sometimes it happens, sometimes not. Be sure that your friend will not doing something crazy when the opposite situation will come.
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:31:44
The language argument is invalid. Pls, try another. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:08:09
Some of this reasons are invalid.

@_date: 2014-06-26 02:07:37
This new sounds good. It give us an explanation that everybody in big rich companies have already knew about BTC but can't use 'em to avoid extra costs.
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:03:28
No. Bitcoin is not the greates financial innovation of all time. 
And it would never be. 
But BTC is a one step forward which could bring us to the bright future.
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:36:46
Like one well-known Violetta

You use your bitcoins to pay hooker for her job. Nice?
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:25:43
Mr Assange doesn't seems to be a whistleblower, but i'm not sure that he is good at btc system.
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:31:24
Bitcoin tech has no chance to revolutionise everything. Forget about. It's a sweet dreams without a future.
But it has a great chance to change somebody's mind.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:30:17
Reason ten: now you realized that bitcoin is a freaking magic internet currency
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:52:59
And me too
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:38:10
That's why i like BTC community. There are a lot of nice guys who a ready to help and give an advice!
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:01:23
You've paid digital currency for digital 8-bit ale? Lol. Awesome. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:46:18
This idea can turn into a new very famous profession in the future. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:26:00
Bad for you. But they will never accept Bitcoins 
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:28:29
I'm in love with oldschool meme. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:28:21
I think we have a new meaning of the world "ridiculous". 
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:37:34
Decentralised eBay? How it should work? What role will bitcoin play? 
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:23:31
Did somebody answer "Steam summer sale"? 
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:42:50
I love your style. But i also love what you writing. Your thoguhs is very clear and i'm totally agree with you. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:02:39
Yeah that's why everybody love BTC
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:27:30
Thx you. New video about BTC every day?! Amazing!
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:37:53
If attack is possbile - it will happen. Especially after you realize that bitcoin is a proof-of-work based coin and that's why it's vulnerable to a 51% attack.
Btw, what attack we are talking about? 
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:34:33
What does "floodgates" mean? Is it a system to defend bitcoins from deflation? 
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:43:34
Seems to be fake.
P.S. You will never be hacked if you'll follow a few simple rules.
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:29:25
Yep. Saw the same topic about Brothel accepted bitcoin in England. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:02:20
I'll put my comment here, can you place a link of this video when it comes?
It's about BTC  so i can't miss it
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:42:21
What this topic is about? 
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:37:30
I agree and this isn't funny anymore. I prefer to see real names isnstead of mythical Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:52:32
They are not similar. Don't even compare politics with BTC. Please. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:31:30
So? What we gonna do? 
There are a lot of threads about misterious 51% but nobody knows what should we do.
@_date: 2014-06-29 03:58:18
A lot of different things happened after February with BTC. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:26:30
Damn. I just got one. 
Scams want to catch us. But they won't
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:41:10
Thx you sir. You explained everything correctly and now i have no need to do the same. *Thumbs up!*
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:27:37
I also would like to buy Satoshi's id. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:27:00
Bitcoin has a right to exist only and since people want to use it. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:22:10
Sad but true.
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:33:49
It was very interesting to read you. My thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:47:35
I don't need to ask Jeffrey Tucker to understand, that bitcoin woudn't replace gold because i have my own brain.
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:54:04
Seems like we are neighboors
@_date: 2014-06-09 11:53:52
Yeah it will be good. I'm not sure that BTC can do it, but it can change situation for a little while
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:26:10
+1. All Satoshi's "final something" seems to be fake. People just want to believe in it. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:59:26
So you are sure that Satoshi is so stupid that he would never change his style to anonymize himself? Pfff, don't make me laugh
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:48:14
It's not actually an interview. It's a prearranged video wich was captured and processed in the studio. I wouldn't be surprised if I'll find out that there is a fake.
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:53:55
Lol. The Internet is full of these jokes after California said that they gonna legalize Bitcoins...
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:29:03
Doesn't understand why. Can you explain please?
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:29:49
Satoshi is a smart guy... or girl. Who knows?
But i'm agree that BTC is all about trust.
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:53:17
That's all you can say?
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:28:16
Btc wouldn't hurt his business i must to say.
But i don't think that improvement will be great
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:34:47
Temperature rising!
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:26:04
Why coinbase need to have instant buyback system?
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:35:01
It doesn't prove anything. I can type in that way. But i'm not Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-06-05 07:20:53
I have a doubts. Did i open BTC subreddit? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:37:46
Good for you, man. Good for you. 
Btw, the moral of your nice story is the main thought of guys who play in casinos
@_date: 2014-06-29 03:59:03
What doesn't kill you **doesn't** makes you stronger. At least, you can live a little longer. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 07:39:31
I have +1 for your list
Also never use untrusted machine. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:17:36
Oh my god! Call Ben Franklin, coz we need his face to be placed on the frontpage!
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:52:48

@_date: 2014-06-22 16:25:40
Now i want to hear you btches screaming about anonimity. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:16:49
Intersting article. I'm sure that Barry Silbert knows much more about the future of BTC and Wall Street, but the fact that they can't predict the price of Bitcoin makes me a little bit... scarry.
