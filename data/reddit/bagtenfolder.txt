It does, you just don't seem to have put a little effort into understanding the software.
Bank statements (screenstates) are verified with an awesome tool called page signer. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:48:19
Ok, understood. Thx for clarifying.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:01:24
Ew, a centralized company doing KYC? How does that relate to the thread?
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:55:47
You were complaining about the arbiters not being able to tell if a statement is shopped. The info about how that is handled is widely available.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:42:44
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:59:52


I don't think it is. After doing the learning curve it is trivial.


1) Easy is a relative term. I'm pretty tech savy but couldn't do it. You can make it as hard as possible, too. (Tear the paper apart...)
2) It further reduces the number of potential scammers. The trading limit is another exapmle for that.
3) If there is a way of successful scamming, it's easy to just changing or stop using that part. There won't be 1000s of lost coins as with centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:22:45
There might be a way with future tools. Cltv is a nice idea but I think ACH can be reversed for 48 days or something stupid like that.
Bisq can always adapt. Right now it kinda contradicts the security model and won't happen soon, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:26:33
When you sell BTC, the buyer deposits directly into your bank account.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:49:46
were tested as base currency but hardly used.
BTC based pairs do significatly better. You can do 100+ btc pairs.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:28:42
That's the security deposit. It exists to encourages the traders to follow the protocol.
If you don't have any BTC you can ask a friend, do a small trade on lbtc or do work for the amount.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:45:21
You can trade BTC to most relevant cryptos on Bisq.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:55:49
Yeah, you're right.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:46:57
ACH is trivial to reverse.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:47:45
It is supported but no trades happened, yet.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:24:56
One hack is to run Bisq on a VPS that you connect to via your mobile. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:46:04
Which currency would that be? Most currencies are supported.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:28:26
Just like with any bank transfer. That's not Bisq specific.
Edit: Additionally, anti-terrorism-laws , anti-drug-laws and aml-laws are so fucking arbitrary, that if you're the one to be fucked, you will be.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:47:41
There is none. You can start right away.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:39:14
Almost two years, no scams. Incentive and security model do their job well.
I have yet to see a SEPA transfer being reversed.


Trust is pretty much removed from the protocol. The goal is to remove it completely. The devs have been working on this for 3+ years for free. This way you can tell their determination to build the best and safest exchange for cryptocurrencies. The arbitration system needs some more decentralization but that will happen as time does it's thing.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:15:45
Ok, thanks for the info. 
That's why P2P fiat is superior. No KYC needed.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:35:35
Danish Kroner is supported. You can create a 'National bank' account for national bank transfer.
You might be able to do SEPA transfers as well. You might want to check if you can set your bank account to EUR. I'm not sure how that works.
That being said, there have been no DKK trades, yet, as opposed to SEK and NOK. It would be great if you could put-up an offer or two.
If you want to trade easily, you should check if you can do EUR SEPA transfers from you bank account.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:32:54
Sounds weird. Care to explain how it should?
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:01:17
I really don't know, sorry. Here a reference I found: 
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:51:57
Thanks, that's not true. BTC is always on one side of the trade.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:47:19




You need a security deposit for every trade. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:40:09
Cash deposit, no f2f, though.

Comment of the day! I couldn't agree more :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:49:00
It's crazy to think that by accepting money from a criminal, you're criminalized, too. I can think of hundreds of examples where there's no way for you to tell.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:39:05
As soon as it's implemented in bitcoinj.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:48:22
How does the fiat part work?
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:20:43
wtf, satoshi didn't have any empirical data as a foundation to further Bitcoin development. stop worshiping outdated shit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:50:00
congrats on a well thought-out post even though it lacks some fundamentals.


Money primarily is a unit of account that is attached to a certain value. 








That's correct for fiat money, but it's only half of the truth when you talk about Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a protocol that takes it's value from **Decentralization** and therefore **censorship resistance**. It's a paradigm change that enables all humans to be financially sovereign for the first time in history.
While this is impressing in itself, money is just the first application. There will be many more. 
Think of the (Bitcoin) blockchain, the most secure computer network in the world with ,currently, a $280+billion bounty on it's back. It enables us to immutably prove identity, ownership, birth, death, just anything you can think of.
We as humans will be able to take back our sovereignty and transform from sheeples to free individuals.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:48:51
Got it, thanks.
@_date: 2018-09-13 07:45:48
- When they'll clarify their dispute resolution process?
It's in the the existing documentation.
- When they'll have arbitrators other than the developer?
They already have.
- When those arbitrators will be in the DAO with tokens at stake?
Right now they have 4 years of work at stake.
- When will they develop a Custodian of Records policy for the National Photo ID documents they request?
Huh, no one requests that for the regular trading process. If by 'they' you mean the arbitrators in cases of dispute, that would be missing, I guess, but what's there to gain?
That being said, only a very small number of trades go into arbitration &lt;1% Most of the cases happen due to technical difficulties and mishaps in the fiat transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:20:00


Same here, go to just any doc and you'll be patched-up quickly.

@_date: 2017-12-02 10:18:00
Why did you take the time to write this? We've been hearing that bullshit for years. It's pointless. 
No one in here want's mutable cryptos like bcash and ethereum for another reason than to make a BTC profit. Many even pass on the possibility of BTC gains because security, privacy and hassle. Which is btw about the only reason (+ some big exchanges didn't adopt yet) bcash still has some value.
I only hope you're not heavily invested in bcash because fuck-ups will inevitably happen, just like they already did with the eda. There's just no brain power behind it, and the brains don't care because the protocol and ledger are mutable due to centralization.
Bcash is just outright irresponsible (just like s2x) and will lead to the tears of many.
All of this is only remotely connected with the on- and off-chain scaling  debate. That is btw. not even important. Decentralization and immutability is, then scaling but responsibly!
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:15:46


you never could and rbf didn't change shit. 0-conf ain't safe in fuckin bcash as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:34:26


What would be the circumstances for it to be needed?
@_date: 2018-09-13 07:33:40
Yes, there is a set of incentives (reputation and financial) to follow the protocol.
The DAO exists and is documented and discussed all over the bisq communication channels. It's just not live, yet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:38:55
It's not bcash, we rather stick to tested code!
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:40:11
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:47:52
Hey thanks for the detailed reply.
As I said my opinion was just a guess based on your public statements (Reddit and blog).
I haven't read anything from you in a couple of weeks, so if you found your way out of the dark, that's highly appreciated.
BCH should be removed from bitcoin.de as it just adds confusion and enough harm has already been done. (I'm not so sure if DASH is a good idea either, but who am I)
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:26:37
It only took them like forever. One can just guess why. 
That Christoph Bergmann dude is a Bcash shill and strongly connected to bitcoin.de
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:34:45
Yeah, amazing accomplishment! This one has been requested for a long time. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:50:46
Be safe - Use Bisq!
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:36:26
As Bisq uses bitcoinj afaik, you'd have to ask them (Schildbach) about segwit implementation.
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:38:01
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:40:40
There are numerous possible actions they could take to reduce these costs. 
Firstly, it's not my fault they're doing a shitty job.
Secondly, I'm not responsible for their stupid politics.
Additionally they've kept plenty of my pizza money without ever responding to my tickets.
BitPay is a complete scam project since they associated with the Bcash crowd. Since the whole Bcash project is a scam, there are no open questions left. Furthermore, the network ain't secure.
Scammin scum!
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:42:20
Be honest, they're doing a really bad job.
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:09:19

It's backup up, so it's not the reason. Maybe something else, idk.

Yeah, hat's what centralized shitcoins do all the time, see ETH.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:54:18


That is a horrible trade-off. 
You can't change a constant, leave-out critical updates (segwit, major ingredient for a real scaling solution), set-up a single miner (Jihan), like five medium-skilled devs and a snake-oil salesman (Ver) - and expect the vanishing of the main feature - decentralization - to go without consequence.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:43:49
It makes no sense when it's centralized! People must be made aware of this scam.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:10:35
Some basic information since you seem to be new to this:
You can put your transaction into the next block anytime, you simply have to pay sufficient fees.
The reply to your question is: No, this can't be the reason.

Bitcoin doesn't need Roger. It would be a failure if it did. 
He's a highly immoral person who justifies this by claiming to be a libertarian.
The only one Roger serves is Roger. He served his monetary gain in the beginning and power by now.


He's not evil, he's being himself. I think he's genuine. His actions suggest that he's a narcissist on a power trip combined with a child not getting the toy it wants. He happens to have deep enough pockets to manipulate many people.


I don't think that's true. People all over the world use centralized services, hell even in bitcoin. M-Pesa is a good example of bootstrapping money in poor countries. You could easily do that with Bitcoin in poor countries right now. The problem is that it's a centralized solution. LN will change that soonish.Segwit put us towards the solution, and yet it was opposed by people who don't think centralization matters or don't have the cognitive ability to understand the implications of bigger blocks.
Too many people have already lost money in this bitcoin cash drama and Roger happily shows of 70m$+ orders.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:13:42

@_date: 2017-11-23 22:55:25
That was not making it obvious at all, sorry.
I'm not an expert, but as I understand it the Monero tx size is considerably bigger than BTCs. This leads to a blockchain growth that will become a problem when adoption grows faster. Monero makes use of adaptive blocksizes, so more users/txs - larger blocks. 
So again, afaict, Monero needs off-chain scaling solutions, just like BTC. Fortunately the community doesn't like to argue as much as BTCs ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:49:42


@_date: 2017-11-12 22:46:33


That's not a mistake, it's a feature!
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:38:35


Edit1&amp;2: I think this is just ~~wrong~~ not the whole picture ~~and a little bit stupid.~~
Bitcoin has many more use cases than what you want us to belive. 99% of transactions already happen, and have happened off-chain on exchanges. It was like this since MtGox came to be. People trust centralized entities with their precious money. There's no reason to believe that this will change or that people want this to change.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:15:19
You know what I think why alts are rising?
I see two reasons: A technical advantage which means **useful features** (the only one I can think of is Monero (anonymity))
You know, when creating an altcoin and adding features, the hard thing is to keep it working without destroying the incentive balance and security aspects. Lots of brain/dev power. This is why jgarzik fucked up the s2x fork.  
The second reason is that **traders would love to acquire more BTC**, so you need some trading pairs, hype cyles and pump &amp; dumps. Coins with much $$$ backing (dash, zec, bch) will rise more than potcoin for example. You can easily observe this yourself. BCH hype cycles are perfectly predictable (until they're not) so it has lots of volume.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:36:08
That is correct afaik but the ecosystem (devs, users...) is tiny.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:37:02
It's not important what you tell them, it's more important what you make them think.
You: 'I'm interested in crypto since 2012'
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:59:03
...additionally, ethereum is mutable and monero is heavy as fuck. i love monero, though because it has an advantage and use case over bitcoin - which is anonymity.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:49:52
You'll be in the next block if you're willing to pay the correct fee.

Bitcoin Cash is a scamcoin, introduced by a nacissist, a single miner and a couple of copy/paste devs. Oh, I forgot about fakesatoshi and that bodog freak. It's a scheme and I feel sorry for everyone falling for it. It made me some bucks and I hope it's all Roger's and Jihan's money.
It's nothing short of a joke and has nothing in common with Bitcoin. (Yeah some code, but that attribute fits to 100s of other altcoins)
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:47:37
Among us pro-traders, that move is called 'to pull a Roger'. 
The first mention of it was in 1929, on a Friday. I learned about it in an old paperbook called 'Narcissist Economics 101'. 
The infamous De La Soul wrote a song about it: 
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:46:13
Absolutely no one uses bch and rightfully so. This network ain't safe.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:15:45
Wow, that's an excellent reference. I'll read it later. I also recognize your username and remember you being a reasonable user. If I had seen it before posting, I wouldn't have done it.
My post was meant to oppose a typical bcash shill (which you're not).
I think it's centralized in mining (Bitmain), development (a handful of devs) and I strongly *believe* the user base is magnitudes smaller than what we are made to think at a first glance (but I wouldn't call it centralized).
Its a scam because the centralized entities have pockets so deep, that they can and do manipulate the whole ecosystem (devs, social media, hash power and markets). They do this all for their own monetary gain which I consider fraudulent.
Edit: Oh, and my post was a reply to your question: 


@_date: 2017-11-16 22:21:25
Bigger blocks -&gt; more data -&gt; higher costs for nodes -&gt; less nodes -&gt; easier to compromise and censor

Yeah nothing, I'll double down :-)
Bitcoin's main attributes that make it useful is immutability, censorship resistance and decentralisation. BCH is none of the above. It's Roger's sword on his powertrip. He doesn't see that it's made of wax by a mediocre blacksmith and can't take the heat coming forth.
And no, AWS nodes aren't decentralization.
@_date: 2019-06-05 15:15:39

Come on, raising the blocksize is something that really short-sighted people would do. It doesn't scale and would eventually kill Bitcoin by spiraling centralization pressure.

That's the reason why bisq.network was created: censorship resistance
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:46:15
I certainly agree with your statement.
However, bisq can't be forced towards AML/KYC like lbtc because of it's level of decentralization.
My hopes for openbazaar have been very high but I'm doubting the teams goals after several funding rounds and devs positions (bhoffman..) in the scaling debate.
