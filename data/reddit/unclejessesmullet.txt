Yep, happened to me. I sold on ebay several times, it usually worked out OK but on my biggest sale a guy ended up doing a chargeback after I sent the bitcoin.  I provided both ebay and paypal with proof from blockchain that I sent the bitcoin to the address he gave me, but ebay and paypal both were completely useless and gave the guy his money back. Adding a category for bitcoin on ebay is just supporting scammers.

He's normally such a goofy, light-hearted host, it's so weird seeing him just rip the guy limb from limb like that.

I'd definitely second circle.  Once you get your account set up it is really easy to use.

Is what the upvote button is for.

coinbase is pretty similar to circle.  Starting out I think you get a $100 weekly limit but you can bump that up to 300 by taking a picture of your ID.  It's also instant.

If that's true then why is he still fighting to bury the Mueller report and his tax records?

I got screwed selling bitcoin on ebay a few days ago.  Guy paid, I sent the bitcoin, then that night he disputed his payment on paypal.  At the moment the funds are showing up in my account as "held" and paypal hasn't done anything else yet, but I'm not optimistic.  
I messaged someone that the same user bought about $500 in litecoin from and apparently he did the same thing to them.

I've sold on ebay several times, and up until this last time (disputed charge on paypal) it's always gone smoothly.  People are willing to buy at higher prices on ebay to avoid the inconvenience and security issues of getting them through an exchange.  I don't think I'm screwing them by providing that option, and they're certainly not screwing me (other than this one fucking guy) by buying at 25% over market value.

I was thinking the same thing, I have bought from them twice and get several dollars less than what I paid for each time.

What "law literature" would that be?  Have you ever read any "law literature?"

These comments are so fun because you're the only one that doesn't realize you're eating pubes every time you order a pizza.

as soon as my dwolla funds go through. I'm not going to try to wait and guess at the lowest price it will hit.  
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:56:37
I desperately wanted to buy when the price hit 90, but I'm still waiting for my dwolla funds to go through and didn't want to deal with bitinstant again.  It's bittersweet seeing the price continue to drop.

I checked a couple of days ago and the order wouldn't have gone through until thursday.

just go to bitinstant.com.  You can just go pay for it at walmart or someplace and have it sent directly to your wallet without dealing with mt. gox at all.
If you don't have an address/wallet yet go to  and start one there for free and without downloading any software.

We need to put together a large group of people to all pledge to donate a specific amount of bitcoin the day wikipedia begins to accept it.  If they get one group contacting them and pledging a lump sum of, say, $10,000 and all they have to do to get it is spend 10 minutes to set up a wallet, they'd be insane to turn that down.

I used bitinstant today, payed cash at walmart.  It's not bad, fees are a bit high that way though.

I do think it will climb back up a bit.  Not back up to 250, but maybe 100 or so.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:32:15
It's back on the site, but it's not working for me.  I get a 500 - internal error every time I try.
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:36:30
Exact same thing here. Finally bought at 103 today.  huge opportunity missed.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:26:17
I'm having the same issues.  Just realized bitinstant for some reason removed that option, wtf?  That's how I bought before and the only really fast way I knew how to do it.  Very, very frustrating.  And I don't even have any of the BoA options because there's not a branch in my town.
