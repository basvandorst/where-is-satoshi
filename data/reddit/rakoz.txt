How much BTC could one mine in 3 months in 2011 with an athlonii x4 640 and GTX 460? Like roughly? Because at the time I was told I was already late and that it would cost me more in electricity than what the coin was worth. (though it was $1 usd at the time) I don't remember how much I mined, but the website is gone and my address is empty. 
I wish I moved them from the pool to a wallet. Or if they're saved on my HDD I wish I secured it before reformatting. I wish I knew what I was doing when I was 21. I wish I spent a weeks pay on bitcoin and forgot about it until now. This could have ended with me discovering the notepad document with text to my secured wallet full of bitcoin that I left alone from 2011-now, but my life is shit. At least I have no idea how many bitcoin I lost, so that's slightly better than seeing the address with a fuckload of money on it and not being able to get the private key. My best guess is I left it in the mining pool and didn't send to a wallet before giving up on mining. I guess World of Warcraft was more important at the time.

I think my wallet was my account on.  
I remember seeing the site advertised on this sub and I was told to make an account there to join a group of miners. I then had to download a desktop app that did the actual mining. I remember logging into the site to check my bitcoin balance and that's where  I got the 15 and 34 digit key/passphrase. When I search the 34 digit key in Blockchain.info's search bar up top, it replies with "Oops! We couldn’t find what you are looking for." - So I'm not sure what it is then. Still trying to figure out how to turn these 2 keys into a private key and somehow add it to a new wallet. 
EDIT: The mining software is long gone after 2 computer re-formats so it would really suck if you're correct about it being stored locally.

I don't even understand how to buy at the moment, so I'll have to do some reading. But should I use my new blockchain.info account to store the coin? or download some iOS app to buy and store my coin? Just in the short amount of time I've been trying to get my stuff back I've seen bitcoin go from 7040-7100, so I'm guessing there's people making bank even buying and re-selling this throughout the day, like day-trading? Asking because I'd hate to spend money on bitcoin only to lose all my bitcoin again. If only I could take out a 100k loan and buy bitcoin with it...I only make $200 a wk though (have almost nothing to invest in the coin before it moons) but thinking of quitting my job, forgetting about money, and enjoying a short life instead. I think I already blew the one chance at success life threw at me.

does blockchain or that Ios Bread app let me? I've made a wallet account on both hoping I could at least check how much bitcoin are on the 34 digit key, but I'm seeing nothing.

Yes, I vividly remember reading all the negative articles about mining being a waste of electricity and how bitcoin was worthless, and thinking "I'm making less than $1 USD a day while I'm killing my new GTX460. I don't even know how to spend this or turn it into real money" I did the mining for about 3 months thinking it was cool that my computer was sharing a mining node with other humans doing the same, and seeing the number go up was addictive, lol. I left it running  because I took a break from WoW and wasn't using the computer for anything else, but felt guilty about the power consumption. Once I got the urge to play my favorite MMO again I stopped the mining and forgot all about bitcoin until now. If that fucking website wasn't dead I could probably have gotten my coin back since i have my login details and pin.

I was going to help out the person who best helped me recover my coin, but after reading all the replies here and using Chain.so to check the public bitcoin address I had written down, I found out the balance is empty. Anything I had mined for 3 months is gone either in the mining software or with  which is now dead. I'm guessing I had to manually send any mined coin to the 34 digit address. I feel like death, so I'm really hoping 3 months of mining equates to nothing.

I don't get how it works then. If this 34 key is the only proof of my ownership, couldn't anyone say it's theirs or add it to their wallet? I thought the website I linked above was what was storing my bitcoin, because it required a username, password, and pin. The only "proof" I have now is my 34 digit key but when I searched it on the Blockchain.info homepage it returned "Oops! We couldn’t find what you are looking for." So I'm going to try creating a wallet account there and see how it works. Trying to tie my 34 key to an account if that's what I'm supposed to do.

I honestly feel like this isn't real life and I'm stuck in a dream right now. Maybe I died in 2011 and this is the hell my conscious is stuck in. I don't want to work ever again after this. I now hate myself
