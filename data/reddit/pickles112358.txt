Most rich people are content and you are really frustrated, seriously doubt you are rich unless you make up for it with serious sexual frustration.

No pattern always works, not even in other markets. They can help you make decisions though
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:20:23
Why do you think it isn't? We've reached an ATH on market cap and even with this dip we are still higher than ever.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:08:47
Well yeah you sell when its going up and buy when its going down, thats how you daytrade. For the past 3 days we have seen several 10% changes within less than an hour, thats bread and butter for traders
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:06:10
There are infinite amount of historical patterns that forecast increase or decrease in price and you just found one. Also, take a look at the double top at the chart

You did not mention that friends now know how much coins you gave other friends and the fact that you gave other people your coins. Yes, in a state of network congestion batching is good but i see no use for it in a healthy network. In other words i consider it a band aid for the current situation
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:36:39
I would love to hear your argument of why you think s2x is bad?

Bots dont have an agenda, they just trade

@_date: 2018-01-18 15:19:16
You shouldnt invest or trade tbh. If you have done even a bit of reading you would know that you shouldnt invest more than you can lose and you should buy when its low. Personally, i do think btc will pass 20k this year but please man, educate yourself or get someone to manage your money
@_date: 2019-07-19 11:20:38
What do you mean against?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:28:14
Your comment basically means that anyone who think the price will go down further is a retard. Well joke is on you because the price dropped since your comment.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:23:38
Consider the fact that big players have bots that were programmed by teams of developers to take profits from arb opportunities. In other words, you are directly competing with big boys, which is usually not a smart thing to do.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:31:18
Definetly not worth it for any hashing algo. What you could do is get new GPU to replace them since rest of your spec is good enough for a mining rig. Be careful not to go over power limits though.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:00:20
Just keep the latest drivers and latest version of the miner. Before it there used to be a difference of about 5% but both AMD and Nvidia started targeting mining performance specifically (about 6 months ago)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:47:35
I don't think this is a good time to start. You still might get your initial investment but it depends when.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:13:53
I don't think you understand how market works.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:56:15
Yeah, you are confusing crash with a dip.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:15:21
I wasn't talking about mining. I was talking about people with large supplies of BTC with an agenda to make BCH the new bitcoin. It just so happens that they are miners.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:18:42
Well, they weren't wrong. It was 20k a few days ago.
@_date: 2018-09-11 23:39:00
Not every altcoin is centralized and premined. Look at Monero for example. I understand that people are agitated because of the bear market but this kind of negativity will get us nowhere
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:45:35
We now take satisfaction from other people losing their money?
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:56:22
And then it fell 80%. The XRP bull run is going on for a while now, and a general rule of thumb would be not to invest at an ATH. I'm not saying it won't go higher, I'm saying there is a higher chance of profit if people wait for a correction.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:17:08
The walls could be market makers.

Murder for fun isnt unethical
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:21:20
Well, you must have also heard to invest only the amount you are ready to lose
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:18
You make it seem like bitcoin is the bus. But in your analogy, blocksize is the bus and bitcoin is the company and we are it's shareholders. So yeah, it's not going well
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:54:01
Actually, your mother knowing about btc is a bad sign. The hype is always a sign of a bubble. That doesn't mean it won't go up again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:12:40
I'm sorry but crypto markets are so volatile that they are not predictable by any kind of learning algorithm. There are no fundamentals beneath it, the only think you can use in your data set is volume and price change which is not nearly enough to estimate future movements.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:07:06
All the hype is a sure sign of a bubble. When it will pop and how it will pop, that's another story. My guess is that it will continue to rise in the upcoming months just be sure to have an exit strategy.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:38:56
Well they also create opportunities for people to enter the space at lower price, which enables broader usage, driving the price further later on. On the other hand longing causes fiat/btc inflation which is would mean that people holding fiat are losing money. What im trying to say is that there are no good or bad guys (except manipulators), you just want to see your personal welth grow, which is understandable
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:10:45
Yes you are right that BTC is far more profitable to mine right now but I think Ver and Bitmain are in it for the long term influence over development. If they manage to make BCH more popular, they can change the fees on the go since they are in charge of development. Just to be clear, I'm not anywhere near sure this is going to happen but BCH pumps in the past few months are scary, it does show that someone is heavily invested in pumping it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:04:18
I actually think the opposite is going to happen. I think miners are gonna exchange their btc for bch. I think people who wanted to convert their bch to btc have already done it though USD pairs.
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:12:09
Its not so much more. Its peer-to-peer decentralized currency which happens to be ideal for buying drugs which should be legal anyway
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:02:57
Thats not a negative stereotype. Peer to peer currency is the main use-case of bitcoin, if it is used for buying drugs it just proves its good at its purpose
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:26:10
Margin is just borrowing money, nothing else. Its like saying why do people take credits
@_date: 2018-05-08 23:09:59
Shorting is usually refered to lending it and then selling it opposed to just selling an asset that you already own
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:15:33
Ok so its not about proof after all? If you are talking about losing your money the LN nodes can refuse to validate your transactions and bitcoin mainnet can undergo a 51 attack, and after all that you will usually need to convert it to fiat to spend it.
So its not your money as well since someone can take it by your definition.
There are many advantages of bitcoin but you are focusing on completely wrong ones. For general usage, *currently* fiat is by far the best choice and if anyone does not belive it is, he is delusional
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:55:39
And the amount on LN is also not "really" your money. Not only that but its also not "really" money and then when you transfer it to main chain its also not "really" money, so yeah, anyone can cherry-pick their arguments against anything to make it look bad.   
The truth is that each one has its use cases and there is no single best solution to cover them all.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:02:02
Are you saying that there are not numerous proofs that money in the bank is not yours? Because there are.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:03:46
Because it can only be bought with crypto
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:32:18
Have you heard of credit or debit cards?
@_date: 2019-08-01 09:28:24
Are you saying bitcoin wont rise ever again? Because it has crashed several times in the last almost 10 years
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:33:40
Well, the same reason bitcoin had a second run, and a third run, and so on...
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:49:02
Or maybe they do but don't think the same way as you do? I have a lot of money in crypto but I have more money in stocks. Anyone who thinks blockchain scalability isn't a huge problem knows nothing about blockchains. I think it will be "solved" some day but we still cannot predict when and if.
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:41:20
By that time bitcoin will be obsolete though
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:38:29
Well, they werent wrong
@_date: 2019-04-24 00:28:26
Im replying to a comment talking about space gold exploitation, maybe you are not aware but that is not what we are currently doing. Not a single person knows with certainty about events in the next decade so yeah, no one has a crystal ball. We can only look at the present data and roughly estimate likeliness of some event happening
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:46:39
Thats like saying 10 grams weigh more than 1 kilo. The number doesnt mean much if the units differ
@_date: 2019-04-23 08:40:46
We are talking hundreds of years in the future. Not only it can be replaced by another crypto but it will also have to go through quantum computing and breaking of private keys. Not to mention that any tech becomes obsolete after some time
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:13:08
Id certanly make first a purchase before january but id say split your buys by month or two after that (dont enter all at once)
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:20:21
Dont get scammed please
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:03:59
Actual coin most miners want is definitely not bitcoin. Maybe ether, but definitely not bitcoin, let alone 90%
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:18:08
The statement refers to markets, you are applying it to literally anything that exists so kinda missing the point
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:41:57
That is like saying that a sample of 1 and 10 people for research purposes are the same, which is not true
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:25:50
You mentioned that you cannot abuse the bitmain bug. I dont think thats true. Yes, valid nonces are random like you said but there is a range that is not searched through properly (bitmain bug). What that means is that thousands of people are searching for that needle (or needles actually), with different people checking spaces other people have already checked, reducing efficiency. However, if you would know there is an area where no-one is searching, it would mean that on average you would have a higher find rate. Please do correct me if i am wrong!
In any case, amazing read and amazing work!
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:12:07
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:50:57
Not in crypto it's not. It's actually exactly what you should do
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:09:40
This is factually wrong. You can look at distribution of mining power on bitcoin vs ethereum and you will see way more centralisation on bitcoin. Not to mention that pretty much all hardware comes from the same company.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:35:15
Have you ever heard of buying low and selling high?
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:30:45
So because you are bad at trading other people shouldn't do it?
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:02:09
Yeah, no. “API” bots is a sure sign of telling how clueless about everthing you really are.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:56:53
Holding on to your emotions like this is bad if you want to trade but then again, trading is bad for people who don't have any experience. So it's probably true that most people shouldn't sell, and instead HODL until they reach their desired price
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:28:52
Thanks for the insight! I understand what you are trying to say but if there are many different pools and thousands of miners in each, it could be likely that these different pools are brodcasting some same solution spaces to their miners. For example, trying the most valued transactions first, modifying all bits with those transactions and then moving on to a new set if solution is not found.
Im not sure how pools pick the work for their miners and how often that work overlaps over different pools but on second tought with block rewards being way higher than tx fees pools can pretty much pick totally random set on transactions for roughly the same award, so yeah you are right!
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:24:59
Thank me when you learn to trade
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:09:18
I think more people are overly optimistic than overly pessimistic here.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:32:07
Thats not true. Stop order can be both sell or buy order. Stop order triggers a limit order once the stop amount is reached.
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:15:04
Wow, I didn't expect I'd see this here. I agree with absolutely everything!
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:29:08
Yeah, that doesn't mean anything.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:35:54
Correct on both points. However, people here are throwing the word manipulation way too lighty, price movements are mostly because people are trading. Also, its manipulation only if price drops, otherwise you will get downvoted
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:46:40
Well, considering his bet proposal, he believes it has under 1% chance to reach 280k. Thats not very optimistic imo
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:22:59
For example, any type of advancements in scaling is a good indicator of growth, be it on chain or off chain scaling. There are also numerous other indicators not explicitly related to tech itself like adoption and media hype.
Past performance taken by itself is an awful indicator not even the most uneducated investors would touch.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:39:27
Not only that it is a terrible indicator its also far from a best indicator. There actually are good indicators especially if you follow the tech but past performance gives you absolutely zero insight about future movements
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:00:40
If something is scarce it doesnt mean it is sound money. Something with limited availability can both rise and fall in value depending on the usage. For example, if we start developing all conductive materials out of gold, gold price will rise rapidly. So, somethig being stable in value does indeed depend on usage as well. Also, limited availability is not much different from 1% inflation and bitcoin has inflation of about 4%
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:32:48
You are just on the wrong sub. This is not a tech-related sub. Most people here have no clue what blockchain even is, let alone what it can do
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:34:42
Well since becoming famous he is trying to please peple following him, and since we know what type of people follow him he does have strong and firm political oppinions. Not that there is anything wrong with that but I enjoyed him more when he was less famous, nowdays feels like hes just running around in circles
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:29:12
Dealing with a bank i transparent as well. There are terms and agreements. Open sourcing something doesnt mean anything for decentralization. There is still a single entity in charge of forther code developement and maintenance. Also, hubs can be centralized and your payments actually go through them, meaning your money passes through other parties, so ita not peer-to-peer like bitcoin is
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:58:33
Good analogy, but this checking accout, like any other, is in control of a single entity. So unlike bitcoin it is not centralized but like banks we trust our money to it
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:13:47
Yet people are trying to add 3rd parties like LN, and people on this sub acrually welcome such things. Confusing
