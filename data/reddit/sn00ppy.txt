It seems pretty reasonable dividing whatever you have to invest in smaller parts and make purchases every day until you have invested all. 
If the price goes down, you buy a little bit more that day, if it goes up, you buy a little less.

start panicing just in case

I actually ended up automating just that, but instead of 10% it calculates how much exactly to buy or sell, it depends on how drastically the price moved.

that's because you don't sell when the dip that you bought gets profitable, if you did, you would end up buying more for cheaper price every next dip ;P

"vodka coin" seems more reasonable, trustful and it would gain mass adoption very fast

Well then get your shit together, get it all together and put it in a back pack, all your shit, so it's together...
And if you gotta take it some where, take it somewhere, you know, take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in the shit museum. I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together...
Get your shit together!
