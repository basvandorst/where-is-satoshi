Do you have your account setup that way? I have a Navy Federal account and have a slider that I can hit to give me more apr as long as I keep 10k in the account and once it dips Bellow tenk I have to manually set that off. Otherwise I get charged like 4$. It can be useful. I can make like 20 extra bucks a month if I keep it above ten k.

That story probably also happened on 4chan. There's a bunch of crazy storries on there. I would assume 95% of them are bullshit but there are some suspect ones where people upload images too. Like when a guy broke into an abandon. House and found a dead guy in a recliner that had probably been dead for a better part of a year. They uploaded photos and it seemed hard to fake. But most of the storries I've seen have been either comedy gold. Wierd as shit crazy stuff. Or just down right creepy

Well that's debatable now that Honda's putting CVT transmissions in their cars. They're ridding their good name on the hopes that people don't notice their transmissions failing. Ford at least scaled back all the shit they make and only focus on making what they're actually good at. Trucks and suvs with actual transmissions. Honda's motorcycles are still good though. And they're manual transmissions cars are still good.

Harley Davidson Lost and gained major market value between its highest years in 2006 ish and rebounding again back in 2014.

I've owed money to the IRS. Trust me kids they will make your life a living hell. And they'll get it. It doesn't matter what you do if they think you owe them money. And you actually do owe them money, trust me you're fucked. You're going to pay up. Either with time behind bars. Or with cash. And if it's a large sum of money they'll send an investigator at you to build a case. And the thing about the federal government. They won't arrest you until they have enough evidence to completely fuck you. It won't be a street detective and it might take years. But they'll get you. Unless you just leave the country.

No I do that. But it still isn't full proof. You can be blindsided at any time. Anyway we've gotten off topic. The discussion was about the possiblity of a 90% drop and rebound. Which is highly unlikely but possible. Because shit happens.

No you're right. They pay for a legit substation and the power company gives them a better deal on there power. I mean it's still a fuckload of money but it's also a cheaper solution if you're seriously using power.

The USA has actually been raising interest rates which is a sign that our economy is doing okay. In like 1988 our interest rate was sky fucking high. To get a home it wasn't unheard of to pay 14% interest rates. This is actually a sign that your country is doing really well. It means the banks are flourishing people have good paying jobs to pay for those expensive interest rates. And so on.well after the recession hit our interest rates crashed. It was used as a saftey net. If you have a high interest rate and you into reccesion, lowering interest rates can be used as a band aid. That's what the USA and the entire world did. Now the USA is starting to raise interest rates again and hopefully we can get a few percent higher before the next crash. Other countries on the other hand are still at 0% they're fucked big time if another one hits.

You're assuming they're going to space to mine gold. I could probably argue with you about how mining gold is the not even on the top five list of metals theyd be after but I'm just not going to. There's rare Earth metals worth so much that it would take literally a hundred years of constant mining on Earth if they found a massive deposit. to drive there price down to gold level prices. If you're going to space to mine gold you're fucking retarded.
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:03:55
No I'm saying that to bring Fiat currency to it's former glory would take a another WW1. The reason the US got so wealthy by and large happened because the wealth of France, britan, Russia, and even Germany went to the USA during the war. Imagine centuries of wealth stock pileing, and then it all goes to the USA for the war effort. At the start of the war britan was paying for it's war with gold mostly, and almost all of it went to the US. By the end, they we're taking loans out with US. One of the reasons the USA and I say one because there were way more than one but, a big reason the US sided with Britain and France was because those countries owed the US a fuck load of money. In the begining and for 90% of WW1 the US profited A lot from that war. Mostly because we didn't fight in it until years after it started. And then twenty years later the whole thing started over. however WW2 wasn't as profitable for the US. The second WW did however cement the USA as an industrial power house for the next 45 years.

To say gold has no utility is wrong. It's used in electronics heavily. Something like 35% of the gold pulled from the ground is used in electronics. Another 35% for jewelry. More is used in aerospace to reflect infrared radiation. It's used in medicine still today. Mostly for old people but it's still used. That's all I can think now. It's a useful metal. Same with other way way way more expensive rare Earth metals. There's rare Earth metals that. Cost so much it puts bit coin to absolute shame. Of course it's hard to get your hands on them however.

We're not talking about spreading democracy. We're talking about destroying a target. The target being Bitcoin. Give the military two or so years to plan an attack on the network and they'll figure out a way to take it down. Again I don't think it'll ever happen but Its possible. Not probable but possible.

No it didn't it it destroyed the Iraqi army in like a week and a half. It works well against conventional targets where there is a target.
@_date: 2019-10-08 12:40:52
Yes it would. And I think if it did come to that which I don't think it will but if it did they could end bitcoin pretty fast. I say this because I know how the military plans if they have the time. They'll plan something like this for a year before they implement the attack and then once it would happen it would be shock and awe. That's how the military does strike packages. Launch 4000 tomohawks get them to a pre planed way point have them go in circles for an hour until all the missiles get to there way point then drop them all at the same time. They attack like this with everything and there's no reason to think a Bitcoin attack would be any different.... With that said I don't think the military would ever utilize their hackers like this. Because in general the military doesn't give a shit about bitcoin. And why should they.
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:40:02
I'm not incorrect though in my explanation. You're just attacking small bits. Higher interest rates means a better economy. Lower means worse it's basically what I explained. The USA has the highest. How is that wrong. Regardless if they're cutting or raising them the US is still better off than most.
