0.13 BTC is worth its own post here? Makes you wonder the demographic of this sub ...

Just like the judge we believe there’s more to this than what you have edited in. Going to freeross.org might give us the same biased view as what you are preaching, I rather do my **own research** instead.

*This article is an exercise in imagination based on the assumption that Apple would release an iPhone with an integrated Bitcoin wallet as early as Fall 2020. This assumption is not based on any insider information at Apple or any of the other mentioned companies.
The probability of this scenario playing out is highly unlikely and thus the article mainly serves as a starting point for a discussion on how the Bitcoin ecosystem needs to develop to achieve broad consumer adoption.*
