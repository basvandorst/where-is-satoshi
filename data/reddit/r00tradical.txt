How about stop misleading these people, the greed in this sub amazing.

You're too late. I've bought them very early for fun and haven't bought them again in 5 years, so yeah I have a huge profit and I'm riding this crazy roller-coaster out.
The price is rising because it is rising, it's blowing itself up and the collapse will be serious, the problem is that we don't know when. Bitcoin needs its daily new victims, when people stop buying it will all crumble down.

More useful idiots to keep the bubble alive.

Yeah I've been using coins for a long time and it's depressing what it's turning into.

I have coins but I'm not delusional, it's a ponzi scheme. There's very little change that Bitcoin will ever be used as a currency.

So when was the last time you paid your groceries with bitcoin? Or your car payment?

Sure a single crypto currency will be in our future, but it ain't going to be Bitcoin, the central banks will never let this happen.
The planet is getting worse mate, and Bitcoin [ain't helping.] (
