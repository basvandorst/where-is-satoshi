This bubble will pop so hard. Btc is ruining it for the whole cryptoscene... Downvote me to hell but its the truth

Hahaha this is hilarious. Btc and 3/4 of its community are so childish. Like it or not but botcoins days are counted dude. No one wants a fkin 3 day wait for a tx and a fee of 30$ -&gt; total useless. Oooh yeah store of value right haha.
Go on boys downvote me or delete my post. Imagine people would read the truth.

So if you have your coins on a ledger in cold storage you dont have to worry about this?

0% i think. Such great fundamentals, lightning fast network and almost free tx's

I'm talking about bitcoin and not you. So technically the forks are btcs forks right? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:09:19
Yeah ignore the truth and keep your eyes shut for the truth

You btc and your 25 forks are fucking up and making crypto ridiculous. Go downvote me or delete my post. Its the cold hard truth

Downvote me to hell but bitcoin is fucking up this market so bad. Extremely overvalued, no future plans or development. A community always in fight. And this coin have to represent us to the outer world.   Feels sad for you guys. One day btc will collapse like a house of cards when people start to realize the tech (read 0) behind btc

Tell me why people should use bitcoin or why invest in it then? What has btc that eth doesnt? Serious answer wanted
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:21:17
Yeah maybe its an original idea and i "respect" the idea but seriously, btc is running out of gas technological way. Commodore 64 was also killed one day. First by 3.86 4.86 windows apple... And this time will come to for btc. Lets see then whis diaper will be dirty
