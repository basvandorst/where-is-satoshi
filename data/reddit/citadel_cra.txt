I agree with OP in their posting of this article here. It highlights a very good rebuttal to persons who use the "illegal activities" argument when denouncing Bitcoins.

Long termers grab the cheap coins for the purpose of holding as an investment. While these coins aren't being traded they are effectively removed from the market, thereby diminishing available supply. Even if demand stays the same the supply will not and prices rise. 
Once the price reaches a specific point some investors will naturally liquidate some of their holdings. This will introduce new supply as demand flags dropping the price.

From your edit would one be forced to change employers if they didn't want to participate in that restructuring tribute?

Better bail out the banks again, I'm sure some of the tax payers are guilty.
