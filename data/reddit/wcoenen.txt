That roughly corresponds to 30 satoshi/byte if I'm not mistaken. You can follow the mempool backlog for various fee thresholds on this site I recently built:

I built a [mempool graph]( last week because I wasn't sure whether I should worry.
This graph does show that at the 10 satoshi/byte level (= your 0.0001 BTC/kB), sometimes there is a multi-megabyte backlog and you won't get in the next block. Other times there is no backlog and it's fine. It varies.

I don't think it is fair to make fun of Bloomberg's reporter here. BitPay's Sonny Singh told him that the bitcoin halving is "like a stock split" right before this. To me, *that* was the part that didn't make sense.

Yes, and to be of any use in AML, the certificate used by the wallet would need to be tied to your real identity. I assume they are referring to something like an [SMIME certificate]( 
However, I have never heard of a bank or even a bitcoin exchange demanding that their customers prove their identity with an SMIME certificate signature. That's why the quoted AML use case seems farfetched to me.

I have built something similar here:

Mempool size is meaningless unless it is specified which fee/byte minimum is being enforced by the node. I set this graph up so that you can chose between a few different tresholds:

I see a lot of knee-jerk reactions here. Has anyone actually read [BIP75]( Given that financial institutions usually don't identify their customers by their public key, I don't see how this enhancement would have any effect on AML practices.

130 MW on 1 hectare equals 13 kilowatt per square meter.  13  kilowatt is more continuous heat production than that of an electric water boiler for a medium household running full blast.

This was posted 2 days after pirateat40 announced that he was "closing" BTCST, when some people still believed that they were going to be paid. The poster was just referring to the fact that the money was gone. This was obvious from context when it was posted.

To determine whether there is spare capacity, it might be more useful to look at [the backlog]( of transactions paying a chosen minimum fee per byte.
As long as the backlog is below 1MB, it can be cleared in one block. If not, there will be confirmation delays.

Merchants need to include the transaction costs in their prices somehow, so you effectively pay a 2% surcharge on everything in order to get that 2% "cashback".

Did the demo include path-finding between random nodes on a simulated network, or is this just about payments going back and forth on a channel between two nodes?
@_date: 2016-07-20 07:51:46
The main idea of Lightning is that payments are routed over pre-existing channels between nodes, so that actual bitcoin transactions on the blockchain can be avoided. Creating a new channel each time that you need to pay someone would defeat the purpose, as setting up channels also involves transactions; so you must use pre-existing ones.
Now imagine a network where each link is a channel between nodes, and these links are constantly being removed (when channels are closed or expire) and added (when new channels are set up).  The goal is to find a pre-existing route over this dynamic network from your own lightning node to the one you are trying to send a payment to. Finding this route will take some time and resources, and any work you do ahead of time may become invalidated by changes in the network topology.
