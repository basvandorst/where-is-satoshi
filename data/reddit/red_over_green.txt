Ron Swanson from Parks and Rec would be proud of that comment.

Buffet, Gates, and Munger know that Bitcoin is a threat to their other investments in their portfolios.  Once institutional investing becomes common it will be hard for Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 companies to grow at their current levels due to a decline in volume.  People will still buy stocks, but at an opportunity cost to crypto.

This arrogant attitude will be Bitcoin’s demise.  Bitcoin’s biggest fears will be realized when x, y, and z altcoins start becoming more mainstream and the massive rotation of value transfers out Bitcoin.  
Smart money isn’t loyal.

Excellent point.

Rakeman's Creed
This is my rake, there are many like it but this one is mine.
My rake is my best friend, it is my life.
I must master it like I must master my life.
Without me my rake is useless, without my rake I am useless.

And you say that as fact, explain why.  I like and respect Bitcoin, but this elitist mentality gets a little annoying.  Just don’t act surprised one day when an altcoin becomes a household name.

How will this solve the homeless problem once and for all if it will also incentivize more people to become or remain homeless?
Also, what apartment complex owner / manager wants to house the homeless?  Have you ever spent time at a homeless shelter?  You'll walk away less sympathetic.  All of the volunteers donating their time, money, and resources and a majority of the homeless can't even pitch in on simple tasks.
If anyone here has ever visited the beautiful city of Austin, Texas... drive by the homeless shelter and look at all the vagrants sitting and lying around with tons of paper garbage littering their presence with empty trash cans steps away.  They lack basic initiative, pride, and grit.
If you're going to donate, do so for people who are appreciative.

Amazon has a history of selling Nano ledgers as new, but time and again the seal is broken, thus potentially compromised or defective.  
I’ve experienced similar purchases that I’ve made through Amazon on a ‘new item’ that is most likely a return from someone else and repackaged.  
Contacting Amazon does two things: notifies them of fraudulent sellers, or at the very least let’s them know that one of their customers is dissatisfied with Amazon’s service.  
You said there’s nothing wrong. Explain.

You're blaming Reagan for the homeless problem? lol  BTW, you didn't show that housing them is cheaper just because you linked some studies, because any organization can cherry pick stats and guide their conclusion.  I bet your next liberal thesis will be that our current welfare system is also cheaper, and fiscally and morally successful, after all, RAND has helped shaped that policy as well in the 60s.  Progress? 
The Personal Responsibility argument has historical proof, even YOU are a product of it.  It's called survival and it exists in third world to first world countries.  I support helping the incapable homeless, but they are not the majority that are capable and are in their predicament because of self-inflicted abuses and poor life choices.  There's usually a story behind every capable homeless person and why they've been abandoned by society, their former employers, and even their own family members.  I'm sure they were given ample opportunities and chances to change their behavior, but did not.  There are also so many examples of people born into poverty that took advantage of public schooling and live a respectable life and contribute to society.  They had initiative, pride, and grit... a human resource that is in abundance if you have the motivation to look for it.
You're being an enabler to a social problem and your solution has long-term negative effects, but hey, let's blame Reagan.

Please line item the $100k expense of 'processing them in and out of jail'.  I find this stat difficult to trust.

So you are absolutely positive that the box that packages the ledger does not have an Anti-Tampering seal, basically tamperproof tape?

Also contact Amazon, because this seems to be happening more frequently.

How did you buy yours?  Just curious.
