Yeah? Everyone thinks everything?  Do you bother to read any of these ongoing issues or just allow yourself to get overwhelmed and dismiss concerns?

Tf? Phone and water? Weak attempt at proving a half-founded counter point. Knock off dollar store brands are there for a reason; loop holes don't prove validity but definitely contributes to poor business practice.

You should also remove the suggestion of Kraken -- it's a horrible exchange with terrible CS.

Please be careful following this guide -- there is a fair bit of misguided advice in it.
Personally, anything above .50-.75 BTC should be moved to a hardware wallet unless you feel comfortable losing $4,000.

[Ledger]( is great. 
You could purchase from Coinbase if you do not mind fees.  Keep in mind Coinbase will charge roughly ~$8.00 if you transfer BTC anywhere; plan accordingly to reduce the amount of transfer and associated fees.

There is a vast difference between a brand (Desani, Fiji, Aquafina) and the product (Water).  What you are proposing is that Bitcoin Cash is totally justified using the Bitcoin name.  In your scenario, that would be the same as Aquafina taking the Fiji brand, using their name, logo, packaging etc. but putting the Aquafina product in it and saying 'It's all the same anyways'.  No, it's vastly different and to think it's the same is alarming.
There's an emotional value in a brand, people buy Bitcoin because they are familiar with it.  Bitcoin Cash is hijacking that emotional leverage and swapping out the product hoping the consumer does not notice.  Is this illegal? It's treading a thin line.  Is this immoral? Absolutely. 
Edit: Got it - you're not interested in discussion.

This whole guide feels weird -- suggesting Kraken to new buyers?  Has he researched the exchange in the last month?  Anyone who tries to correct them gets an artificial marketing vibe sort of reply.

There's no use in responding to them; they're clearly okay with the deception and think it's perfectly acceptable.
