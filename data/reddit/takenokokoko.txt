We were &gt;$600 a couple weeks ago, so it's kind of difficult to make the case that the market is flat. Just as you describe, ~3600 coins are hitting the market each day and we slowly bleed down as demand doesn't keep pace with the sell pressure.

I think you're missing the point. bitcoin is cheap because it's decentralized; there are no brick and mortar stores, staff, support, etc.
western union offers all the above, and that's the reason for the premium on fees. they already have their own network for remittance, and they certainly wouldn't want to decentralize it.

Perhaps the next generation of crypto currencies could be based off clicks? One mouse click will net your "mining software" 1 coin. Everyone around the world can download the software and click their mouse button as many times as they want for as many coins as they can manage. 
Of course, over time, there would be "difficulty adjustments" and after 5 years, 1 mouse click is only worth 1/1,000 of a coin, perhaps. You'd go to a store and ask how much a 6 pack of beer costs. "That will be 10,000 clicks," Burl Ives will tell you from behind the counter.

I never said that I believe the price will plummet near term, I actually think the hype will bring it up over $1000 again within the next few months. All I'm saying is that the bitcoin community is failing to present any legitimate points to the general public as to why they need bitcoin.

think of an airline. they might have a perfect safety record for 10 years, but then one day, one of their competitors has a horrific crash. safety record of this company be damned, there will be a lack of comsumer confidence and people will elect to drive or take trains to their destinations for a few weeks/months. that's what's happening.

credit cards, banks, and paypal are all for profit businesses, not charity. people pay fees for the services that they provide, such as customer support, security, and dispute resolutions. Bitcoin offers none of these, which is causing a few people to wake up and realize *why* they pay these fees. it's not just so for profit companies make "gobs of money". people use these vendors for the service and peace of mind that they provide.
All of these "wouldn't it be great" scenarios are already true for me. I pay my mortgage each month with no fees, and having my paycheck deposited into my bank account each month also carries no fees, so I don't know what you're talking about there

it's come a long way since the days when I had to use the red moneygram phone at CVS to buy coins. A lot of people expect to walk into Wal Mart and buy them off the shelf; of course it's not going to be that easy. It takes all of 10 minutes to open an account with Coinbase. How long does it take to open a traditional brokerage account? It's got room to improve, but once you know what you're doing, getting bitcoin really isn't so difficult anymore.

prices will likely go down further at some point after you buy. if you cant handle that, then you're gonna have a bad time. bitcoin is about fun. so what you do is buy and don't fret about it, look back a few months or years later and hopefully achieve profits. expect quick profits = gonna have a bad time.

Controlled inflation is not a problem.

"you're still an early adopter" is one of the sales pitches that the *true* early adopters give, in order to draw others in and allow them to continue their early retirement,

most retailers are happy to pay the processing fees associated with credit cards because they facilitate easier and faster payment by consumers, which, as you allude to, does to some degree cause consumers to spend more than they would ordinarily with cash. 
so it's a symbiotic relationship: consumers have access to buy the things they want/need on the spot, and retailers rake in more sales/profit. I think bitcoiners would be surprised to find that retailers, in a bitcoin economy, in most cases would not lower prices, because revenues would lower if consumers did not have easy access to credit. higher sales cover margins and again, there is a valid reason why stores are willing to pay the cc processing fee.
I understand you want to live in a world where consumers buy only the very essentials and no frills, but you need to understand: this is not human nature. people want access to credit and rewards. and as I pointed out earlier, if you use your credit card responsbibly and pay off your balances each month, you net benefit from the rewards programs. much of this is paid by the intereste collected on card holder balances, but those who pay those balances willingly select to utilize the credit and enter into that agreement.
people, when given the choice, will choose credit cards over bitcoin pretty much every time. and retailers, likewise, unless they're tiny "mom and pop" operations, are happy with that arrangement.

Valid point, but in my experience speaking and interacting with Japanese on a daily basis, they don't seem concerned at all.

You're right, there really is no point. There are perhaps some valid uses for bitcoin (ie. black market transactions) but I really can't see people desiring to use bitcoins for transactions with legitimate companies due to the lack of consumer protections and any kind of reward system (credit cards). Bitcoins are a speculation instrument mostly, at least for now.

Many bitcoiners have a strong victim mentality and like to believe the single entity of "the media" is out to get them and their digital currency hobby. Personally, I don't recall anyone claiming that bitcoin was dead and finished, although a few writers did seem to think MtGox's implosion could be the start of the end. Still, it's too early to declare if they're wrong or not.
Overwhelmingly, most articles I read about bitcoin are positive, or at least thought provoking.

A fair point, but I think it would be more appropriate to pair all the social networking platforms into one container, which would include entries such as instagram, facebook, myspace, and before that, friendster. If you look at the big picture, then you'll see it took several years until the public was ready and a site like facebook was able and poised to take on millions of users.
Also, as I've posted before, those making the comparison with reward granting credit cards are missing the point. If bitcoin is to succeed, the very fact that it is a depreciating asset class will assure that it brings returns greater than 1 or 2 percent per year, which would beat credit cards. Bitcoin is primarily an investment, and also has the added feature that it can be spent easily, unlike precious metals.

It may not have peaked yet, but we're still deflating from the last bubble and prices could go a lot lower before they head up again. the recent problems with the protocol and exchanges are likely to leave investor cautious for a few months at least. There's also the chance for increased regulation from governments in 2014, which will likely put down pressure on the price.
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:57:15
It's also interesting, though not necessarily relevant, that the dot com bubble was ~6 years in the making, from the early tech stocks of '94 until the crash in 2000. Bitcoin is now on year 5, so if the timeline holds true, 2015 could be huge... until it pops, of course.

@_date: 2014-01-19 03:17:09
It's going to be a long time before bitcoin can "stabilize" relative to government issued currencies. It's a deflationary currency, so the more people who enter the market, the higher it will go. There is no sign that the public, overall, is losing interest, so it is likely that we will keep going up, though it could take several months for another speculative boom to occur.

Well, if it's not showing up in the blockchain, then it means they never actually sent it, so they can probably credit it back to your account, but it could take a few days for a response on the ticket.

In 2013, I would have said that 'dollar cost savings'  was an effective strategy for bitcoin investing, but now I'm feeling like the bitcoin bubble has truly burst this time. 
ie. not the bubble cycle, but the five year bitcoin bubble. The bounce off of $380 was almost non-existent, which indicates that it will not hold for much longer. Once we hit ~$260, it's going to be a Chinese fire drill as everyone makes a mad dash for the exits.

we already have the "killer app". it's the low barrier of entry into trading and investing for people who have never gone through the steps of opening brokerage accounts. within a couple hours, you can be set up and trading on exchanges from the comfort of your home PC. the vast majority of btc users are interested in making money on investing and have never traded assets before now.

no kidding. if governments wanted to bring it down, they'd just regulate it and ban payment processors. credit companies probably could care less at the moment. in bitcoin fantasyland, we're at war with the world elites, i guess it stems from some juvenile desire to feel like a jason bourne -type behind the keyboard in a hollywood action movie.

2. people don't want to pay for music on the radio

bitcoin is an answer to a problem people don't have. bitcoin still has room to grow, but not for the reasons above.

credit cards are an archaic payment system that's easy prey to fraud; all that's needed to replicate a card is the number, name, exp date, and cvv code. so it can be argued that both target and credit cards are to blame.
bitcoin likewise can take some fault in the mtgox heist. in other words, bitcoin's stength is also a major weakness. transactions are difficult to track, and what is stoppimg employees from an exchange who have access to wallets from transferring balances to a hidden address? "oops, we've been hacked." it's too easy.

so you honestly think bitcoin will be replacing credit cards in the future, thereby enabling merchants to start passing on savings to customers? I get it that bitcoin can be good for merchants, but nobody is making a reasonable case of why consumers would ditch their cards.
You think they would over the *promise* of discounts in the future? People in general don't think long term like that. Besides, many already receive 3% cash back or more from their credit cards. Hell, I get 6% back for grocery shopping! Why would they ditch the consumer protections, etc? 
It doesn't make sense.

it's really not surprising that people are losing interest with bitcoin in general. the past few weeks have actually been quite exciting... from a news standpoint. lots of things happening and most of them good. the price however... not so much. it gets pumped, and then slowly bleeds back down again. the "bubble cycle" (if you want  to believe in that kind of thing) seems to be breaking, and 2014 has probably been the most boring year on record so far for the market.

Nothing wrong with your trading method per se, but why not use an actual exchange? The problem I see with Coinbase is, each time you make a trade back and forth to your bank account, it creates an easily traceable audit record for the IRS and could potentially arouse suspicion with the bank. I'd recommend another platform such as BTC-E or likewise.
I'd buy the coins from Coinbase and then transfer them elsewhere for trading.

supply and demand, baby. Interest in bitcoin keeps growing and supply is contricted. furthermore, within a year, block rewards will likely be cut in half. Merchant adoption is exploding, so it's very likely that we'll see valuations of at least 10k/coin in 2 or 3 years, perhaps much more.

Yeah, I get you, but I think the problem is that they no longer have enough bitcoins, cash, or likely both on hand to pay out account holders (due to either incompetence or downright fraud, and partially due to account seized by US gov). This is why they're dragging their feet and buying time, likely to continue collecting fees and deposits, which still likely won't save them. Nothing short of a "bail out" is going to remedy this.

That was my original point: Western countries largely helped develop Africa and bring the continent to the modern world, rather than harm and "exploit" like others have claimed. Parts of Africa were still using shell money until the early 20th century, for chrissake.

Sorry dude, I don't think there's much you can do here. It's probably time to seek closure on the situation.

those fees go into providing services for paypal users. ever wonder why an eBay for bitcoin is failing to takeoff? it's because buyers, acting in their own self interests (as they should be) cannot trust sellers to deliver goods once the bitcoin is sent. the incentive for fraud is huge. 
"But you can use escrow!" Yes, dumbass, but you think that will be free? I'm happy to pay 4.4% to PayPal if they help me facilitate easy transactions and connect me with sellers, which is exactly what they do.

every time we have a major drop after a rally, somewhere out there, a once delusional investor wakes up and realizes that bitcoin is no more than a speculative mania with little substance to back it up.

bitcoin enthusiasts love to hand wave this problem away by saying that drives will grow larger to accomodate. the fact is, if the ecosystem continues to grows, transactions will grow exponentially, causing the blockchain to grow to enormous sizes within the next few years. 
this will cause bitcoin to become more centralized, as there will need to be specialized disk arrays arranged to hold it... not something many people will be setting up in their homes.
recent consumer trends for storage has been going toward fast read/write speeds, not so much for larger storage. pending some kind of incredible breakthrough in nano-technology, blockchain centralization is inevitable.

a ponzi scheme misleads investors into believing that they're locked into an investment with guarantees of high returns. nobody is pretending that bitcoin speculation is a guaranteed return, most of us understand that it could go up a lot more or fall to zero. Naturally, early investors took a large risk and many have been rewarded for their persistence and faith in the protocol. 
It's fun to hold bitcoins and participate in the community, also to watch it grow and the network develop. You can actively trade them or gamble them for increased profit, and now you can even spend them in an increasing number of stores. No central force is intentiionally misleading the public, hence, no ponzi scheme.

it's a known fraudulent site. from what i see, they do pay out on bets, but they drag their feet and engage in predatory business practice in order to con people out of their money, which is then passed as "generous donations" to their shareholders. 
it's best with bitcoin to not use any third party, for anything, ever, unless you're willing to accept a complete loss.

Bitcoin is a protocol and service; the protocol is supported by thousands of nodes. It can potentially be used for other services, which may come forth in the future (much like HTTP is one service that rides on the TCP/IP protocol). This infrastructure has value, so as long as the network remains there will be value. Yeah, people may give up on it and move to something else if (as I said before) a fatal flaw is discovered and exploited.
You seem to believe bitcoin is simply a fad? Okay, that's fine, it does have some characteristics of a fad. But that's why we're speculating... very few people deny that. Beanie babies are dolls, with essentially no utility (maybe it could be used for a pillow?). Bitcoin has the potential to become a new, digitial currency used by millions and it also has the potential to support new, P2P services.

Exactly. I'm not sure how much it costs to wire money from a Japanese account to a US bank, but I'm sure once it's done you'll be lucky to walk away with any appreciable profit. In order to make it worth the time and effort, I'd suppose you would need to arbitrage quite a sum of money... but you'd have to be somewhat crazy to trust Mt Gox with those kind of funds given their reputation for horrendous customer service.

It comes down to cultural attitudes toward saving/investing. Chinese are prolific savers, more than Americans generally.

People in general understand the risk profile associated with holding cash. They know it's a good idea to not put thousands of dollars into their wallet when they go out for a walk downtown, and they know it's better to keep money in a bank rather than an envelope in their dresser. Some people do anyway, but they understand the risk.
With bitcoin, there's a persistent level of paranoia. "Are my coins safe on my computer? Safe on an exchange? Safe in my offline wallet (can I recover them properly?)" What is this heartbleed SSL bug? Does it affect me?
Computer security is a complicated field, and even experts can be surprised by the emergence of new exploits. So for that reason, holding bitcoins is higher risk than cash.

what a ridiculous notion. western nations have contributed tremendously to Africa directly via aid packages and favorable loans, as well as infrastructure development via investments. china also invests heavily in Africa and has even canceled over 10 bn in loans to African nations over the past 10 years. Africa sits on some of the richest deposits of minerals and oils in the entire world, yet until outside entrepreneurs arrived they were completely powerless to extract any to benefit themselves. 
I don't mean to sound insensitive, but african problems are caused by Africans. A major part of this is their mishandling of money, and that starts with learning how to invest and use money properly.

If your paycheck is bitcoin, and all bills, services, goods are paid by bitcoin, then it would make more sense to spend bitcoin. Until that happens, it's unlikely that it will replace government backed currencies. You're right, there really is no good reason to use it instead of cash/credit cards, aside from ideological reasons, or for shopping in niche markets where traditional payment methods are not authorized (gambling, etc). Maybe it never will become a major currency, but instead an asset that can hold value, but with greater annual returns and convenience than precious metals.
Also, perhaps one day we will all have a bitcoin address assigned to us at birth, much like a social security number in the US. This can be used to prove identity, by signing the public ledger with your key. Much less identity fraud this way. Many people first hear about bitcoin and think *currency!* but it could be much bigger than that.

This is a non issue. Likely the private keys have been destoryed, tied up in some kind of trust, or even lost. It would be against the self interests of "Nakamoto" or the other developers to cash in at all at once, but even if that did happen, the protocol will carry on, and coins would have a much lower price for some period of time. Adjusted for inflation, Rockefeller had almost a trilllion dollars, but he didn't topple countries, he helped erridicate horrible diseases and generally did good for the world.

I don't hate bitcoin, I think it's a clever payment system and the public ledger is cool, but I think it will ultimately go down in history as a niche market for hobbyists and deep web transactions. 
I can't stand the attitude of the majority of bitcoiners and the way they expect it to displace traditional payment methods, etc. So much wishful thinking around here and outright bullshit about why bitcoin is supposedly better. So much retarded logic and arguments get repeated so often that others start to believe it, sadly.

i'm in Japan too, I get the impression that this country is behind the curve on cryptocurrency; the few people here who even know what bitcoin is tend to still hold the "it's black market, used for drugs and other nefarious things" stance. I'm not surprised though, seeing as how Japanese still barely use credit cards or other payment systems. Most still carry around wads of cash everywhere. The closest thing they have to a mobile payment system is the Suica card for the subway. I don't expect a big boom from Japan anytime soon for Bitcoin interest, honestly.

If you're referring to the infamous quote from Ken Olson, he was referring to home automation by computers, so he was essentially right, but people love to misconstrue it as if he were referring to personal computers. I'd like to know who said e-mail was pointless.. it had obvious utility right from the start, but at the time it was not intended for consumer use because... personal computers did not yet exist...
By the early '90s, personal computers were becoming affordable and Internet portals such as AOL in the US were making Internet access attainable. The entire game changed and the Internet was suddenly a place anyone could enter, not just academics and government agencies. 
The comparison with bitcoin is a moot point, because from the ground up bitcoin was designed for the common man. Yet five years later, by and large, the only people using bitcoin are speculators hoping to get rich.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:45:52
there was some skepticism of the dot com boom and Internet shopping, which I think some people are confusing for the advent of the world wide web and affordable Internet portals such as AOL for consumers? When we all refer to the "Internet", I think that's what we generally have in mind. those early days could be frusterating at times (busy signals on dial up, etc) but I don't remember anyone calling it a fad. Within a couple years, almost everyone I knew had a home PC and were getting online.
Meanwhile with bitcoin, I've known about it three years now, and I still don't know anyone in real life who owns any. Not saying it will never happen, but it's a poor comparison.

the worldwide bitcoin holdings are far more weighted to the top few percentile of holders than cash, so to the contrary, bitcoin would make the poor poorer to the betterment of a few hundred ultra wealthy crypto geeks. maybe we can overcome this eventually, but given that wealth accumulation is human nature, i doubt it.
perhaps if these "born poor" learned self discipline and basics of investing, they could pull themselves out instead of perpetually waiting for some rich benifcator to come and rescue them. surely they can save $100 to invest in bitcoin, perhaps a few years from now they will be wealthy enough to become the elite in their respective homelands.

You know what, I'll amend that previous statement. I get the feeling that most people here don't own credit cards. Maybe they're too young, don't pass the credit requirements, or just don't feel like they need them. If you're one of those people, then maybe you could avoid international transaction fees by using bitcoin, if such a global economy ever develops. But in the meantime, you still need to pay exchange fees to convert from fiat to bitcoin and vice versa, so it's a moot point.

lmao... you boldly claim that bitcoin users aren't affected, but then you wrap your post up with the caveat that they're not affected just so long as they keep their coins offline in a cold wallet, which is obviously the minority of users. Contrasting this with online banking is an apples to oranges comparison.
I could easily say that fiat users aren't affected, just as long as they don't use online banking or keep their money at home in a safe or tucked into a coffee can under the bed (the majority of fiat users). 
At least if fiat users *are* affected, their money will be reimbursed. Do you think bitstamp or other online bitcoin exchanges will reimburse their users? Wouldn't count on it.

Mostly agree, but why does everyone assume that citizens of Argentina or any other country would flock to bitcoin as a hedge to their government issued currency? I mean, I know a lot about bitcoin and have followed it for a couple years, but I wouldn't trust it with all my money (as is oft repeated here, do not invest more than you're willing to lose).
Do we really believe Argentenians would be putting their money into bitcoin, where the value could potentially drop 50% or more in the matter of days? Yes, it could go up too, but nobody knows.
It seems much more reasonable to invest in foreign currencies such as dollars, or even precious metals, no?

tl;dr -- Bitcoin's volatile nature and the lack of centralized regulation to keep it in check will be its downfall. He's probably right from a currency standpoint, but as long as people continue buying it as an investment vehicle (which also has the advantage that it can be spent, unlike gold) it will stick around and likely increase further in value.

that's a fundamental problem with bitcoin; it's too easy to steal. it would be like if a bank kept all their money -- hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cash -- hidden behind a door, and all that was needed was a password to get in. and there are no cameras or other real security measures in place. then, outside is a truck with the keys in the ignition and no guards anywhere.
it's actually easier than this, since you don't even need to carry or hide bags of cash anywhere. just click a button and millions of dollars go poof.

1. Credit card companies enforce terms and conditions with merchants that prohibit them from offering discounts for other forms of payment under most conditions.
2. Most merchants don't care because they realize that credit cards are extremely useful and facilitate easy transactions and equate to higher sales.
3. Nobody uses bitcoin (in the grand scheme of things) and there's little incentive for merchants to attract users, aside from a bit of short term publicity. If everyone started using deflationary currencies, sales would decrease (no access to credit), profits would decrease, and the net effect would most likely be higher consumer prices than the status quo.

the reason that the dogshit coin community was always so friendly is that most of them had very little at stake. when you can buy tens of thousands of coins for a few bucks, who really cares? hence, tip anyone and everyone, make it rain, etc.
shouldn't be much surprise that now some in the community want to inflate the coin cap even further. the problem is, it's losing its novelty, and when the price fails to make any significant move up during this upcoming bitcoin rally, people will give up on it for good in lieu of the next big thing.

Originally, bitcoin began with much support from cryptographers and libertarians. But as time went on and it became more mainstream, many young, liberal males were brought in due to the cool "tech" nature of it and the prospect of making a large pay day.

I keep my money in a bank of which provides online banking services, and they've never been hacked or lost my money. The funds are also there if I need to move them at any time.

Maybe the confusion here is the term "scale". Again, 740 thousand bitcoins would equal 600 billion dollars in ONE HEIST, given USD M1 supply of 10 trillion. I realize we don't know the exact sum missing from Gox, but it's going to be big.
Some of that Iraq money is unaccounted for, not stolen in one shot by an infiltrator. Some of it will be recovered. The difference is, Nobody walked into an office in Iraq and came out with a sack full of 18 billion. This, however, is essentially the scenario that plays out in the world of bitcoin; it is incredibly easy and appealing for an insider to siphon a huge sum of money to a private address, and difficult for victims to have any recourse.

Wall Street investors are smarter than all of us here. I've heard these rumors for ages.

Then they were waiting for Feb 1 for the Chinese crisis to resolve. Now it's April 15 for the Chinese crisis to resolve.
Again, they're smarter than you, and if they decided that bitcoin was good long term investment, they would have already invested a long time ago. There may be a few, isolated big trades happening offline, but if you expect a huge influx of Wall Street money after a certain date, then you're just a fool (to anyone out there in general).

I think a lot of people don't like it because it doesn't improve the status quo payment systems -- in fact it currently is a step back -- and merely holding them puts you at risk of theft and fraud.

It's hard to say, but just as friendster, and to an extent AOL chat rooms, etc helped introduce the concept of "social networking" to the masses, bitcoin has introduced the concept of trustless currency models to the public. So in that sense, we're still early in the cycle of this new phenomena. Perhaps one day bitcoin will be usurped by a superior P2P currency model, but only time will tell, since this is new territory for everyone.

your article doesn't address all the recent bitcoin exchange hacks. having your card number stolen is a minor inconvenience and requires calling the bank to have it canceled and charges disputed. At most you're liable for $50 in charges, but most banks waive that even.
Bitcoin consumers have no recourse if they're hacked or scammed, and theoretically, any hot wallet or cold wallet held by a merchant could be hacked as well.

Bitcoin is first and primarily a depreciating store of value, but unlike precious metals it has the advantage that it can be easily spent, if need be. Not too many merchants would accept payment in gold or silver, but more and more are now accepting bitcoin, because each is fungible and can be divisible up to eight decimal points. 
And if I really need to spell it out... technically this would be a taxable event, but in practice, individuals typically do not report online purchases on their taxes, unless it's something major. So you can spend your capital gains this way, without first converting to cash with your bank (which would definitely need to be reported).
1% or 2% consumer savings is really an after thought to this, given that bitcoin has been rising in value every year since its inception. As long as it follows Metcalf's law, it will keep rising, so just by holding, over time you will be getting much better than 1 or 2 percent savings in this fashion. It may not continue forever, but that's the burden you carry as an early adopter.

@_date: 2014-03-14 22:29:10
This just proves how dangerous an unregulated market is. If the risk of fraud is so prevalent that consumers should not be storing their coins with any third party, then it doesn't instill confidence toward the underlying security of the protocol. 
If users must be so security minded, then taken to the next step, how are they going to feel safe sending bitcoin to any merchant aside from the major players like Amazon? 
When they send coins to a smaller store online for niche items and the goods never show up, how do we respond? "Oh, they shouldn't have trusted that site, they don't have a strong reputation yet." These are problems users of credit cards don't need to worry about. They don't want to worry about this stuff, hence, they won't use bitcoin for shopping.

People love to cite public infrastructure when they talk about the importance of taxes.

Federal taxes all go to bullshit wars, foreign aid, salaries and overpriced pensions for government bean counters.

you see no reason why users would leave, but then you say you expect gox to be out of the picture? little confused.

first of all, lie detector tests aren't very accurate, which is why they're not admissible evidence in court. they're best used for trying to pressure a response out of  a suspect.

politicians are beginning to take bitcoin donations. if people actually donate and it benefits those with power in Washington, they will not ban. if their bitcoin wallets stay empty, then will ban the fuck out of it. I think we're still small enough that they don't care much at the moment, but I agree that one day they will pull the plug on it through a similar route as the Chinese (penalize banks that process bitcoin related transactions).
even if this happens, they can't destroy the network though. you're right that most miners would leave, but a few hobbyists would likely remain, and difficulty would drop drastically. in some form, it could live on, but not like today.

I'm saying that a single bitcoin has value because, not least of all, it is built atop an incredible protocol. THAT alone gives it and the network itself value. The fact that value has been rising steadily now for five years is evidence of that. 
I get what you're saying. One bitcoin is just a series of 1s and 0s, and people are fools for investing in something intangible, right? Perhaps someday people will lose faith in bitcoin and miners will pack up their hardware. Yes, it's possible, although I can't foresee what the catalyst for such a move would be yet. I do think it's shortsighted to dismiss bitcoins as a fad on the level of beanie babies, however. Beanie babies were dolls. Bitcoin represents an entirely new protocol for transferring value around the world and brings with it a distributed network of enthusiasts. This could -- and some could argue already IS, to an extent -- reshape global trade in ways we can't even fathom yet.

okay, but if bitcoin is being marketed as giving users the ability to "be their own bank", then it should be reasonable that they have 10k in digital cash stored somewhere, unless you imply that they should hold it in different locations (eggs in one basket arguement) ... but then, bitcoin is pointless, since it's not solving any problems. it's a step backwards in personal finance. 
i invest most of my money in stocks and bonds, and what little i keep on hand for emergencies is in a bank account. one single bank account -- i don't need to worry about it being stolen or disappearing. peace of mind. bitcoin doesn't provide that.
you can say that people need to learn, and that's their own perogative, but there's still no good case out there for why people should be using bitcoin rather than fiat. why would they go through the hassle of learning computer security concepts to use a currency which provides them with no appreciable benefits? perhaps early adopters of televeision sets had to spend a few minutes learning how to connect inputs, but if they screwed up, the TV or their money wasn't stolen, so seems like a moot point.

Okay, the Internet started in the '60s, when a small team of researchers connected nodes at different universities. E-mail was one of the first services built upon the TCP/IP protocol, so I doubt those with exposure to the budding network considered e-mail as a silly novelty. the military then invested tremendous amounts of money to expand it further, so obviously they realized the utility as well.
In the early 90s as the World Wide Web was created and Internet portals began popping up for consumers, people were signing up so fast that providers were giving busy signals to the dial up connectors. Within a few years, everyone was getting connected, had their own e-mail,addresses, etc.
So no, you're wrong, nobody considered the Internet to be a fad. services such as instant messaging, e-mail, and http captured the imagination of millions very quickly. to state otherwise is history revisionism and is dishonest.

My bank and others are bending over backwards to give loans. Wasn't the financial crisis of 2008 largely caused by the housing market and the pressure on banks to sign off on too many mortgages, even to people who obviously lacked the income and credit history to pay them back? I understand your theory, but there's no evidence in the real world that companies are failing and people losing jobs due to credit card theft. These costs are covered by insurers, so the bank can budget for losses and it doesn't affect their bottom line.
Most people only know their insured accounts, as you say, and they're happy with that. Why would they suddenly want to become "their own bank" and risk losing their balances? People don't like to worry about that shit, and doing so would be a step back -- not forward -- for personal finance.

Okay, but I'm one of those people who has owned a credit card for years and never carried a balance on it. I would like to think of myself as a "savvy" user, I research cards and find the ones that suit my needs the best and return the best rewards. I benefit exclusively from them. 
I don't fault people who carry balances, in certain cases it can make sense to put something on credit and pay later, though I've never encountered such a situation myself. A credit card is just a device, and the issuers are up front about the terms and conditions, if you're willing to review the paperwork that comes with them. Consumers are free to utilize that line of credit if they wish, or just pay it off each month.
The point is  given the option of credit, reward programs, and consumer protections, in a blind test with consumers, You'll find that they'll choose the credit card over bitcoin petty much every single time. I like bitcoin, I think it's fun and unique payment system, but will it replace credit cards? No.

they're waiting for legitimate interest. ebay has some relatively hefty fees, but they also offer a market of millions of potential buyers and professional escrow services, so you're still likely going to wind up with more cash in the end than you'd get from other forms of online auction or a traditional yard sale.

@_date: 2014-06-25 17:38:06
What people need to understand: Bitcoin isn't a bank. It's a trustless, irreversible payment system that is ripe for fraud, unlike traditional banks where it is much easier to track financial movements to registered bank accounts.
If people are going to store their coins on their primary PC or on a website accessed from their primary PC, they need to understand basic security principles. ie:
* Do not give access to your account to any third party software
* Do not run or install any files from untrusted sources (this included browser plug-ins)
* Disable Java and Flash software and keep Internet browsing to a minimum.
* 2FA everything
The best idea is to put most of your funds into cold storage, or at least store them on a dedicated PC.

With Bitcoin, the driver would have said, "ma'am, that will be 0.87 bitcoin" and she'd be like, yeah, whatever. If we can't expect people to check the amount before signing, it's unlikely they'll understand bitcoin decimals. Maybe he will start accepting bitcoin now :)

give me a break, most old people love attention. isn't reddit being a little over dramatic with this, "ruined his life" bullshit?

Not sure why this is a big deal; the government steals at least 50% of my income. And the ratio continues to grows year over year. This is a little more forceful, sure, but it's where we're heading!

of course, this notion of "priced in" is wishful thinking. nobody can accurately estimate the impact on market sentiment that gox will cause when they shutter their doors for good and turn off the trade engine. 
many mouth breathers on reddit and elsewhere are eternal optimists and still believe gox will "pull through" somehow. each passing day reveals that this is less likely to happen, hence the lowered faith in markets and continued downward slide.

Good video, and reminder of how manic people can be over fads. But here's the difference. Bitcoin DOES have some intrinsic value as a protocol, so I think it's unlikely value could go to zero within the next few years unless a fatal flaw is discovered and exploited. We could see value drop significantly though, it's definitely possible.
A good way to gauge whether you're caught in a hysteria or not is to check if millions of women and old people are beside you. Then it's a hysteria.
