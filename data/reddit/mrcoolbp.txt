I don’t understand why this is so hard. Give the keys to your lawyer in a sealed will. They have huge legal fiduciary responsibility to steward over willed items. Don’t even tell him what’s in there, just leave instructions how to distribute the coin in sealed message and instructions to not open unless upon your death. If the money ever moves while you are alive you take that guy for everything he’s got.

I disagree with this position. I followed bitcoin for many years (very loosely), and until I purchased just $50, I never really took the time to learn what it was and what it was about. I think when people put some of their money in they are finally "invested" enough to take the time to learn about it.

^ literally the next paragraph
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:06:49
Don’t invest more than you are prepared to lose, do your own research, don’t believe everything you hear, think critically.
Only use wallets that make you write down your seed. 
Learn to store your seed securely.
Hardware wallets are a bit pricey but are strongly recommended for large amounts of money.
Don’t keep all your coin in one place. Don’t keep coin on exchanges unless you are prepared to lose them (to hacks or mismanagement). Exchanges hold your private keys for you and send money on your behalf (they are the bank in this example). Not your keys, not your money!
If you are your own bank you must assume the risk of being a bank and manage your keys (which is why we recommend HW wallets, they never expose private keys). Seeds must still be stored securely. Anyone with access to your seed can steal all your money associated with it. If you lose your wallet and the seed, your money is gone forever, there’s no phone number to call to get it back. 
As for obtaining bitcoin, there are a lot of options: 
* Coinbase
* Square Cash App
* localbitcoins.com
* bitcoin ATM near you
All these services have varying advantages, and disadvantages, and fees. Remember to move the coins off of exchanges into wallets where you control the seeds and keys.
Let me know if you have more questions.
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:42:31
This is a great question. I think many governments will try to ban crypto. Look at China, they have gone back and forth on the bans, yet look at the ridiculous amount of activity there. 
I recently interviewed someone in Venezuela using bitcoin to survive, his country has had currency controls in place for years and by his words "they don't work" because if people are able to use a currency to preserve their value and feed their families, they will do whatever is necessary. 
If the US banned crypto it would be a pretty big blow to the price, but, it might in the long term set us way back in the global financial markets because China and many other countries are exploding with financial innovation products churning out of this space. So that ban may end up screwing us over in the medium-term, but it will become clear that countries that embrace bitcoin will pull ahead in global markets and trade. That should give incentive to governments to embrace it.
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:28:12


Actually, I'm counting on it. It means they are giving up on fiat and buying into the new status quo. Oh, and on the way our value goes up, we get more exposure, the market gains confidence in bitcoin.
The downsides to these services is people aren't learning how to store their own keys, and some will learn the hard way about letting centralized servers store their keys. Furthermore, commingling of bitcoins in centralized accounts open the door to fractional reserve bitcoin or other more shady custodial practices where they are essentially creating more bitcoin they they actually hold. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:28:02
Got you fam:
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:36:13
Yes, this is a criticism of these services for sure. It's a catch 22 kinda, can't have custodial service without this risk, and we can't have institutional buy-in without custody, and we can't have worldwide adoption without institutional money (vast majority of money is institutional).
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:30:37
No you need a device you control. A an exchange or a bank are custodians, centralized services that manage your keys for you.

Coinbase could start lending out bitcoin tomorrow and give birth to fractional reserve bitcoin, not much is stopping them. Actually, I don’t know if there are any regulatory items that cover this, i’d Imagine some laws governing banks and their lending would apply.

what exactly is your goal?
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:46:50
I mean, I have to disagree. My experience is with the Shift Card specifically, so YRMV.
My Shift Card draws from my coinbase wallet, so I simply need to keep some there or transfer to this wallet to make a purchase. The purchase incurs ZERO fee to me, I get market price for my bitcoin (I did the math, it was dead on for coinbase price), and yes, the retailer receives FIAT.
The idea here is that this is a stepping stone for people living off of "pure bitcoin". If I'm out and about looking for businesses that accept bitcoin directly, and I don't find one, I can still use my Shift Card to pay at any VISA merchant and draw directly from my bitcoin and pay using it without incurring any fee at the time of transaction. The card only cost me a one-time fee ($10 I think).

Money requires legitimacy and trust. There's no difference in the value of BTC vs USD, only the confidence in each respectively. If people trust USD more, they will store their money there, and the reverse is true.

But adding address hopping is trivial for wallet software, and I can make a new wallet that is not connected to KYC, receive payment from another "clean" address, and there's no way for some surveillance system to see that. Sure, a lot of coins are tracked via exchange KYC these days, but many are not. That mitigates the blanket surveillance system we have now, and that is at least moving in the right direction. It's possible privacy coins could gain traction for those that need more privacy, mimble wimble is on the horizon for BTC possibly, and lightning adds another layer of abstraction as well.

USD is the unit of account in much of the world, followed by EUR and a few others. And they aren't always stable against each other.

Nothing you said makes any sense, you need to do more research.


Uh...so no difference between gold standard and fiat?


You see no difference between these types of money? You don’t understand why we don’t use conch shells any more?


I argue that governments have too much power because they can print money without raising taxes while robbing wealth from everyone that holds their money. They aren’t accountable to their citizens because the citizens don’t see an increase in taxes, they just see the value of their money decrease over time and they don’t make the connection. Politicians can promise anything and pay for it without taxing, making them seem like gods that can do anything. If they actually had to raise taxes to pay for things they would hear about it from us. This leads to a distorted markets, bloated military, and endless war
You don’t understand the concept of sound money so just don’t pretend you do.

Because the argument that “inflation is good” is inherently flawed, and I was pointing out but one example refuting your point. Have you read the Bitcoin Standard? Any Austrian economics? Mises? Hayek?
@_date: 2018-10-25 14:03:53
I have gone over this stuff before so i’m pasting some of my previous comments:
If you read about the history of money, you would find that the most effective types of money are those with a stable supply. This is known as "hard money". You might also find that civilizations that used hard money saw their citizens prosper and invest time into projects that spanned many years or even decades. The argument for bitcoin is simply the argument for a money with a stable supply.
The lie that "inflation encourages economic growth" is a disgusting one perpetuated by the bankers that control our money supply, and therefore control the world.
 Right now, bitcoin is a baby currency with a ton of uncertainty, a lot of people trying to sell back to fiat, and very little market penetration. Furthermore, as we inch towards adoption, we have a lot of people buying in which makes the price increase (which is effectively deflationary, despite the supply being inflationary right now as miners discover 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes).
If we could consider a future where some significant market-share was attained (let's say 15-20% of people on the globe actually using it as money), and we were actually approaching 2040 where we asymptotically approach 21 million coins, then the hard-supply deflation begins. However, in this case with more adoption and use it would have a ton more liquidity, way less uncertainty, and subsequently a much more stable price. As the price stabilizes traders and hodlers see less gains.
So when we actually arrive at the "deflationary" stage that most people talk about, deflation would probably be rather low.
I don't have all the answers, and there's lots to consider, but we need to re-evaluate the argument that "inflation is good".
Deflation encourages savings, and we still need to buy stuff so we still spend money. Investors STILL get more money for investing in a deflationary world too.


Because of time-preference. You still need/want stuff like food, supplies, and toys. Why pay for the new shiny iPhone now for $1000 when you could have one at the fraction of a cost in 3 years?
Inflationary money is beneficial, to the people printing it. But there have been warnings for centuries about the devil of inflationary money. Even Keynes himself saw the truth:


@_date: 2018-10-16 16:00:54
This is r/bitcoin, so most of us laugh at "blockchain" being a revolutionary tech by itself because bitcoin combines blockchain with a few other tricks to create a very specific recipe for a very secure "immutable" network for transactions.
That being said I think there are some applications for blockchain beyond bitcoin, but not many, and certainly not by simply "adding blockchain" to some existing tech. Unfortunately I don't have any books to recommend to you on that front.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution by Klaus Schwab is not about bitcoin, but it's along the lines of this paper.
The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous is not about blockchain but it does have some quotable statistics and information about bitcoin's implementation of blockchain that may or not help you.
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:37:32
I'll give it a go ELI5 style:


Autarky is "economic independence or self-sufficiency", in other words they want to be able to manipulate their supply of money in order to maintain their power and independence from other states. Before, under a gold standard, they aren't able to endlessly print money and manipulate prices (which affects what wages can buy). 


When you increase the amount (supply) of money there is, the amount of people that want it (demand) goes down (so the value of the money goes down when you make more of it). This means that prices go up, $1 buys less stuff the longer you wait.


Credit expansion is carried out through "fractional reserve banking", or, in other words, banks are allowed to loan out your money and they only have to keep a small fraction of it in "reserve". This actually increases the supply of money (credit expansion) and benefits bankers (because they charge you interest to borrow from them even though they are creating free money). By increasing the supply of money they make it worth less. The amount they they have to keep in reserve is called the "reserve rate", and they can change this amount which effects by how much you have expanded the supply.


The other thing that they can change is the "interest rate" at which central banks create money and loan it to regular banks. The interest rate at which they loan it to regular banks is also manipulated. This is a tool they claim allows them to control the markets. They would tell you that without all of these tools that we would have more crises, more recessions, more crashes, or whatever.
Saifedean instead argues that it is their very manipulation of these factors which distorts the free market and prevents it from doing what it's supposed to do, which is identify the opportunity cost of investment. When you have 0% interest, you are giving people money for free, and they invest in whatever the heck they feel like (because it's free money). If they had to actually pay a rate of interest on money borrowed that represented the cost of actually borrowing money, they would invest in much more "sound" investments.

DEXs don’t really have fiat on-ramps. You will need to get your money on the bitcoin network before using a DEX, and really at that point DEXs are only good for trading between different cryptos.

You just saying i’m Wrong over and over doesn’t prove your point.
@_date: 2018-10-06 01:10:40
No the result is an actual free market.
The problem with inflation is because the money’s value is distorted, the free market isn’t able to properly identify price or opportunity cost.
Inflationary money encourages short term gains and risky investments. Hard money encourages proper planning for the future and allows the free market to do what it does best, identify value correctly.

That is up to you as a business owner. It certainly is shady practice, I believe AMEX did the same thing this year. However, you have to also think about your business. Most businesses that accept crypto claim like .5%-1% of their transactions in crypto (overstock.com CEO said something on this order of magnitude in a podcast I listened to). So if paypal is a significant percentage of your payments, you might be leaving customers with less viable options. Another thing to consider is if you directly accept cryptos, the tax situation can become more work as you may have to report capital gains if the price goes up (this depends on your locality's laws).
That all being said, I think anyone in this space that believes in this tech and has the ability to do so should accept crypto in one way or another (even if it's getting converted to fiat for your own accounting piece of mind) because if we aren't doing it, no one will.
@_date: 2018-10-26 03:28:22
It’s estimated that less than 5% of the people in the world have bitcoin, so to me this is meaningless, not to mention the top wallets are all exchange wallets, not individuals. Wealth distribution is fucked everywhere already, bitcoin doesn’t change this.

Interesting, I see what you are saying. So mining off-world isn’t viable under bitcoin. However, could it still be used to send and receive inter-planetary money? If I send a transaction from Mars to Earth it will propagate at the speed of light, reach Earth 20 min later, and start returning confirmations back on mars within the hour or so right?
No different than someone signing a transaction offline here, waiting 20 min, then actually broadcasting it over the net.

All that we can see from this chart is some addresses have a lot of bitcoin in them, and most addresses have very little. Most people have many addresses, exchange accounts even more.
I think the most salient information is that .07% of addresses contain between 100 and 1 million BTC each. This .07% comprises over 16,000 addresses, some of which are whales, some of which are exchanges. 
What this does not tell us is what percent of total supply each category accounts for.

Well put, but I think it’s more complex than that.
What little money poor people save up, they have less avaiable to invest because they need liquidity and can’t always risk even low volatility; and, wealthy people can easily allocate a significant portion of their money to the markets to invest and best inflation, able to weather corrections. 
Inflation steals a percentage of wealth over time which hurts the poor more; to rich people that percentage is the difference between getting a pool or not, to poor people it might be the difference between affording a house at all (or college, car, or whatever).
Rampant consumerism and exponential growth is not sustainable. We need to lower our time-preference and start thinking about the future again.

From my own thoughts I would add also: when you say that people are encouraged to hodl bitcoin (like they do now) I think you are missing the point. Right now, bitcoin is a baby currency with a ton of uncertainty, a lot of people trying to sell back to fiat, and very little market penetration. Furthermore, as we inch towards adoption, we have a lot of people buying in which makes the price increase (which is technically deflationary, despite the supply being inflationary right now as miners discover 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes).
If we could consider a future where some significant market-share was attained (let's say 15-20% of people on the globe actually using it as money), and we were actually approaching 2040 where we asymptotically approach 21 million coins, then the hard-supply deflation begins. However, in this case with more adoption and use it would have a ton more liquidity, way less uncertainty, and subsequently a much more stable price. As the price stabilizes traders and hodlers see less gains.
So when we actually arrive at the "deflationary" stage that most people talk about, deflation would probably be rather low. Not to mention the plethora of other crypto currencies, some of which are actually inflationary (for example ETH, or Stellar).
I don't have all the answers, and there's lots to consider, but we need to re-evaluate the argument that "inflation is good". Can't wait to finish this book, I have a few days off coming up and I'm going to destroy the last few pages of it.
Edit: also wanted to add that deflation encourages savings, and that we still need to buy stuff so we still spend money. Investors STILL get more money for investing in a deflationary world too.
@_date: 2018-10-01 13:43:50
The artificially low interest rates are definitely a sign that something is screwed up.
But I disagree with your thinking on the deflationary nature of bitcoin.
First off, the supply of bitcoin is actually inflating right now; miners “discover” 12.5 new bitcoins that enter the system every 10min.
The rate at which bitcoins are “found” is decreasing with each halving, that rate of increase in the total supply of bitcoins is asymptotically approaching zero (when we reach 21 million coins).
Now, that bitcoin inflation doesn’t really affect the current price, and the reason is that the current bitcoin price is very volatile. That volatility is because of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Also, not everyone accepts bitcoin yet, so when the price goes high enough, people sell bitcoin for currencies that have wider acceptance. With wider adoption it might make more sense to just spend bitcoin instead of selling.
However, my point is that the reason people hodl now isn’t because of deflationary supply, it’s due to the adoption curve creating a massive rise in the price due to such low liquidity in the bitcoin market VS a currency like USD.
With confidence, liquidity, and more acceptance, volatility would plummet. By the time you get to 2040, the rate of deflation would be quite low, and the hodling won’t bear huge gains anymore.

At best, fiat is an experiment. You cannot sustain any currency simply based on an ideal. The fact that fiat has a built-in devaluation to the actual number of coins means it is not a finite currency. It must change into reality, not imaginary money built upon an experiment. Right now, it's a gambling game. If it were not, it's value would be about nil. When the gambling reaches a place where those with enough fiat can say what is up and what is down by how they print money, that game is rigged and smart people will start to walk away. Close to that now. If somehow, something could solidify fiat value it could live a longer life, but unless somehow stability comes to fiat, bitcoins are going to leave it and people will too.

Assuming we transition into a world with more bitcoin and less fiat, banks will still provide lending and custody solutions. The truth is average Joes don't want to take responsibility for managing their own keys/seeds, and would rather let an insured institution steward over their money for them. People may even be happy to pay extra for such a service. Crowd-lending will certainly not be able to cover the credit needs of the world in the near future (if ever), so we will still need institutions with a lot of capital to loan that out to people, interest will probably be much higher in a world with sound money too.

I disagree, these are last-ditch efforts by these nations to prevent large-scale flight away from their monopolistic currencies. Petro will not work. We’ll have to see how the others play out, but if people are informed (big “if”) and given the choice (it’s pretty hard to effectively ban bitcoin), they will choose whatever money works best for them.
What’s great about today, is we are actually giving people a choice. Previously you use the de-facto national currency where you live and there was literally no other choice (this is the government monopoly of money).

Money has three main properties, store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. 
Bitcoin is already a good store of value over long timeframes, and it’s potential for medium of exchange is exponentially better than any current money (multi-sig, smart contracts, micro-payments, etc).
Unit of account is the last stage of money, that only comes with widespread use.

At first glance this seems to be an argument that proves bitcoin will never be stable.
In fact, it’s much more complex. Gold has been the best form of money over 100,000s of years because it’s supply remains very stable because it’s not easy to make more. However, it’s not a good medium of exchange because it’s not easily divisible and it’s hard to send over long distances (especially with large amounts).
This leads to people issuing notes or IOUs. Every time this happens eventually someone starts issuing more IOUs than gold. Not to mention that gold is still mined and used as a commodity.
In a few years no one will be able to make more bitcoin. It’s a much better medium of exchange. It’s already looking like a good store of value (over long timeframes).

It means we have never seen something “become money” on the open free market in real-time. When gold became money it took hundreds/thousands of years. Acquiring a monetary premium means that the commodity (in this case BTC), gains a premium as it gains network effect and use. That causes the price to rise.
My point is, this is unprecedented in history.

Even BTC is still on its way to this. Alts are where BTC was 8 years ago, but they are riding the coattails of BTC’s success.

So right. This thread has no idea what it’s talking about and OP is simply talking about the rate at which the supply is increasing and calling that inflation (which makes sense). Inflating the supply CAUSES prices to drop subsequently if the actual demand remains the same (because supply increases).
 This is clear from the 2 gold lines in the chart (they are both stable). This is not clear from the bitcoin data because the demand is the driver of the price, the supply has little bearing on the price due to the relatively low liquidity.

Bitcoin does use a lot of electricity, but a lot of that is renewable. That sounds to me like an argument that we should be pushing for more renewable power generation, not a push against bitcoin.
Bitmain does not “control” bitcoin, they contribute to its security. If they rise in hash power too much, people will leave the pools like they did last time. Bitmain has no incentive to conspire to attack bitcoin (51%) because it would destroy their business model and holdings.

Fiat money still holds a lot of value for a lot of people. To the best of my understanding bitcoin is much better money, but we’ve yet to convince the vast majority of the population so far, and it will take time still before we do. Until then, fiat works fine for people especially on short time scales, it works a lot better than bitcoin. Of course the reverse is true over long time scales at least so far in bitcoin history anyway.

To be fair to the people that are confused here, inflation refers to rising prices:


However, this is in general due to inflating the monetary supply, decreasing demand for the money, and decreasing its value relative to goods and services.
The confusion here is that OP is referring to inflation of supply, not inflation of prices, which I admit is not conventional when using the word.

You have no idea what you are talking about or you simply misunderstood what OP  meant by inflation; OP is referring to the inflation of the monetary supply (which, to your credit, is not convention, inflation usually refers to inflation of prices).
Gold’s supply is very stable, and bitcoins supply is algorithmically determined (to a very large degree, although some miners do not claim block rewards oddly, which is why bitcoin supply inflation in the chart is not straight lines separated by the halvings). Of course the price is determined by the demand (which is not predictable as you point out) and the supply doesn’t really matter as much at this point in bitcoins life.
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:19:41

It means many times the price has plummeted and approached this number, but enough people either stop selling, or start buying (or both) that the prices has continued to bounce back off that number.

Running a full node is cool because you are technically validating all the transactions on your own. That being said many people don’t run them, and if you have no experience running a server it’s not absolutely necessary for every single person to run one (more nodes are better though).
Also, I think the challenge with using a ras pi is that you need a TB drive (blockchain is over 200gb already) and you need a good amount of RAM, but someone can correct me here.

I don’t understand your question exactly. Where are you buying bitcoin? What rate are you talking about? Do you mean fees instead? Fees are a convenience metric, services like Coinbase Pro allow you to buy bitcoin with virtually no fees, so yeah you do have to shop around. The actual price of bitcoin should be pretty similar no matter where you are buying. The only exception I know of is bitcoin ATM (BTM). They often bake their fee into the price of bitcoin, simply offering a higher price to buy at with “no fee”. 
As for the wallets I haven’t used Jaxx so I don’t understand what you are asking. I stay away from web wallets, prefer open source software.  I also believe in general that mobile OS are more secure than desktops, but that is a gross generalization. I always recommend hardware wallets for storing any large amount of coin (and keep smaller “spending money” on mobile wallets).
Having multiple wallets could be considered a good thing because there are more wallets that need to be “hacked” to get all your coins.

I think we have actually identified why these hype cycles happen like this, because most people are followers, they wait until they see fervor before they become interested (also greed when they see the price go parabolic).

I think what people sometimes overlook is not just that bitcoin could work for countries like Venezuela, but that this is THE use case. Americans don’t have a dying need for this tech, but you don’t have to convince a Venezuelan.
Bitcoin has a lot more use for the developing world vs the developed. I think, also, that this is how it starts, the next few countries that enter 100%+ inflation will gravitate towards bitcoin, and as it proves itself in these places it will gain  more global footing and respect.

I think that’s how it starts though. Who’s the next Venezuela? Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Iran, Greece? Bitcoin will always be there, and the next time it just might be ready to absorb an entire county’s commerce. It would be the first large-scale bitcoin experiment, and if it goes well the world will take notice. That would throw some gas on the fiat fire. Larger countries and currencies are certainly the last to go (if fiat ever dies to bitcoin).
My fear is that no matter how I examine this scenario, I think there is always a tipping point where people all decide to start exiting fiat en masse, and the governments of the world won’t be prepared for that. That’s where it gets rather interesting and rather scary.
The hope however though, is that we do have a system of money to fall back on, a system without any borders or any way to be controlled by failing governments.

When you are forced to condense your communications to only a few words, it forces everyone to be concise, which I like. If you want to post a longer diatribe you can thread it (multiple tweets in a row), or just post a link to your blog or whatever. 
If you are serious about following bitcoin and it’s development, consider giving it a shot.
I still come here but vastly prefer Twitter already.

Most people don't have access to savings accounts with 3% interest. Poorer people need a larger percentage of what they earn just to survive, have less opportunity to invest in assets with inflating prices, they have less opportunity to "gamble" on the stock market to preserve wealth, less opportunity to diversify, because they need to have liquid cash for expenses.

Fair point about the CPI, I will do some more research on that and GDP deflator, thank you. How we define the CPI does affect the data though.
We do have to look at the big picture, another huge issue we are seeing with inflation is the pension crises, it's a pyramid scheme that shows warning signs right now, largely due to the inflation we had in the 70s/80s destroying capital stock accumulated by the baby boomers leaving us with the bill. Who decides how much inflation is "correct"? Who is really benefiting? We can't see the future, so we have to drive the economy out of the rear-view mirror by manipulating the supply of money and crossing our fingers, it's a bit crazy in that context. I'm also concerned that there may be real systemic risk, and it was hidden in 2009 by 10 years of rather extreme 0% interest rates leading to the longest stock market bull run in history.

It works fine because no one uses it. Scaling to meet global transaction demand would require significant further block size increases, leading to increasing large blockchain size and increasing memory demands. The BTC blockchain is already over 200gb and growing. With larger and larger memory requirements for nodes, decentralization would decrease exposing the network to significant centralization. That’s very dangerous for a decentralized crypto currency.
Plus, Lightning Network though still in beta is already working and seeing continued growth with instantaneous TXs and a one Satoshi fees.
BCH has already been obviated.

@_date: 2018-11-10 01:16:06
Well, it's not technically a scam. I'll try to actually tell the story objectively.
Basically there was a big debate about how we should scale bitcoin, and there were 2 main "sides" to the debate.
One side said we should simply increase the block size (the size of one block in the blockchain, it holds all the transactions from the last ten minutes).
The other side believed that 2nd layer solutions (like "Lightning Network" and "Liquid") was the way forward.
They never came to agreement so one side split off into BCH, simply increasing the block size and moving on while a majority stayed on the "core" chain. In "core" we hold the position that increasing the block size too quickly will make it very expensive to run a node (which help secure the network). It's not that we never intend to increase it at all, just that our position is that eventually we will need 2nd layer solutions anyway, so that's where the focus should be.

There’s a lot of pieces here. I’ll try to give a brief overview
1913 establishment of federal reserve, “gold standard” but only 40% reserve and they expanded money supply beyond reserves. Eventually they had to contract money supply which caused extreme deflation and concerns about money supply vs reserves which led to bank runs.
1933 new deal and more expansion of money supply
1944 establishment of Bretton Woods (gold standard) rate of increase of money supply kept in check by redemption of silver
1971 abolishment of gold standard

You gloss over this but it is still a pretty big issue. The majority aren't getting &gt; 3% raises every year.
To your other point, average savings return is a laughable .08% in the US. Avg lending rate in the US depends on what type of loan, but surely you'll agree it's significantly higher. So the lenders are largely insulated from the "negatives" of inflationary debt, while the not-wealthy are encouraged to live in debt (and not hold inflationary money) because it's economical to do so. This creates a steady stream of interest payments for the lenders, while firmly rooting the the not-wealthy in a perpetual state of debt and little savings.

There may be better resources for a more brief overview.

Right, due to the network effect.
[Bitcoin ATMs are being installed at an exponential rate]( institutional-grade exchanges (like bakkt, fidelity) are still coming on board. Custody solutions (like coinbase custody and CASA) are still coming online. The lightning network is still in beta (no longer alpha). I think it's fair to compare this period to the early period of the internet, the time period between ["Its initial demonstration in 1969"]( and 1995 (26 years).
We won't see widespread adoption until these tools are in place, just like we didn't see widespread adoption of the internet in the early 1990s, even though email was around in the 1970s, TCIP was around in 1982, and commercial ISPs were coming online in the late 1980s.

Close. Inflation slowly whittles away at debt (as does it inflation). But inflation incentivizes debt, and debt proliferates in inflation, while its disincentived with deflation. Winning the current game is about holding just the right amount of debt; too much, you can’t afford the interest, too little, and you aren’t taking advantage of debt evaporation. Wealthy people can hold debt just like they can hold money, and they benefit either way. One might argue they can finagle their debt better than the poor, whom also tend to hold more of the savings in money, rather than stocks and assets.

No, BTC won't "save" Venezuela, but it IS providing them another option that the government isn't really able to stop. That's a good thing. And bitcoin isn't even yet in it's final form, it still inflates faster than the USD, gold, and most other currencies. Soon that will not be the case though.

Yeah but the debt since 1971 is going parabolic, they aren’t achieving 1%, on average it’s 3% (over 100 years) and there were periods of 10% or more, and that’s just the USD.

By the same token, deflation isn’t inherently bad, it’s only the hyper deflation from 1929 that was horrible. This happened because they expanded the money supply far beyond how much gold they had and had to contract the money supply.

No, the MODERN system of money is authoritarian (see government forced monopoly on money)


You have no idea what you are talking about; Bitcoin is neither centralized nor authoritarian. People are free to choose to use bitcoin or not. That's the opposite of authoritarian. If you don't like the rules of bitcoin you are free to make you own coin can try to get your friends to use that. That's the free market, the opposite of authoritarian.


It's nice to imagine a society in which we are all free and sharing, but it doesn't scale to large-scale civilization due to greed and crime. You glossed over my points about the problem money solves in a society (because you probably don't understand it) which allowed us to create computers and the internet on which you are communicating right now. Without money you would still be sitting in a hut gathering all your own food and making your own clothes from scratch with no free time to do what you want. There would be no time for art or music.
Feel free to try to convince people to drop money and be "free", I doubt you'll make much progress outside hippy gatherings (which are a great time, don't get me wrong), but modern society has many benefits (among it's many woes).

No, we are independent "free-willed" organisms that are comprised of trillions of cells which are created from a blueprint of genes. Genes are a recipe to make humans. After a human is made, there's no telling how they will act. A human is the sum of his life experience, musings, and actions. Genes only get you to be alive, they don't dictate what you do.


So who is creating these rules if not top-down rulers? This essentially sounds like socialism. As I said before, good luck with that.


That's hilarious, I'm athiest/agnostic.


That's the opposite of what I'm arguing, instead, I'm saying that we should let the free market actually function, instead of manipulating the very system of money upon which it works. Because money itself is manipulated the free market isn't allowed to do what it does best. In a sense this actually ties into your complexity theory. 


I certainly hope this is true but I have not observed that. And I am still failing to see how any of this translates to a system of economics where rational actors can create and exchange goods. How do you solve selfishness except to hope that everyone plays nice? A system of rules is the only way. 
Capitalism is not the enemy as many of us thought. Instead, it's that capitalism has been bastardized and broken by a manipulated system of money, and therefore what we have now isn't actually capitalism, it's at best a form of socialism, which isn't working. The truth is that those "in charge" making the rules aren't able to efficiently determine how markets should function, we have to let the markets identify efficiencies by themselves. True capitalism. 
Bitcoin enables global commerce on a level we have never seen, governments won't be able to use capital controls, and they will have a hard time subsidizing everything without taxing heavily (which is rather unpopular). It won't stop them from tariffs I suppose though.

Fiat money is directly manipulated at the supply level. No one can manipulate the supply of bitcoin. You either don't understand that, or you are trolling.


Yes, someone developed this system, I'm not arguing that. I just happen to believe this is the fairest, hardest money that we have every had.


I suppose from that perspective, but there are ranges of authoritarian, and compared to the current system this is opt-in and "democratic and meritocratic and public/open approach to deciding the central rules" which in my opinion is better than a forced monopoly.
Good luck with your idealistic free society where everyone is nice to each other and works together without any rulers and without commerce, it sounds like fun, it just sounds purely idealistic.

You call it FUD, others call it assessment. 
Global debt exceeds the entire money supply. There isn’t enough money in the whole world to pay it back. Debt is exceeding GDP nearly everywhere, in China its 300%.
Debt is being increasingly added with no plans to pay any of it back. Interest payments alone on debt will eclipse some of our largest budget items in the next few years; the definition of living beyond your means and over leveraging.
Interest rates have remained near zero (much lower than the run up to 2008) for so long. This has propped up the markets into a huge easy-money bubble; and even a hint of a interest rate rise caused a massive stock selloff this year. The only way to go to keep the money flowing is negative interest rates, which is a sign of the end.
We are in unprecedented territory by almost every metric.
Fiat currency is a failed experiment, in many cases with catastrophic results (Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and on the brink are Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, Iran, Greece, etc.).

The idea of debate is that we "argue" a perspective so that we might weigh the merits of statements on each side and possibly emerge with some new knowledge. You are constantly getting lost in the semantics, maybe this is why you don't like debate. Relatedly, I feel like you ignore everything that you don't like and don't engage on direct questions asked to you and instead muse on what could be without providing a how. I'm genuinely trying to provide feedback for you, though it is probably coming off as being rude, so I apologize.


Honestly I appreciate that, though you haven't provided any data to suggest that we are ready to move beyond money, I do appreciate your perspective.


Bitcoin is more resilient than you think, I could provide some reading if you are interested. Bitcoin is not susceptible to forks, it's the forks that are susceptible to attack and centralization. Bitcoin is already too decentralized to attack. Forks are the ones eating themselves alive right now, bitcoin will be fine.


This is disingenuous. It's better than what we have from the perspective of sound money and government forced monopoly on money.

Banks need to be insured by governments because they practice embezzlement as a rule; banks use your assets for their own gain hoping to have enough when you request it back from them, in doing this they wrecklessly gamble with the money supply and the wealth of anyone that holds it (see 2008).
BTC needs no lender of last resort because it’s supply is deterministic.

Transact on the last mile. Most businesses don’t accept BTC directly yet, though that could change if the trend continues.

But the crypto currency marketplace is exactly as you describe, everyone trying their own version, using whichever rules work for them. I simply believe that long term bitcoin is going to absorb most of that market, 99% of all coins will diaf, and there may be a few other niche coins that do something bitcoin can't do. However, even bitcoin can learn new tricks, so who knows.
My point is, I believe bitcoin will emerge from the chaos, like a system taking order. If we as a civilization choose to use bitcoin, much like gold was chosen by the markets, it's not really authoritarian, it's market convergence.

1. If you sell BTC for a higher price than you bought it, you end up with more $USD. Many bitcoiners believe it is still quite early and BTC has a lot of growth over longer timeframes. It’s impossible to know what future price will be, do not trust any price predictions you see.
2. “Trading bitcoins” like anything is just buying and selling them on the open market. If you only wish to buy or sell between BTC and USD there are many exchanges where you can do this (Binance, Coinbase, Cash app, LocalBitcoins.com). Careful, any time you trade anything for BTC (“sell them” or purchase something with them) it is a taxable event (at least in US, check local regulations).
3. You can buy any amount of bitcoin like $50 worth for example
4. I use cash app personally but I have used BTC ATMs and Coinbase in the past. Shop around for the best experience and lowest fees.
I would also add personally That I recommend learning more about bitcoin before entering this space. The notion that one can simply sell it for higher price then they paid originally is not inherently flawed, but I encourage you to go down the rabbit hole and learn more about this technology.

Maybe you don’t understand the problem money solves or punks in general.
Punks certainly used money, the Ramones made a great deal of money for example.
Money solved a very important problem in society and still does; the barter system’s inherent flaw is the “double coincidence of wants,” where the fisherman wants to trade with the blacksmith, but the blacksmith doesn’t like fish, only chicken. The fisherman has to go to the chicken farmer only to learn the he is looking for wheat, not fish. The fisherman has to trade the wheat guy, then the chicken guy, only then might he get some forged tools.
Money allowed us to move beyond this issue and move into highly specialized jobs, which was the beginning of civilization as we know it. While it’s nice to think about a society where we don’t need money, we are no where close to that (unless you invented a perfect Star Trek replicator that you are hiding from us)
Modern money systems are authoritarian, in the past we allowed various money systems to emerge organically and the free market chose which ones worked the best. In the end gold beat them all due to its properties contributing to a stable supply.
Then governments came to make gold easier to transport by making gold notes, which is where it got corrupted. Bitcoin is a return to organic monetary systems emerging on the free market.
Bitcoin is anarchy (no rulers), bitcoin is freedom of expression, bitcoin is challenging societal norms; bitcoin is most definitely punk.

Nope, as soon as you change the rules of the system (and everyone else doesn't) you have effectively forked it. No one will go along with your system, they will continue on the current one.


Yes, that is what it means. You can't force every node and miner to change either their ledger or software implementation. Therefore you have created a fork.


Correct, they can't stop you from changing the rules, but that means you created a fork, because NO ONE ELSE will change the rules on their implementation (bitcoin "core").


No they won't, you created a new version that no one else wants.

So who's projecting their beliefs onto others here?
I believe that the organization of trillions of neurons itself generates an intelligence that is able to decide what to do based on it's own life experience and/or mood. No supernatural needed. 


Once again you show your ignorance of bitcoin. Sure, it *was* decided at some point, anyone joining the network is agreeing to use those rules. But no one can change it now. In changing it they will create a fork, and I am quite confident the vast majority will never use a fork that alters the supply in any way. And if they do, it will be because they all wanted to, opt-in, opposite of authoritarian.


You claimed bitcoin is centralized and authoritarian, sorry but that's basically trolling around here. Maybe compared to a utopia where we don't need money you might have an argument, but, as you have failed to propose any kind of answer to how we would exist without money other than "life, uh, finds a way," you are grasping at straws.


I would appreciate your perspective a lot more if you actually explained anything instead of just saying "ah man it will work out, look at how cool the human body is! It works, that means everyone can just get along without money!". 


Historically every type of money (besides gold) is "easy" money, easy to make more of. For this reason every system of money before gold collapsed, tearing society apart in the process. Bitcoin is the hardest thing to make more of, and eventually there will not be any more made. It will be the hardest type of money to ever exist.


As I said it's a scale, and bitcoin is on the "good" side of the scale compared to anything else that has ever existed. It also "grows, changes, and learns" in an ad-hoc, decentralized method of development and implementation.


Maybe if you are really thinking long time-scales. As I said, the only society plausibly proposed that functions without money is probably star-trek due to the replicators obviating the need for commerce. While 3D printers are advancing rapidly, we're quite a ways from an actual replicator, and assuming it needs input media you still have to solve the media distribution problem if we can even invent this tech in the first place. So for now, I'm focused on what can actually help mankind.

You can't explain how your "free" society works because you are just being idealistic and don't understand.
