What miners do you run? If you have actually purchased from them you would also know they take USD wire transfer.

Yes I pay for electricity and I mine in the USA. A S9 purchased in December would have a ROI of less then a month.
Bitmain has gone out of its way to ensure that miners don’t end up only in China and are being operated by miners in other countries. The secondary market price for s9s in China is 2-3x of the  MSRP  in the USA. If you try purchasing miners online from Bitmain you will notice that they limit the number of units being purchased. If you want to place a large order directly you need evidence that these miners will be operated in the USA and will be not resold. 
Bitmain is the biggest advocate of bitcoin as they also have the most at stake. They know they if one company or even a country controls to much hashrate it puts bitcoin at risk.

Mining bitcoin with S9's is still extremely profitable. You can hate on Bitmain all you want however they are doing a decent job compared to their competitors.

I paid for quite a few sites, cointracking.info is by far the best website I have used. It’s expensive but it’s worth the price if you have substantial holdings.

Are you moving into other cryptos or are you cashing out for fiat?

I did not make any point, I just offered a  accurate translation  on the main gist of the report. Instead of using google translate like most people and interpreting as I wished, I asked a person who use to write press releases for one of the largest companies in China for a accurate translation. 
I guess I should also mention despite the news I still didn't sell any of my bitcoins.

yeah I agree. For a site thats suppose to support high volume trading I think its silly that 2 step isn't even a option

I took a laptop from IT did a clean install of windows and then installed armory for offline cold storage. Of course I then made 3 backups and stashed them throughout my house

vendors cannot use Bitcoin (translated by my Chinese wife), Bitcoin CANNOT be used as a trade currency anywhere in China
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:31:31
I'm assuming your Chinese based on all your spelling errors in your previous posts. Where in the advisory does it say that Bitcoin can be used as a currency ? 
I'm currently working in Jiangsu province right now. If you can name a place that accepts Bitcoin I would be happy to go there and spend btc to show my support.

The first point says bitcoin cannot and should not be used on the marketplace as a currency  and point 2 is financial institutions cannot do business related to bitcoin 
However take this with a grain of salt, the Chinese have a lot of rules that aren't followed and they are excellent at finding loopholes

This is exactly what I said the day the news came out and because it wasn't wanted to hear I got a bunch of downvotes for it
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:31:42
That's the 2nd part which talks about financial institutions 
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:34:37
My wife's translation is Bitcoin can be traded but not used as a form of currency on the Chinese market  
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:56:25
I'm actually in a similar situation. I put in 40k yesterday night and I'm already up 10%. Hopefully it keeps on going up
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:24:32
This is incorrect, Bitcoin cannot be used a a form of currency to buy or sell anywhere in China
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:41:59
Or by the end of the month at the rate things are going

Hello, my wife and I run a small clothing company and we would love to accept bitcoin on our site. I will PM you my email
