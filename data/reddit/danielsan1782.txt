When you start the chrome app, you can chose if you want to go to legacy or segwit accounts. Maybe you choose the legacy accounts?

Try Blockkeeper.io - support for ios and segwit xpubs

if you don't want to enter the amount of your coins manually into a portfolio app, you can track you current amount and transactions directly on the blockchains with [BlockKeeper]( Just scan your addresses or xpubs (currently only available for Bitcoin) to have a similar experience to the coinbase with the certainty to see what you really possess on the blockchains.

I get that and respect that very much. Just to let you know: blockkeeper always runs completely locally. But either you can start the application from your device or you start it from app.blockkeeper.io and you start it from our website, all code and therewith key derivation and other calculations only take place an your device in a secure and encrypted environment, leveraging the Crypto API of modern browsers. This why it only works with the most recent browser versions.

Thanks. Privacy is very key and also for security good cryptographic primitives are important. So no email or password requested from the user. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:36:34
Because many modern HD Wallets only give the user access to their ypub or zpub and derivation done directly is less resource intensive. The whole app including derivation runs in your browser in a encrypted environment using the Crypto API of modern browsers.

Segwit and legacy from xpub is supported as well.

You only require nodejs if you want to run it on your local machine for development and testing. Using the app under app.blockkeeper.io does only require a modern web browser.

This is not only a great summary of the book but also of the experience most people have with Bitcoin while they go down the rabbit whole.

And most importantly:
"It should be noted that the announcement of the cryptocurrencies for base trading pairs is not a certification of their legal tender status or other legal statuses, nor is it a certification of any kind related to such cryptocurrencies."

Never use a paper wallet! This concept is to complicated for the average user, as he need to make sure the computer user for generating (and the printer) is neither connected to the internet nor compromised.
Use a combination of hardware wallet as cold storage and mobile wallet to store a little bit for fast and convenient access to iniate small payments. Samurai wallet is a great choice (android only). 
Privacy is definitely an issue. But the more people run a node at home, the better the interfaces will adopt to that and privacy will improve. With samurai and the ledger live (hardware wallet interface) you can already connect to your own node.

Especially interesting for people who are new to bitcoin or are thinking about moving their coins to take control over the private keys

Gold is just a hedge as long as you put it into your safe at home or maybe at the bank into you own safe deposit box. But almost everyone who is actively trading gold is relying on third parties, that they get the gold covered for them - no hedge then.

who else thinks, that BCH is just a tool for insiders to increase their BTC amount? I mean I would do it like that: create a fake Bitcoin (Hardfork), promote it as the only real Bitcoin (which failed so choose it to be an altcoin) and then drive the FOMO of the people to pump the price and when the price is good enough it's time to dump and convert into BTC.
Am I totally wrong?

Best to follow Bitcoin Munich on Twitter to get updates regarding livestream or recordings of the conference

You should do that. Because currently you just trust bitstamp they have anough bitcoin for all their users and don't lose them or don't get hacked etc. It's like holding bitcoin (which is meant to be digital cash) as deposit money on a "bank account". Bitstamp showing you how many bitcoin you have is more like bitstamp showing you how many bitcoin they owe you.
Here is a good instruction about how to deal with it:

Non HD Wallets are very seldom these days. They are also called JABOK (just a bunch of keys) Wallets and you would need to backup every single private key generated.
