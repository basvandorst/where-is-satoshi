Yep, however, normally I don't use a mobile wallet because phones are generally insecure, more vulnerable to exploits.

No one has an answer for you. You are the only one that can answer based on how much you want to invest and potentially lose. You are investing $2k of $8k which is very wise.

This is normal...just like it was under 10k months ago. Ride the wave bro!

Mobile wallets may be safe, but most mobile devices are not very secure.

At least your predictions are realistic! :)

Sorry to hear this. It's a very strange thing hearing about someones passing away and seeing them tweeting like normal just days before.

It depends on a couple of things...how much you have, how security consensus you are, how convenient you want your bitcoin to be.
Personally, I use electrum for day-to-day transfers and then Ledger for longer term storage.

Do what you think is right, as in what you can afford to lose. Keep pushing forward!

Wow, that is incredible. Thank you for sharing this, I think it's time for me to empty my bank, charge my credit and borrow from family and friends. I may be homeless tomorrow, but I'll be a uber-billionaire in 2030 :D

Anywhere you put a USB drive you should encrypt it with something like veracrypt. Better yet, use veracrypt and then ZIP the contents with a different password. That way if there is a zero day vulnerability you are completely safe, as well as if the USB drive is stolen. Of course, always have backups of this same exact method.

It's fun to think back on in terms of the internet... as a tech company, you would want a .com, net, .org in your company name. Now you want that, with even more tens of more domain extensions, as well as social media accounts (facebook, reddit, twitter, etc). Now every tech company will wants its own cryptocurrency. Wow!

So Wow! Much Bitcoin! Oh My!

Neat website idea! People love to look up net worths, including the equivalency of bitcoin is a good way to spread the word!

I gave him 34 seconds.

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

I think creating a semi-detailed guide would be extremely beneficial for bitcoin!

My dad's friend is Satoshi. Fun fact.
