Santander wont even let me open an account now, apparently I'm "blacklisted" as a "security risk" since RBS closed my account several years ago over Bitcoin related activity, they must share some info.
Revolut is okay but withdrawals seem to be done manually and half the time never even worked for me. My brother who works in Canary Wharf says the office is full of dodgy looking Russians.

A 330d will remap to a 335d power though, you can't do that with a 325d. It really depends what you want with your car, but if you tune up a 330d perfectly then it is mind blowing for a reasonable price.

Autotrader has others in better condition with less milage for £5000 - 0.60 BTC. Not clocked also.

It's fucking annoying that in English we use the same word for both meanings.

I view this as a good thing, competition drives innovation. Let them use blockchain, maybe we can even take some of the better ideas they come up with and integrate it into Bitcoin to make it even more superior.

Are you sure? American reviewers are saying their models only support Etherium at the moment but other currencies will be added shortly.
What's your source?

And the rest, try being an international vendor, they completely rip you off and love destroying businesses by illegally taking longer to process transactions than many countries law allows. They currently operate in blatant violation of EU law but for some reason continually get away with it, (the majority of transactions have to be cleared instantly AKA 50.1%+, high risk transactions can take up to 2 hours and absolutely all within 24 unless criminal behaviour can be proved). Yet PayPal delays almost every transaction for one reason or another. I suppose because nobody has been hurt badly enough to sue them yet.

No, many countries already exempt currencies from capital gains tax, I know I was exempt when I sold a lot of Bitcoin in the UK over 5 years ago, and my accountant even triple checked all the case law with our tax man (HMRC) and the EU.

I don't really see why, it's no different to people hoarding gold, artwork or any other kind of precious tradeable asset.

The law has to be universal, you can't tax based on the volatility of a currency or you'd tax Venezuela and Zimbabwe out of existence.

Yeah why isn't it in català or español? Either way it's clearly some scumbag from outside marking this beautiful city.
Also technically maths is the truth.
