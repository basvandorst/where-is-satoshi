Bitcoin has basically gone up 6x from January.  I'm hoping the correction comes when it hit 10x (7000 USD), and we correct back down to 5x (3500), ready to start the next wave.

Does Floyd Mayweather and John Cena tweeting about it fall into the same category as cab drivers giving hot tips?
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:27:13
Yeah, if you look long term, it's just been a steadily rising tide.

Here's how it works.  The more people that hold long term, the more stable the currency will be.  If more than 50% of people buying in now are buying in with the intention to hold long term, the proportion of currency that is changing hands through trading will continue to decrease.  This will lead to price stability.  Once there is price stability, bitcoin will become more useful as currency.

or at least bought SiaShares instead of SiaCoin

As a payment system, it's still speculative.

it's a monthly service now.  I assume you aren't paying for cable?

They still have only the most rudimentary knowledge about it.  I'm sure even the commentators who speak about it have yet to open a wallet.

Thanks.  I hadn't heard of rsk before.
Any thoughts about IOTA?  Totally decentralized and free transactions sound amazing.  Can bitcoin get there?

You'll get a tax penalty.  But if your principal is high enough that it doesn't matter to you, you might decide its worth it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:33:13
That's a good fucking question.  I just have faith fees will go down.

I wanted to buy a little in 2010, but it was to complicated and I forgot about it.  
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:31:44
true in a sense.  But blockchain technology now is different and there are coins that have an entirely different value proposition.  Altcoins in 2010 were mostly just trying to copy bitcoin.  A lot of the coins coming out now are very different.  There are still a lot of bullshit coins.  This kind of feels like investing in the internet in 1994.  Microsoft is the obvious pick.  But Cisco and Intel and AOL are all out there as well.

Fair, but bitcoin is leveraging the blockchain as a currency solution while other coins leverage the blockchain for business solutions such as data storage, document authentication, etc.  In these cases, buying into these coins is more similar to investment into a company.

What makes you think they won't be pegged to ethereum?  From my understanding the functionality aspect is related to smart contracts.  Will there be bitcoin based smart contracts in the future?
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:33:17
I agree it is a reasonable compromise, but from what I understand, the 2x code is not adequate.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:31:02
Holy shit.  This makes me feel like its time to sell my bitcoin.  This is like when Kennedy's shoe shine boy started talking about stocks right before the big crash.

Well, if he's thinking of holding, and believes in the long term success of Sia, then shares are more appealing.  Sia only commands like 64 terabyte of storage so far.  If they displace AWS, those shares will be worth a lot.

I'm not saying it isn't an operational payment system.
But to say that it will be the dominant payment system, or even a sustainable system - that is still speculative.

It's a mess.  Journalists have no idea what they're talking about.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:52:22
This seems complicated.  Which wallet would you recommend for doing this?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:16:07
holy shit.  I just bought at 2800.  Saw it hit 2900, and figured wtf.  I have to buy again!  I'm an idiot.  FML.

I had a similar experience in 2013.  Thought it was cool, had trouble purchasing, so in the end I didn't buy any.  Now that it's easier to buy, more people are buying and it's worth more.  Your post encourages me that there is still much more appreciation to come.  You should probably try to pick some up now.  How about using Coinbase with a real credit card and not being retarded?

first day of school, don't mention anything about crypto.  Right a public key and private key on the blackboard.  Tell students that if they can solve the puzzle they can keep ten dollars.  Keep $10 of bitcoin on the address.
