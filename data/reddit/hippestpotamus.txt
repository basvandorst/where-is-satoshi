You said if it does disappear you will lose your faith in humanity. Are you retarded?
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:04:08
Bitcoin won't disappear. Simple as that.
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:35:59
I lost my bitcoin buying mining power for 5 years. That one hurt. The payments are still okay but I would've been far happier with the cash.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:01:06
If it does disappear it'll be forked off and all the money will transfer to the fork. I don't think it can disappear completely ever barring something that sets us back to the stone age.

This is a bump and run reversal bottom pattern. So not far from the truth!

Anyone who says people are spending their "bar mitzvah money" on bitcoin is a clown to me.
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:22:41
You should've put in $8. Nobody could calculate the math on that but I bet it's a lot.

I'm trying to figure out if the web api in Hidden Wallet is secure enough to use in a production environment. I'm going to create a mobile and web ecommerce platform using bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:40:55
We can afford chips and dip now instead of just ramen
@_date: 2019-04-27 09:18:14
Yeah idk if that will work for multiple users with different wallets that I maintain. Thanks though.

XXXL. I have a 100 percentile head for my age
@_date: 2019-04-27 19:53:52
I think I'm confusing wallets for addresses. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:25:31
I meant Hidden Wallet that got renamed to WasabiWallet but I'm using the older code
@_date: 2019-04-27 09:10:32
But does that allow for the creation of multiple hot wallets? I'm also on Windows running ASP.NET Core if that helps.
@_date: 2019-04-01 01:48:08
I tried to access the shopping cart and the link was broken. Excellent work I'm looking forward to seeing what you do in the future!

I lost $40k to btc-e when it went down, then I waited, got $30k back. All is not lost.

Haha look at this guy having a job
@_date: 2019-04-27 09:02:03
Yeah WasabiWallet is based off of HiddenWallet I just know that it can mix bitcoins and runs on the Tor network so I feel it's secure enough I was just wondering if I could use it instead of Wasabi Wallet because it's web-based and WasabiWallet is not from a cursory code review.
Aka is Hidden Wallet production ready
@_date: 2018-11-29 09:29:40
I think it's pretty ridiculous to a) classify a large group of people as having a low IQ on an entire forum (the entirety of Reddit) where people make asinine comments daily and to b) not be able to spell a simple word like "performance"
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:45:23
Dunno what plane you're talking about but we're on a rocket ship that just landed on the moon and is returning back to Earth for a refueling.

I understand exactly what you're getting at, it's more the way that you say it that's annoying. Prior growth &lt;=&gt; future growth. It's indeterminate.
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:52:57
Do you mean exponentially? Exponential growth on a log chart is a straight line

From your post history you are a super troll. Terrible and fat one too. Go back under your bridge.

It was a veritable abortion to my ears
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:57:33
It checks on the software to see if it's verified when stepping through the procedures to load the ledger up with crypto and activate it

A) you're on a bitcoin subreddit
B) you can't be a shill for a decentralized currency that makes no sense
C) you have little to no understanding of the capabilities of cryptocurrency if you're just going to tell me there are no benefits at all
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:41:59
And then you have no benefits of cryptocurrency where you have the ability to be a store of value and the ability to be a ledger and a payment network all in one. Pass. Good try Western Union salesman. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:20:44
It's pretty naive but I don't want to give it away publicly. I will tell you it can be searched for however. I switch between a neural net and RSI bot depending on a bull or bear market. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:45:17
But it means that people are still actively using the coin one way or another and speaks to future volatility downwards being less dramatic than what we've seen -- at least that's what we hope. Regardless volume is always good because of the network effect! Volume = Services Rendered. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 23:01:16
Good point. Too late for me this time but it was plastic wrapped and sealed so I assume it was safe but who knows? Hopefully everything's good because the verified Nano Ledger test passed so let's hope they haven't found a way to spoof that algorithm.
