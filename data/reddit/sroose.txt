Standard OpenVPN clients have had a long time to improve on usability. 
Specifically I'd say stability -- the client often disconnects and then just doesn't automatically retry but gives you internet so you don't realise you're disconnected -- and the ability to specify what networks (4G, Ethernet and specific Wi-Fi networks) you want to use the VPN for by default.

Addresses don't "send or receive" money. They are just a way to "address" a wallet. It's like asking "can I send post to someone in an appartment if I live in a house myself?"
To which addresses you can send depends only on the wallet software you use, not on which addresses you use yourself. So if your wallet supports bech32 (whether or not your own addresses are bech32), you can send to it. If your addresses are bech32, only people with wallets that support bech32 (independent on whether their own addresses are bech32) can send to you.

Currently all transactions are in plain public, period. It's hard to be worse.
So how does lightning work? You have some channels open with some random nodes. When you pay any node in the network, onion routing through the network is used. This means that you wrap your payment packet in such a way that it only reveals to every node in the route what it has to do with it until it reaches the destination.
So, what information does this reveal? The first hop after you (one of the nodes you have a channel with) will know the amount your sending to him and where he has to forward it, thats all. It's important to know that that node cannot know whether that is a payment you are making or just someone else's payment where you are an intermediate node.
Of course the recipient knows about your spending with him, but that's trivial. So concluding, other than that, the nodes you have channels with know what happens on those channels but can only guess whether you personally have anything to do with that activity. Other than that, no one knows anything of payments that happen.
When ultimately you close the channel, the blockchain sees the eventual balances of the channel (let's say you initiated the channel 50-50 and close it 70-30). That could be the result of 1 payment or of 1000 payments. There is literally no information about anything that happened in the Lightning Network that reaches the blockchain (and thus the public) when you close the channel.

It really doesn't matter how many people "upgraded to Segwit" for how the Lightning Network will rollout. There is no such thing as "upgrading to Segwit" anyway. You might mean "have a wallet that supports Segwit".
If you're gonna use the LN, your Lightning client will support Segwit (because it has to). And it really doesn't matter whether your previous wallet did or did not support Segwit.

I'm just trying to help you by explaining.. If you don't know someone's private key, and you are generating private keys at a high rate, how will you know you found it?
If all you thought experiment was about was how fast you can iterate over all private keys, without even checking if you found anything, then still you don't need SHA256 at all. Then you just count from 0 to 2^256 with a simple counter. It will take you an eternity as well, but a ton faster then when you're doing SHA256 in the meantime..

I envision the following transition in the mining industry on the long term:
In the initial days, electricity was not so much of an issue, compared to just having the fastest hardware. GPUs made CPUs obsolete and ASICs made GPUs obsolete (to forget about the tiny intermezzo of FPGAs). Whomever had the most recent hardware that was more specialized for Bitcoin mining, won.
Now that ASIC efficiency is coming hitting a ceiling, the dynamics changed. Electricity consumption is becoming a great deal and you have to gain your edge in getting cheap electricity. Miners in remote places where water power provides them with cheap electricity gain an edge, as well as anyone able to get excess electricity of traditional generators for free. Right now, whomever gets its hands on the cheapest electricity wins.
In the future, I think even this will pass. [Once the physical limit for ASIC manufacturing has been reached]( all devices will be using the same amount of electricity for its hash output and they will be abundantly available. I believe that in the future, the world will move increasingly towards using electrical energy for everything instead of fossil fuels. Also for heating. Since there is only so much "free or very cheap" electricity available, people will need to find ways to use the heat that the ASICs produce. Since integrated circuits are from a thermodynamical standpoint nothing more than converters between electrical and thermal energy, people will start using mining equipment as heat sources. When the limit on ASIC efficiency is reached, producing mining chips is nothing special and will be done in abundance. Chips will be cheap, but the revenues from it will be small since the whole world has access to them. So, in this new era, whomever finds the best ways to reuse the heat generated by the mining process, will win.
How I see this happen is that companies will create mining hardware that is actually optimized for heat distribution. [This idea already exists for cloud hosting.]( Office buildings will fill their basements with mining farms to heat their office spaces. Individual home-owners will purchase heating systems based on mining hardware. Since the efficiency of electrical-based heaters is by definition 100% (except the ones based on heat-pumps), Bitcoin miners will do the same job as traditional heaters. So basically, since every unit of heat put into your house will cost you that same amount of electrical energy anyways, you can just as well generate the heat with a mining chip instead of with a simple resistance.

I've had problems with reopening my own True Crypt containers. There is some things you need to look out for.
First and foremost: true crypt as it used to be has been discontinued. Some alternatives arose like VeraCrypt. However they usually have a slightly different protocol. F.e. VeraCrypt let's you enable "TrueCrypt mode". So try some different alternatives and look for the TrueCrypt mode.
Next, there is two ways to have a TrueCrypt container. It can be a file on the drive, or the whole USB. 
In the latter case, make sure you're using the same OS as he was. If he was using Linux or OS X, especially, you might now be able to open it on Windows. Try to use Linux (with VeraCrypt f.e.). Then, in Linux, there is also two ways to open the USB partition. Usually, your USB will be in a path that looks something like /dev/sda (or /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc,...). And there will be a partition /dev/sda1. I always forget which one of the two to open. Try both. TrueCrypt, when selecting to open a container from a partition, will allow you to select both /dev/sda and /dev/sda1, so try both.
Some more advanced implementations also allow you to specify the decryption used for the drive. Keep on trying. I think there is a fair chance that the password is the same, but you are just struggling with TrueCrypt itself. The money is worth trying for a full day or two.
Also, if there is some logic in the password he gave to your parents, try to okay the logic. Things like if it ends with a P (for parents), try the same with a B (for brother). Small changes like that.
And lastly, try all you can yourself before handing over the drive to anyone else. If there's a million dollars in Bitcoin on the drive, even very honest people will think twice before handing it back to you if they cracked it.

I had the exact same idea two months ago when we were looking for heating for our small appartment. Noise was indeed the main problem.
Also, here in Spain, it's hard to find second hand old hardware that is not very much overpriced. A tiny last issue was the fact that they need an Ethernet cable to be connected to them all the time. Our router being in the corner of our place where we need heating the least, that would have been a cable mess :D

It worries me that no one pointed out that this is outright bullshit.
Generating addresses from private keys is not simply a SHA256 operation. It requires doing some elliptic curve math, followed by SHA256 and RIPEMD160. The SHA256 part is absolutely minor in the procedure. The majority of the processing goes into the EC math.
Of course, doing SHA256 is basically the most optimized calculation ever put in ICs. EC math is not. It's done on regular CPUs and takes several milliseconds.
This calculation is absolutely useless. It calculates how hard it would be to find a SHA256 collision. Entirely different problem.

The big problem with hubs is that they require massive liquidity. First of all, in order for users to be able to receive through hubs, the hub needs to put money on the channels. Second, let's say the user only sends, over time, the money gets pooled up on the hubs side of the channel without being used. Channel funds are hot wallets, so they are risky.
I know initially there was a lot of talk about this kind of topology. There will most likely be hubs in the network, there is no question. But I think the liquidity problem made researchers put their hope on every user having ~3 random initially-one-way connections.
In that scenario, you enter the network with opening a channel with a random node (heuristics will find a one that has uptime and good connectivity with the network) and commit only on your side. You will do this maybe 2-3 times when your current channels are not sufficient. Others might do the same to you, you accept up to like 5 channel requests becsuse they are one way anyway, but you can use them to receive.
This way, every user has his own required amount of liquidiry put in, spread over some random channels. I can't remember the title, but there was a paper detailing this kind of network and showing that it can have good connectivity properties with low liquidity requirements.

Basic thermodynamic learns that almost everything ends up as heat. An electromotor turns electrical energy in movement and heat. The movement (kinetic energy) will eventually be lost in either brakes (heat), resistance of the tires and the road (heat) and movement of air particles (which eventually cause friction between themselves, resulting in heat). 
The same counts for an integrated circuit. The electric energy that goes into it will eventually come out 100% as heat. It's nothing more than electrons moving around in tiny circuits, which is like a current through a wire, it only causes electric friction and results in heat.

There is no need for them to actually lose money for doing this. They can each include big-fee transactions in their own blocks (without broadcasting them to other miners), so they will just get refunded their fees. They can literally create one tx with a 100BTC fee to swing the average up like crazy, since many average fee calculators don't ignore outliers.
The only actual cost they have is the opportunity cost because putting a fake tx in a block uses a slot that could otherwise be used for a tx with an actual fee. But since the lowest fees to get included in blocks goes all the way to 20 sat/byte, this opportunity cost is negligible.

1. The seed is most probably BIP39-compliant. That means every wallet using this standard will be able to import your seed. Most wallets support this. I can't speak for the future, but I'm confident this standard will keep getting support at least for the next 10 years. If a new standard overhauls it, there will certainly be recovery tools etc.
2. Be careful with memorizing the extra word. Usually I would advise against using it and instead just backup your seed very securely (and twice!).

No. We all wish there was. It's like 3GB on disk, with some índices to search through it, that goes to 5GB fast. That alone is hard for quite some computers.
Then comes the other issue of a node shutting down or crashing. You don't want the shutdown of your application to take 5 minutes. Or that after an unexpected shutdown, you'd have to build it back from scratch. Of course you could save it every hour let say, but then you have to shutdown the entire activity of the node during the time of the save.
All non-trivial things to think about. I'm sure there might be users that would benefit from it. I'm also convinced that a lot of big miners (or pools) have this because they are very heavily dependant on block validation time.

Allow me to try and explain you in a different way. So lets say the address with 1,000,000 BTC is 1HUGEaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX. Of course you don't know what the private key is for this address. So the algorithm you are using to "crack" the address is the following:
1. generate private key `privateKey`
2. create address for private key: `address = base58check(RIPEMD160(SHA256(privateKey)))`
3. compare `address == "1HUGEaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX"` and try again if not equals
What you are doing is doing step 1 a lot of times. Without doing steps 2 and 3, you will not know whether you got the right private key. So doing step 1 2^256 times is a hard task, but doing steps 1 + 2 + 3 that many times is many times harder since the hard part of this algorithm is in step 2. 
And it doesn't matter how you guess different private keys in step 1.  It's just if you accidentally generate one twice, you will have to do step 2 and 3 again. So the most efficient way is to just count from 0 to 2^256 instead of calculating a lot of SHA256 hashes, since they are more expensive than just increasing a value by 1.
EDIT: Address generation uses only a single round of SHA-256.

You say the number of transaction verifications is O(nt) where n is the number of transactions and t is the number of nodes.
Now, I think its fair to say that both if these scale up with the total number of users, N. So f.e. with an **average number of transactions per user `C1`** and the **probability of a user to run a full node, `C2`**, then 
`nt = C1 * N * C2 * N = O(N^2)`.
Like Gregory said, it is indeed polynomial, but the constants also play their role.

Entropy theory like that doesn't really apply here. Before and after a period of mining with an integrated circuit, the state of the system isn't really changed in a structural way (I mean if it is changed, it's random), so you can neglect all effects from it.

I don't think you understand crypto protocols. Users also verify all transactions and blocks. A miner, whatever percentage of the mining power, that mines an invalid block, will see it discarded by the users. 
The problem is when one entity owns the brand and the software. Then they can produce a hard fork (raise reward or max coins) and proclaim that that fork is now the "new Bcash". Bitcoin's strength (as opposed to f.e. Ethereum) is that no one rules over the brand. People can produce hard forks all they want, but they can't get away with trying to call it Bitcoin.

FYI, "Cracking a Bitcoin address using a quantum computer involves finding a public key that corresponds to the hash contained in the address." is not entirely correct.
Finding the public key of an address gives you nothing. You would need to find the private key who's corresponding public key hashes to the given address, which involves elliptic curve calculations as well as a hash function.
Remember that there are still bitcoin transactions being used of the pay-to-pubkey type, who basically contain the public key itself instead of the hash or address.

First, if Joe has a decent wallet, the first transaction will be deleted as soon as the wallet receives the double-spend, so he will not see the transaction in his account. 
Second, a second is quite long in computer time, I'm not sure but I believe that if there is too much time between payment and double-spend, miners just ignore the second. 
Whatever happens, there will always exist a very small chance that Al doesn't get the money. It's a small chance though. But hey, what if I hand Al a false dollar coin, which he will only notice when I'm already gone, or hand him forfeit money, the same thing can happen. 
So again, requiring zero confirmations is no problem when we talk about beers, but when you f.e. exchange 5btc with a person through LocalBitcoins, I'd wait for the first confirmation to come in, or ask the other person to include a fee.

I think it would be a good idea for Amazon to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. Since several Amazon websites are also accepting orders from customers from abroad that are already paying in a different currency (f.e. UK's website accepts Central European customers that pay in Euro), accepting Bitcoin will make Amazon even more accessible.
Also, being a web-shop that also offers digital goods, accepting digital money makes it possible for your customers to do their entire shopping online. There are people that want this and they will shop wherever they can do so.
But, first and foremost, Mastercard and Visa charge horribly large fees. Using Bitcoin incurs a 0% fee for you or a very low fee if you will be using a Bitcoin payment processor. (f.e. BitPay works with plans and charges no fees at all)
The choice of Bitcoin is logical for any healthy online business nowadays and those that realise this first, will be the first to profit and build reputation in the digital currency space.

Creating addresses has nothing to do with mining power. Miners calculate SHA-256 hashes and when you create new addresses, the most work is done by elliptic curve calculations. So most miners that have a high SHA-256 hashrate will not benefit from it when trying to create a vanity address.

This is not at all a problem with the protocol. The Bitcoin mining protocol is OK, the only problem is that, due to the nature of SHA-256 and the long inter-block time, it's too hard for individuals to mine solo (mostly because of the exponential increase of mining power/device).
That's why pools exist and that's a good thing. But miners are still supposed to use their hashing power wisely. Even with pooling, mining could be perfectly secure and decentralised. But it would require miners to not all group together, but distribute among difference pools.
Blacklisting won't help, firstly because blocks of Ghash.io cannot be identified (maybe currently they can, but they can easily change their IP and extranonce format). And secondly because not everyone uses Bitcoin-Qt; actually, few people do. Besides, blacklisting perfectly fine blocks makes no sense at all. Also, blacklisting a miner/pool at ~50% would make the remaining network only half as secure.

There is no such thing as "cracking a private key"...
What you do is finding a private key for a certain public key or address. There is literally no SHA256 involved in that until you go from public key to address.
Bitcoin addresses work as follows:
1. calculate a random 256-bit value that is your private key (you do this with as much entropy involved as possible, usually SHA256 is not at all involved in this step, just reading random values from entropy sources)
2. calculate the public key corresponding to this public key (using elliptic-curve mathematics); this is the most "expensive" step in the process
3. calculate the bitcoin address of the public key which is the base58check encoding of `RIPEMD160(SHA256(&lt;public key&gt;))`
To "crack" a key or address, you will want to find a private key (in step 1) that will give you access to funds in a specific address. You only find out what address your private keys correspond to in step 3.
So in this last step, some SHA256 is involved. However the computation required to do that round of SHA256 on a normal CPU is just a fraction of the computation needed for the EC mathematics. So having a computer that is a trillion times faster at SHA256 will not help you out at all. You will need a computer that is good at EC maths. Quantum computers are, so a reasonable computation would consider quantum computing.
I know you say napkin math. But you need to do napkin math on the right problem. What you did was a napkin estimation of the time it would take to fly to Mars by napkinly calculating how fast a car could possibly drive without having any friction.
EDIT: Address generation uses only a single round of SHA-256.

All xBTC abbreviations follow the SI prefixes, so you should understand these.
XBT is a synonym for BTC (following the ISO standard, independent currencies should start with an X)
The harder one are bits, which are a millionth of a bitcoin. So 1,000,000 bits = 1 BTC = 1 XRP = 1,000,000 uBTC.

I think most systems require one or two confirmations. That's quite reasonable. The chance that a transaction will be orphaned when it has been included in a block is really small. (When the block it's in gets orphaned, the chance is high it is included in the block it has been replaced by or will be included soon.) 
Many services that deal with far smaller amounts of money require no confirmations. 
You can make the priority calculation yourself. Older coins go before newer ones and transactions that have a fee are almost always included within 5 or so blocks. So the only transactions to watch out with are those without a fee, especially if the outputs they spend are fairly young. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 21:02:34

Confirmed transactions cannot be double-spent. 
As for unconfirmed ones, the chance is sufficiently low that a double-spending transaction will be confirmed over the original one. So the only problem can occur when the transactions are sent right after one another so that not all nodes in the network received them in the same order. 
It is possible that a miner will accept a double-spending transaction if it has a fee and the original transaction doesn't. However currently most large mining pools don't do this. But again, an unconfirmed transaction with a fee can be considered safe.

Ripple is not centralized. It's decentralized, yet not distributed. It allows you to chose who to trust or act as a issuing party yourself.
Ripple is not intended as a store of value, it's purely a network for transactions and market-making. And as opposed to Bitcoin, it is actually good at that. Fees are near-zero (really near-zero, not like Bitcoin's are) and happen in 1-5 seconds without piling up and making growing the network's footprint.

What can happen is that someone spends one of those Segwit transactions on the minority fork and there will be a temp split. But not a hard fork since both sides are equally valid. Since the majority is on the Segwit chain, this one will always be longer and thus this will be the one that people mine on.

Did you consider merging with Tails? Tails provides a distro focused on privacy. I'd better consider forking Tails and add a Bitcoin wallet than forking Ubuntu.
People that will eventually use your distro are not going to use it as their main OS, but as a save haven OS for offline or minimal connection wallet management without the risk of key exposure. Having a snappy OS like plain Debian+Gnome 2 seems like a better solution for an USB-booted OS than full-fledged Ubuntu.

This is an interesting answer, I've been wondering about this as well.
But here you assume that Bob also spends money instead of only borrowing. 
Now consider the case of central banks that give out money in the form of loans. For the velocity of money to make sure this debt can be payed off, money also has to flow from the central banks into the economy through other means than borrowing, right? Except for the central bank paying for expenses, which is peanuts compared to it's lending, I don't know it does.
EDIT: I just realized that central banks do pay interests on deposits. Even though they tend to be very low or even negative these days, that means in theory money can flow out of central banks into the economy. So in a "balanced" economy, the rate with which CBs charge interest on loans, balances the rate with which it pays interests on deposits of banks.

I know how Ripple works. Their ledger gets modified every few seconds. It's not a blockchain as there is no "chain". Opposed to Bitcoin blocks, which contain all transactions and needs to be kept in its entirety in order to know the current status of the ledger, Ripple clients only keep the current status and adjust it when new transactions come in.

I mostly think of it like [this]( But didn't know about the term federated.
I see it described as "distributed network of centralized networks" or "client-to-server-to-server-to-client architectures". This is only partially true for Ripple.
Although most users will indeed connect to the network through a node they don't operate themselves, it is still perfectly possible to host one of the nodes participating in the consensus algorithm yourself.

My comment was in reaction to this statement. It will never be possible to use the size of the mempool in the core protocol, because different implementations might have different pool sizes and not all nodes necessarilly receive the same transactions.
Tx priority on the other hand, can be calculated unambiguously on any machine. So in theory, adapting fee requirements based on tx priority is possible and makes sense.
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:13:40
I think giving some more attention to **transaction priority** might solve this problem for a large part.
In Bitcoin, tx priority is very similar to "stake" in altcoins that use proof-of-stake mining. Priority increases with the age of an output. This means that "bad actors" will need need a whole lot of old money to attack the system. If someone wants to clog the system with a lot of transactions, the will need a lot of old outputs with a decent amount of coins in them. Because once an output is spent, the coin age is lost.

That is the "total transaction output" amount. You should check the transactions first. 
What happened is that one guy with a ~7500 balance sent tens of small transactions that are all in the block. So every time he uses the same funds to send like 1 BTC, he creates an output of 1 and an output of ~7500. So for every transaction he makes, ~7500 gets added to the total transaction output pool, by actually only sending 1 BTC.

@_date: 2017-03-17 11:08:38
Fast transactions with low fees means a high transaction throughput, thus requiring big blocks and high bandwidth. 
Running a full node is constrained by the processing power of the machine and the bandwidth of the connection. With bigger blocks, the bandwidth and processing requirements of those nodes increase a lot. Up to the point that only a handful of privileged parties can run them without making huge losses. Probably miners some miners and some service providers.
This goes against the decentralized idea of bitcoin where every user should be able to be a validating full node. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:46:04
Let's call it a chain split then. 
All soft forks are backwards compatible, but that does not mean that it is safe to just update regardless of what others do. Even though the "others" (because with UASF they might not even be the minority) will see your block as valid, you might not see theirs as valid.
So first of all there will be a huge amount of temporary chain splits and resulting reorgs while both sides stay at ~40-60 %.
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:55:54
Isn't this quite normal? If you want to buy an amount 5X, you'll get better prices to put 5 limit orders slightly below each other for X each instead of putting an amount of 5X at the higher one.
Putting the 5x on the lower one reduces the odds of the buy actually happening.

Remember that a hard-fork requires an explicit clausule in the code of all clients that says "from before this block, process blocks differently".

@_date: 2017-03-08 11:35:00
That's only because the Satoshi client (admittedly used by almost all miners) rejects non-standard transactions, right?
Miners that don't want to impose that restriction and allow any valid transaction (including non-standard ones), will be punished. Ideally, all miners should do this, right? The only valid reason I see for miners not to do this is to protect stupid users that might lose access due to a unintentionally malformed tx script.
I hope you don't get me wrong, I'm not against exploring alternative methods to deploy updates, I'm just conservatively considering the risks. A softfork is called a form for a reason, because the majority new software runners fork themselves from the old guys. That's why it's called "backwards compatible". However, when there is no clear majority, there is no notion of backward, because it's not sure which side of the fork will end up being considered the main one (trying not to use the word "win").
So the problem simply boils down to this:
in the non-SF chain, transaction using the NO_OP that the SF replaces are still valid (though non-standard and not mined by most miners), so miners that do include these transactions in their blocks will be pushed out of the network.

Most of those are just mining pools though. They don't have any hashpower. Currently they just have decision rights to that hash power that can be revoked at any time.
Pools don't matter that much when it comes to actual attacks on the network. Most mining companies (companies with hashrate) have a strong incentive to behave good. So if their pool goes rogue, they'll switch.
One small aspect in which pool centralization is dangerous currently is that a hacker only needs to take control over a few systems in order to do harm on the short term. Again, miners will switch, but on the short term it can cause disruption. The Chinese government could f.e. DoS the network. 
With Stratum v2 that decision making power will mostly be taken away, though. So the hack attack is no longer relevant. DoS by a state firewall can still be a thing, though. Even though with Stratum v2 most miners will have a solo-mining fallback so in that case the network will momentarily go full decentralized :D

Of course you do. Lightning Transactions are just like regular Bitcoin transactions, only they do not need to be put on the blockchain in normal operation.
The thing is, though that for LN to work efficiently, your "wallet", or client program, should be running all the time. So you will have to rely to a somewhat greater extend to service providers. There are some workarounds, though. But that's not a big deal as long as your keys are in your possession and the wallet provider cannot make payments without your consent.

What he means is that if you have 20 million in a bank account, you don't have 20 million. You don't even have an IOU from the bank for 20 million. Because when the bank goes bankrupt, you don't have a claim over that 20 million. It just vanishes.
So to have a reserve of 20 million, you'd need to either (1) have an 20 million balance with the central bank, but only banks are allowed to have balances with the central bank, or (2) have a balance of 20 million with a full-reserve bank (this is a bank that doesn't do fractional reserve banking and has full central bank reserves for all its outstanding balances).
Given that full-reserve banks are very rare nowadays, it's fair to say Tether isn't backed by reserves. At best it's backed by some bank balance equivalent with the tokens they issued. But that still means that the bankruptcy of that bank means a bankruptcy of Tether.

Hmm, well I'm not an economist, but I have some doubts with your assumptions.
 I don't think productivity is measured in money invested, but in hours worked. While more investment increases the number of hours worked, the other way around more hours worked also decreases the amount of investment. 
A productive country will employ a larger fraction of its population. Which means the population has more money and thus more money to spend, which will increase local prices.
Now, a lesser productive country (1) has lower wages because less people are employed and (2) have lower local prices because people have less money. This gives incentives for investment to flow towards these regions, because they have cheaper labor and resources. This will in turn increase employment and raise wages to balance this country against more productive countries.

Also it's totally possible to build this without custodial control over funds, btw. Especially without lightning (like OpenBazaar is today).

@_date: 2019-11-27 09:03:47
This is not true. Especially not if you disregard gold mining. In such an economy, value flows to the productive. So like you say unproductive countries will be poor and productive ones will be rich. But as soon as poor countries start being more productive, they will compete for the value. And the rich countries will need to stay highly productive to keep their wealth. Once they become less productive than other countries, their wealth will flow in their direction.
That is because unlike in our current economy, the strength of your economy (GDP) doesn't determine the value of your money. So the strength of your economy only gives you a momentary ability to gain wealth (in a neutral money), but that ability disappears richt when your economy slumps.

Personally, I see the Bitcoin blockchain itself only as a settlement system. It is just impossible to have a system that requires full history to be kept and use it for day-to-day transactions of billions of users.
However, there are ways to build lighter systems on top of Bitcoin that can be used as P2P cash. The one that comes to mind directly is the Lightning Network, of course. But there can also be others: f.e. a sidechain with fast confirmations and UTXO set commitments so that it does not require full history. 
Bottom line is, cryptography can do a lot of things and we're just getting started.

Yes, but I get 's point. SPV proofs are intended for thin clients to simplify verification. In the worst case, they can fool a thin client into thinking it has received something without it actually being true. But in the case of sidechains, they can be abused to steal actual on-chain coins.
Yet still, it would require all miners that are merge-mining the chain to accept the theft, but there's little other miners or users could do about that.

I don't agree that the miners are all that matters. The list of libraries and wallets that support it, should be a reference for a miner to start signaling.
What you don't want is a feature pushed by miners without support from wallets and libraries. So as long as too few of these are ready for segwit, I think miners do a good think delaying the launch.
Of course, you cannot make sure what miners are not signaling because they oppose the change and what miners are just waiting for more adoption before they will start signaling.
For now, I think the software is not there yet. You can see BitcoinJ, bitcoinjs, bitcore, btcsuite all signaling work-in-progress. Most wallets use one of these libraries. So as a miner, I would wait until at least most of those are ready for segwit.

I agree that Lightning is a general-purpose and open network while Liquid is a system managed by a federation. 
That's also why Liquid is primarily targeted to users that *already* have some trust in the members of the federation: traders. If you don't actively trade and just hold and spend your bitcoin, Liquid arguably gives no benefits (yet?). That might change f.e. when Liquid is integrated with Lightning and you can spend your anonymous L-BTC anywhere where Lightning is accepted.

Isn't your fiat money currently "on hold" in your checkings account?
It's really not that a strange idea. You should see your "Lightning Wallet", being the coins locked up in channels, as your checking account. You can get it out with a single on-chain transaction, but you can transact with it without requiring the blockchain. Besides, doesn't your checking account always have around the same amount of cash in it, just varying from the day your paycheck comes in and the day right before?
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:03:50
I agree with this. If you are in mining for the long term, solo mining should be advantageous since you don't pay the (though small) pool fee. Whats different from earning 5 BTC a day or 25 every 5 days. It's just about wanting to see the money come in.

A few remarks:
First. This way of Blind Merges Mining inherently limits the block generation speed of the sidechain to that of the mainchain. While in practice, especially as long as BMM is not widely adopted by mainchain miners, the effective block time of the sidechain blocks will be far lower.
This is very different from regular merged mining, where any Bitcoin block that has a proof-of-work attached that reaches the sidechain difficulty target, can be used for merged mining, even if it does not reach the mainchain difficulty target and never gets included in the mainchain.
Second. "Since side:spv-clients already must be main:spv-clients, the main:headers do not need to be stored an extra time."
Why would this be the case? All that an SPV client does is verify if the proof contains a sufficient amount of work. So a sidechain SPV client will need headers of both the main and the sidechain. It needs to mainchain headers to calculate the amount of work that is included and it needs the sidechain headers to verify if the provided mainchain headers correspond to sidechain blocks. These SPV clients need no connection to the Bitcoin network at all, and this will need all relevant data to be transferred for SPV verification.
Third. "One disadvantage to “blind merge mining”, is that if miners never validate sidechains at all, whoever bids the most for the chain (on a continuous basis), can spam a 3-month long stream of invalid headers, and then withdraw all of the coins deposited to the sidechain."
That is really a non-argument. The cost of creating 3 months worth of invalid blocks should be the defense measure against an attack. In any sidechain, even the regular PoW ones, you statement is equivalent to saying that whoever can 51% attack the network for 3 months can steal all the funds. This is an inherent property of sidechains. It's the job of the market to make sure the incentives are in place to prevent this. The more money resides in the sidechain, the higher the fees will have to become to make it secure.
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:03:53
A federation of currently 15 companies in the Bitcoin trading space sign blocks and hold joint custody of the coins in the Liquid network.
So basically every block in the network needs to be signed by 11/15 of them and for people to withdraw money out of it, 11/15 have to sign off. This means that for money to get stolen, 11 of the 15 companies need to work collaborate together to make an invalid withdrawal. On the other hand, 5 of the 15 together can put the network to a halt (f.e. when they are taken down by a DoS attack).
The devices used by these federation members are high-grade security devices with no remote access, custom offline hardware module for signing, ... that only and only verify blocks and verify withdrawals. 
The big conclusion is that primarily if you already hold your money on an exchange, it's a 100% upgrade in security because instead of your exchange to be hacked, 11 of them need to be hacked. That's why traders with their bitcoins on an exchange are our core target user group. However for other users it can also bring value with added confidentiality and faster block times.

The number of addresses you have is quite unrelated to security, but instead it's about privacy. If all your money is in one address, you leak your balance and all your transactions to everyone you financially interact with.
One could argue that bad privacy in combinations with large amounts of money is a o bad for your physical security, but as far as Bitcoin security goes, it's unrelated.
One thing that could potentially be a problem is reusing the same address more than one. You should probably avoid that mostly for privacy but also potentially security reasons.

Lightning Network does not prevent 24/7 borderless payments. I'm pretty sure as soon as LN has somewhat liquidity inside it, there will be services that let you instantly withdraw your coins by just sending it to them on the LN so that you can prevent the timelock.

There are a huge number of things that still need to be encapsulated into a seamless process for end users, even regular payments are far from user friendly in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin script is more limited than Ethereum's EVM, though. Don't get too excited. But it has more than just send to address etc. 
Most commonly in the Bitcoin world, is that people use script templates that are designed and vetted by experts and then people reuse. F.e. for the Lightning Network, they drafted some new templates and published them in the protocol spec. 
So it's less common to just start writing your own stuff, as is the case in Ethereum. But it is possible, and very interesting to learn :) 
One last note though: before you dig in the wiki page with all the op codes Bitcoin script has, a significant amount of them has been disabled. A safety decision a long time ago that is irreversible without a hardfork. But Segwit might be able to revive the old op codes. So always stay tuned :)

Miners first is not good. Here's why:
If miners process segwit transactions before all major wallets support them, wallets get incompatible. When my segwit-enabled wallet sends you a transaction, a segwit transactions, your segwit-not-yet-enabled wallet will not see it. So your wallet will be unable to receive it.
This is very dangerous. When different wallets are no longer able to understand each other, there is a serious problem. So as a miner, and as a community, it makes sense to avoid that scenario at all times and wait until everyone is fully ready for segwit.

Not a fork advocate at all, but this is a non-argument. If the only thing your fork adds is a change in the block size, you can perfectly rebase your client to Core's and have only a single line changed.

Total tx size (original TX + witness part) goes up a tiny bit, but practically stays the same. 
The difference is that the witness part weighs only a quarter of the original tx and is the biggest part of both usually. So of all txs in the block, the original txs size + 1/4 x the witness parts size must be lower than 1MB, thus more transactions fit.

Opening and closing a channel is done with an on-chain transaction. There is a miner fee, but you can adjust that fee of course by specifying the value of the output you take in the transaction.


While that might be the default case, it's not necessarily true. Interactively opening a channel by both putting in some money is possible. In the default scenario, though, you open a channel when you want to pay someone your existing channels can't reach. In that case you'll most likely be the only one putting some money into it.

I've spent an awful lot of time investigating and using the Ripple network (read: Master's Thesis) and even though they do support routing natively, it almost never finds the best route while it uses an awful not of resources on their C++ client. So I'd not say Ripple has routing already figured out entirely. A friend of mine developed a custom Ripple routing algorithm that finds lucrative paths out of thin air (make money by exploiting existing offers and trust lines that are just there for you to connect with each other), just to make clear that there is still a lot of space for improvement.
@_date: 2016-11-07 11:37:59
I believe most alternative implementations support getblocktemplate.
If it would be risky for miners to mine with alternative implementations, it is also risky for users to use them, which is not a healthy ecosystem. That argument alone should be enough for users to ask miners to use these implementations. It is bad that there is so much power in the hands of Core. If they make a controversial change in the client together with important security upgrades, miners will be forced to accept the controversial change.

One important difference is that large miners can artificially add any amount of fake transactions to their blocks to make it harder for smaller miners to keep up.

For that to be true, would require it to be possible to find the nonce value from `utxo_lookup(H(header||nonce))`. So it should probably be `H(header||nonce||H(utxo_lookup(H'(header||nonce)))` with `H'` being a non-cryptographic, deperministic hash function. Or am I mistaken?

Running a fork would indeed be a possibility and a good one too. However I think maintaining further updates in forks can be a messy job :p
In this regard, I actually found it strange that everyone was so pumped up with the lightning fast adoption of v0.13.1. In the matter of days, more than 50% of the network and (IIRC) of miners too. I would be more assured if it would have taken a few weeks. Miners should review changes, see if others don't run into trouble, let alternative implementations keep up, ...
The BIP9 upgrade system is quite a good thing here. It allows pushing updates without immediately activating them, which gives me some peace of mind :)

But it's normal that not all miners stop signaling the block after the activation.

Uhm, you can just generate a block template alongside a no-segwit block template. I'm not suggesting for miners to actually mine these templates, that makes no sense...
You can just run a parallel node that has segwit artificially turned on and it will generate segwit blocks ready to be mined. These blocks could be put up somewhere (doesnt even have to be a miner) to be compared with standard blocks. Tx amount-wise, size-wise and fee-wise

There would be no problem at all. Especially with an uncontentious and adequately early announced one, where both participants in a Lightning channel update their (backend and ln) software to know about the fork.
If the fork is somewhat contentious, it all depends on what chain your channel counterparties are following. I'm not sure LN software has logic for this, though. But if your counterparts are on the same chain, nothing happens, really. If they are not, you could try to close a channel on the chain your counterpart is not on and claim your money there or try to claim more money than you own in the channel.
Other than that, really nothing much happens.

You can certainly do your part in building the Bitcoin and lightning networks. But don't expect to earn anything for it. It'll be for your own good of being a validating participant in the network. Consider it altruism.
I think you are confused by two things:
First, it's true that Bitcoin nodes verify transactions, but they don't earn fees. The fees are rewarded to the miners. These are special nodes that attach proof-of-work to the blocks of transactions they validate. To generate this proof-of-work, you don't need a regular datacenter, but specialized bitcoin mining hardware.
Second, you might have heard that being a routing note earns you fees. This is true in theory, but (1) it requires you to put up some capital in Bitcoin into your node, not just to run the software and (2) the fees will not cover your costs. To start doing this, you'll need to make some Bitcoin transactions where you'll have to pay fees as well. The Lightning fees you earn will most probably not cover these Bitcoin fees.

I agree with your statement, even though I think you put it a bit too forcefully.
The baseline is that every person using Bitcoin can enforce it's own rules and will only be able to transact with people whose rules do not contradict these rules. This means indeed that even though the majority of the miners push a change, it can never be forced upon users that do not accept the change.
This is a very important principle that is often overlooked when talking about consensus in the light of governance of the protocol rules that make Bitcoin. This is, also, the reason why Bitcoin Core has been trying, and succeeding, to implement all changes to the protocol as soft-forks. These changes allow people that agree on them to use them, but they do not contradict the ruleset of the more conservative nodes (read: older ones). For more controversial changes, this is an incredibly important feature.

I think you understand it a bit wrong. In every block, miners get (1) all the fees of the txs in the block and (2) an additional reward. So the only thing that will change is that the additional reward will become 0.
You say "when the last block is mined", that doesn't exist. There is no last block. Just at the last halvening the reward will go from 1 satoshi per block to 0. And then all coins are mined.
But mining just goes on. People pay pay fees for their transactions and miners that mine blocks will still get the fees from the transactions they mine.
So what people are currently thinking or hoping that will happen is that the total value of fees in a block in the future will be roughly similar to the current value of (1) the fees in a block and (2) the reward. This generally means that people acknowledge that tx fees will become larger.

@_date: 2019-06-24 11:13:41
I assume that you understand hashing, public key crypto, merkle roots and the fact that with Schnorr you can add two public keys (A &amp; B, f.e.) together to get a 2-of-2 multisignature pubic key (which we will call AB).
So the basic principle you need to know for these is called pay-to-contract. From a high level it's quite simple: there is a way to mathematically hide a hash inside a public key, called a commitment, and later-on proof that you committed to that hash (and only that hash).
If you don't proof your committed hash, the public key and any signature generated for it look like any other regular signature, so it's impossible to tell that pay-to-contract was used for a given public key. You can only proof afterwards, by revealing the hash, that you hid in there.
So to go one step at the time, let's invent "scriptroot". Let's say we want to have a script for the condition "Alice and Bob sign or Alice signs after 100 blocks". This condition has two possible executions: "Alice and Bob sign" and "Alice signs after 100 blocks". With scriptroot we will do the following, we take the script clause that we can reduce to a single (multi-)signature: "Alice and Bob sign" which is equal to "a signature from the public key AB". So the other clause we can write as a single script "Alice signs after 100 blocks".
So what we will do with "scriptroot": we will hide the hash of "Alice signs after 100 blocks" inside the public key `AB`, which will give us public key `AB'`. And we will send money to a special "scriptroot" output with public key `AB'`.
If we want to spend this money, we can either create a signature for `AB'` which Alice and Bob can generate by signing with their keys `A` and `B`. Or in the case were Bob is not cooperating, Alice can wait 100 blocks and then reveal the script "Alice signs after 100 blocks" and proof that this script was hidden in `AB'`. She is then allowed to provide inputs to fulfill the script (i.e .her signature).
All other nodes can verify the pay-to-contract commitment inside the public key `AB'` which was in the output Alice is trying to spend and they can verify that Alice is fulfilling the script.
So this is basically taproot, except that in taproot, instead of committing to a single script like we did in "scriptroot", you can commit to an arbitrary number of scripts. The hash that you hide in the public key is the merkle root of all the possible scripts and when you want to spend, you have to provide a proof that your script is somewhere inside the merkle tree of the commitment.
Graftroot goes another level further. Instead of commiting to a merkle tree of scripts, you commit to a new public key called the "delegation public key". For spending, you are allowed to provide any script as long as it is signed with the delegation public key. This means that it's even possible to create new spending conditions after the output is already in the blockchain, but it also means that if you lose the signatures of the delegation public key for the scripts, you can no longer use those scripts.
Taproot is proposed in the [taproot]( [BIP proposal]( Graftroot is only theoretical for now. The benefit of all these techniques is that the public network doesn't learn any information from seeing your outputs. Currently, all Lightning outputs are very easily to identify. It's also pretty easy to see if you're using a multisig wallet or a wallet that has a timeout clause. Since there aren't so many such wallets, it's possible to pinpoint what software you're using. With taproot outputs, this information is revealed only in the unlikely case where you have to use your script instead of just creating a cooperative signature. Another benefit is that these scripts, which can get a bit large when doing lightning for example, don't need to be put in a transaction anymore, which means that transactions can be smaller.

First of all, it's not going to be 0 anytime within the year after the tx.
Ultimately it's up to both parties to decide if they want to make the trade. It's happening right now, so it appears that people are fine with the deal. A seller will either have coins that he wants to spend directly instead of selling first in order to spend later. (F.e. to avoid fees, taxes or to gain more financial privacy.) The buyer will probably be OK with taking the gamble that the price will be either stable or go up in the short term after the trade. He could also have additional benefits like avoiding fees from credit card companies, having no risk of a charge-back or again having more financial privacy.

While you're right that it's possible to represent a private key using the same mnemonic system as BIP39, it's not possible to do this within the BIP39 or BIP32 standard.
BIP39 describes a way to go from 256-bit entropy to a phrase and from the phrase to a seed. You can't go from the seed back to the phrase. Then there is a standard to go from the seed to the BIP32 master key and start your key tree.

There is no official thing like a "sat/byte" fee. It's not like the gasprice in Ethereum. It's just a prioritizing mechanism that a lot of miners use because they want to maximize their profits.
Next to that , bitcoin has specific limits on f.e. the amount of signature verification. There might become a limit on the number of CT range proof checks as well.
Pure game theory wise, a miner is incentivized to make its blocks as CPU intensive per byte as possible, because it will require its competitors to verify the block first before they can start mining on the next block (though many/all do right away while verifying), giving them a slight advantage in the race.

It could be a thing f.e. if we had a repository where everyone, but mainly prominent figures like Core developers etc, could post signatures of bootstrap files or just plain block hashes. With block hashes, you'd still have to download and build the UTXO set by "executing" all transactions. But you wouldn't have to do signature verifications.
Such an organised effort of collecting signatures of "trusted" parties can be dangerous though. People tend to become lazy and the number of signatures one would personally require would narrow to a small number naturally. And then there would be a honey pot of just a small number of people that could infect and disrupt new users.

This could very much be a malicious browser extension that knows of websites where it can import private keys like blockchain.info and just seeds the private key with anything it can find in the page or a previously visited page (like any other address, hash, ...).
Browser extensions are very dangerous as they are very powerful and no one verifies their behaviour. It scares me a lot that so many "secure wallet solutions" like both Trezor and Ledger only have web-based clients that are vulnerable to this kind of trickery.
EDIT: Just to address some comments, while I am mostly concerned about non-hardware web wallets, hardware wallets are not entirely safe. I'm aware that hardware wallets have internal key management so browser software cannot mess with keys. What it can do is inject a different destination address. I bet a part of the users only verifies the amount displayed. Others probably also only the first 2-3 characters of the destination address. Injection software can create a wrong address and send that to the wallet instead, finding an address with the same first 3 characters is not that hard, even in browsers.

You're missing a crucial point. Why would someone hold/own a stablecoin?
For the vast majority of payments, cash or debit card payments in the equivalent currency will be cheaper, faster and more convenient. So if I have euros that work well for payments, why would I need euro-stablecoins?
The difference with Bitcoin is that there is a financial incentive to hold Bitcoin over holding euros. That's the only driver for new payments tech for Bitcoin. Since people will want to hold Bitcoin, we want to provide these holders with a way to use the currency they hold.
Stablecoins are a great way to circumvent KYC and trade in unregulated markets like dEXes. But I don't see much other value in them.

There are two possible time expectations for payments IMO: time-critical ones and non-time-critical ones. In the former, your payment must succeed in less than ~3 seconds: retail, online purchases etc. In the latter, you really don't care. Tomorrow is fine.
So whether it's 6 confirmations or 2, or even 1, it doesn't matter. It doesn't fit the first time expectation category.
Whenever I send on-chain funds (i.e. rarely), I just check back tomorrow.

Your study doesn't make much sense, though.
You can't compare 2,500 usd and 0.33219732 BTC. Since no one has round balances in their account, there is clearly only 2 significant digits in 2,500 usd. So it should be compared with 0.33 BTC. Of course the extra decimals scare users. 2,528.49 usd is already a lot worse as well.
Same goes with 5.50: also clearly 2 significant digits. 0.00091 BTC is better than 0.00091232. With the same amount of significant digits, people will more intuitively realize that it's *just* a scale issue.

@_date: 2019-12-18 08:38:18
It does. If you solve a PoW that would need 1000 tries on average in 1 second, I know you have 1000 hashes per second.
But if the network together solves 100 hashes that need 60,000 hashes with an average block time of 1 minute, why can't we say the average hashrate of the network is 1000 hashes per second?
No one ever says it's an exact hashrate. It's an estimated hashrate. One block could have been found with fewer hashes, another with more.

When there is a dispute in a Lightning Channel, they have to be settled on the blockchain. This happens by broadcasting the most recent state of the channel to the network and having it confirmed in a block.
A malicious participant can however broadcast an older state to the blockchain that gives him more money than he deserves. The Lightning Network is designed as such that when an attacker does this, the honest counterparty can broadcast another transaction that proofs that the first one was malicious and that punishes the attacker and gives all the money to the honest party.
Now, this proof needs to be provided within a certain time aka number of blocks. If it's not provided within X blocks, the malicious party gets his way.
So the attack Vitalik describes is that when an attacker closes a fuckton of channels maliciously at the same time, all the honest parties must send their fraud proofs in the next X blocks. If the number of channels closed maliciously is bigger than the space in the next X blocks for fraud proof transactions, now all honest parties can have their fraud proof tx confirmed in time.
Note that first, such an attack costs a very big amount of prep cost in tx fees. Second, for every fraud proof that *does* get confirmed, the attacked loses all his money in the channel, so he will probably only try to do this with channels on which his balance is 0 (this can be a flag for you to close the channel beforehand or rebalance it). And third, you (or your Lightning Wallet) decides on a number of X that you are comfortable with.
The number X, the number of blocks within which a fraud proof must be published, is a trade-off between the time it takes to fully settle a channel and the chance of falling victim of such an attack. Since Lightning channels should not have to be closes all thst often, a very big value for X is reasonable. If X is ~a day or up to a week worth of blocks, you should be safe.

@_date: 2019-04-18 08:16:34
Correct. So if you have an unconfirmed chain, you simply either (1) pay a higher fee on the new tx you add to the chain (and Child-Pays-For-Parent will make your package worth more) or (2) bump the fee on your last transaction using Replace-By-Fee (and CPFP will also make your package worth more).
However I think these systems usually try to aggregate their operations to just make one batch tx per block or something. So you're not gonna have huge unconfirmed chains.

I'm quite sure miners won't mine zero-fee transactions because the mempool is never empty like it used to be a long time ago. So while lower-than-one-sat fees might get confirmed, I don't think a zero-fee transaction would. There might be a ton of nodes relaying it, it's just silly for a miner to mine it while there are non-zero-fee txs to mine instead.
On Bitcoin Cash on the other hard where the mempool is always empty, sure.
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:46:14
Good question! That is exactly what happens. In fact, a modern ASIC tries all the possible nonce values in a few seconds.
Partly as a solution to this issue, years ago an "extranonce" was introduced. This is a random value in the coinbase input. The input of the coinbase transaction can hold any data, so it can easily be altered. So when a miner has tried all nonce values, he can change the extranonce, recalculate the merkle root and start over.
In fact, mining protocols like Stratum give miners the partial merkle tree they need to efficiently recalculate the merkle root when updating the extranonce.
Also, in the last year or two, miners have been starting to play with other bits in the block header to be able to try more hashes without having to update the extranonce. It's called nTime-rolling and version-rolling. Respectively slightly modifying the timestamp and version fields so that the header stays valid.

We don't really need full-reserve banks. The reason why commercial banks co-exist with central banks is because the central bank couldn't manage all the gold of all the citizens of a country. It's a huge administrative task it just delegated to comercial banks.
In our current world with modern technology, a central bank can totally issue a digital money centrally. This would allow ordinary citizens to hold actual central bank money without needing a third party like a commercial bank.
We don't even need Bitcoin or blockchain for this. Chaumian e-cash would totally work for central banks to adopt. It's private and scalable.
We all know why it doesnt exist. Governments would lose control over money and big banks would lose profits they now have because of their monopoly on owning central bank money. Power corrupts.

I saw a lot of off-topic replies. I think the gist of your question is answered by saying that you can just spend your unconfirmed change outputs. If there is no reason why that change output will never be confirmed, there is no reason to not use it as an input in your next tx.
Relevant to this, there is a strategy called Child Pays For Parent (CPFP). When miners select transactions to include in a block, they will want the ones with the highest fee. However, miners that follow the CPFP strategy (most do), will also look at transactions spending outputs for a transaction. 
So let's say you have an unconfirmer tx A with change output C that has a low fee and you want to spend this change output because you don't have unconfirmed change. You can create tx B that spends C and. If you are afraid your tx A will not get confirmed (which would prevent tx B from getting confirmed as well), you can give tx B a higher-than-average fee. Miners look at "packages" of txs, these are txs that have dependencies between them. So A and B will be one package because B can't be confirmed without A. Because of CPFP, miners will look at the total fee of A+B for that package. So basically, the parent tx B is paying partly the miner fee to confirm tx A.
In fact, some of the software dealing with txs like this, including the Liquid pegout software, will try to just maintain a single UTXO. It can do so by always spending their previous UTXO and adding extra inputs when they receive incoming txs. That way, they never have to be worried about more than one tx to get confirmed. And they can increase their fees on new txs when their chain stays unconfirmed for too long.

Bitcoin is definitely none of these things.
- While it's a lot more stable than it used to be, it's still really unstable compared to other reserve assets. 5% price swings in a single day are just a no-go in this context.
- Liquidity, really? Reserve currencies are to be traded on public markets. Name me one public market where I can make a 10 million USD trade without causing a &gt;0.1% price change in the order book. I didn't run the numbers, but I'm convinced you can't. While liquidity is high for where we are currently, it's definitely not anywhere near it needs to be for global market players to adopt it.
- Be used globally. No one uses Bitcoin globally. I don't believe there is a single big company (turnover of day 100 million USD a year) that actually uses Bitcoin. Of course this excludes mining or receiving payments in Bitcoin and exchanging shortly after.
What a shitty article.

I understand your concern. What I've been thinking mostly is that a full two-way peg requires a big change to Bitcoin and the Core dev space it currently quite occupied with another big change that they have to worry about.
Allowing an OPCODE for SPV proof verification does not only require a quite complex extension to the script system, there must also be put a lot of thought in the PoW requirements for sidechains and how to make that generic.
Merged-mined sidechains use the same kind of PoW, that's fairly straightforward, but we'd want sidechains with other PoW mechanisms as well, like Ethereum f.e.

Not a fact. Government and big corporations can still borrow by selling bonds. Also, people with excess savings will put their money in investment accounts where it's locked for a certain time like 1-5 yrs. Banks can then lend out this money at a premium by taking the counterparty risk.
I'm 27 and I remember these kind of things existing when I was 15. "term deposits" and "state obligations" were extremely common only 15 years ago. They would work perfectly in a full-reserve banking system.
Banks can totally be full-reserve. A bank is something that stores something. Personally I think banks shouldn't be allowed to borrow money, we should have specialized commercial institutions for that. Banks should be for payments and savings.
The government currently gives a monopoly status to special companies who's business model is purely risking ordinary citizens' savings. It should end.

From what I understood Craig claimed that he and Kleiman had a ton of BTC. Don't remember but either he was suing MtGox to get them or he already has them. 
Then Kleiman's family used his public claim of that money or his public statements that he has that money as a proof for the court to claim they half of it belongs to them, Kleiman's heirs.
So basically by somehow officially stating that he has those coins, Craig got himself a lawsuit to pay back half of them.
So now Craig either has to confess for the court that he lied and doesn't have the money, or needs to pay half a million bitcoin to Kleiman's family.

Matt Corallo (et al?) made a proposal some time ago for a second generation mining protocol that brings mining power back from the pools to the miners. It's dubbed BetterHash. There is a BIP and an implementation IIRC. 
It's a very good start. Pools should only do distribution of the block reward instead of getting full power over their miners' hashrate. That's what BetterHash is providing.
On another topic, there were several newcomers in the ASIC manufacturing space over the last year. That's very good news. At some point, efficiency improvements will stagnate and it will become easier to enter the market.

There is nothing odd about that. People like to put orders at round numbers and the larger the outstanding offers or an amount, the longer it will take to move past that amount price, especially when buying pressure is low.
So what happened it a guy or two put some very high sell orders on 600, exactly, so it took several people buying at 600 in order for the price to move up.

Usually big auctions go for above the market price. When you try to accumulate that many coins from the market, the price will rise and you will have to go through some exchanges etc.
The ease of buying them at once without having to trust an exchange and waiting for market liquidity is why you pay a premium.

There is very strict regulation on what banks own for their customers. There are laws that explicitly allow a bank to have more money outstanding than their reserves in the central bank. The factor difference is also very explicitly regulated. 
So yes, if a bank is supposed to have a certain amount of bitcoins or any other non-fiat instruments for their customers, they will have it or they will lose their banking license. That is until laws are created to allow fractional reserve Bitcoin holding. But I don't think we're anywhere near something like that.
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:02:58
I would estimate that number a lot lower.
First of all I think most customers don't have money at all. Either accounts that never had activity or people thst took their coins off the exchange.
Then second of all, they had gigantic spikes in new sign-ups during the big price hikes last year. So at the 20k price level, buying a whole bitcoin was not thst cheap. Those people might have bought a few 100 or 1000 worth, not a whole coin. And most of those also sold again later and left crypto behind.
I'd not estimate more than 5%. Probably even less.

Since the outputs they create are so small, they inevitable have to be combined with other UTXOs when spending.
This could very well be someone trying to deanonymize certain addresses by sending coins to a bunch of them and hoping the owner makes a spend that spends two of the small UTXOs which will link two of the addresses together.
Given that you already showcase your address here in public, I guess you don't care about deanonymization. But still, the analytics companies working with exchanges could still identify you as a person of they can link your UTXOs with the ones you withdraw from an exchange.

There is very strict regulation on fractional reserve banking with fiat money. I don't believe it's currently legal for a bank to use the same fractional reserve strategy with other kinds of instruments they hold for their customers.
And banks are quite heavily watched and regulated when it comes to ensuring they can't declare ownership of things they don't actually have. So unless there come new laws allowing fractional reserve keeping of bitcoins, I don't think they can right now.

Good point, let me make a quick summary of possible actions in the README.
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:47:23
The attack just wants people (we can't know who they target, but might just be the whole blockchain to test their clustering heuristics) to reveal two or more UTXOs/addresses that they both own.
When you send a small amount of money to an address that is associated with one UTXO, the owner will have to spend this small amount together with another UTXO (unless the unlikely case he wants to send an amount even smaller than the received amount). So if that other UTXO is associated with another address, they have revealed a link between these two addresses.
So depends on how you spend their money. If you spent it together only with UTXOs that have the same address associated with it, they don't gain any more information than they otherwise would. If you consolidated this tiny UTXO with another of your (small) UTXOs, their "attack" succeeded.

You're missing the point here. In your explanation, people got screwed when using the B2X chain, not when using the real bitcoin mainchain. So," the whole thing" being broken is only B2X, not Bitcoin.
That's actually a pretty good thing for us, since using B2X will be a nightmare, but when using Bitcoin without caring about B2X will not be affected. So that's what people most likely will be doing. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:03:21
From the top of my head, if all txs only pay the lowest fee included in the block, that would partly break the out-of-band fee mechanism, though. It basically forces miners to either have all their fees out-of-band and discard all official fees they can get, or use the official fee schedule. Txs that pay the fee out-of-band will have 0 official fee, which will disregard all profits from the official fee mechanism for the whole block.
Another problem I see with the monopolistic price mechanism is that it only works for full mempools. When the mempool is not very full, there will be a lot of low-fee txs and miners will be incentivized to not include them, not filling up blocks. Zero-fee (of very-low-fee) txs will basically never get into a block, even if there is excess block space available. (Even though they mention they only focus on *impatient users*, that really want their tx in the next block.)

I don't have a lot of time to go in depth here, but a simple and straightforward problem is adoption. It's a hard fork. All the wallets, users and businesses that did not upgrade their software will be operating in an alternative dimension and being banned from the "Bitcoin" network without even realising it. Doing a non-backwards compatible software upgrade needs to happen over a very long period of time, because people are reluctant to upgrades by nature. See the recent problems with tons of companies still using Windows XP.
I want to add one thing


That is a common misconception. The expression "the most work wins" is a heuristic for block selection **within the same network/ruleset**. If a new client joins the network and it receives two different chains with valid blocks (of which one is from an attacker), it uses that metric to guess what is the actual main chain.
The "most work wins" argument doesn't apply to chains with a different ruleset (i.e. hard forks) though. That would make no sense. You say


There are a lot of BIPs I can come up with that the miners would be glad to all adopt and start mining if the rule would actually be that any chain with more work would win. This can go from a BIP a la "all unspent transaction outputs older than X blocks (say 2 years) are rewarded to the miner of the block" to more extreme BIPs like "we introduce a new checkpoint at block XXXX at which the entire UTXO set is reset into the following one: ...".
Those changes make no sense of course, but if "the chain with the most work wins" would be the rule everyone adheres to, that is what miners would be able to pull off. Both chains would have the same genesis block, and the headers would be valid and represent DSHA256 work like we all know it. The only difference with the S2X hard fork is the scope of the rule changes. You don't want to give miners a signal that it's ok for them to take a finger. Before you know it, they take the whole hand.

It's actually `RIPEMD160(SHA256(SHA256(`.
Bitcoin uses double sha256 everywhere, mining is also double. Somehow Satoshi thought that would be a good idea and other than that you have to remember to do it twice, it doesn't really change much. Then RIPEMD160 is used because it has a shorter hash value. Sha256 has 256-bit hashes (32 bytes), while RIPEMD160 has, you guess it, 160-bit hashes (20 bytes). So in order not to have too long addresses and to save some space in the outputs, the shorter hash is used as the address.

It a indeed possible to have a lot of nodes, but you can only gain some information if one of your nodes is at the start or end of the payment route. And then you only gain half of the information.

Ethereum smart contracts have something to it. They are not scalable and they probably won't survive for long-lasting and highly adopted services. But it has a big dev community and has created a fuckton of enthousiasm in the mainstream tech and fintech world.
So IMO on the short term, RSK is very excited. Developing for Bitcoin is a lot harder than for the EVM. A lot of devs are heavily interested in Ethereum, but they miss a currency with value. So they might pick up RSK as an easy alternative. It brings them closer to Bitcoin and might get them interested in other Bitcoin techs like LN, MW, ...

Yeah in a situation where OOB fees are common (which is likely for the future, especially if new schemes increase incentives for it), there are a lot of options.
But they usually require a high level of coordination between miners and transactors. As long as an non-interactive OOB scheme is hard, it's hard to say what will happen. If mining will be very centralized, OOB fees can do a lot more damage, but of we manage to keep mining more decentralized, I think there will always be smaller miners that keep relying on the official fee system. But like you mention, `OP_TRUE`-like txs already provide a non-interactive way to avoid the official fee system though.
I think that when considering the effects of interactive OOB fees, it must be taken into account that there will be a competition between OOB miners and smaller miners that cannot take OOB fees interactively. F.e. in schemes that enforce a certain minimum fee based on a moving average the OOB miners will decrease the fee while the others will increase it (even though OOB miners might actually try to increase it as well and refund their users OOB in order to make non-OOB more expensive). A solution where both parts have an equal way to influence the status-quo in their benefit might be acceptable, but they would make miner centralization even more of a dangerous situation.

All I'm saying is that if RSK Labs launches one where they take 15% of the fee, the community will most likely try to launch a community-driven one where all fees go to miners.

The thing is all miners run a full node but not all full nodes are mining. A lot of regular users run full nodes and most Bitcoin companies also do.
A full node makes you verify your incoming transactions yourself instead of trusting someone else to do it for you. It's a pretty good thing for any user.

In short: off-chain solutions protect network centralization because they help keep the need for block space low.
The bigger the blockchain, the more costly it is to run the software to maintain it and keep up with new transactions. Both disk space and bandwidth requirements increase with the block size. At every block size there is people that cannot afford to maintain a full node and with every increase the requirements tighten.
It is important to understand that some stakeholders gain when others are no longer able to maintain a node. When smaller miners and competed out of the network the bigger miners gain in their hashrate share. So the problem with every dynamic block size solution is that miners can freely include transactions in their blocks (the fees get paid to themselves anyway) and make them arbitrarily big, making it look like there is demand. When this increases the block size automatically, they can basically increase it forever until all smaller miners can no longer compete.
So again, basically, off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network help offload pressure off the blockchain.
Other than that, they have mostly superior properties with regard to user experience, like better anonymity, faster payments (instant) and lower fees.

Has little to do with testing. Because any two parties can make payments independently of each other. Even if an individual lightning client (like for a shop) would not be very fast, there can be an unlimited amount of them. And note that a single lnd node has already been shown to process hundreds of payments per second. 
It's like asking how fast people can download from BitTorrent. One person is limited by its internet speed, but all users together can reach an accumulated download speed that is uncountably big.

You are quoting price levels Bitcoin should reach in order for miners to get the same income as now. That makes no sense, Satoshi intentionally created the block bounty to bootstrap adoption, not as a long-term way to finance security.
While bounties will drop in the future, so will the cost of mining equipment. The physical limit of hashrate will soon be reached and then I believe the cost per hashrate will stabilize. This means that everyone can enter the market on the same foot, you don't need a favor from a manufacturer to make profits.
The result, a lot more people and institutions will start running mining nodes. They don't have the danger of buying mining equipment that's obsolete in a year, so it's a long term investment to participate in a system you are depending on. I see a lot more decentralized future this way.

Privacy is indeed a frequently overseen feature of Lightning. And it has been a major focus while working out the protocol. Currently, Lightning payments are routed in a similar fashion as Tor traffic, meaning that only the endpoints of the transaction, sender and receiver, know what is going on and all the middlemen have no idea. They just forward the package having no knowledge about the sender and the receiver of the payment they are helping to facilitate.

TumbleBit is like Lightning. It's compatible with today's Bitcoin features. It's a second layer.
Mimblewimble is like confidential transactions to the extreme. It basically rethinks the whole system, so personally I don't think it'll ever be adopted into Bitcoin, because it would change almost everything, consensus-wise.
So round-up: lightning and tumblebit are possible today, although they probably require segwit to be efficient/reasonably implementable (not entirely sure for tumblebit). While CT and MW are far into the future things.

In fact, one of the main misconceptions with non-bitcoiners is that you have to buy a whole bitcoin at once. "2000 euros?? I don't want to invest that!" 
How about for every euro, you get 500 bits
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:36:27
Well, you can already do that if you really want to. There are mixing services abound and things like CoinJoin or TumbleBit.
Lightning will also greatly improve privacy, since transactions no longer need to be broadcast to the whole network and will just be between you and the seller. CT and MW make on-chain transactions private, off-chain transactions are kinda private by definition, since they don't appear in any public chain.

First of all, you swapped the requirement. It's says Segwit when 80% support and hard form hard deadline 6 months, regardless of support. 
Since Jihan is opposed to Segwit and he controls ~40% of the hash rate (see BU signaling), the 80% threshold will not be reached. So Segwit will most probably not be deployed. 
Also, a hardfork in 6 months is crazy. A hardfork to be safely deployed requires supermajority support of the network, read 95% or more. (BIP9 uses 95% as a threshold for safe soft-forks deployment) 
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:02:01

Well, it is not decentralized and distributed in the way Bitcoin is, but it has a level of decentralization. You basically specify your unique node list (UNL) to contain known parties that you trust not to collude against the rest of the network (in Bitcoin you trust the majority of the hash power not to do that). The first problem of course, and it was never solved, was that Ripple itself was the only company actually maintaining some (ridiculously expensive) validating nodes and the software shipping with Ripple's node as the default ones. This made the software effectually centralized.
But I know too that the UNL model failed and is not robust, despite the claims in the [RPCA paper]( (I read it, but wasn't too familiar with the theory to judge the BGP math they threw at you). People having a non-default UNL that did not only include Ripple's nodes could easily split off from the network.

RTC are basically bitcoins that are on the Rootstock sidechain. The two way peg allows "transfer" of BTC to RTC and vice-versa. 
So, miners that both mine Bitcoin and Rootstock will receive BTC from Bitcoin blocks and RTC from Rootstock blocks. Because Rootstock is merged mined with the Bitcoin block chain, it takes negligible additional work to mine Rootstock when you are already mining Bitcoin. So, assuming that Rootstock users provide a decent amount of fees, miners that also mine Rootstock would earn more money overall.

Even though you're mostly right that it makes no sense to signal something you don't have implemented yet, UASF is not a formal signaling process. There's not version bit, the uacomment signal just expresses support for the idea of user activated soft-forks. (This is a general term btw, should not necessarily be tied to bip 148.)
Anyways, Segwit support is going through the last phase of reviews and should land soon. After that, any Segwit-related bip can be implemented relatively easily.

The Ripple Consensus Ledger, the cryptocurrency network known as "Ripple" (not to be confused with Ripple Inc, the company that developed the protocol and that also has other projects) was intended as an IOU network with native issued tokens. Companies and banks can issue money in the network and market makers can announce offers between any issue pair. 
This allows users of the Ripple network to make payment from any issue (currency + issuer) to another, by finding a route in the graph of offers by market makers. Ripple transaction times are about 3 seconds for full validation.
XRP, the [native token]( of the network, was intended to have two usages:
1. an anti-spam mechanism. Transactions cost fees in XPR and in order to have open balances of "trust lines" with issuers, users had to temporarily lock up some XRP too. So basically, all information held in the network was payed for with XRP, making it the utility instrument of the network.
2. as an intermediate currency. Since it is not very likely that there will by market makers between all issue pairs and to avoid high fees by having to make payment routes with a lot of hops, Ripple also hoped that market makers would make markets between issues and XRP instead of between issue pairs directly. That way, users could always find a two-hop payment route (sender issue &lt;-&gt; XRP &lt;-&gt; receiver issue). For this reason, XRP is made very small-grained. They made 100 billion of them and the smallest unit (a drop) has 6 decimals, giving XRP 10^17 units, compared to Bitcoin's ~10^15.
EDIT: It might be worth noting that the Ripple Consensus Ledger was designed to be a cryptocurrency-like network that would involve different parties and not rely on centralized trust. However, Ripple Inc is currently still maintaining the majority of the [validator nodes]( The Ripple network has always been criticised for not having the same trust model as Bitcoin, even though it still has a very different trust model than traditional financial institutions.

There are softforks/hardforks whenever a change is to be made to the consensus system. And only then. Why? Because consensus is the only thing that the whole network has to agree on. All other things are dependent on the implementation of the protocol and can be freely chosen.
The Lightning Network is totally independent of consensus. It is a second layer that uses Bitcoin smart contracts to magically make instant transactions possible. Since they just **use** existing (after segwit at least) parts of the bitcoin protocol, no "voting" is needed. Nothing changes in consensus. 
Confidential Transactions are an entirely different beast. CT changes a lot of core Bitcoin pieces. Instead of transaction amounts being encoded in transactions (like what's the case right now), they will be blinded. That's a pretty drastic change to the consensus part of the network. You can imagine this as everyone knowing how to read and write numbers like 1337 or 42, and suddenly Alice tells you she wants to send Bob "随机 BTC". No one understands that, so it is of course impossible for the network to reach consensus over things they don't understand.
So yes, Confidential Transactions are very much a feature that needs a soft or hard fork. A very drastic one too. It's theoretically possible to implement CT in a soft fork, but don't expect it to happen anytime soon. SegWit was already a pretty drastic consensus change, and you can see how long it takes for the network to accept it.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:41:08
Thanks, it's a minor change, though. The code base is of really high quality, very well structured, if you program in Go, it's really worth taking a look at.

I don't believe so. I run a node and it takes like a week to sync up to the point of today. That is with almost empty blocks for the first half of the time. That's 420 GB a year, raw blocks without any metadata. That also means 8x bandwidth increase and validation load. At that speed, validating from an HDD is probably not very feasible anymore, so a 500GB SSD a year more to fill.
That's a high price to pay just to own money. Remember Bitcoin is not a payment system, it's a way to store money: every user that wants to just own some of it has to run the software to make sure he doesn't get stolen from.

That's not the same because that number is not fixed, nor publicly known by everyone and from the beginning of the issuance.
Since we all know the 21 million figure and we know it will be almost entirely going around is the near future, it makes sense to just consider that the total amount outstanding, even though it not (yet) is. With USD, this number arbitrarily changes every year and there is not way for anyone to know what it's gonna be next year.

I like this! The motivation makes a lot of sense. Wallets/service providers can provide delayed transactions easily, but that would require the service to stay online for the users or for other wallets and service providers to pick up formats from out-of-business competitors. A unified standard for these kinds of scenarios is a lot more sustainable and safe! 
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:12:01
Correct. A "fork" is not a very correct term if it's only a single block. You can yourself fork anytime you want, but it's highly unlikely that anyone will accept your block, so you'll have your own private fork, pretty meaningless. 
In the current situation though, since most nodes don't enforce BIP91, most nodes will accept the block. Miners that run BIP91, however will not and will not mine on top of your fork. So the main chain will quickly catch up. But that still means that a large part of the network is vulnerable to seeing 1-confirmation transactions being reverted in 10-3 minutes. Which is of course not very ideal. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:15:43
Remember that the only people running BIP91 code are BIP91 signalers. I very much consider the possibility that some major pools decide to not signal segwit (really signal, on bit 1) on the last moment.
Otherwise, there is really no reason to signal BIP91 and not BIP141. It's because with BIP141 you make a commitment that the whole network makes you keep and has been known for a year, while breaking the BIP91 promise at this point is like any of the other 100 empty promises made over the course of the last 6 months.
I don't want to create FUD, but it's really suspicious for any miner to signal BIP91 without BIP141. If they are ok with segwit at an 80% threshold, it makes no sense to not be ok with it at a 95% threshold.

SegWit is still only at &lt;50% signaling. I believe the signaling periods are 2016 blocks instead of 336 (or whatever bip91 is). 
After BIP91 locks in, it's a matter of seeing the signalers actually keep their promise and start orphaning blocks that don't signal Segwit.

You can clearly see how the real struggle in the whole debate is his ego. The way he speaks so downward towards the hostess and personal towards Jimmy and Samson. 
He used to be the central point of attention of Bitcoin. In the early days of the debate, he chose a side and he regrets. But his ego doesn't allow him to concede to the range of increasingly visible and important personalities at the other side of the debate.
Conceding in his mind would mean losing face, so he can only dig deeper in order to win the argument. At this point, he is so deeply invested in the argument that it's almost impossible to concede. He dug his own grave by standing too firm by a decision he made too early. 
Like others here suggested, the best thing he can do is take a break of 6 months, let things be for some time and hope that the anger that the community has built up against him will have been settled a bit. After all, we are a reasonable community that will value every contribution from a person that wants the best for the community as a whole.

They have been very silent about their position on the debate. Until very recently, when they started signaling BIP141 (slightly before BIP91 started).

There are really few people that exclude a block size increase from their long-term options. Even the two guys that wrote the Lightning Network paper concluded that bigger blocks are needed if all payments were over the LN and we wanted to onboard a significant part of the world's population. 
We're not there yet, though. On-chain scaling will have to happen, but it will need more time to be thought through. (Almost all proposals either require hard forks every time we want an increase or give big miners the ability to make it impossible for smaller miners to compete.)
The Lightning Network works, on testnet. There is some way to go before it's wallet-ready, meaning that we can start having people reliably pay each other, but it's been running on testnet (and litecoin mainnet) for some time. The protocols are still changing, though. It's important to take time to think those protocols through if you want the whole world to be able to use them for a long time. (Think IPv4, f.e.) 
It's normal that these things take time, so does agreeing on a good on-chain scaling solution. I personally don't think, however, that SegWit specifically should be part of that discussion. Blocking it is just a way for some fraction of the network to get more of a say than they deserve.
A 2 MB hardfork is a non-solution. It just postpones the problem and the search for a real solution while risking a disastrous fork.

What do you mean with this? It's really hard to distinguish between genuine transactions and fake ones.

If BIP148 activates with, say, 35% of the network hash rate. They won't be able to succeed. However, if then Bitmain's 40% starts mining an alt-coin, there's only 25% left on the original chain, making the BIP148 chain catch up with the original one.
I like this proposal. I'd be glad to see Bitmain leave our community to form their own. And I'm pretty sure all other miners would be too

It might be possible by doing analysis on the mempool when the new block arrives to see if the transactions were broadcast to the network before being included in a block. You'll never know for sure though, they might be transactions of special clients to the miner or txs you just didn't receive on time.


True, but I bet there is some threshold for the fee below which it is beneficiary for them to not include the transaction and use the space to raise the average, that will make them receive more fees in the future. It's also market theory of course.

That's not true. Lightning does prevent loss of money at all times, on the only condition that the adversary is not able to censor your transaction from being confirmed within the fraud proof window. That window can be adjusted to whatever the user feels comfortable with. I.e. a miner would need to mine all the next X blocks to make sure your tx doesnt get confirmed, where you chose X. I think three is perfectly safe at this point or the traditional 6 for the paranoid.


I disagree with this argument entirely, but I don't feel like diving in the numbers again. It also depends on what we both think is an acceptable end situation, of course.


Place that argument next to your argument that you don't like second layer solutions and compare it with the exact reverse opinion. While you can think and theorize about economic incentives, we never know for sure. The big difference between enabling second layer protocols and enabling miners to grow the block size is that the former can be easily opted in and out by users. Second layers solutions will never make on-chain payments obsolete and they will stay necessary and useful forever, especially for larger amounts than micropayments. However, once a dynamic block cap is enabled, users lose all their power of choice. If their software, hardware, network connection, ... cannot keep up with the increased throughput and resource requirements, they are out of the game and they will be force to use third-party service providers or stop using Bitcoin.
That's one of the major reasons why on-chain scaling should be handled very conservatively.


Why? Next to all the awesomeness of SegWit itself, it also gives us some breathing space to think more about on-chain scaling. (That's, right, a doubling in on-chain capacity only gives us some breathing space, no real solution.) It will give us time to figure out how hard we need it, given Lightning and how is the best way to go about it. But most importantly, time to get all parties on board instead of rushing a solution with a slight majority.

`SIGHASH_NOINPUT` is not an opcode, but a [sighash flag]( which defines what part of the transaction the sender needs to sign with his key.
But that will only cause confusion. The scenario you outlined is not how it works. When both parties make the two-of-two multisig address, they FIRST craft a refund transaction that they both sign and share. So, they first make sure that they can get their money back out, and only then sign the original transaction.
So, if you disappear after our initial setup, I already have a way to get refunded that you provided me beforehand. 
I can assure you, there is no way money can get lost in Lightning except in the situation I outlined above, where you are somehow unable to make the fraud proof transaction in time. A lot of work is done to make sure that risk is mitigated as much as possible, for example by creating incentives for others to help each other. If there is money to be made by just making a transaction that someone handed to you before, you can rest assured there will be people waiting to do that for you :) Probably mining pools will do it, since they can prioritize their transactions over those of others.

Not really. Bitcoin was the currency itself. And it had fundamentally different properties from other currencies. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:10:54
This is getting complex :D
First and foremost, I think you don't fully understand Lightning. Lightning transactions work as follows:
- you start with an initial balance by both spending the amount (say 50 / 50)
- at that point you both have a transaction that can refund you your 50 BTC when the other person disappears
- when transacting, you change the balances; let's say you send me 20, so it gets 70 / 30; you sign the tx so if you go away, I can use that tx to get my 70 btc
- at that point, you could broadcast the 50/50 tx, however, there is a clause in the tx that if I can prove there was a newer tx that you signed, I get all, so you are **incentivized to not TRY to scam me**
Now that is important. Even if you try, no matter what you do, it will fail because I can prove you are cheating. Like I said, the only way for you to actually steal is if you can prevent my cheat proof tx to get into a block within the time I have, which currently is in the order of days, i.e. impossible.
In Lightning, the worst thing someone can do to you, is not cooperate anymore. In that case, you have to broadcast your 70/30 tx and wait some days for the coins to arrive.
I don't know where you got the idea that an attacker can spend money in order for you to lose money. It's not true. The only difference that Lightning's security model has over Bitcoin's, is that you need to broadcast your cheat proof tx in time not to get robbed. But there exist schemes that allow you to rely on other to do it for you. Let's say I have the 70/30 and you cheat the 50/50, I can make a tx that proofs your 50/50 is a cheat and instead of paying all 100 to me, it pays 70 to me and 30 to whomever submits the tx. I can broadcast that tx and thus everyone has an incentive to keep that tx because they can make the 30 btc profit whenever you try to cheat.






I was not talking about choice of using 1st or 2nd layer txs. I mean choice over the effective block size. All the dynamic block size proposals put all the power with the miners. Users that don't have access to the required hardware to keep up, are rendered powerless.


Indeed, those proposals are far beneficiary over the ones where miners can change the blocksize by signaling or any other dynamic algorithm.






There's two UASF's going around. BIP 148 is the rush one, it wants to user-enforce the current BIP9 SegWit deployment. BIP 149 is a second SegWit deployment with a user-enforced deadline, meaning earliest in a year after November 15th 2017 (I assume).
I'm not sure what my position is on BIP 148. The solution is not rushed, SegWit has been working for a year and there is wide consensus about the demand for it. But it is risky to try to get enough people on board in only a few months, I agree. We will see what happens. I'd be happy with BIP 149, by that time, I guess the Lightning Network will be functional by that time, so that'd be awesome!

I've always suspected that once the miner efficiency saturated a bit, it would get better. And that might still be the case. It's normal that in the height of the race (cpu -&gt; gpu -&gt; fpga -&gt; asic -&gt; 16nm asics ..), it's hard for individuals to enter for a longer term than a few months before being irrelevant.
Miner efficiency is nearing an ultimatum now, IIRC we have 16nm asics and are trying to go to 14nm, but it probably can't get any better. There is a physical limit to processor performance. So I guess once the chips can't get any better, I guess mining manufacturers can focus more on targeting more different customers like individuals.
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:05:27
The peg is enforced by both blockchains. Moving coins from one to the other and vice versa happens through on-chain procedures that are by definition 1:1.
The caveat is thst these procedures take a long time (days) and a pretty significant fee (think a btc TX on the high byte size). So, off-chain markets can trade them instantly without the delay. This means that a very slight offset of the peg might exist on exchanges driven by momentary demand of coin on either chain.
A good example would be some popular token sale on either of the two chains. People tend to procrastinate, so the day before the sale, using the peg is no longer possible, so people will be buying coins on the token sale chain at a slight premium. 
TL;DR the 1:1 peg is enforced by the code, but a delay of some days for on-chain exchange can drive market prices to deviate slightly

First off, it's not intended as a scaling solution in the meaning of increasing txs per block. That's a side effect, I'm amazed that argument still comes up so much.
It is a scaling solution, though in the long term since it allows for pruning the blockchain of signatures, which is a significant benefit.
Apart from that, it must be clear by now that a blockchain an sich is inherently non-scalable. Ignoring the genius that is the Lightning Network is just silly. It's an innovation almost just as big as Bitcoin itself.
Not to speak of fixing transaction malleability which has been pestering Bitcoin developers for years or improved script versioning with things like Schnorr and MAST in the pipeline.

From BIP 141:










Old clients not adding the commitment will create invalid blocks.

I think he means that, for one person to balance the prices in two different exchanges, he needs to sell bitcoins on one exchange, move the money to the other and buy new bitcoins there on a lower price. Doing this, the prices will move closer to each other.
The mistake he makes is that there are thousands of traders, so there are (almost) no trades trading on multiple exchanges, meanwhile moving the money between the exchanges. What happens instead is one person selling on exchange 1 because it has the higher price and another person buying on exchange 2 because it has the lower price.
If a trader, usually trading on exchange 1, sees the price raise on exchange 2, he will buy. It doesn't matter how long it takes to move his money to exchange 2. Buyers will prefer the lowest price so as long as his exchange has a lower price than exchange 2, the price will raise and follow that of exchange 2.

I have only used BTC TC so far and i liked it.
Their website is quite slow, though, but they have 2 factor auth, which I like (no idea what BitFunder has).
They also allow you to fix a withdrawal address to prevent stolen coins.
You also get a nice overview of your own "value analysis" containing your earnings over time per asset.
Some thing to note, maybe is that I suspect that the website is a one-men's-project, which would, if true, could be a problem in the future. The reason why I suppose this is that in e-mail correspondence with them, the other person always answered with "I should possibly have programmed that differently." and "I will consider this." Just saying, could be incorrect.
@_date: 2013-05-24 09:04:38
On your SEPA remark. I read on Wikipedia "The project's aim is to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments and turn the fragmented national markets for euro payments into a single domestic one."
I think it *is* SEPA's goal to united all Europe's state with the Euro as a currency, but this is just not yet the case since not all countries adopted or were allowed to adopt the Euro.
But you were right that many countries not yet using the Euro are inside the SEPA area.
About the withdrawal limit. Bitcoin exchanges should register as payment processors or whatever statute that gives them the right to process unlimited amounts of money. Sadly, those deciding who can have such a statute do not very much like Bitcoin. Hopefully this will change in the future. Nevertheless, they could communicate their *extreme* delays before you do a withdrawal. I waited longer than a month...

Both in Belgium and in Portugal, it's tax-free. In Belgium you have to be able to proof that it was a gain on an investment, though. So you need your proof of purchase.
So mining is taxed like any personal/corporate income. Selling items also normal tax I'd support.

@_date: 2013-11-07 20:16:37
I'm thinking as well that this is the big hole in their theory. All clients tent to connect to a set of supernodes hosted by trusted parties. These nodes are either miners (clients will connect to them to send an receive blocks faster) or relay nodes that keep as much nodes as possible in their memory to relay traffic as fast as possible.
Performing a Sybil attack is particularly difficult since you will have to trick other parties.
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:33:50
A solution that lets miners decide on a block size is not a good solution. Miners can artificially fill blocks and fake need for bigger ones and fill those up too. Having bigger blocks will make it harder for smaller miners to compete, increasing the power of the big miners to raise the block size even more.. 
It's really important to see that Bitcoins spam prevention mechanism is kinda broken. Miners don't pay mining fees, so they can add whatever transactions they want to a block, effectively influencing statistics like avg fee, number of txs and block sizes. 
A system in which the block fee would, f.e. be delayed to the next block, would prevent this.

I think he wants you to roll a full-length private key...
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:22:05
It is possible that you have an address collision, which means that another person created the same address as yours. This is very unlikely, but possible.
This would also imply that he has access to the coins you send to that address.
In the case of an address collision, you can better transfer all coins on the address to another one if you want to keep them :)

Your fifth and sixth part are different, that's weird.

Fifth was "All the other pizzas got jealous on this date."
I answered "May 21" since the first pizza was sold for Bitcoins that date.
Sixth was "Speaking of dates, what is celebrated by some people the same day 2 months later?"
I answered "National Day" because July 21 is Belgium's National Day. I tried some other answers as well but none worked.

I looked into Bitstamp before, but I didn't understand why they promote themselves as a Europe-targeting exchange but convert all incoming Euro tranfers to dollars first.
I understand that the BTC/USD market is more stable and mature, but it won't help the BTC/EUR market if Euro customers will use dollars as well...
Maybe I will transfer my coins to Bitstamp, they still say SEPA withdrawals only take 2-3 business days, which is awesome if true.
The fact that they are UK-based also gives me more trust than a Japan-based company that has its EU hq in Poland ( thanks to [Bitco]( :p

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network. This means that something is only valid if all nodes accept it.
All conditions of validity of blocks/transactions/... are specified in the protocol and implemented in Bitcoin clients.
This means that a miner can try whatever they want, other's will not accept it's actions and they will have no meaning. All clients check blocks and transactions for validity and will refuse incorrect ones. 
So, a block with a reward that is too high will be ignored.
Also all clients calculate the difficulty using the time it take to create the last 2016 blocks (~2 weeks), so they will all have the same value calculated individually, ignoring blocks that do not have a hash fitting the difficulty.
BTW, consider using the [Bitcoin StackExchange]( next time you have a question.

The thing is that transactions done using localbitcoins are very limited. You mention that you intended to buy a house partly with the bitcoins. I can't imagine that the seller of the house would accept the pile of cash you retrieved from selling bitcoins on localbitcoins, can you?
Exchanging euros and bitcoin should be subject to the same legislation as exchanging dollars or other foreign currencies. If your country requires you to pay taxes on those exchanges, they have a point that you should too. But I don't think that is the case...

Armory is good, but currently uses a ton of RAM. I've been in contact with the lead developer of Armory and he is working hard on a whole new version of Armory that solves this problem.
Until then, I wouldn't recommend it, it has to build an index every startup, storing it in RAM memory.
But once this issue is solved, Armory will probably be the better choice again. Watch their GitHub repo :)

I haven't seen any similar proposal on r/bitcoin. I have to admit I only look at the hot page and not the new posts.
What I do see are all those posts advocating mBTC. So the reason of my post is to draw the attention away from mBTC, which in my opinion is not the way to go, and make people aware of the fact that this indeed a discussion that has not been ended.
