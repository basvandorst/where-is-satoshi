I would bet the upcoming [Purism Librem 5]( won’t steal your data.

How’s the network going to be kept secure after all coins are issued?

Probably best to avoid trading for a non-fungible cryptocurrency.

Me too. I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of Purism’s [Librem 5]( phone in fall of this year, which is supposed to come with a crypto-currency wallet out-of-the-box, and does not require sending keys to clouds or whatever.

Securing a network is indeed unrelated to the actual number of coins. But when no more coins can be mined eventually, there'll be no more incentive for miners to keep securing the network. Seems like the abyss is waiting.

Think so too, Coinbase also provides a Bitcoin Vault, which is like your Coinbase Wallet, but because it’s kept physically off-line, should be immune (relatively speaking) against Coinbase getting hacked. The only inconvenience is it takes 48 hours to “warm them up again”. But security doesn’t come free.
However, for really large amounts, I would still take them off-line if you can manage the process yourself.

As far as I understand, deflation is negative inflation, not falling (above-zero) inflation. In theory, I think you could describe Bitcoin as "inflation-less" eventually, when every single coin is mined. However, in reality, due to coins getting lost, it will probably be net deflationary.
Falling inflation is sometimes called "disinflation". An example coin with such emission scheme is Monero. It has a similar curve as Bitcoin, except that it has a fixed tail emission at a certain point, to ensure continued blockchain security, without having to rely on a fee market. While it already has pretty good privacy today, it is unsure how well it will scale as usage increases.
