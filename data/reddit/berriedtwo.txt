Is the easiest/fastest way to move from crypto -&gt; fiat through coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:29:40
Awesome, thank you! 
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:40:48
Honestly I just don’t fuck with any of that. It might be legit but you can always just buy one with your local currency and let the bitcoin rise. Any btc you spend is btc you won’t be making money on in the future. 
That’s just my personal philosophy though.

Don’t send anyone anything because they claim they’ll send back more. Don’t give out your private key. Double check your urls. 
You’ll be okay.

If it seems too good to be true...

None? I wouldn’t have bought crypto if I wanted that. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:31:58
THANK YOU. Spent actual minutes staring trying to figure out what that was.
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:33:49
what is happening here. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:56:04
Good. More time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:47:11
You do not talk about... bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-08-02 06:19:41
Wait it’s a real person?
@_date: 2019-08-02 06:04:15
What? You don’t know who tekashi is?

Except once you receive a gaming account... you simply change the password and personal information.
Once you receive a crypto private key- if the original owner made a copy, they can empty it without your consent at any time. 
Definitely silly.

Is there going to be an overlap where we can send our coins from binance.com to binance us?

Sell high to usd. Then buy low. You’ll have more than you started with. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:42:03
Optimally you would sell as soon as you see it dropping from 10k... then re-buy low. But if you’re asking if you should sell it now that it’s at 7.5k (theoretically) and rebuy immediately then, no. That wouldn’t make a difference. I may be misunderstanding your wording though.

You, sir, are a bitcoin oracle. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:10:36
Fantastic subject line. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:47:25
Care to explain? How would you go about doing that?
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:05:05
All of them? Bitcoin would death spiral. Transactions would stay pending indefinitely.
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:38:32
Hahaha I don’t know if this was made with serious intention but I found it hilarious for some reason. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:29:49
It’s not making more of the original bitcoin... it’s creating a new coin entirely at a certain block height.
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:51:24
Ah. Gotcha. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 07:31:03
Why wasn’t there a fee for that tx? 
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:09:22
Buy an extra one now? 
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:54:09
Dude has been trying to sell these for such a long time... nobody’s going to pay anything for those- much less .25 btc lol
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:13:24
Hahaha I love this. I get way too attached to my cryptos. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:02:53
A lot. But that would require you being able to see into the future. Same scenario applied to stocks would also be massively lucrative but it’s just not that easy. Plus then you have to ask... did you short sell every time bitcoin dipped 10$? Or what was the threshold for a “low” or “high” to qualify for a trade?
@_date: 2019-05-31 06:56:33
Exact same sentiment. Was going to downvote until I saw this comment...Then I upvoted everything.
