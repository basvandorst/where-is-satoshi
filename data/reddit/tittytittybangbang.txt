I clearly agree, it's not like there are different charts, saying different things, using different metrics, all claiming that bitcoin might go up or down at any given moment, that are posted here daily.  These people clearly have an edge over us Phoenicians.  I'm just confused why people don't use the right chart that predicts bitcoin's movement accurately.  It's almost like people really can't accurately predict where bitcoin will go, but still post links to charts of where they want it to go.

Yes, the futures exchange that is now available is cash only, you don't have to own bitcoin.  Bitmex is a different story though, but there is a way to short bitcoin now, using cash only.  Like my advice to the other guy, if you are going to short bitcoin, go huge otherwise there isn't a lot of profit in it, don't be a pussy.

Hey, I really appreciate the apology!  It was a generic answer, but my point was simply, you could have 2, billion dollar hedge fund managers, one has made crap returns for their investors, they buy a bunch of bitcoin (pump), short it and dump.  Boom, all of a sudden your investors are happy and you live to invest another day.  By that same token, you have the other billion dollar hedge fund manager that has been producing good returns for his investors, he sees bitcoin as a cash cow that can be ridden for a long time and he goes long.  Nobody has any way of predicting the motivation behind these moves except, the person making those moves is motivated by profit.  That's all.  These predictoins of cme futures, price, dips, ath's are all just speculation, and that's why I gave the generic answer.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:38:29
No shit sherlock, but you have to have people dumping a shitload of bitcoin to get the price to drop, you know, that whole supply and demand thing that effects the price of a bitcoin, not the piece of paper saying you are shorting it.

I woke up this morning finding my side view mirror had been clipped by some assbag last night.  I'm thinking to myself, "this is going to a crap Monday."  Decide to check bitcoin, see it nicely and quickly recovered from its little dip, and then I see Ver is being utterly destroyed by both r/bitoin and r/btc, and then this.  It's going to be a fucking great day after all!!!!

sometimes a buyer will throw a huge amount of money at a price point he wants, say btc is trading at 16,800, and I'm like screw that, I want 17,000 for my coin, I throw up that number and it imposes a barrier for moment, either people buy that wall up or they continue to trade at amounts right below it.  A sell wall is only really effective if you have a good amount of fiat or coin to bluff with

Most people don't know what the fuck they are doing, they try and read in their stock knowledge and wonder why bitcoin doesn't act like a stock, then they post on here 2 months later about their losses which no one really gives a shit about.

There are plenty of people making large investments now, at these prices.  They see the gamble, are comfortable with it, and at least have some idea of technology behind it.  Those are the people any investment pool wants, not the flakes that flip the fuck out when their 20$ investment goes to 10$.  They can go play with penny stocks, but most of them wouldn't even be smart enough to know how to get an account to trade them.  So good riddance, and there is no trophy for participation in bitcoin.

This comment is going to get buried, but keep your filthy hands off bitcoin.  Everything the government touches turns to filth and an instrument for the rich and powerful to bend and twist to their benefit.  This was not created for you, this was created for the people.  If you were really worried about rooting out corruption and illegal activity, you should be knocking on every bank and trading house's door from here to China and Congress, the lobbyist, and the the White House itself, but I don't see anybody doing a damn thing about that.

@_date: 2014-10-13 10:13:26
I find it hard to believe that someone that allows it to be accepted by it's merchants and came out publicly and said he would invest himself, hates bitcoin.  It's a new revolution, just because somebody doesn't accept it immediately and has reservations about it, shouldn't mean that they are an enemy of bitcoin.  The only way this whole thing will be accepted by large merchants, is through patience and perseverance, not calling bullshit on everybody that is a little skeptical.  Broaden your mind and look at the bigger picture.

Yes, if you sleep tonight, you will probably miss some kind of price fluctuation in bitcoin.  I personally am getting my eyelids removed so I can permanently avoid sleep and witness this fluctuation that has been inherent in bitcoin since its inception

I use Circle or Coinbase, but I never hold any amount of coins there for very long, When I first started, I used to buy them with a paypal account off Virwox, a lot of fees, but was convenient at the time

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:32:33
You obviously haven't been in bitcoin very long, you should refrain from posting your uneducated opinion ( on situations like what just occured) until you have done your research.  This is just business as usual.  Once you have done your research, I'm sure you'll want to then start posting price predictions, please don't do that as well.  People that do that look like idiots.  Do your research, bitcoin goes up and down, attacks will happen, in the end bitcoin will still be there when the dust settles.

If you are asking this question you are not going to make any money selling the rips and buying the dips.  Just hold on to your investment and quit watching the price ticker.  It's hard, I know, but you will lose money trying to time this market especially with everything that is going on now.

You probably need to make some power moves.  Delete facebook, get a lawyer, and start working out.  You also need to invest in some serious hardware with that type of investment!
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:57:27
Depending on how long you have had bitcoin, you possibly have access to an equal amount of bch, btg, and maybe btsilver or whatever it will be in the future if it happens.  It is a bit of a trick to get your equal balance for bch and btg but can be done.  My advice is just hold your coin right now, if you just have a tiny balance look at maybe transfering off coinbase to a mobile wallet like coinomi, mycellium, or jaxx.  Make sure you transfer when fees are low, don't worry about the confirmation time.  Coinbase does not currently support bch, or btg, so in all reality wait till they do if you want to keep your coins there, but I would recommend one of the mobile wallets I mentioned above.  I have a hardware wallet because I have a large investment of btc, but that really only makes sense if someone has 1,000 or more invested in my opinion.  I found coinomi had the best instructions on how to get my bch from my btc.  I haven't even bothered with splitting bitgold yet, not many exchanges will even do it.

I would consider it worth it for anything over 1,000, just my personal opinion.  I used to have several coins on mycelium and never had a problem, but I sleep better now, knowing I have them on a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:02:29
No prob, just know to always keep your seeds with mobile wallets, protect them with your life, exchanges are easier to hack if you have your coin in a hot wallet, but anything can be hacked eventually.  Hardware wallets, or paper wallets created offline seem to be the most secure at the moment.  Good luck my friend.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:37:59
Yes, sarcasm.  Just learn to use the correct terminology.  What just happened was bitcoin being bitcoin, or a quick correction fueled by exuberance and exchanges going down due to massive trading.  When you start throwing around words like bubble and crashes it makes you look dumb.  No hate here, so don't take this negatively.  Welcome to bitcoin, I suggest you invest in a pair of depends diapers and get a prescription for xanax.

@_date: 2017-11-30 05:56:01
I know you never said crash, but throwing around bubble as a word for correction, which is what bitcoin does, sounds just as dumb as crash.  A bubble is something that bursts, I didn't see that in the last 48 hours.  I saw a correction which was completely explainable.

The responsible thing would be to not invest more than you can afford to lose, actually use bitcoin to purchase things, test out different trusted wallets, exchanges, and spending methods and report back on your successes or lack of.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.  But that's really no fun at all.
What you should really do is invest money you can't afford to lose, stock up on cocaine or redbull, watch the ticker constantly, complaine bitcoin ruined your life everytime it takes a dip, start planning on being a millionare every time there is a 20 point jump, post all of this on reddit all the time, and most importantly make foundless predictions on where the price is going based on your useless stock charts and magic 8-ball

Ah!, this is a classic "king and Pauper" pattern.  This is prone to repeat itself many times unless, the "right left, right left, sliding glass door" candles appear.  That could mean the complete opposite of the "king and pauper" pattern and be the sign of the, "frog and scorpion" run, which is good if you are a bear wanting to be a bull, but not good if you are a bull wanting to be a man.

How bout you get the fuck out with your stupid predictions, and William's table, I have a better chance of wiping my butt with your face and reading the turds than you do predicting the price
@_date: 2015-11-10 01:50:44
Who's we and what the fuck are you looking at, im speculating you have no fucking clue what you are talking about

You are right, I just don'the like the whole price speculation, it's bullshit and doesn't do anything positive for the sub or the whole concept!  And I'll call a spade a spade when I see one.
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:52:56
I call bullshit

Awesome, do you want me to pull up the 4,000 posts about it's hitting the moon, im sure we can get some collaboration for the price on no evidence but just hunches somewhere in one of those posts.

Poor guy would have done this whole reveal years ago, but he was ordering his external drive from Circuit City, not realizing they closed

At least he is Asian, and probably has mad ninja skills

Yes, the logic here is sound,  b+nonsense=1, carry on

What really matters is the fungibility of the currency, the price will take care of itself.  I believe the down fall of constantly watching the price, is it is a short sighted way of looking at the currency for those who don't appreciate or understand the currencies full potential.

Glad to meet you spartacus,  i'm working on a new project I could use your help with, mums the word, but the real money is in lego blocks, and chains.  I need you as head of security.

just because you are into bitcoin doesn't mean you could be an idiot
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:21:17
I personally don't think someone that has tried and successfully remained out of the limelight for so long with such a revelutionary idea, would all of a sudden just pop up like this ass bag did.  C.W. is a delusional fuck trying to take credit for something or someone he couldn't even be worthy enough to lick the dog shit off their boots.
@_date: 2016-07-07 20:43:10
The halvening is where all bitcoin users transfer our bitcoin to paper wallets, then at midnight on Saturday (Satoshi time), we tear our wallets in half in defiance of the god c.w. the false idol.  We will then puchase new nike shoes, chop off our penises, and wait for the great Nakamoto commett to deliver unto Soshi land

Nice chart
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:29:53
1. Buy new pair of nike shoes
2. Make up "special" batch of koolaid
3. Transfer all btc to a paper wallet
4. 4 minutes before halvening happens, cut off penis, tear paper wallet in half, slam shots of "special koolaid" and then sit back and wait for the Satoshi commet to wisk you off to the moon!!!
