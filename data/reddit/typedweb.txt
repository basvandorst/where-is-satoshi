I describe it as digital money and a good investment in the future.  I see the time now like in the early 90s for the internet and we're just getting started on seeing where BTC will go with micropayment sites like ChangeTip. Most people I talk to about it are interested and would like to know more, but they really don't understand it yet.  It's the reponsibility of everyone to point out uses, although I'm actually buying and holding for a future where BTC exchange is more obituous.


Through an exchange and I got interested in it many years ago because I believe it's the future of internet financial transactions.


My favorite wallet is blockchain.info's so far.  Fast, pretty secure, easy to use, instant conversion and it comes with an Android client as well.


PayByPhone and technologies like ChangeTip.  It's never been so easy to send money now in a post, we just need to get more BTC in the hands of regular people so they can actually tip without jumping through a bunch of hoops to get some BTC (which it sounds like you're trying to do).


Some of those savings should be passed along to the consumer, yes.


The more places that accept it, the more comfortable they will become.

Bitcoin is an online digital currency that is run in a decentralized way.

Then once you have them you can spend them where they are accepted, tip with them using ChangeTip or hold them and hope they go up in value so you can retire early.

Sorry, change.org :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:59:19
Good luck :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:40:35
I made 110000 Satoshis today, so not too bad.  I think the problem is that people might not have the BTC to tip with yet, so getting them into the hands of the masses is of the utmost importance!
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:51:55
Hopefully they put in a maximum run time for a contract to get around that whole halting problem thing.  That was the purpose of the original non-turing complete language implemented in the original BTC protocol; it guaranteed termination of the contracts.
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:07:25


No, not according to this post:
TL;DR: You should always sent the *entire balance* of your paper wallet to a new address or else you might end up losing the rest of the balance to a new, unknown change address.

I saw there was a proposal at Change.gov for amazon, but I don't think they accept yet.  That would be HUGE news.
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:54:01
Sounds like ripple.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:18:01
Almost none of Satoshis BTC was ever 'spent' and some were just sent to other people for testing purposes.  Most of what he mined is still just sitting there, probably gone forever.
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:34:56
There definetely is a need to get BTC in the hands of people cheaply.  
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:02:18
So, Future Time Traveller, you're saying bitcoin really took off?
@_date: 2014-11-11 03:13:40
ShapeShift doesn't seem to do a check or I would have known.  I only noticed after I tried what I thought was the LTC address in an LTC faucet...

Why wait?  (plus the others I can't remember that offer binary options).  'Provably fair' and all that as well.

I've seen BTC and LTC debit cards, but nothing credit related to do with bitcoin other than crowd loans at BTCJam.com and some ad I saw once a while back that promised credit if you open a wallet account with them...can't remember the name anymore though.
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:05:57
Thanks! Wasn't really asking for them but I'll take them anyways :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:00:13
Not sure what you mean.  
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:04:27
I'm positive that it was ShapeShift, yes. I checked my history.
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:45:04
You've heard of shares in a company haven't you?  Well buying into a mining operation is like buying shares of their resources.  Yes, it's a way to raise money but the payouts can be thought of as dividends for your investment.  I'm not that invested in my mining op but that's how I think of it.  It's kind of like why a mining hardware company would sell the units if they were profitable...some companies do one thing, some do the other. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:49:40
Don't bother getting them to install a wallet, just use blockchain.info/wallet.  It's good enough for beginners to get their toes wet and it has automatic balance conversion to fiat so they know just how much they're making with the tips.  Oh, and if you're looking for someone to take your money, i'm all for it :)

Holy crap.  Nice one to get someone started!
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:15:57
Depends on if we get another price rise like the one I mentioned in the parent :)  Right now they don't seem very worth it where most of them give out only 100-500 satoshis, but back then 0.05 of a bitcoin was just being given away as worthless, so you never know what might happen in the future.  Using the landofbitcoin.com interface you can get about 10000 satoshis every few hours, which is not much today.

I think that one tip was the start of the viral nature of this whole changetip thing...

It was my first time using a litecoin address but I accidently clicked on the BTC address tab at my exchange account.  It doesn't seem like ShapeShift does a check of the address before you submit so beware.
@_date: 2014-11-11 01:35:01
Good idea.  I think every Satoshi is going to be worth something in the future once this technology hits the mainstream, plus it's a great way to learn and think about investing.
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:23:21
Try QuickBT.com.  It uses interac email money transfer and you just need to provide your phone number for verification.  Only sells upto .25 BTC though and might only work in Canada.

You can look up the transaction id or the address you sent to (to find the transaction id) on  to verify that the funds got to where you sent them.
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:31:20
I sent support a message with all of the information I had about the transaction, like send and recieve addresses and the amount I sent to them to be converted.  Hopefully that will be enough to get them to issue me a refund.

I sent to a hosted address at my exchange.  I sent from a BTC address to ShapeShift not an LTC address, but gave a BTC address as the output LTC address.  I don't know how the blockchain would show the transaction as most people have said, it never would have gone through to the bad address but the ShapeShift web client doesn't check for address validity before confirming the transaction.

I was searching around for a way to hedge future bitcoin purchases and found this site so I thought I would share for those that are more interested in the technical aspect of trading bitcoins.

ShapeShift is a conversion tool between cryptocoins.  I sent BTC to a BTC address and they take and LTC address as the return address for the converted coin, except instead of providing an LTC address I gave a BTC address by mistake.  I didn't send any LTC, I was trying to get some for my BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:48:58
Awesome, thanks!

I think you have to reply to the original post and not the changetip post if you want it to work.
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:50:33
It sounds like you're calling for or saying that a number of forks would be *good* for the bitcoin ecosystem to keep from a single set of developers from controlling the whole direction of where it's going.  I'm curious how that would work out...a number of different bitcoin core clients and daemons running on the same blockchain.  Would that work and would the majority win?  Would it little the blockchain with garbage and create a war of rejected transactions from incompatible clients?
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:08:02


Thanks:   I've heard about him from 'The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin' and that's why I'm asking about what kind of regulations you would have to follow.  I'm not looking at going as big and as fast as him, obviously, and I want to be sure I'm doing everything by the book.  I'm, obviously, not going to base all my research off of reddit but I thought I would start here to see what people have to say.
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:38:10
I think it's pretty motivating to post quality content on social sites if you can get paid by other users or the site for doing them.  
CryptoBucket ( is a new social media site for cryptocurrency users that tips you when you do an action (currently 40 satoshis, but it's better than nothing) and I personally find it very motiviating to keep active on the site.  The issue with that is gaming the site to kill the pool of bitcoins, but for now it seems to be working enough that they keep it going.  
ChangeTip on the other hand is just totally awesome in that the other readers and users can payup your posts so easily.  KillerApp indeed and I signed up for my  ChangeTip account today, so tip away :)

I'm using hashie.co and after getting some payouts I calculated that it would take about 5 months to get an ROI. It's got a nice, easy to use website and support is fast if you contact them.  I would recomend them (plus I actually use them).  Plus I think they still have a free 10GH miner for signing up deal just to try out the service which gets you about ~7000 satoshis a day, but you have to buy a min of 20GH in to do a transfer out, which is about $10USD.
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:47:44
I'm in Canada so things might be a bit different.
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:08:40
No, they won't be worth more than any of the others, but I think they're going to be the biggest treasure hunt in history as people try to break Satoshi's private keys in coming years...

Pretty standard social network features like a posting wall, person to person chat, friending, etc.  The bonus is that you get a small amount of satoshis for every action you do, so it's a bit of a combination faucet/social network site.  They've got a contest running right now to give away $100 worth of cryptocoins if you create a profile. I like it...it's cooler than facebook :)

"GIve me control of a nations money supply and I care not who writes the laws."
With bitcoin, who has control of the money supply?  Nobody and everybody at the same time.  And this time it's not just a nation, it could potentially be the world.  
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:56:11
The more this community grows as a monetary system, the more it sounds like a how governments *should* work.  The code is the policy or law, the passing of that law (upgrading your software client) is done by those that are participating in the system.  Very interesting indeed.

If people don't know what BTC is then it's difficult for them to understand what a price or a gift of .273 BTC even means. For now we'll have to do the dollar route so that they can know that these bits have value, and for now about the only value that's attached to BTC is in dollars (or pesos, or rubles or whatever) because so few merchants actually take them for good and services.  Eventually if volatility goes down I'm sure prices will be listed in BTC with a conversion on the side.
