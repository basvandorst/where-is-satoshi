Thanks, that's helpful. But what happens in a scenario like this (just an example)?  
- Bought one btc in Jan 2016.  
- Sell .10 btc today (2017).  
- buy .15 btc next month in the dip.  
- sell .25 btc three months later at all time high.
My guess:   
- The .10 btc sale today is taxed at 15%  
-But what about the .25 btc sale several months from now?   
- Is the first .15 btc (of the .25 btc total sold) taxed at regular income rate (b/c bought in the last year), while the remaining .10 btc is taxed at 15% because it's part of the original 1 btc holding purchased in Jan 2016?

Newbie question: how can the wall St whales theoretically sell off huge amounts of bitcoin at once? I'm just a coinbase pleb and they have weekly sell limits to stop users from selling big amounts.

Can you please elaborate on the tax angle? If I end up w more btc by selling and then buying the dip (while giving Uncle Sam his due), why not do it?

I saw a clip of some guy who chiseled the private key onto steel, aluminum, and copper and subjected them to extreme temperatures to demonstrate their durability.  
  
If I wanted to protect my bitcoin down through the generations, is this the sort of solution to consider?

I've been searching for a definition of FUD. Can you help me out?

Can you elaborate on this? Which way triggers a taxable event: (1) transferring coinbase funds to your private wallet and then to gemini or (2) transferring funds from coinbase directly to gemini?
