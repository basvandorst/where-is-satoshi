And long term it seems reasonable to assume the value will exceed $20+ and be stable, but for the people who just heard about bitcoin because they heard about some people almost doubling their money inside of a month, will probably be a very nervous speculator when the price dips a little.

Are you fucking insane or talking out your ass for fun? The Google guys Sergey Brin and Larry Page were doing PHDs in Computer Science at Stanford when they started Google. They were fucking experts at silly markup languages. How do you think they could develop bots to parse HTML if they didn't know HTML.
Do you really think markup language is beyond the capability of 2 people building computers out of lego and developing the largest distributed DB in the world? The logo is one they created in GIMP and it was simple and did the job, right now that design is one of the most recognisable logos on the planet and nobody gave a shit about making it shiny.
The Google design wasn't snazzy because that is what everyone was doing at the time, worrying about the sparkles and glitter rather than the core function, and you know what, that strategy of function over form is what got Google such a giant lead that even as a company with no revenue at the time could not only survive the dot-com bubble, but wire themselves into the infrastructure of the internet when investors returned.

Well applied mathematics and the engineering fields around it allow us to touch other planets and continents in an instant. Not suprisingly, the growth, change and potential have attracted some of this generations best minds because lets face it, nobody gets laid or is considered even mildly interesting working in finance.
If more money is traded in London or Tokyo than Wall St but silicone valley is actually a leader in an industry with plenty of vcs compared to anywhere else in the world, why would the best and brightest end up on wall street scraping small margins for high stress?

Your best and brightest are probably in silicone valley, not wall street.

And because critical mass hasn't be achieved yet we shouldn't be seeing 100% or more growth in a month and assume its stable.
Imagine this growth trend continues for a few months and we get to the crazy level price for current day bitcoin (say &gt; $50), that will just cause another round of mass publicity for bitcoin, more nervous speculation on the currency and then a dip to reality again and we will have to wait another couple of years for the stink to wear off. That is the definition of a bubble and that slows the adoption of bitcoin.
To achieve critical mass you need stability.

I found some of the comments interesting and some of the criticism is valid.
For instance the comment about volatile currencies attracting more speculators and stable currencies attracting people actually using the currency is a fair one. If you are going long on BitCoin then maybe a 100% increase in value in a month and a spread of $4 in 24 hours is actually just slowing the process down. Stable and sustainable growth would be favourable if you want to live in a world where you can take a mortgage out in BTC without gaining or losing 10% while you sleep.

Does that mean I shouldn't take your advice too?

There are plenty of countries in the anglosphere that use Metric. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK (well maybe not old people).
In fact, come to think of it, just about 50 British CommonWealth nations use metric, which makes up the majority of the native English speaking world and the majority of places where Anglos settled. Just because your country mostly imports American contrnt onto your telly, does not make that representitive of Anglo-saxons around the world.

See that second spike near the end of the graph? Well that is in the last month and accounts for an almost $10 increase on something that cost $13 - $14 before that point.
The growth from August to December, it was common for the price to bounce between $13 and $10 but in the last month it has gone up by what will soon be **100%**. That is not slow or consistent.
Sure, last month might be the base of some huge bell curve that will go almost straight up before it plateaus some time in the future but I can't think of any reason why that would be true. It seems more likely that the currency will continue to do what it has always done which is bounce up and down (with peaks and valleys) with a long term trend towards growth, and if that is the case, then the price will come down as soon as whatever non-sustainable trend that increased the demand slumps or stops completely.
If the sudden new demand in the last month is artificial or non-sustainable demand, then the more the value climbs now, the more bubble-ish it will be when it eventually drops again.

Look at the hash rate, most of that is by actual Asics in peoples hands.

I don't think thats true at all (but I can understand why such a comment would be upvoted here).
The upturn happened over a period of 12 hours in the last month, so that is not slow or consistent, instead its dynamic which increases the potential risks (and rewards) of investment.
If the increased demand of BitCoins at &gt; $20 is artificial and BTC's recent value fluctuation dips back to the teens, people who bought in at $20+ will probably get cold feet and dump BTC which would cause the value to drop (although gambling and silkroad alone will probably keep the price above $10 consistently).
Although long term view on bitcoin seems likely to have growth as demand increases, you can't know this is not a bubble till you find out what caused this sudden demand for bitcoin and if that demand is sustainable.
