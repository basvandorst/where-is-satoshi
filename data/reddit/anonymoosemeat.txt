You can send money to your friends using a debit card?

I'd imagine if the computer was used somewhere after the fact then the odds are nearly zero, if it's sitting in a dump since OP last used it and nobody used it (and potentially wrote over the sections of the drive multiple times) then it's entirely possible. Since they're HDDs at the time most likely, if the file was even deleted cyber forensics people or whatever they call themselves could potentially recover the wallet information.

And then after segwit locked in before it was activated they announced an official hard fork date before we got to see how segwit affects the network and if 2x is even necessary. But of course the valid point you had no argument for so you glossed over it

2x not having replay protection and expecting people to follow the agreement and potentially fuck over thousands of users is fat more contentious than companies not allowing their customers to get screwed over

Im far more tired of posts about how much btc or use someone has. Who gives a shit, it's clutter. I'd prefer if the sub was more bitcoin news and discussion than 'hey guess how much money I have'
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:42:05
I do think it's badly needed, nobody really accepts bitcoin and it's current major use case isn't microtransactions. So why are rushing to put a shitty temporary bandaid on a problem that affects a use case that's barely there
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:02:34
But the goal of bitcoin is a long term solution to a problem, not a bunch of short term band aids for a period of time that, in the grand scheme of things, is completely irrelevant.

How can you look at this subreddit and still nothing this fork is contentious? Are you serious?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:58:45
They're creating a problem and asking someone else to solve it. That's why it's on the forking party. Core wouldn't need replay protection if there wasn't a fork. You're asking for a new kind of attack wherein people could fork all over the place and since there's precedent for Core having to implement replay protection they'll have to waste time and bloat the code with replay protection for shit they never wanted in the first place
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:34:39
Eeh, different chain
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:22:54
We haven't even gotten a chance to test how the segwit implementation helps bitcoin, so nobody can make a fair assessment of whether this fork is necessary. If anything the fact that it was announced before segwit was activated shows they're trying to sneak it in. There's no reason for it to happen so early
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:59:44
I prefer 2x not just say we're not doing anything but you're the asshole if you *also* don't do anything.

Corrections are completely fine, it's unhealthy for assets to only go up without any kind of dip or correction

Gemini, unless they've done something wrong too.
EDIT: Shit just read below that Gemini was a part as well. I'm out

But why? What is it solving right now? The mempool is relatively empty

Any forward-thinking company wouldn't screw themselves over in the future for minor problems now, actually. Your imaginary company would be out of business in 10-20 years because of the technical debt of shitty short-term solutions

They don't really have a choice. They're forced by law to be AML/KYC compliant so, it's not really their fault

In that case do what you want. If you are going to pick an exchange to leave them on, one insured by the FDIC is the place to do it. 
Personally I'm here for both monetary and ideological reasons so I choose not to trust my coins to be held by an exchange. 
I will say one more thing, it's far easier to hack username/account credentials than the bitcoin protocol. So if you are going to leave coins on an exchange, for the love of god use 2FA, and for added security don't use the same username/password that you use for everything else.

The top vertcoin wallets also own a disproportionately large percentage of VTC compared to the top bitcoin wallets
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:42:08
It definitely would. Since we're speculating, I'd wager we never see those coins move, ever.
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:57:12
Mildly off topic, weird place. Almost no threads about their own coin

Yes, this particular account is 3 weeks old. Good job!

What is reddit's obsession with account ages? It's almost like you can make as many reddit accounts as you want. And how long you've been using the same account on a web site has no relation to someone's knowledge.

Banking on Bitcoin was interesting. Though if you've been following bitcoin for a while you may find nothing new. More of another way to keep hearing about bitcoin

Even Satoshi said in his emails people work best with numbers between 0.1 and 1000. I think it's time for mBTC
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:30:03
The point of Bitcoin was trustless exchange of value. Letting someone else hold your coins is like saying "I don't care about the message of bitcoin, I just want to make money off of it"
And aside from ideological reasons, if you don't control your keys you don't control the fate of your coins. I think one of the Coinbase storage options is FDIC insured up to a certain amount but I'd still never trust it. Just look at mt gox or btc-e.

It has the same method of distribution. But the actual distributions are quite different. The beauty of bitcoin was it's ability to spread while it was essentially valueless. Vertcoin also doesn't solve any problems at the moment. 
It's like Litecoin lite. I like Litecoin, but even it struggles to prove it's necessity. Litecoin fees aren't a problem, so currently the real value of vertcoin is, what, a test bed for atomic swaps with litecoin before bitcoin gets atomic swaps? 
It's currently one of 4 coins split from the same original code, with one single benefit of being ASIC resistant. Assuming none of the other 3 fork to become ASIC resistant in the near future. 
I have the same problems with VTC as I have with 2x, it solves a problem we aren't currently facing. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:06:30
Coinbase is still supporting 2x I believe

Getting tired of these 'I bought bitcoin' threads. Not to shit on OP's parade, but we really don't need them every day

They all doubled down against core with Bcash, so they have to believe that core is going to be killed or admit that they were wrong.

I'm not arguing that the distribution was unfair. But the fact that the top 100 wallets control over 50% of the total coins isn't any less of a fact just because the distribution was technically fair
