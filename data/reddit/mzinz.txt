Cool, that helps paint the picture. Thanks for the info :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:59:55
Agreed on most points. On FOX though - of owned by liberals, why does it have such a strong conservative bias?
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:06:33
Look, I understand that you want Bitcoin to succeed, but you need to understand that not everyone knows as much as you about all of it. It’s a complicated space with a lot going on. 
Asking basic questions is how people educate themselves. Like the dude you were replying to, I also wondered why the wallet hadn’t been upgraded. 
The shit talking just pushes people away and is childish man. Just try and be cool and help educate.

Daily Show was absolutely more informative than most regular news channels IMO. For one, they frequently exposed hypocrisy within politics, and secondly, they would frequently cover a wide array of political events, as opposed to only digging into the hot “issue of the day” and ignoring all of other global news. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:19:55
You were the one who asked for proof. All he did was provide it to you. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:14:16
This isn’t surprising to hear at all for me. CNN, FOX, MSNBC will air any segment that will entertain people. Doesn’t need to be “fact rich” you could say. Daily Show’s entire shtick was to call out people and shows for being hypocritical. 
Just because it’s funny doesn’t mean it’s not true. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:31:36
Well, no. He provided data to back up his view. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:26:32
Ehh. Tone and facts are not the same, so I don’t think that argument holds any water at all. 
Do you have a source for the fake news retractions by CNN, CBS, and NBC from the last week?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:27:33
Where all retractions from the same Wikilinks event?
Still bad - but not as bad as each station with individual articles that were unrelated, which is what I had thought you meant initially. 
Thanks, cheers. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:53:44
Yikes. All bad. 
Out of curiosity, do you think that these networks publish more “fake news” than FOX News?
Also, do you think that the published stories were intentionally wrong, or that they just didn’t do their due diligence?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:30:35
What is your point here - are you suggesting that all polls are wrong? 
You understand that polls are just scientific estimates of larger populations. I think that all major polling organizations predicted Hillary to win, anyway, right?
Discrediting all science because of one anomaly isn’t a good position to take. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:48:18
I actually had the same thoughts as the dude you replied to, and I don’t even own BCH. 
Asking why the wallet developed by Core doesn’t have full functionality through GUI is a completely reasonable question. 
I agree LN should be prioritized, but it definitely doesn’t look good to not update the GUI. 
Regardless, the way you exploded at that guy is pretty insane. All the shill talk isn’t necessary man.

I've always heard what a dicker Roger Ver was but had never taken a stance since I didn't know enough about him. 
All I needed to hear was this one interview. He clearly does not care about the future of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:08:21
You’re right - they can be. This highlights the importance of using critical thinking to draw your own conclusions on if an individual poll is biased or not. 
The point I’m trying to make is that there are a lot of people discrediting this particular poll because they don’t agree with the **result**. This is the wrong approach. 
Cheers. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:38:59
Hahaha. Considering that news is what causes someone to be informed about politics, I would say that news stations would be a pretty good indication of causation as opposed to correlation. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:17:10
Thanks. Do you have sources for retractions from NBC and CBS?
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:30:25

If the mining slows, shouldn't that make existing coins *more* valuable since less will be entering the market? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:52:10
Where does their strategist post his predictions?
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:35:58
Thanks for your response. That completely answered my question and created several new ones.
I'll ask just one for now: it sounds like a couple things are needed to prevent manipulation in the future, 1) larger centralized exchanges, and, 2) market regulation. 
Is anything being done to address these gaps?
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:56:25
I didn’t realize that. Are there similar forks on other coins? Didn’t know that was possible - always assumed they would be 2 independent chains. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:37:58
Does this mean you have twice as many coins after the fork? Wouldn’t that double your money?
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:29:54
Can you add more detail on this? What methods do they use to manipulate? 
Are there clear examples from the past that I can look into to get a better idea?

Behind every bubble is a good idea bursting to get out, and Bitcoin kind of looks like a good idea, at least if you squint a bit. A digital currency without borders that governments can’t control and that allows secret online transactions? I’m in. Bitcoin itself? Not so much.
So is a single Bitcoin worth $500,000, $5,000, $500 or $0? I’m inclined to say $0, especially if Bitcoin’s value depends on it being adopted as a global digital currency to replace dollars. There is no chance whatsoever that Bitcoin can displace the dollar, for the simple reason that it is badly designed. Bitcoin can handle a pathetically small number of transactions, and uses an inordinate amount of electricity to do so, making it entirely unsuitable to replace ordinary money.


Even if Bitcoin worked better, it is in a Catch-22 because of Gresham’s law, the nostrum that bad money drives out good. Given the choice of spending inflationary government-issued money or something which holds its value, everyone would spend the bad paper stuff and hoard the Bitcoin. You wouldn’t want to be the person who spent 10,000 Bitcoins on two pizzas in 2010, when a Bitcoin was worth a fraction of a cent. Those Bitcoins are now worth $40 million. But if no one spends Bitcoin, it will never get established as a currency.


There are two somewhat less ambitious claims for Bitcoin that could give it value. The first is that it is a limited form of money because of its usefulness for dealing illegal drugs and dodging capital controls. The second is that it is a form of digital gold: an insurance that will keep its value even if governments confiscate or inflate away the buying power of the currencies they issue.


Let us unpack the idea of Bitcoin being based on illegal transactions. Dan Davies, a banks analyst at Frontline Analysts in London, came up with a value thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in limit of 21 million in circulation.
In any currency, the money supply multiplied by how often it circulates equals the price level times the number of transactions. For Bitcoin we can estimate three of the four variables, Mr. Davies says. He observed that even hardened criminals don’t set prices in Bitcoin, but rather in dollars, and then immediately convert. Assume that all drug dealing moves online, that Bitcoins circulate as fast as ordinary currencies, and estimate a $120 billion-a-year market for illegal drugs, and the formula spits out an ultimate value of $571 for a single Bitcoin. The more drugs traded, the higher the value, and the more Bitcoin hoarded rather than spent, the higher the value.


Drug dealers might be willing to put up with the limitations of Bitcoin, notably the uncertain time taken to complete a purchase and the high transaction costs. Laundering dollars is more expensive. But studies cited by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime suggest that cryptocurrency-based online drug dealing remains relatively small, and focused on retail, meaning fewer and smaller transactions than Mr. Davies’ limiting assumption, so justifying a much lower Bitcoin price.
On this basis the current price of $3,950 is mostly speculation, and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive James Dimon’s comparison to the 17th-century Dutch tulip mania is apt.
Bitcoin is “being driven all over the place by speculative portfolio flows,” says Mr. Davies.
Digital gold might be more appealing for Bitcoin’s true believers, who would surely prefer to avoid basing a currency on illegal activity. Gold is hopeless if you want to pay the mortgage or buy bread, but is useful insurance because we can be confident that if a government currency collapses the shiny metal will roughly hold its value. It helps that history holds plenty of examples of currencies losing all their value to hyperinflation while gold could still be bartered for food and shelter.


Gold has a value far above what is justified by its uses in electronics and jewelry only because (almost) everyone agrees that it has value. That “network effect” is what Bitcoin needs to establish itself, and the more attention it garners, the more likely it is to become established. Yet, gold has had thousands of years and a history of being used to back money to support its position. Technological disruption may be overturning many societal norms, but securing society-wide recognition as a safe asset takes more than the backing of tech evangelists and a bunch of get-rich-quick stock promoters.


Still, the potential to replace gold gives us some figures to work with. Thomson Reuters GFMS estimates there were 2,155 metric tons of gold held in exchange-traded funds. Switch all of that into Bitcoin and it would justify a price of about $5,500 for the 17 million Bitcoins currently outstanding.
We could be more optimistic and think Bitcoin might replace gold coins and bars. Leave aside that the gold is better than Bitcoin because gold doesn’t depend on having an electricity supply, and the 24,000 metric tons GFMS estimates have been bought for investment in the past half-century would justify a price of $61,000 for every Bitcoin.


If we assume that Bitcoin will either succeed completely in displacing gold or fail and be worth zero, it helps explain why the digital token has been so incredibly volatile, with a 40% loss in two weeks, and a 33% rebound since Friday’s low. Based on the simple choice between total success and failure, we can very roughly say that Bitcoin at 70% of the gold ETF-derived price suggests a 70% chance of displacing so-called paper gold as society’s chosen emergency store of value, and a 6% chance of displacing physical gold. Even digital dreamers should accept that is far too high.

Also wondering this

I haven’t seen anything that would suggest OMG staking will be worth more than $20, even with all of SEAsia on board. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:55:31
Simple - because it's all relative. A $100 loss to one person is emotionally as impactful as. $1000 loss to another. And it makes sense - people usually invest just as much as they are able to. 
It's better that way, too, because that way everyone feels like they are on the same ride, even if monetarily they aren't.

If the mining slows, shouldn't that make existing coins *more* valuable since less will be entering the market?

Sorry to hear that. The good news is that until it truly goes mainstream, it's not too late.

Why did you wait so long to get back in, out of curiosity?
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:39:22
It can be hard to search when you don't know all of the terminology. If the question is asked repeatedly, it should be in the FAQ or else it will continue. Thank you for the info, I get it now. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:37:32
The closest thing I found was in the FAQ: 
Is that 10min delay what you're referring to, or does another delay occur?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:33:46
I'm asking what prevents it from happening. Is this not a good sub for basic questions like this?
