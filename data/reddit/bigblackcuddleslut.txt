It's more about having the balls to live the way you wamt to live and enjoying it while you can.
Everything comes to an end.
Some choose to take the safe route and plan for the future so they can enjoy a comfortable retirement.
Some live like rockstars until the very end.
To each his own.  Kind of why goodfellas is one of my favorite movies.

Whether you agree with it morally or not.
High risk high reward.

Well yes, you did **refer** to desktops. Which yes, **are not** servers.
Do you even know what your point is?

So can you find hashes say, say below 000000fxxx and save them for when they are acceptable?

If you need a source for this, you really have no business in this discussion.

I don't think that's necessarily true.  Even if it was.  It wasn't in wide use in everyone's pocket.  PHD mathematics students haven't been known to have many warrants issued against them.
Computing only reached the general public in the mass market 3 decades ago.  Encryption only really became a thing that the general public might be interested in 2 decades ago.  And only ever even came close to being a mass market thing maybe a decade ago but not really.  Apple is arguably the first company to sell a device with it standard to milions(no tech skill required).
So while it may have existed and been available it was never really an issue.  Not to mention that if you think the government doesn't and haven't have mathematicians and supercomputers dedicated to working these things you are high.
It's only in the extreme recent history that a 16yr/old cracked head or an uneducated suicide Bomber could by a commercially available implementation that would befuddle the government. 
Plus, the FBI is clearly on a fishing trip.  They can decrypt the phone.  It would be expensive.  But the technology to read a chip(secure onclace) with an electron microscope has existed for awhile.  Hackers have used it to break consoles for Christ sake.  They can.  They just don't want to.
Edit.  I'm on my phone and started drinking.  So if I have become incoherent I apologize.

To be fair, that is exactly what he didn't say.  He was more of just talking about how technology changes things.  He never once said the government should prevent encryption.  The closest he came to it was saying that 


Now I don't think that is the right view.  I think the governments right to hold someone in contempt of a court order is more than enough to offset it's in ability to break encryption.  That said, he is simply talking through how technology has changed the game.  And here are two excerpts that directly contradict the idea that he thinks government should ban encryption.




I guess the reason I was compelled to commit, is, you took a speech made by a politician that was actually well reasoned and nuanced and all 100% technically correct, and reduced it to something the politician didn't actually say, and doesn't even really advocate.  We need more politicians that take this kind of stance on tech issues.  They shouldn't be punished for it.

Only, unless you are **not** in the United states.  It's a non issue.  The government can't ban encryption in Afghanistan.   Warrents don't apply.
The FBI case Is specifically about the public at large.  What is legally allowed in the country.  The president's comments were about what is allowed in the country.
It may be the issue.  But it's not what these comments were addressing.  Although I agree with you 100%.  Even if you banned it in the states that doesn't necessarily help anything.
EDIT:  DAMN PHONE!

Not at all.
The inability to forcibly enforce warrants is a wholly new thing.  Never before has it been this way.  That's all he is saying.
He admits he doesn't understand how encryption works but has been told that it is a binary outcome.  And if that's true, it will present real problems in the future.  ( I don't necessarily believe this is true, but it's not hard to imagine a situation in-which it is ) .
 What he did not say was 


That's just disingenuous BS.  It's what makes having intelligent discussions on issues impossible.
But it's funny how you changed your stance.  because not allowing keys controlled solely by the end user is not the same as banning encryption.  


No.  they don't.  He specifically did not say that in any way shape or form.  Putting words into his mouth does not further your cause.  It just makes it easier for the retards [  introducing bills to actually ban encryption ]( as if they could, to continue on there path of retardation.
