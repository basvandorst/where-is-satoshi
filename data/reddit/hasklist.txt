of course I post here after a few days kraken support silence.
ps: hachet -&gt; hatchet, Lrn2english before ask it from another.

Here my story: 
it's far less then 10k

this question about trading only cryptos, you have own rules, tire1: no need aml/kyc for _cryptos_ only. I deposit ICN and it's hold immediately.
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:47:36
The same with Kraken.
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:56:26
i agree what wirex have bad support, glad it's no need so often, but couple times support answer very long time, or no answer.
