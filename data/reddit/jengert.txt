LN is not a destination but a journey.  There are some using LN on the main bitcoin network; but much like bitcoin it self, and segwit; only slowly will it become more main stream.

I have never been good at explaining things;  shows the mean cost per transaction; an exchange will have lots of transactions a block.  It can group them together rather than a unique transaction for each output.
22 outputs 889 bytes $135.23 in network fee
42.33 bytes each $6.42 each, assuming one of those is money back in the exchange.
a transaction with one input and two outputs will be over 200 bytes, this brings down the cost to use bitcoin for those on that exchange.

Hope they offer LN payments if they really do come back

The protocol works in satashi not Bitcoin, adding another digit to the Bitcoin layer would take a hard fork.  2ed layer can do that if someone wants to.

Just guessing: more raw material is always created/mined, in the process, total wealth increases close to the rate that governments print money.

Thanks for raising that point.
Now I am thinking; is stability tided to adoption?  That seems to be what stores need to adopt.

GDP in 2014 was 482 billion USD, / 52 weeks is 9 billion.  1 billion USD is 107,000 btc. What I wander is if there is another large exchange?

Is the saw-tooth shape because some blocks clear out more transactions?

The Petro is a commodity backed currency, not fiat.  It is centralized, controlled by one government, but not fiat.
@_date: 2018-10-07 12:07:16
Thanks for the correction, still feel commodity backed is a step in the right direction.

The short answer:

not by much; assuming the silver reserve is still 1 billion try ounces.  The price of silver is 16.49.  Note this is not including all silver mined; that is close to a trillion.

It seems they have 16% of the blocks found.  This means they need it 85% easier to mine to keep the same 144 blocks a day.  How much more profitable will that make it?
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:46:02
Summer does that ;-)  I have a friend down there, maybe I should send her a little btc as a gift.

All news is misleading if you only read headlines.  I have only read the Forbs piece.  I did not feel they blamed BTC, they praised the IRS for following the one million Bitcoin address to the hundreds of actual users.  They talk a lot about the head of Welcome to video, how his library was the largest, which is why they are calling it the wolds largest  darknet of it's kind.

I agree with the problems of privacy, and add a logistics problem; incoming address is the only way to know which invoice is paid.  
There is no reason to limit your incoming addresses, unless you are really doing tips and don't need to prove payment.

I was waiting so long to post this one again.  You beat me to it fair and square.  I was too busy waiting to see how long it would stay over 10...  Didn't put an alert for higher.

If bitpay was on board, I could be saving money on my purchases.

You can export your key, from there you can sweep all your coins into a new address, like the exchange you will be selling them on.
electron cash wallet can sweep bch coins.

There are also diffident bit masks, that is used to ensure there aren't a lot of all black or all white spots.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:56:00
that does seem to be the source of this; but to spend money more than once a block is really fast!  For it to account for so much of each block confuses me.
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:25:41
If I set maxconnections to 0, will it still start? I want to use it just to run rpc requests of getrawtransaction and getblock.  I set it to 1 and it is Upgrading txindex.  I guess that is because I upgraded bitcoind?

Did you hear him say it may be worth something if a government gets behind it about 10:30?  He sounds as knowledgeable as most you tube experts.  Some good points that should be flushed out more before making such a long video on it.

As did I.

I mean a wallet will send to several people, each one with it's own transaction; in some cases 3 all confirming all in one block.  That's what it looks like.  Start here:
and click on spent, You will see all the money gets spent on about 16 sequential transactions all confirmed in the same block.  I figure there would be one like that in each block; but not hundreds.  A smarter wallet could send all of the money in one transaction as save on fees.  If a human was going from site to site, they would not be hitting buy more than once every minute or two.

45? Does China even account for that much on the trade volume?  The speed of this sell off seems extreme.  I have not seen a reason for the ban, no one has said Bitcoin is broken, or being used more for nefarious purposes.  Infact I have heard the opposite.  If China bans all minors as well as the Asic manufacturers, and does not provide a reason for doing so, no other country will ban it.
The problem here is not bitcoin, it's China.  I don't know what their problem is.

If you keep it on your own wallet, copy the wallet; and make sure next of kin can access the money in case of death.  If the money is not in your own wallet, it's more like a standard bank account.

Best case scenario, boot up the computer and see if the bitcoin-qt app is installed.  If you get that far, and know the password, you can spend that money.
If that's not the case, the money is probably lost.
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:11:03
I still like bitcoin-qt with backups on USB.  Losing the password is about the only way to lose your coins.

Maybe you requested money from a faucet early on? That happened to me.

True, when I want to sell bitcoin, I *spend* them.  There are a lot of stores I can do that at.

In my experience, it's still too new and too complex for either tech or financial gurus to understand.  I still see a risk of implosion, but I feel it's more likely to keep growing for many years.  I have a very small amount in Bitcoin, back when I bought it 5 years ago.
