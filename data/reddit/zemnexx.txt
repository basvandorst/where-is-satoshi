I've learned that this subbreddit is horrible for any sort of price prediction, because crypto can't be predicted. Its like anyone who just learned about crypto and TA has to give their input: 
"We will get a correction down to 8k!"
"This is bull trap, we have much further down to go."
"It will swing back up and go to new ATH's"
No one here knows what they are talking about and all these predictions are worthless. Just buy good projects and HODL for the long haul.

If not, you should be.

Poloniex is working for me, but it literally took months of waiting before they verified me. Apparently they are trying to go faster now, so good luck. Once you finally get connected to cryptowatch on Poloniex, it works fast and great. Some have issues with withdrawals, but every btc withdraw I have done was done in normal time.
 In the meantime, if you are using Bittrex, try using Leonardo as a trading terminal. It is a margin trading bot with a manual trading terminal. It was expensive but worth it for just the trading terminal for Bittrex alone. Just hope eventually we get Bittrex support in Cryptowatch.

Bittrex or Poloniex are the only acceptable ones. Or maybe Binance.

GDAX is good for only the big players, Bitcoin, Eth, LTC , and no altcoins. So if you don't plan to ever diversify to a wider portfolio, then it is good. But honestly, just go with Gemini then. They offer Bitcoin, and Eth, very low fees, and pre-credited deposits. Much better for just straight investing and hodl.

If you count $0 as a limit, than sure. Everyone has a limit. I'm going down with the ship because I didn't invest more than I'm willing to lose.

Don't know what your talking about, I have the same amount still. 
Obligatory 1 Doge still = 1 Doge.

So you mean, three years worth of time to stock up on cryptos? Dude, people will get rich all over again from the same price movement.

What are good alternatives to Bitpay for US citizens?

I gotcha, then yeah, look for people who specialize in other markets that aggregate news, they will usually mention crypto. They are typically not very positive about it.

I don't think you understand the concept...
They are long term bullish, which is why they are a crypto channel. Why would they be bearish? Do you want a crypto channel dedicated to down talking crypto and are long term bearish thinking it will crash because it's worthless? You probably won't find a crypto dedicated channel that is bearish because if they were bearish, they wouldn't keep talking about it. The big crypto YouTubers aren't perma-bulls, they talk about downtrends all the time. That's pretty much all they talked about till recently once the market started looking for positive. 
Try looking at traders in other markets that might have a negative opinion on crypto, like stocks, forex, or commodities that ocassionally cover crypto.

Haha wow. You are just trying to brag, you literally have no idea. Most people have plenty of work ethic, and those numbers still seem accurate. 15k in savings. Sure you did, you are so cool. I'm sure you did it all by yourself and received no help at any point, you lived in poverty too I bet, and just got through it with hard work ethic. I'm rolling.
You are either lying, or you are some bum who got lucky off some BTC and you think you're hot shit.
