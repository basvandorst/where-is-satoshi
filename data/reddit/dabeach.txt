As you can see there are tons of these .01 trades... I'd find it very strange that this many people are selling .01 worth. Must be DDOS via small trades.

No question, just want to say thanks for single handedly wrecking the bank accounts of most likely many people instead of assisting in bitcoins rise at a time when you were most needed.

The crash could again make a lot of people rich if enough people buy ala stock market 08/09.

I think the minimum needs to be something like .25 BTC or something unless of course the price gets ridiculously high. It is good that they suspended trading but they should have done it when it was dropping 50% in hours. I attempted to buy in at 140$ last week but my order pulled through yesterday at $250.... I lost about 700$ in potential value. That being said I am hoping this isn't to little to late. Hopefully some of those 18,000 waiting to get verified are bulls and will buy on this dip and get the price going.
