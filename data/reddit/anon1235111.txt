To make bitcoin the global currency other people would have to start getting some until this demand is created the price will not go into the millions. So by the time their are 100 Million users those hoarding bitcoins will want to sell to let the next 100 million in. We are aware that early investor have a chance at getting rich really quick but only if they cash out. Also at some point there will be a tipping point where no one will want to sell bitcoins for fiat because no one in the world will accept it.

Running a node at any time will help. It distributes the load and decentralizes the transactions more.

Your full node will be off when users on the other side of the world will be sending coins. So you will be helping the people closest to you.

It works by for each bitcoin burned the value of counterparty coins becomes greater.

No one here should tell you how to spend your coins, read read and read some more. If you want bitcoin to succeed spend them as you would with fiat and replace what you use.

Or realize if you bought/got your bitcoin anonymously then you have no reason to file taxes.
Secondly if I buy something with bitcoin and rebuy the same amount i just spent at the same price there was no gain therefore no taxes can be collected. 
Thirdly 15% on the gain not the whole amount so if you bought 1BTC at 100$ and bought something worth 120$ for 1BTC a week later. Then you pay 15% on the 20$ you "made" not 15% on the 120.

Open source projects work on donations. Not on funding without showing any code. Also you are asking for 100BTC in total isn't that a bit much since a open source project can have many developers and it might gain momentum and actually be taken out of your hands.

You are backing up the private keys. If you send the new money to a private key you have backed up you will be fine. If you send it to a private key that was not included in the back up you will lose it. Also when spending coins the bitcoin-qt wallet has 100 addresses pregenerated for change. If you make more then 100 outgoing transactions you might lose some of your bitcoins. You should back up regularly.

Again in this case instead of sending out money to do elections, use their own coin all they really want is a blockchain let everyone mine just one votecoin per address that is pregenerated for them and given out to the before the election. Also sending 0.0000001 of a coin would be considered a dust transaction and have huge fees and for a country like China 100BTC per election is a still a cost added the rest of the election costs (counting votes etc) simpler would be to make their own coin.

Sadly you cannot Antiviruses work via either definitions known strings of code that are rare enough in a virus to not throw false positives in normal code, and heuristics, actively scanning what a program does and flagging known "bad stuff". Now the bad stuff and definitions are provided by trusted CENTRALIZED third parties.

Your bitcoins are tied to a secret password called a private key.
Your wallet file keeps a list of all your addresses you own plus the private keys to spend the bitcoins in each address.
Due to the fact you need each version of bitcoin to read your private keys the developers built it in such a way that it is backwards compatible even if you upgrade. 
If you still have trouble understanding please specify what confuses you.

All the US has to do is temporarily redirect some supercomputers to launch an attack.
The US do not own supercomputers in that way you seem to think they are either leased from private companies for scientific research meaning to use them the US would have to fork out huge amounts of cash, or if you talking about the NSA server farms I don't think they would stop monitoring China and Iran's communications just to double spend a currency the FBI has planned to liquidate.

If the also cash out their BTC the moment it happens it will get lost in the mess. Say I buy something for 0.2BTC and they send 0.198 to the shop owner they have their profit there.
If I buy something at 0.3 BTC and it get placed into fiat they cash out at the exchange rate they offered the shop and keep the same 1% and on an exchange a 0.3 buy order will fall right into the blend.
Just buy something on BitPay and follow where the coins are headed using blockchain.info.

First you would have to find and finance VPS in those areas the best way resource would be google/duckduckgo. I assume you would want to invest in VPS providers that accept bitcoin.
The install process can be done via SSH on most VPSes, all we need to do is install bitcoin core on each instance and maybe run a quick script to get the recent blockchain from the torrent instead of taking the 3 days to download it normally. Everything can be done with BASH scripting or basic python.

Bitcoin doesn’t really disturb the drug hierarchy much, most drug dealers will only sell to close trusted friends and buy from someone who purchases in bigger amounts. It also matters what drugs you are looking at. Heroin is farmed in bulk in Afghanistan and smuggled in in 10Kilos at a time to biker gangs. While pot can be grown in closets of college kids and shared between close friends over cash and texts. Acid is manufactured in hidden labs where there are very few off and then sent via Fedex and paid for with any method that is pre agreed on.

Aspects of the Free Software community, like the Free Software movement, the GNU Project and its copyleft principle are a type of a gift economy for information and software; a gift economy is the preferred economic system of anarcho-communists.[139] Programmers make the source code of their programs available for anyone to copy, modify and improve. Individual programmers gain prestige and respect, and the community benefits from better software. Markus Giesler, in his ethnography Consumer Gift Systems, explored music downloading as a system of social solidarity based on gift transactions.[140][141] Some organizations such as online commons (such as Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Commons), wikis and Indymedia are held up as examples of functioning anarcho-communistic organizations.[139]

Even if they ban bitcoin how would you enforce that. Also stop living in the world where America is the only country 95% of users are not from the States, the whole European bitcoin economy would be continue business as usual. The 51% attack is feasible assuming the American government wanted to waste a lot of resources on that. If that happened I'm sure if everyone ran a CPU miner we could counter it plus other countries might help the fight against it. Banning the exchanges or shutting down domains might work but the P2P and face to face exchanges will continue at most bitcoin would raise in value as there is now a risk with using it.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

@_date: 2014-05-16 03:10:08
At the time of back up you would have stored all the private keys to the address you own, If you where to then create new public addresses and receive coins on them, they would be unrecoverable. If someone send you coins to a public address to a key that was backed up you would be apple to access is no matter when you receive the new funds.
As mentioned below qt-bitcoin stores 100 address for change transactions if you where to make more then 100 outgoing sends after you last backup you run the risk of leasing some bitcoins.

They might be selling some in portions on the hour on when there is a less then 1% cost, thus creating the profit. Since they do not process that many transactions at a time it would be hard to pin down what is a sell or a trade or another human buying coins on the exchanges.

If you can spare about $500, I would have them all install wallets and give them each $1 worth (leave a $1 paper wallet under each of their seats maybe?).
Then load 4 donation addresses (ex: Sean's Outpost, Electronic Frontier Foundation, The Seasteading Institute, and Khan Academy) side-by-side on blockchain.info. Have them choose to either scan the QR code of their choice and donate the $1 or keep the $1 themselves.
Watch in awe as the donations roll in on the blockchain.info interface.
Edit: Another idea for dispersing the coins to the audience would be to give $20 to 25 people and ask them to tip it around to the people near them.
Edit 2: For those with Apple phones, they can use Coinpunk.

1) As with all proper sites - we use 2FA and preserve anonymity but we'd like users to register with an email when signing up. How much of a barrier is this for you guys?
Barrier for me now I need another password make the login my payout address.
2) We have no min deposit or withdrawal but are thinking of incentivizing people to keep small sums on deposit by offering an interest rate. Would this work for you?
Interest is awesome
3) Unlike many other sites we don't ask you to play against the house. Rather all users roll against each other and the pots grow collectively larger as more people play. We run a bot (also provably fair of course) when there are not enough players in each round. Are you guys comfortable with this?
As long as you can prove it's fair I’m down
4) We're API based and would love to see several bots coming in. We'll even give out sample code to people who express interest in it. How valuable is this?
Much love for making gaming bot easy.
5) Should the site be as sterile as possible or can we be a little more playful with music and art?
Add music sure but make sure we can turn it off.

The fact of the matter is the early adopters are not in charge and never where we just managed to luck out. Some of us more then others check the original bitcoinforum messages from 2010 where they exchanged pizzas and the first stores to go up where filehosts and porn. This is a open ecosystem. Also take into fact bitcoin is international and your american-centric view will not apply on the macro level of this currency.

Not that much the demand for full nodes would increase as would users that are willing to host them. Bitcoin is very very scalable, things to worry about would be the inequality of satoshi's coins and the few early adopters that bought in at 0.06 cents each or before the first 30$ bubble.

You realize just asking to accept bitcoin is a waste of money, they have to train staff, research the tax laws for getting bitcoin donations and figure out how to convert to fiat to actually use it.

The amount fall for another too much until the next block reward split and it's estimated that by the time the reward is under 3BTC the fees shall be over 3BTC as we will have more transactions each day.
