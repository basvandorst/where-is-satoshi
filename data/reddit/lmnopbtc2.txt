The part where the blocksize limit is not taken away so that more transactions are allowed on the transaction network.

You need time to buy trezor.  You need time to accomplish most things.  You need trezor.  Spend the time.

Block chain.info takes hardly any time.  Its not safe, but I trust it with small amounts for short periods of time.  It may buy you enough time for that trezor to reach you.  You can also borrow someone else's trezor.  Keepkey also works.

Simple.  Your coins can't be frozen when stored offline using hardware wallet like trezor.  An exchange can freeze buys and withdrawals and sends.

Trezor actually saves you a lot of time and effort.  In the old days, you needed talent, skill and patience to create a safe wallet on uninfected machine.  This process took time and was not fool proof.  Trezor accomplishes this task very quickly.

Keyser Soze show your face!  The hacker was Satoshi all along I knew it!

Yeah if you have misunderstandings check out the HK roadmap and 2mb hard fork blocksize increase!   I was actually describing the next step after a successful Segwit release!   Exciting that things are moving forward and the transaction network called bitcoin is growing!  Hope this helps!
I actually think that both of us feel the other is confused.  I understand segwit!  My original comment was celebrating the progress on segwit towards release.  I also expressed excitement on what will be released next.

Nice.  We should raise the limit again in the future.  Fun.

1mb is great for today. 2MB is even better for tomorrow. Let's keep this cryptotrain rolling!  Increase the limit sooner rather than later!   It is definitely time for 2mb!   Let us all reevaluate after the 2mb increase!.   Reasonable steps!   Reasonable growth!  Happy times.
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:25:22
No no the 2 mb increase increases the variable blocksize limit!  Read up on it!
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:42:42
Nice!  Next step is to increase the currently hardcoded blocksize to 2MB.  Correct!  Looking forward to this!   This will allow more bitcoin transactions per second on the Bitcoin transaction network.  The transaction network is growing with both of these changes!  Great job!

Segwit increases the effective limit.  The actual limit currently remains 1mb despite the increase in space segwit effectively affords.  The 1 mb limit can still be raised.  Right?
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:19:55
Agree!  It will eventually be removed anyway.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:28:42
Well the other option is zero limit, letting miners decide appropriate sizes as time passes.  
2 mb will be great even if there is a small minority that oppose it.  Needing a hard fork after this 2mb hf is not a bad thing.  Hard forks and soft forks are NOT scary or dangerous, they are supposed to happen when appropriate.  In the beginning forks were not soft and hard they were just forks.  
If you are really really afraid of forks still . . . Then support a zero limit fork, taking the limit away as intended.  
The reality is a small group is afraid of forks, but the majority will move to 2mb once segwit is live.

Not worried, just looking forward to the step after segwit.  2mb hard fork will allow even more transactions on the bitcoin transaction network than what segwit affords!  Both of these moves will be great for the bitcoin community.  I'm not worried, I'm excited!   More transactions!  More users!  More fees for miners!
There is even a roadmap in place for these changes.  Don't worry it's all planned.  Read up on it.
