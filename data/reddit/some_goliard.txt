I think there was a thread here that talked about your gigantic fee. Someone did mention asking the pool to get it back. Glad that this was exactly how things unfolded :)

Even more normal in Vertcoin, one could even say it's the norm ! ah ah !
Ah ah ah

That's not what a sausage fest is, as far as I know

I think that maybe one we reach 21 millions, we'll implement the fractionning of satoshis

Good idea.

The same way you can make split keys I guess

That's kind of an ironic tragedy here.
People who are likely to correct facts and speak against negativity are the most likely to be inconvenienced by that kind of comments system
Tldr: comment system is doomed to fail and commenting is a stupid internet fad

Ever heard of fractional-reserve banking ? It applies to Crypto exchanges too
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:30:33
I've read enough on crypto technology, thank you and I stand by my statement. It is very possible that there are more "Bitcoins" circulating on the market than are truly available, especially with exchanges

So, THAT was the sound that came out of one of my numerous tabs

How could any gov't pull this off ?
That wouldn't even be taxing anymore but down right stealing

I doubt you could have send something by accident.
Is the address where you received the money compromised in any way ?
