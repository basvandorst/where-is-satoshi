Why do people think that the halving is going to increase the price per coin?
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:49:50
But coinbase already said today that they were implementing segwit and batching transactions. They also implied that they're working on lightning.
We got what we wanted.  Why do you want to punish them?
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:24:35
There seems to be confusion about how lightning works, so maybe this will clear it up:
You will have two wallets.  One which is "lightning enabled", and one which isn't.
Your non-lightning wallet will be your cold storage, and your "lightning enabled" wallet will be your hotwallet.
People talk a lot about opening and closing channels.  That is a technical description.  Imagine instead that you are just transferring funds between your hot and cold wallets.
Bitcoin made it so that you could be your own bank, and have your own digital cash.
Lightning made it so that you can be your own visa, and have your own merchant network.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:37:01
Perhaps what this means is that bitpay recieve addresses are now segwith addresses.  This should help with scaling, since nearly every bitpay transaction is followed immediately by another "sweep" transaction to move the coins into a general purpose wallet.

What is bitcoin legacy?
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:49:36
Okay!  That's good to know, will submit some bug reports.
My guess is that I closed the channel with so little of a remaining balance that it had trouble with the closing transaction.
Here's the problem there (maybe?) while the channel is in a closing state, it doesn't seem like I can open a new one to the same node.  This means a user could get stuck in a position where they burn a bridge to a lightning node/network.
Too little remaining sats to close it, can't open another one to the same node.  
(That is if I understand what is happening correctly)
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:18:57
Okay, so here is how I could see this going:
Coinbase has a lightning channel to *everybody*.  So if you keep you coins on coinbase, they remain in the channel.
This seems fine to me.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:55:25
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:41:20
Absolutely true.  Right now I *do* trust coinbase, but really (REALLY!) like the idea that I don't have to.
Sounds like there is a lot of money to be made as a lightning network provider...
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:58:35
So is this the flow?
1) Open channel
2) Xfer BTC in the channel
3) Transact in the channel
4) Close the channel (remaining BTC is xferred back to the originating address)
So lightning is almost like an escrow service?  Or maybe like an automatically refunding (funds that aren't used) gift card?
Okay so if that is the case (maybe I'm wrong about that)
1) What if only you close the channel?  Can escrowed funds get "stuck" in a channel waiting for the other party to close it?
2) Is there going to be a delay when the channel is first opened?  (Typical bitcoin-type delays)

Like it or not, the majority of people don't want to run their own wallets.  It takes for ever to download the block chain ("what the hell is a block chain!?"), it's dangerous ("I clicked a button and now my money is all gone!")
Hot wallets and cold wallets and soforth are confusing the majority of people.
There is a market for a company that manages your wallet, insures it, secures it, and makes it easy for you to trade fiat for crypto.
Coinbase fills this need (really really well, imho).
If anything, I'd say that paypal ends up competing with coinbase.  It's a logical move for them business-wise.
I say good.  I won't use them, but they have the clout and install-base to HUGELY push BTC adoption.

I look at buying and using BTC the same way that I would look at early investment into any tech startup.  Right now we're seeing some downtrends.  Fine, but I still ultimately believe that it will be a positive thing.
Either BTC will eventually be worth more than my initial investment, or eventually BTC will be worth $0.  I think there is a strong likelihood that it will be the ~~latter~~ former.

No.  No no no no.  The magic that bitcoin brings is that anybody *can* be a bank, not that everybody *has* to be a bank.
Coinbase offers services, but there is nothing stopping you from offering those same services yourself.
THAT is the magic.  It's like open source banking.
Let's even take this much farther than makes sense and say that we eventually reach a point where merchants require you to give them coins from "verified" originators, like coinbase.
EVEN THEN we're still getting the financial revolution that a lot of us want, because EVEN THEN we can still operate outside of that system if we decide to.
Right now we can't.  THAT is the problem.
Right now there is no "outside the system" mechanism for me to transfer or accept value from somebody.  I HAVE to use a third part like western union, or a bank.
edit: That last statement is an exaggeration.  I should have said: there is no practical way for me to efficiently exchange large amounts of value with the variety of people that wish to.  Obviously I can trade coins/knots/pelts/etc. with people in my immediate vicinity who will accept them as payment.

Bullshit bitcoin is fast.
I've had transactions take over an *hour* to complete from coinbase -&gt; bitpay.  That's fucking crazy.  That's like...1970s, chunk chunk carbon copy credit card crazy.
The answer to this is, unfortunately, centralization.  Coinbase has an agreement with bitpay, and all of the small (daily?  hourly?)  transactions between these two groups happen off-chain.
@_date: 2016-01-28 01:15:09
No it wouldn't, though.  They'd have to pay a fee to coinbase, or bitpay, or somebody else to get a similar product to what they currently get from visa.
The state of bitcoin right now is that transactions take ~10 *minutes* for their first confirmation (although anecdotally, I've had transactions from coinbase to bitpay take ~2hrs).
Visa takes a few seconds.

Why would they at this point?  The fees are higher than visa, the wait times are higher than visa, and the customer support is definitely more complicated than visa.
Scaling is THE issue, and all of the pathetic goalpost moving I have seen in this sub over the last few years is just giving up on what Bitcoin can be.

It's approximately equivalent to: "If you don't have cash in your backyard, you don't really own your money, the bank does."
This is true.  This is also more-or-less irrelevant to the adoption of bitcoin.
Having bitcoin "banks" like coinbase is a GOOD THING FOR BITCOIN.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:08:33
I'd say more like 2005.
The internet exists, but you still need a "webmaster" to make it work for you.
edit: to those saying I don't remember the internet in 2005.  Yes I do.  I have been a running linux servers and hosting websites since before then.  I just disagree with you that the internet was as mainstrem then as it is now.  My mom didn't have a smartphone back then, or a myspace.  Social media didn't exist in nearly the same way as it does now.  Does anybody remember trying to stream video in 2005 (this was the year that youtube launched)?
Howabout gaming online?  In 2005 still less than *HALF* of interenet users in the US had broadband at home.
Google had only gone public in *2004*, and when they did, their market cap was around $20 Billion.
The internet then was in its infancy compared to now.
I wonder how many of you actually remember the internet back in the 90s.  Because the ease of using bitcoin now vs the ease of using the internet back then are nothing alike in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:55:46
It's people who don't understand the tech well enough to make a real comment on it, so they fall into groupthink/tribalism.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:58:37
+1 this.  100% coinbase's operational security is better than yours.
Also if coinbase gets hacked and your coins disappear, you would have grounds to sue them and get *something* back.
Lose your trezor/seed/etc, or have it get stolen, and you're SoL.
The only benefit of a trezor over a coinbase vault, IMO, is if a fork happens.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:33:33
Coinbase is the real answer here.
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:34:48
Doesn't this mean that they're probably losing money on the withdrawls, then?
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:40:33
Because ethereum's market cap was approaching that of bitcoin, and bitcoin is a far *far* more mature currency that "normal" non-speculators use ever day.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:43:26
Through the coinbase app.  I was all excited because I was showing off BTC to some of my hackerspace-mates...and realized how, sorry for the strong language, but absolutely fucking stupid it is that it costs that much to send $0.01.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:03:01
This isn't Kraken.  It's bitcoin.  The transaction fees are absolutely absurd at this point.
To move $25 from mycelium into another account costs &gt;$2 at the *lowest* priority right now.
That is just absolutely ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:32:12
That's a terrible analogy, though.  Bitcoin is a digital good, and there is functionally no difference (or should be functionally no difference) in shifting 1BTC or 100BTC around the world.
A computer weighs more, requires more fuel, requires more space in a cargo plane, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:10:34
Well, this particular version of it requires that you have a web server sitting somewhere.
I can totes help you set it up, though.  You'd need an arduino, an ethernet shield, an LCD screen, and a serLCD module from sparkfun (make sure that the LCD screen and the serLCD module are compatible).
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:52:11
You can still get away with it on a couple of mailservers :)
Also this is invaluable knowledge if your a mail admin.

Honestly, I understand the underlying protocol, but a lot of my bitcoins will always stay in coinbase.
Just like my email will always be hosted by google.
I /have/ my own mailserver with postfix and courier-imap installed...it works pretty okay...
but mail is gmail's specialty.  Anything I'm doing security-wise is ultimately just playing catchup with them.
Same with coinbase.  The things they do to keep my coins safe are pretty freaking nuts.  It's much better than anything I think that I could realistically do.

"The Dragon Awakens" almost definitely is a reference to Chinese interest in Bitcoin.

Adafruit buys their arduino boards from their supplier using USD.  Until the entire supply chain supports BTC, then it's irrational to expect adafruit to buy their products with USD, but then sell then with BTC (and not immediately convert the BTC back to USD).
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:04:45
That is how it works.  You can choose not to pay a fee, but the transaction confirmation could take a long time.

First of all, I'm a huge bitcoin evangelist...so please don't take this the wrong way...
No, waiting half an hour for buying a shipping container, or even an $80k boat or something is not okay.  I imagine the transaction there...you buy your boat, you want to leave the dealership, and now you sit around for 30 minutes talking about baseball with the finance person?
Or I buy that shipping container on craigslist.  I go to pick it up, and then just sit there staribg at the dude for 30 mins after I pay him ?
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:49:21

Hey man, the power supply on that looks pretty bog-standard.
It looks like there is a barrel jack that interfaces with a transformer that plugs into the wall.  Can you take a picture of the bottom of the transformer?  It should say a voltage and current (max current) output.
From that, building you a new powersupply (or sourcing one from something else), will be really, really easy.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:30:37
Yes.  Set my own fee of 0.0001 and wait five minutes for the confirmation.
So instant!  The future!

Couldn't agree more.  Even for keeping myself straight...
I sent my hackerspace (Heatsync Labs: 14aTmbF5BBFsFWkTj4c3bWYGFcxJ8UNawh) some bitcoin to get us started, and it was...frighteningly easy.  There was no verification, it was just "type a number, press send, money is gone".
I could have easily fat fingered something, and sent them a LOT of money on accident.
I'd love it if sending coins required a google authenticator, or sms token, along with "You are about to send 0.1 bitcoins [$100] to 14aTmbF5BBFsFWkTj4c3bWYGFcxJ8UNawh -- enter your google authenticator code to continue".

That's fair.  I guess what I'm getting at is:
I want to pay for my morning coffee with bitcoins.  I also want to pay my bartab with bitcoins.
I really want the fees to be lower than visa cards because I want to be able to use that as a selling point to people when evangalizing to them.
