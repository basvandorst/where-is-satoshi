It's a blockchain – that means that each block builds on the previous one. Imagine that you decide to increase the block size and this causes problems. So you decide to fork again and decrease the block size – you have to create ugly-as-sin logic to deal with the special-casing of block sizes for block heights X though Y, otherwise clients could view those perfectly-legit-at-the-time blocks as invalid (too large). You also have to deal with different clients using different versions. Half your miners didn't upgrade? They're still potentially generating blocks that are too big until they get around to upgrading. Usually there's a height marker that defines the switch-over as a result to give people enough time to upgrade clients since you don't want to deal with that, but there's little doubt in my mind that a block size reduction would be the hairiest client version upgrade we've had yet.
If you think the debate for increasing the size was bad, imagine the debate for decreasing the size, given the drawbacks. You really just don't want to go there if you can help it.

Oh, I agree that consensus will happen before the change goes in. But you already have players right now threatening to double-spend substantial holdings in order to force fail a block size increase. With people threatening a nuclear option to maintain the status quo, you better believe that there will be even more shenanigans either threatened or actually happening if you do two rapid fire hard-forks in a row.

Well, maybe not a rating system so much as a system with a Nash equilibrium. In this case, adding more redundancy only helps if the other nodes aren't colluding. Which, given Bitcoin, they sure as hell will be if the reward is high enough.
Essentially, I control N nodes in the system, where N is really big (botnet). You ask for backup with 5x replication. I have enough nodes that all 5 replications end up on my network. I don't give a shit about your data so I store it once on a victim's machine. When you ask any of my machines for proof of backup, I find the single machine that actually has a copy and relay the correct hash. I get paid 5 times for storing once on a victim's machine and you're screwed when the victim notices they're out of disk space and decides to check for viruses.

The problem with speaking of "regulation" vs "deregulation" is that not all regulation is created equal. AML/KYC is a classic example of regulation that protects the banking industry while [regulation that limits the leverage of the bank]( by capping debt-to-equity ratios or other limits to how risky they can be through some other measure tend to be the sort of regulation the banks hate (but that protects the public). The fact that HSBC got caught violating the very regulation that protects their territory is pretty damning.

Eh, they ask for things (required field) that make no sense in Kenya, like street numbers. Kenya doesn't have those. And Kenyan ID numbers are only 8 digits for citizens. They're 6 for foreign resident cards, so their system is currently citizen-only.

Yeah, this is exactly it.
However, worth noting, SMS is a security concern because there are a very large number of extremely tech-savvy fraudsters who actively spoof SMS messages. SMS messages are unencrypted by default and it's very difficult to ensure that the person who sent you an SMS is really the person you think you're talking to. My understanding is that M-Pesa uses a secure element on the SIM card to encrypt SMS messages behind the scenes, but this isn't something third parties have the ability to duplicate without the use of a pass-through SIM-shim.
The Blockchain work-around for this isn't viable for Kenyan users in my opinion.

What banks opt to do does not necessarily win. payWave, PayPass, and ExpressPay are all single-factor and merchants have already started implementing ridiculously low per-transaction limits on them (like $50) because single-factor carries substantially increased fraud risk even if the underlying technology is more secure.

My local fiat is USD at the moment, but it will soon be a combination of KES and TZS. I do not expect that to be a convenient conversion for some time (although my employer is [bitpesa.co]( so it's kind of on us to fix that). Due to US banking regulations, I have a strong disincentive to hold a Tanzanian or Kenyan bank account however. I did that back in 2011/2012 and it was a shit show trying to get the information that the US Treasury department needed from my Kenyan bank. It's a cash-centric society anyways, so I'm not doing that again. Nothing about my situation is typical, and my motivations for using one payment system over another are also heavily biased by far more than just the convenience of that network since I have a direct profit motive involved in using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:59:00
We're actively investigating the use-case of donations to non-profits. Right now, the best scenario might be to send the non-profit bitcoins directly. They can sign up for an account with us and then cash them out to M-Pesa themselves using our service. At some point in the near future, we will probably be cutting the fee for NGOs.

You can probably find PDF images of what the brokers provide end-of-year. Basically the same thing. Start with the MtGox CSV export, since that's the easiest to work with. CoinBase probably requires OAuth+API access to do the same. Not sure about BitStamp, never looked into it. In my case, I also used Intersango at one point because MtGox froze my account, so no matter what I do, there are manual steps.
That said, I'm also a programmer and I already scripted the MtGox part a few months ago. So nope, personally wouldn't pay for it. Others might, but you're better off talking to merchants specifically.

The IRS doesn't care about fractions of a cent in realized gains/losses. If you're immediately converting to fiat, you treat it like any other fiat payment received.
If you're holding it, it's still not terribly complicated if you have an accountant. I'm reporting what I made on Bitcoin for 2013 and it's pretty straightforward really, as long as you keep all your buy/sell logs. The hard part is that a brokerage normally does this for you, but none of the Bitcoin exchanges really do. Definitely room for improvement there to help out those of us who go legit.

You send bitcoins, we pay out Kenyan Shillings via M-Pesa. Since there's no secondary exchange this would normally create a liquidity imbalance with bitcoin building up on our books, exposing us to volatility, and generally not being sustainable. However because we pay all our expenses in Bitcoin, it's much less of a problem while we're working on other projects that will resolve that more thoroughly in the long term.

I wish that number did have room to drop, but there are significant costs to do what we're doing that you're probably not taking into account. 3% is as low as you can go with a flat rate without hemorrhaging cash on 10 GBP or less transactions that people use to try the system out.

Article could have been balanced just as well without using all the FUD words. It's possible to talk about risks accurately without instilling fear. (Let's be honest, Bitcoin offers risks. Some of the same risks as the old system, and some new ones unique to cryptocurrency.) But for someone who doesn't have a clue what Bitcoin is, using a phrase like 'offers significant promise' right after the a phrase like 'digital anarchy' , you better believe all they will hear is 'the sky is falling and it's the hackers' fault', even if that's not what you actually said.

Hiya. CTO of BitPesa here. We would love nothing more than to become unnecessary. But to become unnecessary, we first need to offer the services we're offering. BitCoin makes us obsolete by being adopted on both sides of the equation. Right now we service only one direction, but we have to do both or we have a liquidity imbalance. Once both the incoming and outgoing segments of a given remittance market have adopted Bitcoin, obviously yes, it's trivial to cut us out, and Bitcoin's promise to help the marginalized will have been realized. But you get there by making Bitcoin accessible, and that's precisely what we're trying to do. 3% is the absolute bare minimum you can realistically do what we're doing for while still complying with regulatory requirements. If you believe that offering a service just shy of at-cost is the behavior of a 'vulture', well, I'm not sure what argument is going to convince you. But so far our customers have been overwhelmingly happy with the speed, efficiency, and cost of what we're providing.
@_date: 2014-04-08 05:20:53
Love the optimism, and there's growing excitement locally, but Bitcoin in Africa is going to be complimentary to fiat, not replacing it anytime soon, even in places with distressed currency issues. There are lots of ways to make Bitcoin accessible to even your average Nokia 1280, but has the right category of criticisms here and the author of the original article clearly hasn't spent enough time in the developing world. I was pretty disappointed in the overall tone of what he wrote ("Some of these countries are unheard of!"), but I guess not surprised by this kind of output from a self-described "17-year old Bitcoin analyst".
Personally, I'm incredibly bullish about the potential for crypto-currencies as a broad category helping to solve many of Africa's financial challenges (almost certainly inclusive of crypto-currencies that don't exist yet). However, on-blockchain Bitcoin transactions aren't fully viable today in Africa for ground-level commerce. Here's a brief list of reasons why:
1. The blockchain is big when you're talking about mobile phones. Everyone in Africa is on a pay-for-usage plan. The blockchain is about 16MB today; you can partially pack that into the client or download it after, either way, if it's not a cloud wallet, you've got to get it onto the phone. At today's data tariff, that costs the consumer 20 KSh. That might not seem like much, but it's about an hour's wages for your average Kenyan. Much of Kenya does not consider that insignificant; particularly among the perennially unemployed (somewhere around 40%).
2. Confirmation time is great when you compare it to something like an ACH transfer, but most of East Africa has pretty good market penetration on mobile money services that work just fine and will confirm a payment in 10 seconds or less. Against that, Bitcoin is less appealing for your typical small transaction happening face-to-face.
3. Phones get stolen frequently by force. On-phone Bitcoin clients that store the private key locally have the obvious vulnerability that if your phone disappears on you, your balance goes with it. Yes, you can have backups, but in Africa, that's going to be most people's sole computing device. I have doubts that paper backups could be generally viable; phones can't print and paper doesn't survive well in your typical African setting. Wallets usually have a PIN/password so at least the balance is almost certainly inaccessible to a mugger, even if it's lost to its rightful owner, but that's small consolation to the victim.
4. Bitcoin addresses are effectively untypeable on a feature phone and QR code support is only occasionally present on the cheaper phones that most people are using. You simply have to support address look-ups by email address or phone number. You can potentially stick a QR code sticker encoded with your address on the back of your phone for the people who do have QR code support, but who's going to give you the sticker?
Kipochi does a really admirable job of solving most of these challenges pretty well, but even so, I still can't open a mobile web app on my aforementioned Nokia 1280 and only the most modern web browsers on flagship smartphones will give you access to the device's camera for loading a QR code. Additionally, unless more BTC/altcoin companies enter the market, you run the risk of centralization if one company becomes too successful in a particular locale. These are markets where network effects are particularly strong and the off-blockchain issue can make this a thorny problem in the long term.
The biggest challenge, however, is not so much a weakness of Bitcoin but rather the relative strengths of existing mobile money systems in the market. And with the exception of the infrequent hyper-inflationary economies, Bitcoin has a lot of work to do before it's going to be able to make the claim that it's much better than M-Pesa, Airtel Money, MTN Mobile Money, etc for their core use-cases. The biggest thing right now that Bitcoin does much, much better than mobile money is inclusiveness. However, that's a much easier thing to explain the advantages of to engineers and business people vs trying to explain it to consumers. If we're being realistic, "democratizing finance" just doesn't sell itself well enough yet unfortunately.
Worth mentioning as context, given the discussion, Zimbabwe no longer really prints its own currency and uses the dollar and other currencies in lieu. It does run into a lot of problems with demand for those currencies however, as cash is often scarce to a degree beyond what its face value might imply. Coins in particular, as they're heavy and problematic to ship, and the metal is often worth more than the coin as it is. Moving that metal halfway around the world is essentially never worth it. Stores use 1 cent pieces of candy to make change.
Incidentally, Somalia is, counter-intuitively, maybe not the best example of where Bitcoin is likely to do well on the basis of inflation as the Somali shilling has been appreciating lately due to a variety of factors, most of which boil down to "things suck less now". It is, historically, however, an instructive example for why Bitcoin works. In the 1990's, the Central Bank of Somalia, along with the rest of the government essentially went defunct. This left the country without a currency backed by fiat. Several other groups tried to step in and provide a currency in lieu of the Somali shilling, but as with any scenario where you mix instability with printing money, it did more or less what you expect. The interesting thing is how consumers responded. Instead of accepting the new currencies as valid, they kept using the old bills printed with dates prior to 1991 (that were no longer backed by anything but scarcity). Anything with a date after that was not accepted. Suddenly you have a roughly fixed monetary supply (counterfeits notwithstanding) and commerce could resume. Perhaps not the most stable commerce, but it's a good example of an unregulated currency going mainstream.
Disclosure: I work for [BitPesa]( Obviously I think Bitcoin is pretty great for international remittances where the larger average transaction sizes and higher tolerance for confirmation times plays well to Bitcoin's strengths.

I do agree that Overstock's volume is pretty small. Most other merchants haven't really published numbers though. I personally have spent under 5 BTC on goods/services – despite having a strong personal preference for vendors that allow me to spend with Bitcoin – I'm paid in BTC and thus I have a strong incentive to spend in BTC. A big part of the problem for me specifically is that the things I actually spend money on still aren't available for purchase via BTC.

@_date: 2014-06-15 17:47:16
The simple reality is that all financial transactions everywhere that are perhaps sub $10k in size have about the same cost to move. So from somewhere in the vicinity of $15 through to $10k, you're covering your per transaction costs. You still have to cover salaries though, which is 4 people for us right now, and that's hard to evaluate in the context of a transaction. So larger transactions and the associated larger fees help to cover our costs that aren't attached to a transaction (salaries, lawyers, hosting, contracts, etc).
There's costs attached to sending money to an M-Pesa account, Coinbase merchant fees (which aren't strictly necessary), costs associated with AML/KYC, and customer support costs for problematic transactions. We'll be doing whatever we can to reduce this overhead of course, and in some cases we have been willing to pay a little extra to get better user experience or to get the product to market faster. The expectation being that incremental improvements will resolve that over time.
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:02:11
Pretty much – as long as merchants are all configuring their BTC payment integrations to immediately cash out at market price, there's going to be significant sell-side pressure. The big merchants who adopt are all nervous about volatility. Every new Dell or Expedia that starts accepting BTC is going to drive prices down further. People get excited about things like PayPal announcing support, but the reality is that the bigger the integration the more it's going to hurt the price in the short/medium term. You need more people buying BTC for the purposes of spending it to counter balance the sell-side pressure from the merchants. If the bulk of the people spending with the merchants bought their BTC or mined their BTC awhile ago, the net price movement from a new merchant integration will be negative in the short/medium term.

Of course not. I buy lunch at the diner around the corner from my house that accepts Bitcoin primarily because they accept Bitcoin. I don't actually like diner food that much. My larger point is that we don't always approach these situations as strictly rational actors. Not every payment decision is made that way. If it were, nobody who believed Bitcoin was headed "to the moon" would ever spend it. I'm extremely bullish on Bitcoin long term but I spend Bitcoin at the diner instead of the much tastier breakfast place next door because the breakfast place is cash only and that's inconvenient and because I want to encourage businesses that do accept Bitcoin. Hell I even tip more when I pay with Bitcoin.
All that said, OP isn't entirely wrong. There are a lot of things about Bitcoin as a payment system for point of sale that are vastly far behind things like say, Square. And for merchants, that 10+ minute confirmation time is a serious problem if you don't trust your customers. Hell, the aforementioned diner just has a laminated QR code. They look at **my** phone to see if I actually paid. This is a system in its infancy at best. And not everyone wants to use a payment system in its infancy.

We currently monitor accounts using known Tor/Proxy/VPN IPs and that provides a strong signal to our risk systems, but it doesn't automatically generate a ban currently. If you upload your ID and use an identified account, we may have some additional questions about whether that's really your real ID if you're coming in via Tor, but we also recognize that maybe you just forgot to turn Tor off.

So I was curious about this, and I found that their exchange rate was worse (very slightly) than ours for both large and small transactions to M-Pesa (much more dramatically so for small transactions). However, they quote two amounts and the smaller amount (not inclusive of fees) might appear to be a better rate if you didn't notice there was a second number that was the actual total inclusive of fees.
300 KES
* WorldRemit: £3.03
* BitPesa: £2.08
30000 KES
* WorldRemit: £217.58
* BitPesa: £208.16
(As of July 29, 2014 @ 18:10 UTC)
However, if your cost to acquire bitcoin is high, WorldRemit might still be the better option for you. But BitStamp via SEPA is usually pretty inexpensive.

Coinbase has a nascent European presence. They're currently our order processor but of course there's no requirement that customers use them as their wallet provider. And as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, we are actually in the process of registering with FinCEN and the various state bodies and actively looking to enter the US market. We just have to make it clear that we're not marketing to US customers until that process is completed.
That said, there's plenty of reasons why we might move to a more decentralized approach in the future and indeed we could flip that switch tomorrow if we wanted to. A big downside to Coinbase order processing is that it happens in an iframe where there's no access to the DOM and with our target market it helps to be able to do visual callouts on a per-element basis for first-time users; "this is a QR code, you can scan it with your phone", "this is a bitcoin address, here's what that means", "click here to launch your desktop wallet", etc.

Yeah, there was a bit of glossing in the video. You cannot send money with BitPesa from sanctioned countries. And we're actively looking to open up to the US, but in the meantime we have to be really clear that we don't market to US persons until we've dotted our i's and crossed our t's.

I don't even know where to begin. You do realize that all the "pretty" in a web app comes from CSS right? And unless you were planning to go with an unstyled Times New Roman interface, you have put at least some CSS in. Once CSS is part of the mix, the attack surface is essentially the same regardless of the level of "pretty" in the application. And you generally don't seriously consider CSS a security risk in Chrome (older IE is a different story).

Hi, CTO of BitPesa here. It depends on what type of transfer you're doing, if there's a middleman, and (if applicable) how much the middleman charges. Charges for transmitting to mobile money accounts end up being anywhere from 60 KSh on the high end to 3 KSh on the low end. The official tariff schedule is [here]( but does not include fees from the middlemen. Our 3% take is meant to cover transaction costs like this as well as the one-time costs of identity verification.

This is sort of true, but only sort of. Identity verification services are EXPENSIVE. Lots of $ upfront and then ongoing fees for each check. Nobody can afford to check identity stuff on a truly ongoing basis. About once every six months is about as often as anyone can do it and still make money on the services they offer unless they have direct access to the various ID check databases and don't need to go through a third party. And in practice, that's usually about as often as checks actually happen.

You know, everyone says that, but I really don't buy it. Organizations are made up of individuals. What often appears to be malice is usually just organizational bias. I carry with me the organizational biases of all my previous employers, and regulators are no different. The regulators are all former bankers. It's not malice against Bitcoin so much as that they know and are comfortable with banks-as-they've-known-them. Pull the rug and they may not even be upset that the rug has been pulled but they're sure as hell going to try to return to what they're comfortable with. Prosecutors, meanwhile, care about conviction rates above all and cannot be reasoned with. So when regulators give prosecutors an inch, they take a mile. There's no conspiracy, but it sure feels insidious.
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:48:04
Well, there are reasons why you might still use Western Union, roughly in descending order of importance.
1. You've never heard of BitPesa or Bitcoin.
2. You don't have any Bitcoin to send and find it hard to acquire and/or use.
3. Your recipient doesn't have a mobile money account to receive with.
4. Your recipient's local mobile money cash agent never has liquidity to cash them out.
5. You're sending more than £400 at a time and you don't want to split your transactions up.
That last one may require more explanation. That's a limitation of all receiving mobile money accounts in Kenya. You can send two max-size transactions per day through before you hit the withdrawal/transaction limit. And you need to coordinate with your recipient to do £800 in a day because they need to withdraw the first transaction before the second can be sent. Not exactly convenient.
My wife still sometimes uses Western Union in preference to BitPesa for her NGO work for this reason. I probably shouldn't say that, it's not exactly a ringing endorsement. But be assured that we do know what needs to be fixed and improved and we know what we need to do to get there. Our whole company "eats our own dogfood" and most of us even transfer a good chunk of our salaries (paid in Bitcoin) through BitPesa.
The improvements we need to make are happening. A migration off from the remittance providers that rule the roost today will not happen overnight, but we believe it's an inevitability – if not us, then someone else – but we'd sure like to lead the charge.
If you think what we're doing is important, issues  &amp;  are things the community can help out with. If you haven't already, go and set up an account on LocalBitcoins and charge people a fair rate. At the very least, offer a refugee discount. If you charge spot+15, Western Union is still a much better deal. Please find a better way to reduce your risk – overcharging just tells people that Bitcoiners will gouge them just as badly as Western Union does, given the chance. Advertise your services with refugee resettlement groups; go to barbecues, make new friends, learn what the pain points are for sending money home. You may be surprised to discover things like hawala are quite popular. In many cases, Western Union and MoneyGram don't get used as often as a trusted member of the community that acts as a hawaladar. If we want Bitcoin to be used for remittances, the Bitcoin community needs to be involved with and trusted by the communities that are remitting.

Use the [Incognito Regex]( extension because nobody's ever going to remember to open Coinbase in Incognito Mode every single time.
Add 'coinbase\.com' to its regex list (found in the extension options under Tools-&gt;Extensions). That will cause Coinbase to only ever open in Incognito Mode where extensions are disabled. You could install all the malware Chrome extensions you wanted (not that I recommend doing this) and your Coinbase account would still be safe.
In fact, the Incognito Regex extension itself could be malware and I'm pretty sure you'd still be OK as long as you weren't signed into Coinbase at the time of installation.

We did have a service interruption a few days ago. It was fairly brief though and has since been resolved. On my to-do list is to auto-detect any interruption with our payout system and notify users before they attempt to send a transaction through. However, our setup works as a queue and will periodically retry any transaction that doesn't go through to M-Pesa until it finally does. It's an unfortunate reality that many systems in Africa that we need to integrate with have less-than-great reliability. However we have structured logging in place that tracks most issues with more than enough detail to resolve. We're usually right on top of any 'stuck' transactions, but if there's something that our early warning systems don't flag, just send us a quick email at support and we'll do everything we can to take care of it. Your money is your money and we have a responsibility to get it where we said it would go. If something happens and it doesn't arrive, tell us! And hold us accountable if our customer service isn't stellar, because that's what we're aiming for!
That said, I'm fairly sure the issues you were having were with a different company, Kipochi.

We already have an equivalent to the Bitcoin Foundation for East Africa and another in South Africa. You should check in with the [African Digital Currency Association]( The Bitcoin companies who operate here are members and we cooperate with our outreach efforts there. Most of what you've said you'd like to do has either already been done or is already in progress. The payment providers that service the hotel and tourism sector already know about Bitcoin and there is significant interest and activity there already. Jumping in and trying to help when you have no knowledge of the existing efforts is confusing when the people you decide to talk to are already talking to someone else about the same thing. It's important to manage conversations carefully in most cases. Not saying you can't or shouldn't help, but you should actually reach out to the people who are already here and very actively working in the space so that efforts are not duplicated, or worse, derailed. The Bitcoin community in East Africa is well organized, we hold regular meet-ups at the iHub with ever-growing attendance. The last one I was able to make it to was packed, standing-room-only.

How will Augur keep itself from running afoul of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission? Because from where I'm standing, I'd say you definitely fall under their purview. The only reason the IEM markets got a non-action statement from the CFTC is that they were operating in a not-for-profit capacity under an academic institution. You might be able to get approved for "eligible contract participants" (&gt; $5m in assets) but I don't see how you'll get any market liquidity with that kind of a restriction on you, plus burden of proof re: contract participant's eligibility is probably on you, not on them. You do at least get to avoid all the issues around funding accounts since Bitcoin neatly side-steps the historic problems with banks declining to complete those transfers, but I don't think it actually makes what you want to do legal. Also keep in mind that event futures "contrary to the public interest" are explicitly illegal due to possibility of a market participant initiating the event in question (contract based on chance of war, terrorism, assassination, etc). Contracts probably need to be explicitly used for the purpose of hedging or pricing utility if you want to avoid being squashed unceremoniously by the CFTC.

Agreed 100% that bloom filters, as typically configured, don't have the necessary properties to preserve privacy, but I recently was looking at a really interesting paper talking about the general case of this problem (though I don't remember where I found it) that framed the problem of linking in terms of perfect privacy being equal chance of a key being associated with a given message, and imperfect privacy being anywhere lower than that, and finally no privacy being absolute 100% chance of a link. In that context, it becomes more clear that false positive rate is directly correlated with privacy/non-linkability and perfect privacy could only ever occur with 100% false positive rate, while perfect delivery accuracy could only ever occur with perfect linkability. The rest is essentially a trade-off.
Given that bloom filter linkability would only ever increase with subsequent message delivery, if you want it to provide privacy, you have to recycle the bloom filter after a certain number of deliveries and perpetually keep the false positive ratio high at the cost of bogus delivery.
Not only that, but if there's any kind of ACK subsequent to receipt, you have to make sure that happens completely independent of processing the message or you torpedo privacy via timing attack. (e.g. "That message isn't intended for me" = 5ms, "Yes, I can decrypt that" = 15ms, followed by some acknowledgement message back to the server.)
I strongly suspect that any false positive rate high enough to preserve privacy meaningfully would be high enough to adversely affect a network unless message sizes stay very, very small.

Why? Because any currency is still strictly better than an economic system based on bartering.

He'd probably get it. But everyone else would be like, "We can't tax it? Fuck that."
If you want to give Kenyans a Bitcoin client, the way to do it is to use a SIM card pass-through shim. You punch a corner of the SIM card and put a tiny chip in the punched hole with a thin plastic shim that covers the SIM contacts. It lets you add new stuff to the SIM Toolkit menus. Basically you can create applications that will run on a dumbphone without asking permission from the carrier. Only trick is, you can't ever update them.

The government has already informed mobile money providers that this tax implies that a fee must be charged and taxed. You can't not charge a transaction fee now. If you intend to do business legitimately, the tax has to be charged. Bitcoin doesn't really give you a way to collect taxes on transactions, and so the government will act aggressively to ban it if it gains any traction. That means it can only exist as an underground phenomenon, and the Kenyan population simply isn't tech-savvy enough for there to be any chance of that happening at all.

Let me clarify what "legal reasons" means for big companies. It does not imply, "We think this would be illegal." It *can* imply that, but more often it implies, "Product counsel looked at this opportunity and found risks X, Y, and Z. We expect there will be lawsuits which will cost the company X′, Y′, and Z′. An optimistic estimate of the total revenue we can draw from this opportunity is $N. Unfortunately, $N is much less than X′, Y′, and Z′, so we won't do this for 'legal reasons'."

Yes, I'm inclined to believe that it's accurate that a lot of the import/export stuff going on is off-the-books. However, the transactions are not happening remotely. They're being done in-person. Someone flies to China or India, buys the goods, flies back with them, dodges customs officials, and sells them at a hefty mark-up.

Well, hold on here. I'm sure the situation would be entirely different if Africa had the kind of banking system in place that the US has. But here, the banks will gouge you for every penny they can get their hands on, so the overwhelming majority of the population sees no need for a bank account. I can't even tell you how many people quite literally do hide money in their mattress here.
I'm actually not at all convinced that BitCoin is a better currency than the US dollar. But a better currency than most of the paper that gets printed in Sub-Saharan Africa? You betcha.
I have somewhere around 1.8 million Kenyan Shillings among my assets. If there was an exchange that would let me trivially convert all of that to BitCoin with less hassle than the current conversion to US dollars, I'd do it in a heartbeat. The purchasing capabilities of BitCoin when compared with the Kenyan Shilling are already quite favorable.
I think the main problem BitCoin proponents have is that they're trying to compete against the wrong currencies. BitCoin doesn't compare favorably with the Dollar, much less even the Rand. But there are a ton of currencies I'd never want to hold. The Kenyan Shilling is just strong enough that I'm not terribly upset that I'm stuck holding it, but I wouldn't dream of holding paper assets in Ethiopia or Zimbabwe or Somalia.
@_date: 2012-11-12 17:11:00
Also keep in mind that it has to run on a Nokia 1280. You can't download the blockchain locally, because that'd be too expensive, and you can't centralize it and operate via SMS/USSD/STK commands because then the government does everything they can to banhammer it. And believe me, Safaricom will happily cooperate with a court order to block a potential mobile money competitor.

Too bad the rest of the article is utterly silly.
@_date: 2012-11-12 16:43:45
No... Safaricom/M-Pesa charges 10 shillings to move 100 shillings, and 30 shillings to move anything larger, up to 35,000 shillings. That's a hell of a lot cheaper than what you pay to use your credit card (best case scenario there is 20 cents + 2.5%, but often quite a bit more). The banks here wouldn't even dream of letting you make a transaction that small. One reason why so many people here are unbanked.
The government is moving to tax these transactions because the KRA is absolutely shit at collecting taxes from a population for which it barely has any records at all. Because they can't effectively collect taxes directly, they have to tax the electronic movement of money instead, because at least that's centralized. c.f. the recent decision to start taxing landlords on income earned from rent. The tax always existed, but it took them 49 years to figure out how to correlate landlords, properties, and tax returns.
The blame does belong on the government. It's a short-sighted maneuver because it will reduce badly-needed competition in the space. (Safaricom has an effective monopoly on both telecom services and mobile money in Kenya.) Essentially, the Economist got it right, but for the wrong reasons.

@_date: 2012-11-13 07:07:13
Sure, it's possible. But as someone who spent the last year and a half working on precisely this problem, I assure you that the problem is lack of demand. We did tons of research, interviews, etc. and it was abundantly clear that people don't want the internet or anything it offers because they have no idea what it can do for them. It's a lack of knowledge that's at issue here, not an inability to pay. If there was demand, someone would find a way to make it happen. And yeah, Bitcoin is one way that could happen, no question. Maybe not the best way, but certainly one way. But it's irrelevant because the demand issue has to come first.
@_date: 2012-05-08 08:53:13
They kept emphasizing the difficulty of obtaining transaction records, but it seems to me that, if anything, Bitcoin makes getting those rather a lot easier than other transaction mechanisms criminal elements might employ, given the public ledger system. Of course, the public ledger system probably doesn't actually give law enforcement exactly what they want, but it's a lot easier to track than say, cash changing hands on the street.

The destruction of Bitcoin is unnecessary and wouldn't produce the intended effect anyways. Governments only want to ensure Bitcoin's (and other cryptocurrencies') irrelevance.

No attempt will be made on the technical side unless it becomes a US or Israeli national security issue.

Well, the transactions it orphaned are pretty freaking massive.
@_date: 2012-03-23 05:06:24
For this to happen, several things would be necessary:
* BTC would have to enter the market somehow, either by mining or a significant initial investment by someone. Likely both.
* For wide adoption, a Bitcoin app would need to be developed that could run on a SIM chip. This can be done with a clipped SIM and a shim. However, delivering updates to the SIM app would be a real challenge.
* Exchanges would need to take the form of a peer-based agentless network until critical mass is reached. This solution would circumvent premature regulation.

I know the Bitcoin community gets really excited about their low transaction processing costs, but time is money. If it takes me three weeks to acquire the Bitcoins in the first place, that's a serious issue for anyone considering adoption. Right now it's not possible to acquire Bitcoins in Kenya without mining them. I've got a frozen accounts on every single major exchange to prove it.
@_date: 2012-11-12 17:01:58
Don't get me wrong, everything you said is why I became interested in Bitcoin in the first place. But e-commerce doesn't work for physical goods here because shipping is a year's wages and there's no functional mail system anyways. And nobody in Kenya actually pays for online services. It's a solution in search of a problem.
It's a semi-reasonable way to transfer and store value, but unlike many other African countries, Kenya isn't really experiencing major inflation issues. The exchange rate's been pretty steady for the last year or so. There was a big spike about a year and a half ago, but it came back down. So the need isn't as great as you're making it out to be. Plus, a significant fraction of the remittances happen in-country, with the transfers going from urban to rural areas.
For Bitcoin to work here, you'd have to convince agents in rural areas to pay people cash in exchange for Bitcoin. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2012-09-07 10:15:41
Also be careful about verifying a Mt. Gox account while holding a balance with them. If for any reason they decline to verify the account, you'll be flagged and the funds frozen.

They can and they do. It's taxed as a commodity/asset with a fluctuating value. Which is annoying because it means that literally every single transaction you do in Bitcoin is a taxable event.

You should assume that exchanges report stuff to the tax man. They might, they might not, but you should assume that they do.
Not paying taxes owed is called tax evasion and it doesn't matter how much of a crypto-cyber-anarcho-libertarian you are. It's still illegal and pleading 'ideological objection' is not going to keep you from having to pay penalties and/or serve jail time for evading taxes.

Yeah, regulatory environment in Kenya is a little more clear-cut. You'll probably need to register as an open payment network at some point though. Google's Beba was able to register as a closed payment network and avoid the bulk of the regulation because they support only transit payments, but I suspect you won't be so lucky. Keep in mind that people very high up in Kenya's government have significant financial stakes in M-PESA and will likely move to block anything they see as a threat (via the usual regulation angle). It won't matter whether it's a real threat or not. Best way to deal with that is to beat them to the punch and get all your I's dotted and T's crossed.

See the link her provided for why you shouldn't use firstbits.
You're headed down the right path, IMHO. Strict anonymity is unnecessary and indeed counter-productive for a service targeted at a broad consumer base like yours. As long as you provide a way to generate a secondary address that's not associated with identity information, that should be sufficient.
@_date: 2013-07-12 20:31:00
The value proposition for Bitcoin is not cost. The reason Bitcoin is disruptive is that I do not have to ask permission to participate. If I decide I want to send BTC I hold to some other address, nothing can stop me without herculean effort. No bank can freeze my funds and no government can prevent the transfer without laying siege to an entire economy. BTC today has many hidden costs that prevent it from competing strictly on that basis. It will have those same hidden costs for however long as it takes to reach absolute ubiquity and it's erroneous to look only at transaction costs here.
@_date: 2013-03-21 08:17:07
And if you feel you absolutely must do it client side for some reason, use something well-established and well-understood like the Secure Remote Password protocol. Only trick here is that these days you probably want a computational difficulty scaling factor in your hash, and most implementations of SRP won't support that. That puts you in the very dangerous territory of DIY security.
Seriously though, just use SSL and do it server-side.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:24:36
Someone's either doing it wrong or exaggerating. Probably more the former, because I've seen 7s intermittently in extreme cases before, but that requires some seriously awful code to produce that behavior.

Yeah, Erlang is probably not a good choice. Not sure Node.js is either, but at least it's not PHP. I'd have probably gone with Java for the performance, relative deployment ease, and breadth of contribution you could expect from the community. I agree that you're likely to be I/O bound mostly, but you can get very good I/O performance from Java. Better than Node.js even, if you build it right. Go might also be viable on a performance basis if you could get a mature BTC client going for it (my Google biases may be showing here).

Having lived in Nairobi, smartphones are NOT the answer. Smartphone penetration is at around 300k-400k range in Kenya with the overwhelming bulk being in Nairobi. Even the smartphone users are highly sensitive to data usage charges. You cannot download the blockchain locally to these phones. It will simply cost too much.
Also the transaction type that Bitcoin would HAVE to solve first is urban-to-rural remittances. Your best bet is to treat Bitcoin as an incremental improvement on hawala transactions. You would need everything to run through a cloud-based wallet that can work with encrypted SMS / SIM Toolkit and/or USSD. That opens access to the Nokia 1280 style phones that everyone uses.
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:37:31
Really? I was told that the Safaricom M-PESA SIM toolkit app was sending an encrypted SMS via a tamper-resistant private key on the SIM and that it was not using USSD in the background. That said, I have very little faith in my sources, because few people in Kenya with real access to that information actually have a good idea how any of that really works.
@_date: 2013-08-16 07:09:31

@_date: 2013-12-20 16:19:04
And it's worth noting that a lot of people are probably going to end up using off-the-blockchain transactions in the future because the user experience is so much better for in-network transactions at places like Coinbase. Bought a digital album through them the other day from the record label that advertised their stuff in this subreddit a few days ago and it was the best transaction experience I'd ever had. Like 5 seconds to complete the whole thing, entirely mouse-driven, click, click, done, never touched my keyboard, and as far as I know, nothing ever hit the blockchain. And energy impact for that is totally negligible.
@_date: 2013-07-12 14:46:06
No one ever captures 100% of a market, much less overnight. Bitcoin might see 10% of that in an optimistic scenario. The reason it's worth getting excited about is that Kenya is not the only country with remittance behavior. 10% of all remittances is a hell of a lot more interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:40:38
That's actually kinda my point. There are a hell of a lot of banking data centers. Certainly more than 51. Though, to be fair, I thought ASIC efficiency would have a much larger effect than it actually did on the Bitcoin numbers.
Edit: Though I do tend to think the network is over provisioned relative to what's actually needed to process transactions. And I think that does need to be considered more publicly by the community as we transition over the next few years towards a network that enables significant levels of commerce.
@_date: 2013-08-16 07:17:25
Kipochi's been around only a few months. Even if you're incredibly optimistic, "massive adoption" isn't going to happen for several more years. M-PESA solved a largely unsolved problem. Bitcoin in Kenya solves the same and similar problems with fewer downsides. But there is always resistance to change, particularly if someone has a solution that seems "good enough".

There's a lot of payments experts in Kenya because of M-Pesa. Many of them will be familiar with Bitcoin. And many people over at the iHub will be familiar with it for a number of reasons, including that the iHub has a reasonably substantial GPU-based rig that's had a few cycles dedicated to mining (it's not meant to be a miner so much as a general purpose OpenCL setup). Ben Lyon over at Kopo Kopo and I had numerous conversations about Bitcoin and there's a few expats who've been working on projects at least tangentially related to Bitcoin.

Interesting. That potentially also lets you function as a way to do cross-network transfers. My best friend is a pilot in Uganda. They frequently have to pay for landing clearances in Kenya and elsewhere on extremely short notice. The current mechanism for doing this is often to enlist the services of someone in Uganda who is roaming with a Safaricom SIM. If you can make Bitcoin transfers internal to Kipochi instantaneous, you could definitely solve this very real use-case.

There are a few hard daily limits. IIRC, the most I can withdraw from an account in a day is 140,000 KSh, with a maximum balance of 100,000. So I'd need to transfer 70,000 in, send it out, then transfer another 70,000 in and send it out again to hit 140,000. That works out to roughly $1600 USD at the current exchange rate.

Believe me, I know this is not an accurate estimate and doesn't take every single factor into account. I'm just trying to establish a reasonable ballpark figure, because others are claiming crazy numbers like 81,570 tCO2 **per day**. If you think there's a better way to compute an accurate number, I'm all ears with upvotes at the ready. Also keep in mind that the US has seriously backed off coal usage in the last few years with the rise of cheap natural gas.
That said, sequestering this much CO2 would require 323,114 acres of forest to be planted at -1.22 tCO2 sequestered annually by your average acre of forest (according to EPA).

I worked at Google and worked closely with the team that built this when I was there. I won't go into too many details (NDAs, etc), but no, not even close. Very different payment models, very different implications. Beba is much more an evolution of the current payment world in a format designed to work in emerging markets. It requires partnerships, business deals, and regulatory approval to do anything. It's targeted at transit payments right now where immediate payment confirmation is required but the network is unreliable and possibly unreachable.

In the context of Kenya, transaction fees on competing local services are already rapidly headed towards zero. They're already far lower than credit cards in the US. In many cases they would be zero today if not for the fact that revenue share arrangements are the only thing that makes certain partnerships possible. The fees are rapidly moving to being hidden from consumers by moving the already low cost to merchants who are better able to absorb them whenever it's a "Buy Goods"/"Pay Bill" transaction rather than being P2P.
On top of that, minimum realistic Bitcoin transaction fee is around 0.0005 BTC. Assuming an average exchange rate of $100 USD (which we've been hovering around for awhile), that works out to $0.05, which is only half what M-PESA charges. If the price spikes because of demand, that fee becomes much higher. And keep in mind that M-PESA did not get to 31% of Kenya's GDP by moving 100 KSh at a time.
I lived in Kenya for almost two years. Very few people who actually use M-PESA have issues with the current [tariff schedules]( The only people for whom M-PESA's transaction fees would be too expensive are the ultra-poor who can't even afford a Nokia dumbphone. That demographic is going to be beyond Bitcoin's addressable market for the next twenty years and even if they were somehow able to use it, the net value to the Bitcoin economy would be similar to that of SatoshiDice.
Don't get me wrong, I'd already rather move funds internationally with Bitcoin than with Western Union. Those people are a disaster, but they are a disaster that exists because they are among the best equipped at navigating the incredibly challenging international financial regulatory environment and because most countries would rather make it difficult for money to leave their borders (for obvious not-cool reasons). Regulatory risk, opportunity costs, volatility, high exchange fees, technological complexity, and low accessibility all present massive additional hidden costs in the present day to the average Kenyan. Keep in mind that not all of the costs I'm referring to are monetary in nature, which does make them admittedly hard to evaluate objectively. But I know this firsthand, because I actually used Bitcoin from Kenya and ran into every single one of those issues. And I'm tech-savvy. The Kenyan mom in Kibera has little hope of navigating the world of Bitcoin without something like Kipochi dramatically simplifying the experience and eliminating most of the current hidden costs. And they can only do so by providing their service as a **loss leader**.
You can bet that Kenyans would abandon Bitcoin en masse if they get stuck without a local exchange and word of mouth goes out about things like frozen Mt. Gox accounts that can only be unfrozen with the assistance of a notary public. Which can only be found in a US Embassy and for which you need an appointment that can only be scheduled on a computer you don't have.

If you're using anything other than PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt to hash your passwords, you're doing it wrong. Also doing it client-side in JavaScript is generally considered an iffy practice. SSL. Accept no substitutes.
**Edit:** Looks like beat me to it.

This is about equivalent to 51 data centers. I actually don't have a problem with this level of usage.

Trivial to download and install in the background unless they're on dial up.
