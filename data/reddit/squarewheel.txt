If a single entity owned all of a currency, then the currency would immediately lose its value, no?

If you want your currency associated with illicit dealings, anyway.
Bittorrent is an incredible technology, yet it's often associated with piracy.  This has negative effects such as getting it blocked in the iPhone appstore, and just the negative connotation people associate with it.
Do you really want people to say "Bitcoin, isn't that what drug traffickers use"?
A much better focus would be on legitimate business, such as Reddit implementing it for Reddit Gold.

That all makes sense, thanks for the explanation.
Seems to be missing the Y scale for time, but guessing by how erratic it is I'd say it must be a pretty short time.

That's not what censorship is, cripes.

Ah, I'm Canadian so when I say "liberal" I just mean "leans left".

I'm all ears.  My view of politics is still very naive, and I want to hear from all sides.  I can certainly think of ex-CEOs of big businesses getting into political power, so I can absolutely see what you mean in that regard.  I still feel like Mom and Pop General stores need help to fight against the Walmart's out there, but I suppose that impedes on the idea of a free market.  It seems like the free market works a lot better in some industries than others.  Tech, for instance, is kind to the small guys.  A service like Twitter can beat out a giant like Google's "Buzz" by just being better.  The previous example of Mom and Pop's General store though, it seems to me, may need a helping hand.  People will always shop where the milk is 3 cents cheaper, and small businesses can't compete with that.  Again though, feel free to change my mind on this one.
I think your comment on diversity in political groups is very interesting.  Thinking of all the people I know, I can usually sort people into a list of "gun-toting extreme right", or "bleeding-heart liberal", though the majority simply fall into "apathetic".  Of those interested in politics though and not just a Fox News follower, it gets a little more interesting.  Thoughts on regulation, taxation, and spending can go in any direction.
Now frankly, I think the whole party system is silly.  I wish I could vote on individual issues as I don't agree with any party on everything.  I find the (Canadian) NDP aligns the most with my political views, but certainly not on every issue.
I'd be curious on hearing your political hypothesis when you finish formulating them.  Though keep in mind that I'm still largely a lay man.

I bet we can get even more specific: 20-something middle-class liberal white male programmers.

Yes, but there are thousands of times times more Paypal users than Bitcoin users.  There is security and convenience in that.

That was an incredibly informative post.  I've been apathetic about politics until quite recently, so I'm still learning a lot.  In today's politics it often feels like it comes down to the centralist vs extreme right-wing parties.
I've never understood the negative connotations associated with liberal, or even socialist for that matter - your explanation makes sense though.  I personally feel that often government regulation is necessary to stop monopolies, encourage smaller businesses, and make sure things are generally "fair".  As far as I can tell, liberals and conservatives agree on this except disagree on what constitutes "fair".  Specifically, when it comes to social services and taxing.
Libertarians seem to be more anti-government (no taxes or social services), and pro free-market.  Does that sound accurate?  I may be reading this all wrong.

Here's [one idea]( for the sidebar though.  Margins could be tweaked, but I think it'd make sense to group the square buttons.

This article doesn't even mention Bitcoin.  This is really not the appropriate subreddit.
@_date: 2013-05-10 14:25:54
I would call that "selling out".
edit: This was in response to your first message, not your edit.  In response to your new comment, yes all businesses are for profit, which is why businesses are commercial.  The word commercial comes from "commerce", buying and selling, *making money*.

Also, that's not even censorship.

Doesn't change the fact that it's a volatile currency and incredibly stupid to put your life savings into.

Because "go spam people" is a terrible idea.

When, not if.  Have you not watched the numbers?  This is still a volatile currency that has a tendency to lose all value over night.

That is simply not true.  Votes get more out of whack as they grow, but it still does happen at smaller numbers.

Did you delete your comment for being downvoted, then repost the same thing...?

By becoming commercialized...?

When you look at the number of justifications people are making in this subreddit it makes for a valid point.  It's really easy to let cognitive dissonance affect your rationalization.

Are you seriously suggesting I'm bulk-downvoting you?  Because I haven't downvoted you even once.  I respect the reddiquette, thanks.

Vote manipulation is one of the only actual rules of Reddit.

Why are you investing in a volatile currency if you have the option to pay off your debts...?

I agree, now is the time.  I've seen this currency crash before, and it's overnight.
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:36:58
Immediately discounting somebody's views because they hold an opinion you disagree with is some pretty heavy confirmation bias.
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:39:57
It certainly wouldn't be the first time.  The currency is still volatile at this point.
