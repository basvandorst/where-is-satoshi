Yep, I know; Schiff explained that time and time again while presenting his position about bitcoin. When he was referring to the intrinsic value of gold he was talking about the non-monetary uses of gold, and to the fact that human beings historically perceived gold as a precious and naturally desired thing.

I'm not an economist but, from what I understand, the subjective theory of value refers to goods not to currencies. Schiff's point is that when it comes to currencies, having an intrinsic value is one of the key features to make it widely accepted. I don't see any contradiction.

I agree, I think it's just a problem of language, the term "intrinsic" is tricky to define. ;)
I wasn't thinking in that definition of intrinsic "the value of a thing absent its monetary value" and I think neither Schiff used the term to refer to that. On the contrary, Schiff always said is that historically, gold / silver proven to have some property (don't know exactly what) that humans tend to value a lot (they simly like it for it's shiny?), in that sense it has a baseline exchange value (someone will always want to buy it, aka it will never plunge to near-zero value). That, is what he ment and I was referring to. ;)
He argues that bitcoin is lacking a property like that, essential in his view for a currency, to stand the test of time.

ah ok, you ment "won't make back it's current value in BTC". In that case, I am very well aware of that. ;)

I never heard Schiff saying that the value of a currency is intrinsic.
What he ment is that for the particular case of a currency (instead of all the other goods), in addition to the value that comes from "how much people are willing to use it as a currency", it also greatly benefits from having alternative uses or some intrinsic value people appoint to it for some reason (shiny things?) to properly last the test of time.
Again, not an expert here, but I don't see how this contradicts the subjective theory of value.

Much thanks for your reply!
For now I don't plan to make any money out of it, it's more of an experiment, that's why I'm just willing to invest a trivial amount of money in it for a cheap usb device.
That said, those things consume a tiny amount of wattage and I can just let them go 24/7 on a low-powered pc that already stays up 24/7 anyway, why wouldn't I make my money back sooner or later? can u explain? Thanks in advance! ;)

Thanks for your reply. USB asicminers are one of those products I originally found to be similar to what I was looking for. 
My point is, I would like an "expert" view on the thing, like a short coparison of current and near-future devices. I mean, I'd hate to buy a ~300MH/s USB miner for 50 bucks and then, after two weeks, discover that a new cheap USB device has come out and does 750 MH/s for the same wattage and price. =)

Read some political philosophy, basic economics, and possibly history from a macroscopic perspective. You will enjoy it a lot, feel enriched, understand a lot about the world, and write less nonsense. ;)

Thanks for your reply. I already have plans to try and mine some altcoin with my current PC hardware. I'll edit the original post with this info to avoid further duplicate posts ;)
