They need to know what you have in order to tax it, Bitcoin wallets can use different addresses for each transaction.

Because the corrupt, unconstitutional, private Federal Reserve wanted to be to sole issuer of Fiat Currency to increase their wealth and power, income tax is one of their ways of achieving that goal.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:06:48
There's no law compelling you to pay tax.

Merry Christmas, thanks for sharing your story.
Whenever I have a major crisis like this happen to me it has always turned around for the better and whenever I look back I see things weren't as bad as I thought they were.
You'll pull through, just don't let this put you off investing money into cryptocurrency, get back on your feet, dust yourself off and let this be a lesson that improves your life from now on.
Everything will be all right.

There's no law that says you have to pay income tax.

Welcome to Bitcoin, you must be new here!
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:12:03
Not necessary.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:35:21
Because Bitcoin is being sabotaged.

It's bCash not Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:03:50
If it wasn't for people using Bitcoin we'd not be at 10k, but still sucks to think how much he could be sitting on.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:50:06
Green Address, they charge you for instant transactions.

I have Bitcoin Cash but I can't access it because it was stored in the GreenAddress wallet, which is a a multi-signature wallet. I'd be so happy if I could also get some help, been trying for weeks to figure it out all by myself. You'll also see I've tried asking the GreenAddress Reddit page for help with no success.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:39:19
If you do decide to help me and you succeed, I'll give you some of the spoils.
