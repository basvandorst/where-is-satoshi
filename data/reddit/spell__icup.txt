The adult thing to do is to mention that this happened when you were a college student and did what most college student would do. Then maybe talk about how thankfully your decision making abilities have evolved since then. 
I get that the advice could have been less harsh but you also could have responded differently.

Was curious about that  as well so I looked it up and found out Spotify used p2p on desktops prior to having enough servers to achieve their desired latency.

Good thing for those with coins in their Coinbase accounts (myself included) but should we really be celebrating this with all the negative sentiments people have about the gox?

Looks like Coinbase is now using the Mt. Gox exchange price

They actually just switched to using Mt. Gox prices

My guess is either they lost more than they expected due to arbitrage or the change was accidental.

He said the opposite. They want to limit payment options for the developer units to ensure those who will actually make content for it can get their hands on one. Bitcoin will add to the payment options which he says he welcomes for the final consumer version

Apparently Coinbase didn't like the arbitrage that instantly occurred and changed things back rather quickly. But I understand what you mean now, such a move would benefit those trying to convert from bitcoin/merchants who were potentially losing money by using coinbase.
