Digital Gold:Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money by Nathaniel Popper. I like it because it explains what was before satoshi come up with bitcoin.

How much did you payed on transaction fee? If it was around 5 to 10 sat/byte, you should expect 20 or more hours to confirm (might be out of date).

Eventually you will have to connect in order to spend your funds. I think it is not the safest way to store bitcoin since your computer was exposed while your node was updating. EDIT: More opinion and spelling.

Hey, I just looked it up and Mercado Bitcoin have a way of controling the fee you pay. Just click on "advance settings" and then choose "set fee manually". Then you can choose a fee based on this site [bitcoinfees]( The averange transaction is 226 bytes in size. 226 bytes times 10 satoshi per byte gives you roughly 0.00003 sat, wich is about 0.7 BRL and 15 hours to confirm.

Search for "bitcoin scalability problem" on Google and you will find a whole Wikipedia page about it.
Also search for "bitcoin transaction fee" and click on the very first link and read the table. You can send any value for anyone for 10 satoshi if you want. Every decent wallet will let you set how much you want to pay.
EDIT: I changed fee value to me more realistic.

Hello fellow BR. I started in the very same way. If you want to HODL, it is best to transfer to a cold storage to ensure your ownership over your coins. I don't know how to avoid the MercadoBitcoin's fee though :/

Moments before you confirm your transaction, go to the settings of your wallet and change the fee to 0. That simple.

Sorry. My bad. Pay 10 satoshi for 20h to confirm.

The high fee problem is close to a myth since you can pay 0 to 10 satoshi for an averange of 120 blocks to confirm the transaction. This means that if you make a simple transaction (226 bytes is the averange), you will pay only 0.3 USD. It is true that the confirmation will take 15 to 20 hours to confirm, but as a business owner, I think that it is better than wait 30 days to withdraw my money from the credit card payment company.
