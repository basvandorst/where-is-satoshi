As I see it, one would have to make a trade-off between verifiability and deniability for the voter.
It seems hard (if not impossible) to both provide proof to the voter that his vote was registered correctly while at the same time providing no possible proof to the coercer.
Please correct me if I'm wrong here

What you are suggesting is certainly close to what I have in mind.
Colored Coins allows an organization to issue specific coins with an intrisic value (i.e. one vote), and ZeroCoin promises anonymity in voting.
What is also needed is a way to audit the system to ensure that the results are correct - both by individuals to ensure that their vote is recorded and counts in the final result, and also the entire system to check that the entire result is correct and has not been tampered with.
However, the individual auditing somewhat clashes with elections having to be receipt-free (google 'receipt free secret ballot elections'), as in it shouldn't be possible for a third party to coerce the voter to show what they voted for, because then a voter could be threatened to vote a specific way and the malicious person could require to see this receipt.
Thanks for the very interesting notes :-)

Wow, these look very interesting. I will look into them tomorrow :-)
Thanks a lot
