Sorry, I'm a nocoiner and I still don't know.
Is there any use-value for a Bitcoin at all?
I think there is not, unless you consider the numismatic value.

In either case, lack of people mining is not the reason for the high fees. As far as everybody wants to be on the main chain, fees will be high. The small block size may have something to do with that.

Yes, it is funny, and yes, it would make sense, but only in an abstract sense, not for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin security is based on [Proof-of-Work]( That's what makes mining to be concentrated in a few hands, mostly in China.
What you propose is something like [Proof-of-stake](  which is the mechanism used by some cryptocurrencies, but not by Bitcoin.

To do that, people would have to download the entire blockchain, which is already around 150GB big. Not everybody is willing to do that. As I said, I don't think that's realistic with Bitcoin.


Sure, you can try any of the multiple altcoins out there. Each one tries to solve these kind of problems in a different way.

You mean, other than they *will issue letter grades on Cryptocurrencies*?
This is from their [FAQ](
(Speaking about investors) *They want to know which cryptocurrencies can provide the richest rewards with the lowest risk and the most sustainable technology. Plus, they need the guidance to help avoid cryptocurrencies that are the most vulnerable to devastating crashes.*
Sure, as if [ratings]( were useful at all...

Why would the miners do it for free? They are not Samaritans. For them, this is a business like any other. They don't buy expensive and specialized ASIC hardware to build a better world, fight the FED or help you to pay a coffee, they do it for the money.
You are still swapping cause and consequence. Try applying what you said to gold mining and maybe you will see it does not make much sense:
*Gold cost money because the gold miners are getting paid.*
*If the miners did it for free, we would have free gold.*
Does this real life example help?

LOL. How in earth will it become the world currency if it keeps rising all the time? A currency which is always increasing in value will never be spent as a currency (as everybody will prefer to pay with dollars), and something which nobody spends will hardly become the world currency.
You do not realize about this contradiction?

*The only reason transactions fees are so high is because people are mining for profit.*
It's actually the other way around: People are mining for profit because it is profitable, thanks to block rewards and fees.
You may have different reasons to buy or use Bitcoin (pseudo-anonymity, distrust to banks or the Federal Reserve, etc) but at least we can be pretty sure that miners do it for the money.

Again, why would people be constantly mining, considering that ASIC hardware is [a lot more efficient than ASIC or GPU mining](
You would most probably not find any block at all, and everything you would get is an increased electricity bill.
Maybe you think that the "total work to be done" per transaction is constant or something, but that's not the case: There is a parameter called *difficulty* which adjust itself automatically so that a new block is produced every ten minutes on average.
As a result, hardware mining is always in the verge of profitability, while people mining with CPUs or GPUs would spend more electricity for nothing.

From the abstract:


Do you really want ordinary people to accept bitcoin by
proselytizing the opposing opinion and being immune to influence?

Ignore for a while all the "argumentum ad consequentiam" that you will read in this thread.
There is a precise protocol to generate new blocks and therefore new coins. If you don't follow the protocol, the other nodes will not recognize the new coins you want to create.
OTOH, if you are thinking about all nodes at once doing this, some sort of "conspiration against the wealthy BTC users", then yes, search for "Bitcoin 51% attack" and you will find the way to do that.

Instead of "inherent value" people should probably speak about use-value and exchange-value.
You can make things with gold, such as jewelry or electronics, so it's said to have use-value.
This is different than exchange-value, which is about what people is willing to pay for it.
Ludwig von Mises says things start to be used as money when they have use-value to begin with. Otherwise, how could you convince someone to accept it as payment if it could not be used for anything?
The problem with Bitcoin is that it changed from not having exchange-value to having exchange-value, but without having use-value at all as a first step.
Economists see this fact as "fishy" and consider this is like cheating, or creating money from nothing.
Try explaining what's the use-value of Bitcoin **before** it started to be used to pay for things, and it will start to look less fishy to economists.

I stand corrected on that, then, but I'm not sure what you want.


So you want everybody to mine with inefficient CPUs just for you to have lower fees? I wish you luck.

The FED could still lend those banks some extra money (in the form of dollar bills) so that they have cash for everybody.
On the other hand, what would happen if 10% of bitcoin users went to the exchanges at once to convert their BTC into dollars?
How much the price of Bitcoin would plummet?
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:35:54
Because supply is fixed and the only way to absorb demand shocks is by rising prices.

No matter where you put the decimal point, 0.00117647
is as "ugly" as 1.17647 or 11.7647 or 117.647, not because the place you put the point, but because the total number of digits involved.
As far as internet merchants set their prices in dollars and only convert them to BTC for the purposes of payment, this will be an unsolved problem.

From the video:
*Bitcoin's price fluctuates. The price will stabilize as it is used more as a currency.*
I'm curious: Do Bitcoin users really believe that? I ask because volatility does not seem to have improved a bit in all the years Bitcoin has existed.
