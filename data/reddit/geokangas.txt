P2Pool is great and all… but for what minimum hash rate? A terahash or so?  Please (anybody) reply with a suggested minimum hash rate, so that P2Pool payouts won't be more than a month or two apart.  Thanks.
For all the rest, they could improve the situation by switching to another normal pool, but small (e.g., Slush, BitMinter, BitParking…).

A guy on bitcoin talk proposed a really simple solution (sorry, I don't have a link), but nobody there was inclined to discuss it.  Here's how it works:
Let's say an honest miner publishes his block, then immediately a selfish miner publishes his pre-mined block very aggressively (by sending it to 20 gajillion nodes).  Without a way for other miners to distinguish the honest block from the selfish block, the selfish one will usually win by superior publishing power (i.e., more bandwidth, and more connections to other nodes).
But there's a very easy way to to see that one of the two competing nodes is the honest one: the time field of the block header.  In the honest block, the time field will be pretty close to the real time on the other miners' system clocks at the time they receive it.  The selfish miner can't be that accurate, because when he premined his block he didn't know exactly when he would publish it.
So, whenever two valid blocks are in contention, just prefer the one with the more accurate time field.  Then the selfish block will be the orphaned block, most of the time.
Why would this simple policy not utterly foil the selfish miner?

I read Zirgs' comment as ironic, implicitly attributing those views to the bitcoin-clueless trustee.

Wait… wouldn't selfish mining cause *more* variance in the timestamp?  When the selfish miner "pre-mines" that block, he doesn't yet know when he'll publish it.  So the timestamp field can only be a guess.

  How about more than 32 bits in the nonce field of the block header?
  Wouldn't it be nice to calculate the Merkle root *just once*, and then be able to find a nonce to make the header's hash get under the target?
  If Satoshi is reading this: why, *why* just 32 bits?  If difficulty == 1, then 32 bits is *barely* enough.

  Each miner may choose which TX's to include, and in which order.  Also, each miner includes his own *generation transaction* as the first TX.
  The generation transaction is the one which sends the 25 BTC reward, plus all of the TX fees from the other TX's, to an address provided by that miner.  The generation TX also includes some random bits, called extranonce (because Satoshi didn't put enough bits in the nonce field of the block header).
  So, there's virtually no chance that two miners will be solving the same hashing problem.

The arrival of blocks is a Poisson process (approximately), so the time t between adjacent blocks is distributed approximately like:
    P * t * (e ^ (Lt))
With constants P and L adjusted so that the total probability (over 0 &lt; t &lt; infinity) is one, and the average time is whatever number of minutes.
