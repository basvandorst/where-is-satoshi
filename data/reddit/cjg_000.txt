10 year government bonds averaged a yield of 5% from 1928-2014 [source]( He would have $209k today. More than enough to beat inflation (though he wouldn't have been guaranteed to beat inflation. 
If he wanted to be super low risk, he could have invested in 3 month T-Bills and been at $59k today and still beaten out inflation. 
I don't know how accessible directly investing directly in government issued securities was in 1928.

IANAL: My understanding is that it's guidance on interpretation of the law. I don't know how legally strong it is but it might be possible you could take it to court with your own interpretation of the law.

At least not in the hands of strangers that don't have much trust built up and offer almost no protection for it. I keep my money in a bank because of the protections it offers.

Since most places that accept bitcoin peg prices to traditional currencies, the price of things in bitcoin tends to be much more volatile than the price of things in dollars. 
While the value of a bitcoin measured in bitcoins may be constant but the value of a bitcoin measured by what goods it can buy is still very volatile.

Gold and precious metals seem acceptable there even if they aren't popular though. I'm not a fan of holding significant amounts of a non-producing asset like gold or BTC but it does seem contradictory to consider one and criticize anyone considering the other.

It will depend on the supply/demand of each fork. It likely won't be that each fork is valued evenly. If people mostly buy one fork it might end up with 80% of the value leaving the others with 15% and 5% each.
