Investing in BTC now is a binary investment. You're either going to win big or lose it all. 
The advice to "buy low and sell high" is so pointless. If we could all do this no one would make any money. We need the ninnies that sell high and buy low. That's how the market works. I've made a point to buy at all the ATHs.
Invest only what you can lose. Don't bitch if you lose your house or retirement. That should be the only advice worth giving.

I'm so pissed that I had to have that conversation with them. This post is getting down voted so it won't see the life of day, but banks look at us as a commodity. They are doing US a favor by letting us give them our money. Even though they use that money to invest into funds which earn them crap loads of interest.

Yeh, and when the same crap happens at the next bank? and the next bank? and the next bank? And yes, they rely upon that fact that changing banks, especially when you have an entire infrastructure setup, isn't something that you can do every six months.

The problem with Reddit - is this needed to be top of the list 7 hours ago when I was wanting to join the conversation. The upvote thing takes a long time. The price was plummeting FROM 20, causing the crash. ie, Coinbase pulled the plug.
I wonder how much of that Nicehash BTC was sold off today, which drove the price up.

That is so bizarre. I mine crypto as apart of my business. It's a corp and I have a full business account at BofA. So BofA isn't going to let me cash it out now? What the hell do they care?

Can you explain more about this? I have a business account with BofA. It's registered in my corporation (s-corp). Mining is a side part of my business, and eventually I'd like to cash out profits. Am I in money services? Why is mining coins money services?

Um. It's been going down and up all the way from 4,900. I would say the trend is down. But I guess what you're saying is the floor was $3,750? I think we'll def see lower than that.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:37:27
I think we'll have another shot to buy under 3k. This is a false rise that is going to catch a lot of people off guard trying to buy back in.
Or I'm wrong. Either way. I'm not selling till 2050! 
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:19:30
I agree, but the market is overextended and if people start looking at gold and T.Bills to hedge, it could mean a correction in the DOW. My buddy just last night moved his full 401k into a Treasury fund. Not sure that was the smartest choice, but one small domino. If BTC can be proven in a time of turmoil to hold value as gold has in the past, we could see a very large influx of money. The BTC=Gold thing has been beaten to death since 2012, but it's also never really been tested....

Ok but your post says "we hit bottom".... and we haven't.

Well it did drop below $3k so I'm going to say I was right :P

@_date: 2017-09-13 18:19:25
Yup totally agree. BTC is unlike any other investment. I bought at the peak in 2013 and then all the way through the rebound and even at 4800! This is a longggg term strategy of either total success or total failure (obviously I'm banking on the success).
We're not going to see the total collapse like we we did in 2013, it's going to be gradual with a mix of small cliffs. Especially due to those who are trading something as you say "have no idea what they bought". There was a post on here about someone who bought BTC for their mom, and they are panicking about the drop....
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:09:34
No way. It's going to fall to low 2's over the next few weeks then stay there for a year at least

I agree. $2800 might still end up on the negative side, but that's a solid position to take.

Yeh I'm feeling very confused too. Trying to read all these posts and not sure what to make of it?
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:37:38
If I had an electrum wallet pre-August 1. Then post august 1 transfered it all to a new electrum wallet. And now I also have coins in Coinbase. Can I move the CB coins to my post-august electrum wallet before November. Or should I created a third electrum wallet for the CB coins? So I'd have Electrum 1 (0 btc, but keys that I can get BCH with), Electrum 2 (post August wallet with btc), and Electrum 3 (new CB coins). Or can 2 and 3 be combined?

Nope. $1300 more to go..
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:49:12
It'll go back to $1000. No one is buying, even coinbase has the "we are experiencing a delay in btc sell orders" message up.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:47:40
How is that trolling? I honestly see all these people using HODL and think, that there is a 20 something who has no trading experience, and is locked into trades they can't get out of because they have no free capital. It makes no sense to hold in this market. Sell, buy sell buy sell buy. That's how you get your lambo and moons and all those things.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:25:39
Yes yes, that is true. But like every market someone always has to take the fall. I meant more, the overwhelming sway right now are sellers cashing out. The $2000 mark is a magic number, if it can push through that to 1900 avg, we might see more drop, kind of like what is happening with ETH.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:22:58
Ah that was BTU... Ugh I'm getting turned around.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:55:00
Same mentality though. It's a market system.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:24:44
I've been more focused on the ether side and have probably blocked out most of the HODL posts as i assume they are filled with bad information. 
And yes I think BTC will keep falling, I love crypto, but we are in a bubble. I also mine (not BTC), so I do have a vested interest in keeping that bubble, but I'm also realistic.
Perhaps my title should have said "anyone who uses the term HODL, so be ignored 'cause they probably have nothing of value to offer".
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:45:44
That is some magic right there.

@_date: 2017-07-26 12:07:44
So I have all my btc in two addresses in my electrum wallet. They are basically saying after aug 1. Make a new electrum wallet. Transfer btc from my two address to a new address in my new electrum wallet. And then when that is confirmed import the two old keys into a BCC wallet?
This basically applies to everyone who controls their private keys right? Even a simple paper wallet can be sent to a new a paper wallet and then the old wallet imported to a bcc wallet?
That seems too easy. Are the bcc sitting in the old keys susceptible to anything? Or is it just that the price of bcc might crash fast given everyone off loading it?

I love the tech. I'm a developer and have been getting into Ether contracts, and just went to two developer packed meetups in San Fran. I'm just talking about the term HODL here and that it's annoying and what it represents.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:07:42
$1000 should be your target. Coinbase even has the network delay message up from all the sells. It's got a long way to fall before it bottoms. If you have the cash to buy all the way down, there's not reason not too. It'll be back up next year, but if you really want to make a good return, buy around $1200.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:26:07

@_date: 2017-07-16 18:01:31
Right, so it's based on total fluff.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:23:48
But since we're in Electrum, we can just export Private Keys and import them into a BCC wallet. So, what will be the safe BCC wallet and not some phishing app?
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:44:59
Coinbase requires asking you are moving your BTC to another exchange, is moving to wallet like electrum now a taxable event?

But wait, didn't Electrum write two articles on how to get split your coins between BTC and BCC? So confused, I chose Electrum for this very reason.

I did Coinbase and I did the instant verify (it's scary giving all your bank info over, but it worked out just fine). I changed all my passwords and security questions after it was verified. 
It takes three business days for the funds to transfer and to get your coin, but you are locked in at the price you bought at. And right now, BTC is down a lot following China's news, so a good time to get in.
You can xfer it away from Coinbase once you have the coin in your Coinbase wallet. 
Also, you can setup instant buy by connecting your credit card.. dangerous :)

I know the prices are a bit high, but these really don't exist anywhere else. They'll goto eBay if no interest, but thought the early adopters of Bitcoin might want to help a new Bitcoin lover get a head start in the game!
