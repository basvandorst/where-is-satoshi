He's not really saying much at all though. All these things happened to bitcoin because it is the most popular coin, which is mostly because it was the first coin. The only thing that this tweet *really* says is that we know more about how bitcoin behaves in practice because it has been used more. I mean, he even talks about hash rate when there are already alts that have no real concept of mining, because mining its self is a problem.

The bitcoin rollback actually seems like an example of the blockchain doing what it was designed to be able to do. The transactions in question still exist, they're just ignored by everyone because they're not on the longest chain anymore.
But any alt still using a proof-of-work based chain could do the same, so this doesn't have anything to do with bitcoin in particular if you ask me.

If you don't know what a thing is, look it up on wikipedia and then boom you know how bitcoin works.

There's been so little talk about this that, until yesterday, I didn't realize a segwit address was even a thing.

What would you suggest then? There's not really a layer on top of open-source scripts that makes it easier for clueless people to verify them other than having other people do it for them.

Moore's law slowing down is such a given these days that it's used simply for context in interview questions.
And this article is basically about how it's hard for a single metric to exist that measure's moore's law these days because the ways we improve chips is not the way we used to: 
EUV will be a major step forward, but you have to be very optimistic to assume that we'll pull something like that off again. EUV has been in development since the late 90s iirc, and it's still not ready, and up until a few years ago we still weren't sure if it could be pulled off at all.

The change in that regard is pretty small too. Single threaded performance for processors has been stagnating, and exponential growth is no longer a reasonable assumption for the future. Sandy bridge is intel's core design from 2005. Skylake is from 2016. In 11 years, single-threaded performance in general went up ~25%
To address exactly what you've said, though: FLOP performance has not changed drastically either. [This document details timings on specific instructions for all AMD and Intel core designs and refreshes.]( FLOP arithematic hasn't changed much at all, but reciprocal throughput for FDIV has doubled from sandy bridge to skylake. If you look at FSIN and similar instructions, you'll notice that throughput has actually lowered and time to finish has done a mix of improvements and regression.
Exponential growth in performance is a thing of the past. We now have something much closer logarithmic growth with time. The fact of the matter is, if you buy a new processor from AMD or Intel this year, you're probably set for a decade.
As for internet bandwidth, I've had the same internet speed for the past 7 years.
