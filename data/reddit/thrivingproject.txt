I just purchase 200 gh/s at HashFlare.io. Cost roughly $5 usd. I'm going to give it a few days and then update whether or not BTC deposits are going into my wallet or not.

I found a few reviews verifying Coinomia to be a scam. However, I have found a site that seems to be very legitimate. Essentially you pay a one time fee which helps to cover costs of operating mining hardware, and in return you get a share of the bitcoin that is mined. Three websites here verify the legitimacy of the operation:
The website is genesis-mining.com. I plan to sign up in the near future. Will update on if it works.

So far the best ways I have found in the United States are Coinbase.com and Circle.com. The both sell for slightly hire than market rates - Coinbase.com charges 1.49% fee on a linked bank account and arrives 4-5 days after purchasing (you still get the rate bitcoin was at on the original purchase date) and circle.com has no fees if you use debit/credit card.

Grats! I also see great potential and am excited about the future.
