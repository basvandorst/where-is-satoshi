I'd give him some satoshis lol
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:48:04
Now.  Tippin.me
@_date: 2019-03-05 23:18:23
How is it better than the Model T?
@_date: 2019-02-14 21:15:32
Just looking for where to post it...two for twenty has to be a winner!
@_date: 2019-02-06 22:55:04
Was hoping Marty would land him, but this is awesome too
@_date: 2019-02-20 19:36:05
That's a huge benchmark.  Cherish the moment!
@_date: 2019-02-05 23:45:45
Yep, privacy is the final notch for me.  We effectively have it, but it's labor intensive (wasabi wallet).
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:26:49
I love cash app, but wish I could send from Cash App to my Wasabi Wallet :(
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:45:50
Those that click it will watch 2 minutes before peacing out.
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:32:01
I bought bitcoin at 9k!  I bought it at lots of other prices too.
@_date: 2019-02-05 23:34:19
All of them.
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:34:22
I wish I could sell a kidney for like, 10 bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:35:40
lol show me where!
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:22:41
I need it to wait just 2 more days, JUST 2 DAYS BITCOIN PLEASEEEEEEEEE
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:27:30
This has me wondering if it may be a good idea to consolidate my UTXOs now.  Will it hurt me for the times that I had .002 satoshis in one utxo and .00035 in another?
@_date: 2019-04-12 22:27:20
well done
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:48:56
&lt;3 u grandpa
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:37:57
so if i have, say....30 transactions on a ledger, would i just pull up a new ledger address and send all the coins to that one place?
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:13:42
I sent all my bitcoin to his trading bot and expect to be very wealthy soon.  Right?  RIGHT?
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:17:18
hornier than a unicorn on a cold morning!
@_date: 2019-04-09 20:20:31
Hey look, it's bait!
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:17:34
Care to give a reading list for us unwashed masses?  I'd like to educate myself a bit more.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:12:22
I have read that one.  I took a week long shower afterwards.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:57:59
That 15 year old Ledger Wizard will open shop to help these folks out
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:56:38
i'm buying tonight. can't wait!
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:44:20
and when is it hitting 1M?
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:14:54
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:58:35
My address is segwit and I would tattoo your name to my body for 1 bitcoin.  :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:53:56
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:33:22
Your 3 year old has a lot more BTC than me.  Feelsbadman.
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:29:18
If we had to trade in the idea of flying cars to avoid world communism then I'm happy with the deal.  But I still want flying cars.... :(
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:17:18
I really do hope that trash dies...kinda makes me sick that one of the few coins on Coinbase is freaking Bcash.  Not good.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:24:08
THATS IT!
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:56:46
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:22:48
I wonder the same.  I'm not feeling good about some of my recent purchases, but they're most certainly mine now.
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:49:58
Please, please don't think it's wise to buy an investment on credit.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:25:42
You'll get your wish
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:50:59
Then how do you know it is still on track?
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:57:47
From everything I've read, that's where the Stellar team has been working on implementation. Would definitely be interesting to watch how it unfolds.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:20:23
I've spent all day trying to think of a cool bitcoin/crypto website project I could work on for the rest of the year, but have had absolutely no worthy ideas.  My entire mind is a bear market.  
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:46:00
And now you need to scrub and delete this account.
@_date: 2019-01-24 19:10:24
Smart man.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:24:00
Why not both?
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:33:19
What can you do to change that??
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:15:08
On its way down, or up?
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:45:37
I think ultimately you're right.  I just want to get a place where I'm secure enough in my life to be able to live that same way.  Congratulations on being there man, it's really good.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:48:59
Damn dude, that is worthy of celebration!  Congrats man.  Hope to some day be able to say the same.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:39:20
Enjoy it, we're getting ready to continue our plunge :(
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:28:29
You know the answer to each one of these questions, yet you ask anyways.  Curious.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:23:33
Too far man.  That's too far.
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:11:57
Hard pass!
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:42:35
I'll give you my shoulder for just .1 BTC.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:22:37
I agree, but I do often have doubts whether it will be Bitcoin or another crypto.  I hope it's Bitcoin (not because I have much...I'm just a fanboy at this point).
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:57:31
I bought a bit too high (8900, 8700, and 8500).  Just waiting to get some more fiat then will come in hopefully around current prices.  Wish I had more money!
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:54:34
Good morning Ian!
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:13:18
hey hey, i'm a hodler too!  I just have a much smaller stack than I want.  My goal was 1 bitcoin by end of year, but that's not looking possible any longer.  Who knows, maybe I can do something to make that a possibility.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:01:22
I hope you're right on Bcash.  Lot of interesting data to watch as it withers out (if it happens that way).
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:10:42
1.4!!  Nice man, that's going to do quite well for you.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:19:12
I hope like hell we do.  I still got a ways to go to start feeling clever again.
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:28:31
Good lord.  He flew too close to the sun.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:11:03
There were plenty of people that felt as you do now, and did what you would have done then.  My grandpa used to bury all kinds of shit in his yard.
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:45:28
Who do you work for?
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:22:54
Oh I know.  I was joking about myself having enough money to do that.  Maybe my phrasing was poor.
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:58:04
I think your sarcasm meter might need adjustment.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:12:24
If it was his girlfriend to him, what fee would paypal charge?  F&amp;F has no fees and is instant.  I am all for crypto, and would prefer it to paypal for a number of reasons...but lets not set down the truth for the sake of an easier argument.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:12:35
How the hell would we jump to 8.5?!  Not doubting you but I don't understand how it could change so fast.
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:26:53
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:58:28
I entirely agree.  I have been saying for a while that BTC under 10k is a ridiculous value.  
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:05:19


Soon.  Oh, BTC below 7k?  Later.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:01:41
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:40:13
Hate this guy.  He has no evidence of being wrong with money, though.  Would love to know what's in his portfolio. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:59:53
This reply is fantastic.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:24:49
Am doin!
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:38:47
Damn dude, atta boy!  I dream of having a whole coin (literally).  Enjoy dat spread sheet glowing gloriously on your desk!
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:46:08
Wait, I talked to a guy like 2 days ago that said this exact same thing.  Like word for word.  You've got a financial twin out there somewhere!  
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:28:27
Piss off fat fingers bot!  They can pinch and zoom if they care.  
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:02:05
damn dude, wish i could say the same.  You should do it!  
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:01:54
Nope.  If you're looking for the best monetary system for flea markets in Maine I'd suggest you still carry cash at the time.  If the Maine flea market's expansion continues as I predict this very well could be the Achilles heal for BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:06:46
ha, probably should have!  Property is long sold now.  He said he got everything of value out, but who knows?  
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:22:55
I think I'll stick with coinbase
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:04:00
Do it.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:02:48
Par for the course!
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:03:01
man i shot my wad on the "bottom" so many times it aint funny.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:11:09
Invest accordingly.  
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:50:43
Yes, but as time goes on it's harder and harder for me to acquire bitcoin!  
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:32:00
I get the multiple accounts thing, but why hit each daily thread with the same comments?  What purpose does that serve?
@_date: 2018-04-22 04:38:23
I own less than you
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:44:54
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:07:01
Money is a tremendous part of the powers over 'everything else'.  Not entirely, but it is a big part of it.  Bitcoin + 2A is a powerful recipe for liberty.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:08:50
Mark who?  I just buy on Coinbase as budget allows.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:49:44
Oh interesting.  I meant more towards which crypto's he will be buying, but good to know.  Facebook sells don't shock me, but the Google sells make me wonder what's around the corner.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:14:35
It's got nearly 11 billion dollars in it as of right now. You can claim it's on its way to dying, but no way you can declare it dead.
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:37:31
I have no doubt you'll break even (and gain).  But at that buy in I'd say just get out of the daily threads and get a little side hobby.  If you check it daily and wait for it you're going to tear yourself up.  Be patient and you'll do fine.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:37:10
Being able to do small scale transactions makes such an important difference.  Cannot wait for this to be the norm!  Admittedly, I HODL...but if I could start keeping around $100 "cash" on a mobile lightning wallet I'd love to use that in my day-to-day.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:12:18
Feels like it!  I wasn't expecting this much today.  
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:08:38
If that happened today I'd keep a close eye on what happens to the price of Monero.
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:14:08
Not crediting the article?  Bad form.
^^^^was ^^^^a ^^^^snappy ^^^^ass ^^^^sentence ^^^^tho
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:30:08
The 10M at the top of that chart...  Could you even imagine?
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:45:52
Buy heavy at a lower amount to help your dollar cost average.
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:42:02
Why would the scale make an impact?
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:47:16
Dang man, just openly slamming a country?  Is that an acceptable thing to do socially now?  Because if so I've missed a ton of great LULZ in reading about the world.
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:25:20
I'm so happy to see the numbers rising, but if we go back into bull mode I wouldn't be too upset at having another sale on crypto.  Hell I'm supposed to get a bonus soon, let it drop for a small stretch!
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:02:19
Nobody seems to be talking about it because nobody is actually using it.
