**Fifty** BTC forks this year?
WTF - you just trying to Destroy yourselves?
Forkgen. "This is a Bitcoin fork coin generator. Use at your own risk."
**"Q: How should exchanges decide to list one fork but not another?**
A: Exchanges should be obligated to split and distribute all arbitrary fork coins despite the systems expense and security risk. Who are they to decide what makes one fork more legitimate than any other?"

Not sure if this is what you mean, but the "confirmation bias" among ETH holders / supporters on their sub after it passed 1000 the other day was astounding.I was amazed to see it from people who have 2,3 and more years invested the coin and protocol.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:19:03
Yea, saw that. And they are gonna market to HFTers and try Arbitrage - good luck.

Yep, a lot like .com in 2000. But there are a bunch of companies / startups incorporating blockchain for useful purposes that will benefit them, their customers and investors/shareholders. BC has big advantages over the status quo in inventory management, safety, data reliability, transaction speeds, contract verification and on... By 2002 the web was ascendant again. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:03:23
I don't either - it was just an historical example. I think we'll see BC adoption/incorporation by Q2 2018 - tho it might fly under MSM reporting. There does seem to be a coordinated FUD campaign by MSM to slam cryptos; just not sure if the intent is to kill it or drive it down so *entities* can buy in cheaply.

Does any one use CEX.io? They seem to get mixed reviews on Reddit and elsewhere &gt;  They've been around forever and UK based, but my main concern are fees; it seem if you *deposit* USD funds then they are reasonable (0% with bank funds and 3.5% with a CC). My question is - if you fund an account with a CC is it a *cash advance* to the CC or a *charge* - very different rates apply to each. Thanks.

Not difficult to invest in Alts: explore the Binance interface for an hour to understand it all. Then transfer ETH (fast and cheap) from GDAX to Binance and - after researching the Alt options *carefully* select a few. I've done well there recently with XRP, XMR, IOTA, Qtum and a few others, but not great with ZEC.
Still, I have 70% in BTC.

I only meant that if a foundation received a donation thats *not* fungible fiat it has a duty to explore that asset and maximize it efficacy. That might involve keeping some / selling some, diversification to Alts (e.g. staying within crypto) and all other manner of hedging / increasing the value received. You know like Harvard.

It means that traders in Chicago this evening when pressed to make binding Contracts on their expected price of a Bitcoin next Wednesday bet at 10:05pm that the price will be $18,005.00.
I wrote this earlier when the Contracts were at 16,820 - you should read the link below too.
The Futures Traders at the Cbeo determined (bet - with lots of money) this evening that by next Wednesday at 2:45 (the predetermined expiration date for this evening's Contract) the price of a Bitcoin will be (by mutual agreement between the longs and the shorts) $16,820. That may or may not be the actual price next Wednesday - its a bet.
This Futures Contract has no effect (except psychological) on the price of BTC tonight or at any time through next Wednesday - and beyond for that matter. The price of a Bitcoin will be what it actually is on the various exchanges (CB, GDAX...). The Futures Market are dependent on our markets - not the other way round as long as we don't let it get in our heads. HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:11:07
I really don't follow. The rich who were/are already rich get richer because of BTC; or the Bitcoin buyers between its inception and, say, January 2018 get richer by way of buying BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:21:15
Where on this chart is the green?
Of course, you don't wanna be buying at an intermediate peak. Research XRP - it'll still be here tomorrow...
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:31:17
Theoretically correct - except Futures are entirely *synthetic* - no actual BTCs change hands. Its all cash.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:12:19
First - don't buy / sell on CB - inaccurate and fees. Second- to "redeem" your BTC to USD just SELL them - and use a Limit if possible. I'll post a link to an Explainer on UTube...
GDAX Tutorials:   
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:38:36
Yep - and *holding actual Bitcoin will beat the fund every time.* is key here; in a Trust or ETF you will never own a BTC - you are just investing cash on the hopes of a rising BTC price and if it does you'll gain cash only.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:47:06
Minimal. Especially considering the scale here.

All about GDAX platform - illustrated:  
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:30:05
OK. I ask because I read that a lot of the underlying tech could be implemented without any 'connection' to their coins. Can't figure out how to determine that possibility from White Papers or G searches; seems to be a gray area. The *Open Source* nature of these presents all kinds of outcomes IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:30:05
Correct. One side will gain some cash and the other will lose some - they are *locked into the Contract*. But neither will get ANY Bitcoins at all.
BTW - the newer (this evening) Futures contract is now valued at **16,980**. Each participant can hold only 5 Contracts - issued when they find a counter party. All in all, its *a vote of confidence* in a rising BTC price especially after 3 hours of trading at Cbeo.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:31:05
Since the Futures began the range has been between 15,020 and 15,900 which might be the "stabilization" WS seeks. But it also might be a message to us that this is the new BTC Range.

@_date: 2017-12-12 12:22:05
OK. Noob question: The "key" is the string of numbers &amp; letters that is revealed, say, when I go my CB BTC wallet, hit Receive and then "show address" - correct?
My "seed" is another string that, say, CB generated for my account is case I can't use 2FA or lose my phone - correct?
If correct - how do these appear in GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:32:51
I took your statement as to how to convert your BTC to USD on the GDAX exchange, so I sent the YT link. Once you have the USD secure on GDAX then you go to the 'withdraw' button on the left and send them to your linked bank account. Sorry for the confusion. The entire YT series is helpful if you plan to use GDAX frequently. Cheers.

Thanks for the perspective. Any idea *why* Asian markets are expecting a rally? Could it be CME Futures on Monday? [CME is much bigger in general, its BTC Contract are 5BTC as opposed to 1BTC at CBeo and the duration is 3 Months not 1 at Cbeo.]
Also - where can I monitor the activity and prices on the Asian Exchanges? Thanks.

Beyond CB &amp; GDAX I've only used used Kraken and Binance. But am waiting on approval from Gemini and Bitstamp.  There are many more - all have their peculiarities; research what works best for your goals.
Beyond BTC, ETH and LTC the only others I've bought are Ripple and IOTA. Research well...

Very logical analysis - and likely correct, so a question: would the up and coming altcoins to look for have real-world solutions (which both IOTA and Ripple have to a degree) or would it be just watching for popular "fad" coins (not to denigrate your Father-in-law - Im 63!) but could a fad start with as small an issue as just a low price, for example?  And do you have any favorite coins or favorite crypto / blockchain sectors?
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:29:40
But 'fully corrected' from where? October, November or December? This isn't like a stock - it has no "baseline" value. That said it seems from its 17,600 peak on 12/7 there is a 'floor' of sorts at 13,500 ish. But the Futures tonight might well change everything.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:41:02
Partly because CB presents it like a video game with FB addiction attributes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:43:29
Since the exchanges are independently managed and can set their own rules - and tho I guess this could easily evaded - have any ever set limits on sale blocks??

Any suggestions for a portfolio manager program (not app) that will pull in from GDAX, Binance, Poloniex using an API and generates useful comparisons?

This is the 3rd or 4th time I've read about "manipulation" just this afternoon - could you elaborate please?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:16:57
Thanks Vet. I appreciate the cautions, [I have all of 5% of my net investments in coins (majority in cash, stocks, etfs) so I am being careful.]  My question was about theorizing that whales are shaking weak hands of their coins by engineering exchange pullbacks - and just where these coins were before the weak hands obtained them - especially over the last 4 weeks or so as the media drew so much mainstream attention. Basically what is the *Coin In / Out Cycle*. Thanks - just tying to understand...
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:53:54
Yes, *but* this rally up to 19000 has energized new entries and this swift crash has probably burned them so the next rise will be more cautious with less participation - it'll happen just slowly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:54:55
Just hold - this isn't a horse race track. Give it time...
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:06:26
OK - thanks again. So BTC and ETH etc are both public BCs and public CCs while XRP is a private BC (requiring Invitation &amp; Permission) but a *public* CC.
How do you weigh those conflicting attributes in potential future value?
And, yes - any criteria for spotting the Google vs AltaVista or Facebook vs MySpace?
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:15:24
Personally, I would split it since no one knows what the Futures will start doing this evening at 6pm. The Futures could make it go either way:   
I'm planning on selling 50% of my BTC by 4pm and then see what happens by Monday &amp; Tuesday.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:40:31
I think the situation is that BTC is the *Godfather* of cryptocurrencies and it has the most value and owners - one of whom - BCH - is a major rival and this rivalry is being played out right now in a big way. So its being hit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:11:34
Not sure about that it starts in Chicago - at **5:30** Central. [EDIT]

Believe that you "pull" from GDAX - go to "Deposit" on upper left for CB funding option.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:20:20
OK. I think the prevailing sentiment on this sub is just wrong right now - this is a classic *buying opportunity*.
Unless you think BlockChain technology (more accurately **Distributed Ledger Technology**) is garbage; and that ~10 years of *Bitcoin et al.* development and advancement is an illusion (a pretty long bubble don’t ya think); and that all the banks, tech companies, hedge funds and many industries and corporations currently using and / or planning to use and invest billions into DLT are lying to the press and their shareholders - then you should be buying some stakes in this now.
No one knows who will be the big (medium or small) *winners* in BC - just like they didn’t know the winners when the Net exploded in the late 1990s - but they will emerge and grow.
IMO, you should be doing (as I am) what every venture capitalist has been doing for over 20 years - space out your bets (weighted, if you have strong feelings) on the most promising 10 or so *blockchain start-ups* i.e. - coins - so you have an equity stake in this emerging tech.
Some will fail, a few will establish reasonably profitable enterprises  and perhaps 2 or 3 will skyrocket; the profits from the rockets should  (and historically do) more than cover the losses in the laggards.
And we are a million miles from the mergers and acquisitions phase  that occurs in any fast moving tech - big corps let the start ups invent and fight it out and then scoop them up when the dust clears.
This is an incipient and crucial part any business cycle - creators, disruptors and first movers are shrouded in the fog of this coin frenzy. And right now they are cheap.
**Dips are when you buy.**
But - *only if you can afford to invest, monitor, adjust and be patient* - and that determination is unique to everyone on the sub.
Good luck.

So, as I haven't seen any "rationale" offered for the BTC surge that began at 10:45pm EST - my *guess* is that a lot of interested but very busy workers and professionals finally set aside (from their busy schedules) Friday evening and into the night to dig into the Bitcoin phenom and in steady chunks of $500 to $5,000 bought-in. Just a theory - anyone have any other data / theories?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:39:50
I wouldn't do anything - its stuck (by chance or design) in a tight range. The Order Book at GDAX is lacking in big blocks - up or down. I think the whales are sitting this out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:21:47
Remember the "... the exact price at which the futures contracts are settled is an area ripe for manipulation and fraud because the contracts are ultimately *based on what’s happening on the cash bitcoin exchanges."*
The Futures are dependent on the spot market - *our market.* And at the end of every 'contract' these traders only gain or lose some Cash - NONE of them get Bitcoins for the future.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:43:01

Hmm, you - and it seems a select few here - are highly knowledgable about these issues and I appreciate the reply. But it seems to me you are making a case for the societal benefits of *blockchain technology*  vis a vis the internet which I think *is* valid - especially longer term. But for the moment cryptocurrencies seem to be benefiting the few with insight (or luck) much like the early domainer days (Frank Schilling et al) when everybody was up in Vancouver getting rich from ad clicks. I'm not being critical here. Its just, granted there is work involved in mining etc - back in 1994 you couldn't just *buy*, say, 1% *of the entire fintech future*. Now it seems every billionaire actually could. You see?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:57:01
Bitcon is certainly a very speculative investment, but it was preceded by and established with decades of cryptological mathematics and the odd combination of cyberpunk and libertarianism. Shatoshi's vision in his white paper and code implementation was a culmination many years of hard work; so there is something of value there. I think the question isn't - is it a viable alternative to fiat currency?  The question is will Governments, Central Banks and the people accept it in consensus.

I think it was -Vet- last night who reminded me of the original intent of Bitcoin and we shouldn't lose sight of that. Bubbles may happen and then recede, but originally:
"...the reason most people are buying BTC is because of exactly what you said...they think the price will go up. They don't give a fuck about the technology, they don't understand private/public keys, they don't understand the blockchain (+ merkle trees, etc), they don't understand what bitcoin mining is even doing.
When I got into bitcoin there was a very different vision. It was about flipping the system on its head, allowing you to send money wherever you wanted for (basically) free. This was supposed to allow hundreds of millions of unbanked individuals to benefit from an open financial system. It was supposed to allow people in countries with rampant hyperinflation like Venezuela (I used to have a venezuelan friend who I lost contact with during the waves of violence under maduro) to get their money out of a centralist / fascist shithole (while avoiding inflation so that they could feed their families).
None of that is part of the vision anymore. The vision is to make BTC yet another asset for rich people to jerk off to and trade while those will small amounts of BTC get fucked. Who else is supposed to use BTC besides the ultra rich if the network can only process 6 transactions per second?"

Help please - to clarify CB funding: I have a 1K Bank Transfer still "pending" since Thursday. If I buy BTC from that account do I lock-in my buy price now - and pay when the transfer clears?  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:07:36
Some say there is no low price now. If BTC goes up to 50K or 100K (which is quite possible) then its like buying stock in Amazon: it really doesn't matter if you bought that at $10 or $20. Right.

I agree Vet that destroying BTC et al. is the Banksters goal - I just don't see how they could manipulate / recruit BCH to play a role. And what was the technique used? Can you elaborate, please?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:32:40
For one thing I think the fact that BTC Futures *rose* above the spot price is an endorsement of the technology, likely ensuring its continued development and funding; which can only be good for its coin-price as that is the asset endorsed.
Secondly, the Futures have forced WS and VCs (who didn't get it) to explore and fund / develop the tech - also increasing the asset.
Beyond the BTC itself is the BC Technology and BTC is the First Mover - and the coin owners have that technology. The Cbeo folks are just trading paper  - not BTC - every 30 days for a shot at a profit. Many will (or many others will) be inspired to invest in the actual BTC itself.
All in all a positive IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:03:10

Missing the point I think. So they immediately become *fiat* hedge funds - gathering and pooling fiat for worthwhile causes. The point, I think asked, was do they *gamble* that the *value* of the cryptocurrency will increase or decrease.

**Trading Question**
So, there’s a reason I couldn’t get through CalcIII when in university. There is something fundamental that I’m missing when I calculate a currency conversion for making Limit orders:
Say **XTC** is trading at 9039USD or 15ETH and I want to buy it for 8437USD which, when I use cryptonator.com/converter at 22:00-UTC, it calculates 8437USD to be 14ETH.
So, I place a Limit Order for 14ETH at that time. One hour later (at 23:00-UTC) my order has been Filled at 14ETH.
But now - at 23:05-UTC - when I plug 14ETH into the calculator the USD value of my **XTC** is *8395USD* - not my intended goal of 8437USD - *or 42USD less*.
I know there is something *seriously wrong* (e.g.: dumb) here (along with my thought process) - and its to do with the Exchange Rates of the USD to ETH; and its fluctuations over time.
Can anyone help and/or point me to the answers and the basic theory that I’m missing?  Thanks.

This range is just the starting point for Cbeo. They just want stability and liquidity to get confidence going - eventually bigger speculators will weigh in:
*"If someone wants to bet big that bitcoin is going down — say, by shorting 1,000 bitcoin contracts — there needs to be one or more traders willing to take the opposite side. That liquidity may not be there from Day One. As the futures market grows, large institutional money will increasingly influence the price of bitcoin. If bitcoin derivatives become larger than the underlying cash market for bitcoin, Wall Street’s opinion will have an outsized effect on bitcoin prices. That might be bullish or bearish."*

I'd encourage everyone to read this later - and read between-the-lines. **Volatility will return.**

Yep - that's the Fiat game. I see you are versed in this - The status quo suits the Banksters etc. very well; in fact they would lose control without the system and they are powerful Trillions vs BTCs Billions.

@_date: 2017-12-28 13:08:08

And that is a real shame especially at this juncture given the prominent media attention BC / Cryptos are receiving, the political environment and the heightened protectionist attitudes of the Central Banks and all banks who have a big stake in either the status quo or 'controlling' the roll out of digital currencies. The decentralized folks should be standing together - but it'll be a long game in some respects given the technology; I think the Fed Cartels wanna slam this down asap in the mind of the public so they, you know, don't start actually reading books and non-fiction again.

@_date: 2017-12-22 09:46:16
But the attack was on BTC - the Alts only *reacted* to BTCs slide.
One of the problems with investing in the coins is that its a homogenous universe of choices. Its like if you had to build a profitable and market-beating portfolio and only being able to choose from Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Microsoft and Apple; you couldn't build a *blow-out basket* because they move (largely) in lock step relative to the universe of NYSE, and even NASDAQ, stocks. So, you don't pick and choose - you buy the sector.

Apparently a hedge fund bought 0.9 Billion XRPs over the last 36 hours. Bloomberg added XRP to its BBTerminal last week. Rumors are that 1) Amazon is very interested in it and, 2) that Coinbase may add it in early 2018. And it gets good press:

So, since the period you mention (2008 -2010) which was the trough  of the Recession and the beginnings of the Recovery which was very *uneven across sectors* which made ETFs a *safer* bet are you proposing that the Institutional traders are deploying the same strategy with cryptos? Bet on them *all* without much weighting for now until *winner / leaders* become clearer? If so, is there anything at all in the tea leaves at all to differentiate institutional favorites?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:23:56
Sure am, but I can't otherwise figure a surge on Friday evening  through the night. Looming CME Futures maybe, but it seemed *organic* not Bankster strategic.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:38:49
Odd. I just login to CB - open a new tab and go to GDAX - hit LOG IN and it automatically opens to my account.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:49
Valid to a degree. But don't forget the impact of Cbeo Futures (12/10) and CME Futures (12/18). They were  disruptive and inherently FUD-like. EDIT: at least the "U" part.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:42:34
Also, when you write, "It’s more like saying invest in..." - is *investing* in a coin the same in some, or all/many, cases as actually having a stake in the future of the underlying technology?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:56:29
OK - I'm not a broker, but I don't see how that's *easy* as they are prohibited from buying or selling BTC. How would they legally hedge?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:52:54
GDAX - its easier and less fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:20:40
Sounds like you did considerable research looking for a coin manager. I have too, but have yet to find one that has the quality of Blockfolio and either:
An iOS program that has an *auto API data import* function
An OSX program that has an *auto API data import* function.
Anything like that in your research? Cointracking.info has the auto import but has poor analysis and is expensive..
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:44:10
Not sure what you mean by "dead", but it occurred to me that the Cbeo now has *some* influence on BTC - but none on ETH and LTC so that's where the flow is. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:29:11
Don't have the links handy, but from what I've read the GBTC Bitcoin Investment Trust has excessive fees and values BTC below what its real or "spot" price is - further, its returns are below par. I'd look elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:36:10
Be cautious, BTC is so volatile - but if you are looking to make gains of $500 or less I'd suggest getting a GDAX account and use their Limit Buys &amp; Sells to catch the falls and rises.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:41:25
I went to Binance initially just to get some Alts, but they just *handle the orders and numbers* straight-up fine. I only have a small percentage of total there and have yet to do a withdrawal, but they seem OK and are listed all over in articles etc. Gemini is ok - but, what just 3 coins I think. Can't get Poloniex to read my ID on web cam...

Sure, maybe by 11:30am when reactionary fiat forces muster the troops. I'm sure they have plans for this eventuality - in fact this rally could be an integral part of the plan. Panic at lunchtime when the glow fades and buyers remorse sets in and your auto-pay confirmations hit your in-box. Do Not Panic. Its the oldest trick - primal fear. HODL.

One that is sorta OK is Daily FX:  
Agree GDAX seems to be falling apart - their charting is absurdly bad right now - and they can't even get their 'Status' updates correct.

Anyone else having huge delays in transferring BTC and ETH *out* of CB/GDAX - like to Binance et al.?

Yet isn't the reverse true for cost average buying (assuming a rising asset) - buy all on *day one* at, say, 100 instead of 30 at 100, 103, 106, 102, 110 etc? Timing is hindsight.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:25:48
Good to know and hear your views. Back in June I started gaining  interest in Blockchain (while my real focus was AI investing:ROBO, BOTZ, NVDA, BABA, BIDU, AAPL etc ) and BC seemed too esoteric and 'back office'. By October I waded into CCs, but not enough. Since then I've studied a lot and it seems this is not a BTC bubble per se - its a a new paradigm that may well play out like the Internet did between, say, late 2000 and 2005 (but at hyper-speed) - which is when Google, FB and true adoption / leverage too place. Gonna be a good ride for those who do their homework everyday. There should be a **Blockchain Implementation Investors Group** on /r IMO.
EDIT: One other point - Google didn't go public until 2004 and FB not tie 2012 - while these 'coins' are essentially public now (however unregulated). Point is, you couldn't get in the door of either before their IPOs without connections and millions...
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:57:31
How in the name of all that is good could you possibly do and know these things? ATH, rebound, large dip, bull trap, stay, slowly start working upwards *except* in hindsight? Really please?

Well, also, not to be a conspiracy theorist, but the *financial establishment's* status quo must be preserved and BTC et al. are threats to the system. Collectively they have Trillions - knocking cryptos down (at least enough to harness for themselves) is a current priority. And they do have deep pockets. *BUT* we are patient...
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:28:43
Thanks for the insight - I'll need to read up on at least the *conceptual side* of things; any materials / sources you recommend?

@_date: 2017-12-12 17:54:15
Its a reasonable time to take notice of bitcoin and alt coins and do some research to determine if this is for you - so, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:25:35
Hows that? XRP is down from $1.16 six hours ago to $0.89 right now...
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:16:46
The *Establishment* has spoken (at least on Futures Day 1) on the near term outlook for BTC. And its mixed, but its evident very few are willing to "short" it right now:
"The two-month contract was trading at $17,970 a 10 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 11 percent premium.
Despite being modest when compared with bitcoin’s 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still showed a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin.
*“Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn’t happen on day one doesn’t mean it won’t in the future.”*
"Sayed added that the arbitrage trading should lead to “improved price efficiency and probably less volatility. After volatility settles down, investors will focus again on price direction, he said."

OK - thanks. I guess there just isn't one (which is a shame b/c the manual entry is time consuming and error prone), so allow me to reframe the Q: did find *any* crypto managers that allows the use of exchange APIs - currently I'm diversifying into over 15 Alts and the manual entry side of that is a major time vortex.
Thanks again!

I've always employed DCA for stocks as its a good method. But BTC etc. has *excessive* volatility. I would enter the buy orders for a weekly buy, but then check the price level / trend 2 hours before execution time and alter as needed.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:12:08
Yes - I believe you can only deposit and buy other coins with BTC at Binance.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:49:17
I have a related scenario question:
So, does Blockchain.info allow for easy / low fee transfers to and from GDAX vs a physical wallet?
Say I have ~ 2K (USD) in BTC, ETH and LTC on GDAX and want to keep it *reasonably secure* yet still want to be able to trade / exchange without too much hassle / fees back at GDAX - would you recommend using Blockchain as a *more* secure safe-place in between active trading days?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:56:39
There IS fear in the Futures. Brokers are demanding 50% for Long bets  - but 240% for Shorts. A Short gone wrong (i.e.: BTC Spot soars) and losses are *theoretically unlimited* - at the very least the losses could be multiples of the initial bet.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:32:15
Im confused on this issue: XRP isn't (as I understand it) intended to be used by almost anyone except financial institutions which by their nature *like* a degree of centralization; it simply reduces their friction and fees by ~ 75%. So why wouldn't it be in long term usage and thus valuable to them and as a protocol?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:32:57
Im new to this, but not to investing and some day trading stocks. Coinbase was my start and very quickly (2 days) moved to GDAX . While its a huge improvement it is lacking - unless my settings are wrong:
Fills are only shown in the *specific coin-view* you are in - not *all* Fills.
Fill list is just that - a List with no Cost Average.
No specifics on the time line on the X Axis - in any of the increment views.
Only 6 timeframe (1 M to 1 D) options.
And much more...
Does anyone know where the *Fidelity Active Trader Pro* of cryptos might be? Or can GDAX be modified though its Settings to be customized?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:39:22
Gemini has a good reputation and is used by Cbeo for futures benchmark. Try Binance for IOTA.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:03:29
So they are pulled just before they hit the spread - risky isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:12:53
Well, I do. It has good goal and guidance:
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:48:16
Cbeo Futures now and CME starting Monday am.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:00:36
Its still unevenly distributed - like the Future.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:05:13
I guess I missed some news - why the growing sentiment that BTC is headed down - specifically in the next 2 to 5 days?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:28:50
Its both simple and complex - start here:  
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:55:59
I like Gemini for BTC and ETH. And use Binance for Alts. No problems with either.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:07:39
Nice concise explanation - thanks. A question: it seems XRP is *disliked* in much of the open Blockchain community because it is centralized and assists FR banking, but that doesn't preclude it adoption (or even wide adoption) by the financial sector and therefore making it highly profitable much sooner than a *universal* decentralized open currency?
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:04:09
Sure, XRB is shilled all over, but is its tech as good as XRP?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:47:46
Well, one trader thinks (to the tune of $3M) that BTC will hit 50K in 2018:
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:49:30
I could only get it on Binance - a little spooky...
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:56:34
Not sure about that scenario... Big Player can short (or go long) just the synthetic future contract - settled in USD which never owns BTC. Big Player is prohibited by law from trading BTC directly. GXBT is unlike most futures as it has no underlying commodity like oil, grain or pork bellies - which are influenced by real life events.
Cbeo just wants a new gambling table.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:46:09
That's exactly what Cbeo wants - us out. Don't leave.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:59:21
Nope. The underlying technology and potential for BTC (and other good cryptos) have huge adoption potential. BTC could trade well into  a 25K to 50K range. The Future boys want that to themselves. This is (and will be for a while) all Theater to discourage us and leave the prize to Wall Street - don't let them do that. HODL and TRADE when you can.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:35:09
Here ya go - its for equities, but the same rules apply:  
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:07:24
First, CB is very inaccurate - only good for a 'big time-based picture'. But all the exchanges vary a bit (ARBITRAGE!). Right now CEX has BTC at $14,555 and GDAX has it at $14,050 - others will vary too. GDAX is CBs parent company and its tools are great - you just gotta watch a couple of explanatory videos - and you can do Limit Trades.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:10:21
It will likely be a long process and develop in stages as adoption takes hold in various sectors and markets.
"...institutional algorithmic/high-frequency trading..." takes place in fiat currencies, so that by itself doesn't preclude its use as a store of value - much like gold; nor some cryptos' use in some institutional settings. As for "... the promised land of borderless unregulated currency." we believe it is a moral imperative to work towards that goal.
Given your experience and viewpoints from the "(equities and fixed income)" world - I would love to hear more from you, yes, please share.
[I am no expert]
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:09:44
Funny (at least for the moment) the Cbeo contracts *bet* on a BTC price of 16,800 [EDIT: price *next* Wednesday]  at 8:50pm - we just *passed* that. **The latest contract at 10:05pm is for $18,005.00**.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:34:48
Secondly, GDAX, like CB, is understaffed and things are slow there - as long as you got the wallets correct it should show up.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:07:19
Agree, but if BTC has to add that level of speed universally (not dedicated just to Financials) it might take 6 months, 1 year ... more. XRP is trail-ing now - maybe in-use by February in Asia. How long will Banks wait for *their* solution?
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:05:13
Help, advice please. I’m starting to accumulate an unwieldy portfolio of DGAX coins and a bunch of Alts like QTUM, IOTA, XRP, NEO, ZEC, XMR  and others - and I’m getting dizzy keeping track of everything. Can anyone advise on the pros and cons of the following - or others:
I would like to be able to import from the 2 or 3 exchanges I use, but do not understand what some call an **API**. Do I need to surrender *my information* for the convenience of an online portfolio manager?
Also, a similar recommendation for a safe (but I think *not* hardware - as I plan to determine what’s for long term as I go on) wallet that can handle multiple coins would be appreciated as well.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:02:33
Well? LOL, Really? Could see it coming man - I went through 1987; one gets second senses about these things. But - should be a great buying app if it goes down another 15%.
