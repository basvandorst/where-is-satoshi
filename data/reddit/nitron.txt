Ahh, the ol' .jpg.exe trick, classic. This binary should be lulzy. Thanks!

I did a really quick analysis (made easy because it's a .NET binary)...This is a clever-ish idea, but terribly-written malware.
The short version is that it watches your clipboard for Bitcoin addresses, then replaces it with one from its list of addresses. It even tries to find the one that's "closest" to the one in the clipboard, in hopes that you won't notice. The clever-ish part is that it doesn't need any sort of network access.
I'll put up a more detailed blog post with real analysis tonight, and the list of addresses to watch.
Thanks again for the sample!

Did you happen to get a copy of the binary? Looks like it's been taken down/moved.

Interestingly, zero results for all of them. Looks like someone has already posted the sample to [malwr.com](

I did. I'm a security researcher and I followed some basic precautions to prevent infection (most notably not running Windows).
It's a zip file containing a few photos (that presumably are not of you), named "DCM_0001.jpg", with increasing numbers. "DCM_0005.jpg.exe" is the actual malware. They're taking advantage of the default setting on Windows to hide file extensions for known file types, so this wouldn't be obvious to many users.
I won't be able to really dig into the binary until tonight, but my guess is that this is HackForums-level low-quality malware.
Interestingly, the zip file contains a "__MACOSX" directory, which implies that the zip file was created on a Mac.

When using deterministic wallets, is it possible to derive the master public key from a Bitcoin address? That is, if I tell you that one of my addresses is X, could you then figure out the MPK and know all of my addresses?
What if you know multiple addresses?
It seems like the term "master public key" is sort of a misnomer...It should still be a secret, but it's also not the key the kingdom, so to speak. Is that an accurate way of thinking about it? I guess "master semi-private key" would've been too confusing of a term.
