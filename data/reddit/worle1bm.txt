I find that I am more inclined to "troll" threads when people say things like this. It's fucking nonsense. "Entrenched financial and political interests are very concerned"? What does that even mean?
If these powerful people want to kill bitcoin they could do it very rapidly. The fact that bitcoin has been allowed to exist and expand is proof that the powers that be either don't care or will use the technology to their own benefit in the future. It's utter nonsense to maintain the bitcoin narrative of "disrupting" the political or economic status quo, and assume there is a vast conspiracy of "entrenched" interests trying to kill it.

I think the author is observing a reality that is lost on the majority of the bitcoin community. A cursory look at threads demonstrates the outright disdain that 'enlightened' bitcoin users feel for the average person, how stupid and unsophisticated these average people are. The only person more hated is anyone who dares to doubt bitcoin, or poke holes in the narrative constructed around bitcoin. That attitude is prevalent and appalling. 
Bitcoin users are niche without realizing why; the greater context of the financial system is lost on them. The author is pointing this out and I think it is both accurate and relevant.

It's also a part of contract law. You sign a contract, even if you don't notice the small print, and you're held to it. Does Bitcoin mean we are no longer obligated to abide by contracts we don't like?

To start with, people don't need a reason to exit stocks. Stocks are a fantastic financial mechanism to limit risk, gain wealth, and stay relatively liquid. The markets are not "crashing", where are you getting this from? 
Yes, investors crave returns without strong risk. BTC is incredibly risky and volatile and the vast majority of investors and financial professionals won't touch it with a 10 foot pole. Riskier portfolios could have an argument for including a volatile investment, but BTC is both questionable and volatile. This is without even considering the regulation aspect, the fact that normal insurance that traders carry doesn't cover BTC, etc. etc. There are a hundred little hurdles to get over before the one huge hurdle, that BTC may not be a good investment. 
Another consideration, and this should be blindingly obvious, BTC has a market cap of billions and a relatively illiquid supply. Not everyone can own BTC and get it at a beneficial price. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:48:35
Yeah, in a broader sense skin in the game is having a stake in the outcome. When Buffet coined the term it was a response to a query about a stock price, and the person asking didn't personally own any, so they had no skin in the game.

Gotcha, so in a pure world the only transactions are ones you OK from your wallet. You can accomplish the same thing by paying in cash or check for your gym and not giving them your credit card. 
The mechanism that enables these types of payments from your credit card gives flexibility in the form of credit. That's the benefit of having a credit card. What I am saying is that Bitcoin doesn't prevent this same system from operating, and I think it would intuitively have to operate because consumers use credit cards constantly. So while Bitcoin in this one anecdotal instance may prevent this charge, it doesn't shift the payment paradigm.

Again, very lazy arguments. The dollars purchasing power hasn't "fallen drastically" in real terms. 
97%, where is this statistic coming from? I've seen more reputable estimates around 90%, but that isn't discerning between M0, M1, M2 assets which makes a world of difference when you want to talk about how much wealth is liquid. 
I don't think credit means what you think it means. You keep saying the Fed enables credit, what do you think credit is? The Fed bailing banks out, banks that are "systemically" important doesn't make the value of money irrelevant, either. Notice money is still valuable. Bitcoin is incredibly volatile, much more so than the dollar. How would this promote a more stable system? Neither does Bitcoin prevent fractional banking and loans, the same system of finance could be delivered via Bitcoin. The mechanisms apply equally. 
The "wars of our times" did not hinge on a "credit bubble" or the money supply. Could you expand on this? I'm not sure I'm getting what you're saying, or maybe you're misusing he terms. A case could be made for central banking making funding easier, but warfare doesn't hinge on money supply. That's a really odd notion. A quick review of history kind of makes that clear.

What is the theory that makes it 'better money'? Money is a means of exchange. Bitcoin enables exchange, but it certainly has requirements for use. The internet. Wallets. Security. Handing $20 to another person for some food is a 'built in transaction system'. 


This is your political/economic view. If you don't think the dollar is useful, don't use it. This is not a universal truth. This is not a widely held opinion. If you break out of the Reddit/Bitcointalk circle-jerk to the regular world you will find that the common opinion is that dollars still do the job just fine. In order for the average user to adopt a new means of exchange, they have to be given a strong incentive in one form or another. Bitcoin doesn't have that. 


Who is this 'we'? The "solution" to the financial crisis isn't bitcoin. The root of the crisis was leverage, and bitcoin doesn't prevent leverage. That's more of a function of regulation and financial risk management. 


Oh lord, spare me. The "corruption at the center of civilization". Are you serious? Walk into a room of adults, try to pitch Bitcoin by starting with this. This is the kiddie shit I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 18:07:26
Money is not the heart of the economy. Look, work with *me* here. You need to expand your understanding of this topic. You fundamentally don't understand what function money provides, or what function you are suggesting Bitcoin could provide.

@_date: 2014-11-14 05:54:31
Because it's unrealistic. Bitcoin will never exist in a world without state backed currencies. This requires payment processors, financial service providers, and means of exchange.

Or they'll buy as much as possible, destroy the liquidity of the coin, and destroy Bitcoin in the process. 
 
If Bitcoin were truly the huge "threat" folks here think it is to banking, they would simply destroy it. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:54:30
For the wealthy, they have access to tools of preserving wealth that far surpass BTC. Hard assets, proven assets, even illiquid assets, are an easy fix. Property, art, uncommon goods, etc. BTC is a brand new, unproven, difficult to insure or estimate risk, asset. Not a good choice. 
The same logic applies to government bail-ins, which is not pretty much everywhere, contrary to your FUD statement. Holding a piece of art, or land, or any hard asset with a third party prevents a government bail-in, which is again, very unlikely. 
The case for BTC being a store of value falls apart very quickly when placed against other assets available to store value more securely, with proven returns and reliability, and a broad market for exchange. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:20:30
What countries?
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:19:49
That would depend on more variables. Volatility, insurance, regulation, security, to name a few. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:09:13
I wish I could believe you. This community needs to grow up. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 20:09:56
If he, and you by proxy, are talking about the M0, I would suggest that it is basically irrelevant to the argument. The fear of "printing" too much money stems from heuristic moments of hyperinflation; we can all recall images of stacks of worthless currency. The current financial system behind the dollar makes this concern implausible. 
Purchasing power is a different discussion altogether. Anecdotal review of purchasing power shows that the dollar has apparently suffered a massive decrease in "power". A more robust review of the dollar, that factors currency to currency comparison, price indices, and the transient nature of currency possession gives a more accurate look.
Almost no one holds dollars year over year for 50 or 100 years. We buy stuff. Purchasing power in conjunction with average wage is a better representation of what workers expect to be able to purchase for normal labor. So again I would say these surface-level arguments are not accurate, and do not support Bitcoin adoption. 
What does support Bitcoin adoption, in my view, is transaction simplicity, lowered costs, decentralized control, and commodity-like investment opportunities. I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast, just not in the way that you, and this other fellow want me to be, apparently.

People will try to maintain the value of their assets through mitigating risk, as in less volatile assets. BTC is not less risky, it is incredibly risky. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 05:35:10
Bitcoin is "indispensable" for "risk mitigation"? Holy moly. An incredibly volatile asset without significant history, no regulation, technology that is new, security that demands constant vigilance as there is no means of recourse, lack of insurability, and an illiquid asset pool is "indispensable" for "risk mitigation"? Man, those rich folks sure are stupid. Could you talk more about the "unique set of safeguards"? 
Your sources are from theory, and are anecdotal. Could bail-ins happen? Possibly. Is it likely? Not really. A bail-in would draw from liquid money supply, hopefully temporarily, but would do long term harm to the economy at large, which is why nations avoid them. Capital flight is of course the first concern. Playing the 'what-if' game isn't risk mitigation, it's pretend time. This is more BTC cheerleading without substance. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 06:58:56
Sorry you're being downvoted for applying logic.

I value privacy, fast transactions, and technology. I don't give a shit about "statist" concerns, because you've attributed roles and ideals to Bitcoin that are arbitrary, and not inherent. 
In my view, the largest limiting factor for Bitcoin is not the technology, but the mentality of the community. I'm not looking for "anarcho-whatever" and "statist" blah blah in my method of transacting business. I sure don't need to hear about being "unenlightened" or the "singularity" or how we can all come together to share scarce resources. 
I need a means of exchange that is fast, secure, and private. That's it. Bitcoin can deliver that. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:31:58

Cool, so you've had an issue with a company not being transparent with charges, that's unfortunate and sucks. I've had the same issue with a gym.

A small note, and this is my review only, don't use Zerohedge for financial information. It's amateurs and worse giving cursory "analysis" of events. You can find better information.

Satoshi is not the driving force behind Bitcoin. He created it, but he doesn't own it. This pseudo-intellectual garbage about disrupting governments and the world financial system dooms Bitcoin to anecdotal inclusion.

So, to answer your last comment, I am not a skeptic. I both own BTC and work in the crypto industry. I am simply not a cheerleader of unrealistic beliefs and ideas. 
But, the OP is not talking about the transfer value or remittaces, he is suggesting BTC is an alternative to stocks, hence my reply. Your points about transfer value and such are a different argument altogether. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:01:13
Donations are not a new paradigm. Donating to a torrent is not a new paradigm. More cheerleading without substance.

That's a loaded question, "legitimate" is subjective to what your opinion is. Here are a few recent items, though.  
Western Union is apparently evil because they are trying to protect their business. WU has been a pretty impressive company in the past century, but any mention of them here is that they are anachronistic, behind the times, etc. No, they are protecting their interests against some upstart "online currency" that may or may not end up as anything. WU doesn't give a shit about the politics or the libertarian cause or any of the "bitcoin can change the world" posts. They want to stay in business and make money. Fuck. 
Or look at Mastercard. No shit MC wants to regulate bitcoin. If MC has to play by government rules to move money and process transactions they want the same rules to apply to all the players in that space. It's common sense. They aren't "evil" or "statist" or any of the nonsense on here. They're a business doing what a business does. 
How about Coinbase not allowing risky transactions? "oh my god, I've been wronged by the man and by the state and Ron Paul said this is bad because Coinbase won't let me buy my coins". Coinbase is working extremely hard to advance KYC/AML algorithms and operational procedures for digital currencies. They are contributing a huge amount to the community and they take nothing but shit for it. You want bitcoin to be mainstream? Guess what, you have to play by the mainstream rules. Coinbase is one of the best companies supporting bitcoin out there. Circle is doing the same, but less visibly. But what do users read on here? "Oh Coinbase won't let me buy coins because they are against libertarians and this is a conspiracy" its idiotic. 
And I can't even begin to count the number of "this wouldn't happen with bitcoin" posts about "fiat". Bitcoin is cited as a cure-all. Bank account stolen? "Can't happen with Bitcoin haha" Economy doing poorly? "Should use Bitcoin haha" Inflation? "Oh Bitcoin can't have inflation haha". It's never-ending. All this superficial analysis by internet economists and lawyers arrives at the same conclusion "Just use Bitcoin LOL it will fix everything LOLROFLCOPTER" 
I have bad news. Bitcoin is just another medium of exchange. It may end up being a little faster, and cause some payment processors or banks to improve or adapt, but Bitcoin is just another medium of exchange. That evil fiat money will still rule the world. The U.S. government isn't going to collapse into a Ron Paul circlejerk and decide to revert to a gold/Bitcoin standard. If Bitcoin becomes popular those evil banks will make money off of it. They already are, through VC activity. And the nail in the coffin? Bitcoin will probably fall by the wayside in favor of other users for blockchain-style technology applications. OMG no way! Yeah, way. Bitcoin has a tiny market cap with poor liquidity. It could disappear tomorrow and have no real impact. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:26:12
For your first assertion, from the article, that an IOU is "worth less" is a straw man argument. The article, and the source it draws from, sets up a fixed scenario of few variables to illustrate what the author desires. This is an arbitrary scenario, not a literal or practical scenario. I do not agree with the universal accuracy of a fake scenario, no. 
Second, a language or a framework does not equal money. That's a poor analogy and I reject the premise. Money as a mode of exchange fulfills a different use for society than language, and equating the longevity of one to the other does not make sense. I think your logic is flawed. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:55:36
No, wrong, 
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:59:36
Your rambling post doesn't really argue against his point, though. Promissory notes inherently hold the value of their promise; a dollar buys a dollar worth of goods. This remarkable system functions extremely efficiently. If you get away from the Austrian inclined economic view, a cursory comparison of modern finance to past finance shows how remarkably improved our system is. Property rights are internationally recongized(most places), enabling collateral and credit. 
As for who owns most of 'it', the money is in circulation and in accounts that exist in digital ledgers. Your guess is as good as mine as to who has most of it, or if you can categorize all those folks into one category. But it's lazy thinking like yours that flings together circumstances into "evidence", as though being rich carries the mark of being a bad person. Yes, wealthy people with many dollars own the defense companies that make weapons and tanks. Amazingly, many of these companies are publicly held companies. That means the shareholders, who are a wide swath of the nation, own the same companies. Mom and Pop who want to retire at 60 also stand to gain from these companies doing well. Are they equally culpable? Is the amount they stand to gain too little for you to cast circumstantial evidence their way?
Lastly the Fed does not quite "create the credit". Credit is a function of, and this is really simplifying it, the codification of property and rates and means of default. To suggest we are all "in debt" because of the national debt is pretty dramatic. Obviously the inverse is not true; we don't get richer when we run a surplus. And war, debt, and credit certainly predate "central banking" this apparent monolith that we can lay all evils upon and which BTC is going to slay. 
Stop being lazy. Read opposing views from educated folks, aticulate your own views based on evaluation, not what the 'cool kids' are preaching on Reddit. There is a joke that a friend once told me: Q: Why are there apparently so many more Austrians on the internet? A: Because all the real economists have jobs.

Examples that fit his argument. It's like setting up a straw man every time you need to knock one down. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:51:52
How are you going to get around KYC/AML considerations? I don't see how you can avoid them simply by being open-source. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:49:03
Yeah, that's a valid point. But there's a lot out there, I guess wallets are the place to start?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:12:17
Yeah, sure. I guess, in reading more, your client will pass those concerns to the end-user. Anyone receiving payments may have to worry about the taxes, incoming laws/rules, and substantiating it all if they are required to. 
This seems like an extremely attractive vector for money laundering, especially. One of the benefits of using Coinbase or other services is that the risk of these considerations is mitigated, and provides somewhat of a history for any funds incoming. 
Saying "goodbye KYC" because your system omits a way to know your customer seems iffy to me. You're omitting it as a requirement, but governments may not. It just strikes me as naive. You may want to consider bringing in someone with knowledge of compliance for some input. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 20:08:16

Yeah, Coinbase can definitely be tedious. They rely almost 100% on their algorithm, from what they say. That's opposite of most commercial entities where red flags dump out transactions to a human, typically someone who has been doing compliance for years, and makes a determination. 
I understand your intent, and the hyperbole certainly seems appealing. But I think that to create a robust product in this space you can't ignore KYC/AML, because many of your users can't.
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:34:04
Hahaha, no, it certainly does not.

What is the purpose of this post? It's a pointless anecdotal remark. Bitcoin is extremely volatile. One positive change doesn't alter that.

Because there is no advantage in using bitcoin in this situation. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:15:56
Because contrary to the community narrative, the current system is both fairly efficient, and beneficial. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:02:59
Or the price goes down, and they become very poor. Or the volatility causes their value to fluctuate wildly, causing other creditors to lose faith in their ability to make payments, or trust the payment system. Plus, they do have to pay for banking and treasury services because these are still needed for regulatory, security, and accounting purposes. 
The enthusiasm is great, but the naivete is omnipresent in this community. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:28:38
Man, I've been making that mistake too often, lately. Dunno why.

I support not having words put in my mouth because you lack the creativity to make a non-emotional argument that is based on experience rather than conjecture, and over-dramatic conjecture at that.

No, they're propaganda. It's the shit that feeds confirmation bias in certain crowds, like the crowd. There's a few nuggets of telling information in each, but the narrative portrayed is just that; narrative.

What good does that do for a nation? They don't give a crap about "putting higher demand on its scarcity", which is only one possible outcome. Why would a nation wager it's financial security on an unproven, relatively new digital asset? It makes no sense.

And mom and pop who can get a cheap mortgage, cheap car loan, have simple access to investment instruments, are insured against serious losses, can save for their kids college in a low risk way, on and on. The financial system has errors because it is a product of competing forces, but compare the availability of beneficial financial products to the average Joe in our current day to any time in the past, and the change is clear. Debt is not slavery, it can be, but it can also be a tool to better your education, lifestyle, living arrangement, etc. There will always be push and pull from those who will abuse the system, and those who won't accept that. Welcome to humanity. 
The "evil" system is pretty good at avoiding risk and making credit accessible. Its just this crowd with the "Banks are destroying the world" type argument, because its easy at 18 or 20 with basically no life experience to see only what is "wrong" with the world, rather than a fuller picture of where we came from to get here. The majority of users fall into a few, relatively unique categories.
If you look at the most important players in bitcoin or blockchain technology, none, or almost none, of them spout this nonsense about "elite bankers" and "unlimited fiat". They're business men and women, many from financial backgrounds. You'll find that narrative on the internet among a very select group, and no where else. It's the equivalent of the militia types living out in their bunkers. This is your bunker, right here, is where you can all get together and talk about how enlightened you are and that government/banks/anyone who disagrees is evil. 
So it always boggles my mind when folks here are surprised when bitcoin isn't being adopted more rapidly; because it doesn't have a significant advantage over the dollar for the average user. But I am not surprised that the appeal to the mainstream is so limited, especially in this sub. Look at the replies/downvotes I am getting for having a dissenting opinion? Unless I stick with the pro-bitcoin anti-bank narrative, anything I say will be downvoted. If a community cannot handle dissenting opinion, why do you think you'll do any better than the status quo? There is no plurality in the bitcoin community, it's 'follow one line of thought or else you are wrong'. That's silly to me, and counter-productive.
