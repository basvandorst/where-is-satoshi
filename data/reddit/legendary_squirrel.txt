Lol at the forever hodlrs thinking they have it all figured out. Enjoy the crash

The problem with your logic is, the price should drop right before Christmas when everyone cashing out, but should spike immediately after Christmas as everyone is spending all that money they received. The spike never happened

The fact that Bitcoin has lost 35 percent of its value and forever hodlrs continue to act like its nothing because of "history" proves that no one really knows what the fuck they're doing. It could go back up, it might crash to 0. At the end of the day, it's roulette 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:15:26
Yes, at the current moment in time. Considering it has no real competition yet, of course it would

The fact of the matter is, even if you fully believe in crypto, Bitcoin is just one of hundreds of crypto's out there. Bitcoin has severe limitations, and while it was the first, it's like the dinosaurs of crypto. It's a smooth ride to the top, but once people take you seriously and the competition starts, you're market share can only go down. Bitcoin is competing with hundreds of alts that, let's face it, have superior technology and scalability. To all you forever hodlrs out there, good luck. You'll need it

News flash: no one cares who the innovator was, or who was the first one to come up with an idea. You're just a footnote in history

I agree. And when it went from $20,000 to $11,000, that's a catastrophic loss. See how much more accurate it is to speak in absolute terms instead of relative. Percentages can manipulated to fit any narrative

You could literally say the same thing about ANY product. What can't be integrated into myspace? What can't be integrated into blockbuster? Any company can theoretically integrate anything, that's not the point. It doesn't matter that bitcoin was the first. If a company creates an identical clone, but is slightly better, that's all that matters

You have it reversed. If you have $1 and you make $1, it was 100% increase. If you have $100 billion and lose $50 billion, that's only 50% decrease. does that $1 increase mean more than the $50 billion decrease because the percentage was greater? Of course not 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:48:51
which is exactly my point
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:03:48
Actually, it's exactly like saying that. Google was not the first. Google came along and killed off the many search engines out there. Do you know who the first search engine was? No, because it doesn't matter

How? When it has never faced any competition from a major corporation. It's a smooth ride to the top until people start taking you seriously 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:43:54
That's the problem. Bitcoin only has value if it can actually be used as a currency. Once people start realizing that it can't be because the tech is limited, it's gonna crash 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:41:36
And a lot of people will. And the mainstream people that trust big companies will dwarf the niche community that has distrust. These companies are near trillion dollar companies for a reason
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:00:01
But there is a thing called inflation that happens when people make more money, so you can never end up with all. But Bitcoin has a hard cap at 21 million, and no more can be created. Bitcoin has some serious limitations

So I took out a 10k loan to buy in at 18500. Then I panick sold at 12300 a couple weeks ago when it crash. I took another 5k loan out to get back at 15300...and now this :( I lost 4k and owe the bank 15k plus 3k interest. FML. I have the worst luck. I'm beginning to think Bitcoin is a trap. IM OUT! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:00:46
What if they don't have to sell because they have, you know, real jobs? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:01:54
But an all Bitcoin ecosystem is fantasy. As long as dollars are around, they wouldn't have to do that
