The whole point of computers is that you set them up so they do work for you.

Glad to hear!

He should change his name to Johnny Bitcoin,
Johnny Cash is fucking awesome

Right, I mean that's why they're rolling out the bitcoin ATMs with smartphones right now. That's about as simple it's going to get

I think this is a great idea, I saw a post earlier promoting discounts at restaurants for using bitcoins. We could perhaps help promote our own community and their endeavours. Just an idea, me and my friends have been working on international music collaboration/hiring engineer app that allows people with likeminded interests get together and spend bitcoins in exchange for services in post-audio/film etc.
Anyway my point was that it's great to give to a charity to display bitcoin to the general public but I think it's more important to establish real social communities that bring real work/pay to the people of its community

I think it's really interesting but there's no real incentive besides the novelty of playing the game that way. If you added something like a pool that gets shared every time you get a new badge or something that made people want to visit the site perhaps you could survive.

You should just let him know that you're interested in working on a cryptocurrency project for fun, maybe he has interest in the concept of bitcoin as well. You never know, and even if he is old money, it doesn't have to ruin your professional relationships.

Yes, work with other people and just use your phone. Sure working at a bank is going to be a full time job but it's not going take up all your time. Plenty of people gain mastery in their hobbies while maintaining full time jobs. I don't see why you wouldn't be able to with our current technology and working with other people.

It's all good, I think it's a great concept

Exactly, when the influx of new users calms down we can finally start
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:02:03
Why not both?

My point was that actions speak louder than giving money to 'charities'. It also makes us look like we have something to hide/be guilty for.
I just think making it respectable by spending it within/creating respectable businesses and gaining trust from the likes of Tiger Direct and whatnot, is much better than squandering our money for a publicity stunt
