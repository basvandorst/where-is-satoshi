I'm not emotionally damaged by downvotes.  I just often like to understand WHY someone doesn't like something that seems inherently well written and useful.  :)

Actually... now that I have your attention...  can you explain to me how this works?
I just looked and see that your transaction is similar to the first one. 
You sent me a little and also sent a bunch more somewhere else. 
How do you do that?  Do you set them up together and then send them as a batch?
Does the blockchain take care of that for you?
I thought I had a pretty good handle on how it all works but since I’ve never actually done a transaction I didn’t realize there was more to it than entering an amount, an address, and guessing at an appropriate fee that would get it picked up.

Interesting that someone downvoted you. It would be nice to have an explanation for that. 
Thanks a ton for the info!!

Lol!! Thanks friend!!
Before anyone else kicks in though...  please don’t. 
I do appreciate the sentiment but this was never about making bank. 
Definitely read my blog post for the amusement though. :)
It’s interesting that now that things have settled down that it’s actually more feasible to use it. There’s a pretty glaring scaleability problem there isn’t there?

Ah!! Could the change go to the same wallet the transaction came from if you wanted it to?
That brings up another interesting challenge though. 
If I wanted to give my gummy money to someone else, could I even do it?

Yeah. That many. :D
