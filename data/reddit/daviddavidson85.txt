Don't listen to him. 
Build a rig, mine with nice hash or similar service.
Whether you believe you'll make a ROI is up to you, but it isn't impossible. I'm getting $6/day off a single card desktop I just so happened to have.

Tbh, don't know. Is there something I'm missing that in that statement? My grasp of currency outside of euros, isk, pesos, and Barbados currency is lacking

I'm making $6 a day leaving my desktop running. Where is the profit not in that?

Apartment with flat rate electricity, even then only costs $.04

Wait real nigga hour, is their currency a basis of .01??

I'm not trying to administer a lesson lol

That's my thoughts exactly. I'm not getting rich here, but you know what? It pays for gas or groceries. I'm busy in college, why not put the PC to use?

Just make your $8-10 a day and tell anyone else who tells you otherwise to piss off tbh.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:59:43
But I don't want to? What's your point again?

This isn't a racially charged post, just don't trust the Chinese in any sort of business transaction. My buddy grew up in Shanghai and has taught me to never trust them for one second. If they see a weakness in you, it will be exploited. 
Pls no autoban, it's the truth

I just got back from Iceland. Never once have I ever witnessed such a numerically dysfunctional currency. 
100 isk for yogurt
1600 for a shirt
As someone from a country with a currency that makes sense, it was very confusing. I don't know why they just don't internally force their currency to be normal.

100% pay a CPA, maybe even one that specializes in the investment side of accounting and managing that. You do not want one who does taxes for the average person because you will be paying for his time to brush up on the concepts and ideas around this.
Find someone experienced in investments (currency investments).

I understand your logic, but there is money to be made mining. Not terrific amounts, but a couple grand a year in BTC.

I just found the currency to be bizarre. The fact that 1 usd = 100 isk, and yogurt costing 126 felt bizarre is all. I think any normal human can acknowledge that a 500 isk hotdog feels weird

Cultural differences. No inherent shame. Shame if caught, acceptable if you get away with scamming.

Be sure to ask your CPA/tax preparer the exact concerns relative to BTC transactions.
I'm a little too fresh in audit to know the accounting principles, but I'd wonder how to address 2 situations.
1. Gain on sale over the sale exchange due to an increase in value of BTC
2. Loss on sale over the sale exchange due to an decrease in value of BTC 
I might be over thinking this, but it doesn't hurt to be fully aware before entering into it.
