Why even ask for money? Who's going to pay it? What proof do they have the hack was real.

Yeah they got caught installing adware by bundling popular software like gimp and notepad++

When you need to obfuscate your code to hide whats inside its a huge red flag. It would be like ordering a sandwich from a deli but the sandwich maker tells you not to look inside the sandwich.

I have hade many problems with cex.io's support. They wouldn't verify my ID or tell me why it wouldn't verify. Use GDAX, it's better IMO

Oh hey look I was right :&gt;

I had to boost my tx fees recently because my transactions wouldn't stop getting stuck. Try abandoning transaction and resending.

That's a bad thing, BBT always butchers nerd culture when it talks about it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:56:49
Not very, it dipped like $800 whoopdie doo. I remember just half a year ago when it was $2000 a BTC, now its $7000.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:18:50


What's that even mean? Is this a possible way for attackers to DoS out Tether by sending everyone 0.001 mbtc? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:31:42

@_date: 2016-09-27 20:28:55

@_date: 2017-10-29 18:20:37
It's almost like you don't get the joke lol
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:40:24

@_date: 2019-09-15 22:32:14

@_date: 2016-10-13 00:39:41
Why is WF getting involved in BTC? Don't they know you can't fake transactions?

Good Boy Points can only be used to buy chicken tendies unless your mom is willing to exchange GBP for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:39:18
