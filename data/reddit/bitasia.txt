Hi Glen - 
You can remit directly from coins.ph to any of 30 bank accounts in the Philippines, 22,000+ cash pick up locations,and 450 ATMs (no card needed, your beneficiary will receive a pin code to enter at the ATM).  
Alternatively, you can send them the funds directly with coins.ph (it's free), by clicking "send", and entering you'r recipients phone  email, or facebook name.  We then send them a message with instructions on how to sign up and they can withdraw the funds using any of our cash-out methods.

This is one place where light regulation can actually help legitimize Bitcoin - by sorting out the credible parties from the bad guys.
@_date: 2014-10-15 11:06:34
Ron from coins.ph here.  Most of our orders are delivered in cash (either retail location pickup or door-to-door delivery). likewise, many banks here don't have 24 hrs online money transfer capabilities.  Hence, our guarantee is next business day, but in fact very often we delivery same day. (Under promise, over deliver). 
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:16:55
Good effort - but might be a good idea to disclose you are keeping some of the money on each of the these donations.
update 1: here is the image -   (.7% discrepency).   
update 2: and the company since reached out to inform that this was a mistake, and it is meant to be 0%.

Thanks, bit_moon for sharing!
@_date: 2014-07-07 13:14:06
Just for clarity, I am with coins.ph, and we definitely did not post that.  you can see previous comments from our account, I've been pretty clear about my affiliation everywhere I post, especially when referencing own company.
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:34:38
Thanks Ray - absolutely agree. The competition here is not another Bitcoin company, but the incumbent players - and more so, the fact that 99.99% of OWFs know nothing about bitcoin in the first place, and it will take time for them to built trust.
public bashing doesn't move us forward on any of these goals.
@_date: 2014-11-19 10:49:14
Thanks deepy - great feedback.  We've actually cleaned up our verification process quite a bit (single form for ID Verification), but the ID upload is still a requirement. This is not up to us, but has to do with Philippines KYC/AML regulations - every field we collect is a requirement of BSP.

 (disclosure, i am the founder) locks the price at the time you place your order, guaranteeing that you get the price you were quoted, regardless of volatility. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:44:29
Hi Tanq - you may be confusing us with another exchange.  Coins.ph actually locks the sell price at the time you place your order, and we hold that price for 90 minutes.  We take on the fluctuation risk ourselves, even if we end up on the short end - we have a lot of customers that can confirm that.  As far as pricing, we are typically 1-2% above Bitstamp, reflecting currency conversion costs and our costs of operating.
@_date: 2014-07-16 08:57:04
.7% difference - from your own rate - when i checked.
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:16:49
Thanks TanqPhil, and no worries. I am not sure what happened with buybitcoin.ph, they are usually good as well.

I am staying classy. factual commenting, vs. name calling.

Thanks Stuffminer (this is ron)!  and yes, completely agree - to most people, we represent Bitcoin, and people will look to see how we perform to gauge if Bitcoin is a legitimate vehicle for sending money. that is a big responsibility. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 06:19:48
you are soliciting donations from the reddit community. would be better if you addressed my points than make personal attacks. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 07:59:42
When i checked it was over 0.5%, but, in any case, this is a pretty reasonable explanation, thanks for clarifying. much better than the personal attacks by your teammates on the rest of this reddit.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:55:06
how short do you think our memory is? you posted two comments above saying you are *with* the company.
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:06:25
Just to add -
 also offers the same service ( but doesn't charge the 3% rebit takes (and our exchange rate is very close with bitstamp)
We also have 6 months of operating experience converting Bitcoin into pesos and delivering money in the Philippines, and offer far more payout options.   
More options is good though - will drive prices down and benefit OFWs.
@_date: 2014-11-22 08:21:12
I second that. If you are not planning to use/sell your Bitcoin anytime soon, keeping it offline and somewhere secure is probably a good idea. 
Perhaps a hard copy stored in a secure safe, with a backup stored at another secure safe in a second location (in case of fire or flood). 
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:16:25
good hunch -  - the send money product is not live yet, but you can place a sell order and pick the most convenient payout method.

thank you!

What are the most exciting applications for a Twilio style API for sending money?
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:40:39
To clarify, ATM withdrawals are instant, bank deposits take up to 8 business hours (usually faster, but we'd rather under-promise/over-deliver). The delay is because of the way the banking system is wired here, we would love to make it instant.  BTW, as a comparison, US Based Coinbase takes 2-4 business days on any withdrawal. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:46:48
But I do agree there are options, aside from  (which we operate), there are other great exchanges here, most notably: buybitcoin.ph and coinxchange.ph

Thanks for the review, and glad that [coins.ph]( has been useful for you. 
we have higher limits (up to 20btc/day) for verified accounts, and can increase that further for high volume customers on a case by case basis. This is mostly driven by KYC/AML requirements.

Ron from coins.ph here, thanks for using us!
Wanted to chime in and echo If you are serious about Bitcoin, it's a good idea to experiment with setting up your own wallet, it's a good learning experience.  
There are pros and cons to managing the security of your private keys yourself (much has been written), but, if you are using a hosted service, it's a good idea to make sure the team/company behind the wallet is credible, follows best practices for security, and values their own reputation. These dats,  reputable wallet companies (coins.ph included) only keep a small fraction of the Bitcoin stored online, btw. The majority is stored offline in "cold storage". 
I personally use a combination (for my own bitcoin). large amounts stored offline, and smaller amount for day to day use in my coins.ph wallet where it is much more convenient to use (load my phone, buy things, send Bitcoin to friends via email, etc.)
Given that we operate an exchange, I can not really give advice on investment vs. holding, but, as far as using, there is a growing number of places where you can use Bitcoin.  we use it inside the office to pay each other back for coffee/food.  Much more convenient than cash and no need to deal with small change. I also use it to top up my phone so no longer need to run to Ministop everytime Smart eats up my load when my data plan expires :). 
@_date: 2015-05-23 14:44:39
Just goes to show that currency or technology are irrelevant - what matters is the transparency and the integrity of the parties transacting. 
It won't be long before the central banks are requesting banks to transact on open, audit-able ledgers.
@_date: 2015-01-12 13:43:48
As far as cash out option, we offer [24/7 instant cash withdrawals]( at 450 ATMs (no card needed!). We also deposit into 24 major banks, send cash via Cebuana, M Lhullier, Palawan, LBC, GCash, Smart money, and door-2-door delivery.

Congrats Jonathan and Team, we're excited to be your partner!
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:03:42
It's one of those things where the regulators can't slap too hard - after all these institutions are still central to the economy.  I think the more important thing to take away from here is that even under regulation, and with very credible institutions, there is the possibility of manipulation and corruption. 
Assuming the central banks are not happy with this, it would serve them to promote more open ledgers where the public can have better visibility to what is going on.
@_date: 2015-01-12 13:39:59
Thanks Rockhopper.  OP - i'm with coins.ph, we have a lot of filipino customer remitting from Korea already, would love to help out. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 05:31:26
Hi Jerry - you can learn more [about us] ( [here]( and [here](    
As far as rates - we want to keep things realistic as far as what Bitcoin can bring to the table, and not create false short-term expectation that Bitcoin remittances are cost free.  They are just cheaper. Hence we are not subsidizing the transaction - our rates are long term sustainable, and include all the transaction costs (including hedging against fluctuation, liquidity costs, etc.) - less than 1%.

There are quite a few advantages:
- lower fees and more flexiblity.  no large fixed fee  = people can send smaller amounts when they need it.
- 24/7 ATM Pickup (no card needed), even WU doesn't work these hours :). 
- far more options to receive cash (30+ banks, 5000 retails locations &amp; padala centers, cardless ATM pickup, door to door delivery, and more..)
- can use the funds directly to pay bills, top up phone, e-commerce payments, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:22:30
 Ledger good as well.  I don't have stake in either companies :). 
 I prefer Hardware wallets though since setting up and maintaining a proper air-gapped machine is quite involved, even for someone who is fairly tech savvy - too many places for things to go wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:08:15
Hi FunkyMaloneBTC, this is ron, from Coins.ph.   Like others, we are still monitoring the situation to understand exactly how the 2x upgrade will take place. There are still quite a few unknowns, as the debate is still taking place on the various dev mailing lists on the exact details of how and what will happened with the upgrade.  You can expect that we will make a more concrete statement on how we plan to handle the 2x fork prior to the  fork, once there is more clarity on the technical details. it's just too early to call right now.

@_date: 2017-10-09 15:16:20
just to clarify, Coins.ph is much more of a wallet than an exchange.  
If you hold a large amount of bitcoin, keeping it offline gives you maximum control.  Trezor is a good choice for that.   Downside of control is unless you are tech savvy, there are quite a few places where things could go wrong and where security can be compromised, which might land you at a worse position than a hosted wallet.  If you are storing a large amount of funds however, investing in learning how to handle bitcoin securely is a good investment.  For a small amount, I prefer a hosted wallet where i can access my funds immediately, while knowing the majority of funds are backed by cold storage.

I'm with coins.ph - you can use our APIs to convert BTC to CASH, we deliver to all major Banks in Philippines &amp; Thailand, 5000+ retail locations, door-to-door, and mobile money.

for coins.ph (philippines), our Cardless ATM withdrawals are instant, (24/7).  I'll let my colleagues at coins.co.th follow up for exact delivery time in Thailand, typically pretty fast as well though.
@_date: 2015-04-29 02:25:08
we like to under-promise/over-deliver.  We typically process bank withdrawals within a few hours (but guarantee next day).  The ATM withdrawals are instant!

Hey there, this is ron from coins.ph, just wanted to thank you for your kind words :). 
@_date: 2015-04-27 09:28:13
 - how was the effective exchange rate / ATM fee as compared to a regular ATM withdrawal with a foreign card?
@_date: 2015-04-28 00:52:16
Our limits tier up to 20 BTC per day once you've completed KYC. You can also check coins.ph for tighter spreads (sister companies, but the market conditions in PH allow for more efficient pricing).  Prices are still a bit above bitstamp spot rate, but not as much and the buy process is faster since you can do cash deposits at major banks.
@_date: 2015-04-28 00:52:32
localbitcoin is also a good option.
