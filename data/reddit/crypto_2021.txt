The value &amp; beauty of Bitcoin is almost alway explained to you by some weirdo who you don't respect to teach you about the value of money... I am that weirdo.

Sauce please. When was this posted? Can't find it.
@_date: 2019-01-21 09:24:50
I also want to know this.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:12:14
Yes, please tell us how that worked for you?

This is the real deal comment on this thread. Fucking long term thinking plebs. Get a sense of humour normies!

Then you’ll be surprised to know that “Real Dan” is 37.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:03:43
That’s factually incorrect. Dan bought in late 2016 &amp; early 2017, so he’s still pretty stoked.
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:43:54
Every little bit helps ;)
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:04:40
Yup, for realz.

Nah, this is nice and funny. Memes don’t control the world. Sorry you’re upset by it. I can relate for sure. The derp HODL memes hurt these days LOL. Strong hands my friends strong hands.

This is a very bad song &amp; video. I guess keep working on it...?
