Yeah, it's terrible advice to buy low and sell high... Who does that? What a crock.

That's how you do it! Buy low, sell high! If the crypto markets ever "normalize" then we can start looking at playing it for long-term gains with small investments over time. However, right now, take those earnings and re-invest when the market goes back down which it is likely to do over the next few months.

I'm not freaking out yet... I'm going to wait until I have a better feel for which direction it will continue to go in.

I've never understood the faith that history will always repeat itself.  Besides looking at trends there are so many other factors in the market.  Don't pin your hopes on the fact that X did the same thing 2 years ago.

Buy low and sell high!  I sold at 13k after buying at 3k, and that's just one way to make money. Of course it could rebound over the next week and go well above 13k who knows.  For me, I want it to go back down to 3k so I can invest again. It may not go down that far, and if it hits bottom at 5k, for example, then I'm in and investing. If you want to be smarter, then invest month after month and ride out the lows and highs over the long term, but really we don't know that bitcoin is going to continue to go up over the next decade as it could be over-valued right now, and that's why you don't see many taking that strategy.  My 2 cents. With volatility the way it is it isn't hard timing the market because you're never going to get a 400% increase in the stock market over 8 months, and I just did it with Bitcoin. History may not repeat itself though and you always have to keep that in mind.

Don't need to predict. I very comfortably sold at 400% and made a lot of money. I was patient though and watched the market many times a day and kept my ear to the rail as to what's going on with BitCoin.

I cashed it all out when it was above 13k. I saw a downward trend and pulled the trigger. At this point I'm wanting it to go back down to 3k so I can invest again and start the cycle over.

Somebody just turned in a bunch of coin... 1k+ drop in a just a few minutes.

Buy low, sell high.  If you bought whilst it was at a low say between 3-5k, then sell now if you already haven't.  My recommendation is to not get greedy.
However, if you are in the boat of people who bought closer to 13k, then you will just have to wait for it.
