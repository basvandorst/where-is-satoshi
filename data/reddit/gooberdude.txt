Been out of the game for a few years, so didn't have any BTC on coinbase during the Bcash fork. Can you explain what happened? From your comment it sounds like Coinbase is holding the bcash that owners of real bitcoin were entitled to. Is all that bcash still in people's accounts, just unable to be traded/moved?

Yea, it would add a LOT more volatility to the crypto world if the creator of the technology himself got back into the space and started taking stances on Bitcoin and alts after the community has come to rely on proxy leaders instead. His *forum posts* could literally cause billion dollar shifts in capital between btc/alts/fiat.

Well thanks for giving me some more info about this muddy truth. Coinbase is basically my most trusted crypto-facing organization at this point. Maybe that should change.

If core can't get together and make a functional currency then "I'm neither" as well. 
I'll take my capital to other, more functional cryptos and I don't understand why all bitcoiners seem to be OK with this paralysis of what was (to me) the original sell of Bitcoin (little to no transactional costs/friction in the space).

Wow seriously? Also thank you for responding. Yea you're right I got the the gist of it from your first comment and I asked you for confirmation because holy cow, that seems pretty shady. Why aren't more people speaking up. I don't even have a stake in this Bcash and it sounds fucked.

The new crypto elite have to at least partially cash out to give them fiat to pursue further ventures, I imagine. 
I just want everyone to sit back and realize that a large class of crypto believers across the entire planet have become beyond set for life, and now have sufficient capital to start trying to influence the politics around crypto in their home countries. 
I *want* them to cash out at least a little bit so they can start throwing that influence around.

Absolutely would not be free. A malevolent attack using those coins would obviously raise worries about whether he could threaten Bitcoin Core the same way if he ever came to disagree with the devs or really found any reason to unload one day. 
BCH would just fork to remove those coins and turn around and start selling their newfound resistance to this "Satoshi-dump attack" as another benefit their blockchain has over Bitcoin Core.

Allow me to posit to you that the next time you find something you've "analyzed" this intensely it makes sense that you go back and doublecheck your assumptions. Including the one that you accurately even read what you're talking about. It's clear from the article **you're** confusing their comments on the larger, complete $2.2B pool of assets in management for the small 152MM fund that is actually 50% in BTC. You literally posted several paras of analysis about something the article never implied and now 20 people in this sub have upvoted you probably also not having really read the article and thinking this comment has a hint of truth in it.
Bitcoiners think about the consequences your actions can take before you post half-baked comments like this.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:34:09
I think Satoshi also has a decent case to want to move some of those coins to crypto supporting agencies to help fund development and outreach. If he made a post from one of his accounts that said he was going to burn 70-90% of his coin and use the remaining coin to support Bitcoin development and proceeded to verifiably do so it could be positive.
Very specific scenario though of course.

Last thing I read on this topic, Andreas said he sold all his btc to support his family years ago. I think it was a direct twitter response to Roger's tweet if you want to see it.
Edit, here's what Andreas said: 
"I did invest, Roger. Then I sold in 2013 to pay my rent. I didn't have disposable income to work for two years without pay and invest at the same time. I should've gone into more debt, but that would have been irresponsible towards my family who I supported"

I think the innovation that Dogecoin brings is the community feel and accessibility to those new to cryptocurrencies. Judging from the tone of your own comment and several others in this and other r/Bitcoin threads, do you guys really think that comes off as a friendly and charming place to outsiders?
I get that you've been dealing with the same questions over and over for years now, but guess what, when someone is new to something they ask questions. Telling them to fucking Google it, or read the damn sidebar, as justified as it may feel to you, is just off putting. 
has hit 30,000 subscribers in under 2 months. The community has come together to create more services and infrastructure for the coin in that time than most other altcoins get in their entire lifespans. Average people look at a phenomenon they can't explain and quickly write it off as stupid. The smarter and more curious get over themselves and start trying to understand it.

Man, the problem I have with all this thinking is that everyone assumes from the very start that Satoshi was just as paranoid on the day he published the white paper as he was once Bitcoin actually took off. 
When it started, Satoshi sent a paper with some very well thought ideas he had to a freaking mailing list. Everyone's acting like he already knew back then for a fact that Bitcoin would be worth 8 Billion+ in 2014 and the entire world would be looking for him, and made sure to cover his tracks with that in mind. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:49:30

Tell a newbie about it and set them up to mine with the GPU they already own.
But fairly, not much yet. Dogecoin is two months old. No one is arguing that Dogecoin is now, or will ever be a replacement for Bitcoin. 
What Dogecoin is, is fun, accessible, highly liquid, and much more evenly distributed than Bitcoin, Litecoin, or any other coin (Top 100 addresses own ~38% of Dogecoin, compared to easily 50%+ for nearly every other coin). 
The community is more tightly knit, less profit focused (for now), and growing at a remarkable pace. 30,000 subscribers in two months alone. Dogecoin is the doorway for the uninitiated to become acquainted with crpytos. Dogecoin does not yet have huge dedicated ASIC compounds, investment funds, sophisticated speculators, and many other things that can intimidate and complicate things for those just getting into the space.
Dogecoin resembles Bitcoin when it was just getting 
started. Probably the Bitcoin that many of you earlier investors remember most fondly. Dogecoin is that, for those of us didn't get into Bitcoin before it grew out of reach for the ordinary person. As a newbie, my options in Bitcoin are 1) Buy some Bitcoin and 2) There are no other options. With DOGE I can 1) Mine with my current card 2) Invest in a mining rig 3) Tip freely in the community with non fractional amounts of coin 4) Have a good time in the subreddit because it's still fun and not overly serious. 5) Develop goods and services for Dogecoin because the space is still wide open. Consider that.
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:25:41
I don't get why people focus on the value of a single DOGE when that's practically irrelevant. The market cap of dogecoin has grown to 20 million USD+. Dogecoin may be worth a fraction of a penny each, but people hold millions and millions of them. It's like arguing a company is worth half as much as before if they have a stock split and their per share price goes from $50 to $25. The per unit price is meaningless when taken out of context of the total number of units.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:38:43
Sorry you feel that way, it's true a lot of us in the Dogecoin community hope the value goes up and we all make a profit, but not in a pump and dump scenario, in a Dogecoin gains wide acceptance kind of scenario. I can't say for certain but I do feel like the kind of people you're referring to make up a small minority of our community. But it's fair to despise those that are like that. 
Same, I'm always happy to discuss Dogecoin. No hard feelings lol.

@_date: 2014-03-17 21:53:58
An actual rig can mine anywhere from $10-20 a day. Well closer to 10 now, before the halving and price decline it was easy to get nearly 25+ some days.
Check out r/dogecoinmining, it's just as active if not more so than r/litecoinmining. People are profitably mining large amounts of Doge everyday! But yes, fair point for the average single GPU miner.
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:45:08
You are now claiming I said Dogecoins are good for not much really? When we had several back and forth comments making it clear it was the answer to the question "What can you do with Dogecoins that you can't do with Bitcoins"? Really?
I'm tired of this so I'm just gonna bold things in your comment that you claim that I avoid, or hide from saying that I've actually just explicitly said, Italicize things that you claim I've said that I haven't. All future responses from me will be like this, but that's fine, because you seem quite adept at having conversations and full blown discussions between yourself and an imaginary opponent.
You're acting like an ass and I know you're probably smart enough to realize it. You're in too deep though and you've becoming too invested in this argument to let it go. So here goes, after this I'm done, feel free to write this up as another brilliant victory in your book. I'm sure your ego will appreciate this.
"You are right, I have not carefully re-read your comment before replying again.
So we agree then? You say Dogecoin is great because it lacks the seriousness associated with today's Bitcoin, which is mainly due to Bitcoins relatively high value. *That makes Dogecoin so very fun because nobody needs to worry about the money aspect of it because it is essentially worthless, and it's all totally not serious and everything is wide open.* Is that accurate enough?
And yet people like you "invest" in mining rigs to mine and SELL dogecoins to *people who get told that they need to "diversify their crypto-portfolio" or whatever stupid snakesoil salesman pitch that gets used. How very fun and not serious at all!*
*People like you hide behind the "it's not srsbsnss guise, just fun! to tha moon! buy now! such meme!"* facade to take advantage of gullible people who think they have somehow missed the train with Bitcoin and don't want to miss "the next big thing".* And don't tell me you're just doing that for fun too.* **You pay money for a mining rig and you expect to make a profit.** *Even though you admit that Dogecoins are good for not much yet really.*
But hey, at least you are distributing those coins!

That they can't do many things that Bitcoin can't do yet =/= not being "good" for much really. They are still useful as a medium of exchange and introduction into the cryptocurrency world. They are actually great at spreading the idea to uninitiated people, and the friendly, open, and rapidly growing community is proof of that. Dogecoin is two months old so it can't do more than Bitcoin can YET, but give it a year and let's see. 
The italics are to show you are arguing against ideas and positions I never took, perhaps others in this thread did, but why use them in a response to me? Doesn't make sense. 
And yes I invested in a mining rig, that's why I put that part in bold. Bold represents the things you presume I tried to hide, but never did. See point number 2) for dogecoin in my first reply to the original commenter.
And finally, what am I denying. Tell me outright explicitly what I am denying and make sure you've read my posts this time so I don't waste time having to backtrack and point them out to you again for a third time. I'm not attacking you on a personal level, I'm attacking your actions in this thread. "You are acting like an ass" is not the same as "You are an ass". I'm judging your behavior that I've personally witnessed. I have no idea who you are and what you're like otherwise, so of course I have no basis to judge you as a person.

@_date: 2014-02-04 03:52:57
Your analogy would make sense if we lived in a world where cars were still shunned by the majority of the population and the general consensus was they were mere novelties that could never replace the tried and true horse and buggy system. The fact is neither DOGE nor BTC are anywhere close to being as accepted and mainstream as cars are. Maybe when every single household in most developed countries holds significant amounts of cyrpto's we can start worrying about "branding" issues like you bring up, but until then, all crypto is good crypto.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:03:01

@_date: 2014-03-07 09:08:15
Fair enough. Dorian graduated 40+ years ago for what it's worth, I wonder if was the crypto landscape was necessarily the same back then. Agreed that it's not enough evidence. Combined with his history of distrusting the government and several year "blank" period right around the time of Bitcoin's development, I'm still left wondering though.
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:37:00

Um his 30+ year career as a software engineer that included secret work in both government and private agencies also brings some relevance, especially when combined with a lifelong history of distrusting the government and trying to teach his kids to do the same:
1. "Just after graduating college, Nakamoto went to work on defense and electronics communications for Hughes Aircraft in southern California"
2. "and next worked for Radio Corporation of America in Camden, N.J., as a systems engineer."
3. "We were doing defensive electronics and communications for the military, government aircraft and warships, but it was classified and I can't really talk about it," confirms David Micha, president of the company now called L-3 Communications."
4. "Mitchell says her husband "did not talk much about his work" and sometimes took on military projects independent of RCA."
5. "Nakamoto worked as a computer engineer for communications and technologies companies in the Los Angeles area, including financial information service Quotron Systems Inc., sold in 1994 to Reuters, and Nortel Networks."
6. "...moved back to New Jersey with their five children and Nakamoto worked as a software engineer for the Federal Aviation Administration in New Jersey in the wake of the September 11 attacks, doing security and communications work, says Mitchell. "It was very secret," she says."

Not essentially, explicitly. I said straight up: "Dogecoin resembles Bitcoin when it was just getting started." I never tried to avoid saying this way, don't know where you got that from. Once again representing my comments inaccurately and tilting at windmills. 
And what assumptions? These figures are taken from the analysis of a citigroup analyst, who's quotes you can read for yourself in this article: 
And it's a sidenote in your comment, but a main factor for me, I'm the one that brought it up because it's a real concern of mine. 
And as as for avoiding the "What can you do with Dogecoin that you can't do with Bitcoin?" question: I said in my very first comment here, and then pointed out again in a reply, "Not much yet really". Here I'll put in bold for you so you don't miss it again: **Not much yet really**. Where is the avoidance? That's a direct answer. And it's the same answer you're pretending I'm afraid to say. Keep willfully ignoring my answers. I can't wait to see what you come with next.

lol there are a lot people with large amounts of money in Dogecoin. Same guy just tipped $5300 in Doge earlier today:
@_date: 2014-01-19 23:15:00
That was one part of my answer yes. But other big points for me was the more even distribution, greater number of small transactions, tightly knit and less profit-driven (for now) community, and ease of adoption for new users. I guess that might not matter for your serious market, but Dogecoin's always been more about getting new people into cryptos for the first time. Browse for a bit and your bound to find "Wow, I just heard about dogecoin and now I'm mining!" threads. Keep your serious market, and we'll do the work spreading cryptocoins to the uninitiated market. Maybe you feel that's "useless", but we sure as hell don't.

Although the price of BTC measured in USD is non-valuable information. You see no hypocrisy in this?
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:18:33
Stocks aren't meant to be used as currency though. People are used to price stability for the products they buy and use day to day. It doesn't really do anything to address the real issue to just insult the non-crypto initiated when they bring up legitimate points. The volatility of cryptos IS an issue we have to address going forward as we try to get wider adoption.
Or we can just keep insulting people and see how that pans out.
@_date: 2014-01-20 01:48:10
Greater adoption by a wider and more diverse userbase = more utility, more likelihood of broader adoption and use than Bitcoin. That is what I meant by wait a year and let's see, will more people be using Dogecoin for transactions and purchases? Or will they be using Bitcoin? Or will some use bitcoin as a store of value akin to gold, while using Dogecoin as a functional currency akin to USD. Widespread adoption and use IS a utility that Dogecoin has a chance of achieving in the future. That has nothing to do with technical standards, which can change and improvements in which can be adopted to the protocol as needed. 
If you don't believe that, that's fine, but don't malign everyone who does as liars trying to make a quick buck. If I didn't believe in the potential of Dogecoin I wouldn't have invested well over $1000+ for a mining rig on top what I already invested (a lot) in outright purchases. Who am I taking of advantage of exactly? Myself?
The community isn't all fun and flowers, and no one is claiming that it is. But as of now it is MORE fun and less intimidating than @_date: 2014-04-03 18:02:52
I'm generally against crossposting links to and having a mob of them inevitably come over and up/downvote r/bitcoin's posts. But in this case, wtf did you expect?
Also 1) That's not how 51% attacks work, you can't create coins out of nowhere or steal coins that don't belong to you and 2) Bitcoin miners are all running SHA256 ASICs and have nowhere near the Scrypt mining capacity to attack Scrypt based coins.
@_date: 2014-01-19 23:29:55
More even distribution has nothing to do with Dogecoin being worth less, or at an earlier stage of its development than Bitcoin. Satoshi's wallet contains ~10% of all Bitocoin, the top 47 people together hold ~30% of all Bitcoins, and the top 947 people taken together hold ~50% of all Bitcoins. Half of Bitcoin's $10 Billion market cap is owned by under 1000 people, or 1/10 of 1% of Bitcoin holders.
You can keep inaccurately boiling down my points to whatever conclusion you find easiest to refute, but that doesn't change the reality of the situation.

Dunno why we're all assuming pre-Bitcoin Satoshi was just as paranoid and diligent as he was once it actually took off. Not like he knew for a fact it would grow to $8 billion+ and the entire world would be looking for him come 2014. When it started, all he was doing was submitting a paper to a freaking mailing list. And at the time of the white paper's submission, Dorian hadn't gone by the name Satoshi Nakamoto for decades.

I'll direct your attention to when I said "Not much really". And my first sentence. You can't GPU mine Bitcoin profitably, and it's going to be a hard sell to convince a newbie to invest in an ASIC. 
Regardless, I gave you a well thought out answer that actually took a bit of thinking and writing to bring to you. But you seem more worried about winning an argument than actually getting any answers or understanding what's driving us Dogecoiners. I'm done with this.

I don't blame you if you haven't been paying close attention, but Dogecoin is currently at 47+ Gh/s, compared to Litecoin's 107 Gh/s, making it easily the second highest of all scrypt based coins. The Th/s of protection Bitcoin isn't comparable because it's in a different algo. 
It's not like attackers running SHA256 ASICs can jump onto the Dogecoin network and execute an attack. And how secure are Bitcoin's 14,000+ Th/s of hashing power really when a single sketchy mining pool regularly encroaches upon that 50% mark?

Then why does the price fall of Bitcoin not matter?

I think the problem is miners within multipools gaining access to ASICs ups the total proportion of daily Doge/LTC/any scryptcoin being immediately sold for BTC. Imagine a BTC mining pool that sold all its mined BTC daily for USD jumping from 20% of your network hashrate to 50%.

Alright, so based on what you're saying, we can definitely say for sure that Dorian Nakamoto never worked with cryptography and complex data structures in a 40+ year career of secret work with government and defense agencies? I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying everyone's patting themselves on the back and acting so completely certain, but what we know so far still leaves me with some doubt.

Gotta hand it to you, you're right. The post was specifically asking about opinion.

That's odd because Overstock.com just started accepting them last month. So what you're actually saying is "I'll pay attention to Dogecoin when they accomplish what we've just recently done", ignoring the fact of course that for the 4-5 years you've been following Bitcoin it wasn't accepted by Overstock. Doesn't really make sense to me, but maybe to you I guess.

Fair points, but Dogecoin is also still in it's infancy and more maleable technically than Bitcoin. It has less intertia and capital behind it that would gawk at the thought of implementing technical changes to the protocol. You said yourself that you'd consider leaving Bitcoin once Zerocoin comes out. Dogecoin might (not definitely, but might) be able to incorporate key technical changes into itself without the need of spawning a new coin.

Maybe this is part of why no one can log into Coinbase right now..
