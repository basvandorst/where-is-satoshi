Once everyone uses bitcoin this feature will be pointless. Just don't be the first guy in or the last guy out. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:32:52
Direct deposit doesn't cut out the middle man (banks). With bitcoin, its essentially the same as your boss handing you cash
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:29:15
Own word. Smart
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:44:22
You clearly are uninformed about Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:32:12
Might make coinbase my primary Bitcoin wallet again
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:39:02
They assume that everyone is a terrorist and we are all guilty till proven innocent. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:33:50
You're right. Bitcoin is even more of a technological advancement than automobiles. But that's not the point.
@_date: 2014-11-19 15:24:23
I tip what I can, even if it's a few cents worth. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:18:26
Since there are smarter people on here than I.... What if you use a linux live usb? Wouldn't it be harder for an attacker to...attack you?
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:27:40
Had received my first tip the other day, it was a quite simple experience They tipped me a beer ~$3.50. That beer was the best beer I've ever had.
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:33:25
Well stated. For the most part I've been buying on the way down. I'm in Bitcoin for the long term anyways. Thanks
@_date: 2014-10-10 23:14:56
I'm programming a bitcoin app. Money helps
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:27:41
Was 300 a good time to invest? I believe it was can you confirm this with maybe more thoughts?
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:13:01
&lt;3 you
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:53:58
I may be losing money, no risk no reward right? I'm buying bitcoins to..invest in bitcoins, not quick profit.
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:38:28
I will donate!
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:17:30
They are cool! 100 bits for you! @_date: 2014-10-20 21:54:07
I like these documents.
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:49:42
Lets do it!
@_date: 2014-12-26 14:51:22
Probably all these companies will be internet based. Brick and mortar (currently) can't survive off only btc transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:43:02
Exactly! Cash and Fiat currencies are already being used for all these scenarios and even worse! Illicit activities will always exist. Not a fault in the currency a fault in the user. Even if theses issues exist, we cant compromise our own personal security for freedom, that trick never works.
@_date: 2014-11-16 02:32:26
I'll make a forum...for free
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:17:23
They should  ban cash, used more than digital currencies to fund terrorist activates...smh
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:30:11
Yea, bitcoins.. crazy right? 100 bits @_date: 2014-11-11 15:29:16

This is why I &lt;3 the Bitcoin community!
@_date: 2014-11-30 00:22:26
Buying anything with Bitcoin would be a loss..
@_date: 2014-12-05 05:16:47
Its so true... Guilty till proven innocent? Doesn't work like that. Privacy always come first.
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:20:13
Don't use any sites that store information attaching you to a bitcoin wallet/transaction. 
You submit a ton of information to sites like Coinbase.. And that's only because of the issues of converting bitcoins to fiat.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:13:27
I've been slowly buying more. The worst thing you can do when the price is down is sell. What are u losing anyways? I'm buying as it goes down and planning on holding them for a year.
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:43:48
?Wouldn't GAW miner be more profitable by using the "hardware" they sell for the hashlets to just..mine bitcoin themselves
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:42:51
I know right? How could they not ask for a photo when it's you!?
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:30:13
I'm buying all my gifts this season with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:58:07
Best way to get other involved in Bitcoin! Now to buy some Bitcoin merch...
@_date: 2014-11-27 21:05:59
Ken is just spreading trickle journalism. Bitcoins have already been declared as a legal currency. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 14:47:45
I believe it does, but not enough to compensate for the rate of transactions increasing...that's why the hard fork is needed
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:41:17
It can't exclude gift cards as they are the same thing to bitcoin, just suck 10x more and based on bs technology.
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:01:43
I believe after a while it cancels, how long tho..idk
@_date: 2014-12-29 00:16:23
Trezor or die.

They don't require a lot of info to become a sponsored listing. All you have to do is pay..

Tip Tuesday? I support! 
@_date: 2014-10-16 13:44:45
I'm new to posting, been lurking a while. Now that I have finances to start inventing in Bitcoin has sparked my participation on here.
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:41:27
Long game!
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:06:58
Every transaction you should use a new one, I agree with you!
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:30:39
He's saving bitcoin. He stabilized the currency. Reinvesting all the money he cashed in on, thus being able to keep the currency flat or grow. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:30:24
This is why I &lt;3 the Bitcoin community!
@_date: 2014-11-17 07:44:11
faf....fake as fuck
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:27:20
Attacking you rather than presenting facts to prove his point.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:36:18
Could you elaborate on HD wallets?
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:31:34
Yeah, I think this is how he has been represented before.
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:36:09
Glad you understand 100 bits @_date: 2014-11-30 02:52:33
You are correct. That is why the value is declining. Nobody has any reason to go out of their way to acquire Bitcoins. It is am investment. The price volatility deems it an investment
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:47:56
Money for being smart 100 bits @_date: 2014-12-04 01:35:05
I wanna hear what both sides have to say. I also want to see Ken Hess's logic shut down.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:01:05
price dip eh?
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:21:05
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:14:58
Uhh, this subreddit it about Bitcoins... So we are gonna discuss Bitcoins. But I do understand your point.
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:39:30
If it is known theft, I'm ok with this.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:28:48
What? 100 bits @_date: 2014-12-16 14:57:35
They wont do this because there isn't a face for the cover lol!
*btw, this is a joke.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:29:20
I've had a question for a while now and that is... Is BitPay negitivaly affecting the price of BTC as they immediately convert Bitcoins to fiat.. driving the price down right? BitPay should offer better options for merchants that want to hold those Bitcoins. Please correct me if I am wrong!
edit: My question is.. are there incentives offered by BitPay to encourage Bitcoin merchants to hold BTC rather than instantly selling for fiat?
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:21:46
100 bits welcome!
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:46:56
I don't understand the point of this BitLicense other than to invade your privacy. Bitcoin is designed to do exactly the opposite of what you guys are trying to do. How can you guys expect to accomplish this? Other than forking bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:50:05
This is correct. Bitcoin cannot function as a currency. Currently.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:42:01
3 step auth? lol
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:59:42
=D Thanks!

Today is the day then! 200 bits @_date: 2014-11-10 17:35:18
My question is.. are there incentives offered by BitPay to encourage Bitcoin merchants to hold BTC rather than instantly selling for fiat?
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:03:14
&lt;3 this crap. 100 bits for you! @_date: 2014-11-06 15:29:30

Dude you'll be so safe bro, FBI has got u don't worry! /s
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:54:28
Because Bitcoin needs no middleman, coinbase.. being that middleman
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:08:40
Let's do it
@_date: 2014-10-16 13:47:09
&lt;3 tor. The future of the net right there. I also support the idea of getting reimbursed in Bitcoin to incentivize nodes. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:57:53
Awesome idea! Here's some more for him! 200 bits @_date: 2014-11-13 00:15:42
I agree! 100 bits @_date: 2014-11-10 15:28:04
Great news for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:26:38
I just shared this to Facebook. You should all do the same. They can't stop us all...*evil laugh*

Here is some free ones! 100 bits @_date: 2014-10-17 03:21:12
Nobody would plan to become AOL lol
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:19:15
I'm not sure yet if this is a viable solution, but it sounds pretty good so far.
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:45:09
I've been stressing dynamic blocks for awhile now.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:16:37
Here's some bitcoins to find out! 100 bits for you! @_date: 2015-05-08 20:46:44
Being dynamic tho shouldn't it theoretically readjust post spam?
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:18:38
Lol, surprise! /s
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:44:46
Lets do it!
@_date: 2014-11-17 07:45:54
This is totally false. Check the source... their website..
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:34:45
This is very good news! People will have the choice to use this exchange but it is a necessary step!

He just don't get it. ;D
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:27:41
Woops, just dumped my life savings into Bitcoin.

I'm glad they are working hard. I believe in them.

Bitcoin is finally getting the press it deserves!
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:15:47
I think it's because when people speculate on the price, it turns into an argument on why it shouldn't be at that price, freaking people out and sell.
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:57:17
The market often responds on non-technical data, like fear or trust.
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:26:52
A news article on it maybe? 1 dead 4 trapped
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:24:44
Rather HODL

Unconfirmed transactions have dropped from 150k+ to about 90k right now.
If your transaction goes 3 days without confirmations it will return to the original wallet.

Yay Bitcoin going on sale, I'm buying more
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:41:02
Probably should sell all right now
@_date: 2015-09-03 22:34:37
Bitcoin doesn't need governing.

Waka Flocka Flame or Rand Paul
It's a hard choice.

Everytime someone makes a post about the price, it tanks.
