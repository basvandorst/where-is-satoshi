Ah ok thanks!

This shows how out of it I am. Last I heard, GPUs were the thing to use.

Says Bill Gates, the economist.

You'd think they would be since its utility is partly determined by block size and transaction times.
@_date: 2016-06-04 14:23:38
In totally missed that part. Hopefully there's no way to clone and flash it.
@_date: 2016-06-04 15:02:54
Is that a joke?
@_date: 2016-06-04 02:49:28
This seems cool, and I'm probably speaking from ignorance, but isn't the PIN for the Trezor device itself now the problem? If someone got a hold of it, a 4-6 digit PIN isn't going to do much.
@_date: 2016-06-04 14:23:54
Yeah I dunno.
Everyone was so worried about it.
@_date: 2016-06-04 06:40:12
Cool thanks.
@_date: 2016-06-04 06:06:05
Thanks for all your help.
@_date: 2016-06-04 14:24:57
Ah. How could it positively affect its utility?
@_date: 2016-11-09 07:41:16
I'm the parlance of our times what?
@_date: 2016-06-04 04:44:20
The joke is funny, but the block size limit was no problem when it was $900 dollars. That may not be relevant since I don't understand it perfectly, but why would it be a problem now when it's $500?
Edit: Clarification of what was funny.

Isn't bitcoin fiat too?
@_date: 2016-11-09 08:19:36
You might have a point, but here's where I got my idea.

Free coins?

It sounds like you'd need a court order or subpoena, or access to exchange data.
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:09:38
That's...not true. I work on these cases all the time.
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:40:46
Lol no we weren't we were talking about how to trace Bitcoin transactions and how in order to do so you need a court order, subpoena or access to exchange records. The claim was made that that's not true in the US, I said yes it is, then you came along and said Snowden had something to do with what we were talking about when he didn't.
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:42:33
The Smowden leaks showed nothing that I'm aware of regarding Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:53:24
How would you trace it?
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:26:16
Lol k
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:50:18
Again, you're using an example of something we're not talking about. This entire conversation has been about Bitcoin. You are the only one making it about anything else. However, I'll bite. The request the federal government made about Edward Snowden's email account at Lavabit was made under the Stored Communication Act. Then later they obtained a federal warrant from a judge to obtain private keys of all users. Lavabit rightly shut down instead of giving them up. No obvious due process issues though. It IS an arguable point in jurisprudence to say the least, which neither one of us are probably qualified to resolve.
Edit: sorry I mixed you up with another commenter.
@_date: 2019-09-04 01:27:42
That's not even close to what I did. You started making it about something that nobody else on this comment thread was talking about. That's all. Point to where anyone was talking about in the conversation I was having. You can't.
