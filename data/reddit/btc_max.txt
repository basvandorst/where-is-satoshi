Decentralized bitcoin tumbling is totally possible: 
If you disagree, there's 445 btc waiting for you to unmix.
Which shitcoin are you pumping?

There's far more important things to get done than informing some ignorant troll on twitter who only wants to sell his ebook. That moron pours scorn on us and then expects us to educate him.
Cypherpunks write code. You'll figure out the answers to those points when you download a LN wallet yourself.

Funny how a simple boycott has now become *"a gun to their heads"*. Miners have to do their jobs or else they won't be paid, it's as simple as that.
Why is it "justice" if the bitcoin maximalists lose? What do you have against people winning? You should try it some time. Go back to the loser rbtc sub.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:09:26
It's a beautiful thing when a completely peaceful boycott can force the hand of such an apparently-powerful group.
The only irresponsibility was when miners refused to signal for segwit and started with their bullshit Bitcoin Unlimited. Of course the economy isn't going to take that lying down. Where's your condemnation of the miners?
In fact, where were you when Mike Hearn was pushing for BitcoinXT? You were cheering him on I bet. Your post history shows contributions to rbtc so STFU with your crocodile tears of *"ooo it was so irresponsible"*. The pro-decentralization side won, now GTFO and go buy BCH tokens. (Of course I know you'll come crawling back to lovely Bitcoin because of superior technology and strong network effects)

they said it wouldnt go above $1

Aren't you the guy who created the javascript paper wallet pages that have lead to a massive explosion of unsafe practices like address reuse and handling raw private keys?
Aren't you a Monero speculator now? And big blocker as well?
Go back to counting your bcash, leave our bitcoin alone. We had a divorce now stop following us around and GTFO!

Lol you don't understand shit. Stop blacklisting addresses then you can talk. Go back to running your shitty casinos and exchanges, you think an idiot in a cheap suit can talk to our Luke-jr like that?
You call yourself a libertarian and then [open your legs to any government who asks]( Get lost you massive hypocrite.
The hard fork will not succeed, we will run our full nodes. The successful UASF has conclusively shown that hash power doesn't mean jack.

The way I see it, I'm involved in bitcoin not "cryptocurrencies".
If people want to scam each other with ICOs and premined shitcoins then that has nothing to do with bitcoin. So I don't see anything wrong with the authorities doing their thing.
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:15:51
It's a bit too late for that.
The work is backed by a registered company and the wallet itself connected to a centralized server, which can get taken down at the stroke of a bureaucrat’s pen just like Napster. I hope the situation improves but the wallet company wants to make income somehow and that requires centralization.
@_date: 2019-01-13 21:02:36
The issue isn't making money but being a central point of failure.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:07:05


So what? Visa processes even more.
Ethereum is so centralized that its developers were able to bail themselves out by forcing a hard fork to take back their lost coins. See for all the details.


You're not pro-BTC, you're a liar.
Competition is a good thing, but that requires us to talk about the flaws, deficiencies and outright dishonest practices from the ethereum developers.
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:55:53
He does, otherwise why would they wouldn't make a company.
I remember someone asking nopara about the backend server and he replied that releasing it open source would damage his eventual income stream. Which is OK, making money isn't a bad thing, but people should understand that it is a central point of failure like Napster.

Give me ONE example of a unique ethereum use case that exists today.
Ethereum has existed for 4 years already, when Bitcoin was 4 years old it already had a mature Silk Road ecosystem.

No they won't. Ethereum is a scam with no unique use cases. Litecoin is a bad copy of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:02:47
It's a centralized scam, see for just a taster of the nasty stuff its developers get up to.

I've been involved in bitcoin since 2013, and occasionally you see newbs doing stuff like this. It's the wrong strategy, here's why.


This makes you sound like you're in some weird religion.
Why would your customers want to accept something that you're sending away? Why would they want it when you apparently *dont* want it?
For something to be a method of value transfer, it needs to have value first.
See this blog post, it should explain everything:

Ethereum is so centralized that its developers were able to bail themselves out by forcing a hard fork to take back their lost coins.
See for all the details.
Litecoin is a copy and a scam. Litecoin's faster block times come at the cost of reduced centralization. Once we have LN transactions will be instant anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:01:10
Ethereum is an absolute scam.
XMR at least isn't a scam but it's technology is worse than bitcoin (Monero full nodes have much worse scalability properties and must store every TXO forever, soon enough Monero full nodes will be too difficult to run and then Monero will die)
The only reason bitcoin was not destroyed in the block size scalability drama was because full nodes were easy to run. Monero won't have that.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:05:15


This is not in use today. And anyway it's not unique to Ethereum, bitcoin could do the same.


Not a use-case. Mining doesn't exist independently of a cryptocurrency.


Not unique, bitcoin does this (bitsquare)


Not unique, bitcoin is used for donations too. Vastly more people accept bitcoin than ethereum for donations.

Let's go with Oleg Andreev's elaboration 
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:33:48
The Wasabi server can still sybil attack.
It can be ordered to watch for specific UTXOs and sybil attack them if they get registered for a coinjoin. The server would let the target coins be coinjoined only with UTXOs it owns, so it can easily unmix them but the user would think they did a genuine coinjoin. This only requires that the server operator owns about 0.1BTC x 60 = 6BTC (or a bit more) and those coins are not used up when doing this. How do you know this isn't already happening with your UTXOs? You don't, you have to trust them.
