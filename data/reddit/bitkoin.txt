Good idea. I will replace the coin with the alien holding the coin. I don't currently have access to that picture though.

@_date: 2013-03-15 17:48:36
Thank you, means a lot. :)

RES nightmode is a beast I can't control yet. Maybe someone can help me out.
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:09:20
You might be right, I will change it later.
@_date: 2013-03-16 09:04:58
I will get back to you when I have some time.

Look at this comment tree  Which one is more readable?
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:28:57
What would you like better, straight lines or no lines at all? My thinking was that posts become easier to seperate with the dotted lines. In addition, visited links get slighty greyed out. I will keep your feedback in mind.
@_date: 2013-03-16 09:03:15
I changed it. Do you like it better now?
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:26:44
Fun fact: The font I used is Ubuntu Bold Italic which is being used quite often to display the 'bitcoin' logo.

Hey guys, I'm still experimenting with different colors and options so things may break in the next few minutes. Keep the feedback coming.

I don't dig the yellow to be honest. Red might be too strong but it's supposed to direct people who never heard of Bitcoin and/or visit /r/ Bitcoin for the first time.

It's now on 'darkorange', what do you think?.Also what do you recommend for the submit buttons? Do you really think making one colored would create a bias? Both green wouldnt look good and leaving them grey would be monotone.
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:51:47
The lines have been removed. Thank you for your feedback.
@_date: 2013-03-16 15:40:39
I am working on the sidebar right now. Will do!
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:20:03
It's changed now. Basically, I can change the word "readers" into anything I want.
@_date: 2013-03-16 08:52:41
What resolution are you on? I will look into it.
@_date: 2013-03-16 08:57:02
The icon has been changed aswell as the background texture. Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2013-03-15 21:22:12
Link colors I fixed just before you wrote this comment. How do you like the yellow Bitcoin message? The icon would have to be fixed of course. The reason tabs are not seperated is because I hid the "controversial" tab this way. I believe it's not needed. What's your take? Bring it back?
@_date: 2013-03-16 08:53:56
I found it! Thanks for the heads up. Changed the header texture aswell. Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2013-03-15 20:08:12
Fair enough. I had fun making it so no hard feelings.
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:15:34
Because somebody just subscribed to that subreddit. It now has 2 subscribers. Thank you for the tip!
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:18:45
I am open to suggestions! :)
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:54:25
Dotted lines have been removed. I will add the alien back in as soon as I get access to the image (in a higher resolution). Thanks for the kind words.
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:58:51
I have read your comment and you make some good points. Give me some time to address them.
EDIT: You are right about community rules, I will use approach when I have some time.
I chose green (and red) to represent colors from the stock market. I used them sparingly on only places I thought were important. Arrows can be fixed, I went with the minimalist approach. RES nightmode is a nightmare. That's why I chose a grey background and a dark banner to make the site easier one the eyes. I might have to find another texture for the header as many people find it too dark but it supports my use of colors like green and red.

@_date: 2013-03-16 10:56:48
I eliminated green completely from my design. You were right again, orange fits better with the overall theme.

[nagdude]( is the creator. message him.

Thank you for the tip!

I used the coin you linked as a header at one point but found that it didn't look good when compressed because of its detail. I love that picture myself.
