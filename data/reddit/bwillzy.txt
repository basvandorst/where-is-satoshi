You are not hardened after 7 months in this market. You’ve only seen and felt hype, and not real dispair, to the point of losing all faith and forgetting about this project for 2 years.

Holding through adversity is where your high returns are earnt. Sure it might give even the most hardened of vets a twinge of uncertainty but in my opinion the odds trump any other form of gambling (or even traditional investing).

I feel your pain but chin up be proud of that 1.5 btc soldier for you are still a member of club 21 and your experience will mean holding that 1.5 until you are a half millionaire again

Funny thing...I never seen any holders posting regret stories, just people who sold or otherwise lost their coins

All coins originally came from miners and then people who bought from the miners sell them to the next person who buys them and so on.

I used a password database/generator to generate a secure password and my computer crashed after I encrypted the wallet but before I saved the database. Live and learn, but I’d find a way to get twice as much to make up for it if I were you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:43:43
I have a lot at stake but find it kind of amusing as the price goes down. It’s more interesting than it was when it was stuck st 16500 for 3 days.

This is an unhealthy mindset. Everybody knows what they should have done in the past. This is like being upset that you didn’t buy a lottery ticket now that you know the winning numbers after the draw. Money isn’t going to bring you peace of mind for long. Comfort is fleeting and if you had the house and the car you would find something else to pine after. It’s human nature to always want what you can’t have. Find peace from within first and you’ll discover the side effects it has on your life and those around you.

People are cashing out their investments and emptying their bank accounts en masse to purchase Bitcoin, both of which lose banks money. If anything, I’d say the concept is keeping them up at night.

It’s like eating when your hungry. Feels good for a few moments until you’re satisfied/bored and you move on to the next impulse/desire.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:26:42
What’s worked well for me has been a partnership with somebody else. We make a great team because our coins can’t be sold unless we both agree, which prevents impulsive selling. There has been times I wanted to sell (more than I’d like to admit), and she talked me out of it every time except once when I desperately needed the money. And there’s also been the odd time she wanted to sell and I talked her out of it.  Because of this we have been able to reach 25000% gains (at ATH) and hold on to 90% of our original balance.

Lost 16 btc back in 2013 by encrypting a wallet using a password generator. The computer mysteriously crashed before the password database was saved. As a result of the stress my body developed a nervous twitch that never has completely gone away. It may not be a gigantic loss like some others but it was everything we had at the time.
