Bit Square just launched and is a decentralised exchange. They never hold your bitcoin. Also, Bitfinex use multisig addresses so that's probably the most secure way your coins can be held on an exchange. Makes it exponentially more difficult that the exchange account can be hacked.

correct. I am not stating that -80 means -30 will be approved, rather that -80's approval comes at an interesting time and could have been implemented in anticipation of -30 approval. Ask yourself the question, if there was no Bitcoin ETF in the pipeline, would this application of rule change even have been filed? I can't answer that, but I can conclude that it does make sense that the exchange would want some additional procedures in place to accomodate a whole new asset class ETF where it is harder to anticipate what will happen and particularily the exchange would be foolish not to have additional procedures in place for delisting the ETF.   
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:27:07
the filling relates the BATS exchange and their method for delisting a product listed under rule 14.11. This is the rule the bitcoin ETF would be listed under. It cannot be established with certainty that it either is or isn't related to the bitcoin ETF filing, but the timing and some of the nuances discussed in the filling are quite relevant. There's no way the Winklevoos Brother's can list the ETF without taking all these new rules changes into account.

You can keep most of your wealth under your control. Top up as and when you need to. Major improvement over having a bank account. I am introducing others to these practises too and they love it. It's a great way to encourage bitcoin adoption, especially while it's in a bull market.

You don't go from A-Z overnight
@_date: 2016-11-29 15:24:42
it's been known for well over a year that the blocksize needed to be increased. Bitcoin Classic had overwhelming support from industry and was ignored. Miners wanted the increase and have more incentive to accept a client that gives them control of the blocksize than the small picture short term gains segwit can offer. Time for compromise is over imo. Core is not compromising. BU now has a high chance of becoming the dominant chain very soon and will fork the network. Rest of miners will likely follow to the dominant chain leaving bitcoin core client in limbo for weeks to months to readjust difficulty. This is what happens when you ignore large and important segments of the community. 
 
@_date: 2016-11-29 15:05:24
Fork would be really bad for minority chain as difficulty would take weeks to months to adjust depending how many follow over. Likely that the remaining hashing power supporting core would align with BU.

Peter R via bitcoin-dev 
"miners who set their block size limits (BSL) above OR below the "effective BSL" are disadvantaged.  Imagine that we plot the distribution (by hash power) for all miners' BSLs.  We might get a chart that looks like this:
In this chart, the "effective BSL" is defined as the largest block size that no less than half the hash power will accept.  
If a block is mined with a size Q that is less than the "effective BSL," then all the hash power with BSLs between BSL_min and Q will be forked from the longest chain (until they update their software if they're running Core or until their acceptance depth is hit if they're running BU).  This wastes these miners' hash power.  
However, if a block is mined with a size Q that is greater than the effective BSL, then all the hash power with BSLs between Q and BSL_max will temporarily be mining on a "destined to be orphaned" chain.  This also wastes these miners' hash power.  
Therefore, it is in the best interest of miners to all set the same block size limit (and reliably signal in their coinbase TX what that limit is, as done by Bitcoin Unlimited miners).  
We have empirical evidence the miners in fact behave this way: 
(1) No major miner has ever set his block size limit to less than 1 MB (not even those such as Luke-Jr who think 1 MB is too big) because doing so would just waste money.  
(2) After switching to Bitcoin Unlimited, both ViaBTC and the Bitcoin.com pool temporarily set their BSLs to 2 MB and 16 MB, respectively (of course keeping their _generation limit_ at 1MB).  However, both miners quickly reduced these limits back to 1 MB when they realized how it was possible to lose money in an attack scenario.  (This actually surprised me because the only way they could lose money is if some _other_ miner wasted even more money by purposely mining a destined-to-be-orphaned block.)   
The follow-up article I'm working on is about the topics we're discussing now, particularly about how Bitcoin Unlimited's “node-scale” behavior facilitates the emergence of a fluid and organic block size limit at the network scale.  Happy to keep continue with this current discussion, however."

I like Bitwala but this caption is slightly misleading. I sent about 800 euros worth onto the card on a Saturday and it took them nearly a day to credit the card. So take that into consideration if you are planning on paying someone/bill last minute.

yes, it's possible some entity has gained access to wikileak's bitcoin private key.
@_date: 2016-11-22 14:07:54
Right, I'd like to look into that a bit more before commenting. Did not see anything published detailing it was this progressed. Can you link anything?
Aside from that increasing the blocksize still makes sense. Smaller blocksize ultimately means higher fees on chain. If you want to use the lightning network there is more leverage to impose a higher fee on the transaction as it is still comparatively cheaper than sending a transaction on chain. I think we can all agree we want bitcoin to be as competitive a transaction fee market as is visable.

The seller cannot distinguish a bitcoin debit card from a normal debit card. The bitcoin debit card is used by others not using bitcoin to top it up. It's a worldpay card. If the vendor was going to adjust, they would already be doing so. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:42:49
there has been nothing ambiguous about his stance. Core need to release a client with the hard forked code, although it doesn't need to be activated. 
"It is acceptable that the hard fork code is not activated, but it needs to be included in a ‘release’ of Bitcoin Core."
Perfectly reasonable request as he wants assurance that Core intend to raise the blocksize past the size segwit increase allows for. There is a bigger picture here and he understand it. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 17:10:05
What makes you think you won't have a bloated blockchain by introducing off-chain transactions? Confidence in such a system is going to be a function of how fast/easily somebody can settle those transactions on-chain. Therefore as LN scales, the bitcoin blocksize will need to be increased anyway.   
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:54:46

Correct, it is not a definite proof. There is a real possibility that the Wikileaks bitcoin address is compromised. What is mathematically plausible is that somebody did try to communicate to Wikileaks very recently using the bitcoin blockchain. Remember, Wikileaks have used the blockchain before to communicate. If you are quick to dismiss what could be stored or encoded in these messages you could miss something important. 
Sending messages on the bitcoin blockchain is an excellent way to send a message as it is time-stamped, cannot be deleted and is a vehicle for sending a message in the event free speech is being suppressed.

I don't want there to be a split at all, I would just prefer if people considered more seriously that the Lightning Network might not be right around the corner and in the meantime we can scale with demand for the network by increasing the blocksize as needed. It's a very reasonable stance.

That's the seller's problem. I have all my assets in bitcoin and top up my bitwala card when needed which gives spot - 0.5%. I don't pay any additional fees paying for stuff with card. Buyers have many incentives to use this service (no bank account required = no bank fees (in the eurozone you get charged for everything), bulk of your money can be in your control) and it would be great for bitcoin adoption if others followed these practises. These practises probably will be competitive with the lightning network.  
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:47:08

Don't get your panties in a twist. It would not be a bad thing for bitcoin at all if we had bigger blocks one way or another.

If we only increase the blocksize through segwit and are waiting for the lightning network to come out, and nobody knows when it will actually come out, we will be right back where we are today again. Do you want to be calling people numpties again this time next year? What is so difficult to understand about this? It doesn't make any sense not to hardfork to increase the blocksize so that the network can continue to scale and grow while we are waiting for the lightning network to be developed, rigorously tested and rolled out.

@_date: 2016-11-22 13:38:38
 current size of the blockchain after 8 years is ~0.1TB. You can buy a 10TB harddrive for about $500 today. It is reasonable to expect this cost to come down significantly in the future, especially by the year 2816 when the harddrive would fill up if the bitcoin blocksize remained at 1MB. It could reasonably be increased a few X without much consequence to operating a full node. And exactly  very good point. Hopefully it gets some people reading this thread thinking in ways they haven't been before! 
@_date: 2016-12-12 12:13:24
When I say this I am not shitting on LN in anyway but we already have a form of LN that can provide Instant Payments, scaled, low cost (0.5% fee from spot). Make one bitcoin transaction on the blockchain and you can make multiple purchases with a bitcoin debit card provided by Bitwala, Xapo, etc and all of these transactions are off-chain. Now, I know it's not the complete product here but it amazes me that nobody seems to be aware of/acknowledge this amazing utility we have right now. I am aware the completed LN will be superior but even if we never created it we could probably scale bitcoin using fiat top up cards.

You have a purist perspective. While your points are valid concerns we should not cease and desist encouraging practises that ultimately promote the widespread adoption of bitcoin on concerns Visa may censor use of bitcoin debit cards in the future. For one, it is not in Visa's interest to censor everybody using these practises. They still win. It is likely that if Visa prohibited the use of bitcoin funded top up cards it would be because bitcoin is illegal in that state in which case you wouldn't be able to scale the lightning network anyway.
It is a paradox to denounce these practises while advocate for widespread bitcoin adoption. Both LN and this practise can be tools to introduce new people to the ecosystem. The difference being this is here today. LN is not.   
Get excited about introducing new people to Bitcoin first and foremost. Sing about this today, sing about the LN tomorrow.
