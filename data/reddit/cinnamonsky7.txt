AND the same thing happens in the regulated commodities market.

False. Are you saying that the more you've lost, the more willing you should be to sell? It's just the opposite actually. Anyway, the coins you are hodling have no idea what price they were purchased at. It's irrelevant.

This so reminds me of the pre-black friday online poker days. Some pre-paid cards worked, others did not. Some of them would work for a while, then stop working. I think once the card issuers get wind of something "controversial", they pull it. I used to have to go down to the shell station to buy mine. lol

It's only my opinion, of course, but you're selling when you should be buying. According to my system, you have a buy signal of $150 worth of btc for each btc you own (owned, but you could buy it back). $150 X 45 = $6750 is your buy signal. Bitstamp price is $375. Stop losses generally don't work.

Give Wells Fargo a call and tell them you're going to use it at circle, and see what they say.
Edit: On 2nd thought, maybe that's not such a good idea.

You're probably right.

Sometimes you have to register those cards online before you use them. Did you do that?
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:56:49
The way you do it is buy a little bit at a time as the price falls. You need to have a system that tells you exactly how much to buy and at which levels.
And no, this isn't dollar-cost-averaging, because as the price RISES past a certain point, you SELL a little bit at a time. Much more profitable than DCA. Also much better than absolute hodling.
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:42:41
I wasn't talking about daily dips. It should be a substantial dip, or substantial rise if you're looking for a sell signal. How substantial depends upon the parameters you've chosen for your particular system.
Hodling long-term is a good system for bitcoin, but trading and profiting on the fluctuations as it moves up and down is even better.

Maybe if Circle would allow people to buy a damn coin.
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:33:59
Those are the people who are buying right now. The smart people always buy the dips.
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:16:37
It's time to buy, not sell. If it suffers a further decline, buy some more. You don't have to sell some to buy cheaper later. What if you sell and it never gets any cheaper? You need a system that won't leave you out in the cold with no clothes on :))
@_date: 2014-10-02 17:26:43
You can check in but you can't check out? That's a typical online poker scam.
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:58:26
That's what i'm wondering about, cancelled transactions. Unacceptable for this to happen on a verified account. If they can avoid that, who in their right mind would use coinbase?

I wonder if the cash advance mandate is on circle's side, or the card issuer's side. Because some people are getting charged the cash advance fee with credit cards, and some are not.
@_date: 2014-10-04 01:45:56
Know your constitutional rights! For starters, anytime a cop stops you, it's a criminal investigation, and you have the right to remain silent. Any attorney worth his salt will tell you NEVER talk to a cop. The only things you might possibly want to say are, "Am I being detained?" "Am I free to go?" "Under what reasonable suspicion?" "I don't answer questions." Stuff like that. Because it WILL be held against you. A good idea is to say "My attorney has advised me to remain silent".
Also, it's unlawful for him to detain you while he waits for the sniffer dog. A lot of these highway cop-robbers these days have Fido riding shotgun, though.
The important thing to remember is, don't let him stick his foot in the door, because he'll bust it wide open. And always videotape the stop, streaming straight to the web.
Also, it goes without saying, that you should NEVER consent to ANY kind of search, even if you THINK you have nothing to hide.

It's possible that a card that worked yesterday won't work today. Those pre-paid cards are very fickle that way.

I find it hilarious that so many of you guys are now complaining that it's too easy to buy bitcoin. It's the best thing that's ever happened for us. You've been put through the wringer for so long, it has become the norm to you. Now you want tougher AML KYC anti-fraud? You sound like the fucked up regulators.

Bitcoin price is being manipulated so "they" can buy it all up very cheaply before the colossal monetary crash. Don't let them fuck you out of your coin. "You've got to know when to hodl'em, know when to fodl'em..."

A couple days ago I read that circle's plan for fraud protection was to "tweak" the instant-buy. I thought "Uh-oh! Cancellations ala coinbase." But what's happening now is worse than I could have imagined. CustServ told one customer that their anti-fraud filter was "a bit strict" right now, but they have no plans to loosen it. A "bit" strict?! Practically everyone is being slammed! Others are being lied to and told it's a bug. 
Circle, if the acct is verified, give them their damn coins.
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:54:56
Regulations do not in any way protect you from heavy manipulation. Look at the commodities market.
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:38:08
yes, in the long run, all that is going to matter is the # of coins you own, and the # of ounces you own.

Has anyone been denied transferring their bitcoin from Circle to their personal wallet? Just wondering how bad this is. Seems like the only person in this thread that circle is working for, is a guy in UK.
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:24:45
Does anyone know of a credit card that does not charge cash advance fees for buying at Circle?
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:53:17

That's great news, but i'm wondering about a credit card that could be used at circle with no cash advance fees.

The coins that you own have no memory, kinda like how dice have no memory.

The buy pressure is there, but the price is being intentionally suppressed, just like precious metals. All the classic signs are apparent.
That being said, it's time to buy; both bitcoin and precious metals, especially silver. It's an incredible opportunity to get in this cheaply. It can't be manipulated much longer.

The London Silver Fix at the LBMA has ended as of Aug 17th (that's actually what it is officially called, blatant as all hell), but has shifted to the CME fix in NY. Probably even worse, as evidenced by the recent preposterous decline.
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:53:55
Because I think it's going to be HUGE, unless govt regulations kill it. It's high risk, but much higher reward. Remember, the most you can lose right now is $376. How much do you think is the most you can gain?
In the futures market, you can lose much more than your original investment. That's impossible with bitcoin (unless you're leverage trading), and that's an enormous plus.
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:23:34
This means it is still VERY early, which is a wonderful thing.
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:32:49
It depends on how much capital gain you have. You can offset all of your capital loss against capital gain, but you can only offset $3000 of capital loss against your income per year. The rest of the loss over $3000 can be offset in the following years, no limit on the number of years that might take.
You report it just like stocks, and yes, coinbase fees are deductible.
