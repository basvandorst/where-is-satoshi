No chargebacks is key!  Item returns and exchanges would be different, right?  When the customer returns the item at what BTC rate would they get back?  Would they get the current rate, the rate they bought it at, or fiat at the fiat value they exchanged BTC for?

Absolutely!  You know why? Because PayPal does not service every country in the world like bitcoin does.  How can you send money back to your family in your home country for less than $1 with PalPay or Western Union?  You can't ... bitcoin is the answer.  Hope that helps.

Awesome answer and reasons, thanks!  One part that I'm really stuck on is converting BTC to fiat.  This is the lifeblood of exchanges so converting all or some portion of BTC sales to fiat is necessary for the to stay alive and continue to service the clients they have onboarded, however, if BTC is so good and has a bright future, why should the merchant convert at all?  This seems like a catch 22 and it's keeping me up at night.  Any insight?
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:33:56
Thanks.  I'll do that now.

Interac e-transfer in Canada is my preferred method to buy.  However, great job on now accepting Interac Online. It's the second best in my option for not having to leave your house to fund a bitcoin exchange with fiat.  Cheers!

Because of this promotion Vault of Satoshi just overtook CaVirtex in daily volume for the first time ever!

This is true but there are plenty of people who don't mind paying a little extra for convenience of using credit cards to get their bitcoins almost instantly.  Since sending money via VISA or MasterCard is only available through Western Union in Canada there will not be any exchange rate fees because we are working with Canadian dollars.
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:44:06
Totally, but it's still worth $700 CDN.

Here's the reply to my support ticket:
we've got some issues with incoming transactions not showing up. The reason is a problem with one of our background processes. We're working on fixing the issue but I can't give you an ETA yet.

As you know, Ross Ulbricht was convicted of 7 felony accounts in February 2015, based on accusations of creating and operating the anonymous online marketplace Silk Road, under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts.
We agree with Ross' attorneys that the trial was not fair.  The jury was not allowed to hear the government's own evidence, favourable to Ross, or the fact that the investigation was tainted by internal corruption.  Ross' attorney has filed for an appeal, both for the verdict and sentencing.
OUR GOAL:
- To fight for the right to a fair trail, one of the bulwarks of our liberty
- To finance Ross' appeal of he verdict and sentence
- To have precedents set in this case reversed
- To have Ross ultimately be a free man
Despite our owing them a huge amount of money, Ross' attorneys are not deserting him.  They are preparing an appeal working to have Ross placed where he is in the least danger.  But as always, we are up against the full force of the federal government.  We are not the family of a wealthy kingpin.  We own no bitcoin.  There is no hidden wallet. We are regular people taking on a giant fight against a Goliath.
We can't do this alone ... to aide in this fight and show your support please go on ahead and place your order to don your very own "Free Ross" T-Shirt.
