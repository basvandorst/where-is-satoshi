Now I'm falling asleep
As she turns up the gas
While he's putting on gloves
And she's prepping the knife
Now they're cutting my dick
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my ledger
But it's not worth 1mil
Now, he's taking a snip
Now..... letting my dick go
I just can't look its killing me
And now I've got no dick......

If you don’t want to go off impulse and are looking at the long term investment, I think it would be wiser to go with eth or litecoin during the hype train.
I believe ETH and LTC are far superior to Bitcoin which seems like it’s more of a “stock” than currency  in the past year.
Eth has amazing tech backing it, and Vitalik is a genius who steers the community to technological advancement rather than pushing the “get rich” mentality and hodl memes, he says if you want to make money, design a dApp rather than buy and hold.
Both eth and LTC have much better usability - fast and cheap to use, bitcoin is a pain in the ass to use and will only get worse... 9 year tech is ancient in today’s world.
Ex: I bought 2 games from the same website, one with bitcoin and one with litecoin.
litecoin transaction approved within a minute and cost $0.01 USD.
bitcoin transaction took 4+ hours to approve (I used a higher than average transaction fee) by the time it went through the game was out of stock, took me 2 more days to get it - thankfully support was cool about it.

Ethereum and LTc, id rather invest my time and money in those. The tech aspect of eth is absolutely fascinating and Vitalik Buterin is my fucking idol.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:04:42
Why do you think that it’s betraying bitcoin? It’s so much different, I’m sure you know more about it than I do, but could you elaborate on why you think so?

“Redditor for 3 weeks” educating you on crypto lingo.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:42:44
Please keep using Coinbase, put all your assets in it, honestly open up a loan against your house and use that money to buy all your bitcoins right now!!!!!! It’s all about getting rich!!! 
You obviously know exactly what decentralized currency is and what it stands for, and why Coinbase is just the right type of institution to hold your assets in. it’s a bitcoin bank! Yay! They’ll even print out your bitcoins if you ask them I bet! 
You should travel the world and teach us all about crypto, Antonopoulos would love your input on FDIC insured crypto exchanges and how we should all put our fucking money into them.
Your just the type of person we need in this community, you should tell all your friends to use coinbase as well, tell all the guys about it at church on Sunday! Bring it up at the next rally!
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:27:49
Use gemni, don’t believe people praising coinbase, they’re either employees or want you to lose money.
Check out if you don’t believe me.
Transfer your money to your own wallet, never keep it on exchange.
Don’t let the hype control your wallet, buy ethereum and litecoin instead for now instead of bitcoin, compare charts for eth/Ltc vs btc and you’ll see that the other two are better.
This hype is very suspicious, esp. with the shady forks happening, the Russians can be paid to hype anything on social media and it works.
Shame on all of you for recommending this shithole btw, you’re a bunch of assholes.
Coinbase goes against everything crypto stands for.
Go ahead and downvote me all you want, if you’re promoting Coinbase than you have 0 clue what crypto is and you’ll remember this once they seize your account for no reason.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:12:55
Remind yourself you said that when your account gets seized for no reason and tells you "no problem we're looking into it right away!"
Or stop being stupid and take a look at before telling people nothing is wrong with them.
Withdraw all your money and maybe you'll get to keep some of it, maybe some of it will get lost in the coinbase ether... either way, don't be so stupid.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:33:32
Depends on your power cost.
Start small, build one rig or two and use GPU’s because they have great resell value. 
Your antminers will be worthless eventually and have no resale value because nobody would buy a used one.
Don’t mine bitcoin, start with something simple like nicehash to get into the swing of things. Nicehash will mine altcoins and trade them to BTC for you, and it will mine the ones that are the most profitable for the day based on your hardware. 
Make sure you have cheap enough power to make it worthwhile.

Like, how’s does a transaction take 2 hrs to complete sending from cb, yet when I send from a wallet it’s there a lot faster with WAY less fees. They also support 2x, so fuck them in general.
Check dude.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:04:36
Don’t worry about it at all, you’re getting into it and that is what matters.
Coinbase is great for getting into it, I’m glad they’re around because of that, but it is a learning curve for everyone that gets into it.
Just research as much as you can, and don’t jump on hype trains!
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:15:15
Olga, thanks for the response. So what you’re saying is that for sending 1$ I have to pay 2$ to miners? I’m sorry, but I just don’t believe that since when I send wallet to wallet it is pennies, but if I send coinbase wallet to coinbase wallet it’s 2$.

I’m on gigabit fiber, 1000/1000 with 0ms ping and good hardware, running windows 10. Would I be able to setup a full node?
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:06:36
nope. i honestly thought there was alot more to setting up a full node, i.e. setting up a linux server/etc.

Who cares m8? Just buy and spend like cash, keep the economy going. 
He’s doing a good thing for the community by getting in, you’re discouraging new people who want to adopt the tech and being nothing more than a gateholder.  
Stop it. We need to welcome all new people and educate them, not what you’re doing.
Highly doubt it’ll hit 3k$ anytime soon, the trend is up up up, and I hear more and more people talking about it that never even knew what it was a year ago.

If I do it on my good box, it shouldn’t be that long right? I downed and installed core when I got home, looks like it’s already done updating.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:02:39
Thanks, that's a better explanation than "it doesn't exist, fuck you" =)
Here's a test I ran. This is with 3 people gaming/streaming and 2 boxes mining.
And yes, I can see now how they're both CenturyLink servers, even though Seattle is about 45miles from where im 
Testing through comcast servers brings me to 1-2ms.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:09:53
Use a mix of wallets:
Hot wallet for spending: If you’re on IOS I’d check out blockchain. Very nice wallet.
Use the core wallets for holding your assets, litecoin core, bitcoin core, etc.
Paper wallet: for holding large amounts, spread among your friends and hold somewhere in safekeeping, passwords/private keys separated/laminated/in bags and burn proof boxes.
You are in charge of your money now, not some bank, you are at the mercy of yourself. 
Stay smart and safe!
Welcome to the club :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:54:49
Yes, purchases go through quick. Try to send some BTC to a wallet, the blockchain wallet for instance, see how long it takes and check the fees. 
Then send the same amount from the blockchain wallet to a diff wallet and check the time and fees.
Personally i’d use GDAX (it’s part of cab), or use exodus to convert other crypto to BTC. Gemini is a good exchange as well.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:18:47
I think it’s safe, but I wouldn’t on principle and moral.
Crypto is about decentralization and ownership, these things are the big staples. 
Coinbase owns your funds and can freeze your account at any time, and I think they use it to their advantage. I also think that the long transfer times are fishy and that they are doing short term investing with your crypto on top of charging ridiculous fees.
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:26:29
You’re at their mercy, your money is not yours when you’re with cb. They’ll freeze your money for spending it on a Russian website buying a completely legal supplement.

Sweet. I looked at the write up and it looks like I’ve already done a part of it.
Fuck 2x
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:58:20
What do you recommend as a “real exchange”?
Preferably not one that is on the shitwit2x scam.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:50:33
Olga, I did send from one coinbase account to another. 
I had a friend and my girlfriend both up a coinbase account last night, sent my friend 1$ from my coinbase to his, and then sent my gf 20$ he same way - I was charged $2.01 to send the 20, and $2.00 to send 1$. You’re saying that I shouldn’t have had a fee sending coinbase &lt;-&gt; coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:49:05
It does on gigabit fiber in a “test” area. I regularly get between 0-2ms ping on speedtest.net
