Then you dig in and it's all just marketing buzzwords. Zero explanation on how their business model works beyond "sell worthless tokens/PROFIT!". 
Yes, buy these worthless tokens and they'll enable IoT cloud blockchains to crypto-economically disrupt the market. You dont' know what that means? It's OK, just buy this cheap and you'll be able to flip it for 10X the price!

True but it's technically not a closed cycle. The plants are turning nutrients, water and solar energy into organic matter.
Good for them for running their mining with organic waste.

"it's for kids" meant they didn't care what it was as long as it was made within the budget.

A blockchain is a database. The value token are just an incentive to help run it. A State could use other means to encourage maintaining the chain.

In many places something smaller than this would have a "3 eyes" rule: 3 different people validating that "yes, X amount is going from Y to Z". Less changes of a mistake.

You are correct, I mixed up certain legal documents that usually have validation by 3 people and the 4 eyes principle.
For a billion dollar transaction I wouldn't mind a few extra pair of eyeballs.

It was designed to be able to lose nodes so your wife isn't shutting down the whole Internet down. Just your node.

Quite true. Making Internet UX is not easy and certainly feels like going against the technology to wrestle a pleasant UX for the end-user.

Plus routers, as UX goes, should be pretty much a black box you plug-in and forget completely. Preconfigured routers and UPnP have helped in this regard. Web interfaces for advanced stuff is nice for advanced users but most shouldn't have to go in there.
This is infrastructure and shouldn't be an user-facing device.
The same could be said about the Bitcoin protocol. It's the wallets where the meat of the UX lies much like, for Internet access the browser/Internet app would.

*You* are imagining numbers. I quoted no numbers.
Space X, in this reality at least, was jumpstarted on ISS resupply contracts.
@_date: 2016-05-01 14:57:31
Without government contracts there wouldn't be any Space X either.
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:25:05
What does that have to do with anything we are discussing here?
@_date: 2016-05-20 12:11:44
A spontaneous reward, why not? Half is quite a bit much in any case.
@_date: 2016-05-01 19:29:38
I understand that but as things are it is a fact that Space X is using government contracts as seed to company. And this is part of NASA's current plan to help privatize LEO (which is great).

It is not crypto currency but cellphone-based payments are big in certain parts of Africa. M-Pesa in Kenya makes a super-slim SIM that slips on top of your usual carrier SIM card and allows to make simple payments with it. Useful in countries like Kenya where traditional banking doesn't covers most people.
I wish there was a similar way to extend crypto currencies in those types of regions but until the Internet covers them, no blockchain. Or at least not without an trusted intermediate.

They even try to hire people at DEFCON. This year they mostly got the finger but they don't just hire suit-and-tie college grads.

Like any money, the only value is has is the value people give it. If LTC has demand then it's worth something.

And how is that different for any currency?
Except the demand doesn't disappears during the collapse, it's the other way round.

I think people should think of freedom. A currency without a central governing body. A currency that can be transferred from person to person over just about any means of communication without the need for a third party.

The biggest problem with that is that is sets a precedent of users having to share their passwords. So it opens them up to phishing.
