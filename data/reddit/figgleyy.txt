Jesus. I'll definitely be moving my BTC to my pc late Octoberish.

Once this "2x attack" hits what will happen to the integrity of my BTC? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:08:18
Okay, thanks mate!

Yeah I've seen this, I have the same issue that I have GBP and not EURO, I cannot see a way to transfer from my GBP wallet to my EURO wallet to then transfer from my EURO wallet to my bank (which is going to cost me £16 thanks coinbase)

Yeah unfortunately due to this error whether my fault or coinbase I've had to repurchase my bitcoin and have gotten 0.004 less than I originally sold which is annoying. Transferring them off coinbase ASAP.

Okay so it seems I have to somehow put my GBP wallet contents into my EUR wallet to then transfer to my bank, fun.

Apologies for responding again but due to working full time I don't get much energy to read up on this stuff.
I have Bitcoin core downloaded on my computer, all of my coins are currently on coinbase for my mobile. Would you recommend I transfer these coins from my phone to my bitcoin core wallet ASAP and fully encrypt them make notes of the keys etc?

I have bitcoin core on my computer, would that suffice?
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:16:16
couldn't* give a shit

Yeah fuck coinbase. Feels like an actual scam from a British perspective, doesn't tell you that you can't withdraw GBP back into your account which means you have to purchase BTC again and withdraw it into your EUR wallet, and during this charade BTC has gone up. Sold 0.1 for £423 and bought 0.965 for the same prixe. Such a fucking joke. Any profit I did made has just been royally fucked due to the thousands of fees they add on to any kind of transaction.

Jeez so what do I do with my coins once the fork hits? I kinda wanna sell so I don't end up losing my money not being experienced...

As a complete beginner to BTC and my overwhelming dread that I've pissed £325 down the drain this really helped me understand what's going on. So bottom line is transfer my coins to a wallet where I keep my private keys and just don't spend any of it until it merges back?
