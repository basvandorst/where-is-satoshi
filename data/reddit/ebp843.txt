No its over for Apple when trump starts the anti trust proceedings. That money will flow somewhere.. and when Bitcoin takes off again.. it will probly FOMO into it

once agin you arnt seeing the full picture yes you are right a little bit but no one uses those social networks. Theres something called the network effect that draws people in and yes when these networks collude its called a cartel. Apple might be fine but i could be wrong. Im talking mainly google apple facebook even amazon. It can be argued in supreme court, and guess what?  They are smearing his nomination to prevent this it, or it might not matter. Yea these other search engine exists but they dont have googles algorithm so no one uses them. Monopolies can only exist with the help of government. LOOk it up. Monopolies cant exist in a free market. Guess who has contracts with governments? oH yea BIG TECH. eitherway its just like my opinion bro... im just trying to predict the future over  here you are just being a negative nancy... if this conflicts with your view of reality i apologize. Its a possiblity.. I would dump all my FAANG stocks if i had any... In other words i would bet money on my version of reality.. you wouldnt
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:58:06
yes im aware of this.. go and do your research. How often do the Major Tech CEOs sell at the exact same time. Cant find another instance except for after aug 24th
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:58:09
im not fretting i own no FAANG stocks (which seem to be crashing right now) Instagram founders just quit FB. So something is going on behind the scenes and im using trying to use logic to predict the future. It makes sense when u think about it. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:46:14
They know trump is about to crack down (anti trust).. thats why theyve been censoring conservatives before the midterms
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:15:21
I accept your apology.. but its kinda funny how a guy starts a news organization called InfoWars and is shut down, almost verifying his "consiracy theories" i didnt pay any attention to Jones until he was censored. And why are people censored? Not for inciting violence ( the US invades countries all the time and kills people with drones). Its because what he says is a threat to SOMEONES power. Ive heard plenty of flat earth bullshit that hasnt been shut down for being "false". People need to understand we are living in a 1984 style authoritarian government... not democracy.. There is a part of our government that cannot be overruled by the president or congress or ANY branch of government. That entity is known as the Federal Reserve, a conglomerate of banks. Who by the way fund almost EVERY politician and war. So you see things arnt what they seem. Most of america is living in a lie that this is a free market democracy. Its not because you cant have a free market with BAD MONEY. If an entity loans out money to the GOvernment (FED) they have power over every market and the entire economy. And you are telling me that BIG TECH's stocks arnt owned by banks?

Tim cook sold the DAY of the meeting.. The other CEOs mulled it over the weekend. The time frame is just too close for it to be a coincidence.. Do the research and use logic.. The censorship is getting out of hand. They are desparate
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:54:23
what... u know what i mean fool. This isnt grammar school
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:53:39
No one is freetting, I dont own any FAANG stocks. Just putting out an idea ive put a little research into
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:50:22
i think hes making his own coin or something. but yea crypto is the future and this is why
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:00:14
I never said this was FACT. I said the meeting was FACT and the CEOs selling was FACT. 
Im a nobody, i cant prove this in a court of law. Im providing my opinion dbag. Let me guess, youre one of those fuks that want to ban people for their opinion
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:25:29
Not to mention i had a twitter account with 30k followers that got banned for good. Not fun working my ass off to get those just to be censored. Not a great feeling... I didnt incite violence or anything, i did break the rules, but these rules go against the constitution. If i can do what i did on the streets i wouldnt go to jail. So why are the digital "streets" any different So my point is that these institutions have too much power and they effectively answer to no one. We need to regulate these companies like public utilities
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:48:07
Well that stock market money has to flow somewhere.. when cryptos finally blast off again.. its all over for them
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:52:44
haha if u care so much to tell a random person you dont know to shut up... maybe you should look it up your damn self. Im tellin up the facts and how they correlate with the rumors. Im not spoon feeding some internet jackass
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:49:41
This is a political thing.. Amazon insiders have been selling off like crazy.. I dont think Bezos has been tho. This is all due to censoring conservatives..
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:07:54
So why are conservatives getting banned while liberals are free to trash whoever and use "hate speech". BIG TECH has a monopoly on the internet. I know this because i have a crypto related website that can finally advertise on Google today. Do you not think running a country is a little bit more complicated then "trump understands trade"! No there are power players trying to take you down no matter who you are or how much power u have. So yea you get one aspect of it but not seeing it from every angle. BIG TECH is too powerful but they can be broken up.. If trump does it he will be one of the best presidents in history. I was a liberal a month ago BTW. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:49:29
im just putting the facts out there.. there will always be conspiracies when theres money and power involved.. You can check all this out yourself its pretty easy. But yes Trump is about to make a move on BIG TECH
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:02:31
Umm you need to look up definition of monopoly.. Is there another FB i can go to to put up ads? is there another twitter i can go to? Is there another search engine that people use? NO there  are a few companies acting as the gatekeepers of information.
No they are monopolies and they can be crushed with the anti trust laws.  
Blockchains will take over in their place
You sound really dumb thinking you know everything thats going on. You dont and I dont. Im looking at logic and trying to connect the dots. 
Yea there should be some censorship, but not of political ideas. Not sure what we are arguing about sir. I was throwing out a theory i had, and u clearly are more connected to the upper echelons of society than I am.. NOT
So u have even less proof than me. and you are too one dimensional and have no imagination so why would i accept your view of reality it doesnt reflect actuality. Im not accusing anyone in a court of law im just sayin my belief in the future which im entitled to do. I said trump would be the greatest president if he carried this out. Not saying he is currently.
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:54:08
because if its parked in cash you lose via inflation. The money wont come from the CEOs directly but from investors selling off. And crypto will look like the deal of a lifetime
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:49:20
So yea i guess apple might be fine for now. But this could still have a negative effect on all FAANG stocks
@_date: 2018-09-26 01:49:07
Yea well why cant these companies just take down those specific videos? why is he completely silence? Something is up. And if u actually listen to him he pretty much just speaks up against the "deep state". I didnt even think or cared they exist until he was censored. That is some big brother shit and if u support that we are all fucked. Yes but these companies accept government money and contracts so they should be subject to the constitution. Like why am i even arguing this. free speech is free speech even if you dont agree with it. There should be some limits but political opnions are not one.. Last time i checked it says in the constitution that you are allowed to bear arms for a reason, to protect against tyrannical governments. Which its starting to look that way with the censorship
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:52:18
get on Marketwatch.com and look at the insider tab of your favorite BIG TECH companies. If u dont care enough to do your research, then i dont care to fish it out for u
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:54:31
He can after them for plenty of other stuff like tax evasion. Why do u think Trump is cracking down on China? Because big tech is colluding with the chinese with internet propaganda techniques
