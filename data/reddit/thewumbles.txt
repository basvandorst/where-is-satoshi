Coinbase vault gives you the majority of keys (eg 2 of 3) in a multisig key. The majority is required to sign transactions. If you lose both keys your Bitcoin is lost forever.
One bitcoin always equals one bitcoin. You don't "lose money", it's value is the same as a bitcoin anywhere. It's exchange value fluctuates regardless of where it is stored.
@_date: 2016-08-09 04:57:40
Yes, possibly much higher. There's way too much good economic news today.

I love thinking about the moral implications of bitcoin -- essentially Internet cash. You can buy drugs or gamble, you can donate it to a good cause, you can hide it under your bed, or put it in a bank where the government will now know that it is (or was) yours. Drop it somewhere new, burn it, or buy gum with it. I'd try to contact the owner. Or take it. Or don't. Somebody else might one day.

I disagree. If you take tether for your bitcoin, you are assuming the associated risk. I would only take hard assets or an intermediary currency that is widely accepted, and even then only temporarily. I don’t think most people hold tether. Tether is the newest flavour of FUD.

@_date: 2018-01-21 22:38:30
Tether is just another shitcoin like the USD it does so well to emulate. Its value only affects its holders. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:23:03
The threat of tether only affects those that hold it or rely on it to move value. Whether or not that affects the value of bitcoin is up for those holders of bitcoin to decide.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:44:42
So why were fees even implemented? It’s not a trivial addition. You’re wrong.

So far in 2018 it looks like at least four nations will be maintaining some portion of reserves in bitcoin. This is the beginning of the gargantuan national wealth adoption phase with trillions to flow in. The money involved is astronomical. The flood is coming.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:46:37
They technically never left your originating address (until the transaction is mined). I don’t foresee any worthwhile forks any longer — most of these shitforks are below 1% value at this point, and there is (always) some danger / associated costs in redeeming them.

Coinbase is regulated, and they're safe -- but they're required to track you and their CEO is a complete dolt.

Only after many months -- the market / exchange of coins will determine the price of a coin, which in turn dictates the amount of energy and investment (hashrate) that can be expended on expected future return (coin / selling that coin for paying the bills).

To accept bitcoin, you actually generate your own empty addresses which you provide, and then the person sends value to it. You're viewing value in an address that is not under your control.
Like the OP stated, youre just reading about value that exists in somebody else's control (not necessarily even your counterparty) . You have zero control over it.
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:48:47
For sure my dude. Regardless the system is self-regulating -- if true usage or spam causes x cost per transaction, we are incentivized to make fewer transactions / go off chain. Spam becomes naturally much more expensive and disincentivized. Hypothetically if the chain doesn't scale only true long term savings and commercial settlement use will be reasonable with transactions costing 10 or even 100 dollars per. That's alright, too, but unfortunate. That will cause bitcoin-backed banks with their own secured tokens to become a reality imo.

The point is, you should never have such crazy exploitable code on live nodes. This is an economic system of exchange dealing with people's savings and impacting their day to day economic activity - not simply something trivial like bit torrent. It's as bad as having a bank with holes in the back of the vault with access to your safety deposit boxes and deposited savings.
They were shoddily patched -- one was a closed source binary. Completely unprofessional and counter to the spirit and standard operation of a collective open source effort.

Because it's not designed to work for you if you don't pay a market rate. If there is "life changing" money riding on Bitcoin you aught to pay a few cents extra to ensure your transaction is mined.

"Not even 1 confirmation" ... once you get in a block, each successive block is a confirmation. You're only paying to get into that first block - and really it's the only confirmation that matters. The rest are "free", and simply added layers of security for your transaction not to be orphaned and reversed.

Because it's a flawed economic system where there is no reason to mine due to no fee pressure. Living in dream world will only last for so long. They will eventually need to fork in inflation. These folks rather have their money eroded over time than pay per transaction like you should. And this is why bitcoin will win.

Hey! Thanks for using bitcoin as a merchant. You should understand that if half of the world's merchants like yourself used bitcoin, fees would be astronomical, even with 300mb blocks! 
If you haven't checked out lightening network, I recommend that you do. It's a lightweight payment network built on Bitcoin that will be ideal for instantaneous, secure bitcoin transactions!

Fiat money is manipulated by those few, as we have bailouts that decrease the wealth of millions to the advantage of the few who get us in this mess with fiancialization and immoral investment. This was, probably, the reason for its creation.
Bitcoin, like gold, can only promise you a sliver of wealth that cannot be diluted by the hands of powerful individuals or groups. 
Only this sliver is a provable portion of a known whole, is immaterial, free to hold and ideally transacted, easy to prove ownership over, and if hidden properly cannot be seized by theft or force.
It's not evil. It's a tool. And it's the best one we got!

A developer should answer, I have no idea. It could also be that if Core is not optimized for LAN use (and why should it really?) then you'll tax the network more than you'll increase utility.

Bitcoin has a real value proposition that is largely solidified due to its strong network effect / dedicated user base. This doesn't exist for any other feasible coin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:59:33
Market cap / aggregate value is a flawed metric that is based on the number of coins in circulation multiplied by the last traded price. Of course, when you're airdropped money on a blockchain that has zero real value things get pretty crazy. Any value you get out of it is great though. Thanks to those miners and traders who gave me money for this shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:43:59
The economics and incentive structures of the coin are broken. It sacrifices long term scaling / feasibility / thinking for short term gains / thinking.
It will never have support of the bitcoin elite: developers (innovators) and whales, or the masses of users (because of these previous groups), because of these things -- and this alone dooms it.
It is the working longer term economy of a coin that support it and carry it forward.
This is why bitcoin will always succeed, and new fads will come and are guaranteed to go. 
Just don't mistake this truth for hubris.

Welcome to r/bitcoin. Learn about the upcoming second transaction layer called lightening and how amazing and cheap it will be. Also learn why a fee market must exist on the main chain to maintain security and carry bitcoin feasibly into the future. There are many people that don't understand these necessities, or worse, are willfully ignorant and attempting to manipulate your thoughts and actions! Enjoy your stay!
Edit: with so many inputs your transaction will be considerably more expensive. This is the nature of the beast. Try to keep your bitcoin consolidated. You can wait for a lull in activity to collect the "dust" cheaply.

Otherwise I recommend a hardware wallet for significant amounts. Or breadwallet / paper for amounts 1-50k.

Had an argument with a FED researcher who'd worked for both NY and Atlanta. Thought hoarding would destroy bitcoin. Countered that gold had done fairly well since before recorded history and linked to the 1930s version of Disney's Grasshopper and the ants. "Hoarders" = savers.

No, core has created a more sophisticated block building algo that will confirm a low fee transaction in the same block as a high fee transaction that depends on a spend from the aforementioned low fee transaction as far as I remember. This is because you may make a higher block transaction fee in total by considering this. Clearly they're not fans.
Edit: I guess this would be a fair requirement, and an odd consideration regardless when testing a transaction bribe interface...

The only way to verify your coins for yourself is to run a node. That ability, and its decentralized nature are central to its value. Without either of these aspects bitcoin would be worthless.

It’s ... kinda an inflection point isn’t it? It’s kinda proving itself to be... well.. digital gold. For good.

No, before it IPOed. Like most private companies that go big it most likely had many rounds of capital injection. With each round a valuation is in order, and it probably ballooned tremendously for early investors as it scaled and grew.. 100x+ growth.

Welcome to the show. In bitcoin people try to take your money. 
They'll try to scare you into not buying, or buying at the wrong time, or  they'll try to convince you something else has more value, or will persuade you to trade.
They'll try every trick in the book... And if it works, they'll end up with more bitcoin, and you'll end up with less.
If you're interested, learn about the technology. Learn about the economics. Hard money is important. The technology is revolutionary, and will improve in time. If you're comfortable, buy some. But do not trade, and do not sell. Stick to your guns, and stick around!

So bread is simply a wallet -- a way to receive, safely store, and send bitcoin. It's secure because your private keys are encrypted via the secure enclave hardware on your iOS device (and never exposed in the FS).
You MUST record your backup phrase. This is your bitcoin wallet, and can be used to safely restore your wallet if you lose your phone, or if it is broken.
You must then obtain bitcoin separately and send the coin to the addresses generated by your wallet to take possession of them. You can do this on an exchange, where you send your money to exchange it for bitcoin. I recommend Gemini, GDAX, or Kraken as safe.
You can also use Localbitcoins or local bitcoin ATMs to get bitcoin in a more anonymous and fast way, but you pay premiums (up to 15-20%) and encounter greater counterparty risk!

Miners. They're already becoming centralized and too powerful under Bitmain and their monopoly on miners/asicboost efficiency. With their size and edge on faking proof of work they make the most money and can starve off other miners/manufacturers. 
If they can expand blocksize at will, under bitcoin unlimited, nodes are forced off the network. You and I can't run data centers to keep up validating and retaining full trustless and anonymous payment. Further centralization occurs and bitcoin will be destroyed as a trustless, decentralized, libre, p2p payment network.

If segwit is bullish for the price of bitcoin, then miners will have to sell fewer coins to pay for their present energy expenditure - and keep more as profit. The truth is most likely somewhere in between. As Adam has hinted at believing, there is most likely a large deployment and maneuvering of position/future hash power. The big players in mining want to be in position to dominate and soak up all profit from an explosion of value. It's that or external influence and the desire to extend/delay/extinguish. 
Either way -- this is centralization, and it ain't cool. My 2c.

I'm no expert, but I'm sure you will be able to prune witness data. It will make your node less useful.

If T1 has been validated, and you want to double spend T2 you need to rebuild the chain since before T1.

There are a good number of debt bubbles fueling speculation in assets considered "safer" by traditional investors (stocks and real estate as examples). 
Look at student debt, consumer debt, or government debt. Government debt is looking particularly worrisome in an ever changing geopolitical landscape, especially with commitments to programs such as social security, medicare/medicaid, or public pensions at all levels of government. People who rely on these programs will find themselves up shit creek very quickly if they are cut, or we will see a devaluation of the currency to cover these commitments -- which will increase costs across the board (you just get them cut in a different way -- less for the same money). Either way, the people at the bottom will be crushed. Often times, if people start to feel the burn due to these rising costs of living or shortfalls in pensions or asset bubbles, other speculative assets that they own take major hits as those same people are forced to liquidate to make up the difference.
It's just general boom and bust doom porn. Bitcoin won't fare any better than any other speculative asset. So I'm not saying to invest. Just make sure you are diversified, and do not rely on government or anyone at all who promises you ANYTHING. Self sufficiency is key to weather the ups and downs of life. Having a plan and a good idea about what will hold value or gain value in the future (especially when prices are low and people are suffering) is what sets apart good investors from bad ones.

The point is addressed: easy is not freedom. The assets are fundamentally different. The method of transmission is completely different. If you don't see that then you are simply a moron. I don't care who wants to stick with the banks. The world is big enough that smart people are attracted to smart ideas, and the network effect will attract the rest of the herd.

Thanks for reposting this (it made its rounds about a year ago). Definitely one of the most interesting ideas I've seen to improve the blockchain protocol. I'm undecided on if / how it would break the equilibrium which keeps Bitcoin going. Saw some interesting comments but wish I could have some of the big names in Bitcoin weigh in to know what they think.

Since everyone knows of this event, there should really not be much of a change/implication. But it is a decrease in the generated amount of coins. Inflation goes from ~4 to ~2% annually. Fewer coins being created / sold / circulated = increased price, goes the theory.

Bitcoin Core is a decentralized, open source project in which anyone competent can join, collaborate, and build the future together. Consensus is driven by the goal of scale, functionality, and the alignment of economic protocol/realities with technical ones, without the sacrifice of decentralization.
Any backdoor deal or centralized development cannot compete on these grounds, and will never be accepted by a free and decentralized economy. 
These competing forks will wither and die... whether it takes months, years, decades or centuries. They are built on foundations of sand.
Once you recognize this fact, there is nothing else to contemplate or fear.

Sorry, miners don't decide much of anything. You can dig a hole anywhere in the desert, doesn't mean you're getting paid for it.
I'll sell my s2x coin into the ground, and any miners willing to mine such a garbage coin will quickly find they're spending more in electricity than they're making in coin. 
Then I will continue buying bitcoin, and any miner wanting to actually get paid will be there to mine and secure it.
That's how this works.

Decentralization of coin holders is the most important metric, and is one that cannot be measured accurately. 
The network of nodes is quite healthy and geographically/politically diverse.
Mining is troubling for sure, but there are signs of future improvement / and present day success in terms of game theory I.e. It doesn't matter if it's somewhat centralized.
Development is diverse, robust, and by the looks of it should be entering a period of explosive growth. You must fail to understand how open source software is developed.

The state and state sanctioned central/corporate banking apparatus are made up of individuals. The lines become quite blurred. Economic exchange is thus sponsored, controlled, and executed by individual interests who are not interested in the social good, but rather for the benefit of those in control. 
Whereas dilution of the people's dollar was once punishable by death, today it is pissed on as a matter of course.

You’re free to run your own client that does whatever you’d like it to. Likewise you’re free to use bitcoin cash, or s2x. You’re not forced to use bitcoin.

It will reduce the ability for everyday people to confirm the validity of their own bitcoin transactions.

These types of threats are good in that over time the global bitcoin community grows weary and disinterested in them. The first time a nation state actually bans Bitcoin will be a price event without a doubt, but like the ETF and hardfork it will probably only prove to be a minor bump in the road that can never be repeated for the same effect. 
I don't think China will ban bitcoin, and instead big players will seek through political pressure the banning of bitcoin in a much smaller nation.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:09:22
Zzz... The most tired and unlearned statements. Bitcoin is the most established, technologically advanced, fair, permissionless, trustless, distributed, means of digital exchange the world has ever seen and may ever see.
Anything else is less of at least one (and most likely most or all) of these.
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:56:24
More likely just traders / gamblers. No hodl power. I think we will only see consistent hodl buying from here on in China. Hence, much lower volume.

Ah. I think I see where you're coming from. I'm not really interested in identity politics, or cultural Marxism/postmoderism. While I accept that I've been blessed to be in a good position to understand this technology, I reject the premise that my skin colour or gender has anything to do with the value of my ideas or contributions to this, that, or the other. I find this philosophy to be reductionist and backwards. I really do like people like Jordan Peterson as calm and collected academic response to these sorts of radical left ideologies.

Interesting, I was told I was approaching the issue from the left by another commenter...

Perhaps like Satoshi I will choose to lose or never redeem my wealth tokens... have I not staked my meagre economic value contributing to the stabilization/solidification of a means to personally store and yield ones labour at will without the penalties of dilution/theft for those at the very bottom of the pyramid? Or are we simply talking about original sin?

I had the wallet, and it took forever to open and navigate on my iPhone at the time (slow)...

Hey Luke, the guy is talking about ease of use and security... and I assume he doesn't mean the security of the network.

How about we avoid/ignore/discount that metric altogether, as it is easily gamed by shitcoin scammers, is meaningless in the face of raging bull and bear markets, and will not have meaningful value until bitcoin is much more established as a store of value in say 100 or 200 years?

Alright. Sounds like it's your own issues of interpretation to me.
I don't particularly support or feel like Luke's recent actions and efforts to enable UASF are positive for the community or will be fruitful in the short term. But maybe they aren't meant to be? It's useful to see how many of the community are willing to push for consensus change v. strictly support the standard non-aggressive 95% miner majority take-it-or-leave-it consensus approach. Or maybe it's to stoke the fighting spirit in the hearts and minds for a future battle.
At least he's open about it. I think the man deserves respect and thanks for his work -- and he's free to work on whatever efforts he chooses to support, in the open or in the shadows.
That said, there are more subversive groups and individuals who are actually astroturfing - that is: creating fake "grassroots" movements to push political agendas purely in the shadows. So let's call things what they actually are.
@_date: 2016-10-04 12:08:31
As previously mentioned, and  in the article, removing the 10% founders reward is reason enough to turn a complete shitcoin into merely a shitcoin.

The mistake is to honestly consider them a threat. They're joke fudsters. They could fork if they wanted to if they honestly believed what they say and had any virtue. They're just loud bullies - and if they want to keep it up they'll be forked off anyway.

The system as I understand it is designed for mutual benefit and/by immutability of terms. The original segwit activation threshold ensures that there is true consensus and that the change to consensus is voluntary by those with the largest investments in the network. Bitcoin should not be about threats and extortion. This type of movement is rash and analogous to the big block movement. The protocol is working as intended and can only be damaged by rash actions such as forking off by a measurable minority.

Nothing is for certain. If they run segwit2x we might get segwit activation, and we might get a follow-up fork. What matters most is what the economic majority will accept and pay for.
They will try to convince you that a fork is for certain. They will try to convince you that the majority of hash power, businesses, and economic users support it. But it's not true. A very small group want it, and they do not have the means to force it on us. 
A hard fork is the path to centralized control, and we will reject it as a community and vote to the death with our fiat, bitcoin, and our incorruptible software network.
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:23:49

If contentious forks happen expect pandemonium for a few weeks as anyone with a brain exchanges whatever paypal shitcoin these monkeys built for free and decentralized bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-07-07 16:01:29
Yes the first and only philosophically sound apolitical distributed cryptocurrency will be replaced by ... what? 
And why again? Because there is no governance model? Because somebody had to pay some fees when there was demand on the network? Or... is it because blockchain is "old technology" now that we've copy and pasted it a few hundred times? 
Shill more, you hack.

Actually one could argue verifiable, limited, and distributed bitcoin is more real than centralized, inflationary, and arbitrary digital fiat.

Think of all the wasted energy the sun puts out.

This stinks. I use Coinbase multisig for purchasing and saving my own coin but I'm actively looking for different ways to acquire coin. This big brother shit is really tiresome and exactly the reason I want into an unconnected crypto acct. I'm an upstanding human being and I appreciate my privacy.

Not to be a dick or anything, but could you maybe watch a YouTube or read a website and learn the first thing about distributed systems and what makes them special despite their obvious limitations?

And so it goes.

If you read 3 and 4, these are not clarifying statements about segwit or hardforks. This analogy is trash, and is more confusing than helpful. I'm tired of this hack being "one of the good guys" -- because he isn't.

I just don't worry or care about ETH. 
Just because people are willing to pay for something doesn't mean it has any more true relative value to something else. I'll happily continue to throw a small amount of savings into bitcoin at a relative discount due to its distraction...
ETH has far too many moral and philosophical flaws to ever challenge bitcoin in any serious way as a financial alternative to government issued money.. such as lack of immutability, scam ICOs (90% or more), incredible premine, centralization issues re development, poor technical and philosophical vision (E.g. Proof of stake is a flawed centralizing crony capitalistic force) oh and the fact that it isn't even really meant to exist as a competing currency...

@_date: 2017-07-17 16:07:09
The FUD strong these days...  
But regardless, generally major corrections like this are a great reminder that we can't get ahead of ourselves. It wipes out the weak and over-leveraged like a brush fire allowing for longer term hodlers and new entrants a healthy time to amass coin and acts like a spring board for the next leg up.
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:52:01
What. This was caused by small immature markets. They tend to bubble and pop.

It could fail if it becomes centralized.
There seem to be many forces looking to take control by "firing" those who work on the open source bitcoin project. 
The same people, or others, seem to be pumping alternate currencies for profit, and for mind share. They call bitcoin "broken" or "dead". If you obfuscate and muddy the true purpose of the technology and get enough people scared or confused, you disrupt/destroy potential adoption. I don't think this would destroy it though.
