It makes me feel like i'm part of a movement. Part of that might be happiness.

there is no way it was actually him that wrote that. it actually sounds coherent.

How does Bitcoin **give** privacy? I mean it's an open blockchain, if anything it makes spending habits easier to track.
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:18:49
oh ok, i'm not well informed on those specific mechanisms.
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:32:24
not your keys, not your crypto
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:42:32
Nice. We need more adoption!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:17:56
yeah but I got it back in 2013 so...
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:17:18
every time i watch it gets funnier
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:47:51
damn voice recognition. editing
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:53:21
might transfer it into Dash or Lumens, we'll see
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:53:27
i do.
only 0.02 but it counts and i'm still laughing

bitcoin is just the beta version of cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens is the real MVP

well good thing it's only trebled and not quadrebbled, or quintrabliukehffbalfblawhed

i hope it drops to $10

This is apples and oranges though. The budget of a sovereign country that issues its own currency cannot be looked at the same way as a household budget is. Something that a lot of people need to understand about a modern monetary system is that taxes do not fund spending. Sounds counterintuitive I know, but it's the truth. Taxes collected are simply deleted. New money is issued simply with the click of a button. There's nothing inherently wrong with this system, it works quite well actually, what I would like to see is it done within a cryptocurrency.

What grandma was talking about when she said she "bought some Bitcoin". ��
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:25:28
Doesn't exactly look like the one I've used before but yeah that's what they do, sell you coin at a higher rate as part of their "fee". Your right, it's nuts. I've been looking for a better way to buy coin without using an ATM, but without relying on my bank either as they tend to decline the transactions.
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:52:16
That's nothing, have you seen what Black Frog ATMs do?
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:31:15
In the process
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:25:26
Not everything is a scam. 
Some are scams, most are just worthless immitations; a handful are great innovative technology: like Stellar, Iota and Cardano.
@_date: 2019-08-01 13:08:20
now this is what we need more of in r/bitcoin. Adoption!
@_date: 2019-08-21 19:27:12
is it just me or does it look like the spikes in price actually *don't* correlate with halving events, contrary to what is commonly stated?
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:38:17
no. no, you are most certainly **not** the only one.
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:18:37
@_date: 2019-10-08 23:30:57
Do you have an example of "cashflow assets"
@_date: 2019-08-21 19:38:18
this doesn't make any sense

bitcoin hits new ATH
*flips monitor*
bitcoin hits new ATL
@_date: 2019-08-22 16:37:58
correct, it's a statement.
@_date: 2019-02-27 16:09:03
why is ETH just the logo? doesn't seem fail. 
Should add Stellar, IOTA and Cardano
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:47:59
Wrong, bitcoin is currency, or have you not been paying attention?
@_date: 2019-02-11 01:35:36
actually it's **not** illegal because the stamp is mostly in the white space so the bills are still considered fit for reissue. It's only illegal if they were damaged beyond usability, or the stamp were advertising a business, then it would be an illegal act. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 01:44:35
Gotta keep reading dumbass ;)


@_date: 2019-06-19 00:48:04
Ah ok, thanks
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:06:43
i hope i'm wrong
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:40:00
yep, at Tuttle Crossing Mall in Dublin OH USA  
If you're depositing fiat less than $250 there is a flat fee of $10
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:43:26
also seems like it's kinda leveling off

i feel like there's a story behind this. Please, enlighten us?

underrated comment
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:14:16
Maybe, when the price spikes to 20,000 again
@_date: 2018-11-30 04:27:19


@_date: 2018-11-22 14:41:37
Uh, no. I said "fuck racism".
One can hate racism and that shithole Gab, but still think they should be allowed free speech.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:17:00
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:06:30
Did I suggest otherwise?
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:10:18
Fuck racism
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:40:13
So...this mean's McAfee is going to eat his own dick?
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:40:55
No, I just don't like racism, and while Gab is a hot bed of it, they're free to continue existing any adopt whatever payment system they want.
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:11:11
That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works.
@_date: 2018-11-24 10:17:55
Stands for "shitcoin"

@_date: 2018-11-22 13:38:50
Cool, this is 10 minutes away from me
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:16:22
Nah, just what I left in Bitcoin after I converted about $600 worth to Stellar, IOTA, and Cardano
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:18:09
I try
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:50:10
But I don't want the bull run to happen yet, I haven't had a chance to buy in enough
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:59:13
no it's not
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:18:43
I got more, in other currencies though
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:34:36
well they've associated btc addresses to those two people, but that doesn't mean they can prevent transactions from taking place. All these people would have to do is use a privacy coin like Zcash shielded addresses or Monero and and then there is nothing the gov can do. 
To be clear: they're **not** preventing transactions from happening, they connected btc addresses to real people and are taking actions against (or maybe just threating) those people, in real life. No government can force a decentralized network like bitcoin offline.
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:06:24
Just hang on to it, it'll be very useful again once the Bitcoin price drops back down to $5
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:18:59
That's the plan
@_date: 2018-11-09 01:58:34
there's one near me that uses BTC, BCH, and LTC. since litecoin is the lowest priced, litecoin is currently at $50 I can turn cash into ltc at a rate of about $60. that's how they make their money: inflate the rate. sucks but not nearly as bad as your atm.
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:41:08
so i'm not going to be able to buy cheaper than 3200 :(
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:09:39
riiiiight, don't think the moon has anything to do with it...beyond memes anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-09 01:31:51
that price is insane! There is no way i would use that. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 23:36:26
that's not a "trade" that's a purchase.
@_date: 2019-01-17 21:44:07
me, you're talking about exactly me. I should have been more of a nerd
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:10:07
i hope you're right
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:57:50
Yep, got about a dollar worth of BNB sitting out there.
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:56:48
he's wrong, and he knows full well he's wrong
@_date: 2018-11-29 11:34:01
Is this a bull run?
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:05:09
I will probably go well above 20K I just don't think it'll be soon. I'm not John McAfee thinking it'll be a million in a year. 75K in the next 5 years isn't unrealistic.
@_date: 2018-11-30 04:25:44
that's obviously not the method i was talking about, and i'm not disputing it
@_date: 2019-01-24 00:49:03
Here is what you need
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:20:59
this is great, sharing
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:30:27
on a storefront. get the owner's permission first of course. Teach them about bitcoin. Create the adoption, then let the sticker drive it.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:37:28
nice job OP!!
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:05:21
this guy bitcoins
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:01:59
there will be no humans by 2140
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:28:29


that's exact reason I'm not driving a Lambo right now
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:19:24
wait wait wait....did you use your bitcoin to buy hookers and then spend most of the available time teaching them about bitcoin?! so meta.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:54:02
~~flesh~~ silicon
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:26:56
june 2022?! did i miss something? what year is it?
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:55:36
What about bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto aka Craig Wright?!?!  
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:00:04
$2900 here we come
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:14:29
OMG yes please!!! this would be great!!!
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:42:52
I did the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:20:03
NO!! I'm not ready yet, wait till i get my tax returns
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:36:24
As much as I hate this guy, I like seeing the adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:41:49
I'm a hodler but although I don't sell back for fiat, I will use BTC (and others) for purchasing goods and services. I would say actually using crypto is a more powerful driver than just holding to promote adoption.
