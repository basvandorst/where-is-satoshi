Holy shit old timer I'm prepared to increase my stash by 10fold I'd be able to afford so many bitcoins at 1k I'd BTFD hard af

Hmm you love PayPal and moneygram? Those are a pain in the royal ass. GTFO no-coiner boomer

Holy shit this makes logically sense right here. Imma go inject more creatine into my veins and memorize this and put it into my attack arsenal when someone talks shit

How can we be in the early stages at $6500. This is mind blowing me. I understand because it's impossible for me to send money to family in another country by myself I have to use moneygram/3rd party. I get the technology is revolutionary but maybe I'm looking at price wrong? 
Maybe 1 Bitcoin is worth a lot more than I thought idk. 
Edit: realizing this S curve exponential theory was not a meme...fackme

8 months ago I bought the peak 
- buy high sell high 
- buy and never sell 
- buy and sell to anyone for a product/service because everyone accepts bitcoin as preferred payment

Holy shit dopamine dump

Doesn't seem like I'm early but on time 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:43:33
Hmmm. Covered this guy in college extensively.  Free market capitalism. Didn't see this video. Didn't buy bitcoin. Still poorfag. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:51:51
Doesn't it have to hit a ceiling eventually? Once we crush through 100k is it really going to crush 100k again and then go to million? I mean it has got to end eventually
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:55:18


Everything is great right.. /s

*TenX Co-Founder, Julian Hosp **PRAYS** Bitcoin Goes to $60,000 Real Soon*
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:48:55
Demand for bitcoin more so because of the technology behind it not so much because of the work it takes to mine one/it's rare?

Did you miss the boat and now you want to complain about it huh? Yes, of course you did. We did a x40 and went from $30B (which took 9 years) to $800B in less than a year, had the mass media reporting about it, every fucking normie jumping into altcoins, but 'it's still early!'. Get real. If you didn't catch the train this time, you probably missed your chance to get rich. Might make a bit of money, but making it to a million? What do you expect the market cap to do? Do another x40 and go to 20 trillion in the next year? Even that might not be enough for most of us to 'make it'. And where should that money even come from? Normies have already come, and they have already gone. Everything is fucking priced in. Not a single coin in the top 200 will do more than x20 at best in the next 2 years. While you could get multiple x100 and even x1000 in the last year. Fucking get real, delusional person. You missed the opportunity of your lifetime. Get over it and start living your life and stop posting bullshit like you just did on Reddit wasting everyone's time. 
Truth is you'll miss the next boat too.

Explain exponential and why 
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:46:41
What happens then? 
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:54:00
100% unknown amount of monero. Like I said, get real.
