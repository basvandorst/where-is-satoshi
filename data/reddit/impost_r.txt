Ok so we know that 1Cgct2JutAiVs2VotVHdDfx6E1DThu2ruf is the thief.
ba151395f583231a4a265372fe13b6bdc0ab3547eef50a8caf63b138ea9c2305 is a 0.001 BTC transaction from the thief's wallet to 14Juwk5ZXiRfQ635nWoL86Tg38zojLLgr1, what looks like a tumbler, I can't identify which one, could also be some other service used for mixing funds, what I do know it lots of activity receiving and sending btc to darknet markets from the entity that controls that address.
The change from that transaction goes to 1CofjuN7aeGUeUjLp5WFhqGotuBqKqZWMU. He sends 1.8 BTC to the same 14Juwk5ZXiRfQ635nWoL86Tg38zojLLgr1 address. This a day before receiving the stolen 40 BTC.
The 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 incoming BTC transaction all look like they come from BTCGUILD. OP you you should contact them.

They automatically identify addresses as part of a wallet. If the wallet belongs to a website that sells marijuana seeds that's how they did it.

Maybe the police let them know? (Easy to see its a coinbase address if it receives money from their hotwallet for example)

The blockchain is not anonymous my friend, addresses especially in an exchange follow predictable behaviour. We have to wait until the coins move again to see whether they can be tracked (most likely not if the thieves know what they're doing)

That is my post, correct. If you use multiple withdrawal addresses it gets way harder for someone like me to de-anonimyze your transaction, it might still be possible with some smart coding but not as accurate, bitcoinfog wallets are easily identifiable after all. 
My main point about tumblers(so this argument is actually moot) is you don't know who is behind them, it could be law enforcement for all you know. Additionally we have never seen a takedown of a tumbler, this while most of them knowingly advertise their darknet market use and thus making them 100% illegal. A tumbler would be a perfect honeypot for LE, and some probably already unknowingly are. 
Also, a tumbler after coinbase will eventually just get you suspended for sending money to a tumbler(if coinbase adds tumblers to their list of no-nos).
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:50:49
That's just a troll, anyone can create a bitmessage id, he didn't prove ownership of the address.

@_date: 2015-01-29 03:45:13
Then why bother with tumblers in the first place? A clearnet bitcoin casino like all the dice games won't give up your user details either (they're already operating illegally). Use multiple if you want to play it safe. 
Or go on an exchange and get some anonymous altcoins, move around, deposit back on another exchange and convert back to btc. There are so many ways to tumble your coins but people are just lazy and use bitcoinfog/Helix etc. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:04:08

Still doesn't discount the possibility that the tumbler is either run or compromised by LE, if people can get access to the servers of SR, BMR, MtGox, BTC-E, Bitstamp etc. why would a tumbler be any different? In fact, Bitblender did get compromised before. If LE got access to the server they could bypass tor in order to get the server IP, from there on they know the physical location and could start physically monitor the server without the admin ever finding out(especially if it's a VPS). 
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:43:33
It's way more advanced than blacklisting specific addresses, when there's a good implementation of and good incentive for using coinjoin they won't be able to pull it off anymore though.

Yep that's my point, people treat tumblers as magic black boxes that make their problems go away. 
Even if they provided a foolproof method of tumbling you don't know who is behind them, it could as well be LE. And if a hacker can compromise bitblender you can be damn sure LE can as well, and they would have no incentive to take the server down as they wouldn't have an incentive to do so.

This has more to do with the application not being able to handle the traffic than the server.
@_date: 2018-06-21 08:50:22
Yes he could, but they're likely using an anonymous VPN provider so the hosting provider of the service will receive the abuse notification, and the service chose that specific hosting provider precisely because they're lenient, so nothing will happen. Either that or it is a compromised box being misused, but even on the off chance that the ISP/hosting provider cares, they will just use one of their other compromised boxes.

Baltimore LE did know about the account before the 7393.49 BTC theft on May 6th 2013.
Mt. Gox lawyer contacted "AUSA-2 in USAO-Baltimore" because that account had raised supicion, they never got a reply. Mt. Gox never forwarded them those details until after the arrest of Ulbricht, but using blockchain analysis LE could've figured out which addresses were involved with it, the 40k bitcoin withdrawal was pretty visible, if they had googled the address they would have found the kohlanta bitcointalk post.
