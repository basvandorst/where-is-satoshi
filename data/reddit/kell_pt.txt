They have phone support? I thought it was only by email? I sent 0.023 BTC almost 2 hours ago and it went in fine after the usual 6 confirmations.

It'd seem to me that a company that is sitting in millions in reserves will have a better way to monetize than doing the simple and stupid stuff of selling data. There's many other ways, when money is involved. :)

It's fine that there's hardcore Bitcoin fans out there, I get it. But the rest of the world couldn't care less about this great new technology, unless someone makes it easier to use.
Recording MP3s on CDs WAS a large part of getting them adopted. It didn't mean you were stupid: it just meant you didn't have better/cheaper alternatives for storing them. Sure, it was a transient thing, but it was useful, and a lot of us still have CDs stacked with MP3 in their cars.
It allowed people to say "now I can hold 10 albums on a CD". Sure, it was not revolutionary: it was **evolutionary**.
Seems like all these services are doing precisely that. Bridging the gap between something revolutionary and regular people, creating something a lot of people can use.
IMHO, this gets us closer to actually making Bitcoin mainstream. It may mean that in 10 years the need for such a service has subsided, but we'd all be smart at looking at this in a positive light. At the very least, it raises Bitcoin's profile.
So, I'm not sure I'll be using it myself, but I'm at least happy to see it attempted.

As far as I understand, they actually turn bitcoin to dollars/whatever, and hold those in reserve.

The difference seems to be that besides sending bitcoin, you can also just send those dollars to anyone as actual dollars.

That's wicked logic. First, how could we expect to have the benefits of SEPA transfers, unless the entity is following EU law?
Second, a good portion of EU law exists to protect consumers, so why would I choose to go to an exchange that doesn't follow the law? To me, the fact that they're doing this - annoying as it might be - serves as a reminder that they're trying to do things properly.
IMO, anyone lawfully moving these amounts of money should be happy they're doing this. :)

great dodge! :)

Seems like it'd be the case where you can send bitcoin to any address outside their cloud, or send "bitcurrencies" to any user inside their cloud for free. Sounds interesting, now we wait and see.

Totally agree - let's not lump everyone together.

You might be surprised to learn this, but banks lose money all the time. They get hacked, transactions diverted, etc. Because they are not subject to this level of public scrutiny, they never suffer from the public backlash.
This zero tolerance approach is not without its merits, but it needs to be tempered with watching how they react and how things evolve.
That said, I for one, always questioned the soundness of keeping 200k BTC in a single address. Sounds retarded to me, particularly one that is single-sig, when we've had multi-sig addresses for years. But hei, noone complained when they did their "proof of reserve", so the whole bitcoin community is at stake here. :)
If you're not going to trust them again, let it not be because they failed, but because this kind of failure highlights a severe lack of knowledge on the tenets of bitcoin security. Blockchain.info, on the other hand, manage to did everything right for a long time, and had a small slip, which is 0.1% the size of Bitstamp's.

When did we start turning bitcoin into a religion?

I don't understand the response from timparsa below. As far as I can tell from their AMA, selling/buying is precisely what they do.
