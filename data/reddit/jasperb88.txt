Any tips on how to collect your forked coins if you only have the BTC core wallet?
Edit: o nevermind, anything other than bcash is pure shit and worth almost nothing. Not worth playing around with your btc private keys to get some trash coin and risk your actual BTC.

@_date: 2019-06-27 11:41:24
Moon Boys.. thinking BTC will just rise and rise without consolidation. Have you learned nothing since the last major bull run?
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:02:17
Lol btc is overbought atm, gonna pullback tomorrow
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:09:11
Problem is it was 8days in a row and on the weekly the mfi is 92. We've been overbought for 10 weeks now. We gonna consolidate over the coming week.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:04:57
Strap yourself in, it's overbought on weekly and daily. We gonna consolidate for a few days before we go up
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:08:00


Thats not true at all.. I have upgraded to new versions many times over the years, it doesn't overwrite your old wallet.dat file. You made a mistake somewhere.
Anyway glad you had a backup.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:53:08
Btc is way overbought atm, gonna fall back again tomorrow / Wednesday
@_date: 2019-10-02 12:41:09
99% of people are here to make money and get rich. If you say otherwise, you're lying.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:44:01
ok, so if you go to any site that provides you with charts e.g  One of the indicators you can turn on is the MFI (Money Flow Index). 
The basics of it is when the MFI is above 80 it is overbought and if it is below 20 it is oversold. So when the MFI is over or under these values for a long period, you almost always (99% of the time) get a pull back to consolidate. Consolidation is not necessarily a bad thing, it is actually very healthy. We need this instead of just shooting straight up or down.
It is way better to gradually go up, consolidate and then go up again. If you shoot straight up you normally get a severe pull back, like last night when we dropped 2k in a few minutes.
Lastly if you think the MFI and all of this jazz is bullshit you can always look at the last 10 years of BTC and see that this is true. 
MFI meaning below.
"The Money Flow Index (MFI) is an oscillator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure. Created by Gene Quong and Avrum Soudack, MFI is also known as volume-weighted RSI. MFI starts with the typical price for each period. Money flow is positive when the typical price rises (buying pressure) and negative when the typical price declines (selling pressure). A ratio of positive and negative money flow is then plugged into an RSI formula to create an oscillator that moves between zero and one hundred. As a momentum oscillator tied to volume, MFI is best suited to identify reversals and price extremes with a variety of signals. "
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:31:44
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:52:04
not sure if you're sarcastic but you can check yourself on [Tradingview.com]( just turn on the MFI and check the charts
@_date: 2019-02-10 11:10:19
some guy you never heard of said the price will go up. There saved you time
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:31:19
lol moon boys, thinking BTC will just rise and rise without consolidation. It's 10weeks overbought last time this happened was Dec17. We will consolidate before we go up again.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:36:18
The pullback is gonna rek a few people. BTC hasnt been this overbought since Dec17. I'm sure we will see new ATH in the next few months but we will have a consolidation period.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:36:12
like that pullback now?
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:44:22
I'm 100% bullish on btc and we're in a bull market but we will definitely pull back a bit in the next few days. Btc hasnt been this oversold on the weekly chart since Dec 2017.
@_date: 2019-06-09 14:10:10
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:32:35
Look at btc chart over the last few years and tell me where the MFI was wrong. I'll wait.

I would say 9-10k. Weekly has been overbought for 10 weeks now, MFI sitting at 92.
MFI has never been wrong in 10years worth of data. We need to consolidate before we go up again.

I do all my online shopping for games in bitcoin on kinguin.com because my sneaky filthy bank charges me 2.7% of the transaction value when I use my card online(merchants not in my country). 
I even paid with bitcoin the other day for some locally made chilli sauce in my country. So where ever I can I pay in bitcoin.
Check them out if you like chilli sauce.  I think they ship world wide and you can pay with btc.

at this very moment you're selling btc for R97 501, luno is selling at R99 124. plus with you guys you need a minimum of R50k. ( not worth the hassle to buy from you if you're only cheaper by les than 1%)
And you ask 5% withdrawal fee in ZAR? Luno asks R8.50
