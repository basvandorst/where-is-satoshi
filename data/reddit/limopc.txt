This is weirdest, most arrogant, most rude I have ever seen...
Go ahead ... ban me..
I was so enthusiastic about bitcoin... but it’s over... for me.. even if 1 Btc increases a million pct a month
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:34:22
Just to comment on yours, I never say no just to be in opposition and be noticed... I take everything seriously and scientifically... I discuss, read think analyse... feel free to read my sub Reddit’s or topics... you will know what I am saying.
So, the main idea is big boys (banks, Amazon, Apple...etc) are in with millions of BTC
Do you think banks would do that? They are anti BTC. Why would amazon or Apple do that?
How could LN be implemented in real life?
Who is adopting BTC and most of the people have open channels with? Apple? HP? These are not the type of business that you need an open channel with all the time...
Telephone operators? Banks? Pizza Hut? KFC? The bus service? This would only happen if the take BTC as a payment method/currency 
Any further explanation would help.
P.S. the immortal question, when would LN be available for “normal” users through their wallets? Till now I found nothing but “soon”! How soon is soon?
Sorry, no offense, but I am still having the feeling that developers have their own world.. hope they prove me wrong
Anyway hope you tell me more re. above questions.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:47:14
I ... mmm so, it depends on “luck”, if the other user is using it and has an open chanel with someone I have an open Chanel with, and if that someone has only 0.5 BTC then the other two can’t send 2 BTC!?
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:02:31
u/pilotavery 
So, I must find out what a user has open channels with first, and when someone opens a channel he should never close it, how many channels you can keep open? For how long?
Edit: Having a downvote... still looking for a real respectable person to say why he is downvoting... ah.. I know... because I didn’t say “yes sir!”... LN is amazing sir... LN will make 1 BTC worth 10 Millions sir... currently it should be worth a million sir...
SHIT Sir! ������

@_date: 2018-01-01 11:06:17
Here is the problem... no answers ... even roughly
People or investors need a concrete answer... q2 2018, August 2018, Summer 2018...
Till now not even a rough estimation!
Investment is based on calculation, even rough estimates would do... but... absolutely nothing, investors would prefer something they can calculate...  else it is even worse than gambling... even gambling can be calculated...
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:28:57
OP, are you blaming BTC adopters for adopting BTC? 
It is them who caused  transaction fees to increase because they are too many?
It is them who caused delays because they are too many?
Am I missing something?
Better discuss and explain rather than downvoting my posts!
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:25:09
Sorry for typo, I mean Segwit not Segwit2x

Please quote (copy/paste) where does the link say Segwit2x support!
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:16:01
Unfortunately this is how developers see things... if it is what they think then it’s right... anything else is wrong... if they see today is Friday... then the whole world is wrong if they say it is Sunday!
I gave up on BTC because of them... no matter what
Go ahead... downvote as usual..
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:50:34
Thanks u/ayanamirs 
I already have ny BTC in Bread, and have my 12 word mnemonic phrase. All addresses are of course non Segwit and start with 1.
Now I have bitWallet installed, which allows me to create a Segwit wallet. If I restored using the 12 word mnemonic phrase of Bread, I will be having a copy and all addresses with balances all non Segwit and starting with 1.
If I used the Segwit wallet and send BTC, would it be a Segwit transaction or a normal high fee transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:47:58
Thanks u/ayanamirs, 
You are the only one who gave me an answer ... here, several reddits and even bitcointalk,
I better keep my BTC in Bread and just use the Segwit bitWallet for new bitcoins. I am mainly holding for long long time.
So, thank you very much for your guidance.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:13:45
Sorry if this has been answered before... but I couldn’t find the answer, all was about possibility of sending from Segwit to non Segwit address, or the transaction fees or speed of both.
My question is, I just installed bitWallet, which I assume supports both Segwit and non Segwit. I have my BTC in Bread which is a non Segwit, so all my addresses start with “1”, non Segwit.
If I created a new Segwit wallet in bitWallet, and restored with my 12 word seed phrase (from Bread wallet), would it go in the new wallet as a Segwit or non Segwit address, in both cases when I send BTC from the new bitWallet to any other BTC address whether Segwit or non Segwit, would I benefit from the speed and cost of Segwit?
I hope I made my question clear, and hope to get an answer.
By the way, what is the average, normal, or mostly... transaction fee in USD (given the current price roughly) and speed of transaction?
Thank you.
P.s. I posted this question somewhere else before finding this topic.
I hope someone experienced especially with iOS bitWallet can give us an answer
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:28:46
You are right
Furthermore, the developers have their own mind
They think they are the community, they decide... even though bitcoin is money or an asset, they see it is just software, ignoring sciences of investment, business, economics,... for them it is just software
They don’t even discuss with users about the “software”, they just discuss with themselves only.
This is absolutely the opposit of the idea of open source software 
This is why the developers are destroying bitcoin
I had many posts that was downvoted because I tried to discuss and not just saying “yes sir!”
Edit: as expected, downvoted. This proves I am right. Downvoters better discuss rather than proving my point by downvoting
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:35:32

How you distinguish it is a bot? Why not a trader placing multiple orders?

Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:53:21
Thanks a lot u/MothyPap
So, let them stay as they are... only new BTC will be withdrawn to a Segwit address...
Hopefully developers would succeed with lightning network and it makes a change...
I am mainly holding long term... but honestly I have diversified to some other cryptos..
Thank you very much for explaining.. sorry.. I am not that techie

Later on it would be just a correction after bosting to 13000 down to 11000, then a correction after boosting to 12000 down to 10000, then a correction after boosting to 11000 down to 9000....
As long as I insist there is no problem... then there is no solution.. 90% of solving the problem is recognising and admitting it exists... the rest is easy

Would I save if I send from nonsegwit address from a segwit wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:51:34
The problem in my view... developers are on their own... they don’t listen... they believe they are the community.... users have to say nothing but “yes sir!”
This is the danger I see to bitcoin...
I know this will be downvoted... I’ve been there... and probably get banned...

Ok, when it comes to the new wallet to the same non Segwit address, would sending from bitWallet to any other address be a Segwit transaction or a normal high cost transaction?
P.s. I prefer not to sweep and pay ridiculous fees...
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:15:50
Thanks again u/MothyPap
I understand a bit about addresses and wallets, but I am still missing something.... sendinding from a non Segwit address from a Segwit wallet, will be treated as a Segwit transaction with low cost?
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:29:11
Hi guys, I just want to suggest a title to this topic instead of “already burst” to be “previously burst and recovered, and now bullish” or something similar. The article says in the end that “a Bitcoin bubble has already burst recently, but it recovered and....”
“So, the unclear aspect of these normal changes is not whether Bitcoin is a bursting bubble or not. It is a fact, a Bitcoin bubble has already burst recently, but it recovered and now the famous digital coin behaves like bullish currencies have always behaved: with confidence.”
Just to be sure the title doesn’t scare investors or holders.

The main point I would like to discuss here is:
“All what I want to say in this post, BTC developers, please, you are doing a great job, but again, I said it before in in “introducing myself”, please expand the community, include experts in all fields, and listen to them, I am not saying “obey” them, I am just saying understand what experts and community says and suggest.”
I would like to hear from everybody, and hopefully from developers.
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:05:21
What you say is true to a great extent.
I am into bitcoin myself, but my personal experience, feeling soooo confident that you ALWAYS win all the wars, you ALWAYS pass the exams.... you ALWAYS.... this is a serious risk, this is the first step and reason to lose the war... there “was” the Roman Empire,the Persian, the pharaonic, Netscape, AOL, Hotmail (was the one and only).... no need to explain further....

Dear u/MadSeaturtle 
Unfortunately I’ve been posting... and posting.... nobody listens or even seriously discuss...
Just read some of my threads and let me know what you think
 (I asked them to listen... not to me, to the community, I warned about more and more forks to come)
 (it was labelled low quality)
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:30:52
Thanks computer science man, it’s ok, I don’t really care about downvoting or up voting, what I care about is having a better BTC, a better life for everybody on the planet, as an economist I would love to see a world with no inflation, a world where you do not lose purchasing power because you are saving, a world where middle men don’t take a percentage from your expenses for just letting you spend your own money, or a worker transferring money to support his family back home pays a big percentage to do so.
By the way, my son just started computer science at university..
So, I am committed to suggest -as I did with my son- do your best as an IT guy to understand blockchain technologies, it’s application in business, it has many applications, it will be like database programming in the 80s, or internet technology in the 90s... blockchain technology will be the backbone of business and industry as internet and email are/were.
Glad you talked frankly. Glad to communicate with you. Feel free to say anything (even against me) or any suggestion / question.
The future for Bitcoin specifically is very promising as an investment on the other hand.
Don’t say “I'm no expert either, so my feedback is no good”, I believe you have to and you should say whatever you think, whatever you believe, even if it is wrong, someone may correct or discuss, this is the way people learn. As far as my personal experience, making mistakes is the best way to learn.
Thanks and keep in touch.

When is it expected? Roughly.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:43:14
In my first post “introducing myself”, I think my last post there I said expect more forks to come, simply because they believe they are the community.
The problem is with the congestion of the network in the first place.
I don’t feel ok with BTC failure... I really wish it goes back to normal as before
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:00:50

@_date: 2017-11-12 04:08:30
Thanks for your feedback 
Honestly, I feel and see that the developers -with all due respect- though it is open source (community), believe that the community is only the developers.
Feel free to check my first post “introducing myself”, you will easily understand what I’m talking about.
The problem is that they are not really applying the “soul” of open source software.
Sorry, I mean no offense to anybody, but it hurts me to see a great job failing for a trivial matter. 
I am saying this because I care.. else I won’t be wasting my time writing here.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:27:12
But where is lightning network? Nobody from the developers is giving the users of bitcoin even a hint about when it is expected...

I am suspicious BTC will survive... this is what I said at the beginning of this thread, but still hope someone tell me (with a link) that unconfirmed transactions are being confirmed.
The problem is not in the price, it is in the network. No network confirmations= no BTC

“MASSIVE price manipulation”
Sorry, price manipulation is usually done in penny stock, small stock, as this is a market as the stock exchange it is almost impossible to manipulate, the manipulator will lose much more than what he gains.
As BTC in circulation in millions, value in billions, it is impossible to manipulate.
Someone experienced with the stock market can confirm what I am saying or more than welcome to prove I am wrong.

You are right. Sure bitcoin is great, but I am really worried because it lacks wha you mentioned.
If someone developed something similar but faster and cheaper.... ouch... though bitcoin is still the “gate” for other cryptos, which is a very good safety point.... but still... all the missing aspects should be addressed... 
I have no problem for paying 5 USD for a transaction... because I’m not using it as currency yet... if my second paragraph above happens... we should seriously consider the consequences

I told you remember this post... 
Transaction costs are much cheaper now... but this is not helping BTC
It comes out that BTC became a shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:34:35
My point of view, technically, bitcoin or other cryptos are not a currency (by definition) yet. It is more like a gold or silver bullion. I am talking absolutely technically, though I wish cryptos become currencies. Some people might not like what I am saying, but again, I am talking absolutely technically economics, why:
1- still you have to pay money to spend or even keep it. Money should be just spent without costing you money. So, it is like storing or spending gold bullion. You have to buy a safe, ensure it, gold shop takes commission to convert it, etc.
2- it is technically a bit difficult for some people to understand and use, I mean some illiterate uneducated people mostly in some third world countries, in poor villages will have difficulty installing a wallet, understanding the 12 word key, the password,... etc, plus they are unbanked initially, so they have no way to buy or sell bitcoins. While using a fiat currency is as simple as putting your hand in your pocket and just spend.
3- currently it is like investing in gold a few years back, (only for the people who can handle it, not for everybody yet), an asset that hedges against inflation (though cryptos theoretical and mathematically appreciate more than inflation).
4- it is different from shares, absolutely different, depends on how you see investing in shares. If you invest in shares for dividends and income that grows with time, bitcoins does not give dividends. If you invest in shares hoping it’s value will increase over time, then bitcoin is like shares, but with a difference, share price depends on lots of external and internal variables, including company performance, profit and loss , budget, .. etc. Bitcoins, have no balance sheet, profit and loss, budget as a company.
It is now at a stage that is simply like a gold bullion.
To be clear, I don’t care about crypto politics or fights, I don’t really believe in or defend a specific economic theory or school.
I believe economics as a science is just a science, exactly same as physics, there is no Austrian physics, Keynesian physics, socialist physics, capitalistic physics, it is just physics... mmm economics, it is just like every one descrybing the part he sees. Like the old saying of several blind people around a huge elephant, everyone will describe only the part he “sees” or feels in front of him. Nobody is wrong (though they can be) but the elephant as... the sum of all what they “see”, and consider, we may be missing some below the elephant, some above the elephant.

They can buy Satoshi instead of bitcoin!
How come is a bottle of say Pepsi at 1 USD cheaper than a carton of 12 same bottles at 12 USD.
If they think this way they are not investors, they have nothing to do with investment. Simply because what investors do all the time is just “calculating” anything and everything.
With all my respect. No offense.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:40:58
I will be glad to help.
Just ask.

@_date: 2017-10-09 09:09:05
Ok, definetly I didn’t mean to say that programmers should only listen to others. What I was really saying is there should be a 2 way dialogue. Bother sides listening and talking to each other.
What do you mean by the society should be asking them? Asking them what, or why you doing this this way? Or asking them to do this and that? 
Whatever your answer is, I believe both types of “asking” from both sides is what is called dialogue, provided that a question asked should have an answer. This the way I believe should be done.
Nobody dictates what he wants the other to do, “discuss” what should be done and how. To reach mutually the best what and the best how.
Just curious and for the sake of constructive discussion, in your comment you said “the priority here is being anti-fragile and only then mass adoption may come.”
Who decided this priority? And how was it decided? I am not denying the idea of course.
Who concluded that being anti fragile is the thing that will bring mass adoption. Honestly I myself don’t understand exactly the meaning of anti fragile, but I am already in. Got what I am talking about?

Thanks for the warm welcome. 
Allow me to say I am not that experienced, but at least I hope I can contribute something of value to Bitcoin and crypto, I am by nature, futuristic, adventurous, curious.
Hey, don’t think I am old, yeh, by age maybe, but inside I am teen... 
I hope we can find a way for a better life.
I remember I read a book when I was a kid, On sentence changed me and my life absolutely, “I’ll find a way, or... make one”. This is my belief.

Thanks a lot. I am enjoying it here.
What I really care about is to learn and hopefully contribute something useful.
Simply it is beneficial for me. I honestly have personal interest in getting a better and better bitcoin, a better value and usability, my few dollars in bitcoins will increase in value.
Hope I am honest and clear enough.

If not try same thing with blockchain wallet.

I read the link, looks interesting. It is very true in many aspects.
The only concern -my personal point of view- it is assuming that bitcoin will completely replace the dollar, and maybe all other fiat, which is still not an expected scenario. (More in other posts)
And yes, I agree about “bitcoinization” it is the same as what happens actually in some countries.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:02:48
I’m asking about the cryptocurrency... where is it?
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:21:46
Hi, 
This story of bitcoin gold is really confusing me.
Can you explain to me what dis you mean that “you'll never know which chain you're on (nor will Bread).”
I ass assume BTC has it’s own block chain, BTG will have its own block chain.
How come no body knows?
What is meant by linking the wallet to a specific node? How to know which I am linked to! How to do it?
I have Bread and Jaxx wallets.
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:21:57
Some further clarification would be appreciated.
If facts, figures, calculations... it will help us understand more.
Any difference between a hardware wallet and a software one containing my private keys?

@_date: 2017-10-11 10:40:06
 Hope this  works!
***** This Post Is For Everybody *******
I just read 
I see, different points of view both saying the same thing, we need a better, reliable, useful, stronger ...,..., long lasting Bitcoin.
I believe the conflict is not about the goal, it’s only about how to do it.
Maybe each side sees a differen “goal” or definition of Bitcoin, maybe some see it as a digital gold bullion, some see it as a deflationary currency.
Please read what I wrote here about goal or target, about currency, ... etc.
If some sees it as gold, other see it as currency, I see no big difference. I give you the excuse, most of you opened your eyes and lived withfiat currencies, gold appreciating all the time, money is the asset, is the target. 
Listen to me carefully, (but of course you don’t have to), both parties share the same noble target, and I see:
                                                  “BTC can be BOTH, a currency, and a digital gold bullion”
BTC can be an asset to be day traded on a stock exchange and can be both above at the same time.
No, I am not crazy, I am not inventing something new.
Gold coins till mid 20th century played the role of “physical gold bullion” and money, and gold was traded on exchanges.
All it needs just a community, a real community as I experienced with Linux communities, to discuss, put definitions and targets and find out how the same target can be achieved, both sides have the same target, so, definetly not each side should have his own currency.
This is truly dangerous for both. If you got my point(s) everybody wins together more than on his own.
I am talking just as an economist, as someone holding some crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:28:51
Thanks for appreciating, but to me it is not philosophy, it is jus economics I believe backed by simple math.
I myself was a victim for long time to the socially accepted idea it is better to get rich, richer and richest possible. But my own calculations, I discovered that the problem is about having income, more income, most income.... 
Well, just my own understanding currently bitcoin is a different kind of asset, commodity, product, currency,... whatever you call it it is absolutely different from anything in existence.
As you say, and I agree with you, value is not monetized, value is something completely divergent from price, what is the real “value” of a diamond worth a million, what is the real value of air that is free, what’s the real value of a frozen chicken or bread, or a piece of chocolate. Value is one thing, price is another.
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:00:39
Yes, gold, which is a deflationary “currency” was the standard till early seventies, till the beginnings or mid 20th century there were gold coins, and banknotes were actually just for convenience and ease of handling. I have some of those banknotes, it had a statement like “I the Central Bank of Country x promise to hand over to the holder of this paper the amount of 10 Gold Coins”, so the banknote was same as gold coins.
Later on, started the mess of inflationary economics. It is a long and full of details story. But the main reason behind it, ouch... lots of reasons, but anyway, though these reasons appeared logical and can be accepted scientifically, it some how further developed to this mess, which lead to the disaster of 2008. Unfortunately the next one can be devastating. Only bitcoiners or crypto holders can be relatively safe, not 100% safe but the least affected.
Commenting on your last sentence, yes, it’s all about bout production and productivity, any government can just print money, does this make ALL the people richer, no, they still buy the same, even less with inflation. But, deflationary gold, people get richer because there is more production, and the same amount of gold gets you more of the same product. It’s about more products to be available for one, not more printed paper.
By the way,my personal opinion, bitcoin, BTC or any other crypto, will just be just another currency, not a unique global currency. Please, See other post in this regard
But rather keep this thread more focused on bitcoin economics.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:50:07
I agree with you in all what you said, especially that the less volatile BTC gets the more people gets in, but according to the common sense, and the technical definition of money, for BTC to be a day to day “money” it MUST have ALL of the following specs/aspects together:
- low volatility (which you mentioned)
- very low transaction fees or cost (you can buy absolutely anything and transaction cost would be still negligible and acceptable)
- ease of use technically (installing a wallet, backing up, 12 words, ... etc. please see the post about MIT students preferring ease of use over privacy. People need something really as simple as using cash, ATM, swiping a card)
- instant confirmed transfer (imagine at a busy supermarket, the cashier has to wait for 10 minutes to see the BTC just arrived in their account, only 3 people in front of me will cost me 40 minutes to get out)
- feeling safe and confidence I will not lose my money if my phone breaks down or lost, I can very easily and very fast get my money back, and definetly the thief will not be able to access my money... etc.
It should actually have AT LEAST ALL the features of using and storing fiat money to be a day to day currency, that is for EVERYBODY including the below average Joe, even the illiterate who hardly read and write in a third world country. We here are at  reddit are not ALL the people on the planet. 
For now BTC only has the features of investing in gold, weather physical gold or through an exchange, not yet as money.
I hope developers come in and discuss, give us feed back, other experts in banking, finance, investment, sociology... should come in and discuss.
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:01:01
I don’t think I asked anybody to do anything for me, I don’t care about the value of my credentials.
Just to be clear, I just started a few hours ago. Not 2 days.
And thanks for the welcome.
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:08:11
I see, but allow me to say, I don’t care about my credentials, all what I care about, I am reading and replying, discussing. That’s all for me.
For bitcoin, I would recommend developers would somehow find economists (not me as as I am quite busy enough), bankers, business, sociologists, statisticians to be part of the development team, even without writing code, as bitcoin weather as a currency or as an asset is not only about programming, and network security and speed, it is basically about business, economics, banking, trade,... etc. So developing bitcoin should not be only what programmers or engineers “think” about the economy, banking... etc. No offense to anybody. As mentioned, nobody understands everything about everything, this is why I am calling to include experts in all aspects of bitcoin, (and agin, not me).
A programmer, though a programmer, when developing an accounting software, listen mainly to the accountants, what they really need, what are their priorities, top aspects and features in the program, not what he thinks how it should be done. A programmer can say, I can make a program to “print” genuine banknotes, each with its own serial number and everything, he can do it perfectly. but a lawyer can explain it is illegal, an accountant or economist can explain it is not beneficial... a sociologist can give guidance on how to make bitcoin more acceptable.
For example, my understanding is that developers are focusing a lot on privacy and annonimity. Which is ok and I absolutely have no problem and support it, but.. 
For privacy, and annonimity, a scientific research by MIT states that,
Bank-like wallets, instead, connect to traditional bank accounts and credit cards, offer a mobile app, can easily convert Bitcoin to and from government-issued money, and may provide additional privacy to their users from the public because of the way they pool transactions within their network without recording each one of them on the public ledger. At the same time, with bank-like wallets users need to be comfortable sharing all their transaction data and identity information with a commercial intermediary, and possibly the government since these intermediaries need to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations like other financial institutions.
Students’ wallet choices therefore involve a trade-off in terms of who may have easier access to their financial transaction data in the future.The vast majority of participants (71%) selected a bank-like wallet and only 9% selected a wallet that is more difficult for the... 
Here is a link to the pdf 
To summarise, MIT students, above average Joe in IT, preferred convenience and ease of use to annonimity and privacy. This might give developers a hint about the “general public” priorities in crypto.
I hope it helps.
I am not interfering in any way in what developers do, or want to do, with all my due respect, I am just hoping my 2 cents can be of value.
Sorry, I absolutely didn’t want to offend anybody, or enforce any idea, it is the the developers who do the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:33:33

I would recommend bitaddress.org
1. Clear browser history.
2. Once loaded disconnect from internet, hover your mouse
3. Print public and private QR
4. Send a small amount to the public address
5. Test by only attempting to import your private address to be sure it reflects the coins you sent.
6. Send the rest of your funds to the same public address, retest. As in 5
Keep this piece of paper safe.

So, your last sentence, you don’t see “adjusting the bitcoin to serve the general public would be a good idea”
I see, and you have a point in this. So, BTC “policy” and target is not to be a day to day currency.
It is the actual current situation.
I have a feeling you are a developer. Am I right?
I will appreciate your feed back. Even in private message if you feel so.
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:51:10
Currently, as far as I can see even in the future, (assuming bitcoin or crypto became in position to be a currency by definition, please se previous comment), it will not be a global currency for all countries for everybody. Since barter trade, commodities exchanged each was like a currency by its own, maybe there was an lexchange rate” of 1 Lamb = 30 chicken, 1 chicken = 120 eggs... etc, then came gold and silver as “money” both were used, some places at some stages even used salt. Gold didn’t replace silver, later after fiat became just fiat, gold, silver, or fiat didn’t replace any of the other, EURO didn’t replace USD, or yen, USD didn’t replace GBP... etc.
Crypto  will coexist with USD, EUR, JPY, Gold, silver, aluminium...
Though still, I expect at a later stage, governments will issue their own electronic currency, just as following up with the technology, there may be a crypto USD, Crypto Euro, ... etc. Just for the convenience, they will still keep issuing (printing) crypto dollars and crypto euros..
No government can really stop the free crypto. They were complaining about p2p torrents to download music and movies, but they could not stop it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:14:13
In 5, I mean start importing (reading the QR code of the private key, the mobile wallet will go to the ledger on the cloud to read it then tell you how much BTC are there, then you confirm or cancel the import)
A mobile wallet is ok, if it keeps your private key, but for long term or large amounts you need secure backups.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:05:38
Thank you very much for clarifying this to me.
I have a bad impression about the real intentions of this bitcoin gold.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:00:15

You mean letting it be more than the 21M limit?
Are you serious?
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:27:34
Jus curious 
I need an evidence... does it really exist?
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:18:56
Well, till now it is a threat only because it is highly appreciating. Instead of putting money in banks CD, or whatever for an almost zero interest rate, or a negative interest rate (interest is less than inflation), so a portion would be definetly going to crypto.
Still, no mater what, as it is handled till now as an asset not a currency, they will still be able to print money, even digital money as I mentioned earlier, a crypto USD, a crypto EUR, a crypto JPY or whatever, just to cope with the technology and not be left behind completely.
But I see, current day banks can still deal in BTC, ETH, LTC, or whatever, and can benefit from it, now, next week, in the current economy and economics, and the current banking system. All they need is to understand and evaluate, and think, and adapt.
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:21:29
May I keep the answer for now? Well, prefer privacy to some extent. Sorry, no offense.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:44:27
Fortunately or unfortunately I am on IPad, but I was thinking something might help reduce bitcoin transaction cost.
Wha if there is somehow a standard for all crypto wallets as follows:
1. Any wallet should work as node.
2. A wallet keeps mining, all my returns can be used to pay miners, so minimise cost of transaction for me.
3. As done sometime ago, the screensaver for genetic unfolding, maybe someone can create something similar, enthusiasts can download the screen saver, when activated it puts computer resources to mining, rewards go to computer owner, lots of pros including introducing bitcoins to new people.
 Some sort of p2p mining like torrents.
IT people in particular are more than welcome to comment or discus, other contributions as well. I don’t know if any is technically possible. But anything starts with just an idea. Just start it, this is the most important.
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:00:47
Yes... it has nothing there... but talk, blogs, sites are everywhere...
It sounds so fishy for me.
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:42:04
Bitcoin is good for who understand it and use it properly, bad for who don’t understand or for those who benefit from inflationary economics, or who get part of the newly printed money.
It is good for those who want to save money, not good for those who want you not to save money but spend it and give it to them. 
It is good for everybody actually, if I have a business I would deal only with crypto, my profits/ reserves will be increasing as time passes.
P.s. I will see the video later.
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:03:42
I can see, nobody is interested in the discussion. No feedback from anybody not from developers, users, ... etc.
This is not a good sign in my opinion, there is no strong active and interactive bitcoin community. This indicates more forks to come unfortunately.
No offense for anybody.
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:53:53

To answer you, I believe my previous 2 comments have the answer?
Any further questions welcome..

So, simply, before 15 October till end November, I shouldn’t be buying, selling, sending bitcoins from anywhere to anywhere?

As I looked at the chart, you may notice that forking in Linux does not happen every couple of weeks or months, annually perhaps.
And normally as my experience, something forks men’s a new district based on the mother district, but providing new features, new functionality. Not just copying and giving it a new name.
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:40:13
As you said you bought bitcoins back in 2013, a few cents, maybe you should consider sending me only 1%
Lol... just kidding.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:49:59
Just follow up or consult your wallet or broker, maybe you need to do a simple procedure, like ticking or selecting an option in your wallet
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:27:50
Thanks, 
I understand, I am relatively new to Crypto though I was lightly reading about it since 2013, then I took it seriously second half of August, bought my first cryptos and sold a portion to get it to my bank account actually instantly 1st September..
I am so interested in crypto and Bitcoin, as an investment and as a matter of principal and beliefs, given my background in my intro.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:04:08
Now, BT1:BT2 is about 5000:870 usd
I believe this means the market has voted already for. BT1, ie. BTC
Am I right?
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:59:57
Yes, forking can happen, but not all the time. Only if there is a serious disagreemnt, I believe it is not software forking as such, it is just business, someone trying to make money.
Though, it just came to my mind, somebody might be pushed to fork, hoping this might weaken the crypto industry and dilute it, so minimise its growth, reduce the network value.
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:44:43
Let me know how it goes (if you want to). I hope I can be of help.
But try not to cash them out.
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:10:30
But... how come? The website is not working, other website asking for your seed words....
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:35:46
I 1000% agree with every single word you said.
Only the “bitcoin target”, if you mean the target price or market share.. etc, me too, it is not a point to discuss.
If by target you mean “goal”, or “destination”, or defining bitcoin’s use, why it exists, what is the reason and aim for it’s existence, I believe this is a vital point. If it is not there, there is no reason for it’s existence.
(Driving a luxury car, or a hummer, and trying to make your driving as fast as possible, and focusing on not being caught by speed cameras or police, reaching traffic light and crossing before it gets red... all this is great, BUT if you are doing it without a target, driving from point a in particular to point b in particular, to do something at point b (meeting your girlfriend, having dinner at a specific nice restaurant... ), all this very wonderful and perfect driving would be meaningless. It will just cost you fuel, mileage travelled and car consumption... and you may find yourself somewhere you don’t know, or you don’t wish to be there)
So, I believe we all, developers, users, miners, exchanges, wallet developers... care about one thing, MAKING MONEY. Period.
Or having part of our savings, investments, whatever in BTC keeps appreciating.
BTC remains existing. Not to be history, not to be AOL, or Netscape...
And again, I repeat, I said that you have a point when you say you don’t see “adjusting the bitcoin to serve the general public would be a good idea”
What you think?
I hope Redditors, whether developers, economists, bankers, bitcoiners,... give us feed back and comments.
I don’t mind any body saying I am wrong in specific points, for specific reasons.
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:25:43
My own definition, it is simply the sum of all what you own minus the sum of all your debt, and for convenience expressed in the value of only one of the assets.
So, for example, my wealth now is 1 bitcoin, or 4500 usd, or 450 chicken, though I actually own 0.5 bitcoins and 1020 USD and 990 Euro.
I can “feel” your question, being wealthy should not be the goal of anybody. The goal should be in my opinion is to generate the maximum possible continuously increasing sustainable “income”.
No matter how wealthy is anybody, theoretically if this wealth is all what he has, it will someday be depleted. But having a generated “wealth” is much better.
On a deserted island, you need a chicken a day, you have 500 chicken. So you are wealthy. Very wealthy.
What if you have  only 50 chicken, each chicken lays an egg, hatches in 21 days, grow the new hatched for 30 days till it grows to be eatable, so you have a continuous supply of 1 chicken every day forever (only 50 chicken) as compared to 500 chicken that do not “bread”
So, for me, I am wealthy only if I have enough sustainable income that covers my needs, even basics, and that grows sustainably to have better life and cover more needs. This is to me is better than having a million, and after a few years I will be left with nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:23:49
The whole thing smells fishy...
  Aagain, I repeat, I am not into any kind of politics
If someone can tell if there exists bitcoin gold or not... we need evidence
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:56:47
Well, I am not that clever with IT, but allow me to comment.
Because it is open source any body can simply and boldly copy and fork.
My experience, the key to success for BTC in particular can be summarised in two main points:
1- Building and maintaining a strong community of developers, users, services providers, a real community where everybody listens to everybody, discus, vote, decide... etc (as I have seen in Linux for some time)
2- developers should admit that bitcoin and crypto is not only about programming, software and technology only, it is basically a business model, it has to do with economics, business, finance, sociology, statistics, even psychology. So we need to add those to the community.
They can add a lot I believe.

Tell you something, uninstall, reinstall,   while you run first time I think it should ask you, create a new wallet or import an existing/old wallet, chose this and put your 12 words, and hust wait. The device must be connected to the internet.

Well, but I am with Jaxx wallet on my mobile, do I need to do anything? Or just stop sending/receiving bitcoins?
I have a few other cryptos as well in Jaxx wallet.
As I read and read, I get more “unknowing”, lost.
Any advice highly appreciated.
P.S. why “should” someone connect to node? What does it actually mean or offer? What if someone didn’t connect?
I am still hoping to receive an answer, in simple plain English, no techie stuff...

About banks, well, I take it as just they are somehow not comfortable with something new.
Just like when email started. Many people used to phone their friends “did you get my email I just sent?”, Email was not considered a document to prove anything, it is not a physical document having my signature and other party signature, I can’t take him to court based on an email, the email is nothing more than something that doesn’t really exist physically.
Then as it developed it became a real document.
Still, banks can do their part with crypto, at least allowing their clients to convert crypto into fiat to their existing accounts, and getting commissions and fees.
To lend crypto, or interest... it should be a currency, business borrow crypto to buy machines and raw materials and pay in crypto, sell their products in crypto, make profit in crypto, pay back the loan, the capital and interest in crypto. If this happens, people can have accounts with banks in crypto. But it is not the basic concept of crypto. It would be again, manipulated by banks and central banks policies.. it’s a bit complicated.

If this is what the B2X guys are saying, they are simply saying 2 things:
1- they are stealing and hijacking BTC
2- they are really .... thieves
3- they just care about making fiat money for themselves, not really improving BTC

I believe this should be a main topic to be discussed.
I hope developers, users, economists, bankers... should come in, or be somehow brought in to discuss.
I believe it is a serious and vital point.
Not privacy and anonimity in particular, everything related to bitcoin or crypto, from wallets, mining, fees, asset, currency... whatever related to bitcoins in all aspects.
I hope somebody can help.

This is a very smart question, so technical.
I guess you are an economist or at least very good with economics.
Well, crypto as a deflationary currency or an asset is not an issue. (Please see my previous comments).
No matter how we define cryptos, if it is an asset, or will become a currency, it will not replace fiat of any country. It will be just a currency of a another country called bitcoin republic, or ethereum kingdom or... ripple federation... a country on planet earth can separate and issue it’s real own fiat currency which is exchangeable with other fiat currencies.
Gold and silver were currencies, and though they were deflationary by nature, they did not cause any problem.
Money, weather fiat or crypto are just a means of exchange, just to facilitate barter trade, just an intermediary, it solve the problem of how can I buy just 2 eggs with just a portion of my live lamb.
I believe as I said, there will be inflationary fiat crypto dollar, crypto euro, crypto yen... and will be issued and “printed” by central banks as usual. Just a new technology for them, same as paying with cards, no fiat physical money actually moves.

When you start jaxx for the first time it should ask you create a new wallet or restore/import an old one, chose the second and enter your 12 words.

I have been struggling to find a way away from banksters, but no way, even buying bitcoin with my card online the website selling used to clearly charge me something like 7%.
The best way I know of is through localbitcoins.com
You simply deal directly with a seller in your country, you can make a transfer from your bank’s website or mobile app.
I hope this helps.

Well, that’s why I am here... to at least try to make a change. Actually, nobody consulted neither me nor my parents about how to setup the world... and I am not expecting anybody to consult me... I just try to find a way or make myself a way for a better life and future.
