Hey garlicoin was doing really good right before it was removed from coinfalcon, lol
@_date: 2015-12-10 06:19:25
he doesn't mention changing hard or changing efficiency and says that when the reward is halved again that miners will no longer make more then they power costs and says he doesn't know whats gonna happen then

" Since Meissner’s order was not finalized, Butterfly Labs assumed it was abandoned when he did not reply to the email notice." this guy is such a joke

Ha, why not both? Have two widgets? That's what I do.
@_date: 2017-02-22 08:15:20
hide sights hard to deal with. Its even more annoying when what needed to be done seems so easy. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:49:24
I'm sorry.
@_date: 2017-02-21 11:52:32
Like a baneling?
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:17:17
use coinbase instead?
@_date: 2017-02-22 08:19:35
If you want stability in stead of growth I guess.
@_date: 2017-02-22 08:08:33
It not really possible its kinda explained here 
also bitcoin is the legder the protocal can chage
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:49:43
its from this scene, "What are you trying to tell me, that I can dodge bullets?" "No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready,... you won't have to." 
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:47:47
If only I had enough for these small fluctuations to matter.
@_date: 2017-02-21 11:57:05
It's a nice thought when one doesn't have multiple, and that few hundred dollars doesn't really matter in the long run, so one might aswell see where the ride goes.
@_date: 2017-02-22 08:17:55
what gen bfl? I thought the early ones worked out for most . Thats why  people were so mad, they got back stabbed?
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:42:04
ah, shit
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:27:39
Not sure the grammar makes sense, with what I think you mean. Like you want some dip for your chips. too much inside meme.
@_date: 2016-06-10 23:35:48
Well you're probably wrong... but I grabbed another 100 USD of BTC anyway 
@_date: 2016-06-23 07:27:29
well could have made 90 dollar, but at least i made 20
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:49:06
Yeah prolly rebuy here soon though. I'm saving for a trip so I'm pretty tight with my money ATM and making 10% on part of it in a couple weeks is acceptable. That halvening though.
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:25:14
Man, my nerves can stand dealing with running in to bears in the wood but I can't take the stress of trying to make money off bitcoin. I bought some a while ago and would be happy with the profit where I am now but holdor , I just can expect the price going down till long after the halvening.

Hello, moon? This is dog.
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:39:35
Well all my eth is now BTC, if my Doge was worth anything I would convert that too.

Trump might get 35% and is certainly not gonna win. But this is funny, 1BTCuSdpkqAPeXCaqu2TGffbYyEa1ndu8n

just in case he lost my address here is it again.
@_date: 2019-10-05 12:10:34
Like was this just adding to a number in a ledger or was this like new bills?
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:53:46
eh, i will never be turning off my weekly auto buy.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:26:57

@_date: 2018-02-02 08:22:10
I just don't see what all the fuss is about, you still have the same amount of bitcoin. You only loose bitcoin if you don't hodl.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:03:21
maybe its you?
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:22:56
Absolutely not, they have all of the coins, 
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:32:10
used gyft for amazon and some papa johns a while ago, and their service seemed nice a quick.
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:59:59
It's not gonna just spike back up it's going to crash and stayed crashed for a while. Sell while you can still claims losses on your taxes.
@_date: 2013-08-05 12:22:55
I started with .3btc and ended with the balance that you see pretty much, and i was pay transaction fees to the networks like .6btc worth.
@_date: 2013-05-20 23:49:51
@_date: 2013-08-05 12:16:36
I started with .3btc and was up to almost 6btc at one point over like the four days that i was playing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:25:41
@_date: 2013-06-25 04:52:48

@_date: 2013-06-06 18:05:45

@_date: 2013-03-31 22:25:09
@_date: 2013-08-04 09:23:44
here have my 180 Mhashs/s
@_date: 2013-08-05 12:20:40
yes this is my only address
@_date: 2013-06-08 09:33:06
I'm gonna guess they skipped some numbers. I ordered early January this year, when did you order?
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:38:32
pretty sure they say its gonna take a week.
@_date: 2013-08-05 12:27:13
To clarify I started with like .3btc that I had mined. I was  mostly playing the 48% game and was up to almost 6btc over a couple of days playing. The balance is pretty much where it was when i stopped playing, and this is my only wallet.
@_date: 2013-06-26 02:12:18
Ass smart 
@_date: 2013-08-05 12:19:24
you must have misread something somewhere i was mostly playing the 48% games
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:32:35
 its gonna be a while till my order, 16000 something.
@_date: 2013-06-26 04:14:32
nvidia sucks at mining.
