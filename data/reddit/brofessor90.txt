I personally use this product called coolwallet S 
It’s about $100 usd and can be purchased with crypto instead of credit if you want (I chose to pay in ltc) anyway it gen the seeds on the wallet itself making it it 100% secure and it’s form factor is that it is credit card sized and fits in wallet perfectly it’s really cool atleast check out the pics and a video before dismissing it as it’s not as well known as Trezor

looking at bolivares is meaningless if the price vs usd doesn’t change much. Btc went up that’s what happened. Percentage increase was close across all fiat currencies. (If looked at in relevance to usd (the worlds currency))

I’m not saying the original went unaltered. (Note the ones altering it were still the religious ppl like the pope and such with astronomers which I will be an ass and assume were also catholic at the time so still credit belongs to them) the leap year you say was added in 2000 was actually planned over 500 years ago (the alteration you mentioned taking place in 1580s)and the fact remains this btc calendar is just relabeling something that already exists. To create or change a calendar you need to change the numbers that go into it not the words written on top.

Mike Tyson’s scientist brother talked about this before, there is no more specific calendar then the one the Roman Catholic Church  came up with, that’s why modern ppls use bce (before common era) and ce (common era) to replace the religiousness of it but the calendar itself remains unchanged. This btc calendar is the same just proposing the change of how we refer to it, not how the dates are calculated. The Chinese calendar is an example of a calendar that’s not based on the Roman Catholic one.

Anything that has the keys to your wallet on some server somewhere and uses txts or calls to verify and give you access.

Just being honest and I know it might suck for some but bitcoin works great at 10K. 
At 10K 1 sat (smallest unit) is worth 1/100 of a cent and that’s perfect for all the smaller Way poorer people in third world counties. Any more and you would need an off chain solution for fractions of sats. 
At 100K 1 say is 1/10 a cent and still would work but Iran would be priced out for sure as 1 sat= $0.001 = 40 Iran bucks so that would be the smallest transaction there 
At 1M 1 sat becomes a full cent and would be the highest level for small usd transactions and now Americans would need to switch to off chain fractions of any increase happened even after a reproving of everything to bitcoin.

It would be better to compare bitcoin against the dollar (usd). Not fiat in general, it’s very biased. 
Do the same comparison using the dollar vs a random shitcoin, you won’t be happy.

Any cross between them is an extremely biased opinion pushing tactic.
Full disclosure I am fully in support of btc and think it will change the world.

They do answer that there is no fees. 0 fees ever.
Actually they do disclose all this, check out there telegram if u actually have questions not answered in there faq.
Short answer is they are connected to most the exchanges like Coinbase and most times your order gets filled at a better price and they share the profit
If btc is 8100 and you submit an order to buy $100 at that price, the system executes the trade across the best exchange and fills at say 8050 then they split that extra difference with you.

I get what your saying is more of a real life scenario, I was mainly pointing out that bitcoin stops working (for small payments on chain) when it’s smallest unit becomes more valuable than what the least valuable transaction would cost. 
Example: I use my credit card to buy a water for 69¢. so if a sat was worth a dollar I wouldn’t want to buy it.

Check right now if you buy btc using voyager you will save ALL the fees (because voyager doesn’t have any) and also be buying your btc (or other crypto) cheaper then Coinbase. 
As of writing Coinbase 8066.42

I contacted them about the dtrv promotion and asked what I needed to do as I’ve been holding dtr since ico. This was the response I received and I followed the steps but guess what.... not dtrv for me and when I contacted them about it they say I needed to make at least one trade to be eligible, and when I questioned them about it they just close my tickets saying distribution is over. 
If this is a company running an exchange wouldnt it make sense and even “the right thing to do  (lol)”  to fund my account the dtrv like promised. I’m looking for opinions but from where I’m sitting it seems they fucked me.

The world uses the dollar to establish value across all borders (that’s how they arbitrage btc across borders and trade the money back through currency exchange),

Wait the exact wording is if you buy BTC thinking your buying bitcoin you’ve been fooled, BCH is the real bitcoin, now I think you can agree bitcoin cash isn’t bitcoin, as bitcoin (btc) is bitcoin 
You need to realize when someone is talking about bitcoin (that’s the noise we all make with our mouths when we are talking about BTC) on the news or anywhere, we have already socially agreed that the noise we make to mean btc is bitcoin. Not bitcoincash not bitcoingold not bitcoinprivate

I feel like this is becoming a problem. And I’m not trying to offend you. 
People keep trying to make money on the idea and promotion of bitcoin/cryptocurrencies through starting basically a business with the entire consumer base being bitcoin users. This doesn’t spread adoption in any way. Your just selling merch that’s not copyrighted. If you could you would sell Simpson’s phone cases and the like instead of crypto phone cases you would have WAY more people to sell to lmao.
The better idea is to use YOUR skills, and make a product or brand or service of some kind and accept bitcoin as payment.

Bro fuck these haters blockchain is a good wallet just make sure you click the 3 lines at the top and click “back up funds” write down those words and save and never share with anyone those are your private keys.(this was all assuming you created the wallet yourself)
Next for selling, easiest way is download Coinbase and make an account, once verified and you link your bank account you can click the qr code in bitcoin accounts and get the address to send your bitcoin to, copy this address, then open your blockchain wallet click send and paste the address you copied from Coinbase here. Send the amount you wanted to sell and when it gets to Coinbase just click sell bitcoin and it will be sent to your bank in usd. 
I do advise you keep it or at least some of it bitcoin is the future bro

The same way they believe BCH is “bitcoin” (which it isn’t) I can believe in property in heaven and give you a deed for it, just like BCH is “real” so is my deed but a smart person wouldn’t accept the deed (for fake property) as collateral or payment neither would they accept BCH (fake bitcoin) so it is a scam and if you honestly feel it isn’t for some strange reason, please hear me out as I have some great beach front property adjacent to God’s house if you can believe it!

Think about the people when they first start out, they know almost nothing and are In The early stages of learning/hodling. How can you expect them to pull out all their bitcoin. 
Now with that said I do believe once you buy your bitcoin no matter how much, that you should send to your personal wallet you control the keys to (not your keys not your coins is the truth)

I feel like since it’s generating a percentage of the funds you sent to a friend into their crypto and paying it to you, that that’s getting people involved that otherwise never would have thought to. 
You can also sell their token and buy btc or eth (top 10 I believe) right away so it’s getting people involved (be it a small way) but not going against any grain.

I just read through it all and yes you started it. You were on the nazi side basically and didn’t want to admit you might be wrong, you then made an extreme revelation that if you made a bet you found to be stupid wouldnt pay either. 
See here’s where we get off a bit because I accurately named what you had described which would in fact be a “bigger pice of shit”
(Piece of shit : someone who makes a bet knowing they won’t pay but will demand payment  if they win) 
(Bigger piece of shit: someone who morally  thinks it’s good and ok to make a bet knowing they won’t pay if they lose and demand payment if they win)

Stop making excuses for him I’m not gonna bother him anymore unless I see him spouting off like he’s being honorable or dealing with this by not deleting his account and should just admit he’s a weasel and he will continue to be a weasel

Not shilling I use that app cause it had free money to try out the service and whenever you send your friend money you get some metal (which you can sell for cash to ur bank or usd wallet immediately) also you can now use the app to buy like the top 10 crypto’s and send those instead of usd if your prefer. 
So this isn’t shilling a shit coin as it’s just boosting crypto/bitcoin adoption. Especially since you can immediately turn that metal coin into usd or btc

It’s always the time to invest in bitcoin, as long as you don’t consider it investing

You keep saying was wrong when it’s is wrong dude your are wrong u til you pay up
@_date: 2019-05-20 07:11:07
Because I recognize that there is risk of btc going down 80% from where it’s at now

You accidentally pressed the ? after you were finished writing the title 
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:25:46
Ewwwwwwww to all these answers, you need to go binance or to get fiat on go Coinbase and set a market order to avoid the fees

Implying he can’t afford to pay is a lie, he has almost double what he wagered and lost and now owes 
Stop saying “stupid” bet,  that’s subjective a ufc fight might seem stupid to you so I guess sports bets don’t count in your book either (unless your the winner) 
Stop implying I wouldn’t pay and that I’m trying to look “honorable” (I’m not Asian) 
1. You don’t know me,I do make retarded bets 
2. I pay the fuck up when I lose weather I was drunk and bet big running my mouth or if I had serious intentions of winning a wager
 (this seems to fall into the serious wager category as in the original thread you see the kid that won’t pay now suggesting the other guy won’t pay and he will never get his money lmao) 
Him losing his reddit account and starting over will be some sort of loss for him since he won’t pay ANY OF THE DEBT. 
I don’t care personally I just HATE that he’s making it seem like not deleting his account is doing the “right thing” when in reality he’s keeping it out of being selfish. Clearly people want him to lose it to make up for his shit actions I agree

No it’s the same as dressing like a slut and being drunk, high, then drug yourself and lay there passed out in the shadiest place you know at 3am. 
Moral of the story not your keys not your bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:35:40
I’m not acting perfect or any of this your deflecting and trying to make a case for this being ok morally if you want to pretend keep pretending, if you want to actually do somthing to try and make up for what you have done delete your account (lose somthing of life really $0 financial value but some reason you value it) or pay him SOMETHING ANYTHING 
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:43:06
I like the idea except for all the poor dumb people who WILL fuck up and lose whatever they have 
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:44:39
Dude you started being nasty cause you have no point and you made bad choices of words saying you would make a bet and not pay if you lose (I know you wish you worded that differently but you didn’t you straight said you’d be a scammer) 
I said average morals, sexually I’m considered a deviant in most societies. I pay my debts and raw dog married bitches like your mom even though I think her son(?) Is a stupid fuck 
Cool make the same insult I’m done here bro 
And yeah one of  the points of btc was to see who was untrustworthy and then NOT do business with them thereafter

Please tell me where u heard about this
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:49:15
He is choosing not to because he can't afford paying it. $3k are too much, aren't they? I wouldn't make such a stupid bet, but even if I did, I wouldn't pay it either. Also, the other posters found out that he is a minor. How can a minor afford to give up $3k for nothing? 
Because of this comment where you clearly say if you made a bet and lost you wouldn’t pay up either ���� so yes cheat and liar 
and he doesn’t  want to lose anything not even his reddit account. also he won’t even send
 .25btc  or even $100 worth . 
I don’t think I’m better then anyone I’m saying people that lie and cheat like u and the dude who didn’t pay up are less then everyone else that’s all I’m no saint but I also ain’t no punk like you to sorry you have shady morals

Start by checking the address you sent it to matches the address you own the keys to on your computer 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:02:42
Your continuing to show us all your true colors.  Your so caught up in wanting desperately to be right (or feel that way) that your trying to go for personal attacks and neglecting vital information and contradicting yourself.
I mentioned more then once I’m not saying I’m so honorable, I’m about average I would say. People who scam around not paying bets that they themselves deem “stupid” after they lose are probably less then average but I’ll let you decide that for yourself.
If you do hate people who fake being honorable and fair and such then the op should be on your list as he justifies keeping his account by saying otherwise he’d be running away. (Straight up lie) 
You even try to say I would be pleased to see it deleted when my last comment was pretty clear idc about this guy, just hate the public justification for him being shity. 
One more thing he didn’t apologize for making a stupid bet he’s apologizing because he clearly CAN pay his debt but WONT 
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:54:35
Never invest in fiat what you can’t afford to lose 
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:24:43
I’m sure confess means to really be sorry and if you were you would send him 1btc which you have 
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:14:16
I wish more ppl understood that point, that not even whatever god they believe in can’t get their coins back if they sent to wrong address 
or fuck what about accidentally  sending to a bcash wallet they downloaded thinking it was an actual bitcoin wallet, they should teach this shit in school

Best cheapest way is bank transfer to Coinbase (free) transfer usd to Coinbase pro (free) buy and send out crypto (small fee)
