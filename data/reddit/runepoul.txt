That was the original though, true. In today’s reality a couple of companies sit on all of the mining power because the proof of work algorithm has economies of scale and thus inevitably favors centralization.

Bitcoin devs wants big ASIC mining farms to run the network, so much for power to the people. 
And governments and politicians are not enemies of the people, corruption and inequality is, how about we fight those instead, now that we have the tech to do it?

Okay man I guess I stand corrected. Feel free to drop a YouTube link to enlighten me.
Edit: it seems I was in fact correct, although calling it a scam was perhaps too much. Let’s call it an unlikely promise, then. See the bottom of this comment thread for explanation.

Wow I should get my facts straight, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:58:11
Really it won’t stay that way? The lightning network or whatever they’ve promised to fix it looks more and more like a scam promise everyday, and in the meantime competitors are coding like crazy to make alternatives to Bitcoin classic. Let’s not kid ourselves, the only reasonable future for the original Bitcoin is as collectors item.
Not saying it’s gonna lose price, maybe it will reach 100K but it has no future as a currency. I say this as someone who who holds BTC myself but is mainly interested in the tech side of things.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:50:48
TLDR: It happened when the bitcoin community decided that a high price was more important than the tech.
The slightly longer answer is that everyone who understood the tech could see the high fees problem coming from the very beginning. So while some people tried to come up with ways to evolve the technology, the majority of the mining power behind the Bitcoin chain voted against upgrading the protocol to make it actually useable as a currency. Probably with their own financial interest in mind. 
So in the best case, Bitcoin’s future is as a form of digital gold, in the worst case it will be worthless because it has no real use anymore. Like it’s not anonymous either, the best you can do is try and tumble it to obscure transaction, so not even Silk Road like sites are gonna use it much longer.

That’s from the description at GitHub. It also shows there’s just one guy called RustyRussel (he is from Blockstream) working in it and his last code update was December 25th.
Wikipedia also mentions the single company who tried using it in December. But I think it’s safe to assume that it’s not at all usable yet and there’s no date set for when it’s ready. 
To be fair it looks like a lot of effort and research has been put into it. But it’s been talked about for years and there’s no indication that it will be ready anytime soon.

That’s true, but then it will be those second layer techs’ logo on that sign in your fitness center. And those second layer tech companies will want to use and underlying chain that is fast, secure and cheap. At this point the Bitcoin chain is arguably the most secure chain (i.e against 51% attacks), but that is likely to change as the other chains grow and distributed ledger tech evolves.

Sorry, a lot of people know it, it’s a website where people put their code. I know there’s a lot of information an sites like reddit, but there’s also *a lot* of marketing and false information posted here. 
So if you’re in doubt about how something like LN is going then you can see it with your own eyes at github.
You’re right I should probably not have made some of those claims if they were wrong. I haven’t checked it out yet though I should have.
But if you’re not a coder yourself and don’t really understand the tech maybe you should be more open to other people’s viewpoints, no offense.

Science actually don’t know this for sure yet. String theorists think there are 10+ dimensions and the “*Universe as a hologram*” cosmologists and some “*Universe is a simulation*” people think we’re on a 2D surface that appears 3D (and they have the math to back it up).
That being said, I agree with you in believing that we’re 3D. That is, if we discount *time* as a separate dimension. But tbh I’m no physicist.

Being anti-something is the easy part, the hard part is finding out what to be pro-.  Freedom is great, but unfortunately there’s “no such thing as a free lunch” in the economic sense, meaning there’s a cost to *everything* - this is as solid an economic law as they come. 
Free individuals is another matter, but it’s not easy to strike the balance between freedom *from* something (such as hunger or sickness) and freedom *to* something (such as speaking your mind, polluting the air, growing pot, etc.).
Not saying any of this to dissuade you, I’m glad to hear you’ve got plans to shake things up, the World needs it.

@_date: 2018-08-26 18:04:06
Hmm, I don’t understand what you mean by “money is a delusion”, to me that makes no sense, it’s like saying “milk is a delusion”. I think “delusion” means something made up in your mind, and money is not like that. If you say something like this that isn’t true or that kind of doesn’t make sense, I think that’s actually really bad for you and your goals. There are actual facts enough in the World that you could say instead, and thus convince others and become more focused on how to collaborate on achieving those goals.
Yeah, the “Universe provides everything we need” is sort of true in a simple sense, but it doesn’t really make it any easier to answer your question about “how to use it”.
Again, I hope you don’t take any of what I say as dissuasion, but I really think it’s important to use a meaningful language to discuss these important ideas.
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:07:54
I’d be careful with the categorical statements. If you simply state the facts you know to be true and then build on those then you’ll be in a better position to do bring about the positive change you want; for example when you say that people are “way worse off” in System A compared to System B, without a way to measure/define what you mean by “being way worse off”, then it’s almost impossible to convince other people about it or even form meaningful ideas for yourself about a possible way forward. Not saying this is easy.

They had good success with experiments giving homeless people a bag of cash instead of social help. 1 year later they had invested in living space and getting their shit lives fixed. While the “normal” welfare’s homeless people still lived under bridges despite getting more social help from society workers and costing society a lot more on the whole.

Why didn’t the “real” Bitcoin network upgrade the block sizes then? That seemed super scammy to not do that.
The last time I used Bitcoin on a bar the transaction cost was more than the beer itself. So to me best crypto is most useful crypto.

Who is AXA? Im sure the Bilderberg group, which is like old money people and old media people, is too disparate as a group and way too illiterate about technology to be behind any crypto scams. But someone like Blockstream? Yeah, sure it’s totally believable that a private tech-savvy company like them could and would conspire with new media people for bitcoin profits. That doesn’t make it true of course, but it’s far from a tinfoil idea.

Why do you hate it? What if they’re right?
@_date: 2018-05-06 19:12:03
Hmm I guess it’s all about what “Bitcoin” means, right? You obviously think it means the coin that’s currently denominated *BTC*, right? I mean there’s  really no better definition I can think of that fits your bill, other than perhaps “Bitcoin is the version of Bitcoin that has the original chain and didn’t increase the block size limit in 2017”, or something like that. 
Anyways, I get your point about hating deception in the crypto space. Although I personally think it would probably be best for everyone if no single coin was called “Bitcoin”, so that the term would just refer broadly to different implementations of the concept described in Satoshi’s whitepaper. What would think about that?

But Bitcoin is deflationary because of the fixed supply cap plus supply attrition by private keys getting lost and mistake transactions to non-existent addresses. Do you agree with me that this attribute of BTC makes it completely useless as a currency in the long run? If yes, do you see a way around this *other* than ensuring a steady inflation of BTC, i.e. dropping the hard supply cap?
Edit: Also, could be interesting if anybody knew Satoshi’s thoughts on this, he must have thought about it.

No. We need deflation proof money, otherwise people won’t spend them. The hard cap on BTC means the price will inevitably go to infinity over time. Which is probably the major reason nobody wants to actually use Bitcoins for payments, because it’s more rational to hodl in most cases.
What we need in a (crypto)currency is **price stability** with controlled, predictable inflation. That was also the whole point of countries switching to fiat over gold and silver.
So this post is both technically wrong and a sure recipe for rectal disease.

Very insightful comment. Do you think maybe when gravity formulas were discovered, nobody could stop that from becoming technology? Perhaps blockchain is the same kind of discovery.
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:28:11
I’m speaking from a purely mathematical point of view, and as such the supply *will* go to 0 given enough time, unless the protocol is changed. Even if people only lose one private key, say, once every million years, then eventually the total supply of Bitcoins will be 0. At that point, if some future archaeologist finds a private key buried deep in the ground, that coin will have infinite value. That is, if demand remains the same, which of course it won’t, but that was my premise.
So my argument is kind of hypothetical, but I think it shows why deflationary monetary policy combined with private key attrition isn’t sustainable.
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:30:23
I agree with what you wrote, my point was basically that Bitcoin’s deflationary policy has to be changed at some point.
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:30:34
But it will, right, at least linearly? With deflation built into the protocol isn’t it inevitable that supply goes to 0, indicating a prize = infinity as long as there is any demand at all?
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:29:32
Actually, that’s not the case. Let’s say demand stay the same, but supply goes towards 0 (because of people losing their private keys over time and minting of new coins stops at 21 million). So there will be demand for bitcoin like today, but as time goes on there will be decreasingly fewer and fewer coins left to buy.
Then what will the price be in the end?
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:35:54
I believe you skipped some steps to get to that conclusion. Just because something becomes worth infinity in the future doesn’t mean you should spend all your money on it now. Like I said, it requires that there’s still demand for Bitcoin in the far future, plus you’d probably need to store it securely for generations before it reaches near infinity price.
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:55:10




Agreed, although someone could be running a node and just be waiting idly for transactions. So the ability to transact is not gone just because all coins disappear.
