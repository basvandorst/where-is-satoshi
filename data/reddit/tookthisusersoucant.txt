So basically the incompetence of governments makes it super impossible. It did cross my mind that at the theoretical time where Bitcoin was the main currency, governments would lose a significant amount of power and that would probably tear a hole in my argument that governments could gain the influence they need to pull something like this off. It also requires that governments work together against its peoples in a more transparently obvious way by attempting to take away a thing that people already have and is not borrowed from the government (any right eg. to have a bank account, is borrowed and can be taken away. Bitcoins cannot be taken away by anyone).

What is his message? 
I get that he suddenly wants to take credit for the creation of bitcoin, but he also is trying to use that influence something. What does he think happened to bitcoin that he wants to change?
The most I could find from slimming his site was that Bitcoin SV is the real bitcoin, but it didn't really explain what made it so real compared to bitcoin.

I'm open, what is Bitcoin if not a store of value?  
I'm not sure if you are trying to propose that people should be actively using their Bitcoin instead of holding it, or if you are suggesting that any Bitcoin you own is worthless?

How is this value calculated/predicted?

I use keepass and the database is backed up to a cloud provider. That said, the database is encrypted with a password that only I know that is a considerable length, the cloud is obviously behind a user account and password (although this is potentially still compromisable since I doubt that they encrypt my files based on the password)
That said, there are still dangers to look out for. Don't let it render on your screen unnecessarily, don't copy it to the clipboard, don't type it out on your keyboard. .. unless you fully trust that the device you are using is 100% clean, no malware etc because there are malicious tools that can run on iPhone/android/windows/mac/Linux etc.
Ultimately, mitigate your risks, you can't be 100% secured. But you can: 
- keep your coins in multiple addresses as you get more to ensure no one account is considered worth effort to hack.
- don't run your mouth about your worth, don't put a target on your back
- don't put your key where there are other keys (without other layers of security) -- hackers will consider that worth hacking because they get many accounts and a significant amount of reward.
- keep up to date with the tools you use to secure/hold your bitcoin incase any of them become vunerable. You'll probably be fine because you had more than 1 layer of protection and it's not worth hacking you but you should use that time to fix your situation before it becomes convenient.
- be selective about what devices you expose your keys on.
- be smart about what else you use those devices for.
I'd be way into learning how coinbase backs up your keys before using it. Even if they back up your keys to your private account, there's going to be a pattern: maybe they back it up to the same place in everyone's cloud, also maybe they use a vunerable encryption. If OneDrive for example became vunerable, and I knew some of these patterns, I could find the keys of every OneDrive user. And even if they were encrypted, if I know how they encrypt it, I can now use that knowledge to hack the least secure ones (bad passwords)
That said, coinbase may have enough layers of security that you'd need more than just one of those layers to become vunerable before your key can get hacked. If that's the case, then, and only then will I trust it. But I'll still choose a good password if part of my security is that password.

Actually, when it comes to money in the bank, the money is **not** really yours. 
I agree that for doing things like trading, where you want an agent to manage your money using their tools to ensure you can time your transactions just right, it is pretty enticing to use exchanges.
The difference between Bitcoin and banks is **trust**. With banks, you **don't** really own your money; Assuming that having cash is the closest you can get to owning your money, then putting it in the bank is still convenient for most of us, and we allow that convenience to influence our **trust** in banks alongside other factors such as our education, and lack of personable evidence or experiences that indicate that we should not trust them.
I trust that my government has regulations in place to protect any money that I give to a bank. I trust that the bank will honour any transactions that I ask them to make on my behalf and I trust that if I want that money in cash, that they will honour it or the government will have things in place to ensure I can get it. I also trust that all of these safety nets can secure my net worth, because I don't believe that I own enough to be affected in the ways that I have read in the news. 
Trust can be broken though, so if I am not paying attention, something could change (laws, regulations) and before I know it, I could lose access to all or some of that money.
With Bitcoin, there is an opportunity to remove the need for trust. Trust can be broken, so there is a large push by the community to keep it out. This is why the strong wording of "not your keys, not your Bitcoin". It is a reminder that we have not yet built a whole trust based ecosystem around Bitcoin and we have the opportunity to keep it out.
Even if you are trading bitcoin, over time (if not already), there will be software that you can run and manage yourself. You will get to ensure that **you** have the tools to trade without needing to trust any third party. 
Until then, you will have to trust exchanges. Just don't assume that this is the final solution, keep looking forward for innovations that make your trust based conveniences obsolete, and avoid conveniences that you don't have to use. Especially for large sums of money. Finally, always advise people to avoid trust based systems: your keys, your Bitcoin.

The difference between Bitcoin and banks is **trust**. With banks, you don't really own your money, even if you take it out in cash, over time, it's value (against itself) will go down (today I have 0.01% of GBP, tomorrow, I have 0.005% of GBP). If we assume that having cash is the closest you can get to owning your money, then putting it in the bank is still better for me.

You should do everything in your power to ensure that that software is not going to steal and leak your keys to any malicious person, but I think that although it's hard, let's not rush into building systems of trust.

I had a quick re read and I see your point, the paper talks about providing irreversible transactions for irreversible services. I guess things like labour, where payment is done after work, is a good example of this.
It also talks about the privacy factor and how keeping public keys anonymous is important to maintain anonymity; with the way exchanges work today, this makes buying and using as needed very difficult if you want to preserve your anonymity.
For this reason, owning an amount of bitcoin can be useful if you own it anonymously.
The paper doesn't really discuss how to convert from fiat to bitcoin, but the idea of using it purely for it's transactional purposes implies that most if not all the bitcoin should go to exchanges when idle. If this is what you are suggesting that the paper implies, then I disagree.
With that, you could argue that while we are working out ways to acquire bitcoin safely, securely and privately, holding is valuable not for speculation of price, but for opportunity to vote with your capital for how currency should be traded before use.
Giving all or most of our bitcoin to exchanges sounds very dangerous because by allowing exchanges to hold unused currency, they are able to hold it ransom.
A value of holding bitcoin, is the ability to use it freely at any time you wish.
TLDR; if you don't think there are enough various ways to acquire bitcoin freely and fluidly, (but you believe that this will change over time) there is value in holding bitcoin IMO.

The fees go to the miner who successfully added your transaction to the bitcoin ledger. That could be an individual or an organisation, or a mining farm.
You pay a higher fee to incentivise miners to include your transaction in the next block since each block has a size limit and miners order transactions by reward.

I choose the one that withstands bullshit, ddos and could even bite back over the one wrapped in bubble wrap anyday. I mean, you're the thing that holds the value of my life's work! I'm not gonna entrust that to the teletubbies.

Yet. 
Maybe later it will be when Bitcoin has become a stable currency that people don't see as an investment, but rather a useful currency for trading.

It really depends on what you consider fraudulent vs what the network considers fraudulent. 
A really bad example I can think of is if you depend on the "spend the same coins with a higher fee = undo the last sent transaction -- as long as the first transaction hasn't been confirmed yet" rule. It's not really a rule in the network, it's a side effect of the way miners work. They want the most fees but can only mine a limited number of transactions per block; they will order by highest fee and take as many as they can and try to mine that block.
You could create a miner that does the opposite, or even one that takes other heuristics into play eg. prioritise any transactions to address X over everything. That's cool, but winning proof of work is like winning the lottery; you aren't gonna be able to predict when/if you will win so think up all the ways you could exploit that behaviour all you want -- unless your exploit is a long term plan that can give you benefit from one successful mine on your rig after some years, it's not useful.
When you have applied your "exploit", as others have said, the network will validate your block and the order of transactions isn't really checked because all the transactions were valid, just not in the order that gives you the most rewards... And so what? -- again, it's not like you were able to coordinate mining a block with a specific transaction... This would require you having as close to 100% mining power so you could guarantee that YOU mined the next block.
Also I want to add emphasise the cost that everyone else was explaining: it's not just the cost of mining that one block, it's also the cost of attempting to mine all the other blocks before it until you finally got lucky.

But why do we not hear so much about hacked fiat? Surely the central reserve is a good place to start, but so would just banks. AFAIK, robberies don't seem to affect the average joe so its not so breaking news.
