I think that Buffet made a mistake with not investing in Bitcoin, and if he talk about Bitcoin he knows he did

Oh please, you are going to leave Bitcoin because it has lost some of its value? Are you serious? It's the best proof that you are only after money here. If you don't care about Bitcoin then just leave. Ethereum won't replace Bitcoin because Ethereum wasn't designed to be currency. It is used for different things. If Bitcoin collapsed right now (though there is not reason to), all cryptocurrencies would have problems with being stable. The whole market would panic and cash out which would lead to massive decreases. I don't think that anyone here would like to see it.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:20:17
I hope that they will realize  it soon...
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:43:04
I wish..
