I typically send ETH because it’s quicker  
I follow the same steps
Coinbase -&gt;GDAX-&gt;Binance. 
You can always sell ETH for BTC on Binance if there is a trade pair that isn’t supported by ETH

It plays to a different market, the fee thing is super high though even still at 8.5%. Would be interesting to know if they accept prepaid cards. This one did accept Debit and Credit as well. Would also be interested to see who else goes and uses these machines.
I use coinbase for all my BTC purchases but wanted to give it a try. And funny you mention change counting machines.. I actually took all my change to that today, to get $$ that I then put into the BTC ATM. 
Coinstar took me for 11.4% ($41.21 became $37)
Digital Mint took me for 14% ($37 became $32.17)
