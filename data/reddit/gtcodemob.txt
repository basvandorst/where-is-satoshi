It went sideways in 2015 on that graph so the rainbow shifted to a lower slope.

So, Jaime Dimon’s daughter thus preserved the family legacy by hodling two BTC?
Or, was it that Jaime helped secure BTC platforms?
I don’t disagree with your premise about adoption yet am curious about actual possibilities for inflows needed to achieve the goals you’ve stated.

So, it’s a way to enrich early adoptors?  What about others who couldn’t afford coin? 
Have the big hodlers set up philanthropy groups to better humanity?  I’m curious about the social implications of enriching early adoptors with legitimate wealth.
The goal was to fight existing financial systems and presumably there will be an ongoing call for social change for the better. Not saying it won’t happen, just not seeing it.  Looks like folks pumping for their own benefit, not in the short term but in the long term so they can become rich or wealthy before Johnny come lately.

Yep crazy to sell when the tide is still rising.  Too many buyers and no sellers.
Hannah was all like, “but I feel bad for the spray liner guys!”, and she’s responsible for forcing me to spill the beans!  They are not happy let me tell you.  No wonder btc is taking over.

Hence hodler-roast!
Odds that the Don has meetings with Asian leaders to attack this problem in unison: very good
If big insiders want to sell now, they can and will, and they might due to price technicals (keep the dream alive), and political fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:23:02
Sounds reasonable, invest with risk capital and let it ride.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:13:11
It’s expected that this thread would be downvoted.  It’s still a valid inquiry.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:51:44
It’s a raging bull so people chase the bull.
Yes wait for a real pullback to go long. It’s way overextended and in the sell channel now.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:41:37
What will they do?
Hodlers hodl and there’s no supply to go around.  Saturation inevitable but technically you could sucker people into the ponzi churn all the way to a million and give wealth to folks who wouldn’t have had it otherwise.  
Ultimate social experiment of our era.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:36:50
It’s not directed at you.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:42:45
You’re assuming the price is not going to correct. We just hit a new ATH which is messing with your emotions.
If you step back and relax the price will fall.  Universe has a sense of humor sometimes.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:39:20
Yes newbies don’t realize this smells like the latecomer extension.  Washout is a natural phenomenon.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:58:12
Author didn’t hodl and talking his lack of book.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:51:59
Agree completely, just curious if buyers will step forth to make it happen.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:24:21
Lightning hack notwithstanding.  Hey, just because it’s a hack doesn’t mean it won’t scale!
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:02:52
Just needs more money thrown at it to push higher.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:38:41
Yes if buyers buy, it will rise.

If Bitcoin is to win
Think about the hunt brothers lesson
What bitcoin needs
Is a country
Get btc logo on some nukes
We can trade nuke futures 
Post apocalypse puts, cold storage btc impervious to global thermonuclear war
Make sure your fallout shelter has guns gold bitcoin And spam!! I’m sure bitcoin hashing works without the internet!!
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:37:11
Few people are willing to face reality.  I asked the right question.  We are saturated at least for now.  Cascade time...
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:18:45
So you’re conditioned to hodl no matter the price?  What if it drops below 5k? Hodl?
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:25:38
You pigs are so greedy. The game doesn’t care about you, or your future.  If you can’t recognize when pig fest preparations are done, you’ll give in to pure unadulterated greed.
Sell this pig, boys.

Let’s say you place the order for Sell 1 btc @ limit 7400.  Your place is held in line and if there’s a buyer to chew up your 7400 order it’ll get filled and you will have sold 1 @ 7400.
Otherwise if it falls without filling you’ll still have your 1 btc
This is roughly how it works.

We are near sell level 7425!!! 
Lower high forming now.....   couldn’t quite make it to Rain Nash’s 7425 sell trigger that every hedgie saw.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:32:59
Anyone buying now likely is doing so because they believe the price will continue to rise.  It would be surprising if any large fraction of newcomers would be okay buying just before a big decline.  They want to feel comfy that they got in soon enough to make money for them, being the early comer (relative to the late comer).  It’s just musical chairs.
People push adoption so the price will rise.  It’s a natural phenomenon with historical precedence.  This says nothing about whether the rise will continue yet it seems the reality is based on expectation of much higher prices.  This is how it’s sold primarily.  Fomo

Scary how? For a selloff? Or melt-up? I’m assuming you mean melt-up since you are long?
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:15:09
So, you were around for the early days?
Sorry but you are wrong.  Very smart connected people identified early on the potential.  Satoshi himself said this.
I’ve been hanging around the community since before $1 and know precisely the mentality of many of the earliest hodlers.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:57:04
They will cooperate for economic reasons, good point though.
Yuan isn’t exactly a solid replacement.  All governments race to the bottom.
BTC and the cc movement could be the catalyst for change, which was the goal.  It will be interesting to see how adoption of cc for commerce takes hold. 
As a technologist, cc’s are exciting, yet it’s so early to say if something better will come along.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:35:54
I can’t wait to see this thing break 7,500 shortly, because beyond that, there’s evidence that pigs bred with apes to make humans.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:21:53
Below 5k, copy that.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:10:17
Oink oink, humans.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:45:30
This is the sell zone indeed
Suckers will get suckered
We will see at least a 1k drop from up here
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:07:04
It would be difficult for wealthy and powerful folks with their own agenda to hide.  
There’s no such thing as wealth that isn’t accounted for, not on any large scale. 
Are you referring to collaborative orgs such as the bilderberg group?
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:00:22
Fair enough, you’re banking on much more fiat coming into BTC.
Hard to disagree given the expanding exposure in the public eye.
I showed a bank teller last month a chart of BTC, and they couldn’t believe it, nor had they heard of it.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:34:24
Ask yourself if governments will pursue the superior technology or the one that has weirdo hodlers from half life and magic the gathering as the new overlords.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:38:28
This thing is so topped out and newbies will get smoked.
Upside potential is very limited now. Sell is a good idea!!
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:30:25
Anyway it’s not an exact science.  People will try to sell up here. Beyond 7650 or so is clear skies.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:35:45
It’s cooked.  Pig roast is served. 7550 is upper log channel.
Don’t be a fool! Be the greater fool!
