If you think the price will fall below $13k then obviously wait for that. You're asking people to predict the future. If we knew the price was gonna drop to say, $12k, the price would have already dropped, because why would anyone pay more then $12k.

Exactly! Dollar cost averaging and hodling for 2+ years, will likely *greatly* outperform day trading. Especially when considering that a) most new traders lose money, and b) short term capital gains tax will wreck  any profits you may have. 
Best recommendation is to buy often what you can afford to lose, and consider long term vs short term taxes. 
Also, get a hardware wallet (Trezor, Nano S) and move your coins off the exchange once it is a substantial amount.

They were very low or free because not many people used it. Now with more competition to be included in the next block, the fees are higher. Altcoins have the same problem as Bitcoin, there fees are only lower because **not many people use them.**

Bitcoin has value in the same way that currency has value. What is backing the $USD? It actually has more value than the $USD because it is a controlled finite supply, unlike any currency to date.
Just because no one uses SWIFT or banks clearing houses directly, doesn't mean they don't unknowingly depend on them. 
I don't think you have properly thought this through.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:50:06
Yes, this will cause some big volatility, but a year ago people didn't care at all about Bitcoin, and the price still went up, albeit at a more gradual pace.
What if Bitcoin's price is an S curve, instead of a bubble. It has the network effect, so the more people that use it, the more it increases exponentially. *I don't have any clue how the internet works, but I still use it!*
Even with all the new dumb money coming in now, it doesn't change the fact that many many brilliant developers are always working on new improvements to the protocol. 
My advice is to take enough money out of Bitcoin that you don't care if the price falls drastically. That way you are in a position that you can either walk away happy, or buy it up once doom and gloom take hold. "Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful" -Warren Buffet

Very good point. I forgot to mention that. When you decide to spend BTC from a paper wallet you must **sweep** the entire balance. In other words you cannot send a portion of the balance, you must send the entire balance. Hence why hardware wallets (Trezor or Ledger) are more useful if you plan on making transactions often. Paper Wallets are great for long term storage, terrible for everyday use.
 Refer to [this]( when spending from Paper Wallets.

Paper Wallets as cold storage, *from a trust source*, is far superior to storing on hot wallets for new users. I've heard of countless people downloading malware clones of electrum etc, or keyloggers, or deleting their wallet.dat, etc...  
Trezor is the way to go, but Paper Wallets, *from a trusted source* like bitaddress and generated offline is just as secure, IMO.

No, I think you are looking at the ~~recent trades~~ order book on an exchange. That shows the orders to buy or sell above or below (limit order) the current price (market price). Trading on exchanges is a sidechain. They happen on the exchange and not on the bitcoin blockchain.
  
What is exchange on bitcoinwisdom are you looking at?
@_date: 2017-02-28 07:20:13


Sign up with a Bitcoin exchange. For example, [GDAX]( which is the Coinbase exchange. You can move funds between Coinbase and GDAX for free. GDAX limit orders are 0% commission (that is when you place an order to buy/sell at above/below the current market price).
There are many different exchanges to trade on. **However, when your Bitcoin is on an exchange, you don't control the private key, the exchange does.** You are trusting the exchange to not get hacked, etc.  
The greatest gift Satoshi Nakamoto gave to the world is the ability to be your own bank, to be the only one in control of your money through private keys.  
If you do decide to try to trade on exchanges, test your abilities on [BitMEX Simulated Trading]( before you risk actual Bitcoin.

My point was that, while there are 18million BTC currently mined, since only 15% of that is being traded, it makes it very easy for huge price spikes as mania sets in.
It also allows for huge drops in price at the top of a parabolic move. 
In other words, it is extremely volatile. Historically, buying while the price is moving sideways, and "BTC is boring and dead" has worked very well. If history repeats (no guarantee it will), long term accumulation and hodling, will outperform active trading.

Most of us long term hodlers, bought small amounts, but frequently. Even $20 a week, over a few years, with the increases in price have lead to massive portfolios. 
Invest what you can afford to lose, and do it frequently. Next thing you know, you'll have a nice portfolio, without even noticing.
Coinbase is great to start with. Find someone that can refer you, or pm me. Once you start to buy long term, you need to find cheaper buying fees, such a Gemini. Fees will eat into your potential profits long term.

I get what your saying tho. Fees are high. Back in 2013 and before, fees were a few penny's or free. Now the fees are high, it just tells you that there is greater demand to be included in next block. 
I think of the blockchain like digital real estate. The greater the demand, the greater the fees. It sounds easy to just build more houses (increase the block size like BCash), but I'd rather store my wealth in a mansion, than in a subsidized rent-controlled building with low demand.

@_date: 2017-11-01 04:21:12
There will be another drop, for sure. But when? Many people on were expecting a dip from $1,100 to $800 a few months ago. Then, it shot up to over $4,000.
The problem about waiting for the dip, is you don't know when it will happen, or why.
China can't ban Bitcoin again. The SEC denying the ETF appeal won't effect it as much as the first denial, etc. So, it gets harder and harder for negative news to drop the price as dramatic as we have seen. Unless a black swan event happens, but those by definition are unpredictable.
No one knows when the next drop will occur. It could happen now at $6,400, at $7,000, at $10,000, at $100,000. If anyone knew when it was drop, it would of already dropped.

Again, lack of evidence. Every dump after a hype cycle, since BTC was worth 38cents, or so, has been called manipulation.

When BTC was at 20k, all of you prayed it would go to your entry point you missed. Now that it's at those levels. You want to sell.

You're basically describing day trading. When it goes wrong, is when you sell expecting a dip, and it continues going up. Then you FOMO and buy back in at a higher price. It works both ways.
For example, many people sold at $1,100 expecting it to drop again to $800. A month or so later it was over $4,000.

The fact that Coinbase told everyone to move their Bitcoin off of their exchange, in order to claim their BCH before the fork, shows that they are more than likely solvent.
Also, they are regulated by NYS Bitlicense which requires them to have reserves.
While I doubt they are insolvent, it doesn't mean I recommend keeping any BTC on any exchange.

It's just like any other market. The crowd is always wrong. 
"the S&amp;P 500’s annualized return drops from 9.2% to 5.4% if an investor missed out on the 10 best days in each year. The numbers for Bitcoin show a dramatic difference in the same scenario.
the annualized return from 2013 to 2017 of Bitcoin would be a **negative 25%** if an investor had missed the 10 best days in each year. The two positive return years, 2016 and 2017, were not enough to make up for the declines in the other four."

Every 4 years the amount of BTC that gets issued to miners drops in half. By 2030, 99% of all Bitcoin that will ever be created (21 million) will have been created. It will then take 100 years for the last 1% to be mined.

@_date: 2017-09-21 06:45:37
Bitcoin is a great study in competition.
High transaction fees just mean there exist greater competition to be added to the immutable, incorruptible, and eternal blockchain ledger.
Higher mining difficulty, means more miners competing for an ever decreasing Bitcoin block reward, and the fee market competition  for access to every block.
Demand and supply.

Exactly, well put.  
High fees also mean that there is a increasing demand for entries in every block. I think of this as digital real estate on a decrentalized public ledger. High fees don't make me concerned, decreasing fees would make me very. Fees act very much like Bitcoin's supply cap, scaricity and demand drive it all.  
 Transactions used to be included in blocks with zero fees. Now with more and more users, competition has led to higher and higher fees. This is healthy and self-correcting. Competition for entries on the blockchain is what we should strive to maintain. 
Laissez-Faire!  
Tl;dr: higher fees = higher demand. Bitcoin blockchain is digital real estate.

Traditional currencies offer inflation. Gold offers a decent store of value, until they find more shiny rocks. Bitcoin offers deflation at a predictable rate (every 4 years ÷ 2), uncoupled from every other asset class, encrypted and unhackable (if you generate your own private keys offline), divisable, globally distributed, and so on.... 
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:21:06
Doesn't work that way. 
Also, the Bitcoin dominance % is insanely understated because most coins are clones and forks of each other. Just look at ETH and ETC. At the hard fork, the supply DOUBLED instantly, causing Bitcoins dominance to drop artificially. 
Also, look at Ripple. They premined the entire supply, and kept like over 65% for themselves. That's means 65% of their marketcap is not available to the market.
Bitcoin dominance is extremely high. Don't be mislead by unreliable data.

Yes. Increasing transaction fees are a clear indicator that more and more people are turning to Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. The gold rush didn't stop because more people showed up to mine for gold. 
Scaling will be solved in time. The biggest risk to Bitcoin would be changing the code too quickly without years of testing. Why risk fixing something that isn't broken? 
Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing.

The SEC is reviewing the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF decision due to an appeal by the BATS exchange. This new chairman is for deregulation. This could change everything.

Historically, meaning every time horizon before a day or two ago, the answer to your question was buy now. No one knows where the price will be in the future, so don't listen to those who claim they do. Make your own decision irregardless of anyone elses opinion.

I would highly recommend using seperate paper wallets. They are completely secure (unless you loose the paper). 
The two main advantages are that hackers cannot steal your bitcoins since the private key is not stored anywhere online, and it keeps you from the temptation of trading the bitcoins you have set aside for them when the price fluctuates.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:23:43
I don't think there would be anyway that they could make bitcoins illegal because of its decentralized nature. It could be made illegal to transfer currencies into bitcoins, but the bitcoins itself would live on, and be even more valuable since they would be scarce (in my opinion).

PSA: 45% of BTC exchanges close, and some without being able to refund clients funds. I highly recommend spreading your funds out between a few exchanges, and/or transferring BTC's to a wallet such as Blockchain.info, encrypted USB, or paper wallet (the most secure).

@_date: 2013-05-05 00:40:35
It's much easier than it sounds. This is the best option I've found: 
The main thing to to keep in mind is that you can continuously upload coins to the paper wallet (using the public key), but once you withdraw any amount (using the private key), the remainder of the coins in the wallet (your change) would be sent to a NEW public key. 
Just as if you were to spend money at a store. The original bill you use is gone, and the change you get back would be a new bill.
There is nothing as secure as a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-05-08 09:04:39

@_date: 2013-05-08 03:07:59
If your willing to wait a week, use Dwolla.com linked to your bank account, and transfer funds (costs 25 cents) to either CampBX.com (0.55% fee) or MTGox.com (0.60% fee).
This is the cheapest, but not the fastest way.
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:26:54
I got you. Over time it adds up. I'm just happy spreading the word about Camp BX. My biggest concerns are security and low fees. BX wins in both those categories.
@_date: 2013-05-08 05:04:27
[Dwolla]( --&gt; [Camp BX]( is by far my favorite. 25 cents to transfer, 0.55% to trade. It's hard to beat that!

This is great. Thanks for posting!

Another great idea is to buy Casascius coins. They are minted and loaded with between 1 and 100 Bitcoins. It is the same principle as the paper wallet, the private key is not online. In this case it is engraved on the coin.
The only drawback to this, versus the paper wallet, is that you pay extra for the engraved coin.

If you were to follow this strategy you would have gained 140.43% versus 125.92% using buy-and-hold (not including fees) since March 30th.

I am assuming that demand would stay high. Good point Craig.

Thanks for the info! Are Canadians sticking with cash transfers with all the issues with the banks not wanting their customers to buy bitcoins? This all seems crazy to me. I hope the US doesn't follow suit.

Wow coinmama IS expensive!
@_date: 2013-05-06 07:17:32
Good question!
@_date: 2013-05-08 10:04:15
Thanks! Fixed

So you get a 10% discount on your trading fees for life? Does that mean your trading fee is .495%?
(hope my math is right)
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:36:55
I highly recommend [CampBX]( as well. They have the lowest fees that I have seen, which is very important when acquiring bitcoins. With [Coinbase]( you are paying well over 1% just to get your bitcoins! With [CampBX]( you can buy bitcoins for half of that, 0.55%, and your dealing with a US firm which abides by US regulations.

I used it to point out that all the worry over the current fluctuations in price isn't as important as most make it out to be. Either bitcoins will be worth a lot in the future, or worthless.
Either believe in the technology and invest, or don't and look elsewhere. In my opinion the bitcoin community has been too focused on price, and not on the long term feasibility.

5 cents on a dollar really do add up! That is why I never use bitinstant (fees are way to high). I stick with Dwolla and CampBX.
Besides the fees, the reason I use CampBX primarily is that I couldn't register with MT Gox for awhile as their signup was down. Also I don't want to go through the hassle of giving them my photo ID (BX doesn't require that).
I have just registered with Gox and plan on using both to spread out my risk of being hacked and losing everything. CampBX is based in the US and FDIC insured on your deposits!

I've been waiting for someone to point this out! Yes, because of the moving average lag in the charts, I use the 1 hour chart to begin buying or sell as the lines merge. The H1 merged at between $95-$97, with the H4 merging at 110.90.
Double confirmation.

Charts only tell you when you should have bought. They don't predict the future.

That is how ponzi scams work. You get paid out initially, which boots your confidence to invest more. Eventually the system will collapse and you will loose everything.
Don't get tricked into this.

Great article! I completely agree
@_date: 2013-05-06 04:18:05
Yellow line = shorter-term 12-period exponential moving average (EMA) line
Blue line = longer-term 26-period EMA line
EMA is the historical average price, with more weight on the recent price. I hope this helps. The technical parts get me too.
@_date: 2013-05-04 04:07:04
I tend to use the H1 as a marker of price, and the H4 for confirmation of direction.
Hey, the lines are about to meet on the H1!!! I'm getting ready!

I just started investing in Bitcoins this month after I read the NY Times article about the Winklevoss Brothers investing. I had never heard of Bitcoins before.

Someone requested this recently! Glad to see they made one! Going to watch it now
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:31:48
Can you clarify your question please? Transaction cycles? I'm not sure what you mean.
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:31:03
We are definitely at a crossover into a buy! Once the chart lines update, I will post it here. Confirmation of the buy on the way.
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:44:51
lol... we will have to wait and see
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:50:42
I was thinking the other day that someone should do this. Great idea! Wish you all the best!
@_date: 2013-05-04 04:07:36
Yes sir!
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:21:09
I am actually excited when it drops in price like this. I am new to the bitcoin world, and as a long term bull I enjoy getting in at  cheap prices!
The lower my dollar cost average is the higher my future profits will be.
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:32:33
it's worked well for me so far!
