Exactly... They are saying we are bullshitting? Why would we? What is there in it for us? We just want our money back. And the current situation doesn't look good.

Wow! Thank you for sharing this! 
I have a wallet with 185 bitcoins and I believe the password was secret123, but it didn't work! It's maybe secret321, but I will let David try it for me instead, he sounds like a really nice, trustworthy guy! 
Thanks man!

Just want to mention that the lawsuit has been filed, expect more news within 1 week.
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:49:11
No, it is totally legit. I just made 450 bitcoins!

Apparently the average IQ of the readers of my previous post is below 80, as they downvote it, thinking I was serious. I was being sarcastic. You're a complete moron if you give your do what the OP describes...

Confirmed by who? O, I see it is a quality article from the world famous, elite newspaper ''Crypto Crimson.com''. 
It seems they managed to publish this premium news even before the amateurs at Goldman Sachs, or the Wall Street Journal. It must be real :).

That's not up to me, we decide about that together. I wish we had the faith in MtGox to give them another few weeks, but we have already made the preparations, and more action will be taken on Wednesday.

Replies like this aren't helping anyone either. Two of us (not me) are going to Japan this Tuesday &amp; preparations for filing it are already made. I don't expect this to go 'public' (as in, media) until Thursday, as it will be filed on Wednesday. 
We are still looking for people who have $10K or more trapped in MtGox, as that will make our case stronger.
Please send me a PM.

We don't know even know if we will get anything back at all. If we act now, there is a chance we might get some of OUR money back. If we wait too long, and MtGox files bankruptcy or suddenly goes offline, then it will be harder to act as by that point, all their assets could be gone. Including our money AND bitcoins. 
Everyone in our group wants one thing: our money back. To us, it's not 'a game' anymore. If MtGox does go bankrupt, we will lose our money, which will cause real financial troubles. Do you think people who have invested a lot of money into an exchange which is about to go bankrupt, care about media coverage? We are already experiencing the negative consequences of MtGox's poor management and probable bankruptcy. You will never know how it feels like when you're about to lose tens of thousands of dollars. 
I read some reports about MtGox reinstating withdrawals. Well, nothing of that is true (unfortunately). I tried it several times a day this week, without success. To us, the bitcoin price on MtGox doesn't really matter anymore. 
We don't take the risk to buy bitcoins on MtGox, even if it is only worth $10. Because if we do buy bitcoins on MtGox when they are $10, and if MtGox suddenly goes offline and/or files bankruptcy, then we will never get our money back as we bought bitcoins with it. So everyone is staying in USD, the bitcoins on MtGox don't really matter anymore...

I guess you don't have tens of thousands of USD on MtGox? If you would, you would try to get it back. The current situation is really stressful for us..
