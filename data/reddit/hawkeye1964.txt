And they expire Friday, so buy like mad until then, then sell at 9k next week, wait until the end of December and do it again.

 He “won” 500k. He will see maybe 300k after the tax man is done with him then he will pay more tax at the end of the year leaving him with 250k.
 Where do you think he can invest 250k for it to produce 5k a month in revenue?

I hear you. I’m easily in the top 5% and I’m quite content to stay right there. I know I have more wealth than most and I’m fine with a few having riches I can’t even imagine. 
I trade BTC to make a profit in fiat and if someday it takes me to a higher tax bracket than I’m currently in then good for me and BTC. 
This schmuck can call me a peasant all day long if he wants, but I’m not the one that’s going to be working until he’s 70+ and still doesn’t have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.

 Because you’re too fucking dumb to understand that just because the Nazis used “socialist” in their name doesn’t make them socialists.

I’m 55, wife Is 50 and our two kids are 17 and 15. We have a few more years of work in front of us. Both kids will have their undergrad paid for by us and paying for health insurance on your own is expensive.
We are both engineering professionals and really enjoy our jobs— we also know that once we retire we draw down on our savings rather than add 60k a year to it as we are doing now.

If your net worth is greater than 4200 USD, you’re in the top 50% in the world. Have 100K to your name? Congrats! You’re in the top 10%. 
Have 880K? Now you’re in the top 1% richest in the world.
