I appreciated the original posters comments. I read the entire thread and not one person provided a rebuttal. All I saw were comments like "If you spent any time researching...". Why aren't those people able to articulate their own research into a response that makes sense.
The utility of Crypto still eludes me. One gets nothing of value best I can tell unless you are measuring value from a speculation perspective where you buy and hope someone else will pay you more. That might result in value to you, or a loss of value. If the coins were tied to a stake in whatever they represent, that might be valuable to me of I liked the cause. Someone who has done this "Research", please respond with the same clarity as the original poster.

I am not using a personal account. I am using a checking account tied to an LLC. Any recommendations for banks that support this type of business checking and are crypto friendly?

I think the OP is asking for back recommendations that are ok with opening a business checking account that will be wiring or ACH transferring monies to and from crypto-exchanges.

He did not leave the laptop open. He was using it and the police distracted him with a couple fighting. They grabbed the laptop before he could lock it, and he knew he was busted.

Dont you still have to write down your phrase? 
What if youre hit by a bus or die?
Your family loses those assets. 
Also, they should support many more cryptos.
