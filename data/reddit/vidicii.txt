Never said something different ;)
For some ppl even a vacation for 2000 is hugh. 
I have a similar opinion like u i guess, just that it sounded like u pressume he has mortgage and depts. In general it is wiser (more wise?) to pay those things first. But like i said, if he has a steady income alrdy planed for a mortgage why not just spend all additional money for some fun things. 
u can also see it from another view, without BTC he would be in the same place just without a nice car and he would still be able to survive (...hopefully) :P :)

You could always safe money....why buying a home? why living in a rented apartement when u can sleep under a bridge with a piece of paper to safe money? 
Some ppl like cars, some ppl like holidays, some ppl like work, some ppl like not to work. Everyone has different goals.
Maybe he doesn't have mortgage, maybe he likes to work and his monthly income is enough for him...why not just spend the money for some "toy" to have some fun? :)

Well for sure it's a pretty bad decision to buy a expensive car if u barely can afford some food for example...but i wouldn't assume he has high mortgage to pay. ofcourse it makes more sense to pay those things before buying such a car.
But if he has other ways to pay that mortgage like a well-payed and "safe" job (or just don't have mortgage ;)), why not have some fun with that car....others going on vacation even if they have mortgage/depts to pay. or buying iphones instead of an older samsung for 10% of the prize. 
personally i would ofc pay my depts before buying such a car...if i had any.

That's right, i just wouldn't assume that all ppl have depts :)

Why does it have to be economical? Just because you want? ;)
Different people, different goals, different lifestyle, different hobbies.
