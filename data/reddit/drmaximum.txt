I strongly suspect the intention of that article is to misinform, rather then to inform..
There's so many false claims and spins in the article, that it almost has to be done on purpose ! ( not talking about the $10 thing, there's lots of **false** "facts" in it as well !! )

What does that mean ? bitcoindays destroyed ??

in Europe there's also a huge counterfit problem, yet
these notes have lots of anti counterfit measres
that means the counterfit problem in USA must be absolutly EPIC.. !
I mean, the notes are easy to copy, they look fucking monopoly money
I sure do love that money green look, it gives bitcoin a HUGE advantage !
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:46:48
anyone know why you can't get a btc/€ graph for bitstamp ?
( they are europe based after all )

So Mt.Gox parent company [bought]( the domain **gox.com**...  Just like it said in the "leaked or fake??" [crises strategy plan](
note : a 3 letter domain is not cheap..
Edit : spell check

here's a noob question :
where's that chart coming from ? it's seems not to be from BTC-E itself ?
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:47:58
**Holy SHIT !** 
[Confirmed]( the sale is coming from mark karpales !

on a serious note:
you could try mega.co.nz , as it is heavily encrypted, supposedly even for mega themselves, and should be pretty hacker proof then
they likely won't ever (can?) scan for illegal files
however, keep in mind the last cloud venture of kim.com got taken down by law enforcement ( all files lost for every user )

anaccountjustforyou, you're naive, real life is not Disney Land
Whatsapp is worth 19 billion to fb, because fb is in such a position that that app will (likely) easily pay for itself.
If you think that sum is somehow out of touch with reality, that's to bad. In the free market world that you love and live in things do not work any other way. It's like the laws of physics, they're unavoidable.
If you can't live with this, finding a nice communist regime to live in could be a solution for you :-)

Nice and so easy !
Belgium is lagging behind with e-shops in general, refreshing to see a idea like this happening

good guy greg

everyone who owns a bitcion should be pushing this !
 ( doesn't matter where it's stored, bitcoin's reputation needs this !! )

sign it already, pretty sure  they won't stop it votes once they've hit 100

pretty useless because you're defeating the purpose of a paper key ( witch is safty )
but ! ...if you have to,
- save the image as ONE singe frame still, lasting for 0.04 seconds in a .mp4 / divx movie
- choose movie with adam sandler in it, put frame near end of movie
- heavily encrypt the file,
- save it in a password protected .rar file ( esentially encrypting it again )
- then hide in another file, named "setup.exe"
- put "setup.exe" in some submap of a real linux .iso
- put "linux.iso" in sub- sub- sub- map in a bestiality porn collection, HD images only
- compress all this in a .rar file named "2goats.1cup.rar", 
- again, use password protection, 50 characters minimum
- last but not least: make file hidden in windows 8 folder options
- when uploading the file wrap your head in aluminum foil
.. you should be ok now
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:55:09
no it just looks kinda like it
this one is way cleaner
tradingview does not has yellow bars
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:22:56
It will help to solid facebooks position on the social media market
If that wasn't worth 19bil to fb, then they woulnd't have bought it
Nobody made them buy it. A product is worth whatever anyone is willing to pay for it. Whatsapp was worth 19bil.

Startups like this could really help Bitcoin on the road to mainstream adaption

Well look dude, they're not exactly random bits, it's fucking CP.. you don't get that by accident, and some child needed to be abused in order to get the bit's in that specific order
It's not just "a certain arrangement of bits" it's a **specific arrangement of bits** representing stuff that should be fucking illegal, and you know it !!!
@_date: 2015-04-12 00:57:41
Wrong, am afraid your logic is compromised by your intelligence..
First of all, the image  is a problem for the victim. I don't think he/she would like nudes (or worse) of him/her floating around on the internet. That's enough reason for illegality already.
Furthermore, if the images weren't illegal, more people would wank on child porn because they know they wont get in trouble over just owning the image. So there would be a bigger demand for these images, a market even, and that would mean lot's more abuse.
It makes absolutely no sense to make the abuse illegal, but not the pictures of it. That would be [hypocritical](
So yes, a "random arrangements of bits" that represent real life CP, should be illegal.

Youn eed to shut up now,  as that's obviously what I meant

All depends on how fast &amp; easy your client can buy bitcoins in Egypt..
Tell them big companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Dell and even Paypall use bitcoin to **transfer** money ( they themselves don't actually accept BTC )...client's simply pay Coinbase or Bitpay, and they in turn transfer USD to Microsoft, Dell, ...
 so it might be worth looking into at the very least
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:11:21
I am sorry I have disappointed you

20 years ago, there was people laughing at this new concept of "the internet"... 
They claimed that nobody would keep using it, as we actually don't really have anything meaningful to say to each other...
