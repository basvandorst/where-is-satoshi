so relevant

What isyour point? I don't really like bankers either. Still they contribute much more to the economy than a guy who mined 60 000 coins in the early days of a currency...

bill gates actually created value. bitcoin is just a currency and there is no legitimate reason for an early adopter of a currency to become the richest man in the world

obviously you are right. still, do you realize the huge advantage relatively to the effort ? it's nonsense and problematic. the kind of power a massive adoption of btc would give to a few unknown early adopters is completely unethical and potentially very dangerous

plus, most of the advantages would actually dilute, at least relatively, with a massive adoption, which is not the case with btc, where the finite amount of coins would actually enforce the unfair advantage over the time... this is what i don't like and fear

i disagree : one of the reasons i don't encourage btc is exactly because  it's an unfair advantage to early adopters. (in spite of being one myself, it stands against what i believe in). I don't think bitcoin will have people adhesion if it create filthy rich people out of nowhere.

You make this argumentative mistake :  pointing the flaws of the current situation (and assuming your interlocutor accepts it as it is) do not make any alternative a good one. Plus it is disrespectful to your interlocutors to assume opinions or ignorance

yes it is. clearly blockchain technology is amazing.

some kind of inflation would solve the problem. (but it's a bad word over here.) i'm all for crypto/decentralized. I just don't like the lack of inflation of btc, as i value inflation for diluting the power of any fiat holder and reducing the weight of debt over time
@_date: 2016-01-08 18:53:06
I perfectly understand the problems of capitalism, thank you. while i think decentralized currencies are an amazing step in the right direction, i do not believe btc itself or any deflationary model would be a suitable model. On the contrary I'm convinced it would be way worse
