I didn't say "soon", but that depends on your definition of soon. I'm talking 12-18months... but could be sooner/later.  What makes me think this? It would require a market cap of 50Billion to reach 1,000/ltc, only 100B for 2,000/ltc.  SOOOOO much money sitting on the sidelines from Wall-Street just waiting to get in the game. That's what...

Buy lots of LTC and ride the wave of %2000 gains once again!

Consider LTC, it's due for massive increases as it becomes accessible for everyday use. You can get several whole coins!

You'll soon be able to do everything in the cash app, by Square. It also allows you a personalized debit card. Look into it.

Buy LTC! With the news today about successful atomic swaps, LTC has a ton of growth potential.

I don't see why more people don't think like this. Something something, paradigm shift.
BTC + LTC = Money 2.0
Litecoin - The cryptocurrency for everyday payments!

Hold, things are gonna get a lot worse for non-coin holders. Just keep living your life, don't draw attention. Buy lots of LTC, it compliments BTC.

Dropping truth bombs!

Not possible, they declared the issue fixed. You all must be lying, fake news!!  /s

I think that's a crazy move given the off the charts movement of BCH today. Sit on your windfall and see how high the rocket goes!

"slow" in that it shoots up reliably and doesn't give you ulcers. Honestly though, as you did around, you'll understand LTC and BTC are fully joined through Charlie Lee and the core devs for BTC. LTC is set to be a Moon shot after today's news sinks in about the lighting network and it's implications to scale to be the world currency. We are witnessing historic times. Strap in!!

Look into LTC, has potential to have gains in the 200-300% range over the next year. For BTC to make same gains, it would need to hit 16k and 24k

Bullshit, Banks use fractional reserve lending to "loan" people money. They make money out of thin air! No reason they actually need my money to lend to someone. This isn't "It's a wonderful Life" anymore. Things have changed drastically since that movie was made.
