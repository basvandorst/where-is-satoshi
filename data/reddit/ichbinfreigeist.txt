"Pretend" it is not pretending it is assuming. I might die tmr but that doesn't mean I will prepare for it now unless I see major problems like end-stage cancer, right now we (HODLers) do not see any real problem with Bitcoin. Hence we "pretend" that this can't go on forever. If we are wrong then that's that, and we all know it can happen. Just like we all know we will probably die someday.

He wants weak hands to give him more of their coins, Roger the charlatan and his friends already infested BCH and compromised it by owning above 50%. He will continue the pump and dump until nothing is left.

We all know about the fee's. The increased number of posts about the fee's are obviously propaganda. BCH has less fee's currently, that means what? From a technical standpoint not much.
BTC will not hardfork for a short term solution. And BCH will have the same problem. Yes BCH can just Kang any solution as many have written, but that isn't the spirit of open source is it?
Bitcoin can easily do a fork and increase blocksize, the reason it does not is because it is not a solution.

Accurate. BCH is compromised since the majority is owned by scoundrels Roger Ver &amp; Friends.
And they keep accumulating and increasing their wealth.

BTC will not do a hardfork for a short term solution. You want to use it now? Good go use any altcoin that has not reached the wall yet. In the meantime those who support crypto and the technology will not care about winning a lambo but about furthering the cause.
What should BTC do? A hardfork and change the plan to increasing blocksize? That is not the solution and WE WILL NOT HARDFORK for a temporary solution, if a hardfork is done it will be for more than just blocksize.

I believe all transactions ever made are on all "full nodes" that have a backup of the whole blockchain.

Roger and his charlatan friends gonna dump their coins and after he stole his gullible followers and FOMO'ers money he gonna buy low and repeat again.

Do not get confused, despite the propaganda Bitcoin / BTC is the newest version of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash / BCH is a hardfork of an older version.
If all the issues are solved by changing one value in the code BTC will do the change sooner or later, the reason they did not is because most likely simply increasing blocksize is not a long term scaling solution.
If you want to invest in an altcoin there are many I would recommend over BCH (I would not recommend BCH as it is controlled by Roger Ver and friends and is not useful anymore due to 50%+ being owned by manipulators).
WTC, ADA, ETH, XRB are all good choices.

What is the point of telling your parents? Keep it to yourself and enjoy when you need it.
I only see downsides of telling your parents, especially if you have siblings...

Bitcoin Kang - if there is innovation in Bitcoin Core, we can still copy it! You have no advantage!
Join us in giving Roger the king of (big) blockheads all of our money!

Yes, all the scaling solutions where solved by replacing 1024 with 8192 in the code. /s
- Welcome to Bitcoin Kang - we offer no solution, but we will Kang the solutions when others create them, until then we use bigger blocks!

Convicted felon Roger Ver told them it is okay to give him more of their money. Tbh I think the majority loses money in his repeated pump &amp; dumps, there is simply a small group of spammers/shills/paids/Roger accounts @ that are making it seem like there is money to be gained in bcash, most are losing though, only if you know beforehand you can make money, the majority loses. Roger and his friends control too much of bcash, it is not a useful currency anymore.

Because Roger is spamming reddit with his many accounts, he is not a mature grown up as he has shown time and time again.
Those posts are propaganda to steal more money via BCash pump and dump from his followers.
