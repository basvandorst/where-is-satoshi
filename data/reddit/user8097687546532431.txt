Mass adoption right around the corner!

The Blockchain is public... every bitcoin transaction ever... and it was just used to send someone to prisson for life. At least with a bank account they need a subpoena.
@_date: 2015-06-14 21:23:30


Oh lest us forget - those are going down too! Merchants are dropping BTC left and right because no one uses it, and every other day in here there's a post about someone getting hacked followed by a thousand "WELL you *should* have used a PC that has NEVER been connected to the internet and then cover it in concrete and blast it into orbit - otherwise you're just asking to lose your coin!"
BTC has one use case: drugs. More power to you if that's how you want to live your life, but I wouldn't hold my breath for the price ever going up again.
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:00:22
Yeah not like you guys - sending emails to German pizza companies.
@_date: 2015-06-06 23:01:28


What? My landlord and I have the same bank, at the beginning of the month I *instantly* transferred rent from my account to theirs (i no longer had access to the money, they could instantly spend theirs). How big of a *fee* would I have to pay to get my confirmation anywhere near "fast" with BTC?
BTC has become this idealized flagship product of how great the world will be once "fiat collapses" but for now, I feel even the truest of believers should be able to admit, it's nowhere near as convenient/fast/reliable to use as fiat.
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:27:19
It doesn't. It relates to Libertarians and ancaps who have co-opped the tech and this sub.
@_date: 2015-06-28 05:17:20


and here i thought this was a place for discussion, including dissenting opinions. so make all non-believers wear juden stars? what about liberty?
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:56:04
Funny, I don't remember the whole of society and all its problems being on trial here. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:41:08
I think even if you love bitcoin it would be hard to not find this hilarious.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:33:40
ITT: Insane Libertarian rhetoric defending a drug kingpin who made jokes about making heroin easy to access for recovering addicts, allowed the sale of narcotics to 16 year old kids, and tried to put a hit out on someone that stole money from him.
If this is the hero of bitcoin you might as well throw in the towel for mass adoption. You have a right to believe what you want to believe, but the average person has no sympathy for drug dealers who act like they're above the law. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:18:45
Just because you think a law is unfair doesn't mean you have the right to break it without consequence. You not having the right to shove a heroin needle in your arm isn't in the same ballpark, league, or even in the same game as being denied a seat on a bus because of the color of your skin.
One is an actual injustice, the other is just contrary to a law put in place for the betterment of society. I know you're probably a Libertarian and believe everyone should have the right to do anything they want - but that would include the right to deny someone a seat on a bus because of the color of their skin.
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:58:39
Wow, aren't you a smart lil thief.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:58:11
Selling drugs imported from cartels is not a victimless crime. Just because you remove the street dealer from the equation does not change the trail of violence that lead to your door.
@_date: 2015-05-09 21:45:16
It's not like using the internet in 1977. It's like using bitcoin in 2015.
@_date: 2015-05-27 22:59:28
doctors don't serve heroin to 16 year old kids.

Reminds me of The Office, when Michael Scott stands on a desk and yells "I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!!"
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:27:26
I don't think that was the point. I think the point the judge was making was that no one is above the law.




@_date: 2015-05-22 23:07:12
Bitcoin gets inflated and stolen but it's from private individuals/companies. I guess that's better than the gov'ment to libertarians though.
Edit: lots of downvotes but am I wrong?
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:55:11
Didn't you hear? There's a WOMAN at the helm of reddit. That SLUT is behind all of this.
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:21:09
How about the electricity and and internet infrastructure required to even USE bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-10 17:56:37
The real question is, will they still be your friend after you coerce them into using bitcoin for your own benefit?
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:59:51
wow did you just admit to being a drug/CP dealer who uses his poor grandma as cover? yeah i bet those dumbass FBI dudes will be like "yeah the trail leads to this old woman, guess we should just give up." what a heartless idiot you are.
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:19:43
just like Ross did am i right! using a family member as cover isn't going to do much to throw off the scent though - might as well go the full nine and befriend/murder a homeless person and steal their identity if you REALLY want to keep the heat away from you am i right? you are good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-02 22:19:17
What gives BTC its value? Oh right, the fact that it's exchangeable for fiat. Without that you have nothing - even the DNM people hate dealing with it and they are the only ones who have so far found a legitimate use for BTC.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:56:06
And yet, here you are...
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:23:58
Kind of like Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:53:40
It boggles my mind how the tech fringe of bitcoin can get behind such an anti-science candidate like this.
@_date: 2015-04-20 06:30:36
Citation needed.
@_date: 2015-04-22 06:44:20
And yet there's a post on the top of the front page right now this very moment about the NSA that has far less to do with bitcoin that any altcoin... selective moderation to enforcing the Libertarian viewpoint.
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:41:43
Woah, what happened here?
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:17:49
The internet won't be anarchy if Paul gets in office, kills net neutrality, and allows ISPs to throttle any kind of traffic they want. But regulation is always bad right?
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:02:44
Am I allowed to like bitcoin but not be a delusional, greedy, selfish, libertarian asshole?
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:19:29
I dunno, embraced him - even sent business his way. The whole "buttcoin" mod was literally a joke (he had the ability to assign flair only). 
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:15:56
They are real issues. They get "shut down" because of the delicate balance of the supreme court. Putting a GOP suit in the white house is playing a dangerous game that could upset that balance.

@_date: 2015-04-24 16:12:48
I'm sorry but that is all conjecture. There's no way you can convince me that a government mandate to treat all bandwidth equally is a bad thing. I want the FCC to exist which is just a fundamental difference in our ideologies.

So... you guys think charge backs are a good thing?
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:14:38


This is simply not probably/possible. TWC, Verizon, and Comcast have this country in their grip, without regulatory action to ensure equal treatment of all web traffic we find ourselves in an anti-competitive entanglement and tiered payment plans. It'd be great if the free market could all decide to not use Comcast but the reality is in most markets there *isn't* a choice.

The government needs to stand up for the disenfranchised. Protecting the right to have a clean, safe abortion is a moral duty of the federal government.
Also - "They thought all along that they could call me a libertarian and hang that label around my neck like an albatross, but I'm not a libertarian." -Rand Paul

Ahhh I forgot - Libertarians only answer to inherited wealth and personal greed. I'm sorry, you have yours, so fuck everyone else - got it.

"Netflix should give me the ability to pay a small monthly fee to be able to download every TV show and movie in their collection. I value art so little that I would only be willing to pay $9 for every film and TV show ever made.
Actually no, I value art so little that I'm not willing to pay for it at all. Netflix sucks I'm going back to TBP."

He's not a libertarian.

"Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth." If we delegate every social issue to the state we'll not only promote more social injustice for the disenfranchised, we'll create greater racial and social divides. America has be stay the slightest bit socially progressive if it wants to keep up with rest of the world.

Where does the delusion come from that it's people's constitutional right to be able to copy and distribute other people's work for free? You're just trying to justify piracy like any other dickhead who refuses to pay artists.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:14:19
My bad! I honestly didn't notice. On that one, thank you.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:53:24
This is where I see a use for bitcoin - digital transactions for digital content. I find these uses far more compelling than the idealistic fantasies and 20 minute checkout times at the groceries. Even in an area where "bank account penetration" is insanely high, it'd be nice to let my cash be my cash and my bitcoin be my internet money.
@_date: 2015-04-21 22:03:32
So are only positive posts and comments allowed going forward ala Hashtalk? I've seen some pretty vitriolic stuff directed towards the so-called "payed MasterCard shills" who speak about Bitcoin's flaws in this sub ("suck federal reserve cock" and the doxxing of your former mod come to mind). Did you take disciplinary action against those members of your community?
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:03:15
Where is the mention of bitcoin in this article?
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:54:58
Supreme Court nominations are the most powerful and long lasting effect a president can have on the country. Their stance on social issues IS important. I cannot believe anyone would be stupid enough to support a republican (unless they have direct ties to the military industrial complex and or are in the richest 1%). 
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:34:18


So pulling out derogatory slurs directed specifically to the fact that she's a woman doesn't equate to contempt?
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:52:21
They honestly believe that we attempt to disrupt their "community" lol - there's no conspiracy. Go to buttcoin and you'll just find a bunch of np links to this sub. They really don't understand that they are hilarious enough on their own. We don't need to do any extra trolling.

By inflating the military and starting some more illegal wars while increasing the tax burden on those who can't shoulder it? Yeah totally, we definitely need the GOP right now...

You're joking right?

We don't make plans to prank - all we have to do is link to the crazy shit you people say for our entertainment. Take a look at this post and the fact that people are actually taking it seriously here - who are the crazy ones exactly?

It's sad how people (especially men on reddit) don't understand how when they use words like cunt, bitch, slut, and whore casually towards women it sounds like nigger, chink, spic etc. to anyone with an ounce of self awareness.
