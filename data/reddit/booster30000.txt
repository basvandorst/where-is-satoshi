Why is it that the moment I opened this Imgur link, Sophos immediately said, "threat detected"?
I'd be suspicious of OP right now.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:13:58
And why is that?
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:00:11
Begging for abuse and you'll all see soon. Coinbase will be compromised very soon, and the very blockchain will too.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:18:18
My thoughts exactly, he must be trying to get away from it all
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:08:13
Selling files? This is stupid. Just fucking idiotic. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:51:02
Your sister is an idiot.
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:51:21
Google maps it. Ask for Regesh (At least that's how I think it's pronounced)
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:15:16
Funny how you used that last word to describe yourself.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:57:36
You missed the point
@_date: 2014-01-08 23:00:38
It's made by a Reddit so it's like, LE EDGY
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:21:27
Can't wait for Bitcoin to be worth absolutely nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D:D:D:D:D:D :D :D :D
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:39:50
So it's a scam?
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:43:49
Why? Of course not.
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:51:56
Kill yourself. Call them and ask for the manager and simply ask the question, "Will you take BTC later?"
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:45:04
Couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:57:53
Multiple inputs and outputs begs for abuse.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:02:59
When a transaction does not depend on multiple inputs and outputs, then we have a fan-out. It's the need to depend on multiple inputs and outputs that's the problem. Once we have enough of those, then shit hits the fan. We need a certain volume before Bitcon can be majorly abused.

@_date: 2014-02-10 21:21:28
Precisely. So if I buy a Bitcoin, not only am I paying a 1% fee but I'm also paying 10 extra dollars. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:36:43
I've got an install on my university. Perhaps it just went crazy for no reason.

Transactions containing multiple inputs and outputs begs for a major abuse of the system.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:11:04
Bitcoins are worth 800, lets say and you want to buy one. 
Coinbase says you can buy one for $820, except they charge a 1% fee. So, in total you end up buying a Bitcoin for around $828, when in reality, it's worth $800. They did charge you 1%, but they value their Bitcoins higher than the exchanges do.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:14:24
Bitcoin is a scam
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:11:20
Bitcoin is having a sale! Get them cheap coins while you can!
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:07:30
...? What does how well you understand it have to do with anything? Are you trying to implying that because satoshi white paper is easier to understand is what makes it somehow better? If that is the case, then I suggest you go back to high school where you belong.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:25:54
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:43:16
It's already failed. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:15:02
Get the fuck out of here
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:12:50
At least they pay for that.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:16:48
I'm a dinosaur because I believe in Bitcoin? Are you an idiot?
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:23:13
But it is
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:48:46
I'm sure it was, too. What a piece of shit.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:08:37
Still, for most people it is simply not reasonable. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:22:59
You're right.
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:14:18
I just went outside and asked two people if they've ever heard of Bitcoin.
They both said no and started walking away. One of them turned around as he walked away and asked what it was. I gave a brief description and he said the concept was stupid. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:39:34
Shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:58:41
It's not 1%. That's what they say, but it's not really that.
Yeah, guys! Buy Bitcoin at 830 ea with a 1% fee! It's great!
**Bitcoin is $805, not $830**
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:27:28
Hey, thanks so much dude! 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:13:14
You can't even spell "smarter" you sad fuck.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:59:43
Not using a rune pickaxe? What a noob
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:31:42
What genus of disturbed, DT-ridden Muse rattles through the chambers of your vacant head? Here, I've got a better question for you to ask and it is, "Who should I kill?" and of course, I'm going to give you the answer you deserve and the one you expect and that is, "yourself". 
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:21:07
Me? Lying?
@_date: 2014-01-17 05:24:27
That's because you're making the mistake of selling when it's already low instead of selling when it's high
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:17:36
Coinbase and Blockchain are two different things.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:53:45
But they do. You and I both know it's Opensource and you and I both know the giant problem Bitcoin's protocol has that nobody seems to speak of.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:11:44
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:07:56
Oh no, he's right! He must be trolling!
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:59:16
Not at all
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:14:50
So am I what?
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:13:23
I agree, this sub has constanipoled under it's own heavy stratum, the likes of which irritate me.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:59:33
Because of them, Bitfinex users were fucked. Read up on it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:14:00
Become a troll yourself?
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:13:22
Wow...you're creepy.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:27:35
just a little
@_date: 2014-01-16 04:26:57
He makes a good point. They could just receive more BTC with other generated adresses and loophole around their limits.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:32:33
a fuckton
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:59:10
They do not charge 1%, they're charging way more than that.
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:07:01
Yes there are. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:40:50
Quit treating btc like shares. They aren't. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:45:12
1. Taking the money directly sounds a lot easier than all of that.
2. As a regular person I don't care if I'm tracked, I have nothing to hide. Also, I have not paid a single fee ever with my bank. So you're wrong.
3. Except I can make money using USD by placing it in my bank account and letting the intended rise. I can't put bitcoin in a bank account.
4. Link me to a bitcoin credit card if that is true
5. Yes but in real life transactions , a card is easier than btc. I'm not talking about online.
And it does matter. Without regular people support, bitcoin won't make it far.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:15:06
I'm sure this is a scam. Downvote this.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:52:43
That is a link to a bitcoin credit card, link me to a bitcoin credit card that I can use anywhere
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:40:00
You didn't even read my post and I didn't lose any money with BTC. So you're wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:49:44
You obviously didn't read the post
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:39:44
Cute post
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:38:27
Explain why they are naive and dumb as shit because all I feel from reading your comment are the rumblings of a mad man who has lost a good chunk of his money.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:55:48
If it doesn't exist at this very moment then it's pointless
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:22:38
AHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH
