So how do you differentiate between a troll who says he's a Bitcoin millionaire and the real deal?
I'm guessing a lot of people are having fun concocting stories about how they made "millions" with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is like owning your own bank. It's not for the faint of heart. If I had a substantial amount of bitcoin (which I sadly dont), I would try to keep it offline. Stored on paper or maybe something more durable like a strip of metal I could carve my seed into.
Not that the risk of it being stolen is unacceptably high. It has more to do with peace of mind.
The only problem is generating the private key which probably has to be done on a computer. That computer should never ever touch a network connection of any kind of course.

Couldn't agree more. I don't want to rub it in, buy leaving thousands of dollars in bitcoin on a Internet connected computer is tempting fate.
If I were to buy over $1000 worth of bitcoin I would make sure they got transfered to either a cold wallet for a higher amount or at least an air gapped laptop that can be used to securely sign transactions.
Maybe even split the total amount on several cold wallets for damage control and store them in a bank deposit box.
When dealing with bit coin at this stage it's easy to go wrong. I have a reasonably good idea about bitcoin but when dealing with high amounts of bitcoin it can't hurt to search around and find a reasonably secure way of dealing with them.
