if it has a psychological effect on mass bitcoin users then it will.  Last time we had a hard fork there was no warning and it was taken care of pretty efficiently.  There was little effect in the price.  Hopefully this time will be the same.  But long story short: It could but it might not.

What can the average user do to help stabilize the value of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:09:15
That's some future shit we got right here 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:38:19
yes.  i am pretty sure whoever made this meme organized the crash to buy in.  I regret buying in a 170 right now.  but i am still thinking positively about it.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:20:52
Precisely 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:07:53
I buy it.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:27:50
Look like I bought the same time Colbert did 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:51:52
I really just want to exchange my bitcoin elsewhere. Do my part to decentralize the market.
@_date: 2013-09-04 05:17:24
ok, I found a usb with a wallet code on it hopefully its the right one.  I just have to wait for it to catch up 105 weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:33:34
Was it team rocket?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:42:34
Is there a way to create a P2P exchange network. I know the price would be higher and it would be less risky.  they do this on the silk road but i want to do it in a less sketchy way.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:08:11
I understand your point, I just don't like how much of the market they exchange. It kind of takes away how powerful the bitcoin can really be if we all trade with them.  I have already invested all I am with bitcoin for now, but my mom asked me to buy here some. So I am not too concerned about trading fees.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:39:58
I know. Lost 7.4 BTC
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:48:52
But how do I raise the price?
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:42:38
It has never not been a 24 limit for me and I cannot figure out how to do the 5 day transaction. Any help? I could use mt gox but I feel like there is too much dependence on it..
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:37:45
Have you used those sites? I am trying to get back to bitcoin. i used mt gox last year but i am trying to find a faster way to buy them
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:29:00
It is important to read this comment in its entirety 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:45:24
I deny any claim of that
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:25:08
7.4 as of Last Thursday.  Loving it. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:38:12
So soon there will be another bubble ten times as big?  I'm on board.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:18:16
So i need to use transferwise to send USD to them and they transfer it to euros then bitcoins?  
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:57:56
Very true.  This is a pretty subjective question.  I just wanted to know if there were some good alternatives that I was somehow missing.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:21:18
Trying to save post on mobile.  
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:05:32
What? that did not happen to me. bought at 170....
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:53:51
Buy in right now.  You won't regret it.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:59:02
That's how I feel about all this. Self for filling proficy
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:33:16
I didn't sell because I used fucking coinbase to buy mine and the transaction didnt complete until today.  But I'm in to to win it.  I'm going to buy some more. What network other than mt gox is good for US transactions?
@_date: 2013-03-11 03:18:14
Diablo wont work for me, it wants to open in xtools. And i dont see any sort of progress on bitcoinplus. Is this normal?
@_date: 2013-04-27 08:42:15
But how do we know the price equilibrium?
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:36:52
Yeah. I want these prices to do something.  This isn't it is it?  I thought bitcoins were worth more than that. Maybe I should take out a loan. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:16:29
Do i have to have a Bank of America account or can i withdraw my funds from my bank, drive to BofA and deposit it there?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:12:08
They fucked me too.  I got market value of they day I made the transaction not the market value of the day i received them.
@_date: 2013-09-24 03:59:44
are you my mummy?
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:44:16
This is what I was going to say.  Looks like a great time to buy more coming up!
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:23:52
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:34:01
Bitcoins could save the economy, but I'm not behind them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:46:17
So are all these sites down a cause or an effect or the current market value?
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:08:07
I'm only 20 and I had my dad give me my money for Christmas to buy bitcoins.  Best gift I ever received.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:01:23
What is the process of sending usd to bitstamp in order to buy?
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:34:54
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:00:16
You should have given her a taller piece of paper
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:59:54
Thats my plan for now.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:38:38
Buck o five sounds a bout right.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:15:20
So i think we are in need of a /bitcoincirclejerk
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:04:32
No karma whoring unless you have a funny picture. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:03:01
I think it makes me sound badass to have bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:02:26
Ready when you are captain. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:23:35
Sounds like the best choice so far
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:55:33
I got tired of dwolla and my gox. I use coinbase the verification doesn't take as long. But it would till take 2-3 days if you start now.
