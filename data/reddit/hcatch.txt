Cool idea, nice execution. 
"If you bought Bitcoin whenever Google trends was uptrending and sold when it started to go down starting on 2017-01-01 with $100, today you would own 0.05 Bitcoin worth $202.61."
But if you bought and held that $100 buy you'd have $400+?

Double spending? Accounted for. Only one transaction will get verified.

Because it’s another alt coin? Lots of good ones out there. They all compete in the alt coin market. None of them compete with bitcoin.

Good stuff. But what’s up with the possessive ‘s use for plurals?

How did you lose BTC on Breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:54:04
Bread gives you a choice between normal and Economy fees. 
Edit: sorry, you said desktop. Bread is iOS.

At your service.

I think he means Osama. Though that piece of correction does no go far in helping this guy make sense. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:17:50
I may have misunderstood your original question. Please do explain further.
Coinbase is an exchange. Your things are in a wallet on Coinbase. You would be sending your funds from Coinbase wallet to your Bread wallet. So, normal wallet-to-wallet transaction rules apply.

Let us know how that text conversation with your wife goes. Post screenshots (minus names)

fair enough. I think of r/bitcoin as my main crypto subreddit sometimes. This may be better suited in r/CryptoCurrency

“Bitcoin is an incredible idea. And I do believe that has an incredible future. However, due to the over-hyping of the market, I am led to believe that a crash is almost inevitable. “
What does that even mean..
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:14:45
You are probably right. No big deal either way. But I'm testing your theory with an edit in r/cryptocurrency.

I’m no math wizard, but I’d say roughly $362 USD worth. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:09:14
I'm with you. Though I think beyond ye ol' schadenfreude, there's a benefit to bitcoin in watching forks atrophy. Sends a message to future potential contentious forks.

I’m a fan of Sam Harris, and would love to listen to him having a conversation about cryptocurrency and blockchain. (Just to provide counter balance to the other comment)

This is clearly intended as humor. None of the previous commenters see this?
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:56:26
Uhm no it’s not.
