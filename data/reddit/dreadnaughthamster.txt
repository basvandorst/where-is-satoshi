Does this mean Bitcoin Cash is going to burst out of his stomach?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:53:19
So... basically... no one really knows.
Here's my prediction:
I predict Bitcoin may or may not hit $20k and may or may not rise as high as $100k but it may or may not also crash to $2.

^This. Wild Wild West right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:29:32
It's sort of like the beginnings of the stock market. Right now it's like the Wild Wild West. You have to protect yourself right now because otherwise you can very easily lose your coins.
Getting a Ledger Nano S or Trezor Wallet is a good start. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:57:38
Sorry to be someone else to rain on your parade but you should take your coins out of Coinbase and put them either in a paper wallet or a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S or Trezor. And always do it in small increments. Crypto is volatile, unstable, and does not hold your hand. You can get fucked for lots of money if you're not careful.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:05:06
Thanks. Been wondering this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:29:23
Looking nice! Always keep asking yourself "is there a way I can make this cleaner, simpler?"
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:27:44

Wow. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:18:20
I bet in five years there'll be two or three that will be very worthwhile. The problem is getting the right ones. For example, I could see great value in Alt coins that form a decentralized exchange, but those are still in their infancy. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:25:33
I don't know if going a full $100 per paycheck is too risky for you, but I'm glad you're not going all in. At the very least, dipping your feet in with a small amount like you mentioned and maybe using $100 or so to buy a Ledger Nano S and a couple Bitcoin books and experimenting with purchasing Bitcoin and putting it on a hardware wallet could be a very beneficial learning experience. It seems like you have a good amount of restraint and are eager to learn how to do it, so I wish you luck and success.
Not to mention, once you become good at the process, you could start up another part-time job charging like $20/hr teaching and tutoring other people how to do it (just make sure you always preface each class with "I'm not a financial advisor and this class is for informational purposes only" or have students sign a waiver of understanding).

Such drool
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:25:33
Okay, so here's how I understand it in kind of an Eli5 way. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
Let's pretend you own account 67390184773891035 and have 2 bitcoins.
So your coins aren't actually stored on your computer: a whole ton of decentralized computers keep tabs on who's got what and they'll agree that "okay, account number 67390184773891035 has 2 bitcoins." But you need a way to verify that that's actually YOUR account and you can spend those bitcoins.
You can do this by keeping your account info and passwords on your computer but then you might enter that into a nefarious website or it could get read by a third party. But if you had an OFFLINE computer keep your info safe, then the ONLINE computer could go, "hey, offline computer, please tell the all the computers that keep track of the world's bitcoin that I own account 67390184773891035 and would like to spend 1 bitcoin." Then the OFFLINE computer says, "yes, I verify that that is your account and you can spend the bitcoins." This is called a digital signature and it means you never have to keep your account password online in any fashion.
The Trezor and Ledger basically function as that offline computer so that you can complete bitcoin transactions but never have to put your "password" online in any form.

I'd probably say it's because of two words: future adoption.
There's a finite amount of bitcoin to be mined and it's harder for people to mine it unless you have cheap electricity and a huge system set up to do it. Couple that with the fact that more and more places are adopting bitcoin as a payment method. When the supply gets scarcer and adoption rises, the item in question gains value. Right now it's gaining because of the perceived value of its use 10-15 years from now, maybe sooner.
Let's say you live on an island with a few hundred people. Everyone uses twigs as currency: you clean my hut for 10 twigs and I'll buy two coconuts for you for 5 twigs. It's a means of not having to barter for everything (you're using twigs instead of directly saying "I'll give you two coconuts to clean my hut"). Problem is, twigs are everywhere and just about anyone can get them. They're not worth much.
But one day you find this rainbow-colored seashell on the beach. Someone says, "I'll give you 5 twigs for that, the effort it took you to find it and bring it to me!" You say, "sure!" Your seashell now has a value of 5 twigs, or 2 coconuts, or 1 hut cleaning.
More people start bringing up seashells from the beach. More twigs are exchanged for them. What everyone doesn't know is that there are only exactly 1,000 rainbow seashells on the entire beach, no more. Soon there's a run on seashells. You used to be able to get a seashell for 5 twigs but since people are noticing that the seashells are scarce and that some other people are hoarding them, it suddenly costs 25 twigs for a seashell! Then soon after 40 twigs! Then 100 twigs! Then 500 twigs. Finally, seashells are costing 2,000 twigs each. But it's not just twigs ... one seashell now equals buckets and buckets of coconuts or many, many hut cleanings.
So basically money exists as a means of transferring the value of goods and services without having to barter. Once something more desirable and more scarce comes into play, that item takes more value until it either gets really expensive or there's a bubble.
But lucky you, after just a single year, one rainbow seashell costs a whopping 5,000 twigs. And in your forethought, you found a cache of a hundred seashells that you now keep safe in a wallet made of paper.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:53:29
Do you know when that's planned?
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:07:18
I wish this would happen. Except for "swish, swish, bish." That song drives me nuts. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:58:34
Here's kind of a loose analogy. Let's say there's a lottery. You have to write a number on a little ticket between one and a hundred trillion in sequential order and you have to make sure with everyone else that you don't duplicate the number on the ticket. Every ten minutes a computer will spit out a different number and whoever has written that on their ticket wins.
The first time it's pretty easy and between you and three other guys. You get up to 50, checking with each other to make sure that you're not writing down duplicate numbers on your tickets. The computer then puts out the number "12" as it's first winner. That's you! You get $10.
More people join the game and also someone figures out that a certain type of pen works better and that guy can do double the numbers everyone else can. The computer calls out "77." You don't win—the guy with the nice pen does.
You win the third time but after that someone is just printing numbers on tickets with a rubber stamp that changes incrementally quickly. Then someone else brings a device that can burn through tickets at a rate of 50 per minute and it's automated. Then someone else brings a device that can do 500 tickets a minute, automated. Then someone else has one that can do 5,000 per minute. Some of those people pool their work together. Others buy warehouses and store huge machines that will print 10,000 tickets per minute.
You're still writing tickets by hand. With a pencil. You no longer win the lottery. Your hand gets sore and you need food and sleep. So instead you give up and play video games.
Unfortunately that's the current state of mining. Most home rigs will just be used for Steam because the big boys have huge rigs in place to mine more efficiently than anyone at home can.
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:44:49
Think of it this way. Write down 24 single-digit numbers between 1 and 9. The chance else would duplicate that is very slim.
This is how long that number stream is (I just mashed the keyboard 24 times):
And now, with commas:
That's about as easy to accidentally have duplicated as a 24-word passphrase. It's nearly impossible.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:37:57
Good explanation, thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:28:11
Good points. And yeah, at this point the best approach seems to be purchasing coins unless you have the ability to setup an industrial-sized mining system.

Well there'll be an inevitable big dip sometime within the next year. Able to figure out when that is? Any big news coming down the pipe that might sway people to sell en masse?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:51:10
Bitcoin hits all time high of $8 million dollars because OP sold. May we always remember his sacrifice.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:41:14
This. Gonna suck when it’s summer and BTC is like $15,000-$18,000.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:37:37
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:38:49
Sounds about right. And then everyone will be complaining about this huge crash when in reality it's 5x what it was right now.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:41:34
Or pulling out because the holidays and fall and such are over and they need the money for other things. There's also no good news right now online or on TV about BTC. Once it starts rising, it's going to rocket, especially if it gets anywhere near the ATH again.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:40:25
Yeah. There's blood in the streets right now and it's glorious. It's like a giant Steam Sale on crypto. Personally, I feel it's a fantastic time to not only get BTC but also ETH and lots of smaller altcoins. Right no people are bitching about the crash but I'm sure come summer or fall people are going to be bitching that people can't get coins this cheap anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:46:59
I could see that, yeah.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:43:26
I think this is an extended FUD problem. Bitcoin dips so people freak the fuck out and sell. Then in a little while (who knows but maybe a few weeks or months) it'll level off and have more gradual ups and downs and then people will start investing again. When it hits $12,000 again, and it will, people will have FOMO rushes and then we'll get a bunch of those "y'all have any more of that $9,000 Bitcoin" memes.
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:54:57
Okay, that's pretty clever!
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:46:59
I could see that, yeah.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:54:04
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:17:47
And then where did it go ... ?
You're not supposed to buy the dip and then spend it.
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:28:30
Still would recommend only from the Ledger site though. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:27:44
Yup. Always buy only from the official site.
Here's what I would do:
- Immediately send this product back.
- Buy a Ledger S from the official site and wait for it to arrive.
- Put your coins in a paper wallet until then.
It would suck huge ass for you to lose thousands in the future for a $95 purchase.
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:13:33
Hold. I've weathered an ETH storm like this last year.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:02:22
Cool. Might have to check it out. Currently into Digital Gold. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:11:03
Is it very technical?
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:53:05
Yup. It'd only weigh eighty five bajillion tons (actual scientific term).
If two people ask for the same brick, the government locks them in Fort Knox and requires them to fight MMA style until one is knocked out. Winner gets the brick. Loser gets the boot.
Also, I heard from a friend of a friend of a friend's grandmother that Bitcoin is unreliable because it uses something called the "black chain" and operates on what's called the "dork web." So stay away from Bitcoin guys!
Also, apparently Bitconnect is pretty legit. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 20:43:24
Thanks. I try never to keep coins on any exchange longer than I have to.
@_date: 2017-07-08 20:41:52

Holy shit. That's totally different than the stock market when there's a split. I absolutely thought it would halve my investment per coin.

That's because I'm not a hardened bitcoiner.
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:42:39
Why not blockchain as the wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:18:52
You will need A. Some US dollars in a bank (well, any currency but I'll explain with USD), B. what's called a bitcoin "wallet" and C. a visit to a bitcoin exchange (sort of like a stock exchange):
Step 1. Go here and set up your bitcoin wallet: 
Read the instructions for how to do an online wallet. A wallet is exactly what it sounds like: it's a way to interact with your bitcoin (it's a bit more complicated than that but that's the basic idea). You'll not only have a login an password with them but you'll also have two other things, a bitcoin address and a your personal passkey, both of which kind of look something like this (a long stream of seemingly random numbers and letters.
Your bitcoin address is fine to give out but your passkey should be kept very safe. Read online articles about how to keep your passkey safe.
Step 2. Go to the Coinbase.com cryptocurrency exchange setup an account with a login and password and link your bank account, credit card, or PayPal account with them. You'll be asked to verify your identity through various methods depending on if you use a bank transfer, credit card, or PayPal.
Step 3. Once verified at Coinbase, deposit some US dollars into the account and use that to purchase bitcoin.
In Coinbase, once you've purchased bitcoin it'll add the bitcoins to a wallet that Coinbase makes for you. It's EXTREMELY UNWISE to leave your bitcoins on Coinbase, which is where step 1 comes back into play.
Step 4. Use the blockchain.jnfo bitcoin address you set up in step 1 and plug that into Coinbase to transfer your bitcoins to your personal wallet. Again, DO NOT LEAVE YOUR BITCOIN ON COINBASE; only use it for buying and selling.
And that's about it. You've now got bitcoin in your personal wallet.
Some more notes:
- Read a book on bitcoin to see what's really going on with your coins.
- Again, never leave your coins on an exchange like Coinbase. You might have heard of MtGox, which was an exchange that went down and lost like half a billion dollars worth of user's bitcoins in 2014 or 2015.
- ALWAYS do test transfers of small amounts of money or bitcoin first as a test. Buy only the minimum bitcoin as a trial (I think it's something like $25 worth ... I don't remember the exact amount) and then make sure the transfer to your personal wallet goes through.
- You are basically your own bank! The more security you have the better.
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:28:35
Is a hardware wallet better than all those options?
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:01:49
Not only that but we might live in a world in the near future where people are using 1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin for simple transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:57:03
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:58:20
Also, how would you lock down a paper wallet, phone, or cheap laptop if you have to have it go online at least a few times to make it work?
