He really is.  I've been watching the wikipedia thing going on but I can't edit the article or the talk page so I tried to figure out why and its because of Atlas.  He is the reason the bitcoin page is fully protected and the bitcoin talk page is semiprotected.  The article was protected because of him using sockpuppets and then he got blocked so he decided [to start vandalising the talk page]( with [sockpuppets]( and [even ran Gmaxwell and Luke-Jr off]( and I really think they would have been a big help with the whole ponzi thing.  He is the reason the pages cannot be edited and why the users that would have *actually helped* weren't around when they were needed.

Oh look another Atlas account trying to stir up shit because the little fucker can't edit wikipedia himself anymore.

This is yet another attempt by Atlas to stir up shit.  For anyone who isn't aware Atlas was blocked from wikipedia for being a sockpuppet (pretending to be multiple people by having many accounts) and being a dumb twat by trying to control the bitcoin page.  Hit "View History" on these pages and you will see Howardstrong (Atlas) all over these pages.  He tried to [add bitcoin as a currency for Finland]( and [knows goddamn well]( what this article is and is not.  I'm all for promoting bitcoin but when you have dumb twats like Atlas making a muck of things it gives bitcoin a bad name and makes bitcoin users look like fanboys, and that's not fair to us, you jackass.
