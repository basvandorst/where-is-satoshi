I made metal card on a waterjet a while ago for use with a punch set like that. Do you think there would be a market for something like this?
@_date: 2016-04-02 18:36:45
Buy coins on every exchange. Never sell ever. Also mine them and never sell. Price will initially go up, and up, and up, but with unlimited funds, eventually, because you've destroyed bitcoins liquidity for everyone but yourself, you have all of them... nothing is less valuable than a currency nobody uses.
@_date: 2016-04-03 19:41:25
The point is to reduce liquidity, not snatch up all the coins. Without the ability to buy and sell, there would be little incentive to use them. If once you used them, you knew you would never have a chance to get any more, that would have a chilling effect on spending. 
Bitcoin usage depends, in part, on the ability of people to get coins. If that is made impossible, then nobody will use them. If nobody uses them, then they become effectively worthless.

So... this may be a dumb question, but If I started mining on the genesis block, in a kind of alternate timeline, and I got others to do so as well, could we kind of start over with a new set of bitcoins that would actually, eventually become the "real bitcoin" because the work would be greater on this new forked chain?
Blocks would happen a lot faster, and the timestamps would have to be spoofed, but mining would be a lot easier for a long time on this new one, and history would be re-writing itself at much more than a day per day...

Man I loved hearing that little mining sound with the popup image of a pickaxe and shovel when you mined something...
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:41:36
Fuck you.

I was going to test it out on there for a while, then I was going to invest more money into it... so, in a way I probably saved money from MtGox going down when it did.. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:18:08
I'm just glad I've got my bot running. It's buying these cheap coins right now without me having to do anything.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:52:23
I'd like to see businesses offering change back in bitcoin. That would increase adoption dramatically, and could be easier for cashiers.
@_date: 2014-10-16 06:17:14
They should have an option to not convert to fiat, and just pass the bitcoin through to an address you can specify. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:33:40
I am planning on doing that eventually. I was looking at the Cryptsy api, and BTC-E. I'd also like to adapt it to trade on forex or other types of exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:44:02
I lost 0.21044073 BTC... I know exactly because I had just finished a new MtGox trading bot that was making trades for me... found out about all this because the bot stopped making trades and I couldn't figure out why.
edit: here's a link if anyone wants a dead bot now... 
@_date: 2014-08-31 16:17:14
I certainly experienced this while testing the bot I wrote... I think it's still susceptible to oscillation under certain circumstances so I'm not even using it... I hope nobody else is.
@_date: 2014-09-22 03:59:50
I just switched, and now I feel rich!
@_date: 2014-09-11 06:20:27
Some day, someone might post an innocent looking string somewhere that when hashed results in all zeros. On that day, what will bitcoin be worth? How long will it be until that day?
@_date: 2016-03-09 05:55:57
I saw the logo, and thought this was something about a company that advertises a bunch here in utah called workfront. I don't actually know what they do, but their logo is confusingly similar.
@_date: 2015-05-08 05:35:32
So here's something I thought of while reading this...
Why would large blocks even matter anyway? So the transaction volume goes up, but the fee per transaction would probably be the same. Since you'll have to store the transactions anyway eventually larger blocks just mean miners can collect more fees, faster.
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:23:01
This is a great point. Every time someone is trying to build something and finds that they can use Bitcoin or the blockchain to solve one of their problems, the whole system gets stronger.
@_date: 2018-10-21 17:09:55
Very refreshing and... WTF...
I'm bearish, but the reasons are to numerous to fit in this narrow margin.
@_date: 2019-03-01 19:39:40
Yeah, I'll go you one better... look up the NEM unclaimed stake issue.
My son and I can't get our coins that were worth $9,000,000 last January...

I'm thinking that what we're looking at here, is rock solid proof that time travel is going to be invented, so that circle can go all the way around....
@_date: 2016-12-24 11:09:19
I've sold lower, and I've bought higher... do what you want.
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:15:18
Lol, this literally got me to buy a little bitcoin. I've been all out since August, but I'm feeling bullish again for some reason.
Buyer Beware, the bottom is likely to fall right out now that I'm in again...
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:45:54
Holy... shit sauce?
@_date: 2019-02-14 10:13:58
It doesn't matter what you will accept... if the miners decide that they want a minimum block reward forever then you'll eat what they feed you.
@_date: 2015-07-16 00:40:22
I've had a similar thought.
I was walking around late at night, and was thinking about money compared to circuits. Flow is like current.
Money is electrons. Banks and other assets are capacitors. Jobs and investments are batteries. Our expenses are resistance. Annuities and insurance are inductors.
This is how money works already, but because payday is every other Friday and rent is due on the 1st our delicate financial circuits are essentially powered by connecting charged capacitors to shorted wires. Then we wonder why people have financial problems.
If we could transition to this method, people could see better how their actions affect their situation... Not that it really matters. We'll be post scarcity before we fix this.
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:53:15
The thought occurs to me that someone is always holding the coins, but it's like hot potato and you don't really want to be holding it when it goes down...
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:05:33
I'm fairly certain the challenges with straddling the usability/security line will burn enough people PERMANENTLY, that the whole crypto space is going to go belly up. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:07:56
They are really cheap.
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:26:30
Well, I buy about $20 worth of bitcoin a week, so maybe there's a couple hundred thousand people out of the 7 billion on earth who do something similar.
@_date: 2018-04-07 05:16:31
There was an anti-spam email list that I was a part of in around 2004 where many of the technologies behind bitcoin were discussed. HashCash, public key encryption, hashing of mesages, public ledgers, trust networks, and out of band communication were all topics that were debated ad nausium.
In my mind it is possible that these people could be satoshi. They were highly technical, diverse in background, prone to secrecy and privacy (though many were very well known), and tended to build things first and explain later.
@_date: 2015-04-09 02:07:23
When automatic block rewards go away, and transaction fees make up a larger portion of the blocks, I wonder if miners will fluctuate their hashrate dynamically based on how much the current block is worth at that time.
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:14:58
Gox me once, shame on you... but you can't Gox me a second time!
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:16:10
This makes me wonder why there is any spread at all... Seems like with no fee, bots would narrow the spread to nothing.
@_date: 2015-02-07 10:49:02
There are some anti laundering laws that prevent ATM owners from dispersing more than, *I think*, $2000 per day to any individual. Some buddies and I are thinking about building some, and we have a choice of either limiting the amount or paying approximately $50k per year to get licensed as a money transmitter.
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:09:26
I've had a few ideas similar to this, but have never built any of them. I call them economic installations. The first one that I came up with was modeled on an idea from riverworld. It would be a machine that would cook some rice, put it in a paper bowl, and send it out on a conveyor every 10 minutes. Another was a wheelbarrow full of pennies to be placed in a mall food court. The minimum wage machine would have a scale that you stand on for a few minutes to have it spit out a $1 bill. Another would just drop a bill of a random denomination from the top of an atrium in a busy mall every 10 minutes. Using paper wallets to do something like this is a great idea. I'm in.
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:06:23
You'd have to break both SHA256 and RIPEMD-160 to drain balances. Also, draining secure accounts, and burn addresses would set off more red flags than just mining... Maybe that's what some of the high balance accounts mined near the beginning of bitcoin are for. They are a canary in a coal mine that represents the insecurity of bitcoin. I can imagine someone near the very beginning, mining a block of fifty, and throwing away the key just to watch it to make sure things are still working the way they should.
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:56:17
You know what also costs about $400k... A gold Brick.
I once held a full gold brick, and I've got to say, the feeling of holding a full solid brick of gold was way better than the feeling of owning a bitcoin.
My advice, if it does hit $400k, is buy a gold brick and use it as a doorstop or something... just for laughs
@_date: 2016-07-10 21:32:00
I've got one for you... Someone figures out how to reverse SHA256 then starts mining blocks for free.
Eventually people will start to gradually discover that the proof of work securing the network is rotten and liquidate their coin before the rest of us figure it out... That will be the true end of Bitcoin because it will be completely worthless...
@_date: 2016-07-10 21:23:18
Yeah, unfortunately lightspeed is your limiting factor there. Bitcoin is great, but it's strictly a single planet currency.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:41:42
I let my bot check the price once a minute, and if it fails me i'll kill -9 it...
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:26:39
and still going... 912

I sold .4 on coinbase on nov 13... still haven't gotten my money. I don't suppose they'll cancel that order for insufficient funds.

It's crazy to see the large sell orders eroded so fast on bitcoinwisdom.com
