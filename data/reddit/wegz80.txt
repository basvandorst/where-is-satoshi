What an awesome read. I actually sent 50$ worth of BTC to his vanity address during the donation storm. Had kinda been waiting to read an update on his thoughts and OP has most certainly delivered here. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:53:35
I really hope a competitor crushes them soon. And that's coming from a long time customer. They just no longer do what is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:19:37
3 of them now, actually!

Gotta start somewhere! Glad to see it in action finally. Tempted to save that chicken, but for 5 bucks... I dunno. Maybe $2.50  :/
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:56:42
Excited about the project but also waiting on the Windows build. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:32:52
Interesting idea. Hope it takes... love Amazon prime. Looking at flat panel mounts on the site right now, lol...

Guy belongs in prison for all the people he scammed out of BTC on pre-orders. He was selling stuff for BTC back when it was 75$ a coin. :(
I feel awful for those people.

So progressive, much like. I live in the next county over and this makes me very happy.

Good job buddy! 
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:20:30
Woot, fuck yah! Just bought a R9 270. The fact that they take bitcoin is what pushed me over the edge to make a purchase. Love supporting companies that adopt the new technology! 
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:49:12
Sounds like a much better use of the communities resources to me. Glad to see the Sub moving in this direction. :)

Power to the people! 
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:20:39
I almost got scammed by this company when I first started GPU mining Bitcoins in early 2013. They belong in prison for the amount of coins they scammed/self mined. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:19:37
I want to help by running a node. Just waiting on the Windows beta. :)
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:59:53
I would throw in a few bucks worth to help the the cause. :)
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:41:36
Butterfly LOLZ. Stay as far away from this company as you can. I almost invested in a Jalapeno way back when... instead I bought about 3 bitcoins off Coinbase. :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:13:43
Thanks for the update! Great PR post! :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:40:17

@_date: 2014-01-18 19:59:08
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:50:06
The fees seem high. Coinbase doesn't charge me nearly that much... 1% + a $.15 wire fee. Still waiting for my Circle invite. :(
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:37:30
I just bought a screwdriver lol... 
@_date: 2017-02-11 14:58:18
Absolutely! Give it a shot with a small purchase just to test the waters. Who doesn't like the added purchasing power of 20 to 30% on your dollar! :D

Download Bitcoin core and help signal for segwit :)
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:58:32
A guy comes in here trying to run a full node which will help Segwit and people are mostly dicks to him... cmon guys. 
OP, it's likely the speed of your computer. Is there maybe stuff running the background that's eating up the processing power of the machine? Maybe try rebooting it and making sure it's fully updated as well. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:44:37
If you can find it on Amazon you can pay with BTC using Purse.io ... get a nice 20% discount too and it's an escrow. I've done 54 transactions with them saving over $1100 so far. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:58:15
Oh darn, well it may be some day, they are always expanding.
OP You are da real MVP though.
I run a full node as well on a traditional computer. Core 13.2 with segwit signalling. :)
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:36:32
We need a core advocate speaker. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:49:22
Hopefully it's Andreas :D
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:19:27
I think it was already converted and dumped onto the exchanges causing the dip to $480 earlier today.
Just wild speculation on my part though.

Coinbase is the easiest but they have high fees. Exchange like Gemini if you are in the US. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 21:29:36
It just take a long time for the initial sync, its the CPU holding you back. Just leave the machine on and let it run. Once it synced you wont even notice it's there other then some bandwidth usage. Thanks for doing your part to help the network OP. :)

@_date: 2017-03-29 13:44:24
It would be nice if someone would build a miner and full node that cost a few hundred bucks and was plug and play.

I wasn't impressed with the QOS on my router. Would rather just control the application directly and leave the router alone. It's the only app I use that just gobbles every bit of bandwidth available.

Cool, so how long before alot of Wall St starts playing around on the Coinbase exchange? :D

You can play with the maxconnections flag as well to limit bandwidth consumption. I'm on a 30Mb/5 line and set mine to 16 active connections.
