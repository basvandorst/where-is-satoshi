Maybe, but even if the malware can't feasibly dump the flash, it could get the device to sign malicious transactions (emptying the user's bitcoin account, or redirecting payments to attacker-controlled addresses) using the same mechanism as any legitimate Bitcoin software on the computer.

Problem with BIP0070 is that PKI is optional, so the PaymentRequest messages are still subject to interference by stripping signatures out.

"Very unlikely" doesn't cut it when you have a device that could be protecting tens or hundreds of thousands of $$$. It needs to be impossible to extract the private keys via software, and incredibly difficult and expensive to do so via hardware hacking (e.g. like certain high-security smartcards).

It's a bad idea because there is no protection from malware attacking it over the USB. You might as well store your private keys unencrypted on your PC.
**Edit:** and by malware attacks, I mean dumping of flash memory to extract private keys, or getting the device to sign a transaction that steals all your Bitcoins. It could also upload a malware component to the mp3 player using the very same mechanism being used to reflash the device for this custom firmware, in order to help with these attacks.

Okay so this means that to reliably prevent malware MITMing legitimate transactions, the following conditions must be met:
1. all transactions must be with merchants implementing BIP0070
2. all merchants must use PKI and sign their PaymentRequest messages at all times
otherwise it's going to end up like web browser security warnings, where users just click through without really thinking about the risk.
I don't think that this is feasible, not yet.

The odds are so hugely against you guessing it that it is essentially impossible.

Even if that can be solved, there is still the problem of malware presenting malicious transactions to be signed.

If this takes off then the next generation of malware will just dump its flash over USB and steal the private keys. 
Not a good idea.
