It should wash out. Transaction fees are driven by market forces now and will still be in the future - the more one pays per amount of transaction data, the quicker the transaction will be included in a block. This is not only because existing miners are more likely to make higher fee density blocks, but because higher fees will draw more miners.  When mining rewards diminish to nothing, fees likely will need to compensate, but this will be gradual and holders of bitcoin won’t be experiencing inflation any longer.

Dollar cost average, but at a lower or higher rate depending on what color the price is on a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, like this one: [
Call it a "weighted dollar cost average."

Isn't the price of BTC in USD a useful proxy for understanding the buying power of BTC? Granted it would be better if we understood the buying power of BTC directly, but it's changing so rapidly and it's new compared to USD, so it's much easier to understand what a BTC can buy by translating to USD. Also granted that the buying power of USD erodes with inflation.

I don’t mean to be mean, but I think you’ll get the mean price, not the median.

That’s like saying the moon doesn’t orbit the earth, the earth orbits the moon, when in reality they both orbit the center of mass. The analogy for the center of mass is purchasing power.
