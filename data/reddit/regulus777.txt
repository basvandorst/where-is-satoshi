I'd like to see Nxt briefly discussed as the transparent forging + 1 minute block intervals could mean a very high transaction rate limit that operates in a very efficient manner... Perhaps it would be best to avoid too much alt coin talk though as it might further confuse the general public.

It's truly amazing how fast the donations are pouring in! I love you guys!

Over 21 BTC now. This means that over a millionth of all bitcoins that will ever exist have been donated to Dorian Nakamoto at this point!

It's wonderful that we have this "Unsystem" group that really takes privacy seriously. I'm glad there are developers that are not allowing themselves to become complacent. As a voluntarian / anarchist, the most attractive qualities of Bitcoin to me are those that allow us to take back our economic freedom from the violent gangs we call governments.

The Libertarian Party hasn't been libertarian for years, unfortunately. Bob Barr, Gary Johnson, Bill Weld...

And if we reach a point where blocks are saturated and I can rarely make a transaction, how can I possibly control my own funds?

I was really excited about this product, but with a price tag of $320 Canadian, I'm going to have to pass... at least for quite awhile.

Any plans to support Ether as well?

That's a story? That's standard operating procedure...

I recommend, if a paper wallet sounds like too much work, to make sure you encrypt your wallet with a long password and then back up your wallet.dat file on 2 different USB flash drives that you keep in different locations.

I thought it was very easy to make out what you're saying... I think some people are watching this with earplugs or something.

The private key says "PEE cow" near the end. I just thought you guys should know...

I'm a professional web developer and diehard libertarian / voluntarian / anarcho-capitalist, so I caught wind of this in 2011 and was immediately interested. The more reading I did, the more Bitcoin excited me. Here I am in 2013, far more focused on Bitcoin than ever. I believe this is the technology that could help disrupt and bring down the international banking cartel, built on top of a fractional-reserve banking system that is essentially fraudulent.

Good job Ed, Ethan, Erik, and Peter. I really enjoyed the discussions.

Anarchy doesn't mean "no rules", it means "no rulers"... so yes, Bitcoin is anarchistic.

That's not the first interview since he got the letter. He was interviewed on The Alex Jones Show about 20 minutes after he received it.
