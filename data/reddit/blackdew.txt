Spending unconfirmed outputs is perfectly OK, that's not your problem and your transaction isn't in limbo.
Both transactions are currently stuck mempools because the network is saturated, and their fees are relatively low (26 and 42 sat/byte). Once the mempools clear up they should both confirm. You can see the current distribution of fees and confirmation time predictions here - 
If you don't want waiting, you could try RBF (replace by fee - re-sending the second transaction with a higher fee) but it'll likely not work since it's not flagged as replaceable. 
If you control the output of the second transaction you could also try CPFP (child pays for parent) - make a third transaction with a significantly higher fee, which will incentivise miners to mine the first 2 transactions so that they can claim it.
Segwit isn't going to directly affect any of the above, except reducing overall network congestion. Maybe.

It is a very interesting piece of tech with a lot of potential.
For example instead of storing coins on an exchange you could just have a LN channel(s) open with it. Since transactions are instant you could do a transaction for every trade order you issue in real time yet retain control of your funds and be sure that you can recover them if/when the exchange goes MtGox or BTC-E.

Not really, they are divisible up to 8 decimal places right now. Anything more will almost certainly require a hardfork.

Not entirely, because you retain (limited) control over the money, and if the other side becomes unresponsive or uncooperative (= tries to scam you) - you can recover your unspent money after a delay, unlike a gift card.

A medium-sized miner could in theory fabricate a chain that looks like such a loss of hashpower occurred, then mine a bunch of blocks on it making it longer than the "real" chain and cause a huge reorg.
Effectively you are allowing a 51% attack without having &gt;=51% hashpower.

Err are segwit2x nodes (i guess btc1? or are there any other implementations right now?) activating those bits now? I thought it would only happen when they actually fork...
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:36:30
Well at the current state them doing it the wrong way is just hurting them.
The aim of this change is not to hurt them, it's to prevent the mess that happened with BCH fork, where forked nodes would end up connected to a bunch of peers that they couldn't really talk to and isolated from "their" network until they either lucked out or the operator deleted the peers file and restarted.
Personally i think a better solution would be tying the magic number to active consensus rules (so it changes on a hardfork), and possibly implementing some kind of a system where nodes would keep a small list of other nodes with different magic numbers they know about, so they could tell stray nodes from the other network where their friends are :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:02:51
It'll start adjusting 6 blocks after the fork... which at the current rate might be in a week or three.

Assuming you still have access to the private keys - you can just re-create or re-sign the transaction on a BCH client.
If for some reason you don't... you could, in theory, convince a miner to mine that transaction into a BCH block (if such a thing ever materializes) as-is... it's valid, but considered non-standard so normally nodes won't relay it and miners won't include it.

It's mostly a problem for systems that create transactions that spend outputs from other unconfirmed transactions. If the ID of the first TX changes - the second TX becomes invalid and will never confirm. It's a significant problem for various off-chain solutions (like lightning network).
The other case is badly written software that tracks outgoing transactions by their ID, which is not the right way and no one should be doing that.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:28:00


Because there is no more signalling or not signalling for segwit, bit 1 is now meaningless, so miners can turn it off.
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:20:11


As we've seen with BTC1, miners can and will collude to run non-standard software if (they think) it's in their best interest.
Ultimately what happens when the mining majority and the economic majority disagrees on the rules that should be enforced is what's under question here.
And since the economic majority will likely never agree to rules under which SW transactions can be stolen and the mining majority will not be able to redeem their mining profits without such agreement... it will never happen.

It's well withing margins of statistic error. Remember that block mining is random and depending on luck you can have 2 blocks a second apart... or a hour-long lull.

The services field isn't the right place to signal intent.
Honestly, it isn't the right place to signal forking either, and it would be better if BCH and S2X nodes just changed their magic numbers at the moment a fork happens. But alas...
For signalling intent they can use the useragent just like UASF did.

The best miners (available to the general public) nowadays do about 0.1W/Gh, so with 20GW of power they could get 2 ExaHash/s which is ~~3 orders of magnitude more than the current total hashpower...~~
~~I'm pretty sure that would never be financially viable, just the mining hardware to run that would cost well into the billions not to mention all the infrastructure and maintenance. Now for the first 2 weeks they would be raking in tons of cash, basically able to mine 1-2 blocks per second, but then difficulty adjustment would kick in and kill it. And the market would probably crash once people figure out what's going on.~~
All of the above is wrong because i somehow messed up my decimal places. They would get 2 ExaHash/s which is ~1/3 of the current mining rate of the whole network.

Outputs can be spent before the transaction is included in a block, this is normal.
Miners will usually grab both and put them together in blocks, but if the first transaction becomes invalid for whatever reason that will also invalidate all transactions spending it's outputs and none of the chain will confirm.

@_date: 2017-08-09 14:04:27
I can't say how stores actually do it, but if i was running one...
Run a local full node with a good number of peers (say 200+), transaction gets verified that it's valid (e.g. that the coin it spends actually exist and weren't spent before), then send it to a few peers and wait for a large number of other peers to try to send it back to you - meaning it flooded through the network and was accepted by most nodes as valid and didn't conflict with anything else in the mempool.
All of the above should take 10-20 seconds tops, and you can be somewhat sure the transaction will get into a block eventually. 
Yes there's still some risk of fraud, but for small purchases it isn't high and it's no different than accepting credit cards or fiat. You figure out the risk and integrate it into your price structure.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:47:57
It's going up because there's fuck all supply on exchanges. Most exchanges either don't let deposit or if you find one that does you are stuck in the mempool for 10 hours. There's over 90k BCH in the mempool right now!
So supply is nonexistent and demand pushes the prices up. It's nice for those that got in time, but won't hold as availability increases.

This is not a real problem, or at least it's a problem that will fix itself.
Once there are lots of segwit transactions there will be economic pressure on the miners to generate blocks into which they can include them.
This isn't even specific to SW, even with "vanilla" transactions a miner can choose to include or not any of them as he wishes... or none at all. But including the highest fee/byte ones is profitable so they do it. Same thing will happen here.

Nodes don't care how a transaction ended up in a block. When a node receives a new block it goes over all the transactions in it, validates them, and if the block is valid removes anything from it's own mempool that's either in the block, or conflicts with it.

Is it the address you generated? 
If it is and your wallet doesn't show the transaction then there is something wrong with your wallet software. What did you use?

@_date: 2017-08-07 14:13:11
That's how bitcoin works. It is a pretty common gotcha when you think in terms of "coins" or "wallets".
If you funded the paperwallet with 1 transaction sometimes in the past, then there is 1 unspent transaction output (txout) that can be spent by that key.
When you move any amount of coin from it, the system has to spend this 1 output completely, thus the "change" from the money you spent ends up on a new address generated by your wallet behind the scenes.
Now if originally you had multiple transactions going out to that paperwallet - some of them might still be unspent. That's why it's a good idea to check the addresses section in electrum and see where your money really is.
In any case, since you used the wallet on a device (that might potentially be compromised), it's a good idea to make a new one, and transfer everything left over to it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:52:04

The main algorithms uses in bitcoin is [SHA256]( and [RIPEMD160]( for hashes plus [ECDSA]( over [secp256k1]( curve for signing.
Your private key is just a random 256 bit integer between 1 and **n**. Your public key is the result of multiplying your private key by **G** over the curve. **n** and **G** are constant parameters you can see their value in the link above.
An address for normal (P2PKH) transactions is RIPEMD160(SHA256(publickey)), where publickey is a DER encoding of the X coordinate of the public key. For user-visible presentation this is further encoded with [Base58Check](

But that's true for any freely-traded currency. You probably don't notice it that much, since you do most of your transactions in USD, but that TV was probably not made in USA, more likely China or Japan or maybe Korea. The exchange rates between USD and JPY/CNY/KRW would affect that companies (or their suppliers') profits just as much as BTC/USD exchange rate.
Also holding other currency as a form of investment, or protection from inflation isn't something uncommon. In many countries with less stable economies buying USD or EUR is a very common form of investment.

Well you are getting UASF regardless, as long as you keep running/connecting to an UASF node.
The latest BIP91 can lock in and guarantee no UASF chain split is July 28th, which is 4 activation periods after the current one.
If BIP 91 activates before Aug 1st - then technically everyone gets UASF, since miners will enforce the exact same consensus rule.
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:23:16
Current UASF nodes will accept SegWit2x blocks up until the 2x HF happens (3 months after the activation of Segwit), at which point they won't.
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:33:25
Segwit2x doesn't care about nodes, it cares about miners.
If my understanding is correct, and if &gt;80% hashrate is running segwit2x by 21/7 (which is what their "agreement" is about)... BIP91 activates on 25/7, supermajority of miners rejects all blocks not signaling segwit, and everyone's nodes (core/uasf/btc1) happily stay on the same chain ever after... or at least until the 2mb hardfork.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:43:43
BCC has a [method]( to create transactions that aren't valid on core-chain.
If you do your transaction with a client/wallet that correctly implements it, that transaction will be only valid on BCC chain and your BTC will be safe.

The 2 above are pretty much what you'll see nowadays.
XT used to signal lowest 3 bits (0x20000007), unlimited did the same but with major version 4 (so 0x40000007).
I don't know if ABC does anything special with the version bits? Anyone knows?
Added: [This page]( has a list of "officially" assigned bits, but it's only stuff covered by core, so doesn't include segwit2x.

Yes, but by default (unless they modify their software) they won't.
That's why i said "So bob will have to mine it himself, or at least find a miner willing to accept it."
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:48:10
BIP 91 needs 80% support over 336 blocks to activate. Once that happens miners start to reject blocks that don't signal segwit, and since they have 80% hashpower everyone follows them, including UASF. 
Actual segwit needs 2016 blocks to lock in... depending on how exactly BIP91 activation lines up with those periods, we'll likely see it activate mid to late Aug.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:47:15
One of the ideas/benefits of segwit is to make removing entries from the UTXO set cheaper than adding to it. 
It won't affect the entries already in UTXO, but it will hopefully slow down it's growth and reduce "dust" build up.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:39:40
Oops, i meant July. Fixed.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:41:39
This is also wrong.
BIP 91 itself uses a different bit for signalling, but once that bit activates (80% of 336 blocks signalling support), all the miners will start rejecting blocks that don't signal "normal" (BIP-141) segwit.
The miners that run BTC1 are also signalling the normal segwit bit, and their implementation is compatible with core.
If BIP91 activates before Aug 1st both core and UASF nodes will follow it's chain and no split will happen (at least until the 2x HF later).
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:06:24

@_date: 2017-07-17 11:33:55
Pretty moot anyway. The current segwit activation period doesn't have enough blocks to lock in even if everyone starts signalling now. Next one will start on ~24th ~~Aug~~ July and there's a good chance BIP91 will be locked in by then.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:09:01
You read a lot of conflicting statements because it's a bloody mess (from BCC devs).
Up until like a week ago (version 0.14.5 of bitcoin ABC) replay protection was opt-in, which effectively meant NO replay protection for transactions on core-chain.
Since then they made transactions generated by core "non-standard", which means nodes running versions after this change will reject them... But miners can still include them in mined blocks, since they are "valid". Also it's unclear how many nodes will still be running the old version tomorrow.
Ultimately it doesn't matter. The method outlined [here]( doesn't rely on replay protection to keep your coin safe. 
Worst case scenario is that on step 4 you discover that your transaction from step 3 was replayed on BCC chain, which means your split failed and you start over again (using your new seed).
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:25:13


Or even easier, move your pre-split coins to a new address on BCC-side using their versioned sighash system. 
That transaction will not be valid on core-side, and from that point all the money you moved will be safe from replays both ways.
Edit: luke-jr's methods were meant for a potential UASF chain split, which doesn't have any builtin replay protection on either side, so it's much more complicated that needed here.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:54:17
Once BIP91 is active miners will start rejecting blocks that don't signal for segwit, so unless they want to reject their own blocks - it's very unlikely they won't be signalling.
Also the 2x HF is hardcoded to deploy only after segwit is active.
And make no mistake, they don't want segwit. But they want a chainsplit with UASF even less, that's why NYA and BIP91 exist to begin with.
Added: There isn't a whole lot of time left for stalling, either segwit activates with BIP91 or with UAHF. We will see what happens in less than a week.
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:02:25
Officially everyone is supposed to start signalling on the 21st.
It's quite possible they still haven't finishing rolling out BTC1 or had to revert temporarily due to some issue maybe.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:59:59
But having everyone else follow that definition would require consensus... by definition.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:51:30
Say you have a wallet with 3 unspent outputs, a 0.25 btc one, 0.5 btc and a 1 btc. And you want to send 0.75 btc.
Under current rules, inputs are generally bigger than outputs (since you need to include a signature and a public key in an input, compared to just a hash for the output) so your client will prefer to split the 1 btc to send 0.75 + change of 0.25 because it's cheaper. As a result you added an entry to the UTXO.
With segwit, most of the stuff in inputs goes into the witness data and they become significantly smaller, while the outputs stay mostly the same size (they just replace the current pubkey/script hash with a witness script hash). So under segwit rules your client will prefer to combine your 0.25 + 0.5 btc to send those 0.75 - removing an entry from the UTXO set.
The example is kinda trivial, but think how it scales out to big merchants and exchanges who often manage tens of thousands of unspent outputs and it can make a significant difference.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:50:59


That's a consensus rule :)

Yes, you will get this message as long as bit 4 is being signalled by BIP-91 miners, or as long as core/uasf don't recognize it.

**Possibility 2 – we will avoid the blockchain split** - this section is completely bogus!


Nope... any miner not signalling bit 1 at the moment is wasting all it's electricity to mine blocks that will be orphaned.
In fact it doesn't even matter. Even if magically segwit disappeared this very instance, BCC activation is completely unrelated and would still go as planned.

@_date: 2017-07-31 18:20:22
There is no "snapshot". It's just the normal UTXO database.
The split happens when the transactions on each side diverge, which happens once the first block of the side chain is mined.
Though i'd personally wait a few more blocks after that to see that no stupid shit is happening (bugs, reorgs, etc.)
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:03:56


No just signalling for segwit wouldn't be greater since without BIP91 activating in time - there will very likely be a chain split come Aug 1.

Assuming they were valid to begin with (and the tamper-proof stuff is still there) they are just as valid right now.
If you care about BCC (and it's not DOA), they will also be valid on BCC chain too and if you want to sell your BCC you'd have to redeem them at that point. Be sure to look up and follow whatever instructions that will be available for replay-protection at that point.

That transaction will likely be considered "non-standard" by ABC, just like core would consider a segwit transaction if you tried to send one now on the main chain.
This means normal nodes will not relay it and miners will likely not accept it. So bob will have to mine it himself, or at least find a miner willing to accept it.

Yes of course. But unless they all collective agreed on "lets signal for the lulz but not actually implement anything" - at least some of them will be running the actual implementation and start orphaning those blocks, which will lead to temporary splits and reorgs and a bunch of chaos that i doubt they are interested in.
And again, this whole discussion is pretty moot. Whatever happens will happen in the next few days, and neither of us really knows what's going on in miner's heads, so guessing is pointless right now.

That's what i said lol

Probably late this year or early 2018. I don't think any official date has been set yet. 
And who knows about the odds. I don't think there's a whole lot of people very opposed to a 2mb increase (with segwit activated). But there's a lot of politicking and egoes thrown around here, so who knows.

You can tell by looking at the Version field, for this block it's 0x20000012
* The first 2 isn't interesting
* The 1 in the next to last position is for BIP 91 (bit 4)
* The 2 in the last position is for segwit (bit 1)

If someone wants to throw away 45 billion dollars for shit and giggles (likely even more, since the price will go through the moon) he's very welcome to do so. I'll definitely enjoy my cut :P

If BIP91 activates this is irrelevant, as any block not signalling segwit will just be ignored by supermajority of the miners. 
If BIP91 doesn't activate then UASF will cause a chain split. Even a single non-segwit-signalling block on or after Aug 1st can cause UASF and Core to diverge.


There is a good indication that it will. We currently don't see BIP91 signalling since it's not "officially" active until 21st, but other metadata suggests ~87% miners support it. We'll see in the coming days.


Segwit on it's own (BIP141) needs 95% to activate, so that won't change anything.


(This is in a scenario where BIP91 didn't activate in time)
After Aug 1st, once any miner mines a block that doesn't signal segwit support, UASF nodes will reject that block while core nodes will accept it and mine on top of it. At that point the chain will diverge and we have a split.
The only way to eliminate the split at that point will be for the majority of the miners to switch to UASF which will cause UASF-side of the chain to become longer than core and wipe out the core-side.

That's why it's a problem to begin with.
If that technology was open we would just call it an optimization and integrate it into everything and everyone gets +X% hashrate for free. Network is more secure (kinda, maybe), everyone wins (or at the very least doesn't lose anything).
But since it's patented it gives a distinct marked advantage to that miner (either from direct mining profits or licensing fees to other manufacturers). That's why people want to remove that ability.
