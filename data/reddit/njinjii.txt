Rofl thats probably the sadest thing i've seen in a whole. 
Props to the interviewer tho.

Even tho as a general rule its correct to say you are always better of having your bitcoin on a private wallet, at 30$ I would honestly tell you to keep ur bitcoin on the exchange. If you ever want to transfer your coins again, youre going to pay a fee of like 5$. In my opinion the risk of Coinbase losing your coins is so small, its not worth it to get ur coins into a private wallet.

Looks to good to be true tbh. Not saying it wont work, just feels to me like its not going to be as fast and cheap when used by everyone. Lets hope i am wrong.

Yeaaaah lets not get ahead of ourselves. I wouldnt bother transfering it under less than 500-600$ at least. But thats just me. Keep in mind that having ur coins on an exchange actually is pretty safe since you cant lose your private keys.

You must be joking. Every country in the worlds is ahead of us in digitization . Our politicians are busy helping refugees and shit talking each other

While I agree that someone who uses BTC would probably be fine with that, I think that isnt the route you and store owners in general should take. If Bitcoin wants to become a serious payment method in the every day life then paying upfront is not an option in my opinion.

The title definitely makes it sound like you would have to move to Vienna.

To this day I still don't know what we need the 2X part for.

Title is definitely false. He wants to sell his B2X coins for BCash, however, Bitcoin.com will list B2X as Bitcoin. Therefore he definitely supports it, which is obvious, since he supports everything that harms Bitcoin and helps BCash.

Who has the missing 6.8% hashrate?

Im not an expert but as far as im aware Bitmain will only support Bitcoin Cash/BitcoinABC if the New York Agreement fails, which would be the case, again as far as im aware, if within the next 2 or 3 weeks less than a certain number of blocks (not sure the %, i think 80% again?) will be mined by Segwit-Miners, since those blocks would get rejected.
Edit: I think the best way to describe Bitcoin Cash is its basically the UASF (its actually a hard fork) from the "Big Block People" in case Segwit2x doesnt suceed. So basically both sites (Segwit and BigBlocks) now have their own kind of UASF (BIP148 for Segwit, Bitcoin Cash for BigBlocks) to put pressure on miners.

Please dont yell at me but... Is OP beeing ironic?
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:39:38
As someone who pretty much doesnt understand anything about Segwit/BIP18/Segwit2x and so on, how come weve been seeing alot of talk about Segwit2x beeing signaled, yet, according to this, no developer supports it?
