I'm an IT guy with a fairly broad knowledge on various subjects. I do a bit of coding as a hobby and I've been mulling over trying to integrate some of my ideas with bitcoin. Not necessarily as a payment method  but rather utilising bitcoin technology, like it's encryption. What would be a good area to start researching information to get a deeper knowledge of the inner workings of bitcoin. IE: like programming languages for example.

It's been tried already. I work in IT and one day a user comes to me saying they can't log on to their PC cause their computer says they have too many secrets.
Like you, I laugh to myself thinking what crack has this one been smoking? But, I learned a long time ago to just go with whatever a user is saying. Sometimes computers get weird.
So I get there and the error is. "The maximum number of secrets that may be stored in a single system has been exceeded."
A lot of the research I did on this points to a rootkit virus however I have a different theory. This user had a lot of encrypted files and her system was well protected. I didn't find any rootkits, which breaking rootkit viruses was something I was known to be good at. So I found a patch from Microsoft that changed a self imposed restriction of keeping a maximum amount of encrypted files.
Someone in government already had a law/rule built to limit how many files a civilian could encrypt... however a patch removes it. I think the reason some rootkit viruses were generating that error is that they encrypt files to hide themselves, sometimes in infinite loops.
There's been similar rules/laws in the past. Like when 56k modems were being released and they were limited to 33.6k through software limitations.

Nice work dude. I don't see the question asked but how much did this cost in terms of fiat currency? Just curious, I'm sure the total product is worth more.

A long time  ago i worked as a clerk at toys r us and we had a strict rule about the signature having to match. I once refused a card because some dude named william signed his card as bill. (It was signed william on the card.)
That's the day i learned bill is short for william...

Yeah I was in one of those. I got t-boned on the passenger side and wasn't wearing a belt. I fell over onto the passenger seat and had no injuries. When the police showed up they asked if I needed an ambulance cause those kinds of accidents usually results in death due to a snapped neck and survivors usually get bad whiplash.

I have. Two in fact. They were terrorizing my cats, my ex had left the back door open and I came home to some uninvited guests. If you're aggressive enough they won't fuck with you and will bee line straight to the door. One tried to stand his ground but a swift boot to the face followed by some stick swinging got his move on. It took me less than 2 minutes to evict them, I suspect they were grateful to be out of the house in one piece.

The whole "they can print money out of thin air " argument seems a bit overused and under-explained.

You're completely missing my point. Try reading it again and pay attention this time so you don't have to repeat yourself because I'm not going to.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:49:03
You're stating there's laws against a foreign citizen from disseminating classified information but there isn't to my knowledge. I've explained why in my previous comments.
Someone else pointed out that assange may have helped hack hashes on behalf of Manning who provided those hashes and THAT would definitely be something the US could charge him with even if he wasn't a US citizen. However that's different from obtaining leaked info and sharing that info which is what we were discussing. The latter of which I don't believe the US can come after you for. You're assasination plot analogy is not at all the same thing.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:13:05
What laws are there that state a non citizen can't share classified information? Your point is that he's subject to those laws but you're neither providing the laws in question nor how he's responsible for protecting that information and I don't think he has that responsibility.
I work for a government and I have high level security clearance. I had to sign off on that stuff and be given a background check before getting clearance. I can't see how some dude in Australia would be subject to things I agreed to if I were to pass on information I shouldn't be. It would be my responsibility.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:59:46
That's actually not a good comparison unless you can prove he orchestrated the theft of data by manning. Manning stole the data and passed it on to Assange who then curated and distributed the data. I'm not sure how laws revolving around classified information affect non citizens of that country. After all, if you read the leaked info doesn't that make you as culpable as Assange?
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:41:31
Ah well that would definitely be a crime then and yeah he'd be responsible for that.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:05:12
Yes it is, for a US citizen, which he isn't. Where I'm from, smoking marijuana is legal. It's illegal in the US. Should the US be allowed to come charge me for smoking weed in my home country?
It is illegal for a foreign national to crack passwords though which is what he's being charged with, not the dissemination of the classified information.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:01:21
Hacking? I thought Manning just used his access to obtain the info. There's no hacking involved there.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:29:42

Is it possible that perhaps because of their culture and general upbringing that the jewish tend to gravitate towards financially well paying jobs? What you're saying could be equated with stuff like "why is it kenyans keep winning long distance races? " or "why are black people so good at jumping high?" Etc...
You have a specific ethnicity with a talent or penchant towards a task that a large majority around them practice because duh, that's how ethnicity works.
So you're not wrong, you just come off as sounding like you're barking up the wrong tree.

I'd have to see the credentials of each person that had a particular position. What made them good for the job and compare with other applicants to tell if it's intentional or normal.
The fact is if you have 8 out of 10 applicants jewish this is perfectly normal. But to use a statistic like that to make a point as fact is erroneous I think.

I'm an IT guy. One time i was asked to troubleshoot a problem pc. When I get there all i see is an error on the screen saying this pc has too many secrets. At first I thought it was a virus but the more I looked into it I discovered that it's apparently a us government imposed regulation on Microsoft to limit the amount of encrypted files on a single pc. I wish I was making this up.

Also Microsoft released a patch addressing this limit In later versions of xp. So it wasn't some weirdly worded error, they were aware of it and patched it out when it started causing problems.

3 years ago when I wanted to attempt to mine bitcoins i was unable to do so thanks to my shitty connection and the 6gb blockchain.... making things a bit more compact in terms of data isn't a bad idea....
@_date: 2015-03-28 15:48:53
Microsoft dumbed down what used to be written because years ago when I was researching this problem I came to the conclusion that a rootkit virus was encrypting data on this users machine in an attempt to hide itself and eventually hit an OS imposed limit. I gathered this from Microsoft articles posted on TechNet.  This is all that's there now.
I did find some other forum posters talking about it too.
I'm not a conspiracy guy but it's weird that I can't find any TechNet articles on it. I know it existed.

So I have a fairly old pc at home. It's got a half decent video card. I tried to mine coins back when they were worth 0.01 cents but due to shitty Internet I couldn’t download the 6 gig file I needed.
