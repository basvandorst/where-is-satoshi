There will be no gimmicks, and no agents. This is all about bitcoin and rewarding bitcoin to people who are involved in the bitcoin community as well as introducing it to others who don't understand it or think it's only for "underground" uses. But would love to hear your ideas of what you'd like to see. (oh yeah, I created and Produce the show)

Yeah still building the web site. The games will be similar to old style 1970s game show. The point is to have fun with the audience. Not centered at all around the celebs- it's the audience I care about. Celebs were included just to have someone for the host to play with. We are thinking more like fun comedians like a Paul F Tompkins type as well as "celebs" in the Bitcoin community. A-list type movie actors bore me to tears to be honest. The game itself, think Price is Right meets Match Game meets Let's Make a Deal. Some trivia Based, some Tweeting games like  but always want to hear what people think will be good games. The end result is to have a good time, give away bitcoins and exactly as you said, "broaden the audience"

So yeah to be safe- sending out 1099s. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:01:48
Coinbase basically washed their hands of it- they gave me this e-mail response: 
" I can’t speak to PayPal’s 1099 filing practices. I think there is some confusion regarding whether Coinbase is a Third Party Network, for purposes of 1099 reporting. Coinbase does not have any participating payees for which it is contractually obligated to make payments to. In your case, Coinbase was not contractually obligated to make payments to your employees like a payroll services company would be.
I hope this is clearer
Coinbase Compliance"

Really? Got that from Intuit - that you don't file 1099 if you pay thru PayPal
@_date: 2015-01-16 07:30:20
Right but if I paid all crew in Coinbase- then Coinbase is responsible for their received payments? Not me? And we paid all winners using Blockchain- is that the same thing as PayPal?
