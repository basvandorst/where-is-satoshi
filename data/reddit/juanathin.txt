Welcome to capitalism. Where the more money you have means the more money you make and everyone else is fucked.

That was mostly tongue and cheek, I just have a problem with wealth disparity in the US and think the proposed tax cuts will do little, if anything, to alleviate the issue. I just meant the capitalism comment in the sense that I think a purely capitalistic view point for every facet of our lives (in regards to Health Care, Mental Health Care, prison, war, etc.) is digging is deeper into that hole.

Verify through Coinbase! You can fill out the exact same information on coinbase and it won't give you the error.

If you have your pin and access to the hardware wallet the best thing to do would be to access the wallet and move all your funds to a new temporary wallet. Then wipe the Ledger, generate a new seed, and move your funds back to the hardware wallet.
If you keep your BTC on a wallet that you don't have the seed phrase to, you run the risk of losing all your BTC should the wallet be broken, lost, or stolen. There is no way to recover BTC from a hardware wallet without that pass phrase.
I know there are tools that allow you to extract your private key but I don't think there's a way to do so natively using Ledger software. You'd have to use a third party program.

I got the same exact message (which is also 95% accurate for me) but verifying through Coinbase still worked.
Just wait the 24 hours, logon to Coinbase, and verify through them. I think you have to go to Settings &gt; My Profile to enter you name and address. Then go to Settings &gt; Limits and it will ask you to verify your identity to increase limits. This will be the exact same verification process ass GDAX. Once its complete you should be good to get onto GDAX. 
Furthermore if your address is Lane use Ln, if its Street use St, etc. Its kinda fucky.

If it's profitable for miners to jump to other coins they will, but the huge decrease in Bitcoin miners will simultaneously decrease the difficulty of mining BTC which mean rewards for mining will be higher.

All transfers (of both BTC and USD) between Coinbase and GDAX are completely free. Commission fees are much lower. If you just buy at market value you pay higher fees but if you buy using a "limit order" you are pay maker fees which are 0% for everything under $20000 I believe. And yes you would use the exact same credentials for Coinbase to login to GDAX

This is just embarassing.....it took me 10 minutes to read through this comment thread between you two. I don't know whats worse, that I spent the time reading it or you've spent the time writing it lol.

Guess I'm just the exception since I'm a millennial who bought Bitcoin with the sole intention to hold until 2025 (minimum) regardless of price. AMA

Kind of a hassle and not that convenient but it's considered the absolute safest way to store your Bitcoin. 
I'd recommend you get a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S or Trezor. Hardware wallets are much more secure than keeping your coins on an exchange (technically you don't even own the coins when they're stored on an exchange) or on your PC/Mobile as both are susceptible to cyber-attacks.
Plus a hardware wallet allows you store a multitude of alt-coins.

Go under your profile settings on Coinbase and verify there rather than trying to verify through Gdax. Also try several variations of your address. I had the same issue for a week, turns out Gdax wouldn't verify unless is used "St" instead of "Street" as my address. After that it worked fine and I was able to transfer my BTC to Gdax for free transfer to my wallet.

Had the same problem this week. You should try verifying the information on coinbase rather than gdax. Upload your photo ID and fill out the information. Try different variations of your address. For me switching from "Lane" to "Ln" in the address bar fixed the issue.

Okay so let's assume Bitcoin replaces gold as the new store of wealth. If you divide the current market cap of gold by the total number Bitcoins you get roughly $300,000 per Bitcoin. Assuming Bitcoin reaches this price one day, that's a 5000% increase from $6000. If you put $300 into Bitcoin right now that will become $15000.

Honestly any amount you aren't willing to lose or you are seriously considering using as an investment, I would consider a large amount. 1 BTC is worth ~5,600 today but it could be $25,000k in 10 years. That's a substantial amount of money to lose.

A clean HDD wouldn't be enough. You'd want to have a dedicated, fresh PC, running Linux, that has never connected to a public network. You'd also have to run everything through Tails. 
Again, just a hassle to deal with if you don't have a lot of experience. If you want easy, no hassle, secure storage that will give you peace of mind and won't have you worrying "Did I do it right?", you should invest the $75 in a hardware wallet. Especially if you plan to store larg amounts of BTC or hold for a long period of time.

You have to add the USD to your "USD Wallet" on Coinbase and then transfer it to Gdax by going to on Gdax and selecting "deposit" and then selecting "Coinbase account" as the funding source

There should be a decent amount of videos explaining the most recent past fork (Bitcoin Cash). I would start there

Just get a hardware wallet or paper wallet
