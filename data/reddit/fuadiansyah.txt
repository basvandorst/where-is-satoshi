There are many banks that attach their brand as "sharia" in my country (Indonesia). But you know there is stereotype in our society that said, even sharia bank doesn't even apply the correct sharia law. So, a brand is just a brand.

[No, it's not](
Market price as the only data and fact isn't good enough to construct a proper conclusion, especially in tiny market consist of irrational retail investors. You need to gather and find more fundamental data...
By the way, thanks for the insight. Appreciate it. Saved...


Worse case scenario, it can be happen. Remember last bear market last for about 2-3 years.
But looking at fundamental I mentioned before, I believe it had smaller chance that it will happen again...

**It's history time! Below I present you the original text from which the legendary word "HODL" coming from.**
*I AM HODLING*
I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.
so i've had some whiskey
actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky

I think you're currently on your worst side of your bipolar. 
George Soros use currency as his investment vehicle to make profit.
The traits of currency are unit of account, medium of exchange, and STORE OF VALUE. You know other examples of store of value? It can be real estate, precious metal, gemstones, collectible, fine wine, etc. 
So there's nothing wrong with using currency as investment.
Now go back to school and learn more shit you dumbas. And don't forget to consume your bipolar medicine.

Accept it. Cashed out the amount that you need (e.g for food, bill, etc). Leave the rest. It would be better that way.

At this point, it's top 3 highest .org domain sales in 2017
When a business/organization spend that much money on a domain name, they surely expected the business not to be failed...
Edit: But I hope they failed :)))

They bought the domain last week for $48,888. 
They're really serious about this.

Make it or break it principle. At least for me.
You either lose all your invested money, or you'd have a huge gain.
Hence, don't invest the amount of money you're not willing to lose.
