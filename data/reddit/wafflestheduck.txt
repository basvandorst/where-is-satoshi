Is there a good place to store it off coin base for now at least?
Im using mycelium myself but i dont even fully trust it

300 here too.  Got it for my dad though since hes been having trouble getting verified.   
Whats the best wallet for a guy paranoid of being hacked?

I saw my first FB post about it from an older non tech lady last week.  
"Tell me everything you know about bitcoin."

Also "made"  $4 since my last post 4 hours ago.  Nuts.

I believe the amount it was at when you put in for the transfer applies so you might have made some dollars.
My friends transfer didnt go through so you might want to call your bank momday Monday to approve it since they might flag it an unusual purchase.

Ha.  Can I buy reddit gold with bit coin?

Yeah, didnt do too much.  I had really never been more confident in something like this before .    I think i might at least double my money,  then ill put the original amount back into my account. 
I think bitcoin could make good Christmas presents.

Made $46 in two weeks and I'm a broke girl who doesn't gamble or buy scratch tickets.   Hope i dont start to get confident in taking risks like this

You should get into stock options if you dont like risk.  Its like a second steady income

How much are fees right now? Sorry,  I've been out of the loop and need to move by from coinbase to copay and I it won't show me the fee before the next screen.   It's been awhile.  
Should I still go through gdax?
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:37:56
I went in at $7200, am I good?  
I feel like I'm watching a horror movie because I await your reply with my hand covering half of my eyes.
I need spoilers from another fan.

I don't even know what level it is. Ive been too terrified to check even  though I've been planning on holding. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:21:20
Yeah,  I already did it.  It's amazing how fast transfers are now compared to last October
