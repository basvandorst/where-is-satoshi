Create multiple backups of the file. Download bitcoin core or update to latest version. It will automatically place a wallet.dat file in the following directory when you first open it. Go ahead and open and close it to ensure all the necessary files are created.
Create a backup of the automatically generated wallet.dat file in case it holds bitcoin for one reason or another. Delete the new wallet.dat or cut/paste it elsewhere.
Put your wallet.dat (the one you found) file in the directory. Open bitcoin core and see how much it holds. You may have to download the entire blockchain (takes days) or you can copy the public address and search it on the block chain to see how much it holds. If change addresses were used you might have to wait to download the entire block chain to see true balance.
Also, before taking mine or anyone elses advice online take time to google and understand the directions I provided. People on here have scammed others so make sure you know what your'e doing.

I'll answer by paragraphs..
Paragraph 1: There will always be attacks on democracy but people believe the majority of people are good in nature (greater than 50%)
While people may not be interested in running full nodes how many people stand in lines to vote for the president of the US?
The US dollar is not ran by the people, we have no control. This is why Satoshi created bitcoin (duh???)
The ideal world doesn't exist in financials because the world hasn't been given the opportunity to. Cryptocurrency is literally the liberation of money; giving the power to the people in a decentralized format forced by open source code. You might start to care in this format.

@_date: 2017-12-21 07:58:26
This is an attack to centralize bitcoin in my opinion. Bigger blocks lead to very large block chains. The average joe will not have 100tb disk space to run a full node. Only corporations will be able to. Goodbye decentralization.

Depending on the wallet file the answer will be different. You should hook each drive up as a slave and search the contents for a wallet.dat file. Wallet.dat files are created in the core bitcoin wallet so if theres a wallet it will most likely be wallet.dat format.

Let me know when theres a government where each node votes for laws, regulations, departments budgets, whether or not we go to war, and much much more. I call it the government chain. A government for the people, by the people, forced by code on a decentralized platform.
Instead of asking politicians to vote one way or another it will be their job to educate the public on the vote/potential outcomes.

I couldn’t agree more. It’s a legitimate attack on bitcoin. I have seen 20+ people bitching about transaction costs and time on this sub. I’m sure there were plenty more. Increasing the block size is a terrible idea that will eventually force corporations to run data centers to run a single node. Takes away decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:42:40
Yeah if the interest rate is high it won't really work. However, interest rates are so low right now it might make sense to refinance and do this plan.

Trust me I don't have all of this figured out but I do know it's possible.
My idea would be to have a cooperation that gets its funding through the protocol. If they want their job they will do a good job managing the list. Also the list would be incorporated into the database. Thus making sure only people of the country can vote. If foul play is detected their funding gets cut by the protocol based on internet searches. 
Accountability where it matters.

Great points. Thanks for your inputs.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:30:49
Bitcoin is protocol, currency, payment network, and invention.
This post will talk about the invention and a small part of the currency.
So lets say you take a fraction of a bitcoin(currency) and say split it to the smallest units. Let's say you have 500 of these units.
You assign each one unit to be worth something that is redeemable. Since we are using bitcoin(invention) we can be assured that each unit is what it claims to be and can't be copied.
A couple things we could assign to our tiny units to; car title, house deed, tickets any event, gold, a big mac, a video game.... 
Are you starting to see the possibilities?
Another concept....
We can use a bitcoin like system to eliminate government and have it run by everyone........
So this is a lot and I have so many concepts and ideas but I need to keep it short.
Bitcoin allows for majority votes based from each node proven with proof of work (It can't be cheated)
We copy every law in existence today and let the voting begin, this will be hectic at first but great when it settles down and gets paved out.
If someone wants a law passed they can lobby for it, if they gain traction and stir enough media a code in the protocol can call for a vote.
Suddenly taxes don't need to be paid, the money will circulate evenly throughout our country and without socialism.
To keep this short I see two very important items that will need to be human ran for obvious reasons.. The good news is that it can be somewhat dictated by code and funding won't be released until jobs are done fair and to terms.
1. Our army and intelligence.
2. Someone to enforce the laws.
To end it; bitcoin is no where near any of this, we suck at digital security. But we will get there and the possibilities are mind blowing.

Not public. Only the corperation (I should really say "government agency") would know what names correspond to votes. However, the protocol only needs to know majority agrees. It doesn't have to keep record of who voted what.
We could even go way further to a 2 private keys 1 public type deal. I don't know much about it but symmetric keys might be what I'm looking for here.

It has to broadcast the tranasction to the network. So it has to be connected. However, you can make wallets offline you just can't spend them until you import the keys.
One more note: Trezor does almost what you are saying but it goes offline. The keys are hardware based I beleive so they would be impossible to hack.
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

How would you make sure people don't generate new keys?
My idea would be to have a cooperation that gets its funding through the protocol. If they want their job they will do a good job managing the list. Also the list would be incorporated into the database. Thus making sure only people of the country can vote. If foul play is detected their funding gets cut by the protocol based on internet searches. 
What do you do if a person's key is stolen?
Refer to corporation. Although it would be more of a Government agency.
 How does it search the internet?
Data mining. The NSA knows alllll about it.
What stops the commander of the military going to war even if everyone says they shouldn't?
he will have to get approval from a majority vote after two weeks into the war. If the majority of people wish to not have a war, the Bitcoin funding will not be released to the Military.

Yeah. Typing on an tablet so please excuse brevity and typos... Basically it's a nice way to mint new coins without all bitcoins flooding the market at once. Miners play a lottery to speak and try to solve a math problem. First one to guess the answer first wins 25 bitcoins. In 4 years the reward will be 12.5 then half again in another 4. It's pointless work but the reward is nice and is needed to maintain the blockchain and process transactions. The winner keeps the bitcoins.

There are fees for getting fiat to bitcoin and vice versus. Banks will charge you to move money and exchanges will charge a little too.
Strait from google here: An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day. Most ETFs track an index, such as a stock index or bond index.
So to answer your question it is sort of like an ETF but it's not on a major stock exchange. The Winklevoss twins plan to change this soon.

Honestly, if bitcoin needed something and the community wanted it / needed it it would be implemented into the bitcoin core chain. I honestly don't know the specific details but I know the community is strong.
The only way a true fork would be needed is if the original bitcoin core went awol and didn't believe or back the original principles (aka a decentralized currency period).
Edit: Nunya.

I mined a very small number of coins a while back. I have hodled the entire time. If you want to hedge against losing a lot instead of buying ex $1000 worth today just buy $100 per month.
Most of us believe bitcoin is extremely undervalued considering the potential it has in changing the way money works and numerous benefits. Most of us here are futurists and see so many possibilities when we think about bitcoins potential. But please do not invest more than you are willing to lose.

Personally I think it's simply growth at the moment. I certainly do not see the price rise to be significant enough for people to lose faith anytime soon in this rally considering all the news. However, if more and more good news comes in and the price gets to $5000 within the next three months we will see a correction "bubble".

The validation program is independent from the Bitcoin protocol - it just scans the block chain and categorizes coins / addresses.
Yes but we can change the Bitcoin code to render their program obsolete. This may be a bad idea but what if we took a stamp of all the coins right now and deleted all of the history. Clean coins.

We could use your expertise to work with a developer to create tax software with a focus on Bitcoin.

Every "stock" is volatile at the beginning before they are released to the general public, including Facebook and twitter. Legal issues arise, bugs in software, other players in the market etc. It will be very unlikely for volatility to happen when the market cap is over $100 billion.

I would suggest to get a woocommerce wordpress theme and set it up that way. You could download the Bitcoin Payments for WooCommerce app to accept bitcoin. IMO I would also allow paypal as a payment method as well (if they allow it).
This could be achieved overnight but it has limits. Basically users would have to pay per video and then download them. You could have a preview but would not be able to stream media or live media.

Yeah buy them locally, no one would ever know, except the seller. And only the US would do such a thing, I'm from the US but I'd still buy and mine. The price would just go off of non US countries (exchanges). I really don't believe US regulations will hurt bitcoin long term.

What about when I have a fresh wallet(1) and I deposit 1 Bitcoin to it. I then send .01 to another wallet(2). When I look in the bock-chain my fresh wallet 1 is empty. A change address has been made and my other .99 BTC lives there. (This made me panic once and I thought my coins were gone to a hacker.) That change address is necessary but it does not have a name to it. It's brand new. So how will this work? Seems impossible to me unless something (major) is changed.

I'm a miner, Look at dustcoin.com/mining
Mining skrypt coins is much more profitable as you can't use an ASIC to mine them.
ASICs are the reason why the difficulty is sky-rocketing.
If you don't want to invest in scrypt coins then trade them for BTC as soon as you get payouts.
Note: A lot of miners try not to get other's to mine as it would potentially take away their profits because the more people mining the higher the difficulty.
Edit: To actually answer your question: Probably not as better mining ASIC chips will be made. The demand is real.

Your money is secure, the consumer will pass some of the savings onto you.
Likely in the near future you can just buy in something and have them (bitcoins) be auto purchased in real time from your bank account.
How do you buy stuff with paypal? This is exactly the same with less fees.
Or do you just throw fiat at your screen?

But how would they know the coins are red until after they have been sent. Will they auto refund? There would have to be some editing of the bitcoin code for all of this to work.
If I send coins to an address there is no declining it the coins will move.
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:26:49
Yes the reason litecoin mining is more profitable on a graphics card is because it's scrypt hashing. Scrypt hashing requires memory to mine. Asics don't have any memory capabilities.

For a project in my class we are creating a program that will help military personnel create and review convoy information. We are doing this for free but we will have to put forth some money to pay for CD's and/or flash drives to distribute the software. I can provide proof for all of this, let me know.
Basically the issue is that when a convoy rolls they get handed a stack of papers that has the following information, vehicle order, personnel per vehicle, medics, drivers, radio frequencies. Our solution to this is to make a simple template that is guided by questions to provide a 1-2 page report with all of that information on it.
Basically when a convoy gets hit with an IED, an attack follows, a nice report on every vehicle window will save lives V.S. looking through 30 pieces of paper when seconds matter.

Getting tired I'll try to make them short.
1. Yes, the government can push it "underground" but it will still have some value. (Not sure how much but most likely less than they are now!)
2. People like Bitcoin to stay away from gov't fiat. We like it because it cannot be manipulated (print more to devalue it). We like it because it's so cheap to move money/assets around the world. We like our privacy (it's our god damn right). The government can do this but it may not have much adoption because it will just come with heavy regulation and fees for the regulation costs.
3. Again yes, more adoption will make it less volatile. And like I said before. Also it is peer-to-peer and 51% of the miners have to agree on new code. TRUE DEMOCRACY in the aspect of voting.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:48:16

@_date: 2013-11-15 18:41:25
People keep saying it will be built on top. But Ok let's say they do that. Then all we do (the miners) create a new code for bitcoin that makes their tracking system obsolete. These may be poor but here is a couple ideas: We can always do better.
1. Wipe the block chain history and essentially start fresh.
2. Have coins be bounced all over before reaching it's destination.
Note: You have to realize the USA is small and china will fork anything they do.

That's not why a discount should be used. Set up with a site like coinbase and have the coins be directly sold for USD as they are sent to you. Unless you want to gamble. Reason why you should accept BTC.
1. Very small to ZERO fees.
2. No chargebacks!
3. No fraud!
This means once the bitcoins are sent to you they are yours. They (buyers) cannot call their credit card company and block the transaction. Or say they did not authorize the purchase.

Hmm, cgminer (advanced) or GUIminer (noob).
1. Understand it will take a very long time for a ROI, 6 months minimum unless price skyrockets.
2. Build a really solid computer that you can use. So if things turn south you still have something.
3. Install at least 2 bad ass high end graphics cards for mining scrypt (Litecoin is stable for this).
4. Sell your LTC for BTC or hoard your Litecoins.
5. In one year, hopefully profit.
Asics cannot mine scrypt so there is a better chance for a ROI.

Whatever system they have to track addresses and coins can be rendered useless with us orphaning the old code and implementing a way to manipulate addresses and make coins a lot harder if not impossible to track (just delete all history and mix them). They would have to "convince" (pay off) 51% of the miners.
