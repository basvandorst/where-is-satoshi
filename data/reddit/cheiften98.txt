good think i look at lots of news sources. why would you tel someone that likes Trump to "wave a confederate flag"?  
you're so delusional if you think pro Trumpers are like that. the nicest people i know lean right not left. the left have always been the real racists. they used to lynch people but now they want to control them.

rip not going all in with my coinbase wallet a few hours ago. luckily i got in with a little.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:32:28
i was just stating a fact, you can intemperate however you like. 
rip karma.
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:23:54
"Trump cant thing for himself" yep,  not heard that before.
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:40:44
i dont wanna fomo in with rest of my wallet now
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:16:37
wait longer. this is gonna keep going down imo. i rekon we go as low as 8k or lower.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:21:08
im not the one whose lying.

here, left wing garbage even shows it.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:49:23
hmm, this is one thing i disagree with Trump on.  We'll have to see what happens.  This might just be a fad, I think a digital currency will be the future but i dont know if bitcoin will be it.
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:03:51
i think you're all misinterpreting it....
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:00:17
you know Trumps worth has gone down 1 billion since he got in office, Obamas when in office went up 50 million, Clintons 400million. but nonono Trump is trying to make money. kk
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:13:09
that might make sense.
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:25:56
lmao. i think you're in for a surprise at 2020 that you wont like.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:06:28
eyy i can chat now. weird. maybe a mod activated me or something.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:42:36
has 4 billion, 73 years old. "i know, ill run for President just so i can get richer" pepega makes sense
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:55:44
ive had my account for 2 years but only in the last couple of weeks ive started using reddit.
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:11:40
pepega, cause i wasnt talking about CNBC.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:52:52
where has he said that? If he has i would disagree with him but i dont see it on his Twitter.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:23:02
ye im only 21 ahha, the £100 i originaly invested im going to save for a while but the extra £100 i was gonna put in i was going to draw out when it goes up.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:23:29
ye i got really fucking scared earlier. and i made a bad call.
now thinking about it im not sure if it was a good thing, what if it kept on plummeting, every update my portfolio was going down £10. but it was also bad now knowing its probably going to keep climbing.   
I do believe bitcoin is the future because there is no middleman, no need for banks or paypal to take a fee with every  transaction.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:16:55
what do you mean by manipulation? bit of a noob to bitcoin. like whales purposely trying to crash it?
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:35:33
im going to start losing if it drops more. really nervous.
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:53:43
ye i heard there is a switch mini and a  more powerful in the works. ill get which the more powerful or the standard one.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:36:53
what do you mean 30k halving in may 2020?
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:19:42
nice guy
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:29:09
i was in 6form when i heard about it in computing and IT class. it was around £1000. coinbase wasnt a thing (or i just never heard of it then) its so confusing using the other sites. coinbase is nice as you can instant trade.
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:54:59
im gonna keep that £100 in my account. worked it out if bitcoin becomes 1million that £100 will be worth £10k so that would be a nice deposit on a house.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:36:27
ive invested only £370. im probably worrying about nothing. ill check him out. when do we know when its a full on crash, because i fucked up and panicked, sold it all, bought it back  sold it all then bought again. (so god damn retarded).  
hopefully none of this will matter in a months time.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:01:45
is that what this drop is at the moment? its just temporary.    
im so nervous atm.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:09:03
i was watching my portfolio g from £500 down to £450 dropping £10 each time i looked. was £550 before the crash.
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:04:31
so i bought 200 euros of bitcoin, 50 euro of etherium and 10 euro of litecoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:26:13
appreciate the long response. im glad you paid your debt off. a lot to think about aha
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:33:57
i had around 550 but then broke even when i drew out when that last drop happend. bought another 100 today and i think im just gonna try and forget about it. i guess we;ll just see.  
i think it doesnt help that people are using bitcoin as stocks instead of a currency.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:53:41
it does look good. i wanna  play mario lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:50:12
i hope so dude.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:42:15
i sold 10mins ago. was i right to do that? was at £540 now £450 D:
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:08:25
why would it just drop 500 just now?
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:04:28
for me, i made 6 euro profit. i was trying to sell when it started crashing but coinbase went down. i  then made many mistakes of selling, buying over and over. i was tilted. im just glad ive not lost any.   
im going to take this as a good learning experience. crocodile tooth im never buying again. bought 410 euro in total and sold at 416.78
  
I hope no one made any losses.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:28:06
well ive got £100 which is now £175-£180. looking to get some more as it did go up to £500 last year. was going to keep the £100 in for a long time but was looking to make enough to buy a switch haha.
i know most people invest way more but its all im comfortable with.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:07:49
are we crashing right now?
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:29:37
ok i re bought, fuk im nervous.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:55:37
its dropping again... whats going on?
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:15:13
so i bought £100 in 2017, then the last 2 days i bought £200, £50 ETH and £10 LTC, bought another £40 BTC earlier and converted my ETH and LTC into BTC. so not really any growth on the recent invesments but the original im up. so not lost any but not sure weather i should rebuy now.   
i guess its all just luck. just seeing what others think as im a noob at this.
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:38:48
today. i wasnt sure if bitcoin normally drops on mondays after big spikes. well i cant even buy any atm because i updated my phone on my bank account, go to purchase and the natwest phone code verification thing doesnt pop up with my new number. have to wait. feelsbad
