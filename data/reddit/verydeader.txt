I bought 3 bitcoins on coinbase when they were $250 each. I thought of buying 10 but didnt. Well, whatever. tried to make a few bucks. Didnt happen, a few months later a take out $630 of the $750 and put it into my brokerage account..LOOOOL
Let's be real though, i probably would have sold at $300, $500 maybe even $1000!!

They're just talking out of their bungholes. 
NOBODY can tell the future. It's wishful thinking. 
Trying to sucker people into buying to limit their losses.
 They're on the verge of a mental breakdown but are trying desperately to not hang themselves.

Yay! I can skip the 2.9%+ .30 cent Paypal fee!!!!
Oh wait that's the exact same fee Braintree charges.
To be fair though, the first 50k is fee free.....
Also, there is a 1% fee to cash out to your bank, Paypal has no fee for that...

"I'm fucking done. I run a site, spend thousands of hours of time, thousands of dollars of my OWN money to run it, decide to shut down, and somehow, through ways I cannot even figure the hell out, someone gets in, uploads files to the server, somehow finds the goddamned BTC wallet on the network, and it appears that they slammed it with withdraw requests."
Wow, "hackers"*wink* should all die!!!

Cool, wish they let me buy AT LEAST $5.00 WORTH OF BITCOIN INSTEAD OF CANCELLING EVERYTHING!!!
