Looks like $ is pouring from alts back into big daddy.

Holy shit, I better sell all my bitcoin. Thanks 'bubble pop soon'! Great insight.

I'm in Australia, we can't use a lot of exchanges like GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:02:45
I got in at 14550. Balls of steel dude �� that was some scary shit.

Buy with coinbase transfer to a hardware wallet, buy small amounts, and be prepared to hold for a year or two at the very least. Only put in what you are prepared to lose.

GDAX shat itself on me when I tried to buy at 12.7k
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:05:57
Holy shit
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:14:20
That was brilliant. Just bought at 12.36k and it's already back up to 12.7

Was about 10% but had quickly grown to be over 50%
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:04
I don't think I can do this as an Australian.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:38:29
I can't use GDAX in Australia.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:13:08
My pay came in just as it dipped below 18k. Beautiful timing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:42:22
I've also been interested in the high BTC markets price compared to Coinbase. Has just encouraged me to buy more BTC, which seems to be a good play at the moment haha

@_date: 2017-12-30 13:23:39
Bought at 12.9k ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:19
Buy consistent small amounts (dollar cost average). IF you buy a large amount at a high it will feel really bad.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:56:18
You get to watch GDAX charts and become a zombie with dollar signs in your eyes
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:13:47
Is that because of the futures? Or because of the ridiculous growth? Or both?
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:59:18
I'm just using Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:06:57
It's been 20k on coinbase for a while. Has been $21k on btc markets all day, even hit 22k at one point.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:33:46
It's a satirical piece. This website is quite popular in Australia at the moment

I'm going in at 17,100 come to papa
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:58:23
Hmm that's odd, I'm an Aussie and had a $500 limit for a while, now have a $2000 limit. To be completely open with you, I have invested about $4k into bitcoin through coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:32:08
Asap. Buy bitcoin, not bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:59:09
I free carried myself too....at 9.5k. Regret it massively!

What part of frozen do you not understand
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:27:16
Is buying irrational? That's what I'm doing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:03:57
I blame Keenan Allen 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:16:54
Im getting reluctant to do so nowadays with the current transfer fees. Until I accumulate around $500 worth I just leave it on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:10:20
Stabilizing is not boring. Consolidation is needed to increase prices over time
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:06:21
Nah I've always been a 'buy the dip' kinda guy. Never buy at the ATH
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:05:34
Waiting for my coinbase limit to refresh haha
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:48:36
14k you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:16:05
Agreed. People that think this way are the people that don't really believe in bitcoin as a currency. For it to succeed we need as many people as possible to accumulate and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:18:04
I bought at 4.5k approx on average and have sold half my holdings at 9.7k. Am now free carried. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:53:21
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:01:50
I'll answer honestly. I own a quarter of a bitcoin. I plan on slowly buying more until I have one bitcoin, want to own a whole one by the end of the year. I plan on sitting on my bitcoin until 2020. Am buying from coinbase in Australia and am storing my coin on a Trezor wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:07:37
Any idea which exchanges are open to Aussies? GDAX is, Gemini isn't.
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:10:44
$7393 AUD on Coinbase.
