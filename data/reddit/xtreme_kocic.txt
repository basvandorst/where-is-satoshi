But I'm not claiming that Bitcoin has never had consistent growth??

FUD = fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The posts regarding QuadrigaCX didn't definitely specify what they believe will happen with the exchange, instead the posts conveyed their fear, uncertainty and doubt about the exchanges ability to stay solvent and not be shady. So yeah the posts had lots of FUD about QuadrigaCX and they were right. FUD and being right aren't mutually exclusive.
If I'm seeing it the wrong way please explain

Yeah that 22 LTC represented like 20% of my entire stack so it's a tough pill to swallow that I just lose 20% of my entire stack.
My only option moving forward us to not let it get to me, and keep accumulating in weekly basis. 
Hopefully it gets resolved as well and I have a chance of getting my coins back

I purchased all my coins on Coinbase and would transfer to QuadrigaCX to trade, while a good portion of my stack was in cold storage I still kept about 50 Litecoins in QuadrigaCX for trading. When I started reading a large number of FUD posts about QuadrigaCX I began withdrawing all my ~52 coins. 
I first did a 30 coin withdrawal, then a 22 coin withdrawal. Both of these transactions were started on January 3rd... 2 weeks later 30 successfully withdraws, but my last 22 coins were 'pebding' for weeks more and then the  company went out.. that's that

Thanks for the tip I'll keep a close eye on the developments of the situation. I'm just glad I got at least 30 of the 52 coins out, otherwise I would he in a way worse position right now

That sounds interesting I'll have to do the math when I get home and see what it comes out to based on the dates I bought in st throughout the past 17 months.
In either case, during the next year crypto gains are gonna stomp on sp500 gains by a ridiculous margin
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:30:29
50% gain in the past 30 days... Over 100% gain since the year began

By that definition Bitcoin has never been in a bull market since it's creation ..
Which you know to be a ridiculous thing to claim

Nice and safe in my nano ledger of course, lesson learnt.

If we are expecting the price to gain a lot of % over the next year.. wouldn't you agree that buying regularly over the next 52 will unnecessarily increase your DCA? 
Why buy a part of BTC at 9k,10k,11k,12k,13k.... Etc..
Instead of biting the bullet short term and buying at 8k with all your funds?
Yes you risk the price doing a retrace a couple percent, but that beats having to buy it at 15k as opposed to today for 8k
I totally agree with the idea of doing DCA during a bear market.. however it seems like a bad idea during a bull market Imo
