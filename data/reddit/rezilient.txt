I think its important to note how much money has been invested in Bitcoin and cryptos in general. Anyone who’s saying crypto currency has no future is a luddite and doesn’t grasp the concept. BUT this doesn’t necessarily mean that Bitcoin Core will be THE commodity/currency to own. Nobody gives a shit about Alta Vista or Ask Jeeves any more, right? But the Internet still exists and is thriving.

I dont know about you but if someone sent me 1 BTC i’d accept it has plenty of value. Whether that value is equal to $100 USD or $1000 USD or $10000 USD it doesn’t change the fact that it has value since I know there are millions of miners and nodes holding the network together. It has value because the community gives it value.

To anyone who was mining back when it wasn’t easy to mine Bitcoin, they supported the network and got things running for everyone. Before the institutional and industrial Chinese miners came online. I used to import Bitcoin mining machines like the original AsicMiner Block Erupter to the USA. I hope all the people who bought machines from me are doing really well right now. I wish I bought some BTC for myself at the time. :(

You’re attitude is awesome man, and I’m right there with you. I bought, sent and sold so much BTC through 2014-2016 that I’m embarrassed to tell anyone. But now I just HODL a little bit and it makes me feel alright. Our initial faith and commitment to Bitcoin is a big reason why it is where it is.

I’ve also seen calculations that try to estimate value per coin based on market cap and circulation. But I assume it’s more complicated than that. Curious to know the answer as well.

Just hold on and forget about it for 1 year. The more you watch the crazier you’ll get. But long term I think there’s no doubt it will be higher than the current price because I believe in the tech. Question is how long.

I'm not sure if or why Coinbase would divulge that info but I don't really see the concern. For example if I buy something via PayPal and use my bank account as the funding source would they have visibility into that? I'd assume its the same visibility as a Coinbase transaction. Perhaps it is the amount being transferred to Coinbase which raised question sunce it was a significant amount. We were paying our product vendor in China via BTC since it was much quicker and we both saved on fees.

With all those whitepapers he's written surely someone could compare the writing style to the Bitcoin paper and see if there are similarities.

I'm fine with that, and it is reasonable to flag a new seller who's hocking miners, but considering my track record of selling on eBay for over 10 years, grossing over $20-30K in sales over the past year, and 550+ 100% positive feedback rating I think it is unreasonable that they would immediately freeze my account after the first week of selling miners. There is something else going on here.

Hi Max. I had the exact same situation happen when I started selling Bitcoin mining machines. They froze my account and it took some solid effort to get it unfrozen. Its still slightly crippled 8 months later because there is a mandatory reserve requirement, meaning they need to hold 20% of each payment for 90 days. 
Basically you need to make sure you ship those Paypal transactions that they flagged ASAP.  However in my case they said ALL pending shipments need to show up as delivered in the tracking before they would unlock my account. PM me if you need any more info about the process. Call them every day and request status, and you have the right to record those calls.  
Btw I bought a coin from you, but I used BTC. :)
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:54:28

I've been selling on eBay since 2003. I've done a decent $20K in volume since September on Android media boxes, giving eBay and Paypal tons of fees. I start selling AsicMiner Cubes and Avalon miners on eBay and BOOM - my Paypal account is frozen. Spoke to their underwriting department and they said Bitcoin related items are high risk, hence the extra attention. They have put a 90 day reserve on my account, so that funds sitting in Paypal need to be there for 90 days before I can withdraw. Complete bullshit. I need to figure out how I can accept Bitcoin through my eBay auctions...

As an eBay seller who uses Paypal heavily it is SUPER easy as a customer to get your money back. You open a dispute, the funds are put on hold in the sellers account, and more often than not they side with the customer.

Amazing article, thanks for sharing. Curious how "proof of stake" (such as what Ethereum is working towards) will compare to the authors vision of a more fair and even currency distribution model. My feeling is that it's even more centralized than Bitcoin.

Article refers to Ryan Taylor (Dash Network) as "Dash said..." in the last paragraph instead of by his name.

Sad to say its a "shelf" in my lab server rack
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:46:07
Good fricken point. With that much BTC and the potential growth it makes sense to hodl and live off the coins. Pull some for fiat (diversify) in case shit goes south.

This is genius. I'm copying this idea, thanks man.

“... too many shortcomings to be seriously considered...” 
How many people have made that exact same statement about cryptos over the recent years. We are witnessing something incredible right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:08:50
Maybe you should have explained it a bit better so she can benefit from all things Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 04:16:36
Should have hired Zuckerberg.

I am pretty heavily invested in BTC and had no idea it was such a big deal. Great article. And now I'm more than a little bit worried. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:14:08
Hey. Send 20 BTC to me and I will explain exactly what you need to do to run the coins through tumblers and spread them out quickly.     38nNvHJRRrV6a4ZiBATKSmJ9bUvxwPo5m3

He said the exact same thing in the Rise Of Bitcoin doc. He is definitely anti establishment and probably needs to tone it down a notch or two if he's to be taken seriously as a CEO. Not that i disagree, but I want to see him successful and.. alive.

What's happening with NEO?

Some of the replies to that are very sad. Ok all the replies.

LOL recently? It was less than $5000 a month ago and $3000 90 days ago. Bitcoin is a crazy ride.  
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:26:23
Same question, because it just looks so scammy.

Coinbase: "11.2000 BTC will arrive in your My Wallet account on Tuesday Jul 14, 2015."

Do you mean send BTC to BTC from Coinbase to GDAX and then withdrawing to fiat has no fees? I’ve been paying way too much in Coinbase fees.

All that crazy tech leading up to a single fricken Bitmain miner. So anticlimactic... :(

Yes. Please.

Newb question - WHY cant that be the case? I mean after a "feature" has been developed, tried and tested thoroughly on an Altcoin why cant it be rolled into Bitcoin?

I'm done with eBay. They suspended my 13 year old seller account because they suspect fraud due to too many unpaid item cases... Umm your idiot customers don't pay for the goods they won! Screw eBay.

I have yet to see what Voat even looks like. I think it's pretty much lost any potential of being a contender.

Ok I've waiting long enough. Time to buy more Bitcoin.

What do you mean? I was thinking maybe they don't have proper licensing to use the super bowl name..  Unless Inuit has their own game called the "big game" that i'm not aware of.

I'm a noob when it comes to this debate but his explanation makes a lot of sense. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:26:04
I don't follow sports so be gentle - By "big game" do they mean the super bowl? Because i wasn't able to find the answer , on the site they vaguely refer to it as the "big game" everywhere.

Here is what I see on my iPhone 6+
Edit: clicking the link above the barcode opens my Coinbase app which is nice. Although for noobs like myself it might be confusing, or maybe I'm an idiot. But there are a lot of us. :)
@_date: 2016-02-19 22:26:13
Can the mobile experience be improved? How do I scan the barcode when I'm using my only phone capable of scanning it.

So what does this mean? Sorry I've been following BTC for quite a while but simply can't keep up with all the infighting and drama.

That was the first and last episode of Black Mirror we watched. I’m afraid of what else their demented minds came up with.

Jennifer Lowney, head of corporate communications at Citigroup, said the bank took issue with the IMF’s analysis."We don’t understand how they reach their conclusions and disagree with them."
Maybe saying you "don't understand" is not the best PR strategy here. It sure doesn't instill confidence.

Some ISP's don't give you access. Our Charter Business account uses a run of the mill SMC cable modem but we have to call them to do simple things like DNS or DHCP settings.

Sorry for your shitty situation, that guy deserves to be behind bars. On a positive note I'm really pleased to see that so many people were using your ATM, and right here in Atlanta too. That's awesome.

Damn, didn't think about all the SR patrons who were spending and growing the economy. Kudos to you. Makes me feel less shitty about selling 20+ coins back in 2015 when we were in the $300-400 slump. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 02:38:05
Tell me about it. I sold dozens of BTC back when it was stagnant in the $300-400 range. Oh well. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:43:07
Which state? And why?
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:00:39
Sell your whole portfolio. Wait for Aug 1st. Buy them back at a reduced price on the chain of your choice. Still hodling. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:43:42

Stupid question but Is it possible the users had the private key and still have control on the wallet? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:10:55
You mean the uber drivers? Or they did this to actual employees?
