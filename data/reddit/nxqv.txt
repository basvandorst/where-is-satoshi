You know it's actually really easy for governments to track down and shut down miners right? And without miners the whole thing just ceases to function
They can be tracked down through KYC and trade records from exchanges, monitoring electricity usage in buildings like warehouses (Iran recently caught some people trying to secretly mine crypto in mosques which have publicly subsidized electricity), and demanding sales records from hardware vendors
That's a big part of why it is so dangerous to have so much mining concentrated in China. Out of all the governments on earth they are probably top 5 in the most likely to crack down on it
They can shut it down with a wide variety of techniques ranging from SWAT teams conducting physical hardware seizures to cyberattacks (infecting known mining rigs with malware)
Frankly people make snarky posts like yours all the time and it is just incredibly naive. Governments are the most powerful institutions on the planet and there is nothing that comes close, not even international megacorps, because they have a monopoly on force. If they ever perceive Bitcoin as a real threat to their power, they can and will act on it.

No. All alts are coupled to BTC/ETH right now, and those two exert some gravity on each other as well, because you largely still need to convert to them to get back into fiat. When people are panic selling they're generally converting to those 2 coins and moving them to coinbase and then selling for USD.
That's why a few days before an altcoin boom you'll see BTC gain. And likewise if there's an altcoin dump you might not see BTC fall until the next day.

Global government isn't going to happen. We are trending towards decentralization, not centralization, because that is what is the most economically efficient. Bitcoin is decentralized, so it wouldn't really pair well with a centralized government. I think that even on the local level, the global marketplace will become a stronger force in people's lives than the government. Think about it, the world as we know it is a free-for-all decentralized conglomerate of nations. It took millennia to get to this point. The global economy is just increasingly mirroring that.

Logistics, partially. Codifying it like that forces the banks to do some of the dirty work. The IRS doesn't have the resources to sift through every single banking transaction in the country, that'd require an operation bigger than the IRS itself. But they can definitely look at every $10000+ transaction, plus any sub-$10000 transaction that the banks have already looked at and deemed "suspicious."
But mostly because the lawmaker who made this bullshit was at least somewhat well-meaning and was unfortunately too oblivious and out of touch to know how their previous laws have been enforced in such a blanket manner.

Or you could hit the "Buy now" button, and it generates a new wallet address specific to that transaction and a QR code pops up on your screen as well. The order gets automatically completed as soon as that address has the correct number of bitcoins (let's say you have ~10 minutes to send the coin to protect them from volatility.)

Mt. Gox was anything but a vault. It was only an exchange; somewhere that people can "meet up" and buy/sell bitcoins from each other. Nothing more, nothing less. Storing your coins in Mt. Gox is like keeping all your money on a forex site, you just wouldn't really feel safe or smart doing it if you know what you're doing.
The nature of cryptocurrency means that something like a bank isn't completely relevant in the world of Bitcoin; assuming you take the appropriate security measures (which is often easier said than done; you often have to make a tradeoff between security and convenience), your bitcoins are probably better off in your own hands than in the hands of a third party. The closest thing we have to banks are online wallets, which are managed by a third party and you typically, with a few exceptions, don't have access to the private keys for those wallets.

They are public. In practice, the idea is to disconnect you from a particular address; you don't tumble and send back to the same address.
Let's say you're starting off from an address that is undeniably yours--maybe your Coinbase address, it's linked to your bank account and has your name all over it as a result. You put your coins into a tumbler, but so do 1000 other people. You then take them out by withdrawing to a brand new address. Now, by looking at the blockchain, there's nothing linking those two addresses of yours together besides the fact that you used the same tumbler--but so did 1000 other people.

I'm not trying to wholesale rail on the banks here as I've worked in the industry, for some of these banks, you're largely right but I have 3 points to make here:
1 you don't need to be as large of an institution as Wells Fargo or BoA to provide those services to individuals or small businesses. In practice those groups are often much better serviced by smaller community banks and credit unions. For example competition for homeowners is far better for us than Wells Fargo servicing well over half of mortgages. HOWEVER
2 you do need to be that large to service large multinational corporations, and in that field even these banks do not individually want to take on all the risk for things like huge deals in the IB side. That's why they work together on those deals. And it plays a big part in their everlasting desire to grow. Because bigger banks are better able to mitigate risk in these large lucrative deals.
3 so the thing is these banks on the list, particularly the top ones, got this big through their predatory practices in their consumer banking arms. Particularly Wells Fargo and BofA, they have huge consumer arms and relatively small IB arms so they had to leverage their overall might to strengthen their investment business. And that unfortunately means criminality 
So yeah banking is a huge necessity for how our economy functions. And at the same time fuck these banks for being rotten to the core

This will prove to be unpopular here but I think the downturn will actually wreck bitcoin adoption.

The market will shrink to just contain the hodlers and the wealthy. So the entire thing will rely on whether the wealthy actually understand its use case enough to continue using it amongst themselves (they currently don't)

I think that beyond that market risk, it is an extremely clever scheme to effectively counterfeit USD. And the only way to kill it is to stop supporting it so it never reaches the point where merchants will accept it. Or if the US government somehow stepped in and purchased Tether or made their own government-sanctioned stablecoin, but then that opens up a new avenue of QE

Remember that graph that was posted the other day that showed the USD/BTC ratio at an all time low? And the comments were all saying it's an example of the effects of QE. The thing is, BTC's "USD" price is actually a combination of USD+stablecoins. And when Tether prints hundreds of millions of fake-USD, almost all of that is being spent on BTC and directly impacting the price far more than the QE dollars are. (We all know the insane Tether supply is not actually backed by USD as they claim, that much is obvious)
Mark my words, one day, when crypto reaches mass adoption, all of that fake-USD from Tether et al. is going to be unleashed on the real world market and wreak havoc

That's cool and all but trust does fuck all when it comes to fees and confirmation times.
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:23:06
First some info to chew on:
Remember that most of the USD supply is actually not printed in cash and only exists digitally. And that also directly impacts the human psyche's relationship to our money - it's just numbers on a screen so in a monkey brain sense, the line between dollars and tether is quite blurry. 
Also look at the way people use Tether today - primarily as a liason between USD and BTC, to shield themselves from market movements, cashing out without having to cash out. Right now, Tether prints only 100 million ish every once in a while, with nearly $4b in circulation total, whereas actual QE from the Fed is on the order of tens of billions per month. 
Meanwhile QE is being used to fuel the wealthy's addiction of hoarding disgusting amounts of money while providing us masses with enough peanuts to survive - it's a way to slow down the mass redistribution of wealth that has been ocurring over the past 30 years, and without it, capitalism would have surely crumbled after 2008. 
BTC, which originally intended to pave the way for a mass redistribution of wealth, is rapidly being coopted by this wealthy class. With a supply of 21 million coins many of which are lost to time, it's already at the point where if you own 1 BTC you are part of an elite club. Bitcoin is basically digital gold with similar amounts of legend and allure backing it up, and whatever technological bullshit they do to the platform will not change that. Ultimately things like BCH are fool's gold because it lacks the legend of the OG bitcoin. 
And as a result, the cryptocurrency that will be used as day to day money likely does not exist yet.
Now, imagine a scenario where major businesses adopt BTC en masse. 
When large companies and hundreds of millions of people start using BTC, the demand for stablecoins will skyrocket as well, and they will have to print many billions per month to keep up with demand. And effectively you will see the digital supply of USD rapidly morph into a supply of stablecoins. This isn't necessarily a bad thing on its own. 
Forget Tether for a moment, I think a stablecoin with sub-cent tx costs and millisecond confirms is what it will take for every man, woman, and child to transition from fiat to crypto. In a world where BTC is being primarily used as a store of wealth by rich people and has long confirmation times and high tx fees, LN is still struggling to come online for regular use, and basically every other crypto is a shitcoin or unusable as money, stablecoins are going to be the best way for people who just don't care about the inner workings of money to digitize their assets while having their digital money protected from volatile market movements. And it helps monkey brain dramatically that $1 = 1 stablecoin. So people will ultimately start using stablecoins as day to day currency, unless we come up with an alternative usable companion cryptocurrency for BTC for people to spend on stuff.
Currently stablecoins are "backed by fiat in reserve" but in this scenario that statement will be meaningless, as stablecoins will supplant traditional currency in day to day use, making that reserve just dead weight. This revolution will destroy banking as we know it. And it will happen very fast, over the course of a couple of years.
But as that transformation is progressing, what actually happens? You have a massive supply of fiat already in the market. You have QE pouring money in monthly. And you have privately issued stablecoins pouring just as much money in while sucking up fiat for their reserves. What will ensue is a period of utter chaos as the Fed is unable to granularly control the money supply, the value of USD starts to plummet as these mass printed stablecoins are diluting the supply since they are being accepted as equal substitutes by the free market, companies are flocking even further to BTC to store their digitized wealth and keep it safe, and eventually the government will step in and either kill off their own money or crypto.
That's why we need government to step in early and issue a stablecoin, kill off these frauds, and ideally divert their QE to it, so the average person's wealth isn't completely destroyed in the transition to cryptocurrency.
Of course the government is not going to do shit, because they are slow and stupid when it comes to tech. So on top of that shitfest, imagine that stablecoin is Tether, created and run by 1 company with a shady, corrupt history, that has basically empowered itself to print fiat money at will and does so on the backs of other cryptocurrency networks of varying reliability, trustworthiness, and usefulness (did you know they have some Tether on TRON and that they plan to expand to EOS, two noted shitcoins?). Do you trust that it will go well?

I disagree. I think Bitcoin is a bad match for Uber. The way their service works is absolutely seamless with credit and debit cards - you store your card number, hail a car whenever you want (it does give you a fare estimate range) and it'll just charge your card when you get out of the car - no further user interaction required. Adding Bitcoin support would either add some clunk to the process or it would defeat the purpose of using Bitcoin in the first place.

The 10 year Treasury rate is 2.44%, and it was around 1.8% last year. I don't know how much more "reasonable" you want to get. If you wanna give me a loan at 2% interest, hell yeah I'll take it.
Also taxes aren't the only way we pay off treasuries. We can also issue new ones to pay off the old ones and we do. We can sell other assets or make other adjustments to our budget. And we have the advantage of literally printing the currency we owe our debt in.
The US isn't a company but it's not a human being either. It would behoove you to pause here and learn how Treasuries work, particularly because they underlie the entire global marketplace.
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:32:35


2% is 2% whether you're a dog or a human. Borrowing money is expensive and 2% is a relatively cheap source of money.




The graph includes the principal...meaning the government under Obama borrowed a metric fuckton of money. A lot of it was in the aftermath of the recession and had to be done, but there's also a lot of that increase that in my view is a cause for alarm. Not because we're gonna go broke or anything like that; the alarm comes from what we're actually spending it all on.


It is kicking the can down the road. But by all economic metrics the US government is stable enough to do that and still be seen as a reliable group to extend credit to. Basically when you're the lynchpin of the global economy and not Zimbabwe, you can kick the can down the road and reasonably expect to afford it later on, too. That's not necessarily a bad financial practice; individuals and companies do it too. It's just a matter of stability and knowing what you can and can't afford to do. 
Also the regularity of Treasury payments is a crucial tool and an integral part of the backbone of the financial system. There's a reasonable guarantee that the vast, vast, vast majority of our payments due won't be recalled early.


Income inequality has nothing to do with the Treasury rate and everything to do with much much broader socioeconomic and geopolitical problems. That's a different discussion entirely.
