From the early 90s-96 the NSA was OPENLY investigating cryptographic money networks.
One of their researchers and investigators is a man named Tatsuaki Okamoto. When they actively started writing the code they chose the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamura" to ultimately promote the idea that Tatsuaki Okamoto to any and all who investigated the source of bitcoin long enough. But Tatsuaki Okamoto is just a cog. He's not some rogue savoir out to topple centralized banks. Not at all. He is a crypto scientist who was paid by government and intelligence agencies to do research.

I like bitcoin but became too involved in the price.. I still have some but sold off most of it after i became an obsessive bitcoin whore. I have a feeling most of the people on r/bitcoin just care about the price. .. If you wanna gamble go over to r/weedstocks.  Its like 2012 in bitcoin year over there.

That's why there is bitcoin difficulty. Even a 4th/s miner that hasnt even shipped yet is almost out of date. Bitcoin could be 10,000USD percoin, if it takes a $10,000,000 machine to mine a few coins a day

Man up little girl 
Good luck trying to buy again

If I were a bank id take 2 to 5 days to clear a check as well. I sure as hell wouldn't cash a different banks check on the spot. 
Christ kid are you 12? Go watch catch me if you can. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:43:45
I have.  Thanks for the tip
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:21:42
I was on that $4500 contract and backed out...after more careful difficulty calculations. 
The owner clearly hadn't done his homework. Glad I invested it back in BTC. The guy (if the same one) hasn't even ordered the equipment yet.
I won't be mining any time soon... just as much as I don't pan gold. I buy it.
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:22:16

not usually this large but yes
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:29:58
ps.. never account for BTC price increase when doing calculations.. if you do that.. you might as well just invest in bitcoin and not mine
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:30:55
Do they mine on your equipment before they ship it?  
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:53:46

They doubled their stake

The last mini crash scared me but I realized bitcoin doesn't give a shit about a country.  Bitcoin is bitcoin and is a honey badger.  
I'm more confident than ever

bitcoin is about to take over the fucking world
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:41:29
Quick question.. who is going to spend bitcoin now?? I read an article about a guy who bought a sub a few weeks ago with bitcoin... ok.. now this week if you look at it he now paid like $25 for that $5 sub. Nobody in their right mind would buy things with bitcoin if the value keeps going up. I'm hoarding them and so are all my friends.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:05:13
See you hit the nail on the head.. not only do you have to know when to buy, you have to know when to sell... It's what drove people to jump off buildings in 1929... 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:49:25
My buddy urged me to buy when it was .23 cents. I didn't.  I laughed when it hit $40.. and cried when it hit $1000
I think I cried more than when I watched the notebook
Needless to say I have less than 20 now

The points on an elliptic curve can be added  and similarly can be subtracted. By repeated addition, you get multiplication of a point by an integer. 
The curve that is used in Bitcoin has the property that from a single point G, (for generator point) by repeatedly adding it to itself you get every point (with integer coordinates) on the elliptic curve.
In elliptic curve cryptography a private key, k, is simply an integer, and the public key is the point you get by adding G to itself k times. Given a general point on the curve, there is no known way to get back to the number k without simply trying every one until you get lucky.
The recovery of the Sony keys was because of a flaw in their implementation of the signing algorithm. The algorithm requires a random number which should be different every time something is signed. Sony used the same number every time and this allowed the private key to be recovered (though of course it took a long time before anyone realized that they were always using the same number). The signature is dependent on the random number, so repeatedly signing the same message should give a different signature every time
