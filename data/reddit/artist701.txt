Sorry. Here you go. NO CONVERSION FEES.
Bought $1 and got the whole $1 in BTC :O
Here's the result:

Really? Seems to work fine for me.

Here’s my quick screen shot for those interested. [I have 0 cause I transfer it all out usually. :)]( 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:39:45
That is the correct response. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:42:35
may be rolling out slowly it seems
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:05:51
Glad u said that. I actually had a bit of trouble myself. But after about a minute of steady hands, it all worked out. Scanner needs some work.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:26:58
The square cash app yes 
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:42:10
I've had the app for some time. Did a minor update 3 days ago or so but i think it's at the Account level since i didn't see the info. until today.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:27:30
Correct. Buying and Selling.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:11:54
[here u go :)](

Other noteworthy items:
I noticed I can only buy if i have money on my Square Cash Account, this means i need to transfer to my Cash account first. I can enable withdrawals but requires Verification via ID or Driver's License or State ID. Plus all info is encrypted and never shared (according to the disclaimer).
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:34:23
Yes! U click on the option atop. (Where the cash balance is at) u will see “Cash or BTC” than go from there.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:51:49
Maybe it’s rolling out slowly?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:22:27
It’s direct actually. I can’t purchase unless I have funds in my card. Meaning I need to upload some cash from bank (which is immediate and free) and than purchase. Almost instantly. Pretty nifty.
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:10:52
No Conversion Fees it seems :O
$1 for $1-worth-btc at their Exchange Rate:
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:55:13
It actually is. I can use it now. - [here’s the proof ]( 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:31:36
Not ignorant. It’s fair if u haven’t used the system. There is a “add cash” option if u ordered the Cash App card (black visa debit card that’s free). U than add some funds to that card with their 1-click option (as long as it’s linked to ur bank account) .
Than u just buy now (bitcoin) as the system by default will use that account. No way around it.

Yea I was skeptical based off the last statement personally. I like freedom and not fond of having a review process decide whether or not I want my money stored offline. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:32:34
That’s what I hear. Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:57
Some-one? It may be plural.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:56:10
Wow that’s great info. Thanks for that. Sounds like a sound plan.

I hear vault insures. If I get an offline wallet, and someone robs me, than I lose it all.

God I love this video! Still don’t understand a single word.
