Wow, this is incredible.
@_date: 2016-06-05 02:41:24
I second this. Try LibertyX.
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:06:27
Correct. The  site obviously raised some red flags.
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:37:18
Yes, don't forget the ladies.

I'm curious as to why they had to provide you a letter previously. Did your bank question the $5,000 deposit?
As for closing your account, that's how it goes with them sometimes. I think it's best to have a corporate account with them, as I think the scrutiny might be less for large transactions.

What was the website?
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:56:51
I have the same question. Feels like we're ripe for a dump.

It's a competitor to LocalBitcoins (peer-to-peer) but it's mostly scammers to be honest with you or people whose prices are ridiculously high.

Check out the Bitcoin Markets subreddit.
@_date: 2017-07-05 07:14:28
Use the Coinbase exchange- GDAX - very low fees.
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:18:05
How did you get instant buy via bank account? I thought it was only available for debit cards. Are you in Europe or the US?
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:04:05
That's awful. I'll never use the site.
@_date: 2017-07-08 04:42:19
What wallet is this?
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:08:53
Point taken, but I think it gives us something to aspire to TBH.
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:00:13
Buy after August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:26:57
Try Gemini.

Dude, I'm already there. I didn't have his email address, so I'm PM'd his Twitter friend ( and told him I could cut him in (or donate to charity or what have you) if he posed with the shirt. Of course I would send him the shirt for free. Haven't heard back yet though.
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:40:55
I wonder if they'll add alts. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:22:02
Yeah, I see your point but Bitcoin to the  moon had a nicer ring to it. :)

FYI, with Amazon Merch the seller doesn't see your information, only Amazon does because they print and ship the order. So no worries on that front.
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:13:17
Coinbase is OTC (higher fees) and GDAX is the Coinbase exchange where you're buying/selling to other traders.
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:11:48
Localbitcoins is the closest, but they don't sell alts and you have to meet in person or give out your bank account number, etc.

If you don't want to put 30 bucks up, you may not be ready for crypto. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:28:55
How cheap is the electricity? Are you in the US?
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:56:45
Upvoted, but feel compelled to link to the obligatory Neo/Morpheus meme. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 01:45:32
As opposed to Linux?
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:06:27
The future is now. That amount is 23 satoshis.
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:39:13
Did you ever get your BTC?
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:49:05
Build your own.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:00:51
What is going on over there? Is it a fractional reserve or what?
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:06:29
The ISO for Bitcoin is BTC by the way. :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:05:23
You might not want to move the market and all the exchanges have limits. That is what OTC orders are for in crypto. But if you believe that you can send Bitstamp $1 million and just buy off the exchange, then of course, go ahead and do it.
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:58:59
Check with your credit card company. They use a U.K. payment processor and the purchase can trigger a suspicious transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:29:08
Interesting concept. I wonder about vulnerabilities to DDoS attacks and scam coins who would connect to this unified block chain to steal/wreak havoc. There is a centralization issue and FinCen, the SEC, regulators in general.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:54:05
You place an OTC order off exchange. You contact the major exchanges plus Cumberland Mining, Genesis Trading, etc.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:00:49
You're right. Took a closer look. But they are having a problem with withdrawals. So glad I moved to Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:00:37
What's happening on August 1st?
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:50:51
Upvoted, but honestly I doubt it will happen considering where AML regulation seems to be going it will get harder and harder to buy.
