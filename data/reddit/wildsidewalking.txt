Sorry but you've been told a bit of propaganda about the national debt. First off, as a percentage of the GDP over the time that GDP has been tracked in the US.
Take a look at that graph. It's not that big a deal. Was the United States in a dire situation economically after World War 2? Nope, we were the strongest economic power in the world at the time. It's really irrelevant what our national debt is overall precisely BECAUSE we use a fiat currency. Can't pay for shit? Print more money. But be careful not to print too much because that will increase the inflation rate beyond the typical 2-3%.
What the fed usually does is print money in alignment with the economic climate to keep a steady inflation rate.
You see a figure like how big the national debt is to GDP, and you just assume it's bad.

Check out these episodes, and then listen to the rest of their episodes in general. Great podcast.

Most people wouldn't consider huge inflation "outperforming" if your goods and services prices were influenced by it. Thankfully Bitcoin is still largely insignificant as a driving force on the market. However, if you people get your wish and it's actually taken seriously as a form of currency, there will be less price stability than before. At least that's just my prediction.

Why? Fiat currency is incredibly stable in the long run and very boom-bust resistant.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:05:29
Fiat as a currency is superior still. It's more stable in the long-term. The whole reason we dropped the gold standard (which is what bitcoin is, a standard) was it made the US a target for market manipulation by other major powers. Foreign countries could shake our financial stability whenever they wanted to under the gold standard. Fiat is extremely stable by comparison. Market tanks? Print more money. Let it even out.
In the Bitcoin world we just saw a change from around 20,000 dollars to 13,000 dollars in the short term. If people actually had to buy milk and bread for their families with this currency, that dramatic of a shift could devastate them. Companies selling goods usually are slower to drop prices due to defalation and would often increase prices more quickly with an upper-end buffer in response to inflation. See gas station prices as a good example of that.
I like that bitcoin is an investment opportunity, but it is not stable enough to replace fiat currency.

It's 1/36th the size of all currencies combined.
It's not that small. All currencies are competing with each other, and Bitcoin is larger than most foreign currencies.
I think you are grasping at straws to say that it's super special in some way and shouldn't be looked at in the same way other currencies are.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:15:26
Only so far as the security of transactions. As far as how it behaves in economic systems, it's just a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:30:03
$257 billion dollars isn't some small market cap or anything. It's as large or larger than most foreign currencies.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:15:28
Production ready to the real world is it being able to be feasibly used as currency. The Bitcoin team certainly could have controlled inflation getting out of hand.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:23:10
I don't need to understand the fiat system to use the currency and "invest" in it. I just work my job, I get paid money, I invest in a target date fund for my 401k (I personally don't, I handle my own portfolio with 32% bonds, 48% large cap, 20% international stocks), etc... You don't have to think about it.
With bitcoin I would have to be super secure with my wallet, find places to do conversions, and is any job going to ever pay me in bitcoin with how incredibly unstable it is?
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:49:39
Soryr I didn't mean fiat currency is inherently superior, but it fixes the problems of the gold standard specifically. Obviously corruption and lack of regulations and standards are a huge problem in developing countries, irrespective of whether they use fiat currency or not. I'm not sure how bitcoin is the answer to that specifically since it's still very unstable and could make it so you can't eat one day and you are very well off the next. Why not just regulate and fight the corruption?

What happens to bitcoin if people stop trying to mine it or lose interest for example?

He makes like 600k a year from his blog, and has a diversified portfolio worth millions. He "retired" very young and wrote a blog about how to do it like he did. Your criticism isn't really accurate of his situation.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:25:20
Do you think it's realistic that people will stop using the US Dollar anytime soon? Whereas Bitcoin could face major scandals with online wallets, could get hit harder by regulation, could get taxed more, etc... All kinds of warfare could be waged against it even more than already has, which could impact its stability and people's desire to mine. I just think it's realistic to assume that bitcoin is very unstable when compared to fiat currency.

This has almost nothing to do with the national debt. This is related to laxing of regulations for employee protections, a changing landscape in the jobs market due to technological advancement, and a consistent sharp decline in the corporate tax rate and rich income bracket tax rate over the past 6 decades now. Wealth inequality in itself wouldn't be such a bad thing if the rich were taxed proportionately and businesses were regulated enough to bring up the lower and middle class with benefits. Capitalism sucks right now in the US because we have been deregulating for decades over and over, so it's getting worse. Capitalism works fine when it's heavily regulated.
I'm considered around the 40th percentile of earners in my age group at $35k per year salary. Back in 1990, 35k was $18,000 dollars or so. That's kinda nuts because people my age were making a LOT more, were more likely to have pensions, money in their 401k or an IRA, more likely to have healthcare provided by their job, etc... The money didn't trickle down, and it never does. Houses were cheaper in comparison to inflation, college was cheaper, etc... At least food as not rose with inflation, but it might soon when Trump kicks out all the immigrants.
Gotta say, the real reason we don't have equality is that we've done too much to protect the top-earners and nothing to protect the people who are doing all the work generating all their wealth.

Compared to swiping my credit card and paying it down with money I earn at my job, it's not production ready yet.

Yeah and when racists use the milk emoji over and over, it has nothing to do with racial purity, they just like milk because it's not literally a racial purity symbol, it's just milk. Ok.

I was one of the first to comment on his facebook post about the article. He's a local to my town and well known in the area... Here was my take...

It's not a payment system right now. It's like investing in penny stocks or in gold right now.

4% withdrawal reliably, so it's more like you would have 20k per year to live off of if you had 500k and wanted to live off of it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:22:23
Well it's not a direct comparison. I'm talking about how investors should treat it as an investment. It's not really comparable to modern currencies because it's not stable and hard to use as a legit currency.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:25:49
These people that are against the fiat system don't understand why it was put in place in the first place and is now the standard in almost every single country in the world.
Stability. Before fiat we used the gold standard which saw booms and busts on the order of 10-20% inflation and deflation year to year sometimes. After, we have a steady 2-3% inflation rate, and rarely do we ever see deflation, and if we do it's around 2%. This kind of stability makes all of our lives much easier.
Crypto doesn't have this kind of stability since it matches up more cleanly as a currency with something like the gold standard than fiat.
It's a finite resource.

Money laundering is the biggest one personally. The industry has to regulate itself somewhat so they don't have to deal with the headache of the courts coming after them. You can't knowingly allow major large-scale illegal shit to take place on your platform, you have to at least attempt to stifle it.

Account for your taxes, don't forget. Capital gains tax will be pretty significant on this.

If you have enough where it would crush you to try and pay it off reactionarily if the IRS said you got something wrong... just give it to a professional to handle.
So basically if you get like 500,000 dollars from cashing out... It could cost you like 25% in taxes. So can you reactionarily drop 30,000-50,000 in taxes that you didn't think of? Well maybe you should get a pro to take a look at it.
