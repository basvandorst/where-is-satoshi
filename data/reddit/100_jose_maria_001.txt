LMAO. As a newcomer to the space (2 years or so), I just wanted to say I really appreciate these kinds of history nuggets.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:45:50
haha, yeah, people don't expect geographers to talk about economic policy. But ironically that's where many academics who wanted to do critical research ended up, because the traditional disciplines are rather sanitized. Just like the fed works for the banks, so do the economic departments in the country.

I haven't tried it myself, but this explains the process

True! I just thought the article discussed the current capabilities and limitations of Bitcoin for international aid in quite a lot of detail, so I found it interesting.

I wish could! Would have to learn coding, haha. Maybe will take that on someday. But I'll definitely try to contribute feedback productively as an end user. (meaning, without complaining as did here...)

Just replying to some comments and providing some details:
* This operation is in the city of Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego Province. It is one of the closest, if not the closest human settlement to Antarctica. It gets pretty cold. 
* They have 1200 units of whatever equipment they use to mine; the model is not specified. The only employ 2 people on their staff. 
* They mine Bitcoin mostly, but depending on price and market conditions, sometimes they mine Ethereum or Monero.
* They mention that electricity is expensive in Argentina, so the risk for investors is high: The guy with glasses says his adrenaline pumps every time the price of Bitcoin goes parabolic, up or down. 
It takes some guts to invest in any business in Argentina, tbh. These guys must really be believers.

This needs way more upvotes!

Definitely. Been studying the subject for the last 2 years. I don't have much programming knowledge though.   
Aside from Bitcoin itself, I am mostly fascinated by the future applications that might become possible, for example, safe, unhackable electronic voting systems. A friend of mine who works in real estate, when she finally realized the potential applications, got really excited about some kind of records...I don't recall what she said, haha.   
But the point is that almost everyone who understand how Bitcoin and the blockchain work, get excited about something other than Bitcoin. I think that is a good test of how well someone understands the technology.

It was not your fault!

I am not from the U.S., but I heard that the IRS had asked Coinbase for records of all transactions over 20k? So I would assume if your net transactions are on the low thousands, you should be fairly safe, because I don't think they have the capacity to audit every person.
Which is why, if you can spread your transaction across multiple exchanges from different countries... then even harder to track. Not that I recommend anyone trying tax evasion, specially with the IRS, they are mob-like scary. 
But I wonder, how many people with low transaction amounts, are not paying taxes simply because it is so complicated, and you would need to hire an accountant, etc.

The commentator is silly...the federal government doesn't have a monopoly on printing money. That power was given to private bankers. So when Trump says Bitcoin is a threat to national security, it is the bankers saying through their slave and mouthpiece: Bitcoin will undermine our power.

Quality content LOL. Who made this and how long did it take?

I couldn't even convince my brother (22) and best friend (26) to download a wallet app on their phone to send them free bitcoin. Sigh...I understand your frustration. 
Your best bet is to not push the issue, and not take it personally. Just let it come naturally, if at all. Most probably, by the time they get it, it will be because bitcoin really takes off, and it would be too late by then anyways. But they would still enjoy all the benefits of bitcoin, just not the price boom.

Argentina, 60%, LMAO

I can't compare because I didnt know of crypto 3 years back, but I feel it is usable at this point. If u hold it to the standard of using Bisq as your primary exchange, it definitely falls short. But it will be my go to place for small transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-16 14:00:35
Perhaps it is pointing towards a notion that I heard Andreas say about Bitcoin: that decentralized systems have higher rates of innovation, because there are more people working on the central problems of our times, with the best ideas being adopted. If you keep reading down the page, the soviet bureaucrat is talking about how the USSR was unable to solve bread supply/logistics problems. So...in that way, capitalism's private business ventures meant only the most successful ones survived, and that competition spurred innovations that a centralized state apparatus was unable to reproduce efficiently. There were still areas where the soviets did better, but overall, they were left behind.   
But, I wonder if this is applicable across the board. I mean, the internet began as a military project, not only highly centralized, but also highly secretive. So, go figure.

Really good point. A few other commenters also pointed this out, I suppose the seller knows what he is doing more so than I did. Been a good learning exp.
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:11:01
Love reading stories like these. I specially admire how you communicated with your wife, and respected her choice. I also love how you explained how many investment venues available to working class people (house, savings) don't really yield anymore, and make no sense from a financial standpoint. If I had enough equity, I would do the same thing. Your approach, logic and risk taking are all solid; it doesn't guarantee success, because the future of Bitcoin is not entirely in our hands, but... everyday, it becomes more plausible.
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:16:41
I'll be sending this to friends and family! Very lucid primer for beginners.   
Suggestion: if possible, include a bit about transaction fees. A common question is whether miners will continue supporting the network after all bitcoins are mined, so it would be helpful. But overall, it is great as is.
@_date: 2019-07-18 05:56:16
I don't think I understand it better that you already do, but maybe this helps?
@_date: 2019-07-16 08:55:24
wow! such a detailed answer. It really helps with clearing my head space, and stop comparing the centralized exchange experience with Bisq's. I should be in awe that this is even possible, and know that it is still in early stages.
Yes, I have his phone number! Didn't think to contact the seller, will def. do so before involving an arbitrator.
Much appreciated

I agree, I guess there are some compromises needed to maintain the integrity of the system.

This is exactly what I thought when I heard AOC's comments. If you watch her whole 5 minute segment, you will see that she compares the government's money as a "public good," with FB's Libra as undemocratic and corporate controlled.   
She is trying to do good, but to still believe public institutions are public, or that elected officials control the monetary supply.... sigh. This just goes to show that so many progressives understand social policy... but not much about economics. I can imagine the bankers sitting back and laughing at our cluelessness.
And it is not anyone's fault: these things are not taught in economics departments across the country. Before learning about Bitcoin, I still thought the FED was in charge of issuing money, and I have a degree in economics!
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:01:38
Yeah, i guess this is why in some countries like Taiwan they banned BTC ATMs, to control on ramps...
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:05:08
It is hard enough to maintain privacy online, I imagine it is an order of magnitude harder to do so on the dedicated surveillance machines we call smartphones. For example, so many apps have hidden code that spy or syphoon data away, so it is hard to work from an generally uncompromised position. Bisq on Android would be like, manufacturing ice cream inside an active volcano...technically not impossible I guess. But who knows, I am no expert.

I remember being that age, and even back then I knew how unique it was being able to risk it all without losing sleep. When you have bright prospects, family support networks, and ur whole life ahead, it make all the sense in the world to take a gamble. I'd say go for it.

And on top of it, it's not like the book references the source of the quote either, so unless this can be verified, I would take it with a grain of salt.

Good stuff. I spent years in college and grad shool studying economics, and nobody ever taught us the implications of private banks having the power of money creation, which they call the factional reserve system. I am learning way more by reading posts here. Just goes to show why so many people are so unaware of what is causing the problems on a concrete level. They know its the banks, but not necessarily the mechanisms by which they are being priced out of their own cities, their purchasing power eroded, etc.

It means that interest rates have to remain lower than growth rate, or else the servicing of the debt (repaying the interest, not the principal) alone will be crippling.
