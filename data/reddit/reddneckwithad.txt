Was in ensenada about a year ago, a churro went for 15-30 pesos(dunno what that is in American, like maybe 1.50$?), depending where you got it. Im genuinely curious how this works, with the fees and transaction speed being what they are. Also, if you took this pic, can i ask where in ensenada this was? :)

I think, in this case, its less a matter of returns and more of supporting a currency you believe in.  You may only be in crypto for profit, but many of us genuinely believe in possible social/economic change
Im not saying either side is correct, just that there are two completely different kinds of people on this subreddit, and you just happen to not be the kind of person for whom such a sentiment was meant

Umm, did anyone else look at the fee theyre complaining about? Maybe im getting it wrong, but the math adds up to almost 37,000 sat/b on the minimal transaction
Can anyone explain why they set it that high? The current median fee is 226/b, and the current minimal fastest fee is 950 sat/b. I understand that there may have been urgency, but for the life of me i dont understand how it happened that they paid nearly 37x the current fee to be included in the next block

Well yes, but they clearly specified the fee they paid at first, the fee they paid after, and the bytes the transaction had
It does add up to 37x todays price to get in the next coming block after taking into account the byte size of their tx, which is why im asking about the reasoning behind it

Its great how straightforward, rational and unbiased he was in this. Respectable man by all standards

Just wanted to say thank you for all the good info, you guys do an amazing job of explaining things

Thats a good point actually. I was thinking more that the main benefit would be the constant evolution of BTC, which supposedly is what every fork is meant to accomplish
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:03:19
Im sorry, but im also confused; what happens to the bitcoins ive been holding when the fork hits?
I heard something about coinbase being a bad place to keep them, should i move them elsewhere before the fork?

Hey, if every one of those splits effectively leaves me with more coins AND is good for the longterm survivability of BTC then i cant complain
Hell, make the hard forks monthly, BTC will just grow stronger from them
