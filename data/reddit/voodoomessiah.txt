Start with your basis for Bitcoin. Do you have that? Now, did BTC appreciat in value when you made the trade? Or did you buy the LTC immediately after getting the BTC?

[Here's a idea from Twitter](
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:00:31
I think Bitcoin will be the critical factor in saving the current fiat system, and will lead to long-term economic stability.
@_date: 2019-11-13 13:47:05


This is literally every economy in the world pal.

I would add Hayek's 'Denationalisation of Money' to the reading list. He speaks about private money vs. central bank fiat. 
Summary: Central Banks are addicted to inflation, inflation is bad because it debases the currency, thus the currency is not 'sound money.'
 Private competition among currencies would result in sound money. Think about it. Letting the market decide which currency is best, just like any other good! Turns out we like assets that appreciate in value. Crypto is on the radar of anyone who is serious about finance and economics, because Bitcoin is the first private currency anyone alive today has ever seen.

Your stated use case for Bitcoin applies to any crypto.  Is it good for anything else besides sending money?

Wow you made an account just to smear Soros?

 No mate, that's delusional at this point. I buy BTC, but I could never advise elderly to buy BTC over bonds. I see the excitement and potential, not not when life savings are on the line.

This is not the place for a discussion of Bitcoin miner economics.
1. Almost nobody understands it here
2. Nobody here would give you an honest answer if it was bad news.

Custodial service - *any business entity that holds its customer's investment assets for protection.*
Do you see why an institutional investor would need this to get onboard?

Every time a fiat currency dies - private currencies like Bitcoin and Ether win. Why 'save' with the Euro and lose? You can use Ether to buy a stablecoin... any one, let's go with DAI for now. You can then lend DAI and get 8% on Compound. Your money is safely pegged to the dollar and generating interest income: backed by collateral and withdrawable whenever you desire. 
It's a free market for money thanks to Satoshi. Good money is chasing out bad. Central bank fiat is withering under private competition. This is an awesome time to be alive.

I think I will take some profit right before the fork.

The cost of labor is becoming higher than the marginal revenue it produces. That means that soon,  firms are more likely to fire than hire.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:37:56
Without some sort of price correction, I would be concerned that the valuation is incorrect. In other words, nonstop growth with no real decrease lends to the 'bubble' idea.

Hence the reason we don't want deflation in any form.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:51:25
Can you provide some insight into that idea? I'm curious why you think so.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:05:51
Or a loss of faith after multiple hard forks.

Unemployment is down, and wages are up. The last step before a correction.

When America was on the gold standard, borrowers begged for inflation. Otherwise taking a loan was painful as repayment cost you more and more over time. You all have forgotten that lesson. There is need for both inflationary and deflationary currency.

Zerohedge is a known Kremlin disinformation front. On top of that, specific Bitcoin wallets have been targeted for sanctions. The feds can and will find you. Transactions are neither anonymous nor untraceable.

I can't link my USAA account properly, even though they are partnered up. USAA tech support can't figure it out, and Coinbase won't repsond.

Mutual funds and pensions are only allowed certain 'good' investments. Bonds are good regardless of yield. Crypto is bad in this sense. Most investors don't have a choice but to gobble up this worthless government fiat.
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:06:31
I just think that a bear market would slaughter crypto. But let's see. I hold a ton because there is always a chance that a recession would benefit crypto, as spurned bond/equity investors look for anything that's non-correlated to the stock market or has a real yield. We'll see soon enough.

It's preferable than their local currency, which will hyper-inflate after the promised debt default.

Central banks claim 'no inflation' as an excuse to interfere in the market and endlessly pump asset values. The free market is dead.
