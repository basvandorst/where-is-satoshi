Good point, thanks for sharing that! I tend to overlook software wallets in favor of hardware, but that's purely a bias on my part, and there's certainly software solutions that are absolutely comparable to hardware.
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:56:53
It depends on if you want a software wallet or a hardware wallet. For software, I would recommend Breadwallet, Copay, or Mycelium (only the Android version). For hardware, check out Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey, OpenDime, Piper, or Case Wallet.

Yeah, they're definitely priced as collectibles.

It's a point I was thinking of as well - In fact, I was quite concerned how they had my email and name, and the mailing list seems to be the most logical answer. It seems that the most critical issue is shutting down the scam, but Trezor should also follow-up with information on the potential breech.

You are probably checking your bitcoin receiving address because when you store bitcoins on coinbase, you don't have a private key or really control any bitcoin (it's just a number on the UI until you transfer it out to your own wallet). See

One possibility is that you did not set a high enough transaction fee, causing the tx to stay in the mempool and not be confirmed immediately. In this case, it should get confirmed eventually. A tx ID would help in understanding the issue.

This is because Coinbase is providing the merchant services (i.e. the bitcoin addresses) and facilitates the transfer. In order to sign up for  a merchant account with Coinbase, one must provide business and personal information - information that could assist in an investigation of merchant fraud. They could also shut down any merchants suspected of fraud or other improprieties. You are right though, in the case the transaction occurs solely through bitcoin and not a third party.

Only one option in my opinion, Piper Wallet! It's definitely the best (and only) all-in-one paper wallet generator and printer.

Ask 21.co nicely and you may just receive! The 21BC is usually $399, but I'm sure they give out generous student/birthday discounts. Don't quote me on this, but I wouldn't be surprised if they give them out for free to the right people. If not, no worries they are coming out with the software libraries for free so you could just buy a basic RaspPi setup and work from there (minus the mining capabilities).

Which wallet do you use? It's definitely possible that yours doesn't allow you to set manual fees. That's not a bad thing so long as it has proper dynamic fees that account for the constantly changing demand in the market. Otherwise you end up in your situation where your transactions don't confirm right away. Basically, you're waiting for enough space to include your tx while others that paid higher fees are given priority and included.

@_date: 2016-04-22 05:51:11
That will happen in 2140 so it's not our problem. Miner's also receive fees from transactions so that will help offset the lack of block rewards. Bitcoins are basically infinitely divisible so it can be programmed to use smaller decimal amounts (in other words, you never run out of bitcoin, it just gains greater value and you use less of it). Being in possession of bitcoin gives you two things: 1) a store of value (hedge) against traditional fiat currencies that are subject to inflation, devaluation, capital controls, political stability, etc. and 2) a number of entries into the blockchain with guaranteed confirmation.

Okay, let's start with the title, which clearly refers to Bitcoin but uses Blockchain because, well, bitcoin bad blockchain good. Next, the key hurdles, which to be fair, is at least somewhat comprehensive. Add the unnecessary icons to the right of that. Now, without reason, group them into 4 obvious categories and call one of them cooperation instead of the usual 'Social'. Basically, the checkmarks (and the whole chart) is entirely useless. It may as well just be a one-column list of hurdles, unless you really care that cooperation has 7 checkmarks and economics has 5. It's a chart that is designed to look meaningful, but in actuality is quite pointless.

I'd get a second opinion with the gents over on BitcoinTalk (Collectibles), but I would reckon it would be priced around there, possibly $800 or $900 with light tarnish.

You're right, but physical coins will always carry an extra expense and an additional investment which can potentially generate larger returns.

I disagree. The micro-SD card is read-only to help prevent corruption, but there are still chances for problems to occur. Since it is read-only and customized per unit, it is actually easier to ship a new one.

You could load a bunch of paper wallets (using a Piper Wallet Printer, etc.) and pass that around. A bit more expensive would be the OpenDime or a physical bitcoin. Other than that, I'm not sure since all the current mobile apps would require internet to broadcast the Tx.

That's definitely a solid choice in my opinion, but others would vehemently disagree since it would lie inside a bank's vault (make of that what you will).

No, that would not be good for cold storage. If you used a wallet app, it would still have you write down the seed in case the device was lost, stops working, etc. If you just loaded a private key onto it directly, you wouldn't have any way of retrieving it if anything went wrong with the device. Cold storage really involves either paper wallets or preferably engraved steel (i.e. CryptoSteel), and these can be further secured by using Shamir's Secret and physical security (safe box) and/or geographic dispersal.

It's two-sided with 12 words on each, but you don't write down the whole word, just four letters. It's nice because it's an extra security measure (in addition to the optional 25th word), but it's still easy to remember with the first 4 (you could also brute force it if you forget).
You just need the mnemonic version for the Trezor backup seed, the "any key" provides some more letters and numbers if you want to write down a full private key and use it that way.

Sounds to me that you are looking at the balance of a given address, but the "change" that resulted after your tx is now in a new address (the "change address"). If that is the case, you still have the Bitcoin, you just aren't looking in the right place. An easy way to verify, albeit at the cost of privacy, is by checking the balance with the xpub (this gives the address explorer access to ALL of your public keys).

Absolutely. They are more likely to say "freezed" than "seized", but the latter is absolutely possible. Keep in mind, this is the case for nearly all traditional assets - Home, Bank Account, etc. 
This is why it is said "If you control the keys, it is your Bitcoin. If you don't control the keys, it is not your Bitcoin."

If you are a U.S. citizen, pretty sure you can only do FIFO or LIFO. FIFO is standard. The other ones, I believe called "specific identification", require some sort of application or what not. 
Long story short, stick with FIFO or LIFO, probably FIFO. Not a lawyer or CPA though, so I always stick to what is easiest. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:22:47
Yes that is correct. Not a CPA, but mining is considered as income, and exactly, you need to amend that 2011-2012 tax returns to account for that. But, keep in mind the bitcoin price then was way lower - so the income tax you will pay for that is based on the price of bitcoin at the time you mined it in 2011-2012. Basically, the income tax from the mining activity will pale in comparison to the capital gains on the 200 BTC sold.

Patience my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:36:44
Damned if you do, damned if you don't...but my advice is try to sell as little as possible until BTC is back to 19,000 again. It WILL get there again eventually. Otherwise, you are going to take a huge loss now, and then once it goes way above 19k you'll be kicking yourself again because you could've made money instead of losing it.
This is why you should never over-extend yourself. The key is to have enough liquidity elsewhere so that you don't need to liquidate your positions at a loss in a down market.
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:11:55

Well, it is a bit pricey, but I think I'd recommend the Ledger Blue given that you don't have a PC. I think the Blue may be the only device right now that allows for setup without any other machine (PC). 
I am not certain how it would work with an OTG cable, but I'd imagine it would be the exact same as the Ledger Nano/Nano S. Those latter two work flawlessly, so I imagine the Blue would as well.
Edit: PS, The Ledger guys may still have some "Coinbells Collectibles". These are sealed cans of Bitcoin goodies, and one of them (forget the name) includes a pre-generated Ledger Nano....It's not ideal to have it pre-generated, but they are certainly respectable devs, and so if you cannot afford a Ledger Blue, it may be an option to buy a pre-generated Nano from them in the Coinbells Can (looks like a Campbell's soup can, it's pretty cool).
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:49:08
Just saw it today, thought it was worth the crosspost. I believe someone just posted here today that their account of 10+ years at Chase got closed down from doing a Coinbase transaction.

You should check out bitcoin.tax - it is free for the standard version, or $20 per year for premium. You can import all of your own transaction history etc into it, and it will spit out a Form 8949 for your CPA, in addition to calculating the cost-basis, etc.

Where can you buy these?
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:02:54
Simple. Download Bread ( Go through the usual process, but then click on "Settings" and then "Import Wallet". Then simply peel the coin and scan the QR. There are different formats for things like this, so if it doesn't work, check back and I can re-advise, but this should do it.
That said, I would be more than happy to buy it at a small premium if you can take a pic of the coin, and we can figure out some sort of agreeable escrow.

Thank you, glad I can help. Actually, read a quote earlier today that is perfectly related, "If you look at all the great investors that are as different as Warren Buffet, Carl Icahn, Ken Langone, they tend to be very very concentrated bets. They see something, they bet it, and they bet the ranch on it. And that's kind of the way my philosophy evolved, which was if you see something that really, really excites you...The mistake I'd say 98% of money managers and individuals make is they feel like they got to be playing in a bunch of stuff. And if you really see it, put all your eggs in one basket and then watch the basket very carefully." - Stanley Druckenmiller

It's a maturation of the community. Both good and bad. The wild west days are over. The small, tight-knit bunch, is expanding and the connections get less personal. It's harder to generalize the community, but that also means that it is becoming more diversified in thinking. It's nothing to be down about. Very much expected. And, if you find the right niche / sub-community, you'll feel right at home again.

That sucks, but here's my advice: You want BTC? Go out and get it! 16 and no credit card are just obstacles. You can't buy BTC directly, no problem, you can still earn it. Do you create art? Sell it for BTC on bitcointalk.org. Do you have some used video games or other things that you wish would turn into BTC? Same thing applies. You can get creative, there are infinite ways to earn BTC besides purchasing it. Create an awesome youtube video and put in your BTC address. Convince your friends to start an investment group like Warren Buffet did - each put in $20-50 and have the coolest parent buy it for you to then split up into paper wallets. The list goes on and on. Feel free to reach out if you need any help getting started.

Think of it this way, $50 or $100 is either 1 video game + dlc or a nice date. You couldn't possibly go wrong spending it on a high-risk asset instead. In my opinion though, it may not be worth the time spent unless you are willing to continually invest more. A hardware wallet will set you back around $100, so even if Bitcoin has another 10x up to 100,000, you would only have $500-1000 (minus HW wallet etc).
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:36:22
Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, so it is going to take some patience. The value is going to fluctuate, so I encourage you hold on to your $150 worth and play the long game. If you trade too often, the fees will erode your growth, not to mention the tax implications. Play the slow game. Keep a close eye on your investment. And perhaps most importantly, keep your wallet secure (2FA, strong password, proper backups, etc.)

You can always find an OTC provider to transact larger trades. Genesis Trading has minimum of $75k per transaction and Cumberland Mining is a minimum of $100k per transaction.

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:22
Think about it this way though. Say you have 1 BTC at 17k with a cost basis of 1k. You sell and profit $16k. Now you pay taxes, and have 12k remaining. You need BTC to go below 12k in order to buy back in and be in the same position.
tl;dr - you aren't increasing your BTC wealth. The profit gained is a mirage, and you are back to crumbling traditional financial system. How much will inflation erode each year? What about after this next recession that has been building up?
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:21:40
Well, the transaction is mined into the blockchain, and that confirms that the coins now belong to the recipient address. There is no mechanism to go the reverse way. No central authority or government or anyone else that can force the coins back to the sender. So, in practice, if you need to refund a customer, you simply just craft a new transaction to send them the coins. 
tl;dr - sending a transaction is simply the reversal/chargeback method - but the key difference is this can never before forced.
Immutability is the valuable property of Bitcoin that means no one can go back and alter records (i.e. hide a transaction / reversal / falsely adding to a balance / etc.)

So full disclosure: I am the creator. 
We do not store private keys, period. In fact, one step further, we don’t monitor public keys, so we have no idea if/when it is funded and redeemed. 
These cards are intended for short term gift transfer, not long term cold storage. For security focused customers like yourself, we plan on launching an OpenDime edition. This will have less reliance on a trusted third party, but will cost significantly more due to the cost of goods. It’s a trade off between cost and security. Our current cards have, IMO, a perfect balance that ensures both security and affordability.
We generate keys on an offline airgapped machine, and the printing and assembly is done in-house. 
Hopefully this answers your questions, if not feel free to reach out at hello to continue the conversation.

The backlog is due to the block size limit. Only 1MB worth of transactions (max) can be inserted in each block which is found approx. every 10 minutes. This artificially imposed constraint creates a more lucrative fee market for miners and special interest groups, but also mitigates the risk of blockchain bloat that is a result of spam attacks. Therein lies the two sides of the ferocious debate. Increased block size would inevitably lead to greater centralization, but failure to do could cripple the network through higher fees and longer confirmation times.

* 1) Security. Buy a reputable hardware wallet...like yesterday.
* 2) Spending. Don't. Use as needed, but don't be wasteful...i.e. do you really need that video game / fancy watch / etc?
* 3) Hindsight Bias. Learn from your mistakes, and don't get caught up in what you should've done or how much you could've made.
* 4) Diversify. Don't. This is the advice of many, but does it really benefit you to invest in Butthole Coin, Grandma's ICO, etc. Be smart. BTC is a risky asset, and altcoins are even riskier.
* 5) Research. Stay on top of the game as much as you can. 24/7 if possible with Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, Slack, etc. The market conditions are always changing. If you try to be as educated as possible, you are less likely to get caught up in FUD. Seasoned investors do not care about CBOE/CME, nor did they panic about the fork.

I've only used Celery for a few purchases, but my experience with them has been great. If you want instant purchasing power (who doesn't), just email them and they will be happy to set you up with a $250 limit. I was told that this limit could again be raised after some time and a few purchases. Overall, it's a great service that will only get better.

Well, your assumption is based on the idea that speculation is the only thing holding up bitcoin which I would argue is false. There is plenty of utility in the blockchain. It would have never taken off in the first place if it didn't. As Satoshi said, "Not having Bitcoin would be the net waste".
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:12:53
Yeah, you got it! Just download Bitcoin-QT and get it synchronizing (takes some time, so just let it run), and open up the port forwarding on 8333. If you have UPnP, you might not even have to open up the port, it just depends on your router and settings. Once you have the node synchronized, you'll be able to see how many connections (incoming/outgoing) your node is making--if it is more than 8 you know that everything is working!
I am not the security expert, but I have yet to hear any horror stories about hackers/etc. so you should be fine. I've been running a node for several months without any problems.

Can you link to the financial statement? My guess is that the reason they are profit negative is that they are heavily investing in R&amp;D and other expenditures related to growth. It is important for 21e6 to make costly investments now in order to realize their full growth potential down the road. So don't worry too much that they aren't profitable at this point (it's the norm, not the exception).

I was thinking about making a mobile app for this purpose. For example, you could "drop" a bitcoin at a certain GPS location and then another person (such as your son) could open up the app and begin a scavenger hunt where the private key is unlocked as soon as the phone gets in a certain range of the original GPS coordinates.
That way you don't have to worry about burying anything, etc.

Isn't it already? Usually when the word 'blockchain' is used it is in reference or in comparison to Bitcoin's blockchain.

This is kind of a deal breaker for me. A warranty seems to be important for new tech products, especially if the payment is non-reversible and all international shipping costs fall on the customer. Get it down to $99 in v2 and I would be willing to take the risk.

The best part about people shorting bitcoin is in the short-term you know it will probably work, but in the long-run all these individuals will get squeezed out of the market and be left with the empty feeling of "why didn't I just hold!".

Well, as you know Bitcoin already has a lot of fraud prevention built within, so you don't have to worry about double spends or chargebacks. Depending on how much is being transacted, there should be 0-3 network confirmations before the transaction is considered complete. Using Coinbase, BitPay, Braintree, or other payment processors is certainly less risky than choosing to accept bitcoin by yourself.

Once merchants get on board, they will be able to offer the haggler in all of us an instant 5%+ discount for using Bitcoin, which really is a win-win for both parties. A discount for the consumer and a profit margin no smaller for the merchant. That's why I think if we can convince some merchants to get on board early tomorrow morning, then there is the potential to educate a number of consumers throughout the day!

Nice setup! I wish I had the Apple Watch to check the bitcoin price constantly, it would save me so much time. Even if I had the extra money to buy one, I couldn't help but think "That is like 2 BTC! Why don't I just use that money to buy more BTC." Certainly nothing against your purchase, but it is increasingly more difficult to buy technology products when you know it is going to be 10x better (or less expensive) in a year or two. And that planned obsolescence... I swear, bitcoin is going to create a nation of savers.

The default option is for the key to be held by Third Key Solution, but you also can choose to store the key yourself on something like Cryptosteel or a piece of paper. In that case, you would still control 2 of 3 keys and be all gravy. You're the expert though, so I'll definitely take your insight into consideration! Can't blame you for being paranoid, 3000 BTC yikes! Good lesson learned, on the bright side (if there is one). You'll make that back in no time with all of the cool products you come up with!

Yeah I think that is brilliant. The way I see it, it would just be a variant of the colored coins implementation--a satoshi or other fractional amount of Bitcoin would be considered the proof of DRM and from there it could be transferred (i.e. loaning a friend a DVD), etc.

The U.S. dollar is so strong right now. I think it would take either a falling dollar or another major economic event like Cyprus to launch Bitcoin to the moon.

I've only had positive experiences with GoCelery, but there's no doubt that they are a relatively new company that is still doing a lot of development. I know that they just recently changed some features related to instant purchasing so there's likely some bugs to be worked out.

A lot of it depends on how much it costs to integrate into your current system. If it is an insignificant amount, then why not accept it?
Consumer adoption is still chugging along, but business adoption (as a means of settling account payables) is still largely untouched. It makes sense because businesses don't have unused bitcoins laying around.
That said, you may receive some press for being one of the first supply chain businesses to accept bitcoin, and in that case, it would almost certainly be worth it.
This is the perfect time to pull out a CBA or NPV analysis and look at the numbers.

With the price they are charging for unloaded coins, it is basically a joke. Anyone could make the same exact thing themselves for less than half the cost.

Definitely check out Case Wallet. It is most likely the perfect device for your needs. It connects via 2G cellular towers (but is completely free), so it may be more connected than your ideal, but I would argue it is just as secure as using WiFi or Ethernet. It doesn't have a touchscreen, but has a built-in camera for scanning QR codes. Additionally, the software will be open-sourced before launch. Finally, it is the size of a credit card and easily fits into your pocket.

I am not a BTM owner, but let me give you my 2 cents anyways.
BTMs are generally not extremely profitable for two reasons:
1) BTMs have large fixed costs (Hardware, rent, and Internet) that are made up slowly over time through fees (this is why the fees are so large at BTMs).
2) There is a hidden cost of regulations and uncertainty (MSB license fees and new BitLicense regulations, etc.)
If you are skilled with navigating regulations and/or already have a MSB license, and live in a dense, urban area, then it is worth it to do further analysis. If you are a shop owner or don't have to worry about rent or internet expenses, then all the more reason to do it.

Based on that prototype, they have come a long way since that video. Nonetheless, I can't help but feel it is mostly vaporware.

While I can see the utility in doing this in the short-term, it is kind of ridiculous to take bitcoin and turn it into fiat on a credit card since you would not only be paying a conversion fee to do so, you would also pass on the 3-5% fee charged by the credit card to the merchant.

I think it has to do with negativity, trolls, and the relative lack of quality content. Now is still THE place for Bitcoin news in my opinion, but I am talking in relative terms. Also, there's more competition now. A lot of the upbeat, corporate folk left and went to ZapChain. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:19:28
Very true, but it is still a well crafted device. The fact that one key is stored with Third key Solutions, and the other two are generated via the device and fingerprint minutiae, makes it easy for the average joe to have a secure, international hot wallet. That said, the TREZOR/Cryptosteel combo is pretty hard to beat.

Is the move temporary or permanent? Are you/will you be a dual citizen? You should be fine in the short-term (i.e. just making a few transactions over the course of a few weeks/months you are there), but I'm less certain about long-term activity, especially if it is a country that Coinbase does not do business in.
@_date: 2016-03-24 15:06:45
There is no doubt in my mind that we will ALL receive our Cryptosteel. While it is an unfortunate situation, it certainly is possible that all 80+ parcels were either A) stolen in transit or B) held by customs somewhere along the way, especially considering unregistered economic mail was used. Either way, I completely trust Wojtek and the team (including the awesome people behind Trezor) and know that they will sort through this.
Compare Crypsoteel to Tixie, the bitcoin clock, who were completely UNRESPONSIVE and never attempted to return funds after their failed campaign despite saying so. Even consider The Coolest Cooler, the most funded Kickstarter in history, which still has not shipped to most of its backers and yet sells on Amazon. Wojtek responds to each and every comment on Indiegogo so as long as he continues providing updates and shows that progress is being made, then we don't have to worry.
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:50:04
I guess if you read between the lines. In my opinion, KeepKey is nothing more than an overpriced Trezor clone that has a slightly improved, larger display. Everything else is a scratch. It astonishes me how many reviews have come out that somehow justify the $239 price point with it's OG competitors Trezor ($129) and Ledger ($35). At some point the media needs to call it out for what it is and stop promoting it and similar copy-cat devices.
@_date: 2016-03-29 14:46:11
If you hold a significant amount (in my opinion anything greater than $100), then I HIGHLY recommend a Trezor or Ledger Nano. Both are top-notch hardware wallets with great developers/support. If you want ice cold storage check out Cryptosteel.

Okay, I respect this answer. My only question is whether the zero fees are sustainable? If that is part of the exchange's business model and it is, then I think it's fine. On the other hand, if it's merely an ongoing promotion that could end at any time, then it is much more likely that volume is being exploited in a harmful way.

@_date: 2016-06-22 22:52:41
You can read a bit more about it [here]( or [here]( Basically, while you don't *have* to include a transaction fee, you typically want to so that your transaction is confirmed within the first few blocks (10-30 minutes.) That usually works out to somewhere between $0.05-$0.15, depending on a few factors. You are right in that Coinbase will pay the TX fee for you to send (there is no fee for receiving), but it's not a service that is recommended for anonymity as they use coin tracking for AML/KYC (and general U.S. business) regulations.

I'm not a seasoned numismatist, but I don't think a few hairline scratches will take away from the value of the coin. It still has 1 BTC of uncirculated Bitcoin. You can find beat up Cadascius coins that still fetch quite a handsome premium.
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:11:56
Most (all) exchanges do not require you to purchase a whole bitcoin (~$600). Simply buy a fractional amount (i.e. .002 BTC = $1.2 USD)

In regards to owning a whole unit, I can see how psychologically this would be true. However, there has been talk for a while now about switching to "bits" (1 million bits = 1 BTC) in many UIs. In that way, people would still own "whole units". The funny thing is if you say you own 1 Bitcoin noobs might think you own 1 bit!
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:34:12
I would simply produce only funded notes -- problem solved! Unless of course you live in the U.S. or another jurisdiction where you don't want to do that. In that case, try to create a partnership with Denarium or another company in the space that is legally able to produce your note. All you'd have to do is sit back and collect that royalty check.

Yeah, absolutely, ever since I discovered Bitcoin I had a renewed interest in saving and holding long term investments, so I definitely agree. I know there are a lot of different perspectives, but personally I think it is a no-brainer to buy BTC basically at any price under $1000. If it can't get to 2013 Mt.

I'm sorry, but no there aren't. When you see the price of something rise from literally $0 to over $1000, then a drop from $770 to $590 doesn't make a blip on the radar.

I believe the multi-sig and vault are two separate products. The vault simply has a time-release (48 hours I believe) and the multi-sig is the 2 of 3 you described.

The only way to make money *immediately off buying it*  is by arbitraging the markets. The other way is to buy and 'hodl' (treat as an short/long-term investment which can produce gains or losses). The only practical means of acquiring bitcoin as an ordinary consumer is to buy it from exchanges since mining equipment is expensive and produces a low ROI per unit (i.e. you need a mining operation at large scale these days).

A lot depends on the condition of the coin! eBay has higher premiums for selling, but there is a big risk in chargeback fraud so be careful! Bitcointalk (Collectibles section) is a good place to start! And make sure you have clear pics, otherwise it is impossible to estimate the value.

Yeah true, it definitely does, but the lower the condition of the coin, the less so. What year is it? And Silver or Brass? A bottom of the barrel brass 2013 is probably in the 1.1-1.2 range. But even if you swept the BTC off of it, you could still get $200-300 for the blank. So you definitely lose value, but not nearly as much as if it is in good condition and a 2011 series 1 or a 2013 Silver, etc etc
Edit: I don't mean to be pitching to sweep it though - With the rarity and desirable to many collectors, Casascius coins are basically a museum piece.

Bitcoin is up 30% in the last week, I'm on vacation! :) In all seriousness though, it has been 500 years since bonds, the last new asset class, was invented. Who is crazy enough to invest money and time into a new asset class? Answer: early adopters (us!). Rogers' technology adoption life cycle model describes this diffusion of invention that influences the speed of adoption. Luckily, we are all on the left side of the bell curve, and that means we get to be some of the largest beneficiaries of the technology. We also get the front row seats to the popcorn drama that is inherent in any early project, especially one that is decentralized and open-source. Bitcoin must pass the test of time. The litmus test is 20,50,100 years from now. Success is succession.

I think you are right in that the 24th word is a checksum. I meant that one should enable the optional 25th word passphrase that essentially creates a hidden wallet (i.e. you need the 24 words to get into your unencrypted wallet, but the extra passphrase is required to access the encrypted wallet). You can even create multiple 25th words to have many different encrypted wallets that will all share the same 24 word backup seed.

Beware of flex funding campaigns on crowdfunding sites! You are never guaranteed a product. For example, Tixie was another smart Bitcoin clock marketed on Indiegogo, but the project failed to meet its goal and the creators ran off with the money (They actually stated they would issue refunds but never did and failed to respond to inquiries until they shut off their servers altogether). If you have already donated to TicrThing, contact the owners and make sure they will either A) fulfill your order even though they didn't reach their goal or B) issue immediate refund. Keep a watchful eye and if it appears it was a scam, contact your credit card company immediately. Indiegogo does not accept any responsibility.

I think this may be misleading because although this is how Coinbase reports it, services such as bitcoin.tax do not calculate it this way. Coinbase is just making a conservative assumption. With sufficient evidence, one can prove that the way bitcoin.tax calculates it is the correct way.

@_date: 2016-02-13 21:56:46
I certainly appreciate the attempt. Aside from the USD, I'd say it's probably not true that a country's currency is accepted everywhere in the sense that you would probably subject to conversion fees to the locally accepted currency. Cards are prone to unauthorized transactions through theft or fraud, while authorized transactions accumulate interest fees. The value fluctuates through FX like any currency, some rise/fall as dramatically as Bitcoin in turbulent times. You are still subject to capital gains no matter what currency you own (speaking to U.S legal jurisdiction of course). The only thing I cannot refutiate is your last point regarding cash purchases, however, digital currencies do offer enhanced protection for online purchase if you so choose to protect yourself.
@_date: 2016-02-25 22:55:00
A few points..
1) Actually, the volatility of BTC is only 2.16%/3.69% (30 and 60 day estimates, respectively). For comparison, the volatility of gold averages around 1.2%, while other major currencies average between 0.5% and 1.0%. While volatility is currently higher than these, the trend of stabilization continues.
More importantly:
2) The concept that wallet providers should be responsible for the price fluctuations in bitcoin IS completely ridiculously in situations where the user controls his/her bitcoin. Wallet = / = Bank.
3) It is probably easier (and safer) to move out of Wyoming than to do the "virwox workaround" you described.
@_date: 2016-09-01 00:22:26

The "raw number" of investments don't matter, it's the total that counts. Speaking of, the $119m in 21 inc. has no product yet, I wonder how long that will last?

Certainly not 100% stagnant, it's either gaining or losing at all times.

I utterly disagree. My view is that a large part of the blockchain's power comes from Metcalfe's Law and it will be increasingly difficult to find a substitute to Bitcoin with regards to network strength. The technology (i.e. blockchain) is inseparable from the currency (i.e. bitcoin), so it simply isn't feasible that the currency would go away. Rather, it might just take a backseat role compared to all of the other applications, and even that may be a stretch.

Does the BTM allow a user to sell their bitcoin to the machine and cash out to fiat? If so, then yes, it is a good investment. If not, I am not sure how useful a BTM is since it has no competitive advantage over an online exchange. The process is going to continue to get easier and BTMs won't be able to keep up because of fees (inherently more expensive because of hardware/rent involved). Essentially everyone's cell phone is a BTM if you have a credit/debit card.
In my opinion, BTMs try to apply the traditional banking paradigm to bitcoin, and in the long run, it just won't work. Even if it does, traditional ATMs will merely be upgraded to support bitcoin, increasing the competition for all the independent owners.

These are not myths. The rule of thumb is that small purchases up to $5-10 (or possibly more) can be completed with zero confirmations. Transaction fees are optional and paid by the buyer/sender. Remember this guide is in the point of view of the merchant. Thanks for your feedback.
@_date: 2015-04-06 05:17:28
Here's the thing though, even if you did purchase at $1200 or $1000 or whatever, you could've mitigated your mistake by selling at say $800 or $700 and then re-purchasing at $200-250, making your money back in no time.
Edit: Regarding your time, it is only wasted if you didn't extend your knowledge and give back to the community. If you did neither in those 2000 hours, then yes, you should feel a little bad.

Regarding monthly bandwidth caps, this is definitely a concern. Even if one has a computer with sufficient CPU/RAM/Storage, virtually no one has unlimited bandwidth.
It is easy to set up a QoS (Quality of Service) rule on one's router to limit the Upstream bandwidth. Currently, only 400 Kbps is the minimum requirement for Bitcoin Core. By setting the limit to 400+ Kbps, one can ensure that only a minimum amount of bandwidth will be expended and still contribute to the network.
Under this setting, most users' bandwidth limits will not be a concern.

At least you are throwing out ideas to the community though! Much better than a lot of people here just passively reading.

No, the problem isn't related to the Trezor device.
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:54:45
Pros: Disruptive technology, Very low fees, fast transfers, no minimums/limits, irreversible, pseudo-anonymous, mathematically secure, accessible to people worldwide (not subject to signup screenings, credit checks, etc.), limited/scarce, deflationary
Cons: irreversible, volatile, legal/regulatory uncertainty, few merchants accept it currently, bad reputation (association with silk road, etc.), deflationary
Some of the pros and cons overlap.

May I suggest that you create an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) and an NCA (non-compete agreement) so that you can tell others about your idea without the risk of them stealing your idea (if they do you could sue them to the moon).
Why is this worth it? Because your attorney won't be of any assistant in the actual development of your idea. An idea without action is worthless.
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:17:22
Truth. If one were to purchase Bitcoin last night at ~$253, then you would've already received a 2% gain (at the current price of ~$258), which is way better than any return cloud mining could get.
@_date: 2015-04-06 04:04:58
Just save up for a Trezor (and use the discount code 'mycelium.com' so that it is $99 if it is still valid). You won't regret it.

If you sell your coins at a prominent exchange such as Coinbase (or any other one that has a high volume of trades) and price your coins at the current fair market price, then you should be able to sell quite a few. The one caveat is that if you are selling a TON of bitcoin, you could actually drive down the price in doing so--essentially, you would have to sell your coins in multiple baskets, each time at a slightly lower cost (since you are literally moving the market). In either case though, you should be able to sell them nearly instantly.
@_date: 2015-04-03 19:45:38
Coinbase has excellent customer support and they will solve this issue for you if you reach out by email/live chat.
Occasionally Coinbase will flag and cancel transactions due to fraud detection (typically new accounts). However, if you contact them and state that you indeed created the transaction and it was valid, they will typically reinstate the order at the price you intended to pay. They DO NOT cancel orders due to price increases. They have no motivation to do so as they make their money based off of fees and ultimately, customer loyalty.
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:18:51
I am open to that idea. I like that Coinbase can provide instant liquidity into USD though.
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:30:08
Regarding your second question, I too believe that you should check out the Trezor Bitcoin Safe (Hardware Wallet). It is more than worth the $120 if you are going to hold anything greater than a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin.

I'm wondering if it isn't one of the problems you mentioned above, is it someone who registered for the hackathon who has an interest in limiting the number of people who know about the competition (Thus increasing the likelihood that they win)?
As messed up as that is, it is a possible concern.
@_date: 2015-04-07 05:36:29
Yes, so long as some level of the system hits the blockchain. For example, side-chain applications are pegged to bitcoin, so not all transactions are recorded to the blockchain, but the ones that are contribute to the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:42:28
Not working for me either
@_date: 2015-04-05 08:22:21
I disagree. Ex: BitPay. My point is that businesses get to hedge against volatility by immediately cashing out, so why don't consumers get to hedge against volatility by only purchasing bitcoin when necessary and transferring immediately? The fee structure eliminates the incentive to do this since the fees resulting from many small transactions over time would, in fact, be more costly than traditional systems.

@_date: 2015-04-05 09:01:12
I abbreviated my logic, but the switch affects consumer psychology and helps fix the perception that bitcoins are "too expensive". The bit notation encourages smaller purchases because it is more clear to consumers that you can purchase amounts like 1000 bits or 10 bits or 1 bit, than it is that you can purchase .000001 BTC (the intuition is to buy one whole unit or many whole units).
@_date: 2015-09-28 01:35:37

True, there would be also be a power supply ($5), a hard drive ($30), a case ($10), and labor costs, making the total cost of goods sold at least $100. However, the component price would drop dramatically if it was done at scale.
I guess I just think there needs to be more competition in this space. No one has really committed to bitcoin node hardware yet.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:09:14
If Coinbase ceases to exist, I'd venture to say that it is a good time to exit Bitcoin and purchase some gold. It is very unlikely that Coinbase will ever experience anything like Mt.Gox. Nearly zero chance.
I personally choose to take some extra risk and store my coins using a Trezor. However, my Coinbase account is still extremely useful for purchasing new coins and also as an emergency backup (i.e. I can transfer all of my coins from Trezor to Coinbase in a hurry using my backup seed if I lose the actual Trezor device).
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:55:28
Thank you!

Those comments are either born out of ignorance or, more likely, fear. Specifically, fear that bitcoin could eventually hurt the profits of companies like Charles Schwab and eliminate the jobs of employees like the one you had a discussion with. Not that either of these are justifiable excuses, but just try to see it from their point of view. Turbulent times to say the least.

What speaks volumes is that VC investment continues to grow. It has been 6 years since bitcoin's inception, but only 2 years since real investments were made. The comparison to HTTP is naive and inaccurate. Research on what would become the internet started in the 60s-70s and WWW wasn't created by Tim Berners-Lee until 1989.  Consider the dot-com bubble of the late 90s and compare the web of 2000 versus that of today.

In theory, it sounds great. The caveat is basically your second question: it will only work with participating providers. If Netki is aggressive and establishes partnerships with Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle, Xapo, and every other major wallet, ATM, exchange, and payment processor, then it will work great. 
If it doesn't work with everything, then it simply doesn't work at all. Imagine if URLs only worked with certain web browsers. Or if phone numbers only worked with certain connection lines or providers.

I would recommend selling through BitPay so that you could convert a certain percentage to cash immediately (to pay for the cost of the supplies, etc.), but keep a little bit in BTC (to perhaps make a nice profit if the price rises throughout the year, which it has so far).
I believe BitPay has no fees.

All great questions! Right now, we do NOT use YouTube Ads (or any ads for that matter) to monetize content. Rather, it is a combination of donations, paid memberships, and paid content (i.e. PopChest). Since we are brand new, we don't have specific numbers for creator earnings, but I can say that we operate transparently and creators split 60% of the profit (members 25%, administration 15%) and we've paid out about $30 so far. We also don't limit creators, so as long as the media tags are used, the creator is free to monetize on their own channel/etc. We merely help to subsidize creation. Since we have not yet started selling memberships (limited edition physical coins), this number is likely to increase substantially. We accept all different types of content, so long as it is not a direct paid promotion and it fits within the scope of Bitcoin (and soon any other open source project). Finally, memberships offer a few cool things: 1) the limited edition physical token itself (it receives distributions automatically so its value is always increasing) 2) dashboard access to Youtube/Google Analytics and a member only chat 3) early access to exclusive content 4) voting rights to make key organizational decisions 5) goodwill knowing you are supporting other creators.
Thank you for your time - We will certainly create a FAQ to clarify things for everyone else!

What's your early impression of the device?
@_date: 2015-03-16 05:21:46
Yeah, exactly. The private keys are generated on the device and never leave it. Trezor signs the transactions when plugged into a computer or Android phone. Even if the device is infected with malware/etc. it is completely safe to do transactions. As a backup, you write your 24-word seed (+1 password seed) on a separate piece of paper in the case you lose your device.
It is essentially a cold storage wallet with the added ability to do transactions that are safe from hackers/malware/etc. The key really is securing the backup seed since that is the point of failure if it gets lost or stolen. If just the Trezor is lost, you don't have to worry because it is protected by a pin code.

My experiences have been rather different. Several times I've actually had performers see me recording on my phone and they told me to post it to YouTube so they can find it.
Now imagine that performer had a QR sign. Not only could he be paid for his work from all of those people watching videos on YouTube, but maybe eventually he could actually search by his public address to find his own videos! 
How many times have you seen a video of some awesome street performer and wished you could contribute some bits? Not only that, but these videos can go viral (or do handsomely well) and the street performer might not even be aware of it!

Explain how that combines the problems of bitcoin and credit cards? It wouldn't at all be the same system. The device would merely sign the transaction making it unable to expose the private keys, unlike stealing a credit card number's magnetic stripe or whatever. As for none of the benefits..why not? A company could offers rewards for using bitcoin the same way as credit card companies do.

I have a few ideas that I want to prototype and develop mainly. I'm relatively new to python and bitcoin programming so a bundled device that came pre-installed and with support fit the bill for me. I'm hoping that 21's vision of a bitcoin-specific chip in nearly every electronic device comes to fruition. By then I should have acquired the skill-set and tools needed to deploy some of my projects. The device certainly comes at a premium, but I could not be happier with the hardware, software, and support so far.

It's hard to say since it really depends on your situation and investment preferences. I used to be a short-term (3-5 year) hobby stock trader (specifically hi-tech), but now I am a long-term (20-30 year) commodity/currency guy. My point is that for me, I would only consider purchasing BTC at this price level, but you could just as well day trade it and squeeze out much more profit in the near term. Of course, the flip-side is you could potentially take much more loss too.  It really boils down to: do you want to play more with systematic risk (long-term) or with volatility (short-term)?

In short, it doesn't HAVE to be bitcoin. However, history is on bitcoin's side. Consider Metcalfe's Law that states that "the value of a telecommunication network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system". 
In other words, Metcalfe's Law is the idea of "Network Effects". Since bitcoin was first, it has the greatest number of users. In fact, bitcoin growth continues to outpace that of any altcoin, likely because of this network effect.
Remember that the TCP/IP that comprise the internet that we know and love is not the most robust/secure protocols, they were merely the first to gain traction and create a powerful network effect that make it all but laughable to consider anything else than these protocols when discussing the web.

I am surprised that no one here has mentioned NFC yet. The hint at a "mass consumer play" is what makes me think that they are going for their own variant of a more secure Apply Pay. Could be a 'Coin' credit card-like device that acts as both a wallet and a way to interface with NFC at point-of-sale terminals. Or even just software that sits on Android phones with NFC (but they would have to figure out how to make it worthwhile for the iOS base to truly be a mass consumer play).

Your account has probably been flagged, likely due to AML/KYC (Anti-Money Laundering/Know your Customer) regulations. If you have a high transaction volume or are sending/receiving from questionable sources they have a legal obligation to get more information from you so that they can better determine if you are using Coinbase legitimately and to their TOS or not.
All you have to do is provide a few details and it will be removed. Totally worth it. They will stop cancelling your transactions.

I think it is unfair to say that it is "too expensive for common people to get involved". If one cannot afford a whole bitcoin at ~$250, then they could consider buying .1, .01, .001, etc. 
In contrast, one cannot purchase fractional amounts of stock (for example, a tenth of a share of google). Moreover, with other commodities, such as gold, it can be hard to purchase miniscule amounts outside of the standard ounce or troy ounce coins/bars.
My final point is that is the actual price of bitcoin is down tremendously since its $1000+ bubble, making it a rather opportune time to buy in my eyes (with the one exception that if you bought bitcoin before it hit $100 or even $10, you might feel like it is still rather high, but that is because your perception is so dramatically skewed to the earliest moments of bitcoin's history)

So there's this thing called AML-KYC ("Anti-Money Laundering Know Your Customer") that businesses have to follow. If that was a joke from your friend, that was a stupid one with no punch-line. Can't blame Coinbase for following the law, which is black and white in this case.
@_date: 2015-03-07 17:14:52
Well, think about the effect that debt has on the value of the U.S. Dollar. Why does it have an effect? Confidence, right. The same thing that is propping up the value in the first place. If the value of the dollar falls, the value of bitcoin relative to the dollar rises.
In short, bitcoin is related to the dollar because it is frequently exchanged to/from the dollar. Now maybe this explanation is too reductive, but I really hope to turn the conversation away from whether or not this post is off-topic (it clearly isn't IMO), and rather focus on the implications this will have for the entire world, and for bitcoin as an alternative store of value.

Quite possibly. That's because the chance of a government shutdown is slim and even if it does happen, one can safely assume that the debt ceiling will be raised in a short period of time. Is this 100% certain though? Absolutely not.

You might want to check out Piper Wallet, a paper wallet printer made by Cryptographi. It is completely secure (you can verify the source code and compile it yourself), and it is as simple as turning it on, If you plug it in to a monitor though, there are a bunch of other features and customization options. The company is really friendly, and personally, I received a bunch of extra paper rolls to go with it.
Of course, the one downside to paper wallets is that the paper can be lost or rendered unreadable for various reasons. You can print multiple copies with Piper, but you can also choose to have it store a copy digitally on the attached SD card. This works great, especially with encrypted private keys.

Shift reduces friction by making bitcoin easier to spend with merchants. It allows you to convert Bitcoin to USD currently at no charge.

I second the need for resources (stickers/flyers/etc). Unfortunately, this is not a priority of Bitcoin Foundation at this point in time. 
Would anyone like to collaborate and help produce these materials that we could distribute digitally and have supporters print &amp; post, for flyers at least.
For stickers we could potentially take the tips we might receive from the initial flyer designs to custom print the stickers in bulk and sell **AT COST** so that supporters can buy them for very cheap and give out wherever they are.
Essentially, we could be the unofficial bitcoin marketing squad. The key differentiator here compared with other businesses is that the motive would not be profit based. It would require 100% transparency so supporters would know this is the very best way to obtain bitcoin resources for distribution (until Bitcoin Foundation steps up its own ground marketing efforts!)

Alright fair enough, I am convinced. No doubt that $1-5 would be a really effective paywall for email, in addition to the pr/visibility aspect for the sender.
Do you happen to work for wrte.io or hopefully someone there sees this: I think that screenshot on the homepage should be changed, $100 hopefully isn't representative of the average cost users are going to be charging so it gives the wrong impression, IMO.

Personally I disagree. I think that Trezor can be used for storing or spending with equal security and protection.
My plan is to use Trezor as a medium-term storage (3-5 years) at which point I will re-evaluate my options.
That said, your shared paper wallet sounds like an interesting idea. The challenge of geographic dispersal is what prevents me from doing that.

Hi, welcome to the community!
It really is pretty easy to get started accepting bitcoins and there are a few ways to do it:
1) Manage everything yourself. This route entails picking a Wallet ([ and simply publishing your public address to your website. Usually you would turn this address into a QR code so that it is easier for individuals to just point and scan rather than enter in the address manually.
2) You could let someone else manage everything for you. In a way, this is a "safer" approach, in the sense that it makes it very easy to convert to dollars and make sure payment is received before sending the item. [BitPay]( and [Coinbase]( are the biggest companies that do that in the U.S.
There are a lot of resources available for people like yourself who are beginning to accept bitcoin so check around the web. You are in the right place that is for sure!

No, it's not a concern if the price of bitcoin skyrockets, it's a great thing. That means you can realize a profit.
Governments ALREADY impose capital gains tax on BTC and if you are a citizen of the U.S., you are obligated to report and pay them. However, for the hodlers here like myself, capital gains rates are lower for long-term holding.

Yes it's unfortunate, but definitely doesn't take away the appeal of a decentralized exchange since regulations vary by country and competition from many MSBs would potentially lower fees. I think there might also be a clause that allows individuals to sell bitcoin without a MSB license in the U.S. but it can't be as a business and I'm not exactly sure the details of all of that.

Absolutely, couldn't agree more. What I've outlined is just a theory and one that cannot be proven until Satoshi Nakamoto decides to come forward himself/herself and sign to the genesis block.
That said, it is not a matter of if the real Satoshi Nakamoto will be identified, it is when. At a certain critical point of mass adoption where the economic welfare of possibly a large portion of the world relies on bitcoin, it might be necessary to know who may possess the keys to 1 million coins. It is quite possible that multiple sources are sitting on the information. Who knows.
If it is Mochizuki, however, I do hope that he comes forward one day. A Nobel Laureate Prize in Economics will be waiting.

@_date: 2016-07-20 19:46:49
That's interesting, sounds like a fun challenge. This might give you some tips to break through. From 
Bitcoin is like…
Bitcoin is like physical cash: it is not reversible and you are responsible for handling it. If you lose your wallet, you lose your money. You can give bitcoins to someone to hold them for you, but it will be like with any bank: you have to trust them that they won’t run away with your cash.
Bitcoin is unlike physical cash: you can store as much as you want and it will not take any space. You can send it over the wire to anyone. It is impossible to counterfeit. You can’t give it in one second: to actually guarantee that transaction has happened, you have to wait 10-15 minutes for the cryptographic proof to be produced by the network. However, for small in-person payments you sometimes can accept zero-confirmation payments with relatively low risk of transaction being cancelled.
Bitcoin is like gold: it cannot be produced at will, there’s a limited amount of it and this amount is scattered in spacetime continuum (mostly time). To get some bitcoins someone should give them to you, or you should mine them. Like gold, Bitcoin is shiny: it attracts people with its beautiful engineering, built-in contract programming language, wise incentives, and libertarian promise of freedom from coercion.
Bitcoin is unlike gold: supply of Bitcoin is completely fixed via scheduled mining (only so much bitcoins are created per hour). You have a guarantee that no one will suddenly find a mountain of bitgold or mine it on asteroids. Unlike gold, Bitcoin difficulty is adjusted to the mining efforts to keep the schedule fixed. You may dig up all the gold in one day, but it will never be possible with Bitcoin no matter how fast computers will ever become. Growing mining efforts can only bend schedule slightly (network adjusts difficulty to producing 6 blocks per hour, but if network constantly grows it may produce 7-8 blocks per hour).
Bitcoin is like bank: there are computers, a database and transactions. Database stores entire history of all incoming and outgoing payments: who send how much to whom. Everything is digital. There are no vaults with gold or personal deposit boxes, only bookkeeping in a single “ledger”.
Bitcoin is unlike bank: everyone can verify the integrity of the ledger. There is no manager in charge of updating the ledger and making sure it is not tampered with. Any person may have as many accounts as they like and all accounts are anonymous (unless one reveals his identity himself). Ledger does not store names, only balances and account numbers. There is no possibility of “fractional reserve” when bank loans out more money than it actually has. In fact, there are no debts on bitcoin ledger: either you have money on your address and it is fully yours, or you don’t and you can’t use it at all. Also, Bitcoin allows to lock money with “contracts”: cryptographic puzzles designed to spread the decision making between several people or across time.
Bitcoin is like Monopoly money: there are abstract tokens that are not claims to any value. People value them because they choose to play the game. In fact, the same is true for gold or any other money.
Bitcoin is unlike Monopoly money: there is a limited supply of tokens and no one can counterfeit them. This makes them a good candidate for a universally recognized collectible like gold or silver coins.
Bitcoin is like Git: in Git (a distributed version control system) all your changes are organized in a chain protected by cryptographic hashes. If you trust the latest hash, you can get all the previous information (or any part of it) from any source and still verify that it is what you expect. Similarly, in Bitcoin, all transactions are organized in a chain (the blockchain) and once validated, no matter where they are stored, you can always trust any piece of blockchain by checking a chain of hashes that link to a hash you already trust. This naturally enables distributed storage and easy integrity checks.
Bitcoin is unlike Git in a way that everyone strives to work on a single branch. In Git everyone may have several branches and fork and merge them all day long. In Bitcoin one cannot “merge” forks. Blockchain is a actually a tree of transaction histories, but there is always one biggest branch (which has the value) and some accidental mini-branches (no more than one-two blocks long) that have no value at all. In Git content matters (regardless of the branch), in Bitcoin consensus matters (regardless of the content).
Bitcoin is like Bittorrent: the network is fully decentralized, there is no single “mint” or “bank”. The blockchain is like a single file on bittorrent: cryptographically authenticated and shared across many computers. Every participant, including miners are acting on equal grounds. If one part of the network becomes disrupted, transactions can flow through other parts. Even if the entire network goes down, information about transactions is still stored on many thousands of independent computers and no one’s money is lost. When people connect with each other again, they can continue sending transactions like nothing happened. Both Bitcoin and Bittorrent can survive a nuclear war because information does not become radioactive and can be safely replicated.
Bitcoin is unlike Bittorrent: instead of many independent “files”, there is one file that always grows: the blockchain. Also, the most important participants: miners are actually getting rewarded for their work with real money.
Bitcoin is like freedom of speech: every transaction is a short public message that can be pronounced no matter where or how. If some miners hear it, they will add it in the blockchain and that message will be forever in the history. Everyone will see it and no one will be able to erase it.
Bitcoin is unlike freedom of speech: saying something comes with a cost. Transaction moves coins that you must have to start with. So not every moron is allowed to shout, but only those who had a merit to acquire some coins in the first place. Also, miners may reject transaction if it’s spammy or does not contain enough fees. So no one provides anyone with freedom as “in beer”, but everyone tries to cooperate on a voluntary basis.
Bitcoin is like magic internet money: it simply is.

I didn't mean to sound snarky, it's just a hypothetical question. In other words, no one knows, the shopkeeper sets the price regardless! It's based on supply and demand. Less supply should mean a higher price given equal demand, but of course speculation changes the dynamic.

Yes, the optional passphrase is considered the hidden 25th word. You can even create multiple passphrases. For example, if someone was trying to rob you, you could enter an alternative passphrase that would reveal a miniscule amount rather than your entire savings.

What I find particularly odd is that most of the compensation is centered around a handful of content creators that seem to be closely related to the project. I'm worried that the value and growth numbers are all hot air to create buzz and a self-fulling prophecy.

It's going to be hard (almost impossible) to mine with a low cost ASIC miner at this point. Personally, I would suggest investing into bitcoin itself ($20 could easily turn into a few hundred if not thousand in the long term). This would far exceed what you could earn through mining. If you still want to get involved in mining though, there's NastyFans and a bunch of other ones where you basically buy shares in mining.

Yes, I don't mean individual purchases but rather the timing of when you acquired bitcoin. Essentially, the sooner you acquire it, the more likely you have a larger piece because the price was lower. Halving events could be an interesting measurement since the price increased 50x from the first to the present. RemindMe! 4 years "Did the price increase 50x AGAIN :D?"

I think that's the correct view from today's perspective, but as I said, it would be a paradigm shift. In the future, perhaps it is not the case that all machines have owners. Of course, they will always have creators, but imagine a scenario where a completely autonomous vehicle is released into the wild that would be able to sell rides in order to pay for it's shelter (parking), food (fuel), health care (maintenance), and store/transfer value and ownership. That just scratches the surface of what's possible in that world.

I'm sure Amazon, Google, and even Apple will all want a piece of the action. It's not comparable to 21's solution though because without Bitcoin as a value transfer, the systems will rely on intermediary payment processors. Machines can't apply for lines of credit themselves, for example.

What makes your gem of a coin particularly special is that it's only 1 of 150 AND in mint condition -- this alone makes it worth 1.5-3x more. So, on a good day it might be worth $13,862.70 right now. Here's where it gets fun: Tim Draper and a bunch of other notable tech VCs think Bitcoin could be worth as much as $10,000 per BTC in the next 5-10 years as the market cap grows. In fact, if Bitcoin had a market cap similar to Facebook or Google it certainly would be that expensive, and it's an international protocol not a centralized corporation. At that price, you'd have something worth between $150,000-$300,000.

No one knows for sure, but in my opinion go for it! There's no better time to invest in bitcoin with all that is going on - you won't be able to time your entrance perfectly but in the long run (think 2-10+ years) the difference will be minuscule.

I believe cloud mining is different than mining in a pool though right? NastyMining is a very small 0% fee pool and NastyFans is a way to basically buy a small percentage of a S9/mining equipment. Here's some more info  but definitely let me know if you have any other information that indicates scam or likewise, I would certainly appreciate it!

I'm trying to understand the situation, what are the facts? How did they steal from you? Was it Purse.io or the other party (buyer/seller)?

Nice, I almost missed that. It's like taking candy from a baby. And by baby I mean banker.

I like it, but I don't own any fiat coins to put in it ;) Just kidding of course, but really, this is an awesome piece of art and I wish I could collect one.

Absolutely not, but it's also not fair to say they are running out of money and must pivot, as this invalidates the work they've done and what they are building towards. It takes time to execute a long-term, potentially paradigm-shifting vision.

Wow that is insane! Are you able to use offliberty.com to download it? If not, try another proxy or VPN, otherwise I would offer to upload on my own server (but my home internet is quite slow upstream). It looks like a good program!

AFAIK it's been out of stock for quite a while pointing toward a discontinuation. If I remember correctly, there may have been a logistics issue with problems of seals be broken during delivery. I recommend checking out Piper Wallet, which is a bit more expensive, but basically is a mycelium entropy + thermal printer combined.

I believe his email is CryptoImperator check Bitcointalk to make sure but yes they are loaded with 0.125 in order to guarantee that all 100 get funded.

Search for a file named wallet.dat. Perhaps you can use some recovery software to specifically target that file. I'm sorry for your loss.

Wow, this is a great new service by Vinny Lingham! I suggest everyone check out civic.com first to see what they actually do before signing up.

Both, but I lean toward the latter.

No, there's not one example that comes close to that, because remember this is all happening digitally without an intermediary or human interference. Not one company can claim to have this level of efficiency to-date nor even come close. There are many settlement layers including different levels of banks and credit processors that can be replaced by bitcoin (some directly on the blockchain, but others will require layer 2 or layer 3 solutions). Now, the question becomes: how are layer 2/3 bitcoin solutions different than the status-quo? That's where it gets interesting...
