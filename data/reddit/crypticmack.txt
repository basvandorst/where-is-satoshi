Then what? Proof of stake or something?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:13:22
Doesn't sound scaleable to me.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:14:51
I think ETH plans on converting to the no mining boat in the future as well no?

Ready? Go get the vaseline

Sheep.. I'm no bitcoin purist but you're missing a fundamental point. Btc price doesn't really fluctuate due to the terrible practice of inflation (a little until all 21 million are mined). The fact that all of these central banks have the power to print monopoly money and the rest of us just sit there and take it is what btc fights against. If/when btc becomes a more common commodity, people wont be able to magically print more and the market will set the price of this self banking system. If you can't comprehend this, crypto isn't for you. You'll treat it like a get rich quick scheme and get schemed on by volatile prices

Keynesian economics is a joke! Wake up. Any real economist laughs at it. Only lefties believe this garbage as it's the only way they can pretend to fund their utopias while pretending they're not going broke.

Miners confirm transactions on the blockchain and that's how the whole thing works
@_date: 2018-09-16 03:54:48
2nd tier countries? Ever heard of the federal reserve? A private bank that prints USD? The bank that our Congress pretends to have control over? Just because the system works for now doesn't mean it's not fundamentally flawed..

What if it costs 150k to mine a coin etc. Is this really a viable solution or is there more to the future of btc?
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:55:24
My TA says odds are we'll see 5k range from here. Come see this message in a couple of days. TA is not magic it's logic and reasoning. Trying to predict next month's price is bullshit but understanding current market conditions to hedge your bets on an investment is not new or magic.. Just takes a little testicular fortitude, something all you soyboys lack.
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:05:55
Speak for yourself or tell that to the people who bought above 7k...
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:59:03
Every TA from January indicated it's an obvious bear market meanwhile you hodl retards were losing your money month after month asking "when lambo?" while every whale and seasoned trader were dumping their position above 10k and buying dips..
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:34:55
Stupid.. no one needs btc to buy coffee.. you should be more excited about custodial players such as ICE. Goofy as meaningless hype news is what this Starbucks news is
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:14:15
More like "my body my right to kill a baby" by leftist logic I can kill my child since they require my assistance to survive 
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:56:26
.... it's still gambling but with TA you can keep track of what cards hit the table to better your odds. You're all fools if you don't think it's important to pay attention to support and resistance levels, fibonacci or other indicators. It's understanding human behavior and more beneficial for day trading not holding.

What shitcoins?

Keep laughing at Americans who desire freedom. Freedom isn't just a cute idea.. you socialist and leftist want to live in a utopia, here's a good example of your utopia 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:41:44
War is bipartisan and you're stupid if you think otherwise. Murdering babies is not a right and true conservatism believes in limited government and permits personal freedoms like drug use. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:30:18
Then they're not true conservatives in the American sense who believe in liberty.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:39:54
I'm more of the libertarian right. Give me one example other than drugs that the right tries to restrict.
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:26:36
I bought all my btc bellow 900.. Never try looking into someones pockets in a failed attempt to make point.
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:14:49
Very close minded and ignorant outlook. BTC was not designed for daps and high throughput functions. Imo, btc=digital gold. Doesn't mean projects like eos for daps or eng for data anonymity have no purpose.
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:57:25
Tell me how you'll build daps or privatize data on a blockchain using btc? I got most of my btc under 900, don't worry about my pockets.
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:04:39
I'm always confused by this.. does the seller actually take btc or is it just converted to usd beforehand??
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:48:01
People have gotten arrested for that in the states
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:27:16
Typical btc maximalists blowing smoke up their own asses..
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:42:40
Can't manipulate the fact that there was no buy volume..

All you scary "investors" say this meanwhile the real were slowly bulking up during the lows..
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:11:53
This is not the guy you want on your side.
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:12:55
Oh yeah, nothing like all that fresh African capital to increase the price of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:01:26
I still don't understand who made this guy a good source for crypto info..
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:54:40
But how is bitcoin a store of value?
@_date: 2018-07-31 04:40:33
Btc went from 20k to 5k.. why would the average personal feel btc is not a risky investment? I like me some bitcoin but it's stupid to expect people to view btc as a non volatile investment
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:05:11
This is Berkley... why are we surprised?
@_date: 2018-04-08 06:37:50
Sounds like a trap to get you on big brother's radar...
