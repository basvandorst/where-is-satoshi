OP: Your idea is interesting.  But, I would say that if you are going to do what you want to do, You should stay away from places that have KYC.  You need to remain anon.  Anything less than that is a defeating of the purpose of the whole idea of what you are trying to do.

You are the person for whom I have been looking!  What I mean is that I don't want anything from you.  I just think that we need to get away from fiat.  I am myself looking at store of value.  I have some B at 400 when I bought in.  I want to continue to accumulate and not sell.  I want a long lasting store of value.  
Gold also.

I used moneymoneymoney.   you can look it up in bitaddress.  it was a brain wallet.   Any common words strung together will end up being in a dictionary/set.  I am going to make complicated words that are not English, or any language, but I can still remember it as a brain wallet. 
I want to pass on my btc's to my posterity.  As quantum computers come on, I think the security of our wallets will be more and more threatened.  So, we must evolve.

You know, you open a bank account, and you give the govt a way to monitor and look into how you are spending your money.  You drive on the road, you get pulled over by the cops.
Under the guise of: 1. anti-terroism,   2 anti-drugs . . . our country is not the "land of the free" that it claims to be. It is so so sad as I am facing this uncomfortable but undeniable truth.
sorry to bring this poopy news to everyone.
sorry.
