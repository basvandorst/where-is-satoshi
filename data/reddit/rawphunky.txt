If you can not push transaction with lowest possible fee ppl will start fighting and fees might skyrocket...
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:51:50
Thank you for suggestions to choose another forum. And you missed the point even if I tried to explain... =]
Why the hell ppl make high fee transactions when the mempool is much smaller and they could easily make smaller once? Is it wallets making wrong decisions on how big the fee should be?
That is what my picture was showing... A stack of high fee transactions missing middle fee transactions at all.
And this issue can potential lead to growing fees much faster than it could otherwise

true even leaving few words out would be easy to brute force.


not true, every word is needed
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:54:43
substituting with meaningless word is terrible idea. There is a finite word list of 2048 words. If you enter word not from that list is obvious.

Well it gets "empty" every time miners can include all transactions in the block. Why is that bad? It always used to be like that until the usage of the BTC exploded.
If the mempool never reaches bottom, the bottom layer of the mempool will start to get more and more expensive. We'll just cut the bottom of the pie with cheaper fees and throw away. 
Now to the point of my post / picture - during the weekend we cleared a lot of the pool and now ppl can make cheaper tx but they do not! they still make a layer of 300 transactions and that new layer will become a new base of the pie. Most probably it's a mistake that wallets recommend too high fees for the current mempool situation.
I hope this speculation is wrong because I would like to be able to make transactions that doesn't cost insane amounts...
And it's still sad to see all the angry ppl here arguing all the time =] It's good that it makes the technology stronger by challenging the believes, but all the negativity is super sad.

Yea you can change as many words from the list in any way and the more you change the harder it will be for the attacker to steal and for you to remember after years go by :D
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:14:23
Yea I've been reading both of them and depending in witch one you post your question you will get different answers. No way to get constructive discussions everybody is just greedy and insulting each other... I hope this will not cause WWIII eventually :D

I'm not supporting ether side and try to find objective information. But my posts here with simple question were deleted and in another group i got answers... So speech of freedom speaks for it self

I'm not into propaganda: 
Try to find this post in this subreddit ;)
Edit: basically I was worried about this situation and instead of discussion I got nothing here...

I know how bitcoin works (I'm an engineer and been supporting BTC since 2013)
That post was just my speculation / worry about the current situation, just waned to see what ppl will think about it. And it got me disappointed a lot about the state of this sub...
It's also fascinating to see how these two sides / camps are building up and fighting each other... Too much money on the table...

Well, if you will never clear mempool completely it means that there will be always be dropped tx(with cheapest fees). 
So you are filling the top of the pool with more expensive tx and dropping cheapest once from the bottom.
This would grow fees to the point where ppl would not be willing to pay them anymore. 
Sounds like a nice self regulating market right? But here we enter the risk that ppl will be discouraged to use BTC. And as the value of BTC will grow the fees will follow and finally only only the richest once will be able to make txs.
Also Small wallets will become unspendable.
And I don't see how LN can solve this? Having your BTC to move in / out to blockchain &lt;-&gt; channel would cost a loooot. Until you reach the point where no one wants to go back to BTC anymore at all and we end up with all money flowing only in LN. Then what's the use of BTC block chain anyway? :D
We've already entered the state where ppl putting money to BTC to use it as a store of value. Nobody gives a fuck about it's usability. Everybody understands how this pyramid works... The regular Joe at the bottom of the pyramid is funding everyone else. But guess what will happen once the fees will be to high for the Joe to join in? Who is going to fund the pyramid?

Well you can be angry or open minded it's up to you. I don't really care about all these propaganda claims. 
First I was not talking about 0-fee.
Now think about current situation or my post more... If the mempool never reaches bottom the bottom layer of the mempool will start to get more and more expensive (we'll just cut the bottom of the pie with cheaper fees and throw away)
Think you send tx it doesn't go through you try another one with higher fee. Then I need a tx and I need to beat everyone bellow in the pie so I make tx with even higher fee... So that's what everyone understands...
Now the point of my post / picture - during the weekend we cleared a lot of the pool and now ppl can make cheaper tx but they do not! they still make a layer of 300 transactions and that new layer will become a new base of the pie. Most probably it's a mistake that wallets recommend too high fees for the current mempool situation.
I hope this speculation is wrong because I would like to be able to make transactions that doesn't cost insane amounts...
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:10:59


why it should have no tx? Every block will have all the tx occurred in 10 mins. And the more tx we have the more fees.
This system encourages ppl to use BTC and the more they use it the more fees miners will have.
But I have to admit I don't know what is a good amount for that small fee? If the value of BTC keeps growing the fees would become more expensive... But I guess someone already knows the answer to this?
At this moment I don't see how ether BTC or BCH can scale so that all sides participating in network are happy.

I would buy in more, unfortunately fiat does not flow on holidays... :D Because bank servers are on holiday...
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:27:20
Well the more miners we have the more fees we need to make them happy. And the more fees we collect the more miners will come... And they'll want more fees... You see where it goes?
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:22:38
The fees are already too high for micro transactions, especially if you live in low / medium wealth country. 
Today I have payed 0.0035 BTC for my short taxi ride and 0.0001 fee witch is almost 3% of the price.
So for the cup of coffee the fee might get to 10% of the price...
And I live in medium wealth country; I have a feeling that in poor countries it might be much worse...
One more problem is that most mobile wallets don't detect when the fee is not needed. My self being an experienced software developer I still had trouble understanding when I need to pay fee and when my transaction can be made free... While experimenting I got couple of my free transactions not being confirmed for 24h or so. 
In any case Gavin, thanks for your hard work and good look creating innovation and making the world better place to live in!

Well, you forgot one important tip:
If you do the math and assume that BTC price will go up. Buying everything possible with BTC saves you money. Coffee will be cheaper at a time you buy it due to BTC value raise. 
So just create pocket BTC wallet and keep refilling it once per month / week... Profit by saving. Afc this works only if BTC price keeps going up...
