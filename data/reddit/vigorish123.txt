Yeah, but as a management/owners would you prefer to lose it all or sell it at a huge discount and work for options?

Guys, this is one of the biggest exchanges, easily worth more than $200mln. Do you really think they will let this business go bust?
They have investors, there are VC's, miners, exchanges that will find mere $70mln to buy equity at a huge bargain, no problem.

Man, their revenue is around $3M per year.

Zane, let's assume I have bitcoins in my trading wallet and I open margin short. Do I sell my own bitcoins first or borrowed ones?
Thanks a lot!

Making customers whole will increase their business to the moon. 
On the other hand anything else will make them go bust.
Do the math.

not their only source, but it gives us rough estimate.
Multiply it by 2x, 3x or 4x, still &gt; 5 years to make the hack.

Hey, I had 92BTC at bitfinex and margin short for 111BTC. Does it count as having 92BTC (practically I am selling all my BTC's by having margin short this big) in cash and the rest borrowed?
By the way those were my entire savings + small loan from a bank. Now I am broke.
Nonetheless, Zane, you are doing a great job here.

For each maker there is one taker. So let's assume the fee is 0.2% per transaction. Let's assume their average daily volume is $5mln.
Whis gives us around 300*$5mln per year whis is $1.5bln of volume yearly. That is $3mln of revenue per year. They have costs as well.
That means the hack is worth ~25years of current revenue.
Do the math.

So if we average this data their lending revenue is merely $1.5M.
Fees from trading $5M tops.
Which gives us optimisticaly ~$7M revenue not including costs.
Which gives us what, 10 years to make the loss?

My question is exactly: is sale of x BTC that I have equal to having margin short of x BTC that I have?
I mean, the first option equals in cash, obviously, but the second one?

I prefer safe assumption, but if your estimate is correct then we are in very good situation actually. On 30m revenue they are worth minimum 300m.
Edit: were worth :P

They invested in Netki and ShapeShift.
$3.5mln and $1.5mln respectively. Which gives us at least additional $5mln in assets.
If they invested additional $5mln in other companies. We're at $10mln in assets.
If they have this kind of cash to invest, we can estimate additional $10mln in cash or other assets, which means they have at least $20mln to cover the loses.
