*Everyone's talking about the 15% drop yesterday but they are ignoring the still 10% gain over last week!*
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:17:48
Yup the moon shot past $20k will start a frenzy that I don't even know where it might land!
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:13:56
Can confirm, mined Bitcoin for $3 and sold em for $6 :(
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:06:03
Now ~~$11,900~~ ~~$12,750~~ $12,500

Maybe not on this run but think about it this way:
How many people do you know who are excited about holding Gold?  How many new people are joining the Gold market?  Gold is worth like $8T in total "market cap" (used loosely).  If Bitcoin hits 50% of that it has to be worth $200K per coin.

Yeah like the dump from $27 down to $4, back to $250 then down to $50, then $1200 down to $250, then $20,000 down to $3500.  The dump will be somewhere around $50,000 - $100,000 if I'm guessing right!

HODLRs love it!
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:18:53


Good investment strategy Cotton, lets see if it pays off for him!
But honestly, don't sell if it corrects a little based on this 10% gains per day trend we have been seeing.  HODL long term!
I know we haven't hit full FOMO yet.  You know how?  We haven't crossed $20K at which point Google Trends for "Bitcoin" will be back to crazy levels.  Right now this growth has been from the big boys not really brand new people entering, when they do OH YOU JUST WATCH!

NEW FLASH BITCOIN CRASHES TO YESTERDAYS VALUE!
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:22:39
Nah you aren't getting crypto hot tips from your Uber driver yet.  That will be peak.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:11:17
False.  $20K high was a brief instant of time, they might have been close but not $20K.  Show me the transactions on  the blockchain.  People claim all kinds of crazy stuff, doesn't make it true.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:14:21
Not "only hope" but do some math.  Bitcoin is currrently @ $200 billion.  Cisco Systems is $240 billion.  The value of all the gold in the world is estimated somewhere around $7.5 trillion.
If Bitcoin were "the new gold" and takes over 50% of the Gold market, well prices have to be in the $200,000 per coin range I believe if I did the math right.  (not exact math, just bouncing around numbers here!)
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:22:05
But Google Trends shows TomatIRL is probably correct and olafg1 is wrong, when the public sees $20K and CNBC goes crazy... well $50K here we come!
There.  Will.  Only.  Be.  21.  Million.  EVER!
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:30:17


Hint:  No one actually did that.  I always said I could mine a bitcoin for $3 and sell it for $6.  So I did  :(    Still here watching the fun however...
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:41:02
Yup I expect a $50K to $15K correction somewhere in there, but who knows could be another one!
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:24:24
Yup run to $26 crash to $4, then $250 crash to $50, then $1200 crash to $250, then $20K crash to $3.5K... the trend is real!
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:24:57


You think thats bad, it went from a hundred up to $1200 in 2013 then MTGOX collapsed and we basically slid slowly all the way down to around $200 for OVER 3 years before it recovered.  No that was the "depression phase!"  Oh jeez still up 10% for the week?  We hit $13K wayyyy too fast.  Gainz are still coming, just it will bounce around for a bit now that the crazy has fully hit!
