so all of the above.

It makes bitcoin look like a brand name, and therefore a con.
EDIT: you can downvote all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that people spend more time promoting bitcoin than actually using it. And there need to be companies without *bit* in the name.

Did something happen?

@_date: 2015-01-26 01:06:34
Never thought of that. Are you saying base 10 is base 10 for base 10?
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:23:20
Bought a bunch at $90, sold most at $1000 :(

I lost at least 15 btc through shit like this. Makes me nauseous.
