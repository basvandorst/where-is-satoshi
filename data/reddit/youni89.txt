Ita obvious whoever hired bitgo stole the funds with their help and has absolved them of all responsibilities. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:44:54
I still want to know what's Bitgo's share of the responsibility is in all of this.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:09:50
Better sell em quick because price dropping fast from $1.9bil.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:54:10
Your mother is just trying to look out for you :)
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:35:00
It's not a currency anymore. It's a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:46:51
Havent seen it that high I'm sure 20k was the highest it ever went to
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:55:00
so as long as we're focusing on technology, it doesn't matter if Bitcoin succeeds, or any other coins like Ethereum or BCH or Ripple succeeds, as long as the technology is propagated and people use it.
So we shouldn't advocated for any one coin's success, but the tech. And the only reason we advocate for Bitcoin's success is because we are invested in it (with money). 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:39:15
yes you can.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:59:08
HODL is always followed by "I'm cashing out at *insert date here*". It is all about making money and cashing out when you think you'll be rich.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:48:18
Segwit is already out but nobody uses it. And it will be the same with LN. This is due to the fact that the miners want/need high tx fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:07:51
Abandon ship!
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:54:22
This. This is the tell-tale sign of a pozi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:18:48
But Bitcoin is already useless... did you guys not see Steam ditching BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:50:52
It's insider trading when your coin goes down, but when your coin gets pumped from $1000 to $19,000 it's totally natural. /s
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:59
I think its already too late. Bitcoin is dead. It's was a nice intro coin into other more useful cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:06:39
I remember when Bitcoin was actually semi-useful as a currency. Now they've evolved into a "store-of-value". I guess I'll just use other cryptos with better tech then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:16:28
why would I read your posts? I don't really care what coins you hold
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:45:47
I'm the ignorant one because I'm not part of the circle jerk constantly parroting HODL and pretending that there is adoption when companies like Steam just dropped Bitcoin because it sucks. ok.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:32:11
But when? Are you going to be hearding about it 3 years down the line too?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:15:09
They do know that it exists since they sell it at the same place you have to buy Bitcoin from, chief example being Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:29:42
You have my pity as well, bag holder. Cya later goober.

Yea how dare he use his own money the way he wants
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:09:25
Who is everyone? the chinese mining conglomerates or the developers at bitcoin core? Because both of them together probably constitute less than 1% of bitcoin "users".
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:11:59
The market hasn't made clear of anything yet. Crypto is still young and most of market activity right now is pure speculation akin to the tech bubble. When that bubble burst, only the most resilient companies with REAL FUNCTIONALITY survived. Also, Bitcoin is a terrible store of value since a good store of value should be a stable asset, not a one that fluctuates wildly up and down 20%+ every few days. 
We may see the same thing happening in the cryptosphere soon enough.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:35:32
So this either incentivizes the miners to charge ever higher fees to make up for the loss in block reward revenue, or they'll simply stop maintaining the bitcoin network and move onto another coin they can mine profitably. Pretty much signals the demise of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:25:48
Ofcourse. The end goal of 99% who have cryptocurrency is the eventual CASH OUT, into... you guessed it.... FIAT CASH... into,.. you guessed it again... their BANK ACCOUNT.
And good on them for acting on their own self-interests. I don't want them wasting money and time in chase of some destroy-the-banks pipe dream.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:44:39
This guy bought at the very top. lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:43:59
Telling people who bought at 18k to shut the fuck up and ride the wave all the way down to 9k. Ok LOL
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:46:48
Unless I'm misunderstanding something, Coinbase is not just Bitcoin exclusive? They can add whatever coins they want.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:45:13
You forgot the word "might". Bitcoin is not a certainty, and with all its problems right now it's looking less like a sure thing.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:29:37
It's now at 14k tho
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:09:16

Congratulations on freedom! :) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:22:37
yea I don't think so. I already made more money than you this year, and Ripple went up way more than Bitcoin this year too. Oh, and also Ripple already recovered its price well above $1 while Bitcoin is languishing at 12-13k. Honestly, I don't think Bitcoin is going to make it.
But good luck with that bag tho.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:46:56
Select the lowest fee and wait 4 weeks for it to be confirmed, or get kicked out of the block to try again.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:37:01
Why would you want to make another fork that is better than Bitcoin? You want to kill bitcoin even faster?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:53:28
What does Steam dropping Bitcoin mean moving forward? Is Bitcoin competitive compared to the dollar, credit card companies, paypal, as well as other alts? Is it making an effort to become competitive?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:57:49
what are you doing, trying to make small transactions with bitcoins? don't you know Bitcoin is only for rich people?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:30:44
Nah, we're all just here to make money. Gonna cash out before this bubble bursts.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:22:42
Most early adopters sold. Majority of bitcoins are owned by typical wall-streeters like the winklevoss twins.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:27:27
what do you mean? Segwit has a seasly 15% adoption rate and falling. Nobody uses segwit and LN.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:32:05
This will surely make transactions faster and lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:43:33
10 years later:
"give us more time! It's still early!" while other altcoins have left Bitcoin in the dust
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:35:18
You should do your own research and invest in other coins that gives you confidence and where you can see actual utility in the real world. Only the coins that are being used effectively will survive.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:18:23
It's not a "traditional" crypto like Bitcoin, if that's what you mean. But who cares about that, as long as it changes the world and makes me richer along the way, then I'll support it. I have no loyalties for Bitcoin or other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:51:44
Bitcoin does not redistribute wealth. It in fact enhances wealth inequality because the poor and the middle class are forced to hold their bitcoins (if they ever buy any) in the hopes of the price increasing indefinitely, which it will not. The rich are able to buy a large supply and manipulate the market, cashing out at the top, crashing the price, and buying in low. These profits come at the expense of the bag holders (the poor and the middle class), who cannot afford to sell and but continue to hold the bags in the hopes of the price recovering and going back up. They hope for an eventual payout while the rich continues to take profit after at every dip.
Second of all, bitcoin blockchain can do none of the things you describe such as keeping track of energy resources in a community or the movement of a spaceship. It's not built in a way to work in that capacity. Ethereum is a far better system to do this. Bitcoin is a payment/currency system, and so far it is failing miserable at what it is designed to do.
And lastly, all currencies aren't ponzi schemes like Bitcoin is becoming. The USD does well what it's designed to do (representing debt) and it's valuable because you can actually use it to buy things and it's backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Bitcoin is terrible at what it's designed to do (extremely slow settlement times, 250k unconfirmed transactions, sky-high fees) and it isn't backed by anything.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:42:46
Takes hours or days to send bitcoin anywhere. Transaction fees are sky high. Can't buy anything with Bitcoin because I'll be paying more in fees and the merchant will have to wait hours or days to receive payment. Price is also crashing, which was all it had going for it. Yea, it's not working. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:03:59
Because greedy miners and blockstream.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:30:58
It is true. Banks aren't going anywhere anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:40:08
Because I'm a decent human being?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:04:35
but when? and even if it gets implemented, will exchanges and miners adopt it? They are barely adopting segwit right now as it is.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:30:11
It does matter because without real utility it'll die a slow death.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:05:30
It's funny how people here are shouting copyright infringement and copycating. 
It's almost like they think they're Satoshi smh
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:36:28
Did you not see Steam give up on Bitcoin a few days ago? Bitcoin is owned by wall-street now it's just a speculative vehicle to make money.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:48:53
what spam?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:37:17
It doesn't matter anymore. Bitcoin is no longer a currency, it's a speculative investment where people only care about the price. So what if there's 218K backlog in transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:37:43
A true bag holder. Hold on tight for everyone cashing out my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:59:02
ok keep holding that bag.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:20:59
Wow, a real boomer. What kind of advice do you have for us youngins investment/money-wise, even though you haven't quite seen something like crypto in your early days?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:02:52
Crypto can support banks? Crypto is a technology not a state of mind, and tech can be used for literally anything.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:31:07
It's funny because they're all advocating about Lightning network lowering the fees to almost 0, but what they don't realize that the miners who actually process the transactions don't want/can't afford nil fees and won't implement LN network. If they are somehow forced to (they can't since they control the bitcoin network with all the hash rate) they'll just switch to something else more profitable. Bitcoin is effectively dead at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:23:31
Bose they want to make money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:47:29
Calm down.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:51:22
have them sell it (thus they pay the transaction fees and taxes) and pay you in USD.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:46:59
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:04:30
Hi! Check out Rippex or Toast wallet! They're both very secure and free to use :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:54:53
All of XRP is pre-mined, they can't create as much as they like. If they wanted to create more then it would require a hard-fork of the Ripple ledger. And as far as I know, they have no intention of doing a hard fork.
That's more admirable than many of the other "decentralized" coins out there, for example Ethereum, which didn't hesitate to do a hard fork of the coin to recover lost ETH tokens that a hacker took in the DAO disaster, or the minority Bitcoin core developers who completely control Bitcoin and do disastrous softforks and attempt second layer solutions like segwit and LN.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:02:50
Where'd you come up with that formula lol
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:52:13
It only pays lip service to socialism. When it was incredibly socialist back during Mao the great leap forward killed around 30 million people. After Deng Xiao Ping abandoned it for capitalism then the country started to prosper.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:45:55
It's too late already. Other cryptos have already filled in the void and are working with vendors and banks and FIs actively fielding enterprise-ready products.
Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:35:00
They didn't reject gold or any alts after accepting it. Bitcoin is a disgrace 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:03:34
Ripple can process 1500 tx/s with $0.0001 fee and almost instantaneous confirmation times. No version of bitcoin could do that
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:53:41
So edgy. This kid will be crying and beggin the price to go up if it just falls below 10k. At 1k he'll probably hang himself.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:46:02
All the people holding his bags right now and not selling hoping for a higher price paid for his med school.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:56:39
Why would they suffer low reward when they can just raise the transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:17:55
It instills more faith than Steam dropping Bitcoin, that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:14:23
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:35:26
We already have good stores of value. We have gold, silver, real estate, art, treasury bonds etc. What we don't have is a good currency that is cheap and instantaneous.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:44:19


I do, it's just that Bitcoin is terrible for it, and other alts do it MUCH better. When other coins can be a better store of value AND a better currency at the same time, there is no need for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:35:21
Are we supposed to just ignore the fee issue then? These 'shillings' are based on reality
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:17:12
It won't strike. Segwit adoption is at 15% and falling.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:37:40
tl;dr    PLEASE KEEP HOLDING THE BAG.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:31:36
Yes. Use GDAX to avoid fees and then move bitcoin to Binance or Gatehub and exchange for XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:11:33
you can't. It's slow as shit and the fees are too high. And why would I use it when it will go up tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:15:58
Lots of facebook contenders among the 1300+ other cryptos out there. It's only a matter of time. Especially among the top 20 coins.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:48:57
Bitcoin is gambling at this point, and all of us are being manipulated by wallstreet.
Bitcoin is owned by the banks and china.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:51:40
well shit. Fuck Bitcoin then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:14:29
Keep holding that Bitcoin bag as it continues to slip.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:44:04
wow, so this is how bitcoin has degenerated into. Scared people talking trash about other coins instead of welcoming competition which will be good for Bitcoin.
**This is good for Bitcoin.**
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:18:46
Trying desperately to convince yourself huh? Keep holding that btc bag.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:26:39
How is bitcoin the future when it's tech is shit? It's slow as fuck and the fees are too high.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:22:06
When is it going to be implemented? And how is it going to be implemented since it needs Segwit to work and segwit implementation is only at 15% (and falling)?
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:51:53
I'm glad you see the light :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:28:42
Yea, because I'm the guy worshipping a coin controlled by chinese miners in unsecure warehouses, who don't implement segwit because them and the exchanges love high fees. 
Hey, I'll woship centralization all day long if that's the alternative.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:39:59
Really? care to explain? What happens to bitcoins when all the miners switch over to another coin? That's what I thought.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:57:24
That's not even enough to cover the transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:54:26
But evolution is "survival of the fittest" :( What I fear happening is that Bitcoin will be wiped out like the dinosaurs while the other coins evolve to survive and thrive...
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:52:01
Sell when you can.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:11:30
Bitcoin with its hours long transaction times, sky high fees and chinese centralization is what's keeping the price down, you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:57:24
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:03:36
Why would they implement segwit? Miners and exchanges love high fees. It's more money for them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:04:35
Did you not read what I wrote? It is already pre-mined. They need to do a hard-fork to creat new coins. It's not like Ethereum where they can just continue to create ad infinium because there's no cap.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:17:42
So Bitcoin is owned by banks now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:54:05
The solution is already here and it's called Bitcoin Cash, just as Satoshi intended.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:47:41
So the same as holding on to bitcoin when it slowly bleeds value?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:39:38
It think it's congested from the increased speculation filling up the 1MB ceiling.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:17:07
I think as initial investors get more educated and the smart institutional money starts coming into the cryptomarket, Bitcoin will start to stagnate and then slowly drop in price.
Right now Bitcoin only really has hype and its name to offer to investors. No real value. And smart people know that. They will flock to other coins which has actual value like Ethereum or Ripple.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:18:00
damn, are you a bitcoin millionaire?
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:17:41
oh ok cool :D
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:44:27
Sell now while you can.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:30:51
Ripple can scale to 56,000 ts/x which is visa level. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:33:01
Did you not read the next sentence? Miners will maintain high fees forever, since that is their revenue source, and as user leave the system because of the fees the miners will leave too because the fees are getting lower.
And 'Without an alternative way to maintain the miners, the system will collapse.'
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:46:00
It increases income inequality? Since it is transferring wealth from the poor/middle class who wants to strike it rich to the pockets of the wealth who owns most of bitcoin and can manipulate pumps and dumps.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:37:35
I don't doubt Bitcoin will still be here lol. It'll just be worth like $100 and be a novelty coin. Kind of like a piece of history you can own. :D
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:51:27
It solved scaling? It can scale to more tx than visa. From Ripple's website:


Ripple is instant, unlike Bitcoin which takes hours and days.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:26:07
Everything that the community is doing now (promoting endless price increases) is turning bitcoin into a ponzi and encouraging its failure, not success. All of this meanwhile other platforms are innovating so quickly.
The whole point of bitcoin was instantaneous, almost no-fee transactions anywhere in the world, plugging the world's poor into the world economy. It's now become a pump and dump by wallstreet speculators. What happened?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:36:47
What tech or real world use? It's been all about getting rich quick ever since it reached like 800 dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:05:15
Buy high Sell low
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:56:15
Better than Bitcoin apparently, since Ethereum handles more transactions than bitcoin and it's faster and cheaper than it is. Coins like Ripple and BCH is even better.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:04:29
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:03:15
This is a terrible advice. You should never invest more than you can afford to lose, and just because it has always gone back up that doesn't mean this time is the same too. Do your own research.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:45:20
Already have enough of crypto I trust that'll get me to millionaire status :) but thanks haha 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:44:21
Thank you for holding the bag!
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:59:58
has turned into Fox news and the_Donald of the cryptoworld. It's a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:12:13
The miners set the fees and then the users have the option to accept or not accept. And when they don't accept then their transactions don't get processed or keeps getting moved to the back of the queue. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:19:11
lol this kid is so mad. You're not even a millionaire, go cry in a corner.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:22:22
Why are you gambling on something that has no intrinsic value?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:06:20
That is quite the prediction.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:02:03
oh it's unfortunate that you are being sarcastic. I thought it was painfully obvious how outdated Bitcoin and co was... but ok. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:26:10
Indeed, that +50% to 14k, and dropping still.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:18:57
GG no RE. Bitcoin might die soon.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:49:40
You're just made because you're left holding his bags and paying for his med school
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:08:10
It is a real crypto. Get your head out of your ass. It's eventually going to overtake Bitcoin as first place.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:28:02
It's a ponzi scheme at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:58:26
Bitcoin is centralized. Chinese mining pools own more than 51% of the hashrate.
Ripple is turning off its own validator for every 2 independent validator it adds. Soon it'll be even more decentralized than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:25:21
Yea Im pretty sure.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:51:37
Yea I think Bitcoin is going to languish from now on and continue to lose marketshare until it becomes a niche collectible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:37:06
Unfortunately that's where bitcoin is at the moment. If you want low fees and instant transactions I recommend Ripple XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:33:45
How about you inform me why you think Bitcoin is better than bitcoin cash? I'm not even an avid supporter of BCH, but I have to admit they've stayed slightly more faithful to the great vision that was Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:28:19
Is Roger Ver all you people talk about? How about you stop obsessing over him and solve scaling and fee issues making Bitcoin into a useless token?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:08:28
As investors become more educated and smart institutional money (who actually does research) comes into the crypto market, Bitcoin will pretty much plateau and then start to stagnate in price going lower and lower since Bitcoin only had hype and the Bitcoin name to offer.
The money will flow into other coins like Ethereum and Ripple which offers real products and value.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:56:09
Yea I know. Bitcoin is just running on its name and the hype alone at this point. It'll soon be overtaken by ETH, BCH, and XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:30:49
If LN W
was implemented at a 100% two years ago maybe. Now altxoin is lightyeats ahead of Bitcoin and too entrenched to ever die. Theyll surpass Bitcoin and if bitcoin doesn't improve soon it's the one that's going to die in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:07:27
We'll have to see
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:39
XRP is actually aiming to be even more decentralized than bitcoin, with taking a validator offline everytime 2 new independent validators coming online.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:27:01
you mean $14.5k?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:51:33
This is what they're doing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:57:56
I read the original satoshi white paper. And the current Bitcoin doesn't follow it. That's why I said it's a store of value now, not a currency. And that's what majority of people on here agree on, that it's no longer a functioning currency with it's scaling issues and ridiculous fees and transaction times.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:43:02
Why would miners ever support segwit if the fees will go to 0?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:52:43
because maybe it makes them less money and it sucks? Exchanges want higher fees not lower.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:30:44
You prove my point. Money is all you care about anymore. No, you probably only cared about money in the first place when you came across Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:33:45
Wasn't segwit supposed to do that?
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:33:35
Bitcoin is one of many crypto, it's not going to take all the maketshare. In fact, it's dominance is dropping below 50%, probably below 40% in Jan of 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:00:37
lol $4 is cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:04:37
Wow you really showed them!
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:14:00
how is it bullshit? you want stability and even lower prices to bring down crazy confirmation times and tx fees. This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:26:07
It's going to be all variants of the Bitcoin brand. Obsolete.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:54:58
OP. He's secretly selling while telling everyone else to HODL. Yea, more like HODL his bags while he takes off like a bandit with your money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:09:13
You realize that you can also buy ethereum, litecoin, ripple, BCH with fiat right? And that they have tons of trading pairs? You don't have to buy Bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:14:08
They said the same thing with Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:08:07
fees will rise. they will be even higher than they are now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:27:03
This guy is the real bag holder right here.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:21:13
Please don't try to make SODL happen. HODL is bad enough.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:47:57
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:40:05
That's why they are afraid, since it's been pretty stagnant since the futures trading started.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:55:56
Translation problem? Because Im pretty sure they want to regulate Bitcoin trading because the government identifies it as unrestricted gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:01:55
lol someone's jealous he's poor.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:04:09
suckered in? Are you suggesting that Bitcoin is in someway a scam/ponzi?? how dare you
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:44:55
ok, remind me in a few hours
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:00:04
XRP is a smart choice! :D What made you make that decision to switch over?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:00:40
indeed. It's pretty much the worst out there.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:57:47
Yea actually. Bitcoin right now has just degenerated into a ponzi scheme. ETH, BCH, and XRP is going to overtake it in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:08:25
Let's agree, to disagree. But I get what you're saying
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:34:55
You mean secondary and tertiary layers like segwit and lightning that are useless and pathetic? Bitcoin is doomed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:42:09
lol people are mad because they're scared. More competition is good. **This is good for Bitcoin**.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:26:38
Says an oligarch, a CEO.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:41:25
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:43:24
What don't you understand? Bitcoin is purely based on hype it's perfectly natural for people to dump it when that hype is drying out. Bitcoin isn't based on offering actual useful products like other crypto are, so people will dump.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:16:53
I predict 2k by the end of 2018
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:17:03
Hey guys, I'm selling my bitcoin for fiat and then buying things, and also I'm not even on-chain, but I'm totally using Bitcoin everyday to buy things. Totally not delusional!
Is this guy serious right now?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:25:02
Jeep Hodling the bag guys, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:14:43
As long as BCASH is falling harder I don't care if BTC is falling hard either. Is this what you're saying? Because BCASH will probably regain all the loss and go higher while BTC will languish at 14k and steadily drop into the 13s...
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:40:01
Who are these 6 saboteurs and the patent troll you speak of? Are you somehow accusing the BCH community and their leader of trying to deliberately sabotage Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:55:00
Echo chamber over here.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:14:03
Ah the delusional, my favorite bag holders :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:02:36
My argument is that people here are delusional and blind to what bitcoin has become. A literal useless niche item/ponzi scheme. I was being sarcastic. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:20:45
Good job! Gotta take care of family first, what is money for :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:05:41
but when is LN going to be deployed? Segwit has been deployed for such a long time but nobody is using it. Won't LN end up in a worse situation if it actually depends on segwit to function?
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:14:40
More to add to your list:
* 1hr to couple of days to weeks transaction times.
* exorbitant transaction fees from $5 to $40 and more.
* Centralization by chinese miners, domination of hashrate of upto 61%.
* Centralization and domination by a single company (blockstream)
* Unable to buy anything cheap and affordable like a cup of coffee or bread due to fees and transaction/confirmation times.
* Steam drops BTC because it's an inferior system, business adoption is in the negatives.
* Segwit adoption is at 15% and falling.
* LN has been promised for 2 years now and still isn't implemented.
* It's terrible for the environment and a single bitcoin transaction now uses more energy than an entire household uses in a year.
* The entire network uses as much electricity as the nation of Denmark. Bitcoin is probably speeding up global warming, literally killing the planet.
Did I miss anything? Hope those help.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:01:03
That's true, the bitcoin name may soon be equated with outdatedness and uselessness.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:47:57
Use Ripple. It's better than Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:04:07
Bitcoin is only valuable because of it's name, and that's all mom and pop have heard of. Something that doesn't have real utility will surely die.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:24:20
because it's a shitty currency?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:24:46
Sell while you can.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:47:40
Thanks for holding the bag!
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:05:56
$15 transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:55
lol why would I be mad I'm richer than you. Keep holding that Bitcoin bag I'll see you at $1k BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:45:00
I think that fact is pretty obvious.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:58:30
Ripple already does more transaction per day than Ethereum or Bitcoin combined and it can natively do 1,500 tx/s and can scale to 50,000 tx/s.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:00:35
Uh... ok
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:10:01
If segwit and LN is so revolutionary and make bitcoin better, then why are we always begging for it? Shouldn't exchanges and miners want to install al it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:55:17

You fool....
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:22:50
First of all, congratulations on the boobs.
Second, I'm here because I love Bitcoin, or what it used to be. It's become nothing more than a get-rich-quick scheme. Half the posts are HODL posts, Steam just rejected Bitcoin, and everyone is excited about wallstreet opening up a futures trading for bitcoin. Wallstreet. It is insane.
Fast, cheap, anonymous transactions. That was the goal. What happened?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:32:42
Ok, good luck. you're going to need it.

Those poor employees are going to lose alot of money in fees when they try to use it to pay bills and such
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:09:17
Yea, bitcoin is still very much gambling. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:25
He's just trying to blaming BCash to distract you from Bitcoin's failures. Trump uses similar tactics of blaming illegal immigration for lack of jobs in coal towns.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:32:46
yea people on this sub are basically bitcoin climate change deniers.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:13:41
Make sense since you'll be paying for that second Whopper with the transaction fee.
I guess Burger King is trolling.

I'll check those out, thanks~
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:23:00
lol Bitcoin is dead. The myspace of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:13
it wont get fixed.

Their fortune isn't over a billion anymore after the crash.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:40:10
how is it a joke? it does everything bitcoin tried to do (and failed) better. Got a reason other than the uneducated "it's centralized so it doesnt count" excuse?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:55:20
Don't tell other people what to do. It's their Bitcoin and they can do whatever they want with it. They have other priorities in life other than waiting it out for a possible $1,000,000
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:56:24
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:08:02
Exactly my point.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:29:37
Government will regulate whether you like it or not eventually
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:38:28
But bitcoin has the same problem. We can't use any of it except going through greedy middlemen (Chinese miners and Exchanges) that take their expensive cut (Steam quotes $0.20 to $20 transaction fees). The ease of use in the case of being a SoV isn't very important since you are parking your wealth there longterm, not trying to day-trade it to try to make a profit.
I'm not being short-sighted. I'm just stating facts and reality. Bitcoin is lagging further and further behind and once it is done being manipulated by Korean speculators and big banks to squeeze regular people out of their money, it might get left out to dry while other alts are surging ahead with their market adoptions. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:37:40
But bitcoin doesn't work. That is reality. It's time you saw it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:13:22
Hey mr. pizza guy, can you just wait for a week? The fees are too high right now at $20, let me get back to you when its $3.
But I need to get paid right now...
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:56:42
Bitcoin is not decentralized. The majority of hashpower is controlled by Chinese miners who can do whatever they want.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:14:37
haha me too
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:12:13
Bitcoin is now owned by wallstreet. What are you so mad about, you're small fish you don't matter.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:12:08
This makes no sense, almost every other crypto out there has better tech and use case than bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:49:46
Utility? What utility?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:23:06
Is this guys serious? Did you not see the Steam announcement 2 days ago?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:55:20
Yes, because that's totally how analogies work. Literally...
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:21:55
mom and pop can't buy expensive art, or even fractions of art. They can with Bitcoin tho. That's how you know it is in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:38:49
Why, so you can cash out with their money and leave them holding the bag? F that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:42:39
Sell now while you can. Bigger crash incoming.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:14:52
This guy is tell people only to spend bitcoin when the fees are low, and not buy everyday items like pizza. Also tell us regular people to buy art on sotheby's.
Get the fuck outta here. Bitcoin is shit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:04:40
So you lost 2.6% of the total value by just initiating a transfer? That is god-awful.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:46:02
why do you think that?
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:46:39
Let's raise taxes and give free schooling to all! :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:34:21
Because I want to be rich? If I'm investing into something and it has no utility so nobody uses it and it dies, then there goes my millions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:21:00

Stop trying to get everyone to waste their money.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:08:43
Don't buy on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:44:20
Just because people are not in the game yet, doesn't mean they will? He gives every other reason for BTC's rise instead of the one that actually matters: can it actually function as a currency and can it out-compete the dollar as well as other alts? The answer right now is no.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:09:43
if they ban exchanges bitcoin will die because 99% of volume would be gone,  bitcoin price will plummet and miners wont make money anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:13:38
lol this. So we can all go back to being optimistic again is what you're saying? XD
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:56:47
You want more coins that are slow as shit and have high fees? Why?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:08:11
The wife is always right. She'll hold this over your head forever.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:54:55
Millennials don't have the money to invest in bitcoin. Those buying now are still the babyboomers. You're still owned by your parents, in the real world as well as cyberspace.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:00:57
So edgy. Keep holding that bag you'll work at McDonald's for the rest of your life.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:08:33
How embarrassing...
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:00:17
Because it will impact fees and the miners like high fees?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:10:26
yea let's just watch as all the whales take our money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:31:39
Why is Bitcoin controlled by Core and Chinese miners instead of the community?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:12:52
XRP like: im faster, cheaper, and wayyyy better than u bitcoin I dont give a fuckkk
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:34:25
That's what Bitcoin will be in the future.  A novelty coin worth $100, a piece of history that you can own.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:07:44
Why does it matter? Bitcoin and crypto is gambling so you shouldn't be putting your savings or your mortgage into this in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:13:57


@_date: 2017-12-28 14:40:48
? I'm helping OP for his paper? Hello?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:34:43
Hell yea. Go XRP!
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:59:36
I believe the HODL mentality goes against everything bitcoin ever stood for. But I guess now Bitcoin only stands for making money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:31:12
Thanks for holding the bag
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:47:36
Don't bring your momma into this!
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:51:29
People are attacking you because you actually decided to cash out instead of holding the bag to continue the Ponzi scheme. 
You made their bitcoin price go down, you scumbag!
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:08:04
Proof that he's basically milking bitcoin as much as he can while he makes as much money as he can, before moving on to another asset he can milk.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:20:20
Not if you slowly bleed out while holding the bag
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:36:15
It means that Coinbase likes to make money, and that it will support more cryptos next year to make even more money. Coinbase isn't an BTC ETH LTC exclusive.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:45:52
You get your blind BCore following out of here.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:29:23
Not really, the upvotes are slowly going down. Which indicated decreasing interest.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:36:22
No I'm not really confusing anything. I'm not saying Bitcoin is a company. But success for a company can be compared to adoption of a cryptocurrency, since both equate to survival. And Bitcoin has a very slim chance of success with what it has to offer. At best it will be adopted by the market as a speculative instrument designed to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich through a get-rich-quick promise. That's pretty much what it has dwindled down to from 2010.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:05:45
Hey guys, let's keep Bitcoin shitty and unusable so we can keep trying to sustain this price increase until it crashes and bitcoin literally dies. Stop asking for an actual currency we can use.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:33:46
XRP is the shitcoin? BTC is the shitcoin more like with its terrible confirmation times and sky high fees..
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:06:17
like 30% of all volume for crypto comes out from South Korea. It's taken the nation by storm. That's why.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:05:09
880k... LOL. Get on my level. Prepare for that to slowly go down with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:45:43
I mean that's why 99% of people are in it for anyways. Let people do what they want with bitcoin. It belongs to all.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:20:58
Not really, just seeing reality. You're the one blindly cheering for Bitcoin because you put $100 in to it hoping it'll go to a million.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:46:49
are you saying Bitcoin is a scam/ponzi? how dare you
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:40:24
It is a success story if you wanted the price to rise, but it is an utter failure if you wanted Bitcoin to actually scale and become a somewhat ok currency.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:16:36
Exactly, so this system just encourages higher and higher fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:44:11
Isn't Bitcoin controlled by Chinese miners tho?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:32:57
But doesn't Bitcoin take hours to confirm as well? And with even heftier fees than a bank transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:20:51
you gonna give us an update or what?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:22:43
A sad, poor excuse for why Bitcoin doesn't work, and how you shouldn't use it if you can't afford it.
tl;dr  Bitcoin is only for rich people like me!, and poor people who can't afford it should just 'wait' and use it when they've fixed all the problems (when will this be? Wasn't bitcoin supposed to be a coin for the masses, the very poor, even those that live on $2 a day?) 
Bitcoin is dying and it'll be overtaken by altcoins next year, and it'll be a novelty. December 2018 people will still be crying about Segwit and LN and the transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:03:39
Where were you when China banned their exchanges over night?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:29:10
Bitcoin is more centralized. It is owned by a few Chinese mining pools without any oversight and acting however they wish. They don't care about Segwit or Lightning or the 250k unconfirmed transactions, high fees or Steam dropping Bitcoin as a payment platform. They don't want to improve Bitcoin, because they are happy with the status quo collecting high fees and selling expensive bitcoins.
But ok, enjoy paying exorbitantly high fees to them trying to use Bitcoin. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:12:51
Yahoo? The company that barely exists right now? You'd probably don't want him anywhere near bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:29:55
No, you're here for the price. Because if you're here for some financial blockchain revolution you would've moved on to another coin that actually works as currency by now, not supporting this fee scheme to enrich chinese miners that control bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:10:25

2 weeks later: It's still up 55% from the last week guys calm down
3 weeks later: We're still good we're up 20% this month that's better than the stock market
6 weeks later: We're down 15% from last month but it's ok just buy the dip
1 year later: Why didn't I cash out at 19k it's at $1000 right now...

Nobody knows when it will happen. If you ask me personally, and I am no expert (I do hold around 6 bitcoin and I plan to buy more), the market WILL rebound, but not for a few months, or even years. Not that it matters to me, because I plan to hold around 10-20 btc for a few decades. If you are making money on day trades, bitcoin is really not for you. You should hold until prices rise so you can get out of the market with money you came in with, or just get out right now. You should not be speculating on bitcoin at this stage of its development. Wait a few months for the prices to rise, SELL IMMEDIATELY when it's risen enough to cover your initial investments (DO NOT WAIT FOR IT TO GO UP ANY FURTHER THAN IT HAS TO) and then cash out and never buy bitcoin ever again.

Coinbase. You don't have to buy an entire bitcoin,  you can buy any fraction of it as your budget allows. And I don't know what you mean by starting a bitcoin business. If you want to get into it just buy some and spend it instead of fiat money.

If I may, please just forget about your bitcoin holdings for a few months. Check the prices but dont trade in it. Continue to trade in other currencies and make profit, but hold what you have in bitcoin right now and just check the prices. Bitcoin is in a downward trend right now and to recover the prices at where u came in it will likely take a few months to even years. You can't stress yourself over bitcoin everyday. You need to just leave it be and continue making money in other currencies.

I would not invest (gamble) in crypto if I was in your situation, where that money you are using to buy bitcoin might be needed to literally sustain you if you lost your job or an emergency happened in the family.

It was neither dumb, or smart, since nobody here or anywhere can predict where the price was gonna go. It was just gambling.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:04:13
At this point the only reason people hold BTC is to speculate and hope the price skyrockets further making them rich. It's digital gold now, sitting there pretty and not doing anything.
For actual practical exercises, like sending money instantly with little to no fees, people use litecoin, XRP, Eth, etc. Anything but Bitcoin.

Somebody is scared
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:12:16
I think buying Bitcoin in the hopes of striking it rich will make a cypherpunk reality that much harder since, for that reality to occure, Bitcoin actually has to be used to buy goods and services, not hoarded in hopes of higher prices and passed off into the hands of the next hodler who's just going to hoard it as well, hoping for higher prices.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:24:56
I just hope that price discovery happens soon and doesn't get lost in all the speculative fervor. Otherwise Bitcoin might lose out in the end.

@_date: 2017-11-30 15:34:11
That's not what it means at all. The vast majority of people buying bitcoin don't see bitcoin as a way to get rid of the government or the banks. They're not using bitcoin for that purpose. They're using it to just make a profit. It's like saying you're buying Apple stock in the hopes of establishing a world wide Apple government, when in reality you're just buying it as an investment/speculative vehicle in order to make more money.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:55:39

@_date: 2017-11-30 14:22:04
Man that's not that much. Let's be honest, most of us into Bitcoin don't give a shit about Bitcoins or overthrowing the banks or the government. They love fiat and the banks and just wants to be rich.

Etherium has replaced bitcoin. Goodbye, bitcoin.

To the moon!

No this will not happen. Let's be honest.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:44:43
Bitcoin is pathetic.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:00:00
 Smell the bacon and wake up fool. Unless bitcoin Forks and fixes itself, it's dead in the water.  
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:36:54
Better than Bitcoin, which is run by unelected and communist Chinese miners who are only after profit...
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:13:10
$0.26???? 30minutes???? That fucking sucks...
@_date: 2017-06-26 05:32:26
What do you mean, I can be wherever I want to be.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:27:23
you fool...
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:31:24
You guys destroyed bitcoin when you basically sold out to Chinese miners and handed them the keys to the kingdom. Don't act all innocent now that you are reaping what you sowed.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:54:33
People settling for crap since they're so invested in Bitcoin and can't afford to have it fail... that's what it is.

I think the 'why' was already implied in the way you've described by the LA Times labeling it as a currency, which is a form of credit used in payment systems. So the LA times got it right.

So is this the same thing as the more we are indoctrinated in one thing, the more we can't help but believe in it?

Give the rest of the money that's left to your sister. That's her money and you blew all your share on bitcoin. You didn't really need to seek advice on this matter at all.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:12:08
Am I the only one who thinks that the total available volume of bitcoin is too small compared to other currencies to be used effectively to buy and sell items at a stable price? It is and will always be used only for speculation.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:28:15
why would she want to split the 150k with you, when all the money left now should be hers? You blew your half away on bitcoin with your gambling problem, so stop now before you blow away her share too and give her the money.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:45:26
very possible. If the US government follows the way of China and bans exchanges of USD to/from Bitcoin, bitcoin will die.
