Bitcoin(dot) com needs to be reported. We owe it to the general public to report this site for the misleading load of mess it is.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:30:22
This is me. And somehow I always click the buy button on the peak,  literally 30 seconds before it tanks 1000USD.
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:11:44
99% of people in SA use the exchange and app - LUNO. Bitcoin LUNO to LUNO is free, so there is no fees at all.

Break out mid August!  (I hope!)
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:04:53
South Africans pretty much all use the exchange LUNO ... transferring LUNO to LUNO is free. So there will be 0 fees.

I dont have the confidence to hold my own keys. Would opening a coinbase account just for storing BTC be safe enough?

I'm keen
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:13:26
Same man. I'm stuck at at an average of about 7600. Crazy thing is I started buying at 4K.... but small amounts. As the price got higher, I started buying bigger amounts.... end up I over doubled my average buy in at one point.
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:56:33
'dead babies' Ver.  You made me LOL when I read that. So an upvote for you.

Etoro as a place to buy and sell stocks is ok.  Don't like their copy  trading as it is a bit dodgy. Anyone can be copied, and Etoro promotes a  trader who makes gains - but soon as that person looses your money,  another trader making gains is recommended in their place, and so the  cycle continues, they now constantly have you chasing, all the time  while collecting fees - that's the money making machine that is  etoro.  XRP Also has a massive grip on this platform. If you say  anything negative about XRP you can get banned. They are so serious  about XRP that I feel that XRP/Etoro must have some kinda of business  relationship.  Overall its an ok platform, just avoid the problem area's  mentioned. As stated on Etoros front page 76% of people loose money on  etoro, so its not easy to make money there. Their goal is to get u on  the hamster wheel and keep you there.

Strange. They are the only wallet I trust. My local exchange was hacked twice with funds lost - so i switched to samourai.  I've used it for the last year, with no issue.   Recently I got android studio, downloaded the code from github and started tweaking my own version it, just to prod and poke it - though I only keep my funds in their official build. I  trust this project. Also the developers are reachable.. if you have an urgent issue - just go into their telegram and you can speak directly to a person on the project team.
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:33:57
Can somebody confirm... does the halving, in general, mean doubling of the production cost?  (All other factors being equal)
@_date: 2019-06-18 03:52:48

Nobody has given a great answer. Bigger blocks are a security risk, as its possible to fill this huge blocks with bogus transactions, then let the network strain to validate it. Smaller blocks are faster and invalid transactions and blocks are rejected faster. This is 1 of the many reasons Satoshi wanted a 1mb block size.
@_date: 2019-12-27 04:09:14
Dude... you use the bitcoin logo to give yourself credibility while making vids on shitcoins. Personally I don't think your sort of content helps the bitcoin community at all.
@_date: 2019-12-10 02:03:09
I guess I am the only person who sees this as semi-reasonable. They are a 3rd party and they are carrying your risk, hence they have some policy and process to mitigate it. Purchase your coins on Coinbase. Just don't store them there, get Samourai Wallet for android, or any other option, then the risk is on you, and no more delays.
@_date: 2019-04-17 09:01:42
I see BCH as a complete scam.  His website tries to scam people to buy ver's altcoin.

@_date: 2019-04-28 02:54:10
I don't trust this.  And zcash is a scam.

PLEASE be a bear trap................. please please.....
@_date: 2019-01-31 06:38:48
Firstly , get your transactions id's, or its usless posting your problem here. Just search for you  the effected wallet id on blockchain dot info - then find the tx, and post them here.  Second, get your seed phrase, delete this electrum wallet.. Install samourai wallet - and restore your wallet with your seed phrase. Samourai will nicely list all your tx, so there should be zero problem.  It's impossible your fund are gone - that's the whole point of the block chain.
@_date: 2019-01-17 12:50:52

Litecoin is not traded on SA's no1 exchange, Luno. In SA most transactions would be done within the Luno exchange rather than on the blockchain, especially in the context of bars/restaurants, etc.
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:20:08
I LOL'ed
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:54:24
I entrust my bitcoins to them - it is a transparent, fully open source, all code open to the public on github - rock solid secure wallet. The dev's personality has no correlation on the code. If you find a problem with the wallet - put the java file and line of code on reddit to expose them.
@_date: 2019-05-20 04:24:36
Um bro... you can use the wallet totally fine, nobody is forcing anyone to connect to a full node over the internet......And the solution is already stated in your links. This issue on github makes it quite clear, its an advanced feature, for advanced users - it should be used securely and if a noob doesn't use it securely it could be a problem. Actually most software is like that.  Samrourai is not responsible for the Bitcoin Core RPC, that surely is coded by the bitcoin core team.  You can easily avoid using this feature - or use it securely. SIMPLE, DONE, FINISHED.  Nobody is being asked to do this as you claimed - so you are a liar -Yet you want to throw samourai under the bus.  If anyone was a paid troll....hmmm???
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:49:19
Digital currencies "like bitcoin" are not the future. Shitcoins are not investments. BITCOIN is the future.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:50:51
Samourai cannot steal your bitcoin. And they have never stolen anyones coins - it has NEVER happened - and it NEVER will happen. Please just get the github code - its a standard Java project - you can just download Android Studio from google.  METAZIP - Show me the line of code that steals bitcoins. SHOW IT me - OR you are just fake news.  Waiting for you.

@_date: 2019-05-19 10:41:39
No, I am not paid, and my reddit username could be used to check who I am, and I think you will find I have absolutely nothing to do with them. The wallet has some of the BEST privacy features of any android wallet.  You linked post does not provide any evidence against Samourai - its just a newb user speculating. YOU ARE FAKE NEWS.
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:30:54
Hi, yes. If you live in South Africa. You can pay your electricity bill at any supermarket that is using Payfast to settle bills. Payfast is a system for the payment of bills, telephones bills, doctors bills, general utilities bills etc. And Payfast, on top of cash, credit card, etc also supports bitcoin.  So yes, you can easily pay your  electricity  bill with bitcoin.

Bro im a developer .NET and Java at vodafone for over 15 years now. I tell you are talking nonsense .  Give me the line of code you are refering to. Don't make this accusation without giving the name of the class file, the method name of line of code.  nothing stops anyone from encrypting the content of an RPC call in my experience.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:28:17
What the hell am i talking about? I'm asking you to backup your statement by providing the security hole an samourai.  I want you to provide the link to the documentation where it warns that this RPC call is unsafe to use and a certain why - and the location in samourai's code where uses it. I think that is a fair request.   If you provide that too me - I will change my opinion, and consider  your opinion.

Pity to see scammers like Suppoman listed in there. Datadash let down his audience with consistently wrong predictions for the entire bear market - How can he be number 1 while making wrong call after wrong call - and shillings shitcoins like substratum which are totally worthless now. Tone Vays and The Moon I recon are quite good. Tone is experienced,  The Moon is a young kid - but he studies trading skills then applies it to the bitcoin charts with pretty good results.  The rest of those youtubers are just looking to spam content to get adsense revenue.
