The more sarcastic you get, the more i know you are back peddling. When facts and reason fail you retreat. the only point you were able to argue against, was Trumps net worth. And you couldnt even produce evidence to refute that claim. Youre a typical trumptard. you are so ready to believe in any echo chamber just as long as it doesnt make you think too hard. You honestly think you won an argument when you didnt even attempt to refute any of my original arguments. You also hypocritically critique my use of an ad hominem attack after you say that my post was cringy. I dont think you are cringy. youre fucking pathetic.

But that's only when the tech operates on a traditional block chain. Some like IOTA's tangle wouldn't change transaction costs due to traffic. I'm not suggesting that Iota is the answer, simply using it as an example of when high demand != high cost.

There's questions about whether it's even millionaire. There's no confirmation that he has billions. Only his word and his own lawyers admitted that he lied constantly.

No one knows the answer to that question. It's unlikely that an commodity, currency or object will increase in value constantly. There will never upset and their will be downs. The price has done it in the past. This is a volatile market and it's unlike anything we have ever seen before. Using our traditional modeling tools to predict the crypto market is like using a sextant to navigate to Mars. If you believe that years in the future this currency will have value then there is no wrong time to invest. If you think it's just a passing craze that will deflate in a few years then there is no point in investing at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:59:30
In reality, bitcoin futures will start trading on the 10th. This could either make the price go up or go down. Lots of people have opinions but frankly no one knows.

150000000 in one year doesnt mean much when you owe billions in debt payments. The only one embarrasswd here is you defending how much money you think your "man of the people" as if that somehow makes up for the mountain of failures and short comings. His millions won't mean much when he's in jail.

Pricing goods in a currency that can fluctuate by +-10% in the time it takes to confirm a transaction is not easy. It's hard to budget the employees salaries, server upkeep and utility bills are in USD and bitcoin is constantly fluctuating. Is it possible? Yes totally but would it require more work? Yes. And unfortunately companies tend to work on thin margins and having full time crypto accountants might not make sense for them.

Is there a good explanation somewhere about bitcoin cash? Is it intrinsically bad? Is it only bad because they are "attacking" bitcoin? What does it mean to "attack" bitcoin? What is the bitcoin community's desired end game and what is bitcoin cash's? Why does bitcoin cash exist? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:41:33
I suppose so, but bitcoin has such a steep learn curve and barrier to entry I think it's pretty unlikely someone would accidentally buy the wrong one. And even if they did they could also switch

In academia, People with PhDs in economics, game theory and statistics can start to explain why historic jumps and dips occured in different markets. They the  develop models to explain these behaviors. These models might be simple. "When wages increase, money spent on investment increases". But life is pain and nothing is easy so usually the models are really complex and accounts for a number of factors. They test those models and verify that they predict history well. (enter the info from January 1985 and see if it accurately predicts the market in February of 1985). Once they have verified that it works. They can use that model on todays data to try and predict how the future will react.
On reddit, people just regurgitate shit they read in a comment, that was copied from another comment, that was paraphraseing some random post on another subreddit.

This isn't t_d, what we are building can't be built on hate and memes. If bitcoin cash is objectively worse and bad for the crypto scene then let's use objective arguments to prove that bitcoin is better. There is no need to let this degrade into a meta-ironic political debate. This is science and math and there powerful tools in this realm the vanquish lies.

@_date: 2018-03-14 21:08:53
Insecure is a spectrum. What I consider secure might be insecure to someone else. The DOD and the local pawnshop both consider their buildinging secure. But one is much more secure. Claiming that those are objective "lies" is part of the extreme language we should avoid. A better answer would be "the research and testing data suggests that segwit is secure enough to prevent problems.". Saying that it's a lie insinuates that you are an authority on the matter and that you know the objective truth on the matter. This is obviously false. This technology is relatively new so there are no certainties 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:39:25
Correct the Titanic was never risk free But the titanic was advertised as such. And now you are suggesting that a piece of software is 100% risk free. You dont think that anything could ever jeopardize the software. You mean to sit there and guarantee that, until the end of time nothing could ever possibly affect segwit security? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:11:15
I'm obviously not claiming that segwit has faults. I'm saying: "claiming with 100% certainty that a new piece of technology is 100% risk free" is an obvious overreach. Nothing is perfect and nothing is completely secure. We should be talking in sincere and accurate language not sarcastic half-answer copy-pastas.
