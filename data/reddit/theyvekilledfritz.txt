Dip means a fall in price. I used Coinbase because I'm new and it's convenient. You'll have to either submit your bank acct info for a higher buying limit (like $5K), or a debit/credit which is instant buy with a higher fee, and a lower limit (initial $200, but you can verify for higher like $500).
The bank acct is a lower penalty, and higher limit but, but it takes days for your bitcoin to show up in your wallet.
The whole set up can take roughly 20 minutes or so, maybe less. When you use he debit or credit, expect a fraud alert and purchase cancellation. Once you verify that the purchase was good, you'll have to rebuy your coins, which can suck because you lose that frozen value and it could rose (or drop, which would be good for you).
That's my 2 cents.
Also, I'm new as of 9/5 to all this.
Edit: typo

I regret now for waiting to buy later. Thought it would drop to 2800... oh well, maybe next time.

I signed up two days ago and got my .045 of a BTC... it was a little over $200. Not much, but I'm excited to be a part of this roller coaster!

I've been on the fence about Bitcoin for the last 4 years, and boy, do I regret it, so keep us posted when you dump so I can watch the price fall! I need to save up a little more cash before I start buying.

This is like an episode of Recess, "The Economics of Recess," where TJ works hard and basically hordes all the Monstickers in circulation. They become worthless, and everyone switches to a new Lick'n'Stick Alien Stamp.
