How is this a good thing for everyone else looking to transact on bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:48:11
This i agree with. Saying coinbase is a fraud and transferring to another exchange is just dumb. There is no regulation in this market and humans will do what suits them all the time....coinbase Gemini bittrex binance etc are not an exception to that rule

I'm sorry but that just sounds like the typewriter telling the PC in the 80s that I have a proven track record. I mean you just complained about transaction fees and the pain it inflicts so I'm really trying to understand what makes BTC better than BCH. I'll honestly switch to BTC in a heartbeat if the Tech was better than BCH.

Nah mate...I got in early on those bad boyz. I'm well up in the green for the year

 I can't wrap my head around it either. Surely there has to be a correction at some point
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:48:46
I trust coinbase with all my BCash. You are only saying this because you are butthurt....grow up child!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:24:37
Geeeezzz.....When will u guys leave him alone? My goodness! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:25:18
Y Not? What is a rational reason to continue to use BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:36:56
How do they steal coins?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:10:44
0 dollars. I entered crypto in October and after 1 month of research. I put my money into BCH when it was about 800 dollars. I like low transaction fees and Quick transaction times
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:18
Why are you leaving coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:05:57
I for one have all my money on coinbase. The sole reason that everyone is leaving is because BCH was adopted and that legitimizes the currency which makes a lot of BTC holders extremely salty. Do your own research man....follow the facts and come to your own conclusions. Forget what some people here are doing
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:06:26
There wasn't. I'm just holding because the price is rising and honestly that makes me happy but I'm also concerned about the applicability of the technology because the reason I got into btc in the first place was because I expect it to be the future way of transferring value but doesn't look like it's remotely close to being usable for that...hence my question 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:48:40
So basically..... what you are telling me is from my perspective as a consumer trying to transact in bitcoin, I'll be screwed due to the high fees. Why would I want to use that then? I could easily just transfer my money to Random altcoin and use that incentive. I mean what is the incentive for me to use bitcoin at that point?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:30:14
I could give a flying fuck about Roger Ver. I'm currently in both BTC and BCH because they are both making me money......simple!!!  
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:32:41
Very very silly.....Very childish. I mean the bitcoin with the best Tech will win at the end of the day regardless. I think the time taken to setup the block could have been spent in making these damn tx fees drop
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:17:58
You. Shouldn't. Have. Transferred. In. The. First. Place.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:19:00
But but but.....gemini!!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:04:12
Ohhh shut up.....I watched the interview too and I donbt see anywhere of him supporting insider trading. BCH is here.....stop being a cry baby and deal with it. Coinbase had given so much signs that they were going to be releasing BCH. If u paid attention and weren't caught up in your BTC bubble, you would have known as well
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:40:06
Perspiration ting
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:08:20
But.... I and most consumers just want to buy coffee and beer with it. Why do I have to pay $$$ in transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:13:50
I am Satoshi Nakamoto. Hear me people of cryptocurrency, Dogecoin is the one and only true bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:11:55
Switch to BCH
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:36:53
Cool story bruhhh
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:34:19
Not even going to lie by saying I'm enjoying this. I find it mind boggling that because of some stupid BCH vs BTC someone will go sell off their BCH immediately. Like wtf is wrong with these children? I bet on BCASH(yes I'm owning the name) to succeed and if I got my hands on BTC, I'll HODL that shit as well. People on here need to grow up
