"barrier to your enlightenment, your education, and your decency, is your culture. And I realise with joy that here I skirt the bounds of political correctness, because everyone is running around saying, you know, “Recapture your roots, get in touch with your Swedishness, your Irishness, your whateverishness”… and that’s all very fine, but I think it’s your humanness that may have eluded you in all this ethnocentric ?? 
Well, why should culture imprison us, and somehow place a barrier between ourselves and our true humanness? Well, I think I said at the beginning of this thing, culture and ideology are not your friends. They are not your friends. This is a hard thing to come to terms with, because a certain kind of alienation lies at the end of this thought process. On the other hand, you can’t live in the cradle for ever; you can’t be clueless for ever. So somebody might as well just lay it out for you, and say: Culture is for the convenience of culture, not you. How many times have your sexual desires, career aspirations, financial dealings and aesthetic inclinations been squashed, twisted, rejected, and minimised by cultural values? And if you don’t think culture is your enemy, ask the 18-year-old kid who is given a rifle and sent to the other side of the world to murder strangers if culture is his friend.
These extreme examples should bring it home to us that it’s a kind of a con game. It is in fact, strangely enough, a kind of virtual reality. We have been led to think of virtual realities as something on the screen of a computer, or presented through a headset, but that’s an electronic virtual reality. The primary technology for the building of virtual realities is language. Once you start talking about race pride, loyalty, our destiny, our God, our mission, it’s like building virtual realities; and people begin to treat these things as though they had the substantiality of real objects, and to build their lives as though these things are real. And what is this? It’s a diminution of humanness. You’re choosing to limit yourself to a cultural reality; whether it’s the reality of being Huitoto or Orthodox Jewish, or whatever it is, it’s a smaller world than the simple hardware you were born into this universe with."

What's your take on it? Credit cycle ending?

I don't think the watch would be big enough.

Yeah and so fucking what? 
Btc is voluntary, if you want to fork it you can fork it. 
Without other men I would be the most sought after bachelor on the globe. I'm not the only man out there, Btc isn't the only crypto.

I agree on all of these things, but who is dropping the petrodollar?
China shoots itself in the foot if the dollar is weak.

This will just drive up the price of crypto in that country. 
Btc has all the incentives just right. 
The best you can do is accept that it's here, but banning it backfires spectacularly.

You're absolutely right, and those things you mentioned will be, or are being turned into smart contracts. 
It's a matter of time.

I've seen way too many partnerships with Iota and German companies to believe they aren't going to fully embrace crypto in the near future.
They are being intentionally vague like the SEC because they know they can't prevent it, but outright embracing it would open the floodgates.

If you're being sarcastic, why do you think it won't?
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:14:02
I was just thinking how I'm going to just start paying for things in btc whenever possible..

Little known fact but toilets are also fiduciaries. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 02:39:11
Specifically what don't you like about Iota?
@_date: 2018-11-01 04:18:33
No, by the time the Fed chair "understands" the basics of btc he'll be promoting it, and it will be 1million or more. 
They trash talk it and buy it when it dips. Easy money.
