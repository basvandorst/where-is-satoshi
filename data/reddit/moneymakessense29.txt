I think you're over estimating, I'm the only one in my group who invested, my mom works at a big law office and no one even knew about bitcoin in Jan, you're being blinded by reading these subs thinking a lot of people still know about bitcoin

Honestly, I see a 1-2 year bear market, and guys like me who put money in each pay cheque that can afford to lose it don't worry, the people cashing out are the tards who took out loans and maxed out credit cards
