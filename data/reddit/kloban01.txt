Gold doesn't generate cash flow either, yet it's worth trillions of dollars. Obviously it isn't easily divisible/transportable; I think it's the utility, acceptance, and scarcity that gives BTC it's value.

That is exactly my point...Why would I spend them if they are going to be worth more next year and I can't replenish them if I don't have the liquidity to do so?
Edit: I want Bitcoin to succeed, but I am talking about the general economic principles behind it for the average Joe!
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:09:29
Oddly enough, I kind of agree with you, but I want to talk about deflation...
If the world was deflationary, all a government would have to do is not spend and then the money they have would be gaining value, but that wouldn't matter because then the economy would become weak! 
In order for a government to thrive, it needs inflation, but an economy also needs inflation to thrive.
If a government has a money with a lot of FUTURE value, no one wants to spend it. If no one wants to spend it, then it makes the economy weak. If the economy is weak then the government is also weak. 
Simple example:
Government has $1,000. Each year it deflates 3%, so the following year it now has a $1003 purchasing power.
10 tanks cost $1.
Government has $1000. Each year, it prints $3. Purchasing power erodes by 3% so it now has $997 purchasing power. 
10 tanks now cost $1.03. 
Sure they make up for the inflation loss via taxes, but inflation also incentivizes people to spend and lend and gives you and I a job.
 
This is the problem with Bitcoin as a currency. Many other facets have a huge value proposition but as a currency it sucks. If someone tells me they wan't to spend a money that is going to be worth 3% next year over a money that is going to be worth 3% less next year, then they're an idiot and the market would agree with me.

While the sample size is very, very small (maybe 30 people?) they averaged around ~$2300 at the end of the video. Granted, these are the people who know a ton about Bitcoin and it's potential. 
Now, let's say you grabbed 30 people off the street and asked them. I almost guarantee that 50% wouldn't know what you are talking about, and the other half would probably average to about $10, due to all the misconceptions, media blasting, etc. 
Given a sample size of 60 it comes out to ($10+$2300)/2 = $1155. Oddly enough, this is very close to this years high. There is a process called, Wisdom of the Crowd, where taking a collective opinion involving things like quantity estimation are usually highly accurate. I would definitely consider this quantity estimation. 
Again, it is a small sample size, but barring a 51% attack, I believe the price will be around $1000 end of year.
One other concern of mine is it's deflationary nature. Who wants to spend coins when they are likely worth more later, yet in order for the value to increase, it has to have increased use...
It has been an interesting experiment and I am really interested to see where we go from here! 
EDIT: Technically it would be 30+30+30 so ($0+$10+$2300)/3 = $770, but this doesn't take into account the investors with big money, which is disproportional. Still somewhere around the $800-$1000 prediction would be my guess.
@_date: 2014-06-10 06:26:31
Fair enough. Was not trying to insult, but I guess we can agree to disagree. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:42:12
I think most Bitcoiner's are very economically ignorant and blinded by their zealotry that they see no wrong in BTC. It's like dude - if something is going to be worth more the following year, why the fuck are you gonna use it if you can't replenish it or if you can, pay a fee and take a long time.
They might and a handful of anecdotal Bitcoin cutltists might replenish, but the market does not agree with you because it doesn't make sense at the current time - we need an incentive to spend as a consumer!  
Bitcoin has issues, and people should admit that, but I'm still long for now :)

"This pilot was instituted exclusively within the bank and participation was limited to 8 selected members of staff, Standard Bank said." 
So basically those who participated were supposed to use/test the system for an experimental currency but didn't do their job? Oh and 8 people? ... 8 people.

"There's no way that they'd make enough money off of double-spending to make the attack worthwhile."
Watch DJames D'Angelo video as OP said. He has some impressive arguments saying that $20 Million might be possible - especially if a government owns some foundries/colludes with a large business to take it down. 
Secondly, if a government feels threatened KEEPING the status quo is more than enough incentive to destroy the Bitcoin network! Even if it was 1 Billion dollars, that is pocket change for large governments.
Lastly, if a government was shorting Bitcoin on many exchanges at once while doing this, they might even be able to break even on the hardware...in addition to keeping the status-quo.
Any thoughts on this, or am I wrong? (Honest question!) 
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:32:32
Okay, I just skimmed and the part where it said Corruption/Money Laundering/Etc for Bitcoin is...negligible? 
That is pretty freaking ridiculous. 
What about Mt. Gox??? What about the thousands of people that have been scammed or had tens of thousands of Bitcoins stolen by hackers? 
Sure the protocol itself might be safe, but the security regarding HOW we exchange it needs to be improved by miles. 
To say negligible is lying. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:39:47
Pretty silly I think. Governments will attempt to ban it if they feel threatened. I know people will counter this by saying, "Bitcoin is anti-fragle yata, yata" but when you are government body with trillions of dollars at your disposal, anti-bitcoin Rhetoric and campaigns is going to be very easy to buy. 
Most people are dumb and don't trust/won't take the time to understand the complexities Bitcoin anyway, so the government already has a 1up if it starts to feel threatened.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:49:10
That is a big "IF" though. Not many people do own them. It takes a long time and a 1% fee just to purchase them. Why wouldn't a consumer use a credit card instead which will be 1.) faster 2.) won't have to pay the 1% fee to convert from fiat to BTC 3.) can get 1-3% cash back depending on what credit card is used. 
I love Bitcoin, but I am still confused how this is any good as a currency from a consumer point of view! 
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:47:40
I think it's convenience of being able to purchase Bitcoin easily from purse.io maybe?
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:40:16
This argument is also EXTREMELY flawed. I am going to flip this on it's head and come from the total opposite perspective.
Imagine if the best electronics that were ever going to be built in the world were built today, and only get shittier from here on out. 
What is going to happen to the electronic industry now that it is opposite of what you said? The electronics industry would do the best it ever has and GROW immensely. Same principle with the economy. 
When want over-rides price (different for each person) then people are going to buy no matter what, I agree. However, in a deflationary economy, that is going to have to now be an even larger want vs price to give up future gains. Make sense? 
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:22:52
This is actually a great exercise for me personally because it really makes me think about it! So thank you /u liquidify! 
Economies are all about efficiency. While you, me and a handful of avid Bitcoin community members may want to replenish, why would we from a monetary point of view? One anecdotal story or a few is not the market trend, and it is that way for a reason. 
Say you spent $1000 last year on 10 BTC and you purchased something today that cost 1 BTC, with a price of $575. Now, thinking that the price is going to go up, wouldn't you rather just save your BTC and spend the cash? 
One might argue, "well just buy the Bitcoin to replenish and use it"! Okay. So you go to Coinbase and they charge a 1% exchange fee. Alternatively, you could meet someone in person using services such as localbitcoins, but that usually increases the average exchange rate by 5 -10% for buying anonymity and whatever else. Not only are these options more expensive, but they also take a LOT more time. Since people (markets) attempt to be efficient, they seek to take the least amount of time and this poses a problem, in addition to being more expensive, people overall are going to avoid restocking. 
Another problem...Do you have the liquidity to replenish? Even if you had the liquidity to purchase it, why wouldn't you just pay using a credit card? Many credit cards I own have 1%, 2% and sometimes even up to 5% cash back in certain categories. Those are HUGE numbers in an economic system. I am not a fan of the banking industrial complex, and their monopoly, but it is a world we live in. 
There are many reasons NOT to spend your Bitcoin unless teh merchant is offering huge discounts (which I hope happens!) to make it worth a customer's time, but merchants don't want to give huge discounts as it is still speculative! Quite the conundrum, which I hope we break through!
In summation the biggest reasons NOT to spend:
1) The amount of time it takes to replenish.
2) 1% - 10% cost of buying BTC
3) You have the liquidity to replenish?
4) 1% - 5% cash back with a a credit card.
However, I do believe that Bitcoin is may be for a few things:
1) Store of value for the wealthy.
2) Gambling.
Maybe in the future we can break past these barriers, and I really am hopeful, but the deflationary nature is something I am concerned about! 
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:39:52
Here is an example I am thinking of: 
Say someone has a limited budget but they bought in at a price of $600 per Bitcoin. Let's also say that Bitcoin averages 2-3% deflation from here on out (just as an example).
Now, if he buys a car with Bitcoin, he doesn't have the liquidity to replenish the Bitcoin for many, many years so he is essentially losing 2-3% per year that he could have otherwise GAINED. 
If it is a deflationary currency, why would he use Bitcoin in this case? In fact, this incentivizes him not to spend, but to instead buy Bitcoin, hoard, wait for deflation to happen and never have to work again. This depresses economies. There are use cases (right now) as people are not sure where the value is going to go - or they have so many Bitcoin, they don't care, or they are enthusiasts, etc etc. If Bitcoin ever stablizes to 2-3% deflation per year though, people are less incentivized to spend as things will be worth more in the future.
Not only that, but I literally just saw a credit card offer that offers a 1%(?) cash off on a vehicle plus $1500 cash back...
The banks own everything and I am not thrilled about that, but at the same time, we haven't figured out how to combat it! 
There is value in Bitcoin, but as a currency, this is my biggest problem. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:48:04
I love Bitcoin. I think its a revolutionary technology, but it is still in it's infancy legally, politically and economically. With that said, I think Apple banned it to stay out of any sort of legal trouble, and that is aside from being a close minded/non-open source company. If you were any sort of businessman who was running a $400B company, you may do the same thing for a speculative technology, until Bitcoin became a substantial part of your market share. It's all about opportunity cost. 
They are a mega-cap company and in the short run, given the current market cap of Bitcoin, it may not make sense for them to get involved in something that could have larger legal ramifications at the present time.
I also don't think it is productive for the Bitcoin community to destroy their own property at a loss (why not sell it and just buy more Bitcoin(s)?). I also think the destruction of property promotes a negative image on Bitcoin in general and lord knows we already have enough ridiculous claims that ANY currency has to deal with (money laundering, supporting terrorism ,etc.)
Just my 2฿.

Regarding  - back in 2011, there was a flash crash. It took more than seconds, but it was literally minutes where it did lose 80%+ of it's value. 
Due to the liquidity, I believe it would be MUCH harder for that to happen now, but I think still possible. 
See video:
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:36:34
Okay let's say you have 10 Bitcoin (early adopter) and 3,000 USD in the bank each month. The whole point is, I am talking about if Bitcoin was stable and deflationary...why would you use it over a credit card/fiat?
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:31:44
Best reply I have ever seen on the argument.
I am not 100% sure that merchants will be incentivized to do 2-3% discount using BTC. If that were the case, why don't they offer a small incentive for cash deals right now? Sure, cash is inflationary, but it's at least a couple percentage points cheaper than credit cards! I really hope you are right in terms of adoption though!  
My other concern is if you don't have enough liquidity to replace your BTC. Example: You own 10 BTC today at $650, but only get paid $1500 per month. To make a large purchase, you'd want to use credit card/fiat right? What's your thoughts on that?
Seriously though man, by far the best response, eloquent and well written thought I have seen on the matter! 
@_date: 2014-06-07 03:03:24
Good point, but if you ask the average person about Bitcoin, they don't understand it and it takes some hard work to learn. It takes hours if not days to really grasp it.
Now if you pop a pill of Molly or do some heroin, the (feel good) effects are known immediately to the person, even without knowing the repercussions. Plus they are highly addictive physically and psychologically.  
Either way, hopefully there will be demand for it. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:53:29
I too have thought about this and it scares me because people make mistakes with the security of their own fiat money. As the price of Bitcoin rises, online and possibly offline theft will happen more and more and we need some innovation and security tool to protect the masses. 
It's a very interesting concept I have been thinking about a lot lately. For example, say that 2 in 10000 per year people get robbed of their Bitcoins in the scenario like you mentioned. That is DEVASTATING for their individual livelihood. Now if your money was stolen from a bank in the US, the bank and/or government will compensate you. This is one of the (many) reasons why the bank charges fees - to make up for fraud. 
This is why we will still need some sort of banking/reassurance institution if it is to ever go mainstream - to protect our money and for people to feel safe. I believe what will happen is new institutions (maybe the banks) will pop up and you will dump your Bitcoins into one of their wallets. They will then guarantee that your funds be held by them for an insurance premium percentage per year for holding it secure. 
This is a bit of a political question similar to healthcare in the US. Should everyone pay into a system that they will most likely never need, but protects the few individuals that get sick/hurt that would otherwise ruin them financially? Similarly, will people be willing to pay a premium for their money to be protected? 
In order for the Bitcoin to be widely accepted, people have to know (or at least believe) that their money is safe and why we need some sort of institutionalized security for the general public to accept it. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:21:22
Compared to the entire world market I meant. 2 Million owners vs 7.5+ Billion is a big "if". 
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:40:15
Example: I own 10 Bitcoin. With the price at $650 each, I have $6,500 worth in Bitcoin. I have $1,000 in my bank account. I spend my 10 Bitcoin to buy a car (roughly worth $6,500). Now that I spent my Bitcoin, I can't replenish them because I only have $1,000 in my bank account. This is the liquidity issue I am talking about.
If I think Bitcoin is going to be worth more the following year, I would not spend them and only use cash/credit cards...  
@_date: 2014-05-28 23:56:58
Ah okay. I didn't realize it was a hack. However, it did "appear" to lose it's value in this way, which could damage markets.

@_date: 2014-06-10 01:35:19
Why would you use Bitcoin if you think they are going to be worth more the following year and many credit cards offer 1 up to 3% off on purchases? If you don't have the liquidity to re-purchase Bitcoin, would you have bought the item still? (Serious question.)
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:37:45
Ah very true! Still, I feel a bit more "safe" going through a bank at this point in time. That could be based on irrationality (I don't have any data one way or anther) but over all, I am concerned about the safety compared to my bank account.
I am hoping security innovations will help everyone, with new tech, such as Trezor!

Was not trying to insult your intelligence at all, FYI. It's just that I used to have this stance as well (that Deflation is good) and started reading a bit of academia. Nearly every economic academic would agree with this. 
While it may be true that it has, "enslaved us" in the sense that we pay taxes, we do get an economy which gives you and I a job instead of an economy that goes into a deflationary spiral making it harder to find one.

If you wanted to buy a car, how are you going to replenish that many Bitcoins if you don't have the liquidity to do so? You are going to use dollars. 
Or, if you sign up for certain credit cards at the time of a car purchase you can get thousands cash back PLUS a 1-3% discount on the vehicle...this is the problem with Bitcoin as a currency. 
A person's want is now going to have to be that much higher since they are now forgoing something that they think is going to be worth more in the future...Deflation depresses economies.

I am a huge believer in Bitcoin - the protocol, the technology, and the limitless possibilities that can be built on top of the blockchain. However, the deflationary nature of it, it just really isn't a very good currency at the moment.  
Let me give you an example - why would anyone spend Bitcoin over using a credit card? Many credit cards I own have 1%, 2%, or even up to 5% cash back. Also, why would anyone spend something that is most likely going to have more value tomorrow?
There are many merchants who WANT It to work, but I am afraid the banks have a stranglehold on the merchants. Imagine a more extreme example: a payment processor that would GIVE merchants 1% on every transaction. What merchant wouldn't want this? 
The catch is now that all customers must pay 1% EXTRA at their store. It just won't happen. Demand will decrease at their stores, meaning less sales. Unless you already own a vast amount of Bitcoin that can be spent, it doesn't make sense to use Bitcoin...why would I spend with Bitcoin (aside from being an advocate)?

Please watch this video: 
The part that I would focus on starts at 8:35.
Basically focus on the FULL TRANSPARENCY for companies where we can see where all the money comes and goes! This allows everyone to make choices with what they believe is right for them politically, environmentally, etc. Then again, maybe the government won't like that.  
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:31:24
"Why do you think companies need to continue growing forever?"
I never said that 1, and 2 how is that relevant? It would be nice for companies to grow so people can have jobs though...
"Why do you assume the correct thing to do is force people (through inflation) to continue consuming things they don't need?"
No one is forcing anyone to buy anything. You think you deserve for your money to be worth more later for not doing any work?
"Are you aware that the US military has told the congress that they don't have a use for the tanks?" 
Yes, I just read about this - governments are corrupt. 
You're seriously acting like a zealot covering your ears and going, "La-la-la, I can't hear you". 
I'm meeting half way and hear what you are saying and understand that the government is corrupt. Of course. I understand that. How did they become so powerful? Yes, because of inflation like you said. That validates the point that inflation DOES make a strong economy thus making a government strong and why they choose it... 
I'm not saying the world is perfect, but a deflationary economy means that there won't be as many jobs to be filled and a weaker economy, as many leading economists believe. Period. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:30:50
Eh. Here is a scenario, not that I would do it...
Let's say I "buy" some stuff from a swap meet -  some really nice paintings, some jewelry etc. and the guy/gal took Bitcoin. You don't "remember" who you bought it from. 
Basically all you'd have to do for this "transaction" is put it in a new wallet.
Again, I would not recommend this, but I do believe there are loop holes...

Very true, yet that only reinforces my point. It will be heavily inflationary until 2024 when 99% of the Bitcoins have been mined, and the price has still exploded dramatically up until this point (at least over the last 4 years). So again, how can we obtain mass adoption when people don't want to spend it? 
Just a question for someone who is vested, yet looking for a good answer on this to ease my mind!
@_date: 2014-06-11 04:32:26
BitPay said they were processing something like $1 Million per day, which is awesome. Coinbase is probably somewhere near that mark as well. If you add up all the other small processors/transactions for goods and services, you'd probably only end up around $3-$5 Million. 
Now, look at the transaction volumes that have to change wallets from people trading. According to  the volume was about ~$22M in the last 24 hours. That means a good portion of the volume is just from it changing hands at this stage. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:55:19
Not a large sample size, so I guess that is somewhat surprising. However, a lot of the folks he asked seemed like young, educated, middle class men, so that demographic would likely be in touch with what Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 04:03:38
He says that the transaction volume is right above Western Union. The only reason for that is because of exchanges and people shuffling their own money around...not because of "real" transactions such as exchanging of goods and services. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 03:24:47
Haha instead of a rational answer, I get a downvote. Awesome
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:35:44
To my knowledge, Brawker only works if the market (people) are willing to buy and accept Bitcoin from their service at a higher price than the average rate of other exchanges. Since market's are efficient, people who want to purchase Bitcoin will naturally try to find a cheaper price. 
Even with 8% off, from a market perspective it still makes little sense why any individual would want to spend their Bitcoin if they appreciate in value every year. Just note that the equilibirum of wanting to spend needs to overcomes that of wanting to save and wanting to spend needs to be much higher in a deflationary economy, which is why a deflationary system is not good for an economy. 
Your value increases for doing nothing, thus incentivizing you not to work.

I read a study that for every dollar put into Bitcoin, the market cap goes up $50. I''ll see if I can dig it up.  
At the same time, in addition to the above, almost 365\*1800 coins have been mined since the all time high a year ago. That means that you'd need over $262MM to keep the price at the ATH of $20k...aside from manipulation, there is downward pressure for miners to sell to maintain profitability at that price.   
I am super eager to see where this will go, but I am believing up in the long run...but I have been wrong many times before in my life. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:42:11
My biggest issue is the futures contracts at institutions like CME and CBOE. They place side bets, without holding the physical asset/bitcoin (which would take it out of circulation) so banks and whales can forever keep the price down.  
Whale/bank/gov buys 100,000 Bitcoin on exchanges. Price pumps up.  
Whale/bank/gov  buys futures contracts as price goes up. Contract expires, gains profit.   
Whale/bank/gov then places a short, dumps bitcoin, makes a profit on selling and making money on the way down as well.  
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:19:09
Yeah, it seems like it would make more sense for them to actually hold Bitcoin so that manipulation would be way more difficult. At least it would reflect in the price vs "side betting" where CME doesn't hold any Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:53:28
Nope, thinking the same thing. Particularly with futures contracts. CME and CBOE don't even hold Bitcoin. They sell futures so it is essentially all side bets, which means banks/gov/whales control the price (buy/sell bitcoin while buying and selling futures). Pump and dump to infinity and beyond.   
People may call this FUD and will get down voted into oblivion for stating a very real possibility. I'm still a bull in the long run as more people accumulate, but short to medium term it is definitely grim. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:27:10
Right, but could they keep rinsing and repeating the above to continuously manipulate the price to levels they want?

If you can create an infinite amount of something I don't think it is much more difficult to add a few extra 0s though? In this example, creating $10 is the same as $10B, just typing a some more 0s.
If they are buying Bitcoin with Fiat, then selling it for fiat, but also shorting the hell out of it on CME (since CME doesn't hold Bitcoin), I just don't know how this cycle would be stopped is my point.  
I guess to your point, I should have asked if Bitcoin \*price\* is controlled by the bank.
