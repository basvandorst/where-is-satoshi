Hello Aahgoggalor. Thank you for your comment.
The videos deals a lot with documentation and resources. I've put a lot of effort into exposing the viewers to the documentation and explaining it.
I believe that understanding how to read the documentation and other resources is an important step to full understanding.
Also, in the video description you'll find a list of usefull links.
I hope it will help.

Thank you for your comment.
I've intentionally tried to keep the code as simple as possible. The main idea of this tutorial is not to teach proper coding techniques but to explain how the protocol works.
I've put a lot of effort in explaining it "one line at a time" and I want the viewers to be able to read it like that - step by step.

Thank you both for your comment.
The next video (already in the making) will explain how transactions works and will exlain how to use change addresses.
Im thinking on creating an introduction video which will also deal with how to use the testnet

Thank you for your comment.
I'm familiar with bitcoinlib - this is a great project. My videos tries to put more emphasis on explaining the protocol and I've put a lot of effort in explaining it "one line at a time" and I want the viewers to be able to read it like that - step by step . My code is not meant to be used as a base for a full implementation (it will never will be).
