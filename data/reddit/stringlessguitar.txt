You can mine bitcoins with pretty much everything with a processor in it. Unfortunately you won't see much profit unless you invest in computers designed specifically to mine bitcoin ( the so called, ASICs ). These are expensive, and it's still very hard for the average joe to turn a profit using ASICs.


You can buy any amount of bitcoin you want. A popular misconception is that you need to buy "full" bitcoins. This is not the case, you can make a purchase of 0.001 BTC if you so which. You can then resell it and hope for a profit.
Before you do so, you should understand a few things:
- Bitcoin is very volatile. Some times the price fluctuates over 20% of its value in a matter of hours.
- Bitcoin is a very high risk investment. You may loose all the money you put into it.
- You and only you are responsible for the safety of your crypto currency. Before buying any BTC read a little on how to keep your money safe.
- **NEVER** invest what you are not willing to loose.

I have a question. I have an account in Blockchain.info. There they provided me with a seed. If blockchain.info goes bezerk, I will still be able to recover my account outside their services with my seed right?
Do i still need to panic over this or am I safe?

Depending on where in the world you live you may have to pay taxes on it. Obviously no one will ever care if your profit is 4$, but things get a little bit more complicated if you suddently have some undeclared 4000$ coming into your account.

Usually taxes come after. You will get 120$ when you sell your bitcoin, but you may or may not have to declare them ( I'm not familiar with the american law on bitcoin)
