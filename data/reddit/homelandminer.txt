In this case, Bitcoin is the outdated tank, and every other coin that has built upon the idea and made a better one, is the next version a Tesla car.    Clinging to BTC is no different than clinging to your Model T Ford and saying “ain’t she purdy?!”  Maybe, but I prefer air bags and driver assist.  And when you have, driver-less, I’ll take two.

Curious.   The van or BTC?   The chromoly roll cage or my calculator for Doom Risk?  (Probably all of it. :-(

Slept.

You don't have a sat phone?   That is a key Doomsday tool kit item.

I can jump up and down on the very edges and it will barely flex.  Probably what you don't see is the 3d engineering files that show the tube going down through the body and welded onto the box frame.  It's also made of the lightweight chromoly frames that sand rails are made of that race the Baja 1000.  It's an engineering marvel.  The cool part is that it's bolt on and comes off with a hoist.

I think someone really wants this van by pushing down the coins?!   This is looking like a better deal every day!

For 4.25 BTC total.  I'll throw in 3 tents, 3 surfboards, outdoor kitchen, 2 camping tables, 2 coolers, 2 extra gas cans, roll out carpets, custom canopy and all the extra accessories I can find in my garage.

Good question.  I would say it comes with 20% doom factor (Df), but it really only matters on how you use it.  If you drive it to parking lots and take it safely to nearby safe zones, it's not going to get tested and the DF is only
Multiplied by its Risk status. (RS).  Df x RS = DR. You have to actually take it somewhere without roads, maybe away from LTE, and really put the pressure on its adventurous side.  As your RS is increased the DF becomes more important.  You don't want to stress her past a RS of maybe 350.  That would be 350 x .2 which is a 70 for Doom Risk.  A 100 DR is fatal.   
We have never taken her past a 200 RS.  I have kids.  I don't want to put them at too much risk. Just enough to make it exciting.

Seal Beach, CA is her home.  But she is always Jones-ing for Baja or the mountains.

Charlie Brown?!  Is that you!!?
