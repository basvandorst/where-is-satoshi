Once a case like this goes legal, the only real winners are the lawyers. Take a look at the stats for Madoff, WorldCom, Lehman, Gox you name it. There's never anything left for creditors. I think has been doing a great job of communicating with the user-base in a very difficult situation. I'm sure the management team have every incentive in trying to find a good solution to this hack -- after all, they want Bitfinex to survive. What's the harm in giving them a few days to try to sort this out themselves?

Hardly necessary to make sarcastic comments when people are just asking for help/advice.

Like most Americans, most Chinese don't have overseas investments. So they don't really care about the exchange rate of the RMB vs other currencies. When USD was weak, were American deposit-takers sucking their money out of banks? I don't think so. Biggest risk if RMB weakens significantly is Chinese property investments that were sold to wealthy foreigners by the American banks levered with USD loans. Those investments will collapse and Chinese property might come under a lot of pressure. Is that good for bitcoin? Who knows.

I tried to post an alert on this on a new thread to save people from the scammers but the genius moderators at Reddit clearly decided it was way too helpful and whacked it.

If you don't want to buy physical BTC you can also look at the GABI bitcoin hedge fund, or the bitcoin tracking exchange-traded ETNs such as COINXBT &amp; COINXBE
