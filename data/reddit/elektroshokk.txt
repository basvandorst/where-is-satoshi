Actually retarded. Look at the graph for USDT's being made and you can easily  correlate it with Bitcoin price jumps. This is the dumbest thing ever.

Nice chick next to your bike

May i ask why you did that?

You're over thinking my argument. Btc rn is "decentralized" to the point where an organization could take down the majority of hashing power with nothing but some gun/artillery power. You target the right people at the right time and the cards fall in place.

18% of the top 30% of universities within USA, where most of the volunteers probably knew about crypto.

Wheres the majority of hashpower coming from?

Btc will die if it stays on PoW

That was one of the arguments. You can't refute the other one. Thanks for trying buddy.

If i was  to bomb a couple facilities and a couple million dollars later, i have control of the btc network. 
Also, it's not environmentally friendly to keep mining so damn much. I know its impact on climate change is extremely minimal, but it is not helping. Why would future political candidates push for something that does more harm than good (as of now) to the environment? 
It just needs to move from PoW if we want BTC to realistically be GLOBALLY adopted.

Commercial internet was a thing way later though. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:39:24
what does this even prove? The price? didnt bitcoin drop to 5k?
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:06:02
Those dicks

Oh my it looks like 1000 people own most coins,  does this have any negative effects?  What if some of the sell all their coins?  I'm new so sorry if I'm a bit annoying 
@_date: 2017-04-30 07:56:09
What if someone had access to those addresses and the ability to sell coins,  hypothetically 
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:07:13
What the fuck did you just ask hahaha
@_date: 2016-09-18 17:40:03
aww, youre a cool person.
@_date: 2016-10-03 15:00:13
Why wouldn't the majority of people need to believe in it? 
@_date: 2016-10-03 14:06:30
Honest question,  why wouldn't they?  
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:21:24
And what if that doesn't go to plan,  what's plan B
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:17:38

Not that easy as recognizing a simple pattern lol
