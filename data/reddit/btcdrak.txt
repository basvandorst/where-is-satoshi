Sure, I understood. It doesn't really matter, if there is a state adversary they have all manner of known and unknown vectors (called 0days), not to mention things like national security letters and secret court orders to compel datacenters to assist. HeartBleed was a great example of a literally open door in most webservers on the internet that went unnoticed for a few years! Rather than get caught up in "how", we should be looking at the ultimate countermeasure of using cryptography to verify the integrity of the software.
Bitcoin Core has spent years working on methods to help fight against exactly this sort of threat and has pioneered technology like deterministic building of binaries, a method which is now used in several high profile, high stakes projects like Tor where people's lives literally depend on the ability to detect malicious binaries.
Let's all get into the habit of checking. Let's all encourage others to do it.  Bitcoin Core will eventually release some tools to make the process a little less painful, but it will take some time to get right.

Use a hardware signing device, like Trezor or Ledger Nano S. These can be used with the above wallets.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:50:20
Good to know. Just for the record, I personally cant recommend hardware devices that don't have an on device push button second factor which is why I only mentioned the Nano S and Trezor. I guess Keepkey also falls into that category too.

Having the backup key offline does not qualify this wallet setup to be cold storage.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:51:49
The traded cold storage with limited exposure of their small hotwallet, for 100% of customer funds in hot (multisig) wallet.
Multisignature is effective for implementing signing cosigning policy allowing two or more people to independently verify the validity of the requested payment. It is not a replacement for cold storage/offline signing.
If the cosigner is just blindly signing anything requested just because it comes from an authenticated API from Bitfinex, it's effectively a single signature. BitGo would also not be in a position to verify transaction requests because they dont have access to customer accounts, and are unable to make assessments or followup with customers for additional verification.
Without speaking for BitGo's potential culpability, Bitfinex to my knowledge did not seek any peer review of their proposed new security procedures. They refused to disclose what they were planning and protecting is as a trade secret - security through obscurity. They were too busy congratulating themselves for the "[segregated wallet]( ([archive]( " which would allow customers to view their balances to think about the long term security consequences of what they were proposing and in the end they  transferred customer balances from cold storage into a hot wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-06 07:14:01
They transferred all customer cold storage to hot wallets and declared them unhackable. You tell me.

You can watch the Gitian ritual being performed here:-

Once there are enough signatures all confirming the same binary results from building from the [v0.13.0]( release tag ([a402396dce64c42ea73535b7dde4a9164d430438]( they will be uploaded, a torrent seeded, and the release manager will send a signed message to the [bitcoin-core-dev]( mailing list confirming the release, as well as including the hashes. Note he is simply confirming what can already be inferred from the group of signed gitian results.
At this point, a [blog post]( will be posted to bitcoincore.org, and tweeted from [ The message and hashes will also be widely distributed (the mailing archives are also replicated on several list archives as well as archive.is, and archive.org.
Users should then download the binaries from bitcoin.org or the torrent link announced, in either case you must _verify_ the hashes match at the least and more technical users can use the verify tool [here]( In the future, Bitcoin Core will release a more sophisticated tool to make verification easier for the average user.
I would like to encourage anyone who wants to try their hand at the gitian build process to do so an upload their results. Instructions can be found [here for Gitian setup]( and [here for release process](

The Nano S is [incredible]( In short, everything is done on device no obfuscation tricks necessary like Trezor. The Nano S uses a proper secure element, the ST31. Supports GPG signing and U2F as well, and more apps coming afaik. The only short term downside is we have to wait for Mycelium support but that is coming soon. Trezor has a lot of catching up to do.
@_date: 2016-08-22 15:53:49

Assuming you have the public key of the PPA repository, then I believe apt verifies the .deb packages against that, but you do have to trust the person who packaged the PPA to have included the correct binaries. I think PPAs are bad, but not ideal, certainly not if you are running a bitcoind that handles a lot of value, you should be compiling your own binaries from signed release tags (meaning you would download the public keys of the release manager (at least), git clone and checkout the signed release tag (use git log --show-signatures) and compile from there. You should also verify commits with [this tool](
Pools and exchanges for example compile directly from source because it is safest. It's not much work beyond the initial setup of dependencies (which is just a copy pasta from the build doc).
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:09:24
One other small UX feedback regarding the Ledger Wallet. A couple of people also mentioned this to me. It is annoying sending whole balances from the wallet because of the fee calculation. You cant send whole balance easily. you must first manually type the whole balance to see the fee, then you have to manually subtract the fee and retype the amount to send. This could be solved with a send max button.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:38:48
We dont know for sure, except BitGo have said it wasnt a compromise of their servers. Bitfinex have indicated it was their end too (sorry I dont have time to find the references).
I believe the setup is BitGo and have 1 key, Bitfinex have the other two, one is stored offline. The process is likely to be something along the lines of Bitfinex will sign a transaction, then send it to BitGo's API and they countersign it, then it is broadcast.
We can speculate  that hackers got access to the hot private keys on Bitfinex side (probably from their servers) as well as access to the BitGo API, again probably from Bitfinex's servers.
It appears that BitGo just automatically sign whatever they are asked to by Bitfinex, making it sort of not multisig.
We don't know what actually happened yet, until either BitGo or Bitfinex break the silence. But Bitfinex confirmed they lost just shy of 120,000BTC.

IANAL. I would caution anyone about accepting the BFX token at this time. It may affect your rights to a better settlement if this goes to court (assuming the BFX token is legal in the first place).
I would definitely withdraw your 64% at first opportunity because if this does turn into an IVA/bankruptcy, your funds would be held up for years as well as bleed in "administration fees".
@_date: 2016-08-20 07:52:05
It is clever, and it is certainly no bad, but I dont think positive feedback says a third button wouldnt be better and more intuitive. The Blue is an interesting device but also it is very big in comparison. I still think the Nano S could do with a slightly larger screen... it is actually not so easy to see the Bitcoin address on confirm since the partial address has to scroll back and forth. Nano S is a great proof of concept, but I would encourage a revised form factor for next iteration. I understand right now you have a priority to release more firmware features and so on, but please keep this in mind for future.
So while Nano S is  clear winner over Trezor, at the moment Trezor does have the upper hand because of the physical design.
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:43:38
Disappointing. Bitfinex managed to write a whole lot of nothing Bitfinex haven't already said while congratulating yourselves (much like they were self congratulating at how they had gotten rid of cold storage for "100% secure unhackable wallets^tm ").
These are not users' losses, these are Bitfinex's losses passed onto users (with the promise to make whole if possible).
Users want Bitfinex to disclose how much they contributed to arrive at the 36% ~~haircut~~beheading. They need numbers, not self platitudes.

You can export the xpubkey which will allow you to generate payment addresses as a watch-only wallet. You can import these into most wallets like electrum, mycelium etc.
iirc, you can connect the device, start the chrome wallet, select account and then account settings - &gt; export. It will display the xpub and you can scan, copy paste, save, email.

The original judgement is here: 
**EDIT: it is actually not "fined" it's a civil case, okcoin has to pay the victim for 40% of their loss.**
It's important to note that all Chinese exchanges have been operating in a grey area since day 1. This judgement refers to okcoin.cn, not the .com site which is a separate business afaik.
**EDIT 2: The case is from 2014, this is the OKCoin appeal, which they lost.**
**EDIT 3: Apparently the original judgement was for 80% and was reduced to 40% on appeal.**

Maybe you arent familiar with the device in practice. To restore a seed the trezor asks for word x and you have to type into the computer. A keyloggers l could get the 24 words but bot the order. This reduces the entropy to 71 bits.

I'm constantly in amazement that people seem to have forgotten the basic fundamentals of bitcoin. It's egalitarian. the protocol doesn't care who you are, the consensus rules are the consensus rules. To be clear, if the majority, and by majority I'm talking 95%+ of the hash power is not going to adopt BIP101 and the majority of exchanges, that account for 90%+ of the global trade volume are not going to switch, then pray tell, how are you going to convince the protocol to change?
I suggest you look at the combined exchange volumes of and do some rough back of the envelop maths.
Okcoin .cn (CNY)
OKcoin .com
Huobi (CNY)

Let's paste it here: source: 
And I quote: " As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldn't be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation. 0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens. At most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting them as balance or spending them is premature." -Satoshi
Now waiting for at least 1 confirmation and not liking zeroconf transactions sounds an awful lot like something that would contradict the "instant" quality of his peer 2 peer cash system. The white paper was the beginning but things were implemented and realities sink in, after a lot of work and collaboration between him and many others it was possible for Bitcoin to advance. The whitepaper isn't the bible, not even Satoshi held it in such a religious regard as people hold it here.

What should be clear by now is that we support scaling Bitcoin with it's unique properties intact and that we are not interested in doing things that will change the core properties of Bitcoin because if that happens, it become wholly uninteresting (just another payment system, yawn).
Bitcoin is not being developed specifically for Silicone Valley or for investors, I think that's a really key thing. The focus is on making Bitcoin robust, secure and scalable while retaining it's unique properties as a first priority. While on-ramps and off-ramps are important for accelerated adoption, we should not sell out in desperation. If Bitcoin cannot stand on it's own two feet and can be easily changed at the whim of Governments or venture capital interests, what is to stop Bitcoin becoming the next fiat currency replete with "quantitative easing".

"BIP202" seems controversial because it has no upper limit. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 10:30:52
Bobby owns both a major exchange and a major mining pool, it would hardly be a problem. None of the Chinese exchange or mining pools are going to accept a hostile bid, neither is Bitfinex. So even by so called "economic majority theory" collectively they represent a majority of the egress points for bitcoin. So both economic and technically BIP101 is snookered. Whatever the solution turns out to be, we know it wont be BIP101, or XT.
Further, Coinbase et al are not going to risk their business on a political coup, they are simply playing poker and trying to exert pressure. Yes it is a "coup", because this talk of economic majority usurping the will of full nodes and mining pools fits the very definition of a coup, which is, to force change means other than the established rules and process which for Bitcoin means an uncontroversial hard fork where almost all nodes and miners agree.

Sure, but SegWit is a part of the plan. There's BIPs 68 and 112 as well, which enable lightning. Those proposals are very nearly ready and can be deployed in 0.12.1. If so, it means Lightning and similar payment channel applications can be used on mainnet all of which will reduce on-chain transaction volume. There's also a subsequent hardfork as well as big improvements to relay. Weak blocks will be a thing too. All of this can happen in 2016 if we are not constantly distracted by the onslaught of social media attacks :-P

@_date: 2015-12-19 22:05:50
As it stands I cannot accept "BIP202" and I think it will have a hard time gaining technical consensus.
I think straight 2MB bump proposed by BIP102 is much less controversial.
FWIW I also think 2/4/8 has some mileage in it subject to adjusting the numbers for SegWit (8MB is too much).

Since it's an opcode you can use complex rules like before a certain date, 2of3 can sign (the parents + child for example), after a certain date only the child needs to sign. See the BIP for several other usecases.

@_date: 2015-06-22 23:41:57
That's a pretty fair set of standards but I think you have to account for non-consensus as consensus. Putting aside the blocksize debate, what if I come along and say Bitcoin needs this widget, I write a BIP and some code, submit a PR. I fail to get consensus. That means either there is a resounding no, or, there is wide disagreement about what the widget should do. That is a consensus in and of itself. It might be frustrating but you cant say the process has failed. 
The big problem with this debate is Gavin painted a frame and everyone's perception is now enclosed in that frame. He said the sky is falling, bitcoin will fail if we dont increase blocksize now. He presented evidence for his view. Much of that has been refuted, but it doesnt matter, because for the non-technical community the damage is done, all they can see is the sky falling, they fear it so that's enough. So everyone is boxed into the idea that the only way forward is block increase right now anything else is a failure.

Yes, but read what I said, Bobby is not the only exchange protesting. If you're talking about economic majorities, Coinbase + Bitstamp + ItBit are not it. And I'm not entirely sure how these exchanges think they could force miners onto a hostile chain when no-one is mining the other chain... have you looked recently? that's not going to change. 0.1% to 0.2% of the last 1000 blocks at any given time are for BIP101. It's time to realise political bid failed and move on.

It's even worse when you consider API services are encouraging companies to use them rather than run their own full nodes. It works, because it's easier. This also contributes to the number of falling nodes as people choose 3rd party validation over self validation.

@_date: 2015-12-05 18:50:10
Yeah so basically they will pay you in advance for your mining shares from funds they have already have (so they don't have to wait for a block to be found before paying out or waiting for the 100 block maturity before the coinbase is spendable). It is essentially a 21 sponsored convenience, not a technical innovation. Any pool could offer this service if they chose to.
@_date: 2015-06-04 06:35:22
It's simply developers agreeing not to act emotionally. There isnt a problem now, or in the near future; increasing blocksize ad infinitum isnt going to solve scalability anyway so let's look at as many options for dealing with scalability before looking at increasing blocksize. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:04:14
Haha. Unexpected! Thanks for taking the time to reply. Maybe I am being harsh, the point is that we need to focus on enabling scaling technologies so that layer 2 payments are possible. Until those technological capabilities are built in (specifically RCLTV and malleability fixes) then it is difficult to do things that make a big big difference. I think it's worth mentioning those in your article because the ramifications for bitcoin will be huge if they are added. The parallel soft fork mechanism will also mean we're not held up for 6 months each time we want a new feature. BIP66 is currently holding up the queue for example.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:09:49
I spoke with him and as I understood it, he said that silly bursts of spamming attacks do not simulate what actually happens in real life and only confirm what is already well known for years regarding what happens when you spam the network.
The bitcoin ecosystem is elastic and reactive. We've seen worrying traffic trends in the past (e.g. SatoshiDice) where the ecosystem adapted and the source of the problem went away. More worrying than filled mempools is the problem presented by bloating the UTXO set. As I understand it he intends to bloat the UTXO set until it bursts and maintain this for months. Increasing the blocksize by a huge amount will only make this UTXO bloat problem worse.
I suggest following his bitcointalk thread as I may have missed some details.

When the miners are happy, it shows. Check out BIP65 adoption. It's been 3 weeks and all but 1 pool has upgraded already...


They arent, it's all the full nodes that have to agree + all the miners. Again, let's look at since XT was released, they got 8% nodes agreeing. In just 3 weeks since 0.11.2 released (which has BIP65), 25% of the node upgraded so far (and rising rapidly)... It's been 3 months since XT and they are languishing in single digits...
My point is, the network has already voted against BIP101 and XT with it's feet. BIP101 has been rejected, outright. Whatever solution moving forward, it will not be BIP101, that much is crystal clear.

It really is. China is a walled country in so many ways it's not funny and that includes exposure to international media through television. Internet connectivity inside China is quite a different story to connectivity to the outside world. Remember they their reach is so far they perform traffic analysis on everything exiting and entering China to be able to block VPNs and such like.  All connectivity is licensed by the Chinese government, there is no way for a private company to just run private cables. Breaking the law carries *very* stiff penalties all the way up to the death penalty for many things you or I would consider misdemeanour's.
A little background, you're dealing with a country that will *stop at nothing* to get it's way and save face. I have plenty eye witness accounts of atrocities committed by the Chinese which make many despot nations seem tame, stuff you never get to hear about because it happens deep inside China where the western press are not allowed because foreigners need special visas even inside certain parts of China.

[BIP68]( [BIP112]( and [BIP113]( are all required. BIP113 has been merged, and BIP68 &amp; BIP112 are pending peer review. Once they are merged, they need to be deployed as a soft-fork using ISM or Versionbits deployment mechanism.
These BIPs are all non-controversial, but the delay is in getting the implementation details right. BIP68 has undergone a number of revisions as the peer review process unearthed things that needed refinement. I am cautiously optimistic they will be deployed by March (but that is my own personal assessment).
[BIP65]( is already active, which is also required.

Think of sidechains and separate blockchains where you can transfer tokens between bitcoin and the sidechain. It's like an altcoins that doesnt mint it's own coins, but instead coins can be transfered from bitcoin onto the sidechain.
Think of colored coins as a meta layer: messages are encoded in normal bitcoin transactions to allow the description of meta tokens, and their ownership/transfer.

As I understand it, sidechains cant "steal value" because they rely on pegging with bitcoin. You can "transfer" bitcoins into the sidechain (making them unspendable in bitcoin) but the sidechain doesnt mint it's own coins independently. This is different to an altcoin which has it's own coins. Sidechains would share in bitcoin's value, not compete with it.
You could argue that they could take some transaction volume away from bitcoin and thus fees, but I think this is tenuous.

Centralisation would imply that both mining and full node validation become centralised and as such allow a government or major players to control the outcome of consensus.
Lightning doesn't do that, but one does form network hubs where users can participate in the system where they exchange signed bitcoin transactions... such hubs could also decentralised networks, somewhat like DHTs for example. There's no way for someone to control the outcome of Lightning payment channels.
@_date: 2015-12-07 09:25:12
OK so to be clear, I hope it is implemented soon but it does not mean it will be necessarily. But also remember, SW isnt actually brand new, it's been in use in Elements Alpha for 6 months.
I think I wanted to be clear about the process, that consensus changes don't "just get merged" into Core, unless it goes through a rigorous process of review which requires publishing a BIP and having a concrete implementation PR.
I am extremely enthusiastic about SW because it gives so many benefits to Bitcoin including stopping malleability in its tracks once and for all in a far more robust way than the BIP62 whack-a-mole approach.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:33:21
Preach it brother. It's interesting as the dust settles more and more people are seeing the weird politics that Gavin/Mike have been playing and more people seeing there are valid concerns from practically every other technical peer.
To be disregarding so many technically competent people is foolhardy and arrogant.
The hard forking coup is surely to fail spectacularly though: no-one is going to seriously risk their business by trying to force consensus. The only people claiming victory are people with nothing to lose. Go long on popcorn because this might be the best way for the bad apples to fork themselves out of relevance. 
I might point out that Gavin did force the issue once before with P2SH (BIP16). He rushed it with sky is falling urgency. No-one used it for 2 years, then when it was finally used in the wild we found serious issues and limitations with it (all too late). BIP17, the counter proposal was not just better but light years better.

Exactly what I said, support for larger blocks does not mean they will participate in a coup. If Bitcoin Core comes up with a scaling plan, they will support it up to 8MB, that's what it means.

Maybe you mean nLocktime. When this was set it couldnt be mined until the locktime expired, but it meant you couldnt prove the funds were committed. With CLTV you can lock those outputs on the blockchain.
You can make very interesting scripts like "if locktime I can spend, else 2 of 3 multisig can spend"
CLTV can do both timestamps or block height.
You can do both.
@_date: 2015-12-21 02:29:10
I think you vastly underestimate how easy it is to double-spend with almost laser precision. Your assumptions about relay are wrong, because one can control who sees what first so a double spend wouldn't even be detected until the confirmation comes through. [0-confirmations are at best a notification mechanism to be taken with a pinch of salt]( Just because you see a transaction makes no guarantee what others have seen.

What, you mean the small detail that it is trivial to steal because of people's reliance on them? Or the small pesky detail that large industry players have been ripped of to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars?
0-confirms simply an artefact of the gossip network used to propagate transactions ultimately to miners. I agree they are useful, at least for the sender, to know his tx has been seen on the network and thus likely to confirm (assuming they paid enough fee). It is less useful for the merchant who simply knows a payment is on the way and *might* confirm.
It is irresponsible to frame 0-conf as being in any way safe.

LOL, you're giving Peter Todd way too much credit.
According to how Bitcoin has traded in the last 9 months, the selloff was absolutely predictable. We have never broken through the R2 monthly pivots and every time we have gotten near we've rejected it. This means professional traders are absolutely going to take profits when reaching R2 pivots (because it's safe) and that must cause a pullback at the least before trying for again. Breaking established resistance levels like that almost always requires a couple of stabs.
There is still hope for a breakout because for the last 9 months the 3d 50MA has been a clear resistance and for the first time we've traded above it. That's another reason for market uncertainly because you dont break months of resistance without retests for confirmation, thus pullbacks are absolutely necessary to establish if support has been forming as the price rose. This determines if it's safer to push up further because we find and prove support levels are also rising.
The point is, while no-one can predict price, behaviour under certain conditions is very predictable. That's how professional traders consistently make money and 94% of retail traders lose money (real forex stats), by following smaller predictable moves with a tight risk management strategy.

This particular script you can make your coins unspendable for a time if desirable. In more complex applications you might want to create scripts which read something like "if locktime unmet, multisif 2-3 can spend, else i can spend with my private key". This allows automatically expiring escrow. There are many complex scripts that can be created (and will soon be available on coinb.in). Check out some examples in the [BIP65]( text.

This isnt anything to do with Blockstream. It's quite clear that Greg Maxwell (and the other developers employed by blockstream have in fact held the same opinions on bitcoin scalability/blocksize for years pre-dating blockstream. Greg has explained his technical perspective very well and I am humble enough to recognise when someone knows more than me and I am willing to learn. I find the intricacies absolutely fascinating.
Particularly for blocksize there is just no commercial conflict of interest, bigger blocks would help sidechains and lightning network (which they now sponsored).
Not everything has to be a conspiracy. Greg has absolutely proved his technical competence, expertise and vision. You may not realise many of the inventions in this space started out as conversation with or ideas that started from Greg. To dismiss him just because he doesn't agree is ridiculous. To invalidate his opinion on blocksize because of Blockstream is illogical. (same goes for the other devs).
I find it difficult that these discussion are treated like American politics where the substance of a debate is always overshadowed by stupid logical fallacies. It's very telling that the pro20 fanatics spend their time slinging mud, and Greg spends his time writing voluminous essays of explanation which are often drowned out by noise.
It's even more incredible that until this blockwar started, Blockstream was the best thing since sliced bread for most people here and everyone has been cheer-leading sidechains as the saviour of all evils. Now somehow they are the enemy and the developers are evil and incompetent. If you ever read my concerns and opinions you would know I never held this view. 
Sure, I have spoken out about potential difficulties with any one organisation employing lots of developers, but I must again draw your attention to the fact that there can be no credible argument that Blockstream developers are cockblocking something on commercial/competitive interests - I repeat it again, the developers have a history pre-dating Blockstream holding the same views. If you are not nuanced enough to see that, there is no way you can appreciate the nuances of the blocksize debates and I can only conclude you are trolling.
We don't have to agree on what is best for bitcoin, but when we debate, it should ideally be on technical and academic merits alone.

@_date: 2015-06-22 23:18:21
I would be careful with Chinese translations "must be increased" may not be the right translation there. 
Regarding the devs, I think it's better to put away the tin foil because if you research you'll find those claims are just political shenanigans. There *is* a lot of disagreement about how and when to increase blocksize (but not that it will have to be increased at some point). The thing is, the majority of the technical community do oppose large blocksize increase and many also dispute it needs to be tackled right now. The number of people in the technical community who agree with Gavin's proposal are much less than those who disagree. 
I think you also mistake intention here, there is no drive to push things to LN, it's a recognition that bitcoin cannot compete with VISA on chain regardless of the blocksize and that something needs to be invented to handle it because fundamentally bitcoin as is cannot do it. Please remember that those technologies were invented and conceived outside of this debate, not as a consequence of them. That infographic that appeared the other day is a complete handwave that just plays with numbers and looks pretty without tackling the how those numbers can be made to work. This is where a lot of the disagreements come from in the wider community.
The same developers who were heros a few months ago are being decried now for being harbingers of downfall.
I think the best examples I can give for how the non-technical community deals with things compared to the technical community with an example:
Address reuse - widely decried by the technical community, r/bitcoin raised pitchforks when suggestions were made that addresses should only be used once. Non-technical community complains at how the devs are making bitcoin less useful and will cause the downfall of bitcoin. Technical community develops HD wallets. Problem solved.

Remember BFL's failure to deliver in 2013? It was pretty sad that all the people who paid with BTC get screwed yet many who paid with Paypal and VISA got their money back. But this is more reason why Bitcoin probably isnt a mass consumer tool. If you want protections like that a company like Paypal which offers Buy dispute resolution is the only way (which they could still do while accepting Bitcoin as a payment method).

Viacoin does not have RBF at the moment. The problem for Viacoin is confirmations typically happen between 10-30 seconds making even fee bumping FSS-RBF unlikely to succeed.


This isnt a consensus rule, just a relay and mempool policy. Unlike Gavin's proposal that requires everyone to agree, this can work with just one miner and a few relay nodes. 
It's actually in the miners best interest to mine the higher fee and nothing stops them from doings so anyway. RBF is a logical development. This version of RBF is more contentious but first-seen 0-conf safe version is not contentious and actually a much requested feature by wallet developers.

It's not just gh/joule from the chips, it's the availability of cheaper electricity for the larger miners that make their operations much more efficient than consumer devices can be and only further widens the gap. And yes, I think it will get a lot more efficient than it is currently, no idea for how long but enough times to be problematic for 21's hardware. I think it would be a lot better for 21 to just ship devices with some mBTC as part of the cost of the device to enable it to perform it's functions. If they go down the payment channels route the amount of BTC required (for fees) will reduce exponentially.

Big money is already asking both Peter and Gavin's opinions about bitcoin and the technology. I know Peter has consulted for some of the biggest names in the banking industry already. We know Gavin also does consulting work for big interest groups.
That aside, I think you underestimate the ability for interest groups to co-opt the bitcoin protocol which must be done through both hashing power and wide deployment of code. That's not something NYSE or BoA can control. Put your tin foil on for a moment however and realise one way they could influence bitcoin is to weaken the protocol so it tends towards more centralisation (thus taking away the validation of widely distributed fullnodes and replacing it with centralised processing which is claimed is a potential consequence of bigger blocks).

This comes up over and over again. A change like this requires basically near 100% consensus of everyone or Bad Things Will Happen (tm). You cant fork bitcoin consensus by coup - and if you think big businesses would be willing to attempt a hostile take over, I think you're smoking something you shouldnt. While many businesses and miners may say they support 20MB blocks, dont take that as meaning they would be willing to try and force it on the network. They will follow status quo from Bitcoin Core.

3. There are thousands of sites using Kayako support.

It needs an official introduction from BTC-e to say "this is us" before we can say it's belongs to BTC-e.

Not true. Signed bitcoin transactions that are incapable of being double spent are fungible. That's the whole point of micropayment channels. They are not IOUs because they cannot be defaulted on. LN and micropayment channel payments are real smart contracts. They take bitcoin to the next level because you do away with confirmation time entirely, payments are actually instant with no risk of double spending.

Your comment seems a rather disingenous. You know fine they are only stating their own opinions. Bobby happens to own a big pool and major exchange, and has made it clear he will not support a contentious hard fork. It's entirely his business to do so and he's quite intelligent enough to understand how to handle his own business interests. Your deliberate attempt to frame this as anything other tells me you are not contributing positively to this debate but are trying to deliberately sow discord and disinformation into the narrative. As such, you are performing a worse form of censorship than could ever be accused of.

This is a key misunderstanding. The Bitcoin Core project does not force anyone to upgrade, or run their software. Any changes proposed by Bitcoin Core are proposals made by releasing software. If participants agree, they can upgrade. If another project wants to propose something different as X T did, then they too can release their proposal to the community.
Bitcoin Core prefers not to release controversial proposals since the chance of it becoming a network consensus rule are slim and it's also hazardous. If another project wishes to do so, they are free to do so. Bitcoin is permissionless.

The platform is closed so when you loan out BTC or USD for others to margin trade with, the platform protects lenders by force liquidating positions that run out of margin. The loans cannot be removed from the platform by borrowers.
I've used it for years, it's always been good to me. I know plenty other traders that make use of the lending platform.  You might want to ask on where there are a lot of people who use this platform.

But likewise, Satoshi is hardly recognised as a good programmer either. In fact, many developers say his code was a complete mess and have spent years cleaning it up to the point there's almost nothing left from Satoshi. Satoshi's code was more like a working prototype. "Being a good programmer" is important when making working prototypes.

What he has done is not in the spirit of what is meant by informal consensus: He's taken the political route. What happened is he failed to get consensus for years so now he's trying to apply pressure this way. And remember, according to Gavin there was always consensus among the people he talks to, which he likes to refer to as the economic majority, so without any questions, he should have written a BIP in the beginning.

The most compelling (from memory) part of the story is Satoshi did not cite any of Szazbo's work who was one of the most prolific in the space of digital money. At the time there were so few people researching this stuff there is no way Satoshi could have not been aware of Szabo's work especially about Bitgold which is incredibly similar: this is against all academic norms so much so it is clearly a conscious decision. The really interesting part is right after Bitcoin whitepaper was released, Szabo changed the dates on his blog for his posts about Bitgold from 2005 to after Bitcoin's release. you can actually see it here  notice the URL link is 2005 yet the blog post is 2008?

Greg you are completely wrong here. The changes made make it impossible for **Bitcoin Core** to mechanically rebase CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY because EvalScript() API has been changed depriving it of txTo and nIn. I was rebasing Peter's patch against Bitcoin Core master branch ;)
FWIW, Viacoin has no problems keeping up with Bitcoin Core changes and merges daily - it is literally bang up to date, but thanks to my attention, we now know that the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY patch everyone is so looking forward to in Bitcoin 0.11 cannot be merged because of overzealous refactoring. Exactly why are we changing API signatures?
I find it ridiculous someone as qualified as yourself would try to distract the discussion with "altcoin" word when other bitcoin developers agree that ["Some change is in order, gentlemen - Jeff Garzik"](
I suppose by equal measures you also have a problem with the fact I sponsored the work on BIP65 and CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY patch? In this case, Viacoin is helping the entire ecosystem, not trying to compete with Bitcoin.

Absolute rubbish - sidechains is just a fancy name for an altcoin, i.e. blockchain with it's own tokens and state. The sidechains concept means blockchains can be aware of the state of other chains. The whole concept of sidechains actually *validates* altcoins because it is one. It's just clever marketing to sound like it's something different.
There are cool things you can do when making chains understand each other, but that isnt specifically "sidechains", they are concepts that come about from "linking" chains (read altcoins) together.

They are blockchains (thus altcoins) that are can communicate and be aware of the state of other chains. That is all they are. Blockchains that can interact with the state of another can allow things like 2 way pegging, in theory at least, but those features are not sidechains.
@_date: 2014-08-01 10:21:27
**Get your facts right:** Viacoin's [initial distribution]( method, to make it more fair was by presale. Otherwise experienced and power miners get all the advantage. It was never an pitched as an investment, IPO, sale of shares, voting rights, VC, crowdfunding, it was a simple presale as a way to fairly distribute coins. Even Ethereum's epic presale is not pitched as an investment and they clearly state that it's possible no end product may ever ship. Of course it's very likely they will materialise something.
However, given the bid price everyone paid was 6,102 satoshi per via, and the price on exchanges never went below 10k, and is currently ~40k *I think people who speculated did very well out of it so far by several hundred percent*. But this was never about price. This is about a project I believe in and it would seem, many others believe in too.
Further more, I **have** been spending the money on the project. I have hired two people so far, Peter and another full time developer, Grynn (see the blog). Those are not insignificant expenses and I imagine there will be a lot more on the way.
Side-chains is another technology that should be funded, but I believe it is already being funded. I don't support sidechains because it doesnt attempt to solve the scalability issues. Neither does merged mining solve mining centralisation.

A protocol to allow interoperability between other blockchains, which they are calling "sidechains". One of the features of blockchain interoperability is the ability to be able to "transfer" tokens between chains. What that means in reality is making a token unspendable in one chain and then creating a token on the other chain at a pegged ratio.
Despite their marketing, this is altcoin technology for altcoins.
But to answer your question, the main aspect is the interoperability. The rest are things you can do once you have interoperability that, in the same way, once you have a distributed timestamped proof of publication, aka "the blockchain", you can do lots of other things other than "money". Same with sidechains, once you have blockchain interoperability, it opens up other applications, like for example token transfer.

It's okay, you can say what you like. Mostly people at r/bitcoin dont get it anyway, I was almost not going to post. 1000 people have already read it on Twitter and it's being discussed in all the IRC back channels. A majority of respondents agree, it doesnt look good at Stamp.
People were posting with the same veracity as you about MtGox "FUD" until it finally happened.  You conveniently avoid the important details in your critique like the way in which the "audit" was done. Some of the points about the audit were already brought up by others. 
I love how you claim to be on reddit a lot, yet your brain conveniently filters news you dont like. Go look, withdrawal delays have been a recent topic occurring just as it did at MtGox
This is a PSA and opinion piece. If you don't like it I'm okay with that, but FUDster I am not.
Lastly I have been very clear about this. It looks bad and Bitstamp have the power to address these discrepancies. I never say with 100% certainty something is wrong, because I have no concrete evidence (that I could give to police). 
They can end the questions but so far, they have been evasive and slapdash about it. You dont know how corrupt the Bitcoin community is at higher levels. You can remain in your bubble, but there is serious corruption going on still, and Stamp stinks. If they come clean or prove their worth, great. I will be very happy. But unlike you, I am not willing to pretend everything is rosy just because it makes bitcoin look bad.

up of code into logical source code files.




several situations where we had active users, but zero hardware access for
debugging, and zero access to the vendor knowledge (hardware documentation,
engineers).  Failure was not an option.  ;p


invasive data structures are easier to review, logically segregated, and
not obscured by further code movement changes down the line.  In code such
as Bitcoin Core, it is important to think about the _patch stream_ and how
to optimize for reviewer bandwidth.

High frequency trading bots also inflate volume by making lots and lots of small scalping trades. 
Futures trading has also become incredibly popular and this also has caused volume to rise immensely. Spend some time trading on these exchanges and you will see quite clearly what is and isn't going on. r/bitcoin loves to play down the effect of the Chinese market, but the truth is very much, they are the market makers, whether you like it or not.

There is no way to control what exchanges do I am afraid. Once you release the wallet daemon mining pools and exchanges cannot be stopped from getting involved. But thanks for your encouragement and level headed comments. 
Presentation of the presale was completely transparent and clear. There was a video explaining things, blog posts, terms and other pages. It is not credible anyone could misunderstand. Rather than get initial coins through mining, or buying them on an exchange after the fact, it would be by presale bids for a fixed quantity. There is nothing dishonest or misleading about it and it has worked out very well for everyone.
People do buy cryptographic tokens as a speculative vehicles and doesnt really matter if they pay for them by mining expenses, buy them from an exchange or bid for them in a presale, but the intention of mining is not to present an investment opportunity, it's a method of coin distribution. A presale is the same (just that costs convert to tokens). I cant help it if people buy things to speculate with. I'm collecting Bitcoin Magazines, unopened because I speculate they will be worth money in the future - the decision is mine, and I was never sold an investment by Bitcoin Magazine.
I am sorry if this doesn't fit with a traditional way of doing things, but this is the path I chose, on purpose. I prefer to under promise and over deliver. I never promised to hire devs, but I have done so. I never promised to fund Tree Chains, but I am doing so. I will roll out ClearingHouse in time too, probably a lot sooner than anyone expects too.
In direct answer to you question though: if people had a mismatch between their expectations and now they could have and would have sold their coins. Anyone who bought in the presale is in profit by several hundred percent. According to the exchanges history, no-one has sold below their buying price so I fail to see that any wrongdoing. I have delivered in all senses of the word and I will continue to do my best and contribute something worthwhile to the community.

I cant believe you are still going on about this: CLTV was being rebased *for bitcoin master* as preparation to get a PR ready for bitcoin core. Since viacoin is bang up to date with bitcoin master the rebase works for *both* projects simultaneously. I came across a stumbling block because of the changed EvalScript() API and not knowing how best to solve that. I figured I would bring it up on the list later but then this who thing started raging.
So once and for all, please - viacoin code has not diverged significantly from bitcoin, this issue was never about viacoin even though I have every intention of merging CLTV into viacoin which will probably happen before bitcoin because it bitcoin has pushed release of this feature to 0.11, which is fine. At the very least it will provide some real world testing which would be a good thing for the due diligence of bitcoin.
With sipa's example to do the validation in SignatureChecker, I have since finished the [branch]( and handed it back to peter so he can finalise it and submit it as a PR to bitcoin core as originally intended.
I want to make it very clear I am capable enough of making clear distinctions between my own interests and what is best for bitcoin and I have argued against my own interests in bitcoin PRs. My intention is to help in whatever little were I can and not muddle interests.

Hate to be a party pooper, but there is nothing to "invest" in. Viacoins are digital tokens traded on the open market and if you choose to speculate in that market, it's really got nothing to do with the Viacoin project, in the same way as people's speculative trading in Bitcoin has nothing to do with the bitcoin project.
I started the Viacoin project and I am personally investing in technology I believe can contribute to the greater good. Peter has demonstrated extremely good faith to the crypto community and clearly has the skills necessary to be inventive and to materialise those inventions. I very much like how he is willing to critique his own works and inventions pointing out potential shortcomings.
If the discussions OP highlight are not prime examples of the politics clouding bitcoin development, I really dont know what is. Those politics are getting in the way of what is important. I realise that in some ways Bitcoin maybe too big to make radical changes too, and that is why you are seeing other projects crop up to explore areas Bitcoin wont (because of politics) or cant, because of ossification. 
The stakes are extremely high. Decentralised consensus systems could play an increasingly important role in the world but currently mining centralisation is a severe weakness which will see the very thing we love come under central control. It's happening right before our eyes. Whether anything comes our of venture or not, I really don't know, but I cannot stand around idle when I can be contributing towards technological progress that can impact society for the better.

@_date: 2014-10-23 13:39:36
It's not about the developer, but the mining pools specifically. The system already encourages pool mining and variance causes people to flock to the most efficient pools. The bitcoin devs can release whatever they like, but if the mining pools refuse to upgrade or make their own patches that is what the network will follow. Users are going to use what works, they are not going to involve in politics.
The proposals being made mean pools will form cartels to decide what to merge mine or not, this creates central point of failure and also puts pool operators in the position of making or breaking a coin. It's just like Hollywood or music producers who decide who reaches the masses or not.

A common misunderstanding on this thread is what the costs refer to. Bitcoin is more expensive to process per transaction than centralised systems. It is not the cost to the end user. If you take the costs of running the network, all the mining hardware, investment, electricity etc and the mining reward subsidies, per transaction bitcoin txs cost a lot more to process than a centralised system. Keeping maths simple just divide the number of daily transactions mined by the number of bitcoins rewarded to pay the miners.
Sure centralised systems like paypal and visa are price gouging their customers, but they are still a hellavalot cheaper to process per transaction as a whole. Bitcoin only helps to drive down their fees to the end user through competition but does not compete at all in terms of cost or efficiency.

@_date: 2014-10-27 12:53:39
I dont know what new economics you are referring to. Without the mining subsidy there would not be a bitcoin network to process transactions. Therefore the cost of running the network is the subsidy. Cheaper than visa for the end users is only possible because of the subsidy per transaction. As a payment network it is terribly inefficient to run compared to centralized systems. No one is saying bitcoin doesnt have a lot to offer, or that it is not challenging payment systems and even even could drive down end user costs for things like wester union etc, but to say bitcoin is more efficient is stretching the benefits beyond hard cold facts.

Right, but the technical approach to a hard fork is to talk and gain consensus with the technical community, then once there is some semblance of consensus and united voice, or even some concrete technically sound options, engage the public and see if they agree.
If you do it the other way round, public first, then engage with the technical community, it's political because now the tech community is under pressure to satisfy the public who most probably will not have the best information to hand.
The dev list is entirely open, and of course many technical people lurk there, so there is no way people who want to know about stuff would ever get left out of the loop... but the problem is Gavin has been doing a lot of this discussion *in private*.

I was rebasing PTs branch to bitcoin master so a PR could be made for Bitcoin since there is quite a large consensus for BIP65.

OP highlight the key point. Bitcoin Core development operates on **developer consensus**, not public opinion.
and have unfortunately taken the route of public opinion than the route of developer discussion and consensus.
I find this particularly strange because as developers they know discussion should be made on the bitcoin mailing list and actual code discussed in a Github Pull Request.
Bitcoin might be revolutionary, and might appear to be anti-fragile, but it's only as robust as the decisions made by the developers who actually contribute code. Bitcoin is of sufficient size that we should always err on the side of caution, mistakes could be catastrophic.
But the court of public opinion is far too quick to jump on trendy arguments without taking time to really absorb the enormity the changes being proposed. Gavin and Mike are trying to dazzle and scare public opinion into compliance because they know fine that there has been developer opposition to increasing block size for many *years*.

Instant confirmations, trustless. Takes a lot of transaction volume off the main bitcoin blockchain. *May* improve privacy.
Lightning are complex multiparty, bi-directional payment channels. It makes use of smart contracts such parties can exchange signed transactions offline knowing their transactions will settle on chain. 
They have a website  and also a mailing list at 
Lightning networks will need a few changes to Bitcoin, namely "relative" CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, and some transaction malleability fixes. However normal payment channels can be used today and give a sneak preview in to what Lightning will be able to to later. Stremium for example is a brand new micropayment channel system using bitcoin.
Disadvantages, personally I don't see any downsides. You are taking transactions off the blockchain so some of the "can see everything on the blockchain" will go away. Payment hubs could go offline, parties could go offline: but maybe there are technical measures that could be implemented to make the experience smooth and robust

I think it was fixed longer than 5 months ago, but you could always create a new one to be safe.
There are plans for Bitcoin Core to migrate to deterministic signatures but apparently it depends on either decoupling from OpenSSL or waiting for an as yet unreleased version of OpenSSL if I understood it correctly.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:11:51
You are way off base here because they are not following the "modern software development practices" you speak of. Refactoring a basic discipline that has a clear set of steps. Firstly code should be rearranged as is, without touching any code. That helps reduce file sizes and make things more logical. It's literally a bunch of copy paste. Once you are happy with how things have become, you can move on to the next stages. Preferably you'd have a stable release after this.
The second part is to actually refactor. That means, without changing the behaviour of, optimise the code. No new features, no fixing of bug. Refactoring simply optimises whatever behaviours you have already. Because you do not fix bugs or add features, you dont need to mess with unit tests which will help assure (but cannot guarantee) you haven't changed behaviour.
At no point should APIs be changed or backwards compatibility broken. Refactoring, bug fixing and features are quite separate and should never be combined.
It's nothing to do with bashing people doing hard work. This is not therapy, it's people contributing to a $5bn project where there actions have consequences. it's even more important to follow best practices as you misquoted. In fact, I might add it's not even people contributing for free (so you have to cut them some slack) since almost everyone is now salaried by the Bitcoin Foundation or Blockstream. 
I might add that a project as large as Bitcoin Core (in terms of code size and complexity) requires a lot of peer review. The sheer volume of PRs of late has made it impossible to follow, especially when it's full of unnecessary PRs. If we'd just spent some time reorganising code into smaller files, we'd have a really clear idea of how to proceed with virtually no risk. It's super easy to peer review such code changes too.
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:42:25
I think you misunderstand the workflow. **ALL** changes to bitcoin core are by pull request and can only get merged by consensus of major contributors. Having write access does not mean a change can be made without consensus. 
This is how github popularized git version control and made coding social. You will notice that actually 95% of merged are made by Wladamir (the current project lead), but only after lots of discussion, testing and clear consensus.

While it's always good to look at people's motivations, if you look back at posts from those "objecting" devs you will find their opinions have not changed in years.

Matt this is exactly the point: If Mike (and Gavin) make an unsound proposal but they want it, they wont stop until they get what they want. This includes outright misleading people who dont have the technical background to know any better and will just go with what "sounds reasonable". Then they'll find reasons to attack anyone who comes up with a reasonable a objection rather than addressing the actual technical issues.
For anyone that doesn't remember, Mike's wonderful getutxo patch was attacked within hours of being merged to Bitcoin Core 
Mike drove a bad idea despite of extensive peer review which spoke to the contrary and he eventually got the patch merged only by extensive bullying (much like the bullying that is going on today). Mike's response to getting his patch removed was to go running to the press and declare how fragile bitcoin was the very next day after devs reverted his patch.
Plain and simple, you are being mislead about Bitcoin-XT. The Bitcoin Core developers know what they are doing much better than most people here on r/bitcoin who are cheering for this coup. If this goes ahead it will be very destructive to the bitcoin ecosystem in ways you cannot conceive.
I never thought in my wildest dreams that the real attack on bitcoin would come from within the very community of bitcoin cheerleaders who want it to succeed.
Very sad. This is not the way to get consensus, this is the path of destruction. 
Fortunately, the likely outcome of this episode is for Gavin and Mike to make themselves irrelevant by failing to get others on board and we can go back to business as usual.

It is the equivalent of the Spanish inquisition. The development community are the ones with the technical expertise. Gavin wants to throw them in the dustbin because "he's right, and everyone else is wrong".
I frankly dont give a toss if Coinbase or OKCoin are pro 20MB blocks, the fact remains they are not as qualified to make that choice as the development team are *collectively* (who have been working on bitcoin by consensus for years) let alone r/bitcoin. Gavin and Mike are either mad, or want to intentionally destroy bitcoin. Frankly, I am leaning towards the latter because we have almost textbook disruption techniques going on including a I believe a social media sybil attack. 
I cant believe two intelligent people like Gavin and Mike can be so pig headed and destructive. I cant believe they can be so snide and manipulative too.

All of which would be devastating to the general public's acceptance of Bitcoin. Such a clusterfuck would have to be avoided at all costs. Either near 100% of the network upgrades to GavCoin or they dont bother. Not something in between. Anything less than real consensus will ruin bitcoin (remember it's not just the miners that have to upgrade in a hard fork, it's all the validating nodes too). 
When it comes down to it, there's real money on the line and I really doubt big companies whose income relies on a stable bitcoin ecosystem will play economic stand-off, they will side with whatever they believe the majority will side with to avoid loss.

This is exactly correct. You are the one misrepresenting  and dont even explain why you object to what he has said. 


This is correct because there is absolutely no consensus and not even a pull request to increase the block size yet people behaving like it's a done deal. It isnt: I get this simply from following discussions on the mailing list and IRC channels. All of it is logged, so I would appreciate you finding quotes to prove your point, otherwise you are being intellectually dishonest.


This again is true, the general public have been rallying as if they are being denied a simple fix to a complex problem. Bitcoin does not scale, this is probably the first time the general public have really come up close and personal with discussions that have been ongoing for *years* in development channels.
The very reason hub and spoke payment channels and Lightening Network were even thought of was as a direct result of developers in this space trying to find a way to tackle bitcoin's fundamental scalability issues.

Well if anyone wants to fork Bitcoin, it's Gavin. Since the maximum block size almost certainly isnt going to change to 20MB any time soon, there is nothing for the current Bitcoin Core developers to do, except address the real issues at hand, which are not about block size, but about protocol issues which need to desperately be fixed and improved so that better layer 2 technology can be deployed. MBS is at best a big distraction at the current time when we need to be concentrating on more pressing issues.
@_date: 2015-05-29 00:18:32
Think about it like this. Bitcoin transactions are basically electronic cheques that get recorded on the blockchain. You sign them with your digital signature. That's how the network can work out who has what money, and whether a transaction is valid. Normally these have to be broadcast to the network and confirmed by miners.
Zoom in a little, these "cheque" say "only Bob can spend these funds, signed Alice". That right there is actually a Bitcoin script, aka smart contract (because it's self enforcing).
The reason we normally have to wait for confirmations in the blockchain is to prevent Alice paying Bob, then immediately "double-spending" that payment back to herself and hoping the network will confirm the refund first (and reject the original payment).
This is where multisignature transactions come in. Say we have a multisig address that requires both you and I to sign for the payment to be valid, imagine there is 10 BTC in there. We talk between each other and I agree to sign a payment for 10 BTC to you. If I give you that transaction, in order for you to spend it, you must also sign it. But at the moment I hand you the transaction (offchain) it's actually yours because there is no way I can go back on the payment (short of boshing you over the head).
All you need to do is sign the payment and broadcast it to the bitcoin network. Yes it will take time to confirm, but the point is, the payment can be considered final at the point I sign my half.
So Lightning takes this a step further so you can have multiple parties all able to move money around (in a similar fashion). You'd settle up on-chain periodically but for all intents and purposes, just signing a transaction and giving it to someone can be considered an instant payment.
This is grossly over simplified, trying to ELI5. But does it make any sense yet?

You called the top, no squeeze and shorts are higher than when we started the discussion yet the price is lower.

I dont know where the bottom is, but it's clear short levels are not going to tell us that either. This bear trend could go on for a long time yet, or it might end real soon, no-one knows. Seems to me like we're getting more down slowly. Markets dont move in straight lines.

Writing code is the least of the problem. Designing systems that work, are robust and secure from exploitation requires a lot of navel gazing and discussion among peers.

The problem is he is making technical proposals, so they should be made in the right place. I'm pretty sure even businesses with a vested interest in bitcoin follow the mailing list, or certainly their CTOs do. Instead what we have gotten is a campaign that focuses attention towards mainstream users who may not be in possession of all the technical background and the rational discussion becomes defuse so the experts in the field spend their days battling hundreds of posts and trying to explain things to a non technical audience. 
I'm not saying people shouldnt discuss this in places like Reddit, but Gavin hasnt even made a concrete proposal. He's taken the development process away from it's usual home and onto a dozen forums. 
How is it right that core developers have to spend time fighting a media storm instead of having focused technical discussions? I'm probably not being as eloquent as necessary but I hope you get the point. It's like he's lobbying the court of public opinion in order to bypass the normal development process.
Another way of putting it - what is the point of lobbying 1000 people who do not have the technical expertise to even make an educated decision on this matter vs lobbying peers who do?

What is the difference between implementing something like Zerocash as a sizechain vs an altcoin? The only different I understand would be how the tokens come into being since all the rest can be achieved with an altcoin, including the merged mining side. As I understand it. As I understand it, merged mined sidechains would potentially be less secure than merged mined altcoins because there is a potential attack incentive introduced by the pegging. The only hard part of merged mining is getting enough miners to agree to mine in the beginning to stop a CoiledCoin like episode.
So my question is to try an understand the advantages of a sidechain coin vs an altcoin coin.

TDD states you write your tests *before* you write any functional code so your code actually fulfils the requirements.  But for security purposes tests are unlikely to expose security issues, just that your code does what it says on the tin. For example you might have a website login, it functions correctly, passes your tests, but is it secure? Is it free of XSS? Can you inject variables which override your checks? How are your passwords stored? Are there any information leaks? The code for a login is really simple, the security is a nightmare.... now apply this to complex cryptographic system with economic incentives to encourage honesty and you are into a whole new ballpark of pain.

None of this detracts from bitcoin being viable technology but I really do suspect that $116MM+ could have found a better home.

I dont think anyone disagrees that blocksize will probably have to increase at some point. The issues are that it's not actually urgent right now, it doesnt solve scalability itself, and the consequences of raising MBS are actually not well understood and in fact could have a terrible effect on the network and incentives that balance bitcoin's infrastructure.
What actually matters right now is getting things CLTV integrated and fixing malleability so that level 2 protocols can be developed and rolled out, as well as addressing many other issues including exploring the ramifications of increased blocksize in much more detail.

I just read V7 (the version that Roger says is in force), and IANAL but I have signed and negotiated many contracts. What is striking about this agreement is it's missing a few things I always see on contracts:
1. There is no mention of jurisdiction
2. There is no clear definition of who the parties are and no mention of company names. Usually these get abbreviated after the definition, `between OKCoin Pte Ltd, Singapore ("OKCoin") and Mr Roger Ver, Address ("Roger Ver") `.
3. There is no witness to the contract. 
This seems to be a very shoddily drawn up document to be honest and definitely Roger Ver did not employ a lawyer for it. Because of these inconsistencies, it will be very easy for OKCoin wrangle on many technical points. There are quite a few other things wrong with the agreement, but I am just pointing out the glaring mistakes. 
Getting a properly drawn up contract, and executing it correctly prevents exactly this kind of mess from occurring.
If OKCoin's lawyer agreed to this contract then I would definitely be concerned about their legal council.

Satoshi also didn't envision mining pools that could potentially lead to centralisation. Also huge amounts of satoshi's code was later disabled (and still remain disabled) because of security and attack vectors. Satoshi was brilliant, but he was not a god. Do you know that practically none of Satoshi's original code exists today, it was mostly rewritten. The bitcoin you love and enjoy today is only here because of the work of these very devs you say don't understand the incentives and who have quietly saved bitcoin from a few disasters already.

Test what? The issue of digital signatures is not the issue here, it's jurisdiction of the court hearing the case. Many many cases have been thrown out because of jurisdiction. You are in the US, I am in Germany, where do we do battle? and does that court have the ability to enforce the judgement. This is why contracts always specify jurisdiction for where disputes will be heard - you will see it in every contract drawn up by a professional.
The point is, even if you are right, lack of the right "due process" can see you lose or not even be heard. 
Enforcement is yet another hairball of pain, but that's OT.

This is FinCEN, not the SEC. Their complaint is specifically about not having KYC/AML in place, failing to file suspicious activity reports for large transactions and also for acting as an unregistered MSB.

Of course I arrived at these settings scientifically, but this discussion isnt about Viacoin, Gavin, it's very much about Bitcoin and you are handwaving away very valid and well reasoned objections and concerns from highly adept people in this space. 
It is convenient for you to apply logical fallacies here to divert attention away from your poorly reasoned arguments but it's not going to make the fundamental objections to your proposals go away. Only scientific research capable of passing peer review will work. Your fundamental argument in this post is simply for us to ignore the peer review.

bitcoin is not an investment, it is a speculative vehicle. A house or shares are an investment, they can make revenue independently of their price: eg rent and dividends.

In short yes and here's why:
1. Bitcoin market cap is very small so it's easy to push around. 
2. Bitcoin spot markets are heavily influenced by derivative products, like OKCoin's Futures market which are also easy for whales to kick around.
3. We don't know if exchanges are behaving as fractional reserves, we know MtGox has "Willy Bot" who was buying with a fake account balance.
4. Bitcoin markets are very illiquid as it stands. There isnt actually much on the order books.
5. Equally margin trading on centralised exchanges could be allowing naked short selling, we have no way to tell. Sort of part 3.
These answers may not be very popular with bitcoin fundamentalists, but the wonderful benefits of bitcoin's openness and transparency do go away once you involve centralised exchanges. If all trade was don't on the blockchain, certainly much of this could be mitigated.

Well someone created this damn troll thread and we all got stuck in the mixer. I was planning a followup post to the bitcoin dev post to ask what the best way forward would be for the CLTV patch so a PR could be materialised. 






I was referring to the "method signature" of the EvalScript() in the programming API. Maybe we have a terminology mixup.


Sure, but if it wasn't clear, what I meant was I was helping get CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY implemented by funding the final leg of work which required BIP65 and a working PR so it could move to concrete peer review stage. Now that 0.10 has been branched, there is no reason PRs targetted for 0.11 code cant be considered for merge into master. My point is that while viacoin might be it's own project it's actually contributing back to Bitcoin because making Bitcoin better helps the entire crypto scene rather than just leeching off of other people's work.

Fun fact, the first credit card was Diners Club. Now we have VISA and Mastercard and a few others. In the end, cryptocurrencies will look the same. No on product can keep 100% of the market share. You can be damn sure if Zerocash ever comes along, it will take a huge slice out of Bitcoin's pie. 
What is more worrying about this debate is how people fail to grasp that changing a property of bitcoin can have a whole range of knock-on effects and consequences. It's not black and white and every change is a tradeoff.
@_date: 2014-10-25 07:06:34
Much better, haha. But I am afraid I would like to make a terrible prediction. 
From what I understand, merged mined sidechains are going to require majority support from the major pool operators (which I refer to as the making of a cartel). The sidechain mining cartel will decide who can exist (and conversely who dies) as a sidechain, so of course the are unlikely to support "clone of the day" coins.
So clonecoin (or shitcoins as they are known in the "industry"), will continue on just as they have been, nothing will change there, well, not because of sidechains at least.
Anyway, I am a big fan of blockchain interoperability and I think it can open up a lot of new applications. I am personally not convinced about wisdom of employing merged mining but that's another story.
I think it would be wise to address the whole "death of altcoins" meme officially otherwise it is likely to be a thorn you have to deal with repeatedly. Mind you, I also heard people say Ethereum would bring the death of altcoins (because "you can create them with a 4 line contract") and even bitcoin :-P

That's not how the development process works. Until there is developer consensus on what to do, nothing will get merged. Gavin can no-more set a timeline than you or I can. What is needed is a clear and convincing plan that addresses all the concerns raised as opposed to handwaving away concerns. This may not be a popular answer, but, it is the truth. I have lost count of the number of ideas that have been raised which to me seemed like good ideas, only to see counter arguments considering all sorts of things I never considered even possible. One thing we cannot do it just change things and see what happens, that could be disastrous and it's very unscientific.
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:49:32
As I said, I am not convinced 24 seconds scales, I was giving this because I have actual experience with this which is better than an opinion based on what sounds reasonable. 1 minute blocks are also probably not optimal.
I don't follow your arguments regarding security. The overall network hash is what matters, it's not diluted by more frequent blocks. But more frequent blocks *do* increase orphans and that must be factored in. I am on the side of decreasing the interval of blocks *if it makes sense*. I defer to people who are much more experienced and clever than myself to make those judgements. I have a feeling it's not as simple as we'd all like to think, just as increasing blocksize might sound reasonable but actually isnt a simple affair.
As for how much security, on my own blockchain we're running at about 70% of litecoin's hashrate, which considering is all ASIC based is pretty secure for scrypt, but that's really not the point of this discussion.
@_date: 2015-05-07 11:56:35
What utter nonesense. Do you actually follow the development process, do you read the hundreds of PR discussions that are merged between releases. Do you read the mailing list at all? Clearly you don't.

I would also like to point out that OKCoin.com Intl (the international USD site in Hong Kong) now has leveraged futures contracts which also have a pretty significant effect on spot market price. 
I know Chinese exchange are a bit of a sticky topic here, but for those that dont know, OKCoin created a USD exchange which unlike okcoin.cn, has trading fees. I believe their spot market has the same fee structure as Bitfinex, and futures have contract fees. They also have p2p lending like Bitfinex.
The markets are usually influenced most when it comes to futures contract settlement time which is on Friday on OKCoin.
You can see sentiment index and open contracts here (1 contract is $100 worth of bitcoin at index price)

FWIW I am long term bull on bitcoin but!...
Careful: 25k swaps are active, meaning people have reserved them. It doe not mean they are being used in a position. You can reserve swap at preferential rates (sub 0.01%) waiting for a good time to actively short. Bitcoin market is in trouble right now, do not expect a big rally to change things. The trend is your friend. We're already at &gt;38% fib retrace back to the bottom of $255. Bitstamp coming online might give us a bit of a pump. We have all been expecting a squeeze but so far short swaps just keep increasing. The market is conditioned to just look for short entry points, meaning when the price rises, people see that as a shorting opportunity. For a squeeze to happen we'd need at least $320 and at high velocity. The rise since the weekend is at strong risk of simply confirming the downtrend as we currently retrace. Frankly, even if we do squeeze, it would not be enough to change the trend - *shorters are just going to reshort the top*. Don't be surprised if we go below $200 in the coming weeks or months even if this does squeeze.

Regarding 2b) is trying to make the point which I think bitcoin maximalists religiously miss, that it is impossible for any product to get 100% of the market. It's just not how it works. A few real world examples:
Diners club was the first credit card, but now the world is dominated by Visa and Mastercard and a few others which all offer exactly the same service. 
During the crazy bubble of late 2013 bitcoin was seen as too expensive (to own a whole bitcoin) so people started buying litecoins and tons of other alts too. It's just how market perception works. Big business has cottoned on to this and realise the only way to get bigger market share is to own competing brands so the consumer has the illusion of choice.
To me it's stupid, I am sure to you also it seem daft, but it's just how markets work.

This is part of the problem as far as the contract goes. There is no clear definition of who the contract is between (no registered entities are listed, and no addresses, that goes for both Roger and OKCoin), no mention of jurisdiction (and a bunch of other standard form), and the contract is not witnessed either. The contract (even the V7) appears to have been written without assistance of a lawyer and worse, OKCoin don't appear to have had a lawyer read over it (because no lawyer would sign off on a contract missing standard form). For all these reasons I wouldnt expect this to even be able to be herd in a court letalone enforced.
I find this rather frustrating because the purpose of getting things in writing is to make it clear so disputes can easily be remedied... in this case, there may as well not have been anything written down as the contract was quite obviously thrown together by someone with no legal training which is a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:21:44
I wasn't dodging anything. The people questioning were just trying to goad me into divulging more information with petty "prove it" arguments - clearly many of you think differently now. The signs of a company in distress are evident to anyone with even a passing knowledge of risk management. I chose the route of explaining the signs of risk rather than exposing scandal.
I may post a followup if I find the time. But all of you who left Bitstamp because of my post, you are welcome. And those who didnt, that was your decision, you own it. 
The fact bitstamp to this day still do not use multisig cold storage is a clear indication they either dont take security seriously, or worse, do not understand basic security protocols. So while their cold storage was not compromised, it exposes the fact if they dont follow a really simple protocol for cold storage, how bad is their security protocol for hot storage? That is a good example of risk assessment.
I find r/bitcoin trying at times because the pattern is anyone talking badly about what is considered to be a bitcoin hero, will get downvoted and censored to oblivion, until people get burned, when it turns into a public lynch mob. 
We've seen this over and over. MtGox, Bitstamp, Xapo, Coinbase, Neo&amp;Bee. In each one of these cases people got downvoted for complaining about them, until suddenly the pack turned against for whatever reasons (Bitstamp's fees, hack and unique KYC/AML; Coinbase's big brother attitude, cancelling accounts and orders; Xapo's free to use debit card that wasnt).

Here's a comparison chart between BTC/USD and LTC/USD.
I dont know if you misunderstood what I said, but it was that there is a correlation to bitcoin price with alts. When BTC goes into bull run (making BTC safe to hold), money flows into alts. Bitcoin is bleeding out at the moment, it's not safe to hold in terms of USD value, so there is consequently less interest in alts which with few exceptions are traded in terms of BTC.

If we changed to 1 min block that's effectively a 10MB, 10 min block.
Reducing block rate will already increase orphan rate, and making shorter interval blocks larger will increase the orphan rate even more. There may be incentive attacks that open up due to larger orphan rate.
The risk of reorgs will increase so the number of confirmations required to be considered safe would go up considerably (10x).
Therefore reducing block rate would not result in linear throughput increase.

It does because without a token of value there is no incentive to mine and secure the network It's the secret sauce than makes decentralized consensus work.
At the moment there is quite a lot of incentive but when mining subsidy drops much lower which will happen in 9 years, then the incentive for miners will have to come from fees. Obviously if the price of bitcoin goes down significantly it will change the security dynamics.

Two "objections". Can't send a few satoshis on the bitcoin protocol... then there are miner fees. Secondly the amount of energy you expend would be ridiculous compared to just buying the satoshis in the first place.... then there is battery drain, but that's a third complaint.

Well, unless you know something about the design of bitcoin that no-one else does, I really dont know what to say in reply. Removing the block limit absolutely does not fix scalability issues, it simply kicks the can down the road until we reach limits again at the risk of changing the dynamics and incentives of running bitcoin, including promoting fees. No-one disagrees that MBS will probably have to increase at some point, but if you think you can ramp up to VISAs 7000tps just by increasing block size, you're in for a rude awakening.

Swaps are a fancy name for a loan in a CFD contract. Short swaps are BTC loans, long swaps are fiat loans. The loan can only be used for trading. In a short swap you sell the BTC you are loaned hoping to buy back cheaper. You pocket the difference and return the coins + some interest.

I am working on assumption that Bitstamp has enough bankroll and investors who will make users whole (but not that Bitstamp can survive long term). It will certainly be hard for the market to be decisive with stamp offline, but there are probably more chances of a rally when it comes online. That's why lots of people are waiting on the sidelines to short. I genuinely believe a lot of short swaps in the 24k stats are just waiting with reserved margin, waiting for a possible rally to short near the top. For margin traders it would be safer to wait for Bitstamp to return before taking a bet.
Certainly interesting times ahead, that's for sure! Never a dull day with Bitcoin!

This is what I have called the 0.1% attack. Not sure how the war would play out, but in theory miners want to get paid, so they will mine the fork that has a fiat exit attached. It would require all major exchanges to collude and have a stand-off with the miners. Users would probably follow suit. Dangerous game and would probably be infinitely harmful to confidence in the currency.

Terrible idea. Everyone should be using the reference client because it is the protocol spec. If people want to customise the rules, customise from the reference client.

"work just fine" is unfair because those quoted coins do not have the transaction volume of Bitcoin - the blocks remain tiny and therefore propagation latency isnt an issue. Scale those up to 1MB blocks and the metrics would look different. As someone who has been experimenting with faster block times, I can assure you it's not a walk in the park unfortunately.

Here is a simplified example  which shows how hundreds of payments can be made off-chain using only two onchain transactions, one to open the channel, and the other the close it. This can get a lot more complex, you can look at Lightening Network for really complex possibilities powered by a new opcode called OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. These are all examples of smart contracts.

Better position entry. Beginners always short as the market is going down or worse, after the market has already tanked on that wave. Seasoned traders look for an overall downtrend or other signals and wait for a failed rally (which will subsequently drop). Wouldn't you rather short at the top of a hill or at the bottom of it?
This is the meaning of Warren Buffet's buy when other are fearful and sell when others are greedy statement. When people were buying BTC yesterday as Bitstamp came back online, the experienced traders were placing short sells up high. You can see the result 12 hours later.

If you would read what I said: there is no bitcoin protocol written down. The protocol *is* the reference client. Therefore including every single edgecase defining consensus is not going to be easy for any parallel implementation. 
Development "forks" should be made off the main client and customised. It becomes a systemic issue if other implementations become popular and one of them has a consensus bug because they missed an edge case in the reference client. I believe there have already been serious issues with other implementations, but fortunately they are not widely deployed at this time.
Bitcoin Core is slowly being split up, so there will be libraries for other implementors: that means things like libconsensus can be reused across projects and stem the very objection I outline above.

Well the problem with embedded consensus systems is contracts between internal tokens and the main chain token (bitcoin) cannot be enforced automatically. Concrete example, on Counterparty's decentralised exchange you can place bids and asks. If both sides of the trade are Counterparty created tokens, settlement can just be done by the protocol. If one of the sides of the trade is BTC, then the settlement has to be done manually. It's not ideal.

The argument "we will do no evil" is not a protection. A company can be bought out, systems hacked, taken over etc., government orders... etc. And as for incentive, you can profit in either direction (margin short). The big revolution of bitcoin is making systems where participants cant be evil - that was Satoshis vision of 1 CPU 1 vote. Unfortunately he did not predict ASICs and mining centralisation due to payout variance.

The blocksize debates has been going on since 2011 from what I can tell but those bitcoin developers have had the same opinion since then, long before the advent of Blockstream which is less than 1 year old.
I also don't know if you noticed, but Blockstream just hired and sponsored the Lightning Network project which would help bitcoin scale up orthogonally. Yet Lightning Network developers have all said they would need larger blocks eventually.

I personally would love it if it were possible to increase the block rate, but here are some thoughts:
If we changed to 1 min block that's effectively a 10MB, 10 min block.
Reducing block rate will increase orphan rates, and making shorter interval blocks larger will increase the orphan rate even more. There may be incentive attacks that open up due to larger orphan rate.
The risk of reorgs will increase so the number of confirmations required to be considered safe would go up considerably (10x?). My experiments with 24 second block intervals gives 100 orphans per day (measured, but also with much smaller blocksizes) and that a 10 block reorg is feasible.
Higher orphan rate means wasted hash power and less security.
Reducing block rate would not result in linear throughput increase.
Regardless of these thoughts, there may be a happy medium, for example 5 min blocks? I think it is worth investigating.
@_date: 2016-01-24 04:36:24
Very well said. Let me add some background:
The point of Slack is not to replace the IRC platform for the developers (who are comfortable there). There are no plans to move development from IRC either.
The Slack group was created to help facilitate the greater community and also businesses to get closer contact with some of the developers of Bitcoin Core with the understanding that IRC is too obscure and hard to use for most users.
Slack has the network effects, good mobile app and web interface, and it already in wide use by business people especially (who are complaining about lack of communications). It's therefore an ideal platform in the multi-pronged roll-out of "better communications".
The success of the Slack group is testimony to users' desire for more contact and I sincerely believe a little modernising will facilitate further harmony.

I am someone who has expressed concerns about some aspects of Blockstream but I have to say your assertion that Blockstream isn't logical.
Firstly, Greg has held the same views about block size for years (long before Blockstream came along). Secondly, maximum blocksize (MBS) is orthogonal from sidechains as they are just a way to deploy a blockchain with different properties. The most exciting and efficient scaling possibilities arent even possible by sidechains (blockchains). Smart contract systems like Lightening Network proposals would allow Bitcoin to scale in an way increasing MBS cannot deliver.

@_date: 2015-05-08 12:16:00
Anything that involves decentralised a consensus driven blockchain is not going to scale like payment channels. If sidechains are blockchains they just serve to take transaction volume off the bitcoin blockchain to the sidechain's blockchain.
The clever part of smart contracts is they can go off-chain, entirely, not off to another blockchain. The smart contract ends with net settlement yet could have involved hundreds of participants all of which retained cryptographic control over their funds.

I am not entirely convinced everyone voting has read the technical debates on the mailing list, nor actually considered the tradeoffs beyond the skewed tabloid representation being presented to the general public by Gavin and Mike. In many cases the details are being severely misrepresented and oversimplified. People are getting hysterical as if it's an "all or nothing", "if you don't act now bitcoin will die". I see parallels with how overbearing anti-terrorism legislation and other draconian laws get forced down our throats. "Think of the children" &lt;panic&gt; &lt;panic&gt;.
It's made worse by the flurry of fanatical down-voting and name calling that even makes other rational points of view invisible.
People need to take a step back and realise this is not about public opinion, this is about complex technical trafeoffs. Not a simple binary decision. 
The most striking thing missing from debates is that raising block size doesn't actually solve the problem, bitcoin doesn't scale and unless we actually address that we'll be here again. This is why even the dynamic blocks idea is ultimately problematic... and as block size scale up, other issues begin to appear.

This shows that consensus development is working. Bad ideas get rejected, good ideas get adopted. Don't think some PRs don't take time to reach consensus, or get turned upside down, Peter Todd has a PR which took more than a year to get merged. Lots of PRs get closed in favour of a drastically different proposal because the consensus process found a better way.
This is the very point. But Gavin and Mike come marching in here stropping that bitcoin cant reach consensus when what they mean is their idea is controversial and unlikely to be accepted.
Let's not forget it Gavin was considering forking bitcoin with Mike:

Neither "bitcoin ultimate" or an "official bitcoin software" exist. The most popular full node in use today (by a long way) is Bitcoin Core. If you want the features in Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 you will need to run that version.

Anything is possible, but people are allowed to change their minds. The height of human intellect is the ability to reassess opinions based on evidence.
I know of many staunch disbelievers of the Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap have since come around after much deep thought and consideration. It's a complex topic with lots of disinformation, so I would commend anyone who after consideration is willing and able to change their opinion (in either direction).
Jiang Zhuo'er has certainly been known for strong opinions against segwit and so on, but that really doesn't preclude him changing his mind.
Technically though, it would be difficult to "accidentally" signal segwit. Unlike other soft forks, it requires more than just upgrading the Bitcoin node. It requires patching the mining pool software so that it will write the witness commitment (which his coinbase transaction seems to have).
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:44:19


No, adoption is trending up by every metric there is (node, company adoption, downstream software projects). Miner signalling is not representative of adoption, or community wishes. Miner signalling has traditionally been used as a "safe" trigger for activation.
I moved the top chart (2k) to the bottom with the other chart (10k) because I wanted to add the segwit logo to the page and that would push the entire project list below the fold. The list is the most interesting part of the page, not the miner signalling. I also added links to other resources, including  which is run by Samourai Wallet.

Yes, it's going to be fantastic that these shady practices come to an end, but I disagree with your last comment, let me explain.


They haven't. There are existing regulations which govern "continuous trading" and margin trading, both which require a license (cant find the link atm). Bitcoin exchanges are operating illegally, however, it's normal in China to allow businesses to operate in the grey, neither clamping down, nor legitimising them.
If the PBOC was actually legitimising Bitcoin exchanges they would have either taken punitive action, or would have request they C&amp;D pending getting a license, or granted a temporary waiver pending license application - that's how it would work in the west. Instead, exchanges have scrambled to "self-regulate" (shutting down margin and adding fees) and hope the PBOC continue to turn a blind eye to enforcement according to existing regulations.
I believe that the PBOC neither want to shut down exchanges nor legitimise them. If they shut them down, Bitcoin would be driven 100% to OTC trading, and PBOC would lose any leverage in dampening exuberance as they have done twice so far. If they legitimise Bitcoin by licensing exchanges then it would assist Bitcoin, a system which could become an issue for capital flight in the future. So the Chinese way is, leave it in the grey and come out menacing every now and again. That spectre will keep things somewhat under their control.
It will be interesting to see how things play out after fees are implemented and how much the market changes or not. China has been attributed with a lot of the exuberance. The lack of margin trading will greatly reduce Chinese liquidity. It doesnt mean that margin will go away of course, since private individuals can still loan BTC and CNY to traders, so it remains to be seen how much it will affect really large players.
It must also be noted that services like OKCoin futures (and margin trading) in Hong Kong are not affected. OKCoin Intl already has maker taker fee structure and fees on futures trading and is considered by many as a big driver of price. I also imagine a lot of the margin liquidity will simply transfer to places that offer those facilities.
Interesting times ahead for sure.

Yes, that's exactly why I would have gone to the High Court, because the bank is a creditor.

He means at a single location. He's referring to the new 135MW facility being built in Xinjang.  
The facility is meant to house many different miners, but his point is having so much in one small location is a systemic risk - from governments, fires, powercuts, "acts of god", war, ghosts and gremlins. Physical decentralisation is an important to protect against these issues.

If pools did their bit for segwit activation, there would be an immediate drop in fees because of increase blockspace. I suggest complaining to the pool operators. Assuming miner signalling, we could have this in just 4 weeks under the current activation trigger.

IANAL but I'm pretty sure there are laws governing that and if they cant prove. They dont have random civil asset forfeiture rights. I'm failrly confident any actual seizure is done according to the Proceeds of Crime Act (which has a due processl) and that if you can prove the legitimacy, you're ok. I think the problem is normally people don't escalate and work within the frame set by the bank (i.e. the only complaint avenue is through the bank itself). A court case would force the bank to prove it or refund the money. Default judgements are fun ;)
I don't believe the UK legal system has become _that_ broken yet that banks can just summarily arbitrarily take your money without being held to account.

You only have to look at the result of an netsplit in 2013 to realise what will happen. But unlike 2013 which was a bug (introduced by Mike Hearn's patch and missed by peer review), participants quickly rallied to fix the problem - because there was complete consensus on what to do. Good luck with a fork that occurs at 50%-75% (&lt;75% if there is hostility towards XT).
Game theory is very strong in this and there are definite power struggles that could happen, but the problem is in almost all circumstance, everyone loses. The best outcome would be for XT to fail to gain anything more than a minority stake and to lose.
Remember though, Mike has promised to force the network split if they dont gain majority by using checkpoints. Draw your own conclusions from that.

The way nLockTime works at the moment is nLockTime prevents a transaction being included in a block at all which limits the usefulness: cant prove an output is unspendable; you cant write any scripts leveraging it. 
nSequence is it thought to have been intended to allow orderly transaction replacement, the higher wins - although there was never any consensus rule enforcing this. BIP68 introduces a consensus rule to enable this feature in such a way as to allow relative locktime. You can read about it here 
The opcodes allow scripts to evaluate the locktime from within a transaction included in the block and prove an output is unspendable. CSV starts the timer relative to when the output is included in a block and CLTV is an absolute threshold.

@_date: 2015-08-19 13:43:04
Actually it did receive some peer review on the developer mailing list and problems were robustly ignored. On that basis alone, XT is not ready for release. Additionally XT was also released with a block versioning scheme that goes against established conventions and follows an as yet undecided versionbits scheme, this was done so without adequate peer review or feedback and is causing extra work for Bitcoin Core developers to work around this. That in itself is a good example of how XT breaks even the most rudimentary standards of technical consensus building. It's simply wreckless.

@_date: 2015-08-21 03:18:32
You fundamentally misunderstand the difference. There's a difference in forking software because you want to add features, fix bugs etc compared to changing the consensus rules.
Bitcoin cannot exist with more than one set of consensus rules. If you change the consensus rules, everyone must follow or the network splits. If the split is large enough it will destroy value in the entire system. That's why the network needs unanimous consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-24 11:12:00
It's going to be harder to know what are Bitfinex addresses as time goes on because they are using multiple addresses (all customers have HD wallets now).

Note the current maximum vote is a 10% change for that window. It could be less too, given it's just a two week period. The other question is really what the penalty should be exactly. I didnt specify this yet, I've just said by "proportion". That could mean 10% change vote requires n * 10% increase, where n &lt;= 1.
I dont believe the retargetting penalty has to be huge, any rise will make the miner think twice and that's the point.
With BIP100 for example, a miner can vote for an increase for free and that means they could get paid on the side to vote. Under my scheme miners are only going to vote when there is a real need to do so, and much more likely to collaborate. All that matters is that blocksize can be increased according to demand, and without players being able to game the system without penalty.
Under Satoshi's scheme, miners were never given free reign because fully validating nodes keep them honest. A scheme where miners could alter the blocksize without negative consequence to themselves would be a dangerous scheme.
Regarding Meni's proposal, I prefer spending difficulty target rather than bitcoins as a penalty because difficulty is less predictable and better defends against out of band mining contracts.
Regarding "free votes", in the grand scheme of things, miner luck evens out, so I dont see why it would be a problem.

The key to understanding the problem is there is no formal Bitcoin Consensus Protocol specification from which implementations can reference (which would have a set of tests that could be applied, remembering different tests may pass or fail depending on different hardware). Instead, the specification is the reference client itself, which is Bitcoin Core.
That makes it a lot more difficult for alternative implementations to get it right, because they have to fathom the code and even the idiosyncrasies of whatever flavour of C++ is being used. It also means that any bugs that exist in Bitcoin Core are also part of the consensus rules. There are examples of this in the scripting language for example.
I believe it is now considered too late to be able to migrate the specification to a specification which clients could follow, but Bitcoin Core's alternative approach is to split out the consensus rules a consensus library so it will be easier for other implementations to re-use the consensus library. That would, in theory, make it safer for alternative implementations to "get it right".

Try making any reasoned arguments against XT and see what happens. You'll see first hand.
To answer your question about 75% of XT blocks there has been a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and also on twitter about how miners could deliberately fake block versions to trigger a fork in those who had upgraded to XT. Imagine that happened when they thought they had 75% but actually only 10%...

@_date: 2015-08-25 08:56:08
Amusingly enough, BIP101 by Gavin doesnt take into account the 32MB p2p message size limit either, so while his proposal claims to scale from 8MB to 8GB it infact will get stuck at 32MB anyway, requiring another hard fork.
For those that are not aware, the protocol used by Bitcoin to communicate between peers has a limit of 32MB messaging.

If the phone isnt rooted it's much safer, but the greenaddress model is safer because it requires another signature. You have to make tradeoffs between each of use and security. For example you could store your coins in a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet (from bitaddress.org) and transfer some smaller amount using Mycelium wallet for spending (as they have easy cold storage spending option).

Basically, Chinese are investors by culture, any money they take out of the stock market will have to go somewhere. I'm willing to speculate some of that will go into bitcoin / litecoin, just like they did during the 2013 Nov bubble.

We just need a simple way to hedge volatility now. Something like bitreserve so the person at the other side can cash out their BTC at the same price it was sent (remembering you might send money to someone today but they cant cash it out till later, by which time the price could have moved significantly against them).

@_date: 2015-08-25 23:44:25
Gavin's original idea was 20MB blocks. The Chinese pools pushed back and said they would find anything bigger than 8MB difficult. So Gavin "compromised" by making his proposal 8MB, but added doubling to 8GB on top.

Here's a cold hard truth. Consumers are going to keep using credit cards because of the consumer protections. If you pay by card you have some comeback.
Remember in 2013 when BFL failed to deliver miners? The people who has paid with bitcoin got shafted, whereas many people who paid by Paypal or Credit card got their money back. For this reason, bitcoin will not replace credit cards for consumers. Bitcoin has it's (large) niche areas and for those it excels.
In the UK those who pay by credit cards get double consumer protection in fact: a) you get chargeback-ability, and b) you can actually hold the credit card company jointly and severally liable if the supplier fails to satisfy your consumer rights (including of they go out of business).

OP, while I appreciate your frustration, the problem is not the pools, but that the protocol allows SPV mining in the first place, or if you want to be more diplomatic, SPV authors should have at lease coded in BIP33 soft forking code...
You should expect miners to be economically rational and that's exactly what they are doing (which is to mine blindly on announced block headers rather than waiting to download and validate the block).

I would like to see a single softfork "locktime feature-pack" consisting of BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY together with BIP68 (which elegantly redefines how nSequence is interpreted allowing for relative locktimes) and another important related change which will be published either today or tomorrow called median-past-timelock, then Bitcoin will be more or less ready for the most advanced payment-channel layers which includes, but is not limited to Lightning Networks.
For anyone not familiar with what these features allow, I'll try to explain briefly: Essentially there would be two new Bitcoin scripting opcodes called CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY which  allow funds to be provable locked (made unspendable) until a fixed time in the future (absolute locktime), or until a certain amount of time has passed after confirmation (relative locktime).
Thus one can create scripts like
 - Until x time, funds are unspendable, after Alice can sign.
 - Until x time, Alice + Bob must sign, but after that time has expired Alice can sign
CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY gives more flexibility, for example in a payment channel, the clocks can start ticking when payments confirm, rather than from predefined times in the future. This can allow payment channels to be open for unlimited amounts of time for example.
I would like to stress that these opcodes are quite independent of Lightning Network and payment channel, but are a good example of what kind of things they empower. We've already seen some exciting payment channel implementations like Stremium, but with these opcodes, we can begin to see vastly more advanced use-cases. 
In terms of how long it takes to get this stuff into Bitcoin? The code is ready and just needs to progress through normal peer review. BIP65 was merged already. There is a PR for BIP68, and the PRs for CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and median-past-timelock will follow very shortly by The last soft-fork took 4.5 months to be activated. For this reason, I sincerely believe we can see these features fully activated and available in about 6 months assuming peer review doesn't through up any deep "gotchyas".

If you know your rights, you can tell the idiot on the other side of the phone you want to speak to the supervisor and tell them what your rights are.
But it seems like you're trying to comfort yourself that somehow it's hard to reverse a SEPA transfer. It's not hard, and there are scammers preying on people every day. If you do business a lot you might take occasional loss as part of your risk, but dont ever convince yourself you are somehow safe or that the problem couldnt escalate to causing severe damage.
Basically, a BTC takes 6 confirms, ie. 1 hour to be considered irreversible for most purposes. SEPA takes 10 days to reach that state.

Wrong, not everyone has to upgrade to the next major version for a consensus change and those running mission critical systems will stay on the previous stable version and simply upgrade when maintenance versions come out for that version. Even those who do upgrade to the latest major release are likely to wait until at least the first maintenance version before risking upgrade.
When a consensus change needs to get rolled out, as happened with BIP66 the changes are backported to all branches allowing conservative users the ability to upgrade just that feature without changing major version. In the case of BIP66 this took 4.5 months and could happen a lot faster than this if there was a real emergency.

This new scripting language opcode allows bitcoins to be made provable unspendable for a fixed time (relative to when the transaction is confirmed in the blockchain).

A post the ML a couple of days before a final release of an implementation is not a BIP. Nor is it remotely collaborative with the rest of the ecosystem.  Look at BIP65, 68 or 112 as recent examples.. those are BIPs. discussed for long periods of time, lots of _technical_ feed from stakeholders. A working implementation that is given time for multiple stakeholders to review, consider, mull and test. Deployment is the last step, Gavin just posted a mail for something he'd already summarily decided he was going to push, regardless of what anyone thought. He even had the audacity to _lie_ about exchanges and miners testing his code. And then endorse and encourage Sybil attacks on the network. What rot. Gavin is an embarrassment to himself and to engineering in this space.

We have work on the soft fork logic and tests next, but this stage of "mempool-only" also allows downstream users to experiment and test more.

None of that is important. How the markets behaves is all that matters, not the factors that may or may not influence behaviour (e.g. feeling depressed/euphoric so that influenced your trading). A more valid observation would be to say bot/algo behaviour is also present on the tape but I think you are missing the subtly of the observation since bot/algos ultimately react to human behaviour, so can be seen as an amplification of that. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:38:01
Remember the price chart and volume are an exact record of the human behaviour for a given asset. Therefore, just like an EEG, ECG you can tell a lot about what the market has been doing and the sentiment. It's a powerful tool if you know how to read it, but in general the "retail" respective is obvious bs. BollingerBands are an interesting indicator, run on the market data and very accurately indicate when markets are under consolidation and when they are likely to make a move out of that range (but not necessarily the direction). There's no particular voodoo, it's just a way of visualising the data.

@_date: 2015-07-15 17:11:40
Yeah I have to agree with you disagreeing with Peter on this. Even though you'd technically need to wait for more confirmations to get the same amount of security (6 confirms for BTC and 24 for LTC), overall the experience would be a lot better since very few things really need the full 6 confirms. Most exchanges now require just 3 confirms for Bitcoin transactions and 6 for Litecoin (which has 2.5min confirm) and it's absolutely good enough for their purposes, which let's face it, is the most risky of all.
If the future is instant confirmation via lightning network hubs, great, that's even better, but I think Bitcoin could do with at least halving the time to 5 mins at the very least, which immediately increases blocksize capacity as a consequence.
The reality is a single 10min confirmation in bitcoin can take up to and hour, whereas if you have a 2.5min blocktime a long confirmation is 10-12 mins.

Semver does not fit our model entirely. softforks are deployed in point releases because it is easier to verify due to a smaller changeset in the point release than in a major version release.

Asking questions about Blockstream's influence on Bitcoin development and the wider ecosystem is extremely important for Bitcoin... just as important as questions were regarding the BCF influence on development. Blockstream is even more important because they employ many many more devs. Trying to silence the questions seems suspicious, surely everyone who cares about bitcoin has the right to ask questions without being accused of ulterior motives. If there is nothing to hide then what is the problem?

And down from 3rd to 4th place.. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 22:07:20
Greg, the problem here is not who has commit access, but how consensus is concentrated among BCF and Blockstream. I don't care how altruistic you might be, Blockstream is funded by a lot of investors all who have a say in how Blockstream functions, not to mention the owners of Blockstream. 
Employees of Blockstream are employees of Blockstream plain and simple. They have a contractual obligation to the company. Blockstream easily controls enough of the regular contributors to gain any consensus it wants: gmaxwell, luke-jr, cory, matt, Jorge, Mark, Patrick etc. Now you may claim a ghash.io here, "we arent being evil" but the point is, you can influence your employees because well they are your employees so by default, Bitcoin Core has already come under a 51% attack, maybe just arent exercising the ability yet.
Furthermore, your posts about contributors are a smokescreen, because it's not about "how many people contribute" towards the codebase, but it's all about "*how many* people and *who* are the ones that decide *what* gets merged or not". Currently that's Blockstream and BCF employees. It's not as you suggest about who has commit access, because commits are done by consensus of the "ruling class", not all the plebs like me.
If you truly want to separate the corporate influence from Bitcoin, companies should be donating money for development to a fund which is not controlled by any of the contributing entities so the developers it pays for are not under any contractual obligations to fulfil the wishes of their sponsors.

Thanks for your reply and it's nice learn about some of the mitigation strategies you have employed. It might be nice to talk in more detail about that because this particular issue is something that's come up a few times. I do think it's a bit more complicated because "founders" have a different relationship but it goes a long way to show good faith.
Your post ends with a strange ad hominem conspiratorial attack which suggests either you misunderstand me or I hit a nerve somehow. If it's not clear, I don't doubt you, I've just think it's extremely difficult for Blockstream not to *be seen to be* unduly influencing Bitcoin Core for whatever it wants. You need to separate yourself, your hard work and all that from this particular issue. It's not an attack on you or the other Blockstream devs.
Remember the same things have been said about the BCF, it's nothing new, only that Blockstream employs a lot more than BCF.
I think acknowledging the potential perception issues and addressing how you try to mitigate it is a good start, but casting aspersions is unnecessary and puts you on the defensive which should not be necessary if everything is fine.

Once you take the bitcoin out of the blockchain, it just becomes a distributed database. If there is no mining incentive it cant be decentralised. If you have things like "trusted" miners who have to sign the blocks, then you just have a fancy centralized distributed system... and there are already plenty databases out there which do this. 
The whole point of the blockchain is to achieve distributed decentralized consensus and that is exactly the problem Satoshi solved - with proof of work reward based mining. The token is an integral part of the system.

By nullc's own logic, virtually no-one here on r/bitcoin has the right to ask questions because they aren't major contributors to Bitcoin Core. And even if people are contributing by doing bug testing etc, it's easy to brush them aside because that stuff doesn't show up in metrics. One small example, I spent considerable time testing and debugging the refactored Gitian builder in 0.10 during the development phase yet there's almost no visible footprint to show the world "look I did this". Anyone involved in programming will know debugging and testing usually takes inordinately more time than writing the actual code, and especially with something complex like Gitian (which is an amazing quantum leap forward in deterministic building).
Somehow I need visible metrics to qualify to answer questions. That seems pretty elitist to me.
Overall I dont see why I need to "prove" myself, but I can safe say I have done and keep on doing stuff for Bitcoin, both the bitcoin core project, bitcoin related projects and the bitcoin ecosystem around it. I dont feel compelled to list everything. Nullc pretty much tells me to "go fork yourself if you dont like what we are doing". That's even more elitist because it says "I'm doing what I am doing, and if you dont like it, go away". But for certain things that's exactly what I have done. That's why my own coin project and that's also why I publish and maintain an [addrindex version of Bitcoin Core]( which Counterparty now use (something we pioneered the use of in our own Counterparty fork). ["addrindex" allows one to use the Bitcoin Core full node directly as a blockexplorer API]. Bitcoin Core devs havent been too warm in the past to merging it and fair enough, it's a niche use case.
Clearly I do like bitcoin, care about bitcoin, many of the projects around it and spend considerable time and resources on bitcoin. Remember the matched funding round I did for DarkWallet too?

Can you confirm there are no special arrangements or discounts for "larger players" and liquidity providers?
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:02:31
With all due respect, you clearly don't understand what I said. The moment you replace the distributed decentralised consensus mechanism (which involves mining incentives), you no longer have anything but a distributed centralized database. The moment you centralise things, you lose all notion of irreversible. (centralised includes trusted 3rd parties).
Let me repeat it: the solution Satoshi came up solves a specific problem that has never been solved before and requires all the moving parts to work: the blockchain + proof of work + tokens (the mining incentive). It's this combination that makes bitcoin special because it does away with centralization.
If you are going down the centralized (or trusted parties) route, there are already very efficient distributed database solutions.

You blanket accusation of pettiness is frankly disappointing. Yet another post focuses on the factual inaccuracies floated again and again by Mike. Whether you like it or nor, call it petty or not, that kind of habitual misrepresentation *is very relevant* to the argument. Just look how much time we all need to take rebutting inaccurate claims that are so cavalierly spread like butter. It's his signature and it *should* be highlighted. If people disagree based on verifiable facts, even if interpretation differs it would be one thing, but to outright lie at every opportunity is unacceptable. You should be castigating him for that behaviour, not for me call it out.

The BIP process is about discussion. You definitely put in numbers, dates, figures. You do so to get concrete feedback and reactions and find consensus. Jeff I believe is writing the code for this BIP. If it later gets consensus then a date would be agreed at the time. It might not be clear that BIPs are flexible for a very long time in their lifecycle before they get fixed.

Oh man, there's a long history of it. Twisting arguments, misrepresenting others. I'm sorry but I really dont fancy going through finding specific examples right now. I'm getting to the point where I'm past caring because it appears Mike's plans have lost a ton of traction. 
The difficulty is Mike's arguments often sound reasonable on their face value, unless you are aware of the history of what he's actually talking about, then it takes on a quite different perspective. Some of it gets pretty sinister if you delve deeper.
Anyway, sorry not to be specific this time but of the top of my head you can look how he portray's Gavin's push for p2sh now in the modern light. p2sh was rushed by gavin, politicised and sky was falling urgency. The result was a buggy and inferior proposal that didnt get used for 2+ years. Mike glosses over this and uses it as an example of how we need someone to be like Gavin used to be. It's a more tame example, there's a ton of them, some much more ugly and twisted.

Actually Gavin has censored people, including me, where it really matters and then those discussions are used to misrepresent events later on.
Professionally speaking, Gavin and Mike have consistently resorted to populist tactics and misrepresented the facts in order to manipulate public opinion. They created this quagmire.

Bitcoin as a payment system fails badly when it comes to things like recurring payments and is thus less attractive to business models that rely on them. What is attractive about recurring payments from a business point of view is customers give you their authorisation and you can just bill them on at whatever interval. Set and forget has a completely different attrition rate than requesting money to be paid manually each month.
There are some workarounds one can do using timelocked payment channel scripting, but given you need to prefund for future payments, it makes it non-viable for people who cannot afford (or do not want) to lock up funds for future payments.

USPTO is notorious for granting patents it shouldnt because they dont do a decent job of due diligence.

The difficulty is you are assuming fair play. The tactics of Mike and Gavin have been far from it, employing a variety of strategies to misrepresent those who disagree with them. As a case in point, all this nonesense they peddle about how core developers cant agree on anything and are constantly fighting among themselves; the "conflict of interests"; the "them against us": all of this was precipitated *directly* from Mike and Gavin (which then became a meme). They have been extremely divisive. Once things are polarised like that, outsiders have difficulty seeing the wood from the trees.
Geeks arent good at politics, or dealing with Machiavellian strategies. I for one warned some pretty eminent people in the technical community about what was coming long before this blew up. It's so easy to get painted as a conspiracy theorist, but well, here we are. 
Mike and Gavin's actions are reckless at best, but if it was just a matter of disagreement technically I would agree with you entirely. But it's not. I will not repeat myself here, I've already written about it ad nauseam. It's a very calculated campaign, a dirty one.

I am also quite surprised you support the patenting of ideas and inventions by people who didnt actually invent them. What you're sanctioning in the future is a spurious writ claiming that a competitor "wilfully stole your invention", thus "depriving you of revenue", and invoking the 3x penalty.

Yeah, as I explained in my reply to him, his personal views are irrelevant in the long term because once granted the patents can be enforced against competitors anyway. Even if he doesn't initiate that, his successors could, or shareholders force him to, etc. Once you have investors etc. you are duty bound to their best profit interests, end of story.
Of course it's missing the glaringly obvious bullshit that they claim inventions THEY DID NOT MAKE.

Urgh, I repeated myself several times already yet you say again and again I havent answered your questions. I keep saying my main question, and question it is, not a"attack" as you keep on trying to imply, is about the conflicting interests of a commercial company employing a lot of staff of an open source project to the point where is looks like the commercial company has control over the open source project to the point where is can get whatever changes it wants in and block whatever changes it had issue with. You haven't actually answered how this is not a problem other than to say you as the owner/founder of Blockstream have a contract that protects you if Blockstream does anything you disagree with, which I have difficulty comprehending because by your own words it is your company. Employees != owners.
I did acknowledge some of the information you gave in your reply as being encouraging. You however have gone full out to attack and disparage and it is quite unjustified. You seen awfully angry over not much in particular. I am pretty sure these questions will arise again from time to time just as they did over Gavin and the BCF that's the frustrating nature of forums. I even offered you a suggestion that you formally address this issue.
Clearly this conversation isn't going anywhere and all you can do is hurl abuse which only re-enforces my point about your elitist attitude. Open source is all about giving. It doesnt really matter what the motivation of contributors is or isnt, if it advances the project, fixes bugs and improves testing, it's a win. I am sure most people contributing to open source projects are trying to solve particular issues/add features dear to them. Some of those will be hobbyists, some will be commercial contributors like say Jeff. None of that is problematic so long as the open source project remains independent.
I dont know why you think you have the monopoly on deciding who can and cannot ask questions or be concerned about bitcoin governance. We all can be concerned. Whether we're listened to or have power to change things is quite a different matter.
Lastly you're twisting and reframing (as strawman) much of what I am saying. Just one example I love how you go on about how the jcmorgan patch has issues in it and why havent I fixed them, yet in the very ticket you reference, and in IRC conversations where I asked what the issues you thought were, you say you dont know, but you remember there were some. So far in testing the patch works well for me, for Counterparty and the others who use it without problems now for about 8 months. And yes, I also use it in my altcoin, why is this a problem? The code is as far as I am concerned working, available for Bitcoin 0.10 if you want it in Core, and until such a time is made available for those who want it (and there are many) in my own Bitcoin Core fork. FYI the code was adapted for 0.10 as the jcmorgan patch was for 0.9 codebase and needed some changes so it's not just some copy and paste as you try to make out. There's real work there time and testing went into getting it suitable for 0.10. And yes, there is attribution to jcmorgan in the codebase. Please stop throwing random untruths about.
If you do happen to remember whatever the edge cases were for that particular patch, I would gladly fix it. It's not currently a PR in Bitcoin Core only because there has been very luke warm reception to "yet another index". Fair enough, not complaining, in fact, doing exactly what you said to do, and that is distribute a fork with the feature for those that want it, and there are many who do. Though I would much rather have it in the main tree.
I really really don't see what I have said or done that is so objectionable. Is your anger towards me really justified? Really nullc, I am not out to upset anyone, lest not you, and even after your onslaught. If my questions have hurt you so much I can only suggest maybe deep down I hit a nerve or something or somehow I am not communicating well enough and making myself misunderstood.
Anyway peace.

There are videos of both you and Gavin stating how you are lobbying companies and miners, is that not social? Your blog posts... is that not social? I believe that's how this entire civil war got started...


This is a well oiled subject, you cant rewrite history, Gavin most certainly did not follow the norms. See above.


You released software on the network to deliberately cause a hostile fork. I'm not sure what you call that, but it seems pretty hostile to me, and your tone leading up to the release on the mailing list was very hostile so I can only assume the intention was hostile too. Later videos showed how far you were willing to take things (showing the hostility) when you talked about changing software to ignore the longest chain to force the hand of non-compliant miners...


Maybe it's because you  proposed tor blacklists, redlists, and stated the opinion that there's no problem if full nodes becomes so demanding to run that only large players can do so. You also stated you are the benevolent dictator of XT and you want the same model in Bitcoin Core.


That's a total misrepresentation, but please note it's major players like mining companies that have said whatever solution comes about must have both wide technical consensus *and* be something adopted by Bitcoin Core. It's unfortunate for your position I suppose that the majority of technical contributors to the Bitcoin protocol, choose to do so through Bitcoin Core. Not to also mention the overwhelming technical consensus from those players that BIP101 is a bad idea.
At the end of the day, you seem to always appear making these wild statements that have little basis in reality, or, where they do, you seem to reverse roles. I'm not saying you are lying, but it seems clear your perceptions are very skewed. As a classic example, your rant against the CLTV softfork yesterday where you claimed categorically there was "no technical consensus for a softfork" left pretty much everyone on the mailing list scratching their heads because for all the niggles of softforking methods, there is overwhelming agreement using it to roll out CLTV. Where and how on earth did you get the idea there was "no technical consensus"?
I know it must be frustrating that your plans have not gone as you planned, but it's also part of the process. It's time to stop throwing ill feelings left and right and either accept how things are going or work constructively towards scalability which is a far wider topic than blocksize. Negativity actually slows everyone down and it's impossible to be creative under such duress.
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:41:32
I didn't take any bait, I could smell your leading questions a mile off, but your conclusion is not correct. Coinwallet have not created a fee market because their actions are not a true simulation of real market activities or forces. I think I covered this elsewhere.
Sidechains are othogonal to the debate entirely. Payment channels are bitcoin; LN is a highly optimised, caching layer that improves on what bitcoin can achieve on-chain giving things bitcoin cant, like instant confirmation and scalability that is simply impossible with Bitcoin regardless of the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:46:51
The only thing that's going to fill our blocks any time soon is the next spam attack/stress test. There's plenty time to get the increase right. Rushing is the last thing we need to do. They rushed BIP101 implementation and as a result it will never be accepted even on technical merits alone. There really is no rush, I am sorry, but the whole sky is falling meme is just wrong and purposefully misleading.
@_date: 2015-09-03 23:14:58
That's got nothing to do with it. If I am running a full node and my someone crashes it/attacks it without my permission that's a criminal offence under the Act. It's got nothing to do with Bitcoin at this stage. Simply DDOSing a node with UDP traffic is a criminal offence... in this case the attack effects memory usage to the point of node keeling over. 
Also criminal offences are not sued. An aggrieved party would complain to the police and if a criminal offence is suspected, the Crown will prosecute. Any business affected by the issue would be a prime candidate for a formal complaint.
I might add that just about every country has laws that prohibit hacking, unauthorised access, and denial of service to computer systems and networks. It's just normally hard to prosecute. In this case, assuming coinwallet.eu are probably easily locatable and it seems like they have clearly met the intent part of the Act.

Something needs to replace block subsidy, and fast, within 9 years the block reward will be just over 3 BTC. What people seem to forget is that Bitcoin transaction processing is not free, it's heavily subsidised. Last year I remember Amir saying it was costing roughly $30 per transaction (take the block subsidy and divide by the average number of txs, that's the real cost of transaction processing).
It's not what people want to hear, they want to hear bitcoin transactions can be free to send for the user, or just a few cents, but the reality is the transaction processing will have to come from somewhere else. Transaction fees seem to be a logical place. It means either BTC price needs to get a lot higher, tx volume needs to increase a lot (or a combo of both), or some other way of securing the network will need to be found.
As it stands I believe a free floating fee market is a good thing, but that will require scarcity of block space, otherwise, there wont be any incentive for fees (if the block size increases such there will always be tons of empty space).
That's one of the reasons I am not keen on exponential rises of blocksize. I'm a trader, and to me the assertion that the growth curve will just keep increasing (for tx volume) is absurd. Whether we like it or not, other payment rails will evolve around Bitcoin making it more efficient and solving issues Bitcoin cant (like recurring payments, instant settlement). Other businesses will come along offering more Paypal style services (like Coinbase). All these things will, like it or not come into being, and they will, like it or not, take away on-chain transaction volume. For this reason, even if Bitcoin becomes more and more popular, it does not follow that on-chain transactions will increase at the same rate.
Whatever blocksize scaling solution eventually makes it, I would hope it has a way for size to scale without too much fuss, but without introducing mining attack vectors, and without hurting the chances of a fee market evolving.

Umm, are you *sure* you're talking about me? I don't ever remember repeatedly asking for anyone to step down from anything, well except from the BCF probably. 
But yes, I have asked these questions before about Blockstream and until today, you never mentioned any mitigation strategies in your replies. I dont think it's enough to allay all the risks, but it's definitely a step in the right direction. And no, I am not completely satisfied by your answers because I think you are also brushing aside many aspects of the conflict of interests. I get it, you are probably frustrated and find it offensive that you might be being perceived as being bad for Bitcoin because you actually hold bitcoin very dearly to your heart and have worked on the project for many years. I can only apologise if it seems that way because it's certainly not what I mean about you. You clearly care about Bitcoin extensively and give careful thought and consideration to everything. But I think you fail to grasp how Blockstream's setup could be problematic. Let's not brush away the immense power the company now wields just because you are a good guy.
FWIW, I tend not to reply to ad-hominem attacks because it's a distraction. I fail to see how someone small like me is a threat to anyone, especially someone of your intellect, experience and evidently business acumen because Blockstream is clearly doing very well with or without my questions.
I also don't understand why you think all altcoins are competing with Bitcoin. There is a space for alternatives and niches, not everything is a competition and there can never be one to rule them all - Bitcoin has it's own particular focus and whether anyone likes it or not, there will always be alternatives to anything. I am sure Apple dont like Android, Blackberry etc either...
I think it's wrong of you to say I dont care about bitcoin. I dont need to repeat it but you know very well I do contribute to bitcoin and I also support other "competing" OSS projects. I even maintain a bitcoin core 0.10 "fork" and binaries with the addrindex patch used by Counterparty among others. But see it's not me that is the point of discussion, I really dont matter in the great scheme of things. I am not influential, I cannot be accused of *potentially* strongly influencing or controlling the Bitcoin Core project through a multi million dollar startup company that now employs more than 51% of the major contributors.
How does it look that the ex lawyer of Monsanto now works for the FDA as the Food Safety Czar declaring Monsanto products as being safe (even if they are).
So yes, I do think the onus is very much on Blockstream to prove how they deal with conflict of interest, independence etc. Trust me here, I'm a small voice, but this is something that will come up again just like it happened ad infinitum with Gavin and the BCF.
I personally think that in order to keep Bitcoin Core opensource project free from commercial influence it's important to somehow insulate developers from direct financial relationships with commercial sponsors. On the one hand it's great Bitcoin Core has got all this development funding, but it's happened at the expense of a big degree of centralization. 
Consensus doesn't work when it's aggregated - of course employees of a company are going to work for the company. Of course they are going to be influenced by their employer. And of course the employer is going to expect compliance from their employees. Of course employees are going to push for whatever their company needs. That's why it's good you talk more about the details of mitigation but also we need to accept mitigation only goes so far because the aforementioned are strong considering you have the majority of the consensus.

Miners are bound within a range. If &gt;xMB blocks are going to hurt smaller miners, they are going to hurt anyway with all proposals that have &gt;xMB blocks. What is different here is there is an upper limit, and, there is a risk to increasing the blocksize. Smaller miners, which when grouped make up a large percentage of the miners have the power to downvote any increase in blocksize. This very much encourages collusion to raise the blocksize, from *everyone*. Because the range is bound, miners cant go wild. Because there is a cost, they cant sell their votes. 
The reason for paying difficulty is it's much harder to cost out than a fixed fee. The risk is not finding the block: unless everyone is on the same page. Miners absolutely want larger blocks when overall transaction volume is such there are consistently more fees to collect, but definitely not on the odd occasion where there may be just a few extra transactions, i.e. not without real consistent  transaction growth.
Blocksize can remain optimal under this scheme and not hurt any fee market.

I do disagree we'll be maxing out blocks even if another bubble happens. I'm much more concerned about not getting the locktime package softforked into Bitcoin by mid 2016 than anything else.
If we are engineering Bitcoin based on whatever VCs want to pump their investments, it will be a terrible mistake. Everyone seems to be concerned about investors and bitcoin price. Have we forgotten the libertarian goals? Individual sovereignty? decentralisation so no 3rd party can subject users to censure or seizure? This is what matters much more.
People are being very myopic if they think we wont innovate scalability solutions right right way. Everyone is focusing on changing a parameter of Bitcoin which is known not to scale. All this talk of scaling to 8GB like it's going to turn bitcoin into a competitor of VISA is ridiculous. Bitcoin has fundamental scaling issues, they can be solved we're sure, but not with bigger and bigger blocks. Even though we will need bigger blocks, we need to find out how to engineer the system so the system can still function properly. We went through the same pain just to make 1MB blocks function well on the network. A lot more needs to be done for bigger blocks. We need to be concerned about the future, not making random tweaks and hoping for the best.
@_date: 2015-09-05 11:32:27
In the end, my request is quite simple to the BCF. Gavin's title is extremely misleading and helps him bolster his position of authority which is not helpful for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is meant to be a decentralised system without authority figures and his title makes him sound like he's the chief authority. Gavin deliberately uses this title to further his agenda. The BCF knowingly empowers this. Gavin's title at the BCF should reflect what he actually is, which is a founding member of the BCF.
If this is somehow disappoint to you, I really have no reply.

So the only "problem" with the democratic vote is there is the potential to split the currency in two. Rather than a winner takes all scenario, you could end up with either two diluted currencies or the turmoil kills it.
That said, it seems unlikely XT's fork will get any kind of traction now and the economic majority + miners will go with a proposal from Bitcoin Core. Of course it's early days, time will tell, but he XT movement appears to me, to have peaked.

No, because eventual consistency implies a system where conflicts can occur and are resolved. Your analogy is is completely inappropriate. LN transactions are as good as, and as if they were written directly to the blockchain as is. The bitcoin blockchain itself is eventually consistent, but that's orthogonal to this discussion.
@_date: 2015-09-03 23:53:48
The law is pretty clear on that. The answer is, any unauthorised activity, and activity that harms a computer system or network is illegal. In order to improve a system you need permission, and that's going to be impossible on a decentralised system. 
It's what testnet is for I guess. Or partitioned simulations.

I am sorry, but as someone who actually follows and participates in the development process, and has reviewed a lot of pull requests (over two years), I can confidently say you're quite incorrect. No-one creates a shitstorm like Mike. No-one else creates so much discontent and makes the project unpleasant like Mike does. People might say Peter or Luke have controversial views at times, but they are not making development shitstorms nor making other contributors lives miserable... quite the opposite, they both contribute at lot to the project. We're not talking about simply having differing opinions here. Mike lies and twists using every trick in the book. It's almost as if he's doing it on purpose. No love lost here, Mike is toxic, plain and simple. I might be more willing to say this in public, but I can rest-assure you I'm far from alone in my views.

Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation. It is the most widely used distribution, and it is absolutely the most peer reviewed and well supported distribution. As such, it is likely to remain that way. The BIP process is very much like the IETF RFC system, some are adopted, some are not. No consensus changes are ever made without a BIP.

nullc thanks for your replies. FWIW I never implied or certainly never meant to if it was perceived as such, to suggest you are anything but an asset to the bitcoin core development team. Clearly you know your stuff and are one of the most experienced the field and I respect you considerably for your achievements. This has never been an issue for me, ever. I want to say this quite categorically if it's not clear. I also have nothing but awe for many of the other devs too, like sipa and wladamir and I appreciate how . They have always been very kind and generous.
I dont want to drag this out any more but there were a couple of things I would like to answer just for the record.


I never said there was misbehaviour, just concerns about what could be which I already voiced and you have given your answers.


I didnt attack your motivations. This is a misunderstanding: maybe I am not articulate enough or maybe something lost in translation: I asked a simple question about company influence and I think you have given a detailed reply. Thank you.


I do support bitcoin core development and several bitcoin and non-bitcoin projects: including code, peer review, testing, support, and funding. I don't feel compelled to spell it out in detail simply because I have nothing to prove by doing so: it's not relevant to be qualified to ask questions or not. 99% of people on r/bitcoin are not contributing anything either, they are just fans, like to discuss and maybe hold some coins. They all have a right to ask questions too.


This is not correct. Take a look at the repository. All credits are there in source, including in the binaries. I don't expect you have looked at the binaries but all the [credits are there too in the UI]( as a quick example.  I take licensing and attribution very seriously and I do not believe in NIH.


Sorry I may have missed this question before. I don't have exclusive control, it's an open source project. There are 4 people with commit access to viacoin and the other projects. Remember Github Teams are private by default for new participant and individuals needs to change their settings for each team specifically. That's why they dont show on the github.com/viacoin organisation screen.
so to round off, thank you for your replies. I am sorry this gave you an unpleasant Sunday but look at it positively, you have some material you can construct into a FAQ should someone else ask again.
For the record I am not convinced about some of the technical merits of the blockstream project other parts I find fascinating and I am open to new ideas and viewpoints. I would like to think if I ask questions about something else we can forgo any conspiracies about "conflicts of interests", in fact, this illustrates my point quite nicely. You have suggested because I have a "rival project" I cannot be asking questions without some ulterior motive. hold that thought and apply the same rationale as to why I asked about commercial conflicts of interest in core development. From my side I can say in good faith, viacoin isnt a conflict for me to question bitcoin governance. Your message today is you act in good faith that there wont be conflict between blockstream and bitcoin core development. If either one of those statements is acceptable, the other has to be. If either one is objectionable, then the other is also in question and this will always be in the eye of the beholder.
nullc, thank you again for taking the time to answer and I hope the way forward is full of roses and no thorns! :)

Good call, but sad it came true.
@_date: 2015-09-01 23:17:21
There's a good reason it stalled for years. Firstly, Bitcoin Core has only recently been optimised well enough not to make 1MB blocks a problem and secondly, more importantly, there has been no need for larger blocks, nor is there any immediate or near term need such that the sky will fall if we don't. Spamming the network does not count here, someone can always do that if sufficiently motivated. The only time we see anything remotely congested is when people "stress test". All of which is pointless because if there are say 400kb/block transactions under normal circumstances, adding a ton of spam makes no odd as the 400kb/block of transactions can just outbid the spam and basically all the genuine users are not affected.
And that's the point, we're being rushed again, by the same person when there is no immediate need. He claimed we needed p2sh immediately, yet 2+ years went by without it being used. Now Bitcoin will die. Same drama different setting.

This is a popular meme, perpetuated by Gavin's misleading blog post series. People are visualising sudden 10x increase transaction volume. That's just not how it works in the real world. There is time to scale up and random peaks are just noise, and easily dealt with paying a higher fee if it's really important.
The stress tests don't prove anything because they are noise. They do not replicate real behaviour. 
People have said the same thing in the past about the two week diff adjustments and spikes or lows in the hashrate, but in reality it doesnt matter.
I am avoiding entertaining any of the "panic trains of thought" I have seen enter the debate which are designed to appeal to the populist sensibilities but that do not match reality.

Wrong. Because LN or any payment channel is using bitcoin, it very much depends on bitcoin blockchain: because payment channels utilise normal bitcoin transaction. You're confusing the fact LN could be deployed with other cryptocurrencies, but in every case that implementation depends on the cryptocurrency it binds to. LN for Bitcoin, LN for Litecoin etc.

The failure of the Bitcoin Foundation has nothing to do with MtGox, but I think you missed the point entirely of having a "central body".

You are making assumptions about players and actors. Some people have that outlook yes but I can assure you not most or all. It's quite ridiculous for anyone to condone reckless behaviour. Even in anarchistic governance, bad behaviour is not tolerated. That you can make such crass statements shows you have absolutely no understanding of what you are talking about.
My message is very clear to attackers, you're on the wrong side of the law. Whether you get caught is another story, but if you do, there will be dire consequences and no bad nothing redditors are going to change that fact. The law is the law, like it or hate it; stupid or rational; moral or immoral; but in all cases, it's the law with sweeping powers to enact "violence" against people who break it.

I'm pretty confident they have already committed offences in the the UK, EU and United States because all have similar rules about deliberately causing unauthorised disruption to computer networks and systems. These attacks, apart from being a nuisance cause actual harm by crashing nodes, consuming memory/resources, and denying service. There's clear intent, it's clearly unauthorised because no-one agrees to let some attacker crash or deny service to their computer system and it's reckless.

Watch the interview with Gavin that was published yesterday by Epicenter. There are quite a few contradictions in the video footage regarding Gavin's worldview/perception/actions. On the one hand he's trying to portray himself as this happy go lucky, pragmatic, "nice guy". Yet he reveals, no, slips up, that much of his actions are premeditated. He's using certain narratives yet goes against them later. It would seem to me he knows exactly what he is doing, and trying (badly) to paint a different picture. Mike is much more adept in his approach than Gavin.

You're generalising and trying to apply it to this situation. I have explained, this debate is not as clear cut as you're trying to make out. The blocksize issue is just a convenient, and easily distorted and politicised issue to fuel an agenda.
With regard to your assertions about technical disagreements, I think something that is not widely understood is when you're talking about consensus systems, cryptography and privacy no proposal is ever a no-brainer. Everything is a tradeoff based on assumptions. It's further complicated because Bitcoin interacts on a socio-economic level such you have to take into account human behaviour. When people who are unfamiliar with these fields read these kinds of discussions it's very easy to see unreconcilable differences. However, this debate long ago left the realms of technical debate and became political.

So long as there isnt naked margin trading going on, margin trade has a smoothing effect. When the price trends up people go long. To profit they have to sell their coins and cover the position. That selling dampens rises. Likewise when the price looks to be trending down, people short. To take profit requires buying back sold coins to cover the position. That tends to dampen the selloffs. Over time this activity reduces activity. Of course, it requires exchanges with decent order depth, systems that work under load, and protocols that prevent cascading margin calls.
The Merkle audit is more or less useless because it does not in any way prove solvency. Unless you are aware of the totally assets and liabilities, you've no way of knowing if those coins are borrowed (or bought with borrowed funds), bought with your fiat reserves, etc etc. There's no way to cryptographically prove reserves in a meaningful way and frankly Merkle audits may give an extremely false sense of security.

I'm not accusing you of doing so, but I'm pointing out that the existence of a Chief Scientist position at all, and one filled by someone who is leading a schism fork, very much brings the Bitcoin Foundation into picture with bias. That's why I'm suggesting the title goes away.


I am not one of those, although I do question why the BCF exists at all given they no longer serve any roles: the don't lobby politically nor do they support bitcoin development as they once did. But let's not get sidetracked, my particular focus is not the Bitcoin Foundation itself.


I would like to see the role of Chief Scientist go away. I have no problems if you have a title Technical Advisor, but only if it's a role where the person filling it actually does something. This to me, is a no-brainer.

Here's another shocking Bitfinex fubar 
@_date: 2015-09-05 13:34:10
The problem as I see it with the title "Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation" is it is easily conflated and confused in the public's eye as "Chief Scientist of Bitcoin" and that is confusing. It promotes the idea there is an authority figure over Bitcoin which goes against the core message of decentralisation.
My real complaint is not that this role is filled by Gavin, it's that it exists at all. 
I am unfamiliar with the workings of the Bitcoin Foundation and if you actually need this position, but assuming you need a technical advisor, then surely it would be better named as "technical advisor" (specifically without chief). However, as far as I can ascertain, Gavin isnt actually doing anything for the BCF other than occupying name sake role.
As for recognition, I think this is orthogonal: Gavin will always have his history under his belt as someone who played a key role in Bitcoin's early days and that should be self standing. There are several others who played key roles back then too, equally as important as Gavin and they do just fine. The title "bitcoin developer" is really enough.
If I need to talk specifically about Gavin however, it really does not look good that he is advocating a schism as your "Chief Scientist" and I feel this very much does bring the Bitcoin Foundation unnecessarily into the politics of the matter while passively "taking sides".

Yeah, they are being pretty dishonest/misleading in their presentation. It's like a Chinese %0 fee exchange claiming they match 120,000BTC of trades per day. Well they do, but the number is meaningless since customers are using bots to make tons of trades endlessly back and forth (sort of HFT) at no cost.  BitFinex and Bitstamp, the top two USD exchanges have a few hundred thousand BTC controlled by BitGo wallets, think of all the money coming into and out of cold storage, etc.

Genuine traffic from legitimate sources (i.e. lots of people trying to see a web page at once because it was published on a popular new site and the site falling over because it's not powerful enough), is quite different to one individual, with intention to cause disruption sending tons of bogus traffic. The fact a website can be overrun with traffic is totally besides the point.

The problem is even if the government makes legislation saying bitcoin is ok, the banks dont have to accept bitcoin customers. Think of it like lending - banks set their own lending policies so regardless of the government of the day, the banks control the flow of new money into the economy. That's why the British Gov needed to literally bribe the banks to start lending mortgages again with that stupid "Home to Buy" ponzi scheme where the government literally stumps up around 35% of the deposit so borrowers can actually afford to pay the remaining 5% deposit required.
Unless banks are literally compelled to accept bitcoin business, dont hold up much hope.

There is a process, he just doesn't want to accept it because it is not a process he agrees with. It also helps his narrative to distort the picture to justify his actions. Sorry, but as someone who participates in Core I can assure you there is a process. It has its quirks for sure, but there is a process. Mike just doesn't like that process, nor does he like the fact that process has rejected several of his pull requests... so his ploy is to claim systemic failure to push his own narrative.

It does not, because Coinkite is processing transactions as a merchant processor and consumer wallet. Bitgo is processing wallets, with two of the largest bitcoin exchanges, which we can be sure account for most of this "volume". Coinkite's numbers are much more meaningful than BitGo's.
BitGo are clearly trying to pimp their company using misleading representation of their volume (misleading in terms of the meaning) so they can inflate their perceived value (for a future IPO?).

The ability to make nodes keel over is certainly not "intended". It's a weakness in the current implementation. When people are playing fairly, and actually using bitcoin as "intended", nodes do not keel over. The usage of bitcoin hasn't come anywhere near the danger scanarios painted by these attacks, nor are the attacks a reasonable simulation of a busy network. Even the transaction footprints are different to normal use.

Which is meaningless without a simultaneous fiat audit which cannot be done cryptographically, and generally meaningless because it doesn't prevent shenanigans like borrowing BTC temporarily to make everything balance.

That's not how it works. If you have intent to cause disruption, and with that intent you cause (unauthorised) disruption, you have committed an offence. It's matters not that Bitcoin is vulnerable. You have deliberately exploited it's weakness to cause harm. In the eyes of the law, that's enough. Look at case history, people are successfully prosecuted for a lot less. Heck, even accessing an unpassword protected computer is an offence. Dont confuse ability to access (due to weaknesses, or lack of passwords) with permission.

It's not bitcoin "compatible", it *is* bitcoin. They are called "payment channels". Think of them as a caching layer for Bitcoin, or even compression.

I appreciate your position regarding the BCF. I don't think you can presume my request does or doesn't have support as I'm only voicing it now.
The BCF unfortunately is not representative of the bitcoin community and there's no way to disprove commercial sponsor interests at the BCF. In any case the BCF does not remotely represent even a cross section sampling of the bitcoin community and is widely decried as defunct and failed organisation. So it's a rather unfortunate situation where members wishes *could* be divorced from the bitcoin community, and the best interests of Bitcoin as a whole. I'm not saying this is the case, but asking people to join the BCF to enact a change is unworkable.
If the BCF is truly trying to remain unbiased regarding blocksize, then like it or not, Gavin, by championing a schism fork against the technical community, has dragged the BCF into the debate with bias. Remember he does so as Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation. Look at all the TV and news presentations where Gavin champions his point of view, it's as Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Fondation. There's no way to separate yourselves from that even with some fine print disclaimer on the website.

No you dont have to show damages. Unauthorised attacks are illegal under these laws, plain and simple. In fact, it's enough to even try (but fail). The stress tests cause nodes to crash. That's enough.
Likewise, the UDP attacks against some bitcoin nodes would similarly be illegal, but they are a lot harder to pin on someone. In the case of coinwallet.eu, they've performed these attacks already, an announced more. It really wouldn't be difficult to prove intent.

While I am not accusing Bitfinex of doing it, this is a common pattern with distressed exchanges, they pick on people who they think are unwilling or unable to pass (enhanced) KYC so they can effectively confiscate their coins. it's an effective bail-in strategy.

There is no vendetta. Mike and Gavin both have been behaving badly for a long time, long before this blocksize business and unlike the others, I am willing to speak publicly about it and have done on several occasions. Mike is a lot more skilled than Gavin, but I see through their veneer.
Mike and Gavin absolutely know better but they instead chose to misrepresent, and make and introduce bad proposals and introduce weak and badly written code. 
Furthermore, Gavin is currently hiding behind his title as Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, a title which the BCF seems unwilling to take back, even though they dont pay him and he doesn't work for them as CS. This further bolsters his public credibility for people who are new or dont know better.

@_date: 2015-11-10 18:52:50


It may also be of interest how Viacoin fits into this picture. Firstly, since Viacoin is based on Bitcoin Core it is a downstream project from Bitcoin Core. That means, anything that goes into Bitcoin may also end up in Viacoin. The fact remains that Bitcoin Core is the most active project with the most expertise and peer review in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Overall, my goal with Viacoin was to contribute positively to the ecosystem and that even if my project was not successful, that it would have a legacy that was useful for the world at large. The invention of bitcoin is an incredibly important invention for humanity and I want to see the technology develop and succeed.
This being the case, Peter and I agreed that it makes no sense to develop features in a vacuum because this stuff is hard and takes a long time to mature. Even if the target was for Viacoin (and in the example of CLTV, it was first deployed in Viacoin in January 2015), it makes sense that the BIPs and development work go on upstream with the aim of filtering back down. This ensures several criterion are met: that work is well peer reviewed and where possible contributions end up in Bitcoin Core and benefit everyone. If something is included in Bitcoin it must have been considered a good thing and is well peer reviewed and tested. Viacoin will benefit downstream: but the reverse is not true, something developed exclusively for Viacoin will never have the same level of quality.
All things being equal, if the feature/fix is merged to Bitcoin Core, that's a win for the Bitcoin ecosystem and for Viacoin which will get the feature downstream. If the feature is considered a bad idea as revealed by peer review, it stops a bad idea. If the idea is good but too radical for Bitcoin (which is hard to change because of it's size due to risks, or osification), then Viacoin is still at liberty to make the feature itself because Viacoin is much smaller. There almost no ossification and a lot less risks.
Peter is his own man, guided by his own lights. To be clear his principals about Bitcoin override everything. So I let him get on with Bitcoin Core work he wanted but didnt necessarily have time to do without being paid since paid consulting takes priority. I say this because it's not possible to have a conflict of interest with Peter involved, he will never do something he doesn't believe in and want to do in the first place.
I would like to comment about "number of commits". It may not be apparent to readers who are not directly involved in Bitcoin development, but writing code may actually be the least time consuming part of development. The amount of time required to even tests a patch cannot be underestimated. It can take a long time to get things right, and it may take a long time for reviewers to find problems. Unlike most other projects, it is incredible easy to introduce consensus bugs or introduce attack vectors with incredible consequences. Consensus systems really are difficult and code review, testing and security reviews are extremely time consuming. Even when one writes a patch, especially consensus or policy code it is very time consuming to do all the ancillary work of writing BIPs, discussion and championing the pull request and competing for reviewers (yes, literally there is competition to get stuff reviewed because there are so many patches and things going on).
Since all this blocksize debacle, I have also become very involved in Bitcoin Core helping where I can especially in the area of scalability, code review and testing. I can vouch it is entirely possible to spend weeks on end with very little material to show. It's just the nature of the work.
So whether you like or hate Viacoin, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY for example, was materialsed because of it. That is to say, without paying Peter it is very unlikely the necessary work would have done the work on materialising CLTV and it would not have been deployed in Bitcoin today. I take no credit for CLTV, it is an invention of Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell, but I did provide the oil to make it happen. CLTV was deployed (enforced) in Viacoin in January 2015 and we're about to begin deployment in Bitcoin Core. CLTV is widely anticipated by service provider developers (wallets, micropayment channels, lightning network), and I've affectionally nicknamed it OP_HODL. RBF is another big contribution which has seen several iterations. That means a lot of code, and as yet still unmerged, although it seems likely this will be added soon.
Overall, Peter is an incredibly valuable asset to the Bitcoin community. There are very few people with the kind of deep understanding and attention to detail. It has been a privilege working with him.

versionbits (BIP9) will be a way of rolling out softforks in parallel. Because this code wasnt completed in time, we chose to use the IsSuperMajority() method (ISM for short). The same method that was used to roll out BIP66.
If the current and maybe even a future ISM softfork does not complete before we start a versionbits softfork, the ISM rollout wont interfere BIP9.

Basically they allow one to create smart contracts that obet absolute and relative locktime. Absolute means cant spend until a fix date/time in the future. Relative means relative to when the transaction is included in the block, e.g. 1 day after inclusion in a block.
CLTV = OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (for absolute lock-time)
CSV = OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (for relative lock-time)
Because bitcoins can be encumbered with these constraints, it allows one to prove funds have been committed. Once committed, they cannot be malleated. the initial commitment TX of course could be malleated until it is confirmed, which is no biggie.
You can read a lot more about CSV here replete with LN example use-cases:

Currently XT nodes will relay the first double spend, and with 8% of nodes, that means it's now easier to relay double spends across the network, although even with it, it's still trivial to double spend. There are also quite a few RBF nodes on the network which have been active for a year or so.

It's a false battle to say it's bigger blocks against status quo.
And absolutely no, Coinbase has no greater say in this than the next man or woman. It really doesnt matter that Coinbase has NASDAQ funding or 2 million wallets or whatever, that is not leverage. Bitcoin is defined by those who chose to mine and those who chose to run a full node. 
It's very egalitarian in this respect. The only are where economic majority really matters is in the markets, because bitcoin market cap is so small and the markets so illiquid, people with access to large funds in either BTC or fiat can (and do) push the markets about for their short term gain.
Regarding your comments about miners: you have this quite backwards, and you should read what miners have actually said. They support an increase by technical majority consensus. They are not, nor can they, impose their will on the network. Blocksize is a hard fork and it is only by majority agreement that a change can happen smoothly.
With regard to Adam, I'm not entirely sure what you are referring to, but the game theory is that if exchanges who are the fiat gateway were to chose XT, then they could force miners to switch because if miners want to get paid, they'd have to switch. This argument is false because the ensuing tug of war would be devastating to the market and not be in the best interests of exchanges (whose fees are related to the price of BTC).
Noone, not even Coinbase is going to engage in a tug of war that would devastate the bitcoin price and confidence in the markets. So all of this is just a political tug of war and a battle of wits. 
The path forward is whatever is in the interests of Bitcoin, which is means keeping the security properties of bitcoin. If those change, then bitcoin becomes uninteresting and subject to regulatory capture. Whatever solutions we arrive at for scalability must preserve these qualities or bitcoin will simply become an elephant.

You're completely off base. Prior to the moderation policy the list had been overrun with people running a muck with socially unacceptable behaviour, personal attacks, disruptive and outright irrelevant posting. Developers do not want to wade through that or be forced to  just to satisfy your conspiratorial mindset.
Developers need to communicate and discuss technical issues and discuss proposals and that's not possible in the middle of a riot. It's as simple as that. We are not censoring anything, we are moderating. If a post is not within the moderation guidelines the post is forwarded to the moderation list, the poster is notified of the reason and is given the opportunity to appeal. In some cases the post is more suited to bitcoin-discuss so we ask them to repost there. 
Moderation sends a clear message to agitators not to bother and provides a safe environment for us to get back to work. Moderation makes development much more open because conversations don't have to be taken off list.

You're making a statement based on what sounds reasonable to you. The United States is not a reasonable country when it comes to laws. It's legal for cops to rob you on the highway (civil asset forfeiture). People get jailed for non-violent crimes for life, children are jailed for life without possibility of parole. People spend months in jail because they cant afford $500 bail for a minor offence and have to wait months for their trial date and as a result many people plea guilty to crimes they did not commit so they can get out of bail-jail.
The DoJ absolutely uses every dirty trick in the book to get high conviction rates, including slapping on a ton of trumped up charges that could get you decades in jail, forcing you to take a plea bargain - a system which deprives people the right to a fair trial.
So yes, the United States does, knowingly and willingly deprive people of funds so they are unable to defend themselves and they can get a conviction. The US justice system has degenerated into a disaster.

I don't believe Bitcoin will be the only cryptocurrency moving into the future. I cant think of a single example where one product has completely dominated a market and I wouldnt underestimate the ability of established big players to bring a new payment system to market and vastly overtake Bitcoin's network effects. In short, I think even when two products are basically identical, separated by "branding", that in and of itself is enough. The market likes choice. We all like icecream, but I prefer Hagen Das, you prefer Ben and Jerry's sort of thing. I do agree it is very hard to bring a new product to market and succeed, there a lot to do with marketing, budget and right timing.
The proposals that bypass the politics of choosing a number are called "flexicap" or "elastic blocksize". There is one by gmaxwell which I dont think has a number, which allows miners to create any blocksize above the "cap" by spending a little more difficulty target. Meni Rosenfeld proposed something similar where miners pay a penalty to future miner. is also working on some variations.
Regarding Coinbase etc. I dont think any company needs to collude - the point is successful companies will naturally take away tx volume. Take Paypal for example, they gained so many customers they formed their own ecosystem and tx volume away from credit cards. Of course, they also drive transaction volume through credit cards but the paypal to paypal ecosystem takes a lot of load off that. Paypal became successful because they innovated a useful and easy product. Where Bitcoin falls down is the difficult of use. Even getting bitcoins is a chore: Coinbase solve this rather nicely by providing both a wallet and a way to buy and sell coins. Their customer retention must be quite good. It only takes a few companies like this to grow through good marketing to take away a significant chunk of volume from the blockchain. Of course they will drive some traffic to the blockchain, but as they grow bigger it will become a closed loop like paypal.
So the issue of fees is really down to what is practical. As it stands, bitcoin runs on subsidy (25BTC*144blocks=3600BTC/day). As subsidy goes down who will pay for network security. It's an open question. All I am positing is that the assumption that tx volume will grow to fill the gap is not one that may play out and there is much reason to believe, in my mind, it will not (and I find this very worrying).
Flexicap proposals do at least have the property of scaling blocksize as necessary without driving fees to zero which cant happen anyway because fees serve as an anti-spam measure. If there is a ton of space in blocks and fees are low, the cost of flooding the network remains small. If the available space is reasonably scarce, if someone floods the network with cheap fee txs, genuine users will be able to bump their fees and drive the spammer out of the market. Fees too should and are flexible if you have an environment that allows them to be (meaning with elastic blocksize).

For the blocksubsidy to be replaced by fees will require either price of BTC to go up dramatically, number of transactions to go up dramatically or fees to rise. Probably a combination of all of these. It is not a good assumption that price will rise, it may not, or may not rise significantly enough. There is also no guarantee the number of transactions will go up significantly either. Increasing the blocksize significantly on the assumption both tx volume and price will rise significantly is simply a guessing game. There are all sort of reasons why transaction volume may not increase dramatically even without LN - The Coinbase/Paypal model is a good reason. They could take, and maybe do take millions of transactions of the blockchain already and there's nothing we can do about that. So it's quite possible bitcoin adoption increases a lot but does not affect the chain in the ways the "crash landing" model assumes.
Ever increasing transaction volume is an unrealistic assumption that simply never plays out that way and assumes no competition in the space. There absolutely will be competition, like it or not. For example, something like Zerocash has the potential to devastate Bitcoin's use as p2p cash. Sidechains technology exists so there will be vendors providing solutions. Micropayment system exist already and with opcodes like OP_HODL means people will build out even more solutions and this will reduce on chain tx volume. Services like Coinbase will continue to be launched and expand, and they will consume onchain volume. Therefore, it is unrealistic to assume ever increasing transaction volume.
In any case, if the blocksize is increased too much it will have the effect of driving fees down, remembering that there's a percentage of space in each block for free transactions too, which will increase with the block. Overzealous size increase will be detrimental to the long term incentives of Bitcoin mining.
What is necessary is for blocksize to be elastic in such a way as not to hurt the fee market yet not exert too much pressure. This way the blockcap can go away entirely and sidestep the politics of choosing a number, which is never going to satisfy everyone's own opinions.

We would all love to see bitcoin grow, but Bitcoin is not a dumping ground for random data. There are other ways to leverage the blockchain to imprint data without causing huge bloat and any company that is thinking about directly storing their whatever on the blockchain clearly does not understand the technology.
The immutable proof of publication aspect of the blockchain can be leveraged to prevent the tampering of unlimited amounts of data offchain. The effect is exactly the same, with tamper-resistance. One such solution for example is to create a merkle tree of each record and store the root in the blockchain. This way you could have millions of records timestamped and tamperproof on the blockchain with one transaction.
Sorry, but VCs saying "I want to do" is not justification in and of itself to ruin the properties of bitcoin.

Chinese pools and exchanges have resoundly rejected both the idea of BIP101, running XT or moving ahead with wide technical consensus, I think Coinbase and Bitstamp et al will have a rather difficult time forcing their will upon the protocol. Running XT is fine if they feel that way they should have upgraded a long time ago with the other 400 nodes that are online, what is the big deal? Clearly there is some attempt to strongarm evreyone  to going with their minority views. That's not particularly healthy for bitcoin as a whole but I think the protocol is robust against this, and if it's not, it will be very concerning that a few players could force Bitcoin to change to their whim.
In any case ,until and unless the majority of nodes upgrade and miners go along with it BIP101 is certain to remain unactivated.
FWIW, BIP65 is exactly what uncontroversial consensus of the entire community looks like and this is what blocksize increase will have to be like too or nothing will happen.

To answer your question, there was a suggestion to burn coins that were double spent. the problem is anyone can "double spend" any transaction by jiggering with an already valid signature on an existing TX thus making a new tx. It means 3rd parties could just go round malleating (sic) transactions for fun causing havok. 
What I dont like about mike_herns article is the assumption that RBF is a "bad idea" that can be stopped - miners are free to add the patch and this is just a political issue and one miners could merge just for the economic benefits. There is already a service that offers easy double spending  
Put it another way, remember address reuse issues? Address reuse came about because it was easy given the tech at the time to just publish an address on website or printed media (there were no things like stealth addresses for examples). So it became something people grew to rely on. Yet Satoshi never meant for addresses to be reused, it was and always has been actively discouraged.
Acceptance of so called "unconfirmed" transactions came about because well, at the time, if a TX was seen on the network, it was most likely to confirm, and it's just easy. There werent the tools to easily undo a transaction unless you were super techy.
In both cases, the community adopted bad practices just because they could. Address reuse is a really bad idea, accepting unconfirmed transactions is an even worse idea. Whether RBF as standard is the solution, I dont know, but there is no way to stop people implementing RBF and all it takes is 5-10% of the hashing power to make unconfirmed transactions a significant problem on top of the already easy lottery of using things like bitundo.

Both will have to happen, but the extent to which blocks have to increase in size is very much in question. Bitcoin must be able to scale without compromising  the security model or decentralisation aspect. In any case, even massive blocks are definitely not a long term solution and layer 2 solutions are absolutely necessary.

Another classic way the Western governments bully citizens: "you're free not to give us your password, but if you dont, we'll steal your stuff".
In the UK they can invoke RIPA and threaten you with up to I think 5 or 10 years in jail for not disclosing an encryption password!!!
A the solution, although a but cumbersome, is to keep sensitive files encrypted on a cloud service somewhere, something like Spider Oak. If you keep an encrypted container like a Truecrypt container, it is easy to download once you have cleared the boarders. Same for your mobile phone/tablet. Perform a backup and wipe before travelling, restore on entry.

Quoting from email to the developer mailing list 
**tl;dr Cost savings by using replace-by-fee, 30-90%**
CPFP is a significantly more expensive way of paying fees than RBF,
particularly for the use-case of defragmenting outputs, with cost
savings ranging from 30% to 90%
Case 1: CPFP vs. RBF for increasing the fee on a single tx
Creating an spending a P2PKH output uses 34 bytes of txout, and 148
bytes of txin, 182 bytes total.
Let's suppose I have a 1 BTC P2PKH output and I want to pay 0.1 BTC to
Alice. This results in a 1in/2out transaction t1 that's 226 bytes in size.
I forget to click on the "priority fee" option, so it goes out with the
minimum fee of 2.26uBTC. Whoops! I use CPFP to spend that output,
creating a new transaction t2 that's 192 bytes in size. I want to pay
1mBTC/KB for a fast confirmation, so I'm now paying 418uBTC of
transaction fees.
On the other hand, had I use RBF, my wallet would have simply
rebroadcast t1 with the change address decreased. The rules require you
to pay 2.26uBTC for the bandwidth consumed broadcasting it, plus the new
fee level, or 218uBTC of fees in total.
Cost savings: 48%
Case 2: Paying multiple recipients in succession
Suppose that after I pay Alice, I also decide to pay Bob for his hard
work demonstrating cryptographic protocols. I need to create a new
transaction t2 spending t1's change address. Normally t2 would be
another 226 bytes in size, resulting in 226uBTC additional fees.
With RBF on the other hand I can simply double-spend t1 with a
transaction paying both Alice and Bob. This new transaction is 260 bytes
in size. I have to pay 2.6uBTC additional fees to pay for the bandwidth
consumed broadcasting it, resulting in an additional 36uBTC of fees.
Cost savings: 84%
Case 3: Paying multiple recipients from a 2-of-3 multisig wallet
The above situation gets even worse with multisig. t1 in the multisig
case is 367 bytes; t2 another 367 bytes, costing an additional 367uBTC
in fees. With RBF we rewrite t1 with an additional output, resulting in
a 399 byte transaction, with just 36uBTC in additional fees.
Cost savings: 90%
Case 4: Dust defragmentation
My wallet has a two transaction outputs that it wants to combine into
one for the purpose of UTXO defragmentation. It broadcasts transaction
t1 with two inputs and one output, size 340 bytes, paying zero fees.
Prior to the transaction confirming I find I need to spend those funds
for a priority transaction at the 1mBTC/KB fee level. This transaction,
t2a, has one input and two outputs, 226 bytes in size. However it needs
to pay fees for both transactions at once, resulting in a combined total
fee of 556uBTC. If this situation happens frequently, defragmenting
UTXOs is likely to cost more in additional fees than it saves.
With RBF I'd simply doublespend t1 with a 2-in-2-out transaction 374
bytes in size, paying 374uBTC. Even better, if one of the two inputs is
sufficiently large to cover my costs I can doublespend t1 with a
1-in-2-out tx just 226 bytes in size, paying 226uBTC.
Cost savings: 32% to 59%, or even infinite if defragmentation w/o RBF
              costs you more than you save

There is no gap to fill. The entire premise that the sky is falling is *completely wrong*. However, bitcoin fundamentally does not scale on layer 1.


You're looking at the game from one side failing to see it would be a MAD play and thus, it is not in the "economic majority's" best interests to try and make that play. In any case, the entire play is based on assumptions of who and what the economic majority are and that they are static and participants fixed.


Then I suggest you actually take time to understand the complex tradeoff and scalability issues of bitcoin because they are not simple and changing one parameter is not a panacea. You are simply handwaving away the complexities in order to make your case.

Your comments about Chinese exchanges are off-base: they openly operate 0% fees which (which will result in the huge volume because there is no cost for customers to run high activity bots). Chinese people demand 0% fees. BTCChina tried to introduce fees in 2014 and everyone left, forcing them to go back to 0% to remain in business. When making comparisons about exchanges, and volume it's very important to compare apples to apples.
I would also point out that Coinbase and itBit launched with 0% fess, which also resulted in large opening volumes. itBit's 0% fees run until the end of the month... and we have to trust these exchanges are offering preferential fee rates to VIP customers.

I find this highly suspect. Maybe they are counting their change outputs? For example I send 1BTC using an output of 100BTC could be counted as 100BTC transacted (1BTC + 99BTC change), rather than the reality of 1BTC. Do that a bunch of times, specially with Bitstamp and Bitfinex (their biggest customers), and I imagine you'd get up to "$1bn" pretty fast.

Personally speaking, I think we have to stop trying to get Bitcoin to fit all scenarios where centralized services *are* better. There is also a happy medium for 3rd party business like greenaddress.it which allows instant payment with partner merchants.
It works like this:
1. You send funds to greenaddress.it wallet (it's 2-2 multisig). They immediately send you a refund nlocktime so if their service goes down, or they lose their keys, you can always get your funds back.
2. When you sign a tx, they countersign it. So this means that from greenaddress's point of view, once you sign a TX, they can guarantee the tx will be confirmed because they provide the second signature. You cannot double spend the TX because they wont be signing the double spend.
This means they can offer an instant payment API where a merchant can find out from greenaddress.it if they payment came from them. Sure it's a trusted model, but it's one that is very bitcoinesk because you still are not trusting 3rd parties with your money.
With respect to the "expecting the worst" I like to think about altcoin security. Most altcoins adopt security models that absolutely *can* be attacked (low hash rates being the most common vector). However it's extremely uncommon for alts to be attacked. This doesnt mean they cant be, or wont be in the future. It just means someone hasnt gotten around it it yet, or doesnt have the incentive which could be monetary (rational), or could be vengeful (irrational).
0-confirms are a bit like that. There just arent the tools nor is bitcoin widespread enough as a payment system for it to become a problem (yet). It will become a problem and RBF will become something a decent amount of the hashing power will eventually adopt because there is financial incentive to do so (mining the higher fees).
Mike used to work for Google and takes his experience of how they dealt with spam as being something that will apply to bitcoin. Basically he said the solutions they adopted we not the most robust according to theory of what could happen, but they worked anyway. The problem is there arent the same incentives when comparing the two systems (email vs bitcoin).
Double spending already happens at a level no-one wants to readily admit and 0-confirms are generally not accepted for tangible goods by anyone experienced. The mailorder examples quoted about bitpay/coinbase are false because while merchants appear to be accepting 0conf, they are infact not shipping goods until there are lots of confirmations (even though this is unintentional,just normal fulfilment delays). I am pretty sure bitpay/coinbase would notify merchants if a TX did not confirm. I am not a merchant so I cant try out a double spend myself to see what happens backend.
In any case, I believe Mike's article to just be another example of his clever political handwaving which will eventually be proven wrong only after many more people get shafted.

It's not that it's not legitimate: of course people are still trading and the volume reflects the trades. What you cannot do however is compare the volume of fee and non-fee exchanges because it sets up a completely different trading dynamic.
Think of it like this: With fees, when you have fees you are basically down the moment you open a trade because you just paid a fee, and will also have to pay a fee to close your position (assuming you a taker). This means your opportunities to scalp are quite different, the market needs to move more to break-even. With 0 fee, you can move in an out with no extra spread created by fees. This means you can scalp trade a lot (lots of small trades with very little risk - perfect to automate with bots for example. 
Both trading strategies are quite legitimate, but scalp trading is more risky on a fee based exchange (which is why the Chinese exchanges are full of bots). Bots aside, 0 fees mean if a position goes bad, you can bail much more easily at the same price you bought in at.
Then there is the issue of wash trading: with no fees you can wash trade without any cost (filling your own orders using a separate account). Of course, wash trading is against Coinbase's published ethos, and in fact they prevent self eating orders in the same account, but it doesnt mean you cant do it (using separate accounts). "market makers" often work in groups anyway.
tldr; you have to compare apples to apples. When Coinbase's promo period ends and assuming everyone then pays the same fee structure, we will be able to compare Coinbase's volume with the USD exchanges (all of which have fees).

I think most people would agree this is ridiculous or somehow say "oh it's different because they are trading CNY" or the good old "fake volume" argument - which is exactly the point: 0% fee structures encourage traders to increase their volume because there is no cost to do so. That is why for an apples to apples comparison, you cannot include 0% fee exchanges or exchanges with promotional periods in the mix. We will only know Coinbase's true volume after their promotional period ends.

Please stop posting this rubbish. Coinbase is not number 3. They have zero fees for now. If you want to compare against 0 fees you have to account for chinese 0 fee exchanges too. Fee free exchanges always have inflated volume because of bot activity and the reduced spread.

I think you need to make distinctions between OKCoin.cn and OKcoin.com: most people reading this are not aware you operate two separate exchanges with different rules and fees.

I suggest you either sell them to maintain your current USD value, or keep the coins but open a short to hedge your USD value because you're not going to like the next 6 months of bitcoin price action...

I was quite surprised at Ross Gerber: he seriously understand the problem with the existing financial system and loathes it. He also sees the various hurdles and hate bitcoin will face. It's all to easy to think from his twitter posts that he's been anti bitcoin, but I think he's quite pro-bitcoin, but doesnt yet grasp how bitcoin could become a big thing^tm although he does see the potential he is realistic about the obstacles. 
It was great to engage with someone like this because he is open minded and frank. He's also an influencer so the more people like him understand bitcoin, the better it will be for general awareness.
For me the biggest takeaway was to see bitcoin from his perspective as someone used to the incumbent system and very much bound by it's rules and "assurances" (he's an investment fund manager).

No, Bitstamp has been losing business to Bitfinex and OKCoin.com for months . I am sure Coinbase has gotten some of their volume too now, but Bitstamp was already on their way down (since mid-2014) and regularly at least 3rd place. Their 0% fee promo gave them a quick boost before returning to oblivion.

Funny how you guys complain when it is China doing this stuff. Coinbase volume will drop after the fees are introduced. Same happened with bitstamp recently. 
No fees mean there is no extra spread when opening a trade so gives more trade opportunities with less risk, ie more volume. On the bad side it allows wash trading between separate accounts (making their anti wash trade policy and self order protection meaningless). Thirdly is provides a furtive ground for scalp bots. All of this extra opportunity goes away once there is a cost associated.

Actually yes, you can map the release of XT [to the chart]( and it's clear it caused a ~50% selloff. The subsequent failure of XT to garner just over 0% miner support has also been confidence building that there wont be a controversial split in the network.

In my opinion, 2015 is not going to be a good year for price, and we'll see $130s and lower. Furthermore, holding BTC in a bear market with the USD soaring is just crazy. It's simple fractions: USD up, BTC down. The best trade anyone could have made at $1100 was to just sell and do nothing - even if your long term goal was to buy more BTC, people have been calling the bottom *all the way down* for the last 15 months. It's not over yet and there will be plenty time to get in at a good price whenever the tide changes.
r/bitcoin is the same place that has been encouraging people to hodl all the way down since we peaked at $1100 remember... 
Dont get me wrong, I'm a permabull on bitcoin, love the tech, but right now is a completely barmy time to be holding a deprecating asset and there is a lot of selling pressure still to overcome (94k more SR coins to be sold, 26k more in AUS, 200k coins may have to be sold from MtGox, and even if they are just redistributed, you can be sure a lot of people will be cutting their losses). 
Remember, Bitcoin is not an investment, it's a speculative asset. A house can earn you rent, shares can earn you dividends. The only thing Bitcoin can offer price wise is the hope that someone will be willing to pay more for it than you did. That might be worth the gamble long term, but it's still a gamble and if you really want to accumulate more coins, just be patient, the price is going lower. 
You might be amused the last time [I gave caution]( the price dropped to $166 shortly after...
Block halving in 2016 might be just the ticket for some crazy price gains...

Seems pretty clear he's referring altering the existing paper as opposed to writing his own paper citing the old paper one which would be the normal convention. I disagree with altering the original paper.
I do not see anything in the OP that says "write a new updated paper citing the old paper and sources to corroborate the updated understanding".

If an exchange run 0% fees then it opens up a whole different pattern of trading. Look at OKCoin.cn (0% fee) vs OKCoin.com (maker/taker fees) for example. When there are no fees you can run bots scalping even $0.01 moves. If you have fees, then the moment you go into a trade you have a spread to cover. This adjusts trading behaviour. You can see what happened with Bitstamp during their 0% fee promotion as opposed to what happened afterwards as a clear example of this. Coinbase trade volume will reduce once they have fees (assuming they don't offer "market makers" 0% deals on the sly).

It isn't being discussed yet. It will come up at a weekly IRC meeting when the time is right. There is still a bit of fine tuning to do with segwit + compact block relay. I understand everyone is anxious to move forward with segwit, but it really takes as long as it takes I am afraid. Developers will never sign off on something they don't personally think is ready for deployment.
We're working on 0.13.0 release cycle at the moment, so in any case, it is unlikely to be before that is released since the general expectation is to release the segwit soft fork in 0.13.1.
Unfortunately, while the Bitcoin Core project does work to release schedules, it is not possible to guarantee which features will make it into a given release because that depends entirely on their readiness. If they miss the deadline, they are deferred to the next major release cycle. With soft forks the policy is to release in maintenance versions so the potential delay is less as maintenance releases are made on a more frequent basis.

I don't disagree, you should never change a whitepaper, but that is not what Cobra is saying. He said it should be updated. There are hundreds of links to bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf, so if that file is updated people will link to an altered version of the paper. You and p1bx are mind reading, I am replying to exactly what cobra wrote.
