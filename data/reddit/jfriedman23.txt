Hmm.  When I try to sign in to gdax it (the browser) quickly goes through an oauth redirect or something, but then it brings me to a page to upload my ID.  However, I am able to skip that for now and it lets me in.  I don't yet know if functionality will be decreased (since they don't have my ID) but I guess I'll find out...

Thank you.  Is Exodus good to use?  I thought I saw a bunch of comments on reddit regarding reasons not to use Exodus.

Ah, yeah, it says:  RESTRICTED ACCESS
Deposits and order placement are disabled on your account.  I have to upload my ID to fix this.

Is exodus safe?  Gets great reviews, but a lot of people also talking about it being closed source and possibly not safe.

Thank you.  to confirm though, I need to install different software on my computer for each one ( but each one works in conjunction with the one ledger s?  i'd prefer one piece of software (i.e. so I can look in one place and see my total value).  It wouldn't work this way correct?  Otherwise I've heard great things about ledger and was leaning in that direction.

I'm guessing not.  Is it safe to upload my ID?  I really don't like the idea of doing that...

Thanks!  I read that GDAX maybe uses same login as coinbase.  Is this correct, or do I need to open a new GDAX account and send them my ID?

I don't see ripple on exodus.  Am I just not noticing it or is it not there?
