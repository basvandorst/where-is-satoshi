They all seem objectionable. I could either send it to them and risk losing it, or send it to someone else and still risk losing it. As far as I'm concerned the reason merchants like BitCoin is because it allows them to sell their product and keep it too.

It wasn't a BitPay error, but an e-mail confirmation error. Where I sent the wrong amount it was the company's in-house payment system.
It's been 36 hours, and I still don't have money back in either case.

I did send a message to BitPay, but they didn't reply. Private Internet Access knew they had been paid, they were just being dicks about sending the confirmation e-mail. They claimed they needed proof that I was the same person who opened the account before they could send a confirmation e-mail to the same e-mail address they claimed to have already sent it.

Their human support personell were to slow at responding to tickets. Their server could only automatically respond to additional payments.

If you handle payments by having a deposit account where I have a "balance", and I deposit $19.75 (for whatever reason), I expect to either:
1. Have a balance of $19.75.
2. Have the opportunity to send a second payment for the remaining $0.25. This should be built-in functionality that doesn't require me to open a ticket.
3.  or I expect $19.75 to be returned to my original account (again, automatically, without human intervention).
What your system is programmed to do is keep the $19.75 and credit $0 to my balance.


This should of been in your logs, attached to my username. Your support person should of been able to look it up by typing my username. It's not my fault if you hired your 12-year-old nephew to code your site. EDIT: Also, your system should be sophisticated enough to allow support techs to refund bad transactions without giving them enough access to steal anything.


You were too slow. I made the OP based on what was in my inbox at the time: Nothing.

Incognito mode. I had already closed the browser after BitPay reported that the pament was successful.

I'm glad to hear you've had better luck with PIA. All they did for me was steal my money.

The bitcoins I sent didn't get lost. They're sitting in those providers' wallets, adding to their bottom line.

I imagine it would be even worse if you mailed them cash.
