So the ongoing supply of energy serves securing the proof of supplied energy in the past.

I fail to see the connection between supplying energy to bitcoin miners and humanity's overall standard of living.
1. Convert Natural Resources To Bitcoins
2. ???
3. Increase Humanity's overall standard of living
If you could fill in Numer 2 for me, I'd highly appreciate that ^.^

What's silly?

Yeah, kinda. Owning currency is a proof-of-debt. If you own government-backed currency, people (the government) are in your debt.


No. If you own Bitcoin, all you have is a proof-of-burned-natural-resources. Nobody owes you anything.

Don't think so. Lights and Computers are useful IMHO. Light helps us see and computers help us do things.
I'd like to exclude bankers though. Bankers are useless idiots.

Only if we agree that bitcoins themselves are useful.

But isn't it the case that throwing more resources at mining will result in more coins?
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:15:43


Well, this only means that the ABSOLUTE amount of bitcoins will not increase, but the person who burns the most resources will also mine the most coins RELATIVE to other miners. So it's simply a race to burning lots and lots of energy.

How is it scarce with an unlimited amounts of forks?

No that energy is not wasted. It has been converted into something that is useful. You don't use the existence of the bank solely as proof-of-work (proof that the construction workers did their job). You actually USE the bank to DO THINGS.
