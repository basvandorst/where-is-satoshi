More "opinions" just like those submitted by credit rating agencies during the subprime mortgage crisis. 
Judging by JPM's 170+ attempts to patent an alternative, the generally kleptocratic nature of the financial sector, and this slanderous argument asserting how there is an some kind of inferiority in a commodity that takes ultimate monetary sovereignty back from the governments and banks and places it in the hands of the people, they are just publishing this to act in their own best interest. Perhaps to drive the exchange rate further down for more banksters to hop on the train?

Still a true stigma, but not reason to be a laggard. The real question is when Bitcoin 2.0 will be created (it may already exist) for distribution to the international community.

This is very relevant with the "Bitcoin Price vs. Metcalfe Value" graph that's been floating around. It's proof of the law of supply and demand, and this telecommunications network is accessible to anybody with a computer.
