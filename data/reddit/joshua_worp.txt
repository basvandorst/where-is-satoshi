Becouse to send a coin using a paper wallet you need to expose your private key, and once exposed the private key is no longer completely secure ... I personally do not like paper wallets because it is not practical, although it is very secure.

In bitaddress.org you can safely generate a paper wallet, but I do not advise becouse it is not practical to send coins.  I suggest you buy a hardware wallet.  Yes!  You can send multiple times to the same public address as your paper wallet as your security will be high, but your privacy will not.  The major security problem of paper wallets is the sending of coins and not the receipt, because when sending a coin you can only do it once, and then you should discard the paper wallet.

BTC is Fiat money because humanity can provide its own currencies, but without the need of the State. Many people confuse the fact that Fiat money needs the state, because never before was it possible, but today it is possible because of cryptocurrency. Btc has intrinsic value, just like a dollar bill! I can wipe my ass or make paper airplanes, but no one does that, because the STATE says that this paper is worth $ 100, or $ 50, that is, its value does not represent its utility, as well as BTC, its value of US $ 10000 does not really represent its usefulness, since anyone can create their decentralized currency, such as LTC, DASH, etc. Its value, like gold, is given by speculation, most do not pay for gold because it is a good conductor of electricity!, believe me! Therefore, what was needed before the state provided, today cryptocurrency comes from private mode and not public.

You look like an old scratched disc just says the same thing!
What is the difference between a decree and a rule in the BTC algorithm?
There is no difference, only one difference, one is made by the STATE to another by a group of developers!
Both are formulated and can be adjusted modified, for example, Satoshi Nakamoto decreed 21 Million BTC!

ok! 
Then explain the reason to me!
Explain to me why. Do you know?
Well I know!
Fiat money needs the state, because only the state could reduce the transaction costs arising from the opportunist attitudes of agents in the economy!
The BTC broke this rule !!!
We do not need the STATE! We do not need a regulatory agent! THIS CONQUEST WAS THE BTC CREATORS!
So Btc is the first Fiat Money without the need of the State ... Update your concepts!
