My wallet is what’s sore. I’m buying Bitcoin every day with whatever chump change I have
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:02:25
I buy on Cash App. I think the lowest I’ve purchased is like $1. They don’t really have transaction fees tbh

Oh okay, I wasn’t sure. They have a both Buy and Sell button for BTC.

Bitcoin has been tested in various environments and has managed to survive thus far. It has survived economic tensions in different countries, it has survived hard forks, bubble pops, etc. 
I think Bitcoin is battle-hardened and can handle a little bs.
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:43:31
I like this idea.
@_date: 2019-03-10 06:26:38
Would it be possible to sell Bitcoin from within the app, though? Then fund the card with USD from the sale?
@_date: 2019-03-09 20:41:30
I think maybe Cash App has a free debit card if I’m not mistaken.
@_date: 2019-03-25 01:41:16
I’ve heard of Bitcoin back since 2012, but I never truly understood what Bitcoin meant until I understood the value of paper money, credit, inflation, etc. 
Bitcoin is all but a name to many, until they’re forced to learn what Bitcoin is, via other means than just leaving paper in a tip jar full of fiat that already “works”.

@_date: 2019-02-17 03:37:54
This reminds me of The Death of Money with Andreas Antonopoulos. The part where he mentions us moving towards a future of digital money, where the government can control your funds and do harm if they don’t like who you are or what you do. A future where decentralized currencies will really show utility.

I hold my crypto as a gamble that I’ll have wealth in my hands, should the traditional currencies fail. I suppose I use crypto for the same reason others use gold.

You still pay taxes. You’re selling your crypto for fiat, and using that fiat from the transaction to make a new transaction, to pay for whatever it is you’re using the card for.

Why would the Bitcoin creator reveal himself, and put a target on his back? The next day we would just find out that he happened to die in some “car accident”. He’s a threat to governments, and the system.
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:42:26
I think Coinbase played a role with not listing XRP when people wanted it to happen. At the time Coinbase was like the “gatekeeper” for crypto. I believe CoinMarketCap also messed with some numbers they display, which in turn messed with investor sentiment. I can’t remember what else.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:55:53
Banks and governments are a mafia, and Bitcoin threatens to disrupt their plans, by giving control and power of money to the people. Quantitative Easing, and all these financial tools are used to make the rich even more rich, and make the lower class of society inescapable debt slaves.
@_date: 2019-04-28 19:20:11
The case is still the same. Whether he comes out of the closet himself, or whether it’s a result of other people snooping around, or whatever other reason you can think of, the effort is not so much in the revealing, but the concealing.

If you just wanna delete the Coinbase account, move the coins offline and delete. I don’t think it’s worth spending them on Amazon tbh

The point of money is to exchange value. It doesn’t matter if it’s liquid, solid, digital, etc. The value is what matters.

Cut expenses. If you normally eat fast food at least once a month, don’t. Download Cash App and spend those $5 in BTC. You could even buy as low as $1, without fees.
I’ve had to make many sacrifices and adjustments to my life in order to buy crypto. For example, instead of constantly paying for haircuts, I invested one-time in a hair trimmer, and now give myself haircuts. The haircut money that I didn’t pay to a barber instead goes to crypto.
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:05:46
Get on Cash App. You can buy Bitcoin with as little as $1, and you don’t pay fees.

Interesting how it’s backed by the Chinese government.
@_date: 2019-05-05 06:33:11
This totally reminds me of what Andreas Antonopoulos said in The Death of Money. In a future of digital currencies, if the government doesn’t like who you politically support, poof, you’re offline.

People will need a hedge for their stock money though, and crypto is literally the next viable option in some apps, such as Robinhood. That will further expand to other stock brokers as time goes on, as we’ve seen that some are testing BTC trading and whatnot.
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:01:18
As soon as possible. That not much today will be much tomorrow. Look up the Nano Ledger S.

I would do it, only because I believe that we’ve already reached the bottom of the cycle and it can only go up from here. I don’t believe that Bitcoin will go to $0 for the foreseeable future. 
I accept that it’s risky to take debt for the investment. You take the loan and not only are you fighting interest, but currency inflation, and so on. I like risk though.
Not financial advice tho, just what I would do.
