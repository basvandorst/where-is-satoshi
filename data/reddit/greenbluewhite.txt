Solar panels have a quarter the output on Mars that they do on Earth.  The most important use for electricity on Mars is generating water, air, and rocket propellant.  Though the waste heat from a few coin miners might be useful.  With such a small population the transaction rate will be low.
Anyway, Musk is not planning on building a civilization on Mars. He is planning on how to get people and equipment there so that _they_ can build a civilization.  They will not need money for quite a while.

There are other failure scenarios.  Major internet outage that isolates China (natural or man-made), Chinese miners deciding that BCC is preferable and stopping doing BTC.
Next largest mining country is Iceland, with 5% of the hashrate.

What happens to classic Bitcoin if China just shuts down it's mines?  Imagine what happens to worldwide transaction processing rates.

Yes, you have to show what you paid for it.  Otherwise you pay tax on the entire amount you sell it for, rather than just the difference between sell and buy price.

There _are_ plenty reports of frozen accounts, transactions that never resolve, and other reasons for needing to contact customer service in the first place.
