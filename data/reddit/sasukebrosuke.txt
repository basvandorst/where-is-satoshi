Why is everyone so surprised when stuff like this has happened through out history. If you could keep your money would you keep it on the internet or with you personally where noone can take it ( cold storage ). It's like cash, you keep it at a bank. If that bank decides to go bankrupt your money is gone too. It's just that it doesn't happen very often in 1st world countries. Those quadriga traders kept it on an exchange. Where it is always chanted here "Never keep your coins on an exchange!" If you really wanted to pass BTC down a generation. Store your cold wallet in a  safety vault. Give access to whoever to the safety vault in your will. Moral is to have control of YOUR money, YOUR assets and most importantly YOUR Bitcoin.

If the BTC were truly lost, it won't kill BTC nor make BTC dissapear. It would just further increase the price of other BTC. BTC has several units going all the way down to Satoshis.
