With BTC+Bca$h+Bgold prices adding to 11.83+1.64+0.33k = 13.8k* 1 million = 13.8 billion USD 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:21:01
Thanks for the explanation
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:03:56
Do you think noobs investing for first time might have invested in BCash thinking them as bitcoin which is resulting in thier price rise?
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:01:24
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:08:27
Tell him either to buy it from market or if he is attached for your BTC let him pay 5k for it.
If he takes second option come back and buy 1.25 of it 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:16:31
So does this mean we are heading to a Hardfork now?
Whats the chances of this happening?
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:02:02
I know it might have been old news.
But wanted to know it so it's news for me anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:57:09
It is an alternate URL owned by bittrex.com.
The URL when hit redirects to bittrex.com. 
But be careful anyway
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:25:42
Who will.be responsible for Infrastructure like Road, Airports
And who build schools
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:25:06
Don't get me wrong.
I am huge supporter and investor in BTC.
But I would still want govt to be responsible for building infrastructure, schools etc 
For which they have to collect taxes anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:16:40
What happens if the Fork doesn't happen?
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:38:09
Is this a site or an app
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:15:21
Did you check the block chain register for your transaction??
What's the status showing. 
Don't worry as long as you're sure you have not typed BCH address you are fine 
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:54:13
I am not sure what you heard. 
But there are two forks happening (hence two countdowns).
One BTCGold for which recent rally was reason.. that fork is complete.
Next is Segwit2x fork this is expected during Nov this year..
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:07:19
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:56:33
If the prices he quotes does happen.
Then you are better off buying a ETH 300 USD to 200K
Than a Bitcoin for 4500 USD to 500K.
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:44:34
Can someone clarify on this..
What's bittrex stand on BTC Gold split.
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:12:03
Are you sure, I did read somehwhere that it has to be created before the lock in timeline which is July 21 or 23
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:04:27
Ya it was in coinomi all this while.
Thier only message was don't worry. You have to do nothing 
But no message on if we will get equal amount in bcc. My communication to them have gone futile.
I am too scared to try paper wallet option as I have not done it till now.
@_date: 2017-07-15 06:47:19
Unfortuately in India we only have few avenues of buying BTC, and this was one of it..
Looks like they had some glitch in the website which is sorted out now.
Was not allowed to withdraw for sometime in the morning which resulted in FUD
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:02:50
So ironically, the fees we are paying to Visa / Paypall will get converted into BitCoin fees (considering the high value this would have become that time). 
We will end up being the evil we intended to avoid in the first place. Nice
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:59:35
Can someone say based on this timeline what is the cut off date before which I should create a Cold storage / paper wallet for my BTCs 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:22:18
We should call him Natoshi Sakamoto
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:54:26
so its pornhub 5 times a day vs real thing 5 times a day..
What a challenge to have in life..
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:45:49
Let me explain as requested.
I need to ensure before any type of fork happens, I want to secure my BTC so that I can keep it away from impact of any type of fork.
My question is specific to when will the last block be processed before the Fork will happen, this is to ensure that if I move my coins into wallets, I need to have Bitcoins in both the side of Forks
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:02:28


So going by what you are saying. Its enough if I make my paper wallets by 31 July. Correct?
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:57:29
This means we can literally trade nothing there..
Cos all thier currencies are exchanged against BTC.
Why not close the whole exchange instead of this.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:04:40
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:27:27
That's for hardly 15% of currency. It's for those which are built on Erthereum platform
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:05:32
Yes even I am confused by the mail not sure what thier stand it. 
Till now only Bitfinex has been crystal clear among major players on what thier stand is. Hats off to them
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:09:52
Thanks and apologies
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:55:02
Well then does it imply the advantage of BTC is nullified for intra country transactions??
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:10:40
Correct thats exactly what I was looking for. 
I guess  is a good link given by one of the users
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:23:46
Ya they changed timelines three times already.
That gives me creeps
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:28:52
:) don't think so..
But in an utopian world may be you can. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:16:51
Thanks for being honest :)
Appreciate it
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:26:18
Then it's not applicable for average use like buying a coffee or paying my hotel bill. Cos they are hardly in 0.035BTC. 
That removes almost 60% of potential used 
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:52:41
Those updates are outdated, they have missed thier timelines three time already. 
Now we have a generic update saying we need more time. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:50:11
I agree..I am a huge fan of Zebpay. 
I had maxed out on Zebpay thats why choose Unocoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:23:01
Well almost.
Other than this and zebpay we don't have any direct markets.
Remaining are just OTC providers
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:08:21
Problem is they dont seperately track BTCUSD. Even exchanges are also included.
Good link though thanks
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:53:11
Just because there are less players doesnt make them big
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:10:09
This is good, except it doesnt simulatneously display cost in all exchanges. 
I guess  is a good link given by one of the users
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:18:11
Very well put, thanks
But you again emphasize on factors like trust on bank and removal of authority approving it.
While this will appeal to me and you who are bought into this philosophy, for an average Joe trying to buy a coffee (for e.g.) he would see the transition getting done sooner at a shop accepting credit card than a shop working on BTC.
That's my question is it efficient enough at the end to appeal to average Joe. If it doesn't then we will loose 70% potential converts cos they are impatient and hardly care abt philosophy 
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:10:02

If some place is as ancient that there is no ATM I can't believe it would have kiosk or users accepting BTC as well.
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:49:30
There you go another change in the commitment.
The Site had mentioned they will be up by 9:30 today. 
And they missed thier set target again. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:24:22
Thanks for the information.
I am having doubts how do the BTC ATM and shops accepting BTC working these days.
It must be a hell of a waiting time will peeps keep waiting in front of ATM for hours will people wait til their payment is paid in the hotel
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:29:50
When was the last time you sent money abroad at least an year or two back right 
Think abt when you used money within the country. Are we saying BTC efficients a thing that I do once in two years 
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:55:45
I am from India, inter banks transactions hardly takes a minute to reflect
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:51:45
Coinsecure doesnt accept Credit card buying. 
Imagine if there is a surge, you had to deposit 20K and wait for it to be credited to your User ID and then buy. 
By that time the prices would have changed drastically. I am not a fan of providers working on BAnk credit option, looks pretty dated for Bitcoin purchases
