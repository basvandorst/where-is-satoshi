Bitcoin is by no means the only way of transferring money abroad with low fees.  They could have mentioned dozens of services.  It's not the job of a the public state broadcaster to advertise services, which is exactly what you're asking for - especially when that advertisement could potentially make people a lot of money.
Imagine if the BBC did mention it, sending the BTC price up.  Then somebody found out a BBC trust executive held a couple of thousand BTC.  Nice awkward moment for all involved.

I was most definitely not being sarcastic.  Well done you for doing very well on BTC, but it's definitely not an "investment strategy" you should teach people (which is the whole point of that subreddit).  The reason index funds are popular is because they produce better than average returns in the long run, *not* because you're going to make lots of money.
There are lots of companies that if you research and pick well early, and commit a decent amount of cash, you'll do very well.  99% of people are not skilled enough to reliably pick those companies, and in the long run, will lose money, which is why index funds are great.

Bitcoin might do all those things.  Alternatively, one of a myriad of alternative digital crypto-currencies might take hold instead, or another form or digicoin promoted by a major company, like the Amazon coin.  Any myriad of things might happen.  You have no idea, I have no idea, nobody has any idea.  The opinions of experts, as well as common sense, are hugely over valued, and more often than not, wrong.  Being in the business of predicting the future tends to lead to shitty business.
Making money of bitcoin is predicated on the market maturing and bitcoin becoming the major digital currency.  Gold remaining valuable is pretty much guaranteed for the next couple of decades.
Again, I'm not saying DONT keep some cash in BC - the returns are stellar, if incredibly risky.  But if you gave me a million USD to invest, only a complete idiot would invest even half of that into bitcoin - you'd utterly wreck the market, for one.  But putting half in gold would probably be just fine.  You'd keep it safe, and do acceptably well.

My income isn't in BTC - that's still taxed.  I still pay a huge amount of taxes.  I really don't own enough BTC to do any sort of illegal tax evasion with it.
Also, avoiding taxes is fine and perfectly legal.  I have no problem with that at all.  It's every man's duty to pay as few taxes as possible, as far as I'm concerned.  But I don't think he can just decide to not pay them, if he's living in a democratic country where everybody else wants him to.  He can change the mind of the majority, or he can change country.

I'd argue that if you live in a democratic society, then no, it doesn't infringe on your rights, because you can either move, or put forward an alternative and convince your fellow citizens to vote for it.  If you decide to do neither of those things, I think you're in the wrong.
Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a bit of a moral quandary - at what level does taxation become government mandated theft? - but I still don't think that in this day and age you can legitimately claim that paying your taxes is somehow infringing on your rights, if you live in the developed world.  If you live in Zimbabwe for instance it's kind of a different ballgame.

You're right in that those checks and balanced are often murky, and hard to define, and corruptible.  However, without taxes, it is *impossible* to build huge infrastructure like interstate highways, or railways or broadband.
  Even if a single company could get enough cash to build those things, they wouldn't invest because they'd like the security given by government - knowing that people honour their contracts, because there is such thing as rule of law, and knowing that if people don't big men in uniforms will come get them.  That there is *trust* in market mechanisms working, to a point.
Again, it's not perfect.  But people paying taxes voluntarily isn't an alternative, as any legitimate economist who understands behavioural economics will tell you.  And not somebody from Russia Today.

You are seriously over-estimating the average human being if you think they have any idea what is good for them.

We're oversized primates who, given the choice, are far happier sitting in our basements eating massive portions of junk food because our genes are preparing for the next famine than actually rationally thinking about what we'll need tomorrow, let alone next week or next year.
Again, nobody would pay for traffic wardens.  Cities would come to a standstill - because you'd have a massive free rider problem of people using up space they don't actually need, because they're not charged for it.  Market failure at it's clearest.
Oh, and if you think the US government going out of business would be "just fine", you are seriously ignoring a lot of warnings from history.  I mean, sure, if you think the dark ages were "just fine", but it would still be pretty damn bad.

I agree.  But as it happens, most developed democracies today have agree'd on a system of centralised government and taxation.  Anarcho-libertarian parties who want to go the other way are in the extreme minority.  We probably could live in a system built like that, and I'd be interested in taking part in that sort of experiment, but seeing I'm currently living in the UK, where the vast majority of people support our current system of centralised parliamentary democracy, I don't think I can reap the rewards of that system, like heavily subsidised roads, schooling, medical care, and even policing - I don't want to go back to the pre 1800 system of criminal law based purely on bounty hunting - without agreeing to that and paying some tax.  As little as I can get away with, but I definitely wouldn't feel morally right just saying fuck you and paying nothing at all.
@_date: 2013-03-16 16:22:12
No, it wouldn't - which is why most civilised countries, like the UK and the US, have some sort of check against the tyranny of the majority, and situations like that don't happen.  There are strict rules about government building on private land and compensation.
  That being said, we should have a far bigger say in how are taxes are spent, and I for one believe in far smaller states with a smaller tax take.   That doesn't mean I can decide not to pay my taxes if I don't want to.  Our current governments tend to be far too illiberal with how they spend money, and spend far too much on crap we don't need.  I should be damn entitled to go online and allocate my taxes to different public services, and one day, I will.
That being said, if I tell the tax man I have an income of $5000 when it's actually $40000, I'm definitely a tax cheat and have definitely done something morally wrong, in my mind.  If I arrange to be paid in a foreign currency from a different country, and thus actually reduce my taxable income, then I'm just being savy and responsible.
It's every man's responsibility to pay as few taxes as possible.  That doesn't mean you can chose to just not pay them.

RAAAAH.  You're right, but please don't tell him he should "study some objectivism".  It's not a fucking economics textbook, it's philosophical discourse.  Ayn Rand didn't mean them as instructions manuals.
He's also right, because if the taxman comes to your door and starts complaining, unless you're planning on beating them over the head with a copy of Atlas Shrugged - which would probably work actually, because of that insanely long damn monologue - objectivism will help all of fuck all.
Bring on the downvotes.  I'm a huge fan of objectivism, but god damn I hate when people ignore reality for the sake of philosophy.  That's why economics is so fubared as a science.

As an economics graduate...no.  The latest high speed train line in the UK was just approved, and costs £30 billion to make.  No private company, or syndicate, has that much money. Before the creation of a national police force in 1842, you just had hired thugs and bounty hunters.  Nobody wants to make those because a) they cost more money than anybody has and b) massive free rider issue.  The US road network costs more to maintain per year than any single company can afford.

This...would not work well.  It might work very well for paying for PART of the state - you know, some medical expenses, some benefits - but not for a lot of rather key things, like, you know, roads, or parking, or a lot of other things.
If you could entirely chose how much and where your taxes were paid, do you really think ANYBODY would decide to pay for traffic wardens?  But if you study cities back in the 1950s before parking legislation was enforced, actually commuting was impossible and that was a huge roadblock for business.
So yes, maybe part voluntary/charity, but far more on things like sales tax, I suspect.

Again, not entirely disagreeing with you - I think we should pay far fewer taxes, and that we should have more say in where they go - but we humans are terrible at being rational and seeing the big pictures, and sometimes the market isn't completely perfect for everything.  I don't think you have the right to live in a democracy and ignore the wishes of the majority completely.

Your ignorance regarding China is rather hilarious.  People are illegally detained in China *all the time*.  Secret police grab them off the street, and they disappear.  They send them to labour camps, or kill them, and that's it.  It happens all the time, and  you'd know it if you'd actually spent any time there.  Also, the fact that the two sources you've found are RT and the damn Mail Online is laughable.  Also, for the record, there are very strict rules in the US about taking people's private property - the government can't just take things.  But hey, you keep believing that.  Although one day, you should maybe fly somewhere really totalitarian and live there for a year, see how you feel after that.
Also, if the democratically mandated law said you were forced t o have babies, then that would be a whole different question.  But it doesn't, and never will, because that wouldn't pass in any civilised democratic society.  Look, I agree that it's not an easy moral question, but the vast majority of educated, civilised democratic societies agree it's the right thing to do - so you're just going to have to pay your taxes, until you go establish the mystical anarcho-capitalist commune on the seasteading institute or set up an intergalactic colony.

If you live in a democracy and disagree with the social covenant that requires you to pay taxes to pay for government, then either get elected into government, or move.  It's a tyranny of the majority, and proposes all sorts of ethical quandaries, but we live in a world where moving is relatively easy - if you decide to refuse to pay any taxes at all, yet live in a developed country, I'm sorry, but I can't entirely sympathise.

That's what they told Lehman, and look how that worked out.
Also, Bitcoin isn't really relevant here.  We're talking billions of dollars - sums bitcoin is not solid or tested enough to deal with yet.  There just isn't the market cap.

No, it isn't, because gay marriage doesn't have any effect on people who aren't gay and married.  If you suddenly decide to stop paying for road maintenance, or basic medication, or traffic wardens, then the country will grind to a halt and people will die, because stuff like building highways or train tracks doesn't work unless you're a massive entity with a huge amount of capital to spend.
You're not entirely wrong, and you're right that it's a moral quandary.  You're right that at the end of the day, it does come down to the fact that I think I have the better system, and I happen to have the majority, the establishment, and the army on my side.  
You are however, completely wrong in comparing the US to Zimbabwe.  That comes from the entitled American ignorance of what totalitarianism really is - people who never lived on the other side of the Berlin wall, never worried the secret police were going to come drag their families out of bed at 2 in the morning for disagreeing with the government or reading the wrong book.

Of course not - that infringes my fundamental human rights, and there should be checks and balances against the tyranny of the majority precisely for that reason.

That seems to be my best bet, actually.

I wonder if the ethical non-monogamy crowd and the bitcoin crowd intersect at all..

Wow, this article is full of some serious tin-foil-hattery.


That is not "the bottom line", that is you making shit up.
Oh wait, just noticed it's Keiser.  Why am I not surprised.  I've been following Bitcoin for the last 2 weeks and he's responsible for half the madness I see.  And I suspect he's making a pretty penny of it.

No.  It's entirely fucking different.  The president does not make random phone calls to get the head of AT&amp;T suddenly swapped with his countepart at Verizon.  If you think that happens in the US, you need to go easy on the crazy pills.

As little as possible, while obeying the law.  If you chose to live in a democratic country, you chose to obey the law mandated by the majority as long as that law doesn't infringe your fundamental human rights.

Is there a source for that?  Because people are just making shit up as far as I can tell.

I still haven't found anything as cheap and convenient for 1 or 2 bitcoin transactions.  I think our best bet is probably harassing Blockchain until they tell us wtf is going on.

Although, study after study has shown it has far more to do with being lucky than being a "pro".  First rule of finance: most experts don't do particularly well when you test them scientifically, and telling the future is a bad business model.

The steering comittee doesn't go over every piece of CCTV news.  Chinese politics goes in massive campaigns that ebb and flow.

Honestly, there really aren't THAT many reasons to "swap" over yet, at least not for the average consumer though.   My main reasons?
1) It's cool!  It's nerdy, and cryptographic, and awesome and nerdy
2) Returns.  Honestly, the value of 1BTC has gone up like hell
3) Low fees.  Ish.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:29:42
Awesome, let us know what's up.  I want to at least know WHY it's happening :(

If you're in France, Bitcoin Central is probably your best bet.  The best exchange is usually the ones  you can transfer cash to domestically, meaning you avoid annoying fees.

Are you going to build your own motorways?  Research your own designer drugs?  Are you just going to let talented people die of starvation because they happened to be born in a poor family?  
Again, don't get me wrong - great theory, and ten or so years ago I would have agreed with you.  I've just found that like communism, it really doesn't work so well in practise, because it ignores the fact we're big primates deep down.  There is a reason we don't all live in huts in the forest without any form of government.

That's not at all how it works.  The bureau of propaganda provides guidelines every week, and key things that need to be highlighted, or direct copies of articles.  Other  than that, you're pretty much on your own.  The "leadership" probably doesn't really care yet.

Well, then I'll move, and go to somewhere that isn't America.  I'm not sure how having a gun will help.

How much did you pay in BTC?
