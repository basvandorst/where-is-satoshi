I just installed this, if anyone is looking for an address to test it out, you can send me a message and I'll reply to tell you I got it.

Shoestring worries me when they are handling your money.

Did you send a money order or ACH?

What happens when I get to the hotel and they ask for credit card I booked with? (this happens quite regularly). And playing devils advocate; What happens if I trash the room, dont pay for room-service, steal the towels? Your credit card is on file and I'm nearly anonymous.

**De-centralized search** strikes me as something the bitcoin community could get behind.  
I know a lot of people feel that Google has that orwellian oversight in to too many
of our lives but that the other options out there (duckduckgo.com being the mostly
cited alternative) are lacking in quality results.  
I've been using Faroo, a de-centralized search crawler and engine for the last year
and I'm massivly impressed with the quality of the results.  
Here's an example:  
  
You can install the faroo client, and then use the windows key+S to launch Faroo
search in your browser (running on localhost).  
**Search queries are encrypted, ~~the software is open source~~, the system is de-centralized
and the results are fast and relevant (and get better the more people use it).  **
EDIT: I said it's open source.  It's not. ugh Seppuku time.

A quickly climbing dollar price for BTC creates a drop in altcoin price. Why? Because nearly all altcoin trading is done for BTC. If PPC/BTC is at 0.008 and bitcoin doubles in price instantly. Your PPC is now at 0.004 BTC each BUT the dollar value is still relative.

Sarcasm I'm sure. It's typically called BrainWallet Mining - this guy does it and returns the funds (

This is the feeling I've been getting from reading support questions in various places on the net. Hmmm...

Is yours a USD withdrawal though? There are known problems there.

Thanks, schooled. Your logic wins.

Cool, ok. Is sending a money order in the post any safer than cash? Just wondering if there any protections.

I always take a screenshot for the QR code and put it in my encrypted backup. That will also work right? Just double checking I don't to start panicking.
