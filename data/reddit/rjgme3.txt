You could probably do something similar with a dremel tool or even a small center punch on a piece of stainless.  They make fiber lasers that oxidize the top surface and create the perfect qr code that is nearly white and black.

True,  could you imagine the cost to manufacture just excavator and everything inside of it broken down to the component level... it looks like bitcoin isiz an mprovement.   If something doesn't take energy to obtain what value would it have.  If gold was all over the place and anyone could go outside and grab as much as they wanted it would be priced similar to rocks.

I slowly migrated towards bitcoin too and it's a large chunk,  it's funny the first thing is to grab a bunch of alt coins because you're blinded by the bright lights of opportunity and you hit good gains, then all the sudden they come down by 30% here and there with short runs to keep you interested.

Why do you really need to polish the metal,  304 is available prefinished and even if it wasn't the surface finish isn't bad unless you're using a casting, is there something else you gain from doing that? Even so a dremel could cut as deep as you want to go.   Honestly I would prefer the stampings like you mentioned  but it's not accurate to say one goes deeper than the other,  you could have someone that doesn't apply any force to the hammer and only swings it from an inch away, the impression could be barely legible

Taxation is not really theft, I appreciate a lot of things in my country that my taxes pay for.   There are some areas that need a little more transparency,  but the taxation is not slavery, that's pretty extreme...

I was in China a few months ago and they paid almost everything using a bar code on their phone.   It definitely wasn't bitcoin or crypto in general because I was talking to them about it that, it was definitely rnb

Since paper money and coins consume energy to mint should we just go digital with fiat altogether?  We get rid of physical money but we still have to pay for electricity to transfer money?  There has to be a ledger maintained and updated at each location to ensure people aren't spending more than what's in their accounts?

Awesome work,  this is pretty cool, wish I was around those areas!

I fully support and understand that bitcoin needs to be used,  I would love to use mine more.  The current problem is where I live I pass by over 100 businesses on the way home from work,  all take card/ cash and none take bitcoin.

Where did you find this out at?  It would be awesome if someone started keeping records of these banks wallets so we can watch things move rather than wait for another shitty article with a cool sketch to appear and tell us what happened 8 hours ago

I honestly don't want an etf, I don't think it belongs, it would be worst than tether.  I want a fully decentralized market place ran on crypto to replace Amazon; all of the profit directly to the seller; eyes will open.
@_date: 2018-11-05 12:06:45
We don't need an ETF we need a decentralized market place so large it takes over Bitcoin, this generates a true use case where only digital currency can be exchanged.

Absolutely there are so keep good records and hodl.

Some thing that comes to mind with this is giving more folks ways to invest in it, not just with pocket change or extra cash.   With a 401k or even an HSA account you are some times limited to what you can invest in; there will be a list of stocks, mutual funds,  ETF's to pick from.   If I were to pull my money out and buy gold/ bitcoin I would take a penalty.  If an ETF was available for me in gold/ bitcoin I could invest without penalty.   This could unleash a massive amount cash for the market.   I do understand the whole deal with some one else holding your coins,  I don't like that part and can imagine at some point someone will shit the bed and lose all of their client's coins.

Where ever there's money or money to be made there's regulation in this world.
