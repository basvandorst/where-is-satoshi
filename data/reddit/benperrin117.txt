You're right at the moment, but 20 years ago the same was thought about things like personal computers and email. When today's kids grow up with digital currency, security practices will be second nature. Not to mention we'll continue to get better apps and products for security, which will make keeping your funds safe a lot simpler than it currently is.
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:50:10
Good point. It's a very good idea to only load funds that you plan on using in the immediate future.

Great article! Arthur was a super nice guy when I met him in Hong Kong just a couple weeks ago. He was nice enough to set aside some time for me and be in one of my videos. Great to see people in the crypto space be so welcoming.
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:48:59
I think because there are some instances still where you simply cannot pay with bitcoin. I would love if I could just use BTC for everything as I travel the globe, but that's unfortunately not the current reality. This is just one of those temporary products that bridges the gap, I suppose.

@_date: 2016-08-26 06:58:59
I don't think this is very fair. In general, we all have the same goal of increased capacity &amp; adoption. Some people just have a different preferred method of how we get there.
Some are worried that a slow/conservative approach carries the risk of Bitcoin being left behind in favour of other cryptos, or perhaps a new centralized bank solution. Others worry that if we move too hastily mistakes will be made in the code and set us back, resulting in the same outcome. Both views have merit IMO.

This is the story of my life. Until bitcoin I was never able to do any real saving unless I was working toward something like a big trip. Now I've been stashing money away for 2.5 years and haven't had the urge to spend it. Even when the price was down, I was still better off because I would have spent the money on something else anyways.

Most people won't listen and would rather come to their own conclusions. For many people I'm sure they'll never fully come around, and it will instead be the younger generations that will have enough of an open mind to see the promise here. I'm not very phased by scepticism anymore, and I let those people keep believing what they want. Your time is much better spent talking with people who are willing to at least learn a bit before passing judgement.

I don't think this is at all possible. The richest person on the planet (Bill Gates) currently has just over $80 billion. If 1 satoshi was $1000, then anyone with a single bitcoin would be richer than him. There is not enough fiat currency on the planet for there to be 21 million Bill Gates'.

Depends if you're referring to M3 or if you're also including stocks, derivatives, precious metals and things like that. 
M3 is around 80 trillion, so Bill would have 0.1% of that. If you add in the other stuff then yes it would take you into the quadrillions and give him a smaller percentage.

Good question. At first I thought we would basically be human fad items like Beanie Babies. Basically worthless unless you happen to be the flavour of the week.

This is not a coinjoin video.
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:58:18
To be fair, I went through:
* where to download
* setup &amp; backup
* an overview of the UI
* funding the wallet
* doing a coinjoin
* sending coins back out
* explaining UTXO's and what good privacy practices are
Executing the coinjoin function itself was only 2.5 minutes of the video.
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:11:22
Yes you can, but if an exchange starts limiting coins that have been part of a coinjoin recently, it's negligible to simply add some hops on between before sending to them. In fact Samourai wallet has a feature called ricochet that does exactly this. It was rolled out in response to Coinbase flagging coins that had been on gambling sites.

So you're of the opinion that BTC's value at the moment is primarily derived from the fact that it can be mined?
If that line of thinking is followed then it should stand to reason that block halvings and planned scarcity would result in price decreases over time.  Do you think that will be the case in the time following the next halving? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:15:54
I missed the part where 1BTC dipped below 1BTC.

@_date: 2018-09-05 22:30:42
True, but BTC tends to get way less REKT than alts on the way down. If you lose 95% buying an alt at the top, you now need a 1900% gain to recover. Many will likely never return to where they once were in terms of bitcoin AND dollars.
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:15:51
It's a joke. You must be fun at parties. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:27:14
No worries!
Also that's how a lot of BTC maximalists try to think. It's not about short term dollar swings, it's about the accumulation of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:58:18
1. It's a joke
2. The point of the joke is that most alts won't ever recover in terms of BTC, they'll simply be replaced by new shitcoins while Bitcoin remains. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:59:24
I did :) My handle is 
@_date: 2015-12-23 23:41:18
I would disagree with this statement. Yes it is incredibly risky and no one should ever put more money into something than they can afford to lose... but if you're comfortable with the risk then why not? The potential return is still quite large if it continues to grow.

Edit: Why "Blockchain" is the new intra-net.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:23:58
Ohhhhh I see what you mean. All existing BTC still functions at that point though, so I wouldn't necessarily consider it an expiry date. In my eyes it's more akin to if all the available gold on earth were mined - the available asset would still be usable and unaffected (other than the bonus of being scarce). 
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:04:35
Yeah it's not exactly what I was expecting. Baby steps, I guess. We're getting closer.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:13:19

@_date: 2015-12-11 16:39:30
It's definitely not too late. Don't think of the current price of a single bitcoin right now, because that's not a fair marker. Think of it more like owning a percentage of a currency. There will only ever ben 21,000,000 bitcoins. That means owning a single bitcoin is essentially owning 0.00000005% of a global currency. If you owned the same percentage of US dollars (assuming around 12 Trillion based on the Federal Reserve Website), you would currently hold around $571,000. 
I'm not saying that it will scale like this, but just to give it some perspective... I think bitcoin is still reasonably priced right now, if not cheap.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:50:11
Probably, but the point of the post is to accumulate and stop valuing BTC in dollars. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:08:45
So, I'm still a little foggy as to what this is, and what it does?

Stories like these just make me smile. Thanks so much for sharing!
@_date: 2015-12-24 00:05:25
Tell us how you REALLY feel.
I'd also disagree with that statement as well. I think that while speculation is not the original use case for bitcoin, it will help build up the market cap in the coming years so that it can be used on a grander scale. 
Then again, what do I know? I'm just some fucking guy on reddit. Like you.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:28:04
Do you mean why would people still be miners? Transaction fees were always meant to replace block reward eventually. It'll be a gradual shift, but in the coming decades the majority of mining revenues will come from fees.
If you're referring to the asset itself, the fact that no more can be obtained would push the value up (assuming it's still widely used at that point). 
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:00:52
You jinxed it. 
Not for long though.
@_date: 2015-12-11 16:21:17

More or less he was outlining the conflict with the impending fork and the attempted block of segwit. It was officially locked in before the interview, so his response was "Its over. We won." I didn't realize it then but he was very right. The worry of hard forks and attempted blocking of optimization via soft fork is no longer a worry. We now see that Bitcoin is resistant to these types of attempts to centralize control our subvert the voices of every day users. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 13:54:04
I used the opportunity to pick up. Seems to be solid resistance at $400USD, so I'll just count this as a boxing day discount :)
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:36:01
I agree in a sense. If a user is interested in ANY coin on their platform, they should have assurances that the wallet will handle the coin in an efficient manner. That said, I also understand that if they aren't profitable then they cease to grow and eventually cease to exist. 
I hope that the end of the shitcoin rallies shifts focus back to the one currency that actually has users instead of just speculators.

On the contrary, Phil tends to be a bit more maximalist than I expected when speaking with him behind the scenes. I believe he is one of the team members really pushing to ensure BTC is given the attention it deserves.
It seems the issue is that the head guys are very meticulous and hate when every single asset wallet experience isn't 100% the same. Not trying to excuse this ridiculous delay, but merely give some clarity into their thinking.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:31:38
Yeah I'd agree there. Seems like it should have been a simple fix that maybe just took a bit of extra consideration to not confuse people. I think there's little excuse at this point. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:49:47
Figured I'd further clarify what was discussed regarding SW outside the interview. From my understanding, Phil said it was very easy to implement segwit itself, but the issue was how to make the transition as user friendly as possible. This ended up taking a backseat to adding new assets, which I also addressed my concerns about in the interview. It was very much stressed that their  concern is having the easiest possible UI and that it be consistent across every single coin they offer. Their worries were:
1. Confusion among newbies about the new address format
2. If they gave the option of both legacy and SW they would receive a million tickets
3. If they chose to move to segwit, how do they easily transfer balances to the new format (or instruct users to do so, given that exodus doesn't hold private keys)
While I wasn't 100% satisfied with the answers here, I was also assured that segwit is actively being worked on and all that needs to be decided is how to make it pretty for current users.

I'd agree. Up until this month I was very hesitant at the idea of getting paid in bitcoin. Now I'm seriously considering it, and my boss seems to be on board as well. The only thing I don't think I'll be able to pay is my car, because my payments HAVE to come out of a bank account.
A lot of my friends have also become quite interested in the last few weeks now that I've successfully survive the month. I think they see it as more legitimate now.

I very highly recommend reading "How To Win Friends and Influence People". Contrary to the title, the book is all about coming to mutual understandings, and really taking the time to see the other person's point of view. 
Spend time with her and get to the root of all her doubts. Don't cut her off ever, just let her talk and take it all in. Once she's done, if you still disagree with her make sure you don't TELL her why you think she's wrong. Ask her more questions that will lead her to agree with you on her own. 
"You said you're worried that our son will use bitcoin for illegal purposes. Would you feel better if there was a way for us to monitor the money that goes out of his wallet? Do you think something like that would be easier to keep track of as opposed to cash?"
"Let's say despite us having talks with our son and trying to steer him away from drugs, he still decides he wants to buy some. Would you prefer he tried to meet someone in person in a dark location, or if it was all done via the internet at home? Do you think one is more dangerous than the other? If he DID try to have drugs mailed to our home, do you think one of us might be able to intercept the package before he does?"
With questions like these, even if she still doesn't like the idea she will at least be able to understand and respect your point of view. All the while you haven't TOLD her what to think, but rather she's come to her own conclusions.
Sorry for the long comment. Hopefully it's at least a little helpful.

I bought Divcoins as well. Took a handful of dividends while having them listed for about $1.00 more than I paid for them. I lucked out and actually sold the lot for more than I paid, but had I held, I likely would be out money. In my opiniion buying shares in cloud mining isn't really worth it, especially with the difficulty level continually going up. Odds are your divcoins will be worthless before you break even with dividends.

Bitcoin solves a problem. It allows people to send value globally almost instantly without dealing with paper money, banks, fees, etc. So, of course people are interested and adoption is growing.

Well the internet was publicly available in the 91... and I'd say it sucked pretty well into the late 90s (at least as far as speed goes). I'd say Bitcoin is doing pretty well. For a currency that was created only 6 years ago, I've somehow been able to survive this month on it using various solutions. That's a pretty huge step in that short of a timeframe.
I agree though, there are still leaps and bounds to be made. I have no doubt that we will see more in the coming years. I suppose patience is a virtue.

EDIT: Brawker hasn't told me to be quite so extreme (like starving myself, haha). Basically they asked me to pay everything I possibly can, but if I'm absolutely screwed then I can pay through traditional means. Hopefully I can get inventive and make everything work.

I would prefer a system that has people vote solely on the issues as opposed to elected officials. That way the government's job would be to carry out the people's wishes, as opposed to relying on a candidate that could be bribed, or change his/her mind without consulting the voters.

I'll let others chime in, but I'll also let you know a couple of the drawbacks I've noticed.
1. There needs to be a way to edit your posts after the fact. Right now it seems that everything is set in stone, and if you want to change anything about your item, you have to delete it and start from scratch.
2. Despite the fact that all of my transactions have been successful, I still get that "this user seems sketchy" feeling every time. Perhaps that's because of the anonymity of the user profiles. No real information about who you're dealing with.
3. A lot of bids taken by people with no user reviews. I suppose that's part of this being a new service, and that will change with time.
4. My friends who signed up for the site have waited long periods of time for their items to be bought because they themselves don't have any user reviews yet. I think now that I have positive reviews mine get filled much quicker.
5. I didn't realize that if you don't reply to a bid in 24 hours you get a mark against your profile. Not huge, but I wanted that pristine 100% rating.
6. I've had a couple glitches with escrow. One where my ad ran out of time as I was sending the money to escrow and it seemed to be locked there. Another where an item was bought for me, but the site seemed to be stuck waiting for a confirmation of my funds, but there had already been 24. In both occurrences I had it resolved by the site.
7. I think the messaging between users could be improved upon. Right now it seems to be more of a general group chat underneath the listing, whereas I would prefer the ability to send private messages.

While I agree this is a problem to be addressed, I don't believe that every person on there is using a stolen credit card. Turns out I actually know the person who bid on my rent (as I found out this morning).
Different users can be on there for different reasons. Perhaps there are no BTC exchanges in your country. Perhaps you appreciate a certain level of anonymity when obtaining bitcoin. Maybe the hassle of providing multiple forms of government issue ID and bank information to an online exchange to buy at market price is outweighed by the convenience of buying an item on Amazon instead.

So they have roughly the same amount of security, with the only major difference being that QT has to "catch up" to the blockchain every time I turn it on?
I think I get the idea.
Is there any reason someone would PREFER to have QT? Waiting for it to sync with the system seems like a major detractor.

I would have to respectfully disagree. I imagine there was a lot of the same sentiment when people tried explaining the complicated process of sending an email back in the day.

This picture is pretty funny AND incredibly accurate. Other than when I first got started into Bitcoin, I've largely stayed away from alts. However, the slow progress and constant bickering has caused me to "diversify" my crypto investment into the asset suggested in the cartoon. 
Normally this money would have been adding to my HODL pile, but I've instead been hedging my position a bit with our little pick-pocketing friend here. From the looks of the sub over there, many people are doing the same.
I definitely believe there's room for both, but until some major issues are resolved, I think the scales will continue to tip in the same direction.

I think having these guys write a book together is going to be great for giving legitimacy to Bitcoin. Every interview that they've been in has been quite objective, and they've done a good job making other TV personalities open up to the idea, regardless of initial scepticism. Can't wait to read the book, and I hope to see both authors continue to be featured in segments as Bitcoin expands.

Basically you can only hold coins on their website, there are no such thing as third-party apps. They say they are using a blockchain but use buzzwords completely out of context in a way that makes no sense. Also the premise behind the coin is completely in opposition to the basics of supply and demand. They always brag about "doubling the supply of OneCoin" saying that it will double the market cap... but that's not how it works - part of the reason Bitcoin goes up in value is because of the tapering supply. If BTCs were being doubled on a regular basis they would be worth nothing.
They also claim to be the  cryptocurrency in the world next to bitcoin, but aren't listed on any market cap websites other than ones owned by them. Everything about them screams "run away".

I would definitely agree with you. 2MB seems quite reasonable. It gives breathing room to develop new solutions and implement things like Segwit and Lightning. That's not even the most important aspect though. Core going forward with 2MB would basically take the wind out of every other implementation's sails and reunite a currently fractured community. It may not be the easiest thing to implement, but I feel like that small compromise would allow us to all finally put aside our differences and hold hands/sing Kumbaya.

Anonymity through Coinbase is actually not possible. You provide them your banking details in order to purchase, and when you send the coins out of your account the transactions can be traced. 
If you're looking for anonymous buys, you'll likely have to hit a Bitcoin ATM or check out localbitcoins.com. You can also buy through paxful.com. Any of these options will cost a little bit above market value, and be less convenient than Coinbase. Sucks, but currently that's the trade-off. Hopefully as the ecosystem grows we'll continue to see more options at better price points.

I used Fold for the first time this morning and I was blown away. Super easy to use, can do it on the spot/no pre-planning involved. Not to mention you don't even have to buy a full gift card, and you can get your change back in bitcoin immediately. This is finally a service where I can see myself using bitcoin regularly.

No, as soon as you make your purchase, there's a refund button with an area to paste the bitcoin address of your choice. It's great because I always hated having cards with spare change on them.
Basically you buy $5, $10 or $25, make your purchase, then get your change sent back to you immediately.
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:06:29
I think this is a great idea. This runs parallel with giving away free Bitcoin. If it's free then it implies there's no value. You wouldn't give someone $5 USD to "try it out". 
I occasionally host meet ups in Calgary, and soon Red Deer. Perhaps I'll try this approach and see how it fares. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:19:26
To tell you the truth I'm not sure what the solution is. Right now it's looking like a stalemate. I very much doubt BU will get the 80% they want in order to split. Maybe they'll split with half the hash power, and if they do I would imagine that they end up being the minority chain, which could then pave the way for Segwit passing since most of those blocking it now will have moved on.
If none of that comes to pass, we may end up with BTC as a digital gold, while major exchanges and wallet services create lightning networks between themselves to help facilitate faster settlement. Even as a digital gold, Bitcoin will be MUCH better than the monetary system we currently have.

I tweeted them the other day and got a response pretty quickly. It would seem there's been a huge increase in demand, and they're having trouble keeping up. They said their team is working to keep them stocked to the best of their ability. I imagine it's difficult if they've got limited capital and constantly need to be converting back into fiat in order to obtain more gift cards. I'm actually surprised these guys haven't been affected more by transaction malleability since they accept 0 confirmations. 
Great service when it's working though! I used them today.

Looking at the FAQ on Core's website was actually hugely helpful and informative. I've been on the fence with this whole debate, but it really cleared a lot of things up for me.
I would agree that I'd like to see what they have planned as far as hard forks go. Denouncing the censorship would also be a hugely beneficial statement when it comes to unifying the community. Here's hoping this open conversation that they've started begins the process of calming everyone down and getting rid of bad blood so we can once again work together towards a common goal.

The gradual accumulation long-game has been my approach and it has served me well. I started right before Gox at around $800, but continued buying after that because I knew the fundamentals behind bitcoin were still in place. In the past 2+ years my money has quadrupled. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows though... there were points where I was down by half. 
I was never very good at putting money away for later until bitcoin. I used to spend it all on eating out, buying shit online, etc. I suppose I've just reallocated where those wasted funds were going into something with more potential. As long as you're not starving yourself and you have a bit of extra cash, then I think your approach is a good one.

I used to read all of the TA articles from this site, but recently they started getting their charts from a new exchange that is sponsoring the website. That wouldn't be a big deal, but SimpleFX seems to be consistently sitting $10-$15 higher than the exchanges I usually look at (Bitfinex &amp; Bitstamp). Essentially this renders the articles useless unless you trade on or watch SimpleFX charts. 
Anyone have suggestions for other sites that offer similar articles but use charts that are a more accurate representation of the current price?

Miners will still exist, but their function will be to confirm transactions, with the incentive being the transaction fees. At that point maybe the term "miner" won't make sense, but they will still be there.
@_date: 2016-06-01 05:21:48
I just mean that you need to have bitcoin for people to buy through your machine. If you don't have the machine stocked and you're always running out then people will get frustrated and stop using it.

I would say it depends on if you plan on selling pretty quick after the halving, or if you're going to be holding for an extended period of time. 
If you want to sell for a quick buck... I would be cautious. Bitcoin is unpredictable. If you're going to hold for years to come, then I would say you're fine. Even if the price drops, dollar cost averaging will be your friend.
@_date: 2016-06-14 22:38:13
You get what you pay for! The now bust Skyhook machines were affordable but unreliable. Lamassu is pricey, but well worth the money. Great customer service and tech help. 
Keep in mind you also have to stock the machine with bitcoin, so that is an additional expense. 
I would first work on finding a location that would let you place an atm there. Central to town will get you the most traffic.
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:56:33
I've been using paper wallets for some time now, and at this point I trust them after getting used to the process. I just got a KeepKey last week and I'm getting familiar with it. I'd say I'm just about ready to place a substantial amount of my holdings in it, now that I'm becoming familiar with it. I haven't used a Trezor yet, but that's next on the list.
I've also tried the NFC Ledger wallet with Mycelium, but I didn't find it very reliable. The NFC itself would take multiple times to scan, and was a huge pain in the ass. I imagine the ledger nano would be much better, since it actually plugs into your device.
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:22:10
Yes. I'll put in a good word ;)
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:51:23
I think you're right at the moment, but I feel like it will become both a store of value and a currency as new layers are added. In order to become a stable currency it will have to grow a lot and have a massive market cap so that it's less subject to volatility. If that is achieved in the coming years then I see no reason why it couldn't be used in every day transactions with the help of something like lightning. OR perhaps we'll have other currencies built on top of the bitcoin blockchain that we use regularly?
@_date: 2019-11-06 04:53:08
Apologies if it came off defensive. I thought the "super pathetic" part was in reference to us for even getting it made.
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:57:49
I'm imagining consumers with digital wallets holding both fiat and bitcoin, slowly watching the values diverge as their government continues to devalue their local currency. I wonder how many lightbulbs would go off at that point, as people witness the effects of monetary policy live on their phones? I'd be ShapeShifting the shit out of my CADcoin pretty quick.

I do some work clearing out a few bitcoin atms in my city. Same size population of 1 million. I can say that they are quite busy, and the volume only seems to be increasing. Depending on the percentage fee you charge, you could definitely make your money back in less than a year. 
One thing to take into account... You also have to buy enough bitcoin to stock the hot wallet for the atm, and you may need a fair bit. Once people realize it's there, you'd be surprised how quickly you sell out.
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:43:36
To tell you the truth I've seen people pump that much into the machine in one visit. 
I would say that most importantly you need an easy way to get your hands on bitcoin quickly. If you're able to find someone who is mining then they could sell you coins potentially at a discount, or at the regular market rate so that you don't cut into your profits. 
There are a lot of factors to consider, but if you have a really good location then you may be needing to buy more bitcoin once or twice a week.
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:46:35

Verification depends on where you live. In Canada you literally scan your QR, insert bills and receive bitcoin. I've heard in the US you need to provide ID and even hand prints in some cases? That's crazy to me.
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:50:04
This is also how I started. The fees are a tad high, but that's what you pay for instant/anonymous. There are also limits on how much you buy each day from your ip address. 
For higher limits I recommend QuadrigaCX, if you don't mind signing up.

@_date: 2016-06-29 20:12:45
Depends on your viewpoint. If I understand correctly, the people behind breadwallet are advocating for KYC/AML at the protocol level, whereas Bitpay implements it only through their own services. That could be enough of a distinction for some people to prefer one over the other.

I bought at 800 before gox. I also bought at 200 last January, and continually during 2015  when the price was down. Investment is now worth almost 3x.

Miners were able to mine last year when bitcoin was $200 so I think they're currently fine. 
As far as transaction fees go, I think it would be the case that by then many more people are using the network, and all those fees would add up to quite a decent sized reward.
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:12:53

I recently did a video talking about exactly this. The denominations can be a tad confusing at first, but hopefully this will give you some insight into how things work.
@_date: 2016-11-15 04:42:09
Agreed. This is by far not the best solution out there, but I like your travel analogy. I'm from Canada, and having a USD and GBP credit card is going to save me a bundle in cross border fees. If they had options for other countries in Southeast Asia, I would have literally saved hundreds, if not a couple grand, over the 5 month trip I'm about to wrap up.
The remittance angle is a good one too. If they had a card denominated in Phillipino Pesos, people working abroad could buy bitcoin and directly fund the card for their family to take out cash at home. 
I'm sure there are other use cases that I haven't thought of, but overall it's another cool implementation that never would have been possible a few years ago.

I agree in a sense... but if their users were still ok with using Bitcoin for what it currently is, it seems silly to remove that functionality. I don't know the numbers, but it looks like their move upset enough of their users to result in a crappy rating on their app.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:02:17
I'm curious what percentage of their business was strictly from Bitcoin users, and how many new users they had coming in to strictly use their money-sending service. It seemed a little counterintuitive to alienate the core users that you initially based your entire platform on.

Thanks buddy! Glad you found it helpful :)
@_date: 2016-11-03 09:21:48
That's not how it works. You have to run a server and an API that will sent out the BTCs for you. Bitcoin is stocked in a hot wallet, because you need to be able to sent the bitcoin out instantly. Users won't wait around for you to execute buy orders on exchanges, move the money off the exchange (which can take upwards of an hour), then send to their address.
In order to keep the experience quick &amp; convenient above all else, you have to pre-stock the hot-wallet and set up alerts for when it runs low so you can replenish it quickly. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 05:38:19
Yup, lots of bitcoin ATMs are around 5-7%. Not really ideal, but the machines cost around $10,000 and then you have to stock them with bitcoin/expose yourself to volatility. Owners likely need a high margins to make up for the risks.

There was an Andreas talk where he put forth a theoretical situation. Guy owns self driving cars that are essentially an uber service. Guy dies with no will. Cars still go out the next morning, take their own payments, buy their own fuel, etc. 
That or perhaps we get a philanthropist who just buys some self driving cars for poorer areas, and programs them to take the minimum payment to cover costs, so as to provide cheap transportation for those in need.

@_date: 2016-11-15 04:37:59
Ok so clearly you feel strongly about this, but peppering your reply with angry insults doesn't help convince people of your reasoning. If you tell someone they spent time creating "shit", how inclined do you think that person is to listen to you with an open mind?
As far as your reference to people's rights of freedom and privacy - I agree. Everyone should have a right to choose what they keep private and public. In this case I've personally chosen that providing my name and email address was ok. I wasn't forced to. Had they asked for my social security  passport, ID scan or any of that information I would likely have been more hesitant to provide that. As bitcoin improves anonymity and more services pop up, I imagine people will have more choice as to the amount of information (if any) they choose to share.
Your point is valid, but I would encourage you to word your concerns in a non-confrontational way. If you do, then you may find that MANY more people will hear you out instead of arguing back. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 08:18:59
No withdrawal fee. I believe their fee is worked into the spread when you convert bitcoin to fiat and vice versa. In my tests it seemed to vary depending on how volatile the market price was at the time, but they list their buy and sell prices in the app and on the site as you use it. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 15:15:16
I'm working on mine! Should be up on Monday :)
@_date: 2016-12-03 04:47:37
Did any of the people working on it expect it to be approved that quickly? From what I've heard it would take quite some time for participating miners to make the necessary changes.
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:57:13
This is true, but my experience with it was subpar. Had issues getting the nfc to work. You have to maintain connection to the card while you use it (which fails more than half the time) and you still have to go through and pull out your security reference card for every transaction as well. Ledger has some great products, but I would wait for another iteration of this one.
@_date: 2016-11-03 09:23:23
This works out well when the price is rising, but you can see how it would hurt when you've just stocked your atm and the price takes a $100 nosedive. 2014 would have been rough if you owned an ATM.

I spent 4 weeks there, so I had lots of time for both :)
That being said, I agree that bitcoin currently needs to be "hunted for". It's still super cool when you see it though. I've been looking for BTC friendly spots this past 4 months on the road and I've found it in 8 out of 9 countries I've visited. Whenever I come across it, the people are super passionate about what they're doing, which leads me to believe that a few years down the road you won't need to do nearly as much hunting.
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:20:17

On my trip I brought a bitcoin visa card as a backup. It actually came in handy a couple of times when transactions got flagged. I've tried out ones from Bitwala and Wirex, which are both pretty reliable, especially you're in a bind. I even get notifications on my phone every time I spend with the Bitwala card, so if anyone was using it without my knowledge I could quickly go and block it myself in the app.
Worth looking into for your next trip. Hope the info helps!

Wait, perhaps someone can clarify something for me. Does ViaBTC oppose Segwit because of the worry of a monopoly with core and Blockstream centralizing power in a conspiracy-esque way? I know this is the view of some people in the big block camp, but am unsure if ViaBTC holds these views as well. I would find it very hypocritical if they were aligned with this way of thinking, then offered a centralized way of speeding transactions through them.

@_date: 2016-11-15 09:26:14
I looked into this further, and didn't notice anywhere near this kind of a spread using the card. I've also found another review here, and they report the same. There's a minimal variance in exchange rate, depending on which exchange you get your prices from. Since you're converting btc in your wirex wallet into a fiat denominated card, it appears as if this spread is negligible. If you find further information and sources to the contrary, I would very much be interested in hearing it though. I would do an add-on or follow up video if that was the case. 
Here's a review that I also found from CoinGecko. Seems to share some of the thoughts that I had.
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:47:48
I think this is a great point. I know that things can get heated, but the fact that there's even a conversation going on about how our money should work is fantastic. On top of that, the very notion that we can now choose which currency we'd like to use is ground-breaking. For all the FUD and infighting, I think it's important to realize that Bitcoin (and crypto as a whole) has already accomplished something pretty incredible.

I'm confused where you see these fees? The fee table shows costs for initially getting the card, but then no fees for regular transactions. You get dinged if you use ATMs or buy something in a different currency than the card is denominated it, but I mentioned that.
Is there something other than that which I've missed?

I feel like your speculation here might have a couple flaws. 
Bitcoin price has only ever been higher than what it is now for a few weeks in history. There was a huge mania then, and price started to tumble on news of China's "ban", then seemed to be compounded by Mt Gox and the worry/misinformation surrounding it. 
Also back then I would argue that the scaling issue wasn't a blip on anyone's radar that would have been affecting price. If that was the case then we might have expected to see the price continue to plummet through the rest of 2015-2016 as the debate intensified, rather than the up trend we've enjoyed for the past year and a half. 
I'm not denying that the speed of scaling hasn't discouraged some, but I don't think it is the main cause of the price plummet between Dec 2013 - Jan 2015. I also think that this may just be the cost of decentralization. Changes are purposely extremely difficult to implement and only take place with consensus. We may be scaling slower than most would prefer, but we also haven't been turned into a permissioned system like PayPal.

I think it's more the idea of remaining well composed while presenting the facts. Anger comes off as defensive, and can detract from your position, regardless of how correct you may be.
For instance look at your response to this person's comment. Do you think you've convinced them of your argument, or possibly made them more likely to listen to the other side? My guess would be the latter.

I would respectfully disagree. I love bitcoin, and will be ecstatic every time I can use it at a new location directly... But I also have day to day things that I buy from brick and mortar stores. If I can use bitcoin through proxy with one of these cards, then great. 
Also this kind of thing saves me money when I travel in the US, UK and Europe every time I make a purchase (though not so much when I use an atm). A physical card that can be topped up instantly on the go is huge for me. I can't shop exclusively online when I change locations every 3-5 days.
I appreciate that you'd prefer to only use your BTC wallet, but until I can just pay with BTC everywhere, these gap-bridging services are massively helpful to me on the road, and I will continue to use them.  To each their own.

FYI Canada it's super easy. See my post above. It may have been difficult in the past, but since I started accumulating BTC in March 2014, it's been a breeze.

Glad to see someone doing more than a simple google search to get their info. If you are still looking for a solid understanding of the technology, I highly recommend checking out any talks by Andreas Antonopoulos. He has a fantastic way of being very articulate when speaking on the subject.
Right now the block size debate is huge. People are basically able to vote how they want the system to work based on which version of the software they choose to run. Very interesting and could make a cool piece if you contrast it to the current monetary system where ordinary people have no say in how their money works.
Overstock implementing blockchain tech in stock trading is another one to check out. They announced a platform called T/0 (that's a zero) recently that would be completely transparent and do away with a lot of the rigging that happens on Wall Street.
There's plenty of other stuff going on too. 1000 Bitcoin ATMs going to Greece, interesting new startups popping up every day, huge amounts of VC money going to new tech, etc. 
I would encourage you to get a solid understanding of the technology as you go along so you can avoid confusing the general public with inaccuracies. Hope your pieces turn out well!

I feel like I still need some clarification on the mining process. It's the one part of bitcoin that still is not nailed down in my brain.
So all transactions over the past 10 minutes are blocked together. Miners are verifying those transactions, correct? My confusion comes with the lottery system and where the number the miners are competing to guess comes from. Can anyone explain it somewhat simply to me?
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:16:38
That's what I'm using it for though so... I guess I'm doing it wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-22 21:20:15
That's in line with what I've been doing for the past year and a half now. While I did indeed buy in the $800 range, with the low price all year it's averaged out for me to currently be at a breakeven. 
There's a very real possibility that if you throw a couple hundred bucks into bitcoin you could see that cut in half. However, there's also a good possibility that you see another bubble-style increase as well. The reason I've continued to buy (other than supporting a technology I believe in) is that I consider the potential upside to far outweigh the potential downside.
I hope everything goes well for you! Just remember to keep your bitcoin safe and try not to leave your funds in online exchanges.
@_date: 2015-08-10 21:03:36
Very cool to see. Excited to keep following this project.
If this were to become more popular down the road, I feel like it may benefit you guys to play around with the wording an imagery in your videos. I understand dark markets, but to someone unfamiliar that may come off as shady and illegal.

People can be pretty irrational. They don't realize that not everyone spends every day reading every piece of information available on the topic. There's so much to take in at first. 
It's honestly just refreshing to see people actually looking into the subject a little deeper than reading a headline and running with it. I've noticed the media has been opening up to everything lately and actually considering the ramifications of the technology.
Biggest thing I've noticed lately is everyone referring to blockchain technology and trying to separate it from bitcoin... not realizing that they are one and the same. That can be annoying.

Timing the market is extremely difficult. Dollar cost averaging is your friend. As long as you are using money you can afford to lose, decide on a specific amount that you will put aside every week, month, or couple of months. Don't deviate from your plan because then you are susceptible to making emotional buys and sells. 
Everyone knows it's better to buy low and sell high... But in practice very few are able to actually do this. Give yourself rules according to your current finances and stick to them.
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:20:16
That's not correct. You get a dollar voucher that instant converts into a newly created wallet that you hold the keys to at the time of redemption. If you watch the video it literally sends an on chain transaction at the moment you scan and hit redeem. You can even bypass the native wallet in the app and redeem into an external wallet or lightning wallet.
Did you watch the video at all?
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:18:45
Very good point. Even with full mainstream adoption I think there will be local fiat for a LONG time because of that. We would just see a lot more people holding value in BTC until making purchases denominated in fiat. 
Another issue would be wages for workers. If you were to set an employee's wage in Bitcoin at current prices and we saw a rise even just to the previous high, the employer would be stuck with workers he could no longer afford. Even when your money is worth more, an employee would not be to keen on seeing their wages cut over time to keep up with deflation. 
Basically deflation would be great if you're holding, but awful if you have debt. Makes sense why the US hates deflation considering the size of the national debt.

The last people to accept fiat will be government, I imagine. They would like to prop up their currency by forcing people to pay their taxes with it, no?
The potential deflation of bitcoin in comparison to regular inflation right now is astronomical. A return to the previous high would be a 4X increase in worker's wages, which we've seen is possible over the course of only a couple months (2013). That's gonna be a tough transition for nearly every company on earth at the moment, since they all deal with fiat currently. Not that it can't ever happen... it will just take time.
I agree that this culture of debt will be drastically changed because of Bitcoin. Excessive amounts of household debt would no longer be necessary if your money gained value over time. Very true.
The US government favours inflation because printing more money to pay off debt and devaluing your own currency makes things a lot more manageable. Monetary deflation would imply that there's a lower supply of fiat, or an inability to print away debt at will. I think we're saying the same thing, because I agree with you. 
On most of these points I see where you're coming from, and feel like my original post was already in agreement with your views. Looking at your old posts, it would seem you just enjoy picking apart people's words. I think you might enjoy more success in your conversations if you were a tad less confrontational.

I was the guy that was sponsored by them to live on Bitcoin for a month. While everyone was quite friendly and supportive in my correspondence with them, there was a LOT of employee turnover. In one month I believe 4 people I was emailing back and forth with told me that they were no longer with the company, and passed me onto the next.

I think you mean hyperinflation. The US doesn't have that (at least not now). 
And that's my point... If the value of BTC is higher then people spend less to get the same services, meaning that workers technically should get less for the same work. Regardless of the fact that money is worth more, there's still the idea of sticky wages. That means psychologically people would be less understanding if their wages were cut even though the money they're getting paid is technically worth the same. The numerical number of bits someone receives would matter in their mind, regardless of how much they can buy with it. 
I suppose a way around this would be implementing wages that fluctuate with the cost of living.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:44:07

@_date: 2015-07-15 15:27:41
How did this come about? Did you try to withdraw your money when they announced the exchange was shutting down? Did you do it before their cutoff?
I sympathize and definitely think they should have had a lengthier withdrawal period of maybe a year. I really hope that you get your BTC back.
I also hope that this serves as another reminder to the community that no large amount of bitcoin should be left on ANY exchange... reputable or not. While regulation is being implemented, it is still very much the wild west of virtual finance right now, and a lot of these startup exchanges come and go quite quickly.

I would disagree. He spoke to the Canadian Senate a while back and they've just released their stance on crypto. In short, because of his testimony they are taking a "hands-off" approach and letting this fantastic new technology flourish. I'd say he's helping the ecosystem however he can. 
I imagine it would be tough for anyone who has been around since the early days not to accidentally get tied up with some bad actors. Roger Ver got involved with Mt Gox. It's not like he was a "parasite" for doing so. He was unaware of what was going on behind the scenes.

If you want to gift Bitcoin to someone, have the dollar value remain the same until redemption (instead of having it fluctuate if you create a paper wallet) and the app holds their hand through everything.
Fees vary (I have a section in the video about this). For the largest card of $250 the fee ends up being just below 4%. These cover their overhead (creating/stocking store shelves with cards, on-chain tx fee, plus ensuring the company makes a profit/continues to operate).

The concept is great. I've just taken a look at the actual site and encountered a few problems/have a few suggestions.
I signed up but keep getting logged out/getting error messages when trying to log in. 
Is there any sort of search function, or categories to separate the videos? I realize there's not a lot of content up yet, but it would be helpful. I'm unsure if there's anything more to watch than the 8 videos on the landing page, and I don't see any other navigation.
I definitely think there should be a rating system implemented eventually. My first thought when I went to the site was "This is a great idea... but I don't want to chance paying to view a crappy video." If an avid bitcoiner has that initial thought, it will be tough to get newbies to pay for content they know nothing about down the road unless other users have vouched for the quality of the upload. Just a thought!
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:45:58
I'm curious as to how difficult it is in the US. What kind of steps do you have to go through? Does it not work all the time?
I live in Canada and I've found it exceedingly easy, even with exchanges shutting down and new ones starting up. I used to be on Vault of Satoshi, but since that one closed I've been using Cointrader and Quadriga. For all of those I signed up and had to provide a photo ID/picture of myself holding that ID. It took a day or two for confirmation to come through. Now that I'm set up I can fund my account in less than a minute with Interac Online, make a purchase, and send my BTC to a personal wallet almost immediately.
On top of that, before I signed up for an exchange I was able to use QuickBT.com for small purchases each day of around 0.2 BTC with no sign up info required, again using Interac Online. 
Besides those options, I now have 5 Bitcoin ATMs in the city that I can put up to a limit of $3000 cash daily and only verify with a cell phone number.
I realize that things are a little different regulatory-wise in the US so I'd love to have someone explain to me what kind of roadblocks consumers and businesses face down there in contrast.

I've heard people saying they should wait for upwards of 30 confirmations to make sure your transactions are valid, but I don't know if that applies when you're using mycelium? Could my transaction have been on the forked chain, and therefore cancelled?

I also wonder if deflation might drive a new spin to the economy. Could it be possible that people would want to sell their assets more frequently instead of holding them, if the value of currency increases at a rate quicker than the asset itself?

As someone already familiar with bitcoin I enjoyed this piece. However I worry that with all the focus on drugs, gambling and hackers (which seem to be a large part of the piece), any newcomers will have their preconceived notions confirmed that bitcoin is just some shady tech for criminals.

Yes, but hitting the wall of how many transistors can be fit on a chip will force research into newer innovations, creating a new explosion of technological advances. Remember, before we used transistors we were using vacuum tubes.

I think he didn't highlight the fact that the problem isn't with eventual bigger blocks, but rather with "emergent consensus" and the worry that BU's implementation could lead to big problems. There IS a block size increase in core's roadmap currently - but that (like segwit) is dependent on the consensus of the community. 
As far as LN is concerned, it lowers the barrier to entry for regular people to contribute to the network AND be rewarded. If you wanted, you could run a lightning node, put up some BTC, and make money on transaction fees. It decentralizes things a bit more. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:27:59

Yeah I don't think virtual dates would be the norm (though it may be good for long distance relationships). Virtual stores don't seem that far off though.

In the second case I would agree with you. However in the case of people who perhaps don't understand everything and the implications of it all, I would argue it is worth taking the time to help them fully grasp what's going on. 
Most people don't want to be told they're wrong, but if you're really good with words then you can lead them to the truth while allowing them to save face. It's embarrassing realizing your beliefs may have been incorrect, let alone admitting it to others.

I can't say I've ever seen someone pump more than 9 grand into a machine in one go, but I know it happens sometimes. The verification can also vary depending on the machine. I think there are a couple in town that are essentially unlimited with no verification at all. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 04:02:22
Most credit card processors charge 2-3% so it's actually a pretty good deal to accept through Bitpay in comparison. I'd consider it worth it for the easy accounting, record keeping and diving up tips built into the app. That being said, if there is a free wallet created that can do these things and you're looking to keep the BTC, then that would be a better alternative. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:50:26
That's fine, but shouldn't people just judge the code itself? What were the main goals/concerns here? Fix malleability, allow for scaling, and avoid a hard fork... Is this correct?
If these things can be accomplished safely, does it really matter if "the other side" is happy as well? 
I'll hold judgement until the code is audited by the community, but this looks fantastic if it ends up working.
@_date: 2016-02-21 20:55:29
I think he means globally. Yes the US made a blunder there, but if it stays that way then companies will move mining operations to other countries to avoid unreasonable regulations. Companies do this to avoid excessive taxation in the US all the time.

Yup, CAD. It's definitely pretty nice to have it available. There are actually 15 Bitcoin ATMs in my city currently. Most have the same general restrictions, but a couple are basically unlimited with no verification required. The only limit would be how much is sitting in the ATM hot wallet.

@_date: 2017-04-17 17:12:55
A friend of mine knows the owner and so we kind of came across each other through the grapevine. I know that he gets a small cut of the Bitcoin ATM profits, and it was a natural transition for him to start accepting it in-store.
It can still be a tough sell to a lot of people, but it's growing quite a bit - especially in my city. There are something like 15 ATMs in town now, from 3 different companies.

I agree that things could have been stated better on the first point.
For the second point I think I was perhaps unclear. Users that do not run nodes would still get the benefits of the lightning network if their wallet providers switch to lightning transactions as well. Lightning would be exponentially cheaper than first-layer bitcoin transactions. Lightning is still Bitcoin, and it is cryptographically provable. That's a big misconception in some cases. It's a little difficult to explain, but every transaction is locked to actual bitcoin, but it would be sort of a mesh of payment channels that would link together everyone. It minimizes the number of layer-1 bitcoin settlements that have to be done. Here's an example:
There are 3 people: You, Alice and Bob. 
You owe Alice $7 and Bob $3. Bob also owes Alice $3.
Instead of 3 transactions (you paying Bob, you paying Alice, and Bob paying Alice) you would make one transaction paying Alice $10. This pays off your and Bob's debt in 1 go, getting rid of 2 needless transactions. You still pay $10 total, and Bob has to do nothing. In fact, you two don't transact at all. This reduces transaction costs by 2/3 in this one example.
Now imagine this with millions of people and businesses all connected. It would hugely reduce the number of on-chain transactions needed, but it would all still be linked to real bitcoin - you're just figuring out how many Bitcoin transactions you actually NEED in order to get everyone their money.
Having something like this will exponentially increase the number of users that Bitcoin can handle, which will ensure there is still demand for on-chain transactions at the base layer. The idea is that the majority of the community uses this second layer, while the high fees of the first layer are covered by those running lightning nodes/collecting large numbers of tiny fee transactions.

I could be wrong, but I think you would need longer block times OR you would have to wait for more confirmations  because of the length of time it takes transmissions to get to/from Mars. It looks like radio transmissions would take between 4-24 minutes (one way), depending on the time of year. You could be double-spent an not realize it if you didn't wait long enough.

If you print out a paper wallet there will be 2 QR codes. One is public and safe for anyone to see (which is the QR code any mobile app would use when receiving couns). The other is your private key, that gives you (or anyone) permission to spend the funds. To show this private QR code in a mobile app, most wallets require you to go through the advanced settings and will offer you a warning to keep it hidden in the process.

I did a video on my experience with Bitwala. If you're going to just play around with it, then it's worth a try. For day to day transactions it will be a little too pricey unless you don't care about throwing away money.

I'm a fan of Copay because of the simplicity of it, but I also like Mycelium on Android (not iOS though). If you're into alts then Jaxx is worth a look as well. You can hold bitcoin and a few different cryptos in the same wallet.

2.5 years ago my only option for a wallet was to download Core on my laptop. It took two days to sync before I could use it, and every time I opened it I would have to wait a while for it to catch up and download the latest transactions. There were no iPhone options because the few existing bitcoin apps were banned from the app store. 
Today both iOS and Android have a ton of mobile wallets available, and I have access to affordable hardware wallets for additional security. Many hardware solutions work with both mobile and desktop. 
Two years ago it was difficult for me to access an online exchange. Now I have many choices available to me. Even in the US with what some would consider excessive regulation, there are some great options with Coinbase, Circe, Gemini, etc. Many places also offer Bitcoin debit cards, which I believe didn't exist in early 2014.
Two years ago all my friends thought I was some sort of crackpot for putting any money into bitcoin. Today I regularly get messages from people asking me to explain bitcoin, and a number of my friends/family are holding at least a few millibits. 
On the surface it often can seem like technology is moving at a snail's pace. It's not until you look back that you realize just how much innovation is happening.

The app is meant to address the lack of a screen. It pairs with the device and will cross-check the address on your computer is correct. The pairing is done via QR code during initial setup, much like Google Authenticator.
I'm unsure the difference between storing a piece of paper vs an SD card in a fireproof safe. Would they both not be protected?
Not trying to be dismissive of your concerns, just looking for clarity. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:57:50
Yes and no. If someone is looking for a cheap alternative then this will do the trick. Setup is easy, form factor is nice and small, native app does what it need to do. Could use segwit, easier backup recovery and a "send all" function, along with being able to designate your native currency.

I don't know how I feel about Mike Tyson branded BTMs. It doesn't exactly scream "legitimate" to new users.

That's a really cool idea actually. I'll have to look into something like that.
If this one goes well then we might do a similar event but also feature some local dance crews. There are some great b-boys in the city.

I was worried clicking on the link, but was stoked to hear "NICE."
Best comment ever.
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:44:35
Hmmm sounds like the app itself is being glitchy then. I seem to remember having an issue the first time I used it, but I uninstalled/reinstalled and everything worked fine.
@_date: 2015-09-28 16:37:17
Thanks! I found Copay to be the easiest possible setup for new users. It's great for introducing someone to bitcoin and getting them started within seconds :) 
I'd love to chat more about the show and using Copay with the audience.
@_date: 2015-09-15 04:55:59
This is actually similar to what we're thinking of doing! Great minds think alike :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:11:53
Yup, also got this. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:59:53
I should clarify - I think the method of signing transactions without physically connecting to anything is more secure. However the fact that it's not open source makes that point moot. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 01:41:36
Atm withdrawals are $10usd. Add a shitty exchange rate, plus another $5cad from my bank at home.

Hey man, I love this post. I was wondering if it would be alright for me to use your quote in an upcoming video I'm making? In my spare time I do a beginner's guide to bitcoin called [BTC Sessions]( and the title of your post really struck a chord with me that I think will resonate with a lot of people on the fence regarding digital currency. 
Let me know if you're cool with it, and if you'd like me to credit you by your handle, or use a real name.
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:06:54
OMG where can I get one of these?
@_date: 2016-10-29 08:35:23
You have to remember that not everyone knows a lot about investing and stocks, let alone bitcoin. It's better to legitimately answer these kinds of questions than mock them. At some point or another everyone here was "just learning". 
@_date: 2015-09-14 17:52:34
That's actually pretty awesome. I think we've got a photographer lined up for the event, so I should let him know about this!
@_date: 2016-10-22 03:34:59
It's actually been pretty horrendous this whole trip. Even in Thailand charges 200baht for a withdrawal (around $8CAD), plus the crappy conversion fee that rips you off by a few percent, plus whatever fee pops up in my bank account at home. I've spent hundreds this trip taking out money. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 01:33:47
Haha I know, right? I also had a friend say "Yeah, but there's no way anyone getting in NOW would see the kind of returns you have." I didn't even buy my first bitcoins until 2014.
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:40:45
Is this an underhanded comment about what I look like? 
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:22:48
That's true, but it also allows for the implementation of lightning, which can handle exponentially more transactions. That's why people are excited.
@_date: 2016-10-31 17:15:23
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:38:08
Yeah the anchor was actually quite excited to talk about it! He asked if I'd come back whenever there's major news :)
@_date: 2016-10-25 01:37:19
I think it'll take quite a while before anything is settled on. If we had to choose right at this moment then I think millibits would be the easiest for everyday people to comprehend. 1.5 millibits for a buck. 
Bits will be most useful if the price really skyrockets into the thousands/tens of thousands.

@_date: 2016-10-06 03:03:55
Wait... Can you further clarify something? Does this mean that channels between two specific parties are not necessarily needed, but rather channels between nodes on the network? Would this in turn mean that a channel open between each of the 5000 or so nodes on the network would scale transactions exponentially?
I may be understanding things incorrectly. I'm not a super technical person.

Thanks for the info. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2016-10-14 08:18:15
That's fantastic. It's actually easy to understand what I'm paying. Think you might implement CAD$ anytime soon? Regulation-wise the government has decided to let the ecosystem grown on its own. We've also got a great community up north, with one of the highest bitcoin atm ratios in relation to the population. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:14:25
Weird, the interface on that unit is completely different from the newer one they sent over. Definitely didn't get an android startup screen on mine at any point, but good catch.
So your main concern is that the device could be tampered with/rooted before a consumer gets their hands on it?
@_date: 2016-10-09 22:39:50
I had a similar idea when I initially got into bitcoin as well. Time and time again it always proved to be much more profitable to just hold my coins with (maybe) the exception of one. Putting money into buying a bitcoin ATM can turn a decent profit if you're able to get a good location. Even still, the money I've put in that is about on par with hodling. 
Things to avoid: 
A lot of cloud mining investments are pretty scammy. 
The concept of BTC lending services in return for interest is great, but right now there is no reliable way to establish risk, and a huge number of borrowers just default. 
Steer clear of Havelock investments. It's an easy way to watch your coins erode in value unless you get lucky with your timing. 
I hope this helps!
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:47:54
Also I don't think this thing is running android.

I enjoy the video and agree with a lot of his ideas. The way the video is shot makes me cringe a bit though. 
"Gather 'round children. Old man Maloney wants to read you a story" - Said while sipping his class of wine as the candle-lit room flickers in the background.
One thing I'm happy to see is the separation between his informative videos and the plugs for his gold buying services. Having an ad at the end of the video would have taken away from the message.

I was pretty surprised when I listened to this podcast. I mean... There's so many interesting new innovations happening but they seem completely disillusioned. Meanwhile I'm sitting here super excited.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:50:13
There are no updates because the device never connects to the internet at all. Transactions are signed on the device and represented as a QR code, so the private key never leaves the device. You broadcast the transaction by scanning the qr with your actual smartphone. 
The major unknown here is the private key generation. Since the device is not open source you can't be 100% sure that the keys weren't previously generated and then subsequently loaded onto the device before shipping. That would be my biggest worry, and why I wouldn't necessarily use this for any meaningful amount of crypto. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:00:08
Ditto! Pass me a handful of that popcorn!
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:20:41

I am beyond excited for this. If it works well, then it becomes realistic for me to start receiving part of my paycheque in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:28:14
Could be a slow connection. The blockchain is quite large to download for the first time. If bitcoin unlimited were to become the dominant implementation then this sync delay you're experiencing could become quite a bit longer very quickly.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:00:46
Agreed, this definitely isn't cost efficient, and the fact that it's not open source is a major sticking point. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:17:22
What exchange did you see this on? I follow Quad's price, but it hasn't QUITE hit 2000 yet. 
@_date: 2016-10-08 01:36:18
Looks like it will, but there's a conversion fee of 3%, which is the same with a lot of Bitcoin Visa options. Hopefully they add CAD support soon so we don't have to deal with that.
@_date: 2015-11-26 00:25:51
This is fantastic! I remember tweeting him back in the day asking if he'd accept Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2016-05-14 14:57:02
As long as you're only spending money you can afford to lose, then yes I would say this is a safe approach. Currently 25 new bitcoins are created every 10 minutes, and there is enough demand to keep the price stable/slowly tick upwards. This summer production gets cut in half to 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes. Assuming demand stays the same, we would have to see a price increase in the months following this halving. 
Some may say the market has already priced this in because people are anticipating it, but I have my doubts about that.
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:02:45
Haha well thanks for the flattery. We weren't sure how it would turn out, but it went better than expected. Hopefully next one is even bigger!

@_date: 2016-05-31 12:54:31
While those figures are a tad arbitrary, I wouldn't say that someone is "fucking nuts" for suggesting them. At one point the idea of bitcoin reaching dollar parity seemed unattainable as well.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:47:08
That's the thing though - you don't ever plug it into a computer. You charge it on the wall. It is never connected to another device, and it has no way of accessing the internet. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:15:12
Unfortunately not yet - and I believe that has something to do with the patents surrounding NFC payments. I think either Mastercard or Visa have control of that, which is why every mobile wallet could easily implement it, if not for the legal ramifications. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:43:00
Thanks for letting me know! Fixed :)
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:52:16

In my older video about Wirex they charge for getting the card itself, and for taking out cash. Regular purchases using the card are free as long as you're in the same country that the card is denominated in. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:24:39
I don't particularly agree with this sentiment. Yes miners should have a say, but so should users and business owners. My signalling of UASF won't necessarily change anything but it at least is a way for me to voice dissatisfaction with the current hold up of Segwit.
@_date: 2016-05-19 05:51:54
Perfect, thank you!
@_date: 2016-05-14 17:10:48
I suppose that could be true. What was their argument to convince you of this? From my understanding of things, I thought that miners had to sell a lot of their coins to cover their overhead costs. I suppose some miners could be hoarding coins, but I don't know how they would fund their operation in this case.
I'm interested to hear this person's reasoning.

Like a few other people who have commented, I would also recommend trying QuadrigaCX. They've worked quite well for me in the past. You'll need to sign up once you have a bank account, but after the initial set up it's pretty seamless.

He made some bad investment decisions early on in life, so I think that had some effect on his current line of thinking. He assumed it was a ponzi scheme initially, but hasn't taken the time to move past that and learn more. Maybe being involved in the show will sway his opinion!
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:31:16
While I get this sentiment and think it's a great deterrent for thieves, I also worry that other people could be screwed by this. What if the thieves use that bitcoin to buy things at merchants who are unaware the currency has been stolen? Then later on they discover that their money is tainted and will not be accepted everywhere. That could be a slippery slope. Over time more and more of the money supply would be accepted less places because it is "dirty money". 
Feel free to poke holes in my logic, or let me know a way around this. It's just the first thing that popped into my head.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:36:00

@_date: 2016-05-13 02:01:55
No age limit! Online exchanges may require you to be a certain age, but if you use a bitcoin atm or localbitcoins then you can avoid those altogether. 
In Canada the bitcoin atms require no identification at all. Scan your QR and insert bills.
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:19:30
I agree with you partially, but I also see the merit in this article. Companies like Coinbase and Circle are a fantastic tool to introduce newcomers to the technology, while keeping them in a familiar environment. At the same time, I can appreciate this guy's hopes that forward thinkers will come up with solutions that allow everyone to ditch the status quo, regardless of the current regulatory environment.
Basically I'm appreciative of what's currently happening, and I really can't wait to see what's next.

@_date: 2015-10-07 18:13:36
I definitely think this is the case right now, and the foreseeable future. However, I believe "remittances and lattes" will play their part as bitcoin becomes more widely used. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:10:52

@_date: 2015-02-16 06:33:19
I don't believe bitcoin will be stable enough to fully use as a currency for years to come. However, the fact that I was able to survive the entire month of December and make various international transactions with something that didn't even exist 6 years ago is nothing short of astounding. 
If someone doesn't like the volatility of BTC, there are now services through CoinJar and UMEX that offer protections from that, while still being able to transfer value (if I'm not mistaken). 
In short... yes, price fluctuations at the moment/in the coming years pose a problem. If Bitcoin succeeds, those problems will no doubt be fixed over time as the ecosystem is built and more users/investors add depth to the market. To me, that possibility is worth buying a few less useless trinkets for my house and instead speculating in this new technology. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:20:53
Ok I shouldn't say no one. There are a few billion people that are unbanked that have a need for bitcoin in order to be included in the world economy. I suppose I meant that people living in 1st world countries that are a part of the existing system don't currently need it. However, there's a big difference between need and want. If it becomes more widely accepted, a lot of merchants are going to WANT the reduced transaction fees. 
Just because there's no need for something doesn't mean it won't take off. People didn't need internet and email... but it had something to offer, and evolved based on the wants of the community. Is it wrong thinking that bitcoin will take the same path?
I get it... speculation is not your thing. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:34:36
Thank you sir!
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:33:15
It's speculation. I believe the price right now is less than it will be at some point in the future. Pretty simple. To anyone who doesn't believe the same, then I would recommend not doing the same thing I am.
Also... of course it helps bitcoin in some small way. I've contributed to demand, and limited supply, as you've acknowledged. People holding BTC affect price. A higher price means more reward for miners, who are maintaining the network. 
As far as the next price spike (if it happens)... Would I take some money out? Yes, but only to cover my principal investment. The rest would be held quite long term, or until it's accepted by enough merchants that I don't need to convert back to fiat.
I can appreciate that you don't want to buy and hold bitcoin... but telling me to only buy when I need it means I would have put exactly $0 into BTC. I don't see how that supports the ecosystem any more.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:14:29

If this girl were able to get a job paying in bitcoin and subsequently survive on it, she would basically be the poster-child for bypassing the current financial system. I imagine that would make for some pretty damn good PR for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:17:12
I'm comfortable because I believe in the long term it will be worth more than that, and I have no need to sell any time soon.
@_date: 2016-05-20 03:44:55
Yes I would say it is a very risky place to park your money, but in comparison to my saving habits before bitcoin, I would still be up if it crashed by half because in normal circumstances I wouldn't have saved any of it.
It also depends how you buy in. I do it gradually over time, regardless of the price. This removes the emotional mistakes that you might make when you try to have good timing. At one point I was buying when bitcoin was still at $800, but because of dollar cost averaging I've actually doubled my money the past two years despite the "expensive" BTC's I bought in early 2014.
I'm relatively young so I'm comfortable with putting my money in something high risk at this point.
@_date: 2015-10-31 02:42:15

No ID, but it can vary from county to country! I'm in Canada.
@_date: 2016-07-18 21:03:09
Yeah I think this exchange has been the most consistent and reliable for me. I was going to do a video on Coinbase as well, but it seems they are pulling out of Canada because Vogogo shut down and that's their payment processor.

Earlier in the convo I said that I have spent bitcoin and even lived entirely on it for a time. I don't know why people get their panties in a wod because I've decided to hold a decent amount as well.

Good thing I'm buying and supporting the price from going lower then.
@_date: 2016-07-12 04:51:04
Sure, sounds great. I leave Calgary in 7 days for a backpacking trip, but would be game before then!

That's a good question! I'll be doing a video on AirBitz two weeks from now (after my Bitcoin ATM video). After that I'm going to have a friend of mine who is brand new to Bitcoin give his genuine opinion using both wallets for the first time. Hopefully this will help you in your decision making process! 
I also plan on making videos for exchanges, so I can touch on the mobile apps for Coinbase/Circle as well!

I didn't say I've never bought anything. I did the month in December where I used Brawker.com and other bitcoin accepting services to pay all my bills. I've also used it at a coffee shop I go to fairly often, and for a few purchases off amazon using Purse.io
What I DID say is that I didn't exactly need to use it. I chose to. Technically no one NEEDS to use bitcoin if you really look at it. We have an existing financial system. I would just argue that if it gains enough traction, bitcoin will be leaps and bounds better than the current system.

I'd be down for doing an interview. Been interested for a year and a half now. I entered the  contest and was one of the finalists. Also spent December living entirely on bitcoin thanks to Brawker.com
I'm no expert, but would be more than happy to share my opinions based on what I've experienced so far.
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:22:42
Ditto. Canada is a breeze. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 06:36:24
Haha yeah, the bar has now been raised higher for me. 21 would be nice, but who knows if I'll ever reach that level. Then again... it wouldn't be all that upsetting if the price took off and it was unattainable. At least my current stockpile would be worth a pretty penny. I mean... satoshi.

Copay is my go-to wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:39:48
I would say you're in pretty good shape, especially compared to some people. When it starts to become a very large amount of money, it's worth it to look into other storage options though. Currently I have some of mine in cold storage on paper wallets. I'm also starting to play around with both my new KeepKey and Ledger Nano, which are hardware devices. 
All of the options I mentioned here work quite well, and have unique advantages/disadvantages for each. I'll be doing videos on all of those in the future. For now you might want to check out  and play around a bit, just to familiarize yourself!
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:00:27
I am. I have no need to sell in the foreseeable future either, so I'll continue accumulating bitcoin when I can. I very much enjoy that this bothers you so much.
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:14:57
How about Gemini? I heard they can now serve Canadians? Anyone given them a try?
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:54:52
Indeed! Truthfully I've become a lot more financially conscious since getting into bitcoin. I've learned so much about the current financial system and its flaws. I now budget my income for months in advance, manage to save, don't overspend, and still have $ left to get a nice foothold in the BTC ecosystem. I'm so glad I came across it. Truly a life-changing learning experience.
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:32:54
Really? It redirected me to Amazon. Perhaps I was in the wrong place?
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:31:51
I knew of Bitaccess but hadn't heard of the other one. Where is it located?
@_date: 2016-05-18 16:42:57
This may not apply to everyone, but I've never been able to save until I found bitcoin. I currently have the largest amount of savings I've ever had in my life. I would try it out and see if it helps you, but only spend what you can afford to lose.

@_date: 2017-06-19 22:01:55
No worries!
@_date: 2016-07-04 21:22:47
Thanks! I'll post another next Monday :)
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:07:12
I saw an article the other day saying that the average transaction cost on ETH is now $1.50 - so they will have the same problems. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:22:56
Hey I'm from Canada and I leave for a backpacking trip throughout SE  Asia in 4 days. I'm hoping to meet/interview some fellow bitcoin users while I'm on the road
@_date: 2016-07-05 13:30:46
Hey thanks so much for taking a look! Copay has been my go-to wallet for quite some time now, so thanks for your hard work :) I'm super glad you enjoyed the video, and any additional promo you give it is a fantastic bonus for me.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:36:03
Great to hear! I agree, I love seeing new developments :)
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:17:17
10 seemed like a milestone to me. Different strokes I suppose. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:36:40
Fair enough, good to know!
