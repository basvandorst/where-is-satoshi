Truthfully it may be hard to find a direct conversion rate, as I don't think any exchanges offer trading pairs in Sumi.

I think an important question here would be, use it for what? If their goal is a store of value, it probably makes sense considering bitcoin's historical value relative to Venezuela
I say this because the avg price of one bitcoin (on bitstamp ) 4 years ago today was $4.97, according to bitcoincharts.com. Today it is $418.32. 
The price of one bolivar (at street value) in Venezuela 4 years ago today was $0.0107, according to dolartoday.com. Today it is $0.0009.

This is complete speculation, but it's possible that NIRP could be further incentivizing investments from larger funds in more traditionally higher risk opportunities such as VC in bitcoin space, considering the loss of value over time with keeping it sitting in banks.

Latency hack would account for the empty blocks, fair enough. 
However, I don't believe blocks are filled to capacity every time around, nor completely empty every time around. So how do the large miners find their balance between latency efficiency and supporting/securing the network?
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:09:52
How does this make any sense? The utility of bitcoin as a store of value is nowhere near its utility as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2015-06-20 03:12:02
Unfortunately it's a real attack vector (albeit one I decided to brand myself). Also one often discussed in different forms at the BitDevs meetup in NYC, you should really try to make it out--I'm sure you'd learn a heap.
I'd also really recommend reading up on how transaction propagation works. If you google "how information is transferred on the bitcoin network" or something along those lines, there's a spectacularly comprehensive whitepaper that should come up on information/transaction propagation.
If you control the means of propagation you control the network.

It increases the orphan risk for any miners outside of China as they will experience greater (block) broadcast times than miners within China. This is so because a majority of the bitcoin mining hashrate is geographically located within China.

Taking out a line of credit (ie. Mortgage) is vastly different than giving up equity in your company to a VC. I would never call giving up equity when it's not necessary 'cheap'.

That's my point. Utility and price are not one in the same.

If one believes XT is an invalid proposal, one shouldn't be afraid to debate it in open forum (and hide behind the 'it's not bitcoin' argument).
No one should be 'outed' because their opinion diverges from the status quo, they should be proven wrong publicly using data and evidence. 
However, if someone chooses to ignore well explained, well proven arguments, and outright trolls, I believe they should be banned or post blocked for trolling--not for discussing something contrary to someone else's beliefs.
Semantics aside, XT is very much a proposal to scale bitcoin. Whether it is valid or not as such, is what we should be solely focused on IMO.

To the second, absolutely not. I actually enjoy my continued ability to make money in this space. However, generally speaking, I don't know of a single company I've consulted with that hasn't experienced massive growth over the past 3-6 months (as measured by active/recurring users).

Hey Marshall,
How about this: even with all this discussion around scaling, we still manage to have miners mine blocks without any txns in them. How do miners go about deciding when to include txns in their blocks, and how many to include?

A bitcoin client that has the full bitcoin transaction database (AKA blockchain) downloaded, and is connected to other nodes with the intention of sharing this data.
Smarter guys than myself can, and probably will, elaborate further on the technical differences between full nodes and non-full nodes (ie. SPV clients).
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:41:38
Gotcha. 
&amp; I understand this is probably an incredibly abstract question, but is there any way to compress txns while they're being sent on the network? (decompressing at the client/implementation level) 
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:46:31
Finally someone gets it. :)
@_date: 2015-12-25 01:54:19
An overwhelming majority of profitable companies in this space haven't raised money from traditional VC channels. They've been angel funded (in stealth) by a few whales or self-funded entirely. If a company is cash flow positive and capable of organically scaling, there's also no need to approach VCs for additional capital.
VCs are unfortunately notoriously bad investors, and they're often viewed as the guys who make the mistakes that later, more risk adverse investors learn from.
Also, if I know I have a profitable idea and have resources at my disposal to execute said idea, why would I give up equity to generally useless investors? The exclusion here being strategic investors--firms like A16Z and DCG that can leverage their vast portfolio and resources for companies they're particularly interested in.

Well said Erik. Shameful is an unfortunately accurate word for how we as a community should feel about these sorts of actions.
If one believes XT / BIP 101 is a flawed solution to our current scaling issues, attacking opponents through such means as DDoS is quite possibly the worst way to prove one's point.

You still have provided no data. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:34:02
I wouldn't exactly call that statement correct. A 0.01 BTC holder that transacts 20 times a day is more valuable to the system IMO than a user that holds 100 BTC and never transacts. Although value is a generally relative concept, to begin with (ie. Value from whose perspective).
If one is going to nitpick user values, at least do it comprehensively. :)
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:49:52
You have some valid points here, but in all fairness NASDAQ is only using their prop chain (proprietary blockchain) for settlement on their private shares market (which secondmarket got acquired into). 
This is far from the playgrounds that HFTs usually prefer as it's low volume and frequency trading compared to public markets. 
It shows there's potential value in prop chains, that's undoubted. However, they should always be inherently less secure than bitcoin, due to less mining power and node distribution.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:43:20
Incorrectly structured blocks or different sets of rules aren't necessarily the concern here. The concern is data consensus.

I'm not taking a stance on the bitcoin.org topic, but in regards to the analogy used here gift cards *are* money.
That's not saying they're the most ideal form of money, but they are. Just in the same way XT may not be an ideal implementation of bitcoin in some people's eyes, it is very much still an implementation of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:05:36
Exactly, you have control over what becomes an Orphan chain and what stays the Main chain. More importantly, you also have control over the mempools of the miners mining each chain and therefore over what txns get placed in either.
@_date: 2015-06-20 03:26:46

Sorry to burst the idealogical bubble there, but unbiased perspectives don't exist.
@_date: 2015-12-21 16:58:17
Unfortunately it doesn't generally work this way. 
Most miners sell for market value almost instantly (sometimes even before their 100 block waiting period, through margin on exchanges). They generally don't like to place higher-than-market limit orders, waiting for higher prices, and risk the market moving away from them before their orders get filled.
If they're losing money at market value, that's a different story. But most miners would turn their machines off before operating at negative cash flow.
@_date: 2015-06-20 02:23:04

Whoever it is would be may hate bitcoin, but they'd want to recover whatever money back they could.

If you Sybil attack large miners, you can essentially propagate their proof of work as your own to the rest of the network and therefore always have the longest chain.

The closed nature of most proposed prop chains wouldn't open its revenue streams (ie txn fees) to external actors.
In other words, why in the world would they ever want to let you mine their coin?
I heavily doubt they would move forward with a SHA256 base if they decide on PoW.

I very much believe in bitcoin, and that is exactly why I'm trying to address this potential attack vector publicly. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 05:48:29
They never would have broadcasted the chain to the rest of the network as the attacker controls all the nodes that the miner's node is connected to. 
Therefore, the attacker also controls the mempool of those miners BTW. 
If you isolate a large group of miners from the rest of the network for a short amount of time, let them build a larger chain the rest of the miners, and then reconnect to the network with a longer chain you essentially just exercised full control over the bitcoin network. (a form of consensus attack)
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:52:13
I see what you're saying but a 51% attack wouldn't allow you to forge a transaction either, so that's not necessarily a relevant argument here. (Here's a great short read on 51% attacks: 
Also, double spend capabilities of the attacker become significant. 
IE. If they are able to isolate a Merchant's node (control every node the Merchant is connected to) and send the Merchant coins to buy something, you can keep their node believing those coins were sent while not broadcasting that txn to the rest of the network (99% controlled by attacker, anyway).
@_date: 2015-12-06 06:18:26
I feel as if it's less an issue of decentralization, and more of simple ROI. IMO miners have a vested investment in the health of bitcoin as a relatively low cost, quick payment network just as much as they do BTC the asset. 
I say this because I also believe a fundamental price driver is the (perceived) utility of bitcoin the payment network. 
Apologies if I'm unclear about anything--it's a bit late here in NYC.

"And capable of organically scaling". Just look at the track record of VC backed companies in the space, and you'll see what I'm talking about. I'm trying to avoid being antagonistic here, but most companies with teams of founders that know what they're doing don't run to VCs with open arms, unless they're cash strapped. They're better off approaching strategic investors or taking out a line of credit if they need scaling/growth capital. Giving up excessive equity is just plain foolish.
Thankfully, I don't need affirmation of my value outside of my ability to grow cash flow. 
Regardless, history remembers those who solve problems, not as much those that constantly complain about them. If you want to help the space, get out there and build something. These condescending comments about people actually willing to put themselves out on the line for their companies are getting a bit dry.

Great question, and I can only provide my opinion in response. 
I believe China currently offers the largest use case for bitcoin (capital flight) and has greatly subsidized the mining and therefore security of the bitcoin network, and therefore deserves more consideration for any development implications than just any other country/region. 
That being said, I believe creating workarounds within the protocol that can apply to any internet-buffered region would only help the network to scale and grow more resistant to state actor attacks.

Good points, however the issue still stands of a profitable, large miner not wanting to risk future earnings.
IMO unprofitable miners won't turn their machines back on as they lose more in electricity costs than they earn in revenue. It can be argued that bribes can subsidize these miners to plug back in, in the short term. But this would be an incredibly expensive subsidy to maintain over time and at scale, compounding in costs as difficulty rises. 
BTW this NiceHash pool is fascinating. Thanks for sharing--reading up on it now.

@_date: 2016-03-30 14:19:18
Interesting idea, but I'm not sure I can subscribe to this theory.
AFAIK there aren't any pools that let you run your own custom bitcoin implementation or even have any control over the actions of your rented hardware. 
In regards to a miner accepting higher fees for forking the blockchain, you have to account for future earnings lost (missed opportunity cost) as a result of the reputational hit, and therefore price hit, bitcoin would take on with such a noticable attack. Within ten minutes someone would be posting about the double spend here and probably elsewhere. 
I guess the question to ask would be, Would any large miner consider that a worthwhile risk?
@_date: 2016-03-31 16:58:56
Slower block propagation times increases orphan block risk for non-chinese miners.

Interesting read (and I admittedly have to complete my reading of their actual report) but off of first impressions they haven't accounted for issues present with the great firewall of China.

@_date: 2016-01-06 06:47:08
Apologies, but aren't orphan blocks simply blocks that were successfully mined but broadcasted after another miner's succesfully mined block? 
I define successfully here as providing a hash that sufficiently meets the difficulty requirement.
&amp; gotcha (I think). So the SPV miner could theoretically just be fed bad data?
@_date: 2016-01-23 23:25:48
Honestly, if people don't like miners being mostly in China they need to:
1.) Stop complaining.
2.) Start large mining operation elsewhere.
3.) Profit.
If one can't perform the above steps, one shouldn't be talking.
Capital and resources generally follow the path of least resistance. China is currently a friendly enviroment to operate a mining farm, that is highly scalable and relatively cheap. Until that changes or more friendly environments take shape at scale, it will remain the mining capital of the world. 
If there are specific issues with that being the reality of the situation, those specific issues should be addressed with pragmatic solution proposals.
Expecting people to make unprofitable decisions (ie. Setting up shop elsewhere) out of some altruistic obligations to the world and bitcoin ecosystem is possibily a bit naive.

The economic majority generally acts to maintain those principles. That assumption is based on fact they chose to participate in the network in the first place.
I hate to draw binary situations, but IMO if it came down to it, the economic majority would be more likely to uphold those principles over specific, arbitrary numbers.
@_date: 2016-01-09 17:22:38
If XT, or any alternative implemention, ever gains majority adoption wouldn't that make it the 'true' bitcoin and Core therefore, CoreCoin? Assuming conflicting rule sets.
I'm just confused why people try to only tie this risk to XT, when it could just as well happen with Core.
I may be missing something though--just let me know if so.

There are a lot of directions bitcoin can go. 
It's not about taking what people tell me, it's more about me understanding the needs of the market. If the people actually making bitcoin's pipes work on a daily basis, and using it on a daily basis, agree that something needs to happen it's probably going to happen. 
For reference, to reach concensus at that scale is no easy feat.

@_date: 2016-06-08 05:30:58
You're correct, I just double checked.
For some reason I thought the shares were redeemable for BTC after a 12 month lockup period, but the case is actually that they're only available for resale on the secondary market after the 12 month lockup.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:51:44
Why do you believe that to be the case?
@_date: 2016-06-07 20:27:52
I believe it's converted at NAV bitcoin price, not market price of GBTCoin.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:33:26
No one referenced purchasing power, I believe I specifically said price.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:17:18
Supply is artificially limited either way, but I do understand your point. 
However, there are bitcoin being held by GBTC for every share issued. Unless Barry is running a fractional reserve system over there, which I very heavily doubt to be the case, that is effectively the price that people are willing to pay to gain exposure to bitcoin.

I could have perhaps used better wording though, I agree.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:32:48
It's just that I've talked to Andreas (founder of android bitcoin wallet app) a few times and really like their wallet's simplicity. 
I may have to opt for mycelium or airbitz next time though
@_date: 2016-02-25 02:46:32
Understood--I appreciate the candid explanation.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:14:11
Much appreciated, I'll be shopping around different wallets this weekend for sure.

All sepa transfers are in EUR, so you'll have to either use SWIFT or international ACH for USD deposits from non US banks--although I don't know of any exchanges that accept international ACH.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:29:46
Truthfully, I'm convinced now. I would be willing to pay 5% of tx value, it doesn't matter--I just want a confirm.
This is incredibly frustrating. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:36:52
How do people expect customers to just be ok with a transaction possibly, maybe, most likely going through??
User experience is crucial to gaining adoption for any consumer facing tech, and this is the antithesis of being user friendly. 
There has to be a way to address the issue of unpredictable confirmations / overly long confirmation times.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:28:14
I believe he meant arbitrarily. 
But pls, let's not make this another block size debate.

Thankfully managed to work everything out. Apologies again for aggressiveness!
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:40:20
Are there possibly any datasets publicly available to check this? 
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:43:44
Thanks to you for saving!
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:00:36
Of course, apologies if I came off a bit aggressive. 
I'm just incredibly frustrated at the moment as it's directly resulted in me losing money. Unfortunately managed to include that sentiment in my response more than intended.

Pretty cool stuff!

I've heard of it, but unfortunately have no first hand experience with it. 
I'll try it out for sure, but am curious why you recommend it specifically. Any notable differentiators from alternatives?
@_date: 2015-04-26 01:53:24
How about tipping people the money and challenging them to tip it out from there?
This at least removes the barrier to entry of acquiring BTC...
@_date: 2015-04-27 23:04:06
Irresponsible man... Really shouldn't just make up stuff like this and post. It can lead people down incorrect, potentially harmful, paths.
Being a large LP, or more specifically a DMM in most exchange's cases, means that you have access to a *special* fee structure on either the maker or taker side, which usually translates into lower fees than everyone else on the take and higher rebates on the make. 
However, all of this must typically be documented somewhere in the exchange's fee schedule. No one just gets a magical 0 fee treatment because they're 'buddies' or 'seat owners' with no one else even knowing about it. At least not without the exchange risking their SRO status (if they're public)...
Now while that means preferential treatment most likely occurs, special case 0 fees for my buddy treatment, doesn't.

doesn't have to do with HFT or not, has to do with how much volume you give to the exchange.

Just for reference here, UltraCoin was/is the name of the smart contract software implementation. 
It has always rode bitcoin's rails. Reggie has been consistently adamant about utilizing bitcoin's already existing infrastructure to secure the system.

This. I'm constantly battling the first world, and candidly privileged, mentality that bitcoin is strictly a payment rail. 
Yes, the dollar &amp; euro work OK as stores of value. Venezuelan bolívar, no so much.

Interesting side note, they also have the most bitcoin ATMs of any country in Asia:

False. Any bit of research actually done by one would bring one to the conclusion that this is the the cumulative volume across all the exchanges in Japan. 
Granted the fees maintain a sense of abritrary value, considering zero fees. However it has reached a point of being nonnegligible IMO regardless.
@_date: 2016-05-09 18:08:06
Gotcha. I need to hone my semantics skills when it comes to describing govt debt I see.
I appreciate the clarification!
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:57:54
Apologies, I meant block size limit.
RE: supposed lack of control, so core dev team has or has not blocked any attempts for block size limit increase?

Technically IIRC the Fed only has the power to set monetary policy (ie. Interest rates), but the Treasury actually prints the cash.
@_date: 2015-11-26 23:09:44
Don't get me wrong, the bitcoincharts site &amp; api is helpful and all (been using it myself for nearly three years now), but it's not as comprehensive or reliable as BNC's data. 
I also only say that because I have talked with the teams behind both. Bitcoincharts is more of a hobby to its operator than a business. BNC is working on this full time, around the clock.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:15:59
I've yet to see any evidence.
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:45:42
This. I never understood why there was even a debate in the first place. 
Who among us is able to determine appropriate block size or even rate of growth? Hint: no single person or organization. See central banking for more information.

Shh :) upvote for noticing it, but let's try to keep these kinds of spreads on the DL moving forward lol

Switzerland seems to have a bit of a more open approach towards regulation as well.
Does anyone possibly have an update on the group that was trying to launch a bitcoin bank out of the country?
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:23:58
Agreed. I feel as if from the perspective of a potential developer looking to create smart contracts on top of the most secure blockchain in the world, it can be viewed as a bit unfortunate however.
@_date: 2016-05-09 17:40:30
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here, but no state has the power to print money? That's a power mandated to federal governement/entity (Treasury).
Since PR falls under federal jurisdiction they shouldn't be grouped out of the U.S. picture here.
@_date: 2016-05-09 17:05:04
This. Just because the big oompa loompa says it'll work out ok, doesn't mean history won't replay itself in the States. Inflation and hyperinflation are very real things.

They offer onramps/offramps to the bitcoin ecosystem for underbanked, cash-heavy segements of the population. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 13:24:57
I tend to rely most heavily on BraveNewCoin's indices
@_date: 2016-05-09 17:55:15
I followed you up till that last sentence. Why is the ability (yet apparently lack of desire) to bail them out enough to qualify the statement 'the US can never default'? Ultimately, they have defaulted and they haven't been bailed out. That's not theory, that's fact.
Therefore, it could be argued that the US has indeed defaulted on debt.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:52:32
There's a long list ahead of them. 
Also, FWIW at least they're in a position to have slip ups that matter, unlike the armchair pundits often attacking them.

Welll, technically just incredibly improbable. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 05:42:45
That was a bit of hyperbole, granted. Although I feel it makes more sense to at least debate how to best construct this mechanism vs construct an arbitrary number to use as a limit instead.

Absolutely, I'd be glad to tell you. It's absolutely extraordinary, I promise you.

I'm telling you, it's great.

Gambling use is actually what drove bitcoin adoption and price initially (see SatoshiDice). 
Not to mention dark net market volumes are pennies compared to the driving money at this point. It's a trader and investor-driven market.

Bitcoin scripting language isn't turing complete unfortunately, so there's quite a bit of added functionality that rootstock offers bitcoin. 
However, Rootstock tokens will be pegged to btc.

This displays a deep misunderstanding of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin ecosystem has been developing secure, stable solutions for improving user experience significantly over time. It maintains dominance relative to altcoins over the most important UX component there is: reliability.
@_date: 2016-05-07 20:34:20
I don't know whether to laugh or be concerned. I'll just do a bit of both.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:11:57
Evidence of their volume significance is what's lacking.
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:26:43
Sketchy, absolutely. But they've also been leading the price rallies, so perhaps worth noting here (especially considering the possibility of there actually being capital outflow from China through BTC) 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:59:44
Since weak hands jumped ship, yep. 
Volume topped when price did, as it always does.
Not much.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:34:40
Insinuating the amounts are inaccurate is insinuating either blockchain.info is providing inaccurate data or the global blockchain ledger is incorrect. More than an internet comment with no data will be required before that claim is accepted and responded to.

Precisely. Not to mention all altcoins ride the economic infrastructure built by bitcoin companies and bitcoiners.

In all fairness, I'm not specifying value paid to people or companies--I'm simply referring to net value moved over the network.
@_date: 2016-07-14 03:40:12
Why shouldn't change be counted in a figure representing total value settled over the network? 
All outputs matter...

Qualify 'not the same' in the context of how this information was labeled and shared. 
There's no misinformation here, I'm simply 'telling it like it is'. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:35:14
Wouldn't that then mean the market sees bitcoin as a safer asset to hold than Lira?
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:52:26


Out of curiosity, what data leads you to this assumption?
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:46:38
This is an invalid comparison. Digital gold =/= stock.
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:53:04
You could, but there's nothing gained by doing that outside of accrued transaction fees and increased bloat to the mempool if you're spamming txns.

Theoretically, mined oil could be used to power bitcoin miners to further fund admin/logistical services.

Calculated by adding the products of daily BTC output and that day's daily weighted bitstamp price. Therefore, it accounts for movements in price over time.

Can't say it's satoshi dice due to lack of data suggesting as much, but it's certainly a lot of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-23 19:18:00
I find their example of mapping API using Google fascinating, considering the step they mention where user has to enter billing info to proceed. 
This essentially creates an arbitrage opportunity where people who have access to required/accepted billing credentials can leverage these credentials to 'buy' google API services for free, and 'sell' API services in 21 market at slight markup (ie. $0.005 per request).
I'm a fan of what 21 is shaking out to be.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:13:31
All outputs for transactions included in the blockchain were included, which removes any assumption on the nature of an tx output.
@_date: 2016-07-14 05:18:43
Do you happen to have any data on how often that happens? 
@_date: 2016-07-16 05:11:24
The picture in the link shows the price and volume in TRY is mostly attributable to BTCTurk, a Turkish bitcoin exchange.
