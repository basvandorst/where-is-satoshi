So in order for something to be labeled under fiat, it can't be finite?
Trying to understand the meaning of fiat.

What are you talking about please? Don't know "the log charts"

As far as cryptocurrency faces go, Vitalik is nice.

Okay, so 
with a future contract that works with a cash settlement, you're basicly betting. As in, you don't need BTC to "sell" BTC and when you "buy" BTC you've never getting any BTC?
In the case of the CME contracts:
Who's actually "theoretically selling"? The CME group or the people buying a contract? And if you go into a contract with them, I suppose you get to choose the "betted" price/BTC yourself?
Is this a one time only thing? I've seen people talk about "10th and 18th will be a rollercoaster". Is it only on the 10th and 18th that these sorts of contracts will be offered? Or is it from the 10th and 18th on that these groups start offering them?
Thanks for clearing it up for me.

It won't.

Why isn't BTC fiat then? Isn't it also not backed by anything? Or does it have to be government related to be fiat?

Can someone ELI5 how that portion of the charts work?
The red "steep way up" is people selling bitcoins at 14k? is that something they automated?

You'll end up with more BTC, without spending more USD.
So that's good.

Bitcoin isn't a brand owned by anyone.
The Bitcoin logo isn't trademarked by anyone.
The original founder of Bitcoin is anonymous.
Bitcoin is open source.
So don't think there will be much sueing... :(

As far as I was thinking: if something bad happens to BTC PR (media shits all over it) and price drops, then ETH and LTC will drop also, but most probably not as hard.

If you actually want to fix it but still be a misogynist. You can change "All" to "Most (if not all)"...

Bitcoin Cash is a Bitcoin hard fork (when the blockchain splits up into a new chain) Because the community didn't agree on some changes that were being made to the Bitcoin network.
Bitcoin Cash thinks they are "the real bitcoin". There is rivalry between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin. So having Bitcoin Cash show up in GDAX is a blow to Bitcoin Cash "haters".
Also adding Bitcoin Cash to GDAX made it's price go up. This is logical, and expected. So there is speculation about GDAX buying into BCH and then allowing it into their exchange so they have a lot of added value.
But really, don't worry about it. They are just 2 different cryptocurrencies and a smart investor should diversify their portfolio and not "fuck BCH because some millionaire is mean on the internet".

If you're thinking about an EMP strong enough to get every node in the bitcoin network offline, then losing the most recent version of the ledger will be the least of your worries.
If you're thinking about just "A really strong EMP", then some nodes might survive and the network will be unhindered.

Your coins are on the blockchain. You can access them with your private key
Ledger nano S stores your private key.
Ledger nano S gives you a "seed" made out of 25 (or was it 20?) words. Which can be used to generate the same private key that it originated from.
This means that any Ledger nano S, when given that "seed", will be storing your original private key.
If I made a mistake in my explenation, someone correct me please.

But what defines a fiat currency so you don't fall in the category, but BTC also doesn't? Trying to educate myself here.

You can't use "Any" and then call it a truth.

really no harm in having at least 10% of your portfolio be divided amonst LTC and ETH.
bitcoin is only gaining value over ETH because it's more popular. If cryptocurrencies become the next means of worth (as the internet became the means of communication), ETH will skyrocket. If cryptocurrencies don't do that, then Bitcoin won't be retaining it's value either. So...
If you really want "all in" on BTC, maybe just 5% of your worth in altcoins then? It's only safe.
