Great post, 100%
We are going to see prices continue to increase in all sectors at an accelerating pace. This will drive us to max out consumption and at some point, resources won't be able to hold. That's when 1% loses, either through debt forgiveness or through the guillotine.

LN is L2, there will be many L2s.. so no

Calculate the cost of those panels, then how much BTC you expect to mine. Then compare if you just used the money to buy BTC. That's what matters, anyway.
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:09:32
Nice feel good story but the reality is nobody buys solar panels to mine because the panels themselves takes 10+ years to pay out, this guy is not taking into account the full economic analysis..

They don't do it on oil wells, they just buy gas from the county gas infrastructure.

Think about how hard it is to get bitcoin. Do you really want to spend that hard money at some retail store? Why not spend visa and get collector points etc.

I think Hal is the most important figure in bitcoin, more so that even Satoshi. Not only was his work instrumental in Satoshi's implementation, but Hal was the first follower. It cannot be overstated how big of an impact Hal made - as someone who does product design and introduces new products for a living, I know from experience how practically impossible it is to get people to adopt new tech. People feel safe sticking with status-quo and generally need to follow others by example, Hal led the way.
As sad as I was to learn Hal's story, I am comforted knowing his idea's will live on for eternity in the present iteration of Bitcoin, future iterations and the communities it has and will continue to spawn.
I get chills thinking of Hal's accomplished life, every time!! RIP

I'm a miner and I certainly have never tried to villify a fellow miner, Bitmain included. Only pointing out that ViaBTC and Antpool had the exact same person controlling their social media. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:51:34
Totally agreed, let them put them selves out of business if they want. 
  
Also great resource johoe thanks for this!
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:36:00
Panels have a terrible payout generally, so I doubt it.
@_date: 2018-10-03 05:27:24
Yup. I liked Brian and his silly videos until he started acting like a huge wanker on twitter, not a likable guy at all.
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:14:57
Right.. yup the pool operators really care enough about this english subreddit that they called each other up and agreed to make it seem like they were one and the same just to fuck with us here. +1 logic
@_date: 2018-10-30 06:04:12
Bitcoin \*is\* a commodity
@_date: 2018-10-31 01:23:31
Very cool service idea!
@_date: 2018-10-30 06:12:32
Don't forget the time the ViaBTC twitter account posted something that was meant to be posted by the AntPool account - the same person was controlling both accounts and forgot to switch back.

This is just pointing out that EVs are uneconomic relative to alternatives.
@_date: 2018-10-30 06:05:44
Great interview juansgalt, I enjoy your material.
Miners are a service provider, they provide confirmations.
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:16:22
We do care. If you believe the pools are too centralized, your appropriate response is to consider bitcoin less useful since it is at risk of censorship. This means you require more confirmations and you value the coin less. 
There no other appropriate response.

Good take

Very good point, thanks.
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:59:36
Pirated streams, sure. Seems like a perfect application for BTC - censored media.
It isn't closed, that's just an outdated typo.
@_date: 2018-11-01 06:21:05
You're gonna have to show me the photoshopped tweet because I have no idea what you're talking about right now, I think you have the wrong tweet in mind.
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:30:44
Pretty sweet, but you'd have to be a fucking moron to broadcast to the world that you are bitcoin rich... $5 wrench attack in the making...

Bread wallet is crap, quit when it wouldn't let me do custom fees.

Bitfury sucks
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:14:53
I don't think anyone really cares about the hashwars. Anyone who knows anything about bitcoin security certainly doesn't give a f\*\*k
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:21:22
Simply speculation, no need to think price correction has anything to do with a few measly million dollars worth in wasted kWh's.
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:30:56
Omg who gives a damn about RSK.. bringing the Eth shitcoinery to BTC..
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:57:07
This is the most beautiful piece of art I have seen yet in Bitcoin and an incredible tribute to Hal. Thank you on behalf of Bitcoiners everywhere.
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:34:07
It mainly signals that mining is becoming even more energy efficient as the high-cost miners close up shop. Only the most efficient operations can continue to add hashpower.
@_date: 2018-11-30 06:23:40
I think you're talking about these guys [ ?
@_date: 2019-01-09 02:06:57
Read up on the libbitcoin wiki
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:04:45
It's secured by the willingness of merchants to take risks to avoid censorship, paying higher fee's to non censoring miners.
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:59:22
Spenders cannot target miners no, but they can increase fees. 80% of miners are censoring your Tx's, you can just increase your fee until someone in the 20% is willing to accept it.

Advances in technology, in particular computation, is why we've seen exponential growth and wealth increase. It would have been better distributed had we been using sound money such as gold / bitcoin etc.

What is powering your ASIC?
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:00:38
It is definately going lower, we are in for several months of side/bear market still

When people like yourself stop making posts such as this one! 
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:38:03
You can't drive prices down unless you have bitcoin to sell. How can Rockefeller et al be simultaneously buying up BTC but also driving the price down? What kind of magic is this?
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:51:47
Another BTC maximalist is born..
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:20:41
Lol you are an absolute idiot if you think this (and a tool for your response). I guess the law of supply and demand mean nothing.
