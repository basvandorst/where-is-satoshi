Yep we want to keep the value low so no one wants bitcoin!

Ahhh ok so if it includes crypto that limit would include transfer to even a wallet. 
Thank you I should've asked here hours ago.

This is what i want to know as well because I posed a DNS redirection question earlier and OP said he logged into his friends account and it worked. 
Can anyone answer this one for me please or did OP forget that he didn't actually login to his friends account?

If that's the case it does seem to point to more of a security breach of bittrex's servers than anything. Also if you've never sent or given your master code for the 2fa to anyone or left it in email. 
 I would like to think the attacker would've stolen your friends account as well. 
Doubtful it's the company themselves but a lot of internal breaches do come from the inside. I would have to pose that question to bittrex they need to at minimum review some logs inside their infrastructure. 
Also I don't like that you and a friend share logins that smells a bit.

The real question is how do I get advice from those pro traders?

Were you on any kind of "public" Wi-Fi? Were you using a laptop or anything with a WiFi card plugged into it? 
Actually would it be possible to get malware that changes your DNS config that points to their fake DNS server. Then from there to their fake bittrex website? Wouldn't the url appear legitimate at that point? 
Edit: maybe we should all start typing directly the IP address into the browser.

If the Gox crash and silk road reputation didn't kill it with such a smaller "user" base, it's not going to 0. 
The only way it'll ever be worthless is if it becomes irrelevant ie Bitcoin is broken and can be hacked.

I sincerely hope you were not trying to be a "trader" paying coinbase's ridiculous fees.

It's not bitcoin it's your exchange gouging you. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:33:40
Yep they need to generate a number on the screen and then call your phone with an automated service and have you enter that number over the phone. 
No more fake websites. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:36:26
Get the ip address of bittrex server type that directly into your browser. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:55:21
That's true it's not fool proof but it may be suspicious getting redirected. Maybe I should write a quick program to verify DNS before logging in.

Now it's possible without being on the same network. That's the problem I believe. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:48:50
I like the way you think. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:04:32
Thank you I really didnt want to type all that out but couldnt bear to let that comment stand. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:32:44
Curious, what makes you think it isnt?
