if you know the private key of an address (by knowing the private key, you automatically know the corresponding public key/address, too), then you *hard-code* a transaction (this is then called *raw* transaction) by manually writing down the components of a transaction according to the bitcoin protocol, converting it to hex and broadcasting it to the bitcoin network. this process involves no wallet software. 
the bitcoin wiki has information about raw transactions: 
at blockchain.info (but also at other sites), you can broadcast raw transactions to the bitcoin network:

you can register at any exchange and you will most likely only need an email address for that. you can deposit bitcoin and trade without providing identity verifications. when it comes to withdrawing your bitcoin, you will probably face limits on how much you can withdraw per day/month depending on the level of verification you provided.

then you create many paper wallets and store all your funds in the first. once you want to *withdraw* a bit from your bank, you create a transaction that sends the desired amount wherever you want to and the remaining funds to the second paper wallet address.

you can use  or an alternative block explorer site like  to search either the transaction id, the sending address or the receiving address (depending on what information the sender can provide) and you should see it - or it didn't happen.

if you login to your blockchain.info wallet account, you should see that you received funds when the balance increases. also, when you click on the transactions tab, you should see incoming transactions. 


i believe this is the case, because the blockchain.info generates a new address for you, whenever one address has been used (has received funds). this has privacy reasons and you might want to search for bitcoin address reuse if you want to know more details about this. 
you can see all the addresses ever used, if you click: settings, then click: addresses, then click managed address, then click: show addresses.

if you have cash and you want to exchange that into bitcoin, then another option besides a bitcoin atm is to find someone who is willing to trade cash vs. bitcoin. 
there are websites/services where you can look for other users to meet up and trade face-to-face: 
*  
* mycelium local trader (part of the mycelium wallet app:  
*  
* a regular bitcoin meetup in your area 
there might be other sites/services i am not aware of.

there are indeed debit cards that can be topped up by bitcoin payments, e.g.  google for others. 
as an alternative, you could use  to find people nearby willing to trade your bitcoin for cash. however, i doubt it will be cheaper than an old-fashioned currency exchange. you could also use  to find business nearby that accept bitcoin.

that is quite a long time. have you thought about what happens if ledger (the company) terminates business and shuts down their servers (sending from a ledger wallet requires connection to the ledger server as far as i know)? 
if that case should occur, your coins are stored like in a paper wallet and your ledger device becomes useless. fortunately, it is not a big issue, you can still access your coin as long as you have your set of 24 random words (source:  
what i am trying to say: ledger wallet is a great device. however, for storage over a super long period, it does not offer much additional value compared to a paper wallet.

but safer (as pointed out in this reply), and that should be more important to you than convenience when using cold storage, i.e. you use paper wallet, because it is safe, not because it is convenient.

maybe because there are not so many pending transactions waiting to be included into the next block..? 
[here]( you can have a look at the number of pending transactions and also how many transactions were included into the previous blocks. currently, i see around 700 pending transactions, which is less than the max. capacity of a block. the last time i had a look at that site, pending transactions were more than 3000.

wallet.dat contains your addresses and the corresponding private keys. only if you have those private keys, you can access (i.e. send) bitcoins stored at those addresses. 
the solution is to protect yourself from losing that file by backing it up properly or by storing the private keys elsewhere, which is equivalent to protecting yourself from losing the password to your email account. there are alternatives to using the bitcoin core software: other wallets (so-called hierarchical deterministic wallets) can back up the wallet into a text phrase which can be backed up/stored easier than a file.

wait a few days, until the number of mempool transactions (=number of transactions waiting to be included into a block) will be lower than what it is currently. you can check it [here]( then the transaction fee will also be significantly lower.

i had a similar problem two days ago and btcjam was also slow to load, but it worked fine yesterday. i have not checked again today, though. 
what i found out in a facebook group was that the btcjam website was down due to a ddos attack two days ago, so this could be related.

* in bitcoin, the sender is responsible for the fees 
* the fee does not depend on the amount of btc you send, but on the size of the transaction in bytes (i.e. the space it requires in the blockchain, the ledger of all transactions). 
* currently, the bitcoin network is working at its capacity limit and there are plenty of transactions waiting to be included into the next block, i.e. waiting to get confirmed. if a block has capacity for 1000 transactions, but there are 3000 unconfirmed transactions waiting for confirmation, then those 1000 with the highest fee will be preferred over the rest. it is an open market. if you send a transaction with little fee, it might take a long time to confirm. if you send a transaction with zero fee, it might never confirm.

definitely not. 
you can deposit bitcoin at certain echanges (to loan out your coins to other users for margin trading). as an example, the daily interest at bitfinex would have given you an annual interest of soemthing around 6%. but i guess you have heard of the hack recently... 
there is a service called magnr ( offering something similar: loaning coins out to margin traders.
