My apologies, we could force the payments to be done on a certain system. For example, there could be ether contracts setup for the payouts too, if X is done then payout person Y etc.

And think of all the money that is currently being wasted by corrupt politicians or embezzled by shady corporations, all of it will one day have to be out in the open!

Tether is fiat, look into their relationship with bittrex. Some really shady stuff.

1. You don't need to buy a full bitcoin, you can invest $5000 if you like and still own a fraction of a bitcoin, it's highly divisible. Its a smart idea to keep adding increments monthly (but as you have mentioned in the post already, consider it all lost, as a worst case scenario). Even after you get 1 bitcoin, continue buying if you can.
2. Don't worry too much about the price, HODL.
3. Start reading the FAQs on the sidebar, i think it will answer some of the questions you might have.
4. No one is going to realistically tell you how much they have invested.

Make another account on a different exchange and you can do it yourself. I don't want to come across as an ass but this screams like a scam.

but..buuut my seed!

Keep it to yourself, even if the price goes to the moon. The more people you tell, the higher risk of just exposure to unnecessary risk. But DO tell people about bitcoin etc, just don’t go around telling how much you hold.

Everybody’s talking like bitcoin is worthless etc etc, I’m just sitting here that the price dips and I can buy more!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:57

Even if it isn’t bitcoin, the concept of currency using the block chain is what I was referring to.
