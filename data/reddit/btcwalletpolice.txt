They have lots of 3rd party JavaScript trackers loaded into the webpage from various different domains. Aside from the tracking it's a big security hole as it allows remote execution of code by anyone owning those various domains.

Pretty damn close, iPhones are a walled computing environment, the chances of Bitcoin stealing malware being on there is close to zero. The key is generated on the phone and for the period of time he has app installed it is encrypted using iPhones hardware. 
I think the security vs simplicity you asked about, this wins. You trust Apple basically, but kind of in the same way you trust Trezor or electrum. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 03:19:58
It is necessary. Everyday a blockchain hack. Busy raising money. Not securing bitcoin. A warrant has been issued.
@_date: 2014-11-28 14:03:20
Agree , you've correct , but the basic point is that stretching is a poor mans entropy and 10 rounds of SHA is next to useless
@_date: 2014-12-04 09:12:55
The main problem people have is that they have spent all their money on promotion and marketing and not done anything to update their wallet and patch major security holes. They are he most popular wallet and the most insecure. If you care about Bitcoin as a technology this should bother you.

As long as you didn't create the wallet using a webbrowser on blockchain.info during the time their code was compromised (12:00am and 2:30am GMT on December the 8th 2014) you should be ok. Your coins would most likely have been swept already if you were affected.
@_date: 2014-11-30 10:37:21
It solves part of the problem, your wallet still relies on a user securing their single backup phrase. Anyone sees or finds this they can empty the wallet anytime.

It takes you through everything step by step, that phrase you wrote down is all you need to recover all your funds, new addresses are created for every transaction automatically and the wallet is secure. It also uses cryptography instead of math.random.
Welcome to a real wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-28 10:25:40
If you use random passwords no stretching is required, this is the point

@_date: 2014-11-30 07:20:28
There does seem to be some kind of organized campaign against blockchain at the moment, and I think at one point they innovated. But as more and more people have pointed out the flaws with their security model, they have done very little, and normally only when publicly shamed. Contrast with the breadwallet dev who seems genuinely obsessed with securing people's bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-30 22:15:28
It is a service, that people use who want direct control that exposes them to a numerous attacks, as opposed to not doing that. What would be good is a service that people use who want direct control- that doesn't expose them to numerous attacks.

@_date: 2014-11-28 06:01:14
the comment was a reference to the performance of javascript in the browser. ie. if they did 100,000 rounds it would take forever in the browser and screwup their onbaording process...so they said, screw security, we want users!
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:44:46
They use 10 rounds by default. In the code comments it says "this is not good, but it's javascript".
They are a joke.
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:44:43
I don't work for them. They haven't spent any money on development for around a year aside from a few updates and a bunch recently after being called out.
They bought the domain name Bitcoin.com and are at all the conferences etc. I imagine they made a small amount of money from ads and chose to spend this on user acquisition. Probably a good strategy. 
But don't complain when people call them out on getting left behind in terms of technology.  
Maybe I will be proved wrong and they have been developing in stealth for the last year and will release something amazing in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:44:26
This is a great model and a big step in the right direction for Bitcoin, the old days are gone and some of the incumbents need to wake up and smell the competition

@_date: 2014-11-30 22:12:04
This will be great... How would the signing process work?
@_date: 2015-05-27 01:42:17
**EDIT: this theory is probably wrong, but leaving it here to remind people to choose random password and switch on 2fa or use a proper wallet... **
if you search your inbox, see if you can find your blockchain.info identifier
see if this returns your encrypted packet (replace YOURID with your identifier)
if your password wasn't random and you can get back your packet (means 2fa not on)
then my best guess is:
* Email compromise
* Identifier found
* Get packet
* Crack offline with botnet
* Wait for funds
Similarly if you ever sent a backup to your email...
@_date: 2014-11-27 09:02:59
Main obstacles. People. Time. Security. Reasons to aquire Bitcoins. We are now in early speculation phase. 5 more years of this. Then network effect. Enough people have coins and enough have trust. Starts to be used. Security problems resolved by technology. 5 more years of slow adoption for high value use cases. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 04:06:15
Can you provide more info please?
What wallet were you using? O/S etc. What happened with the phishing attack?
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:53:27
Their implementation is near worthless. 10 rounds of sha256 is pretty much as good as 0. If anyone made off with their database, it would be very easy to crack most of the packets using password lists. They secure a high value target with terrible cryto. Multi-sig is the answer.
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:04:01

@_date: 2014-11-28 10:09:09
Not true, if you use random long passwords there is no need for stretching, but hackers have lists of commonly used password + likely passwords, so you can't apply the random space logic to determine how long it could take. Stretching is all about slowing a hacker down and 10 rounds does very little
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:11:04
You would never accept being CSO of blockchain.info and not change anything. A more interesting question is why blockchain have hardly updated anything in a year. Have they lost their backend sourcecode maybe? They have cash now. 30m.

Decentralized wallets connect to the Bitcoin network directly , and so may take a long time to sync or not be able to send if it can't connect to a node. It also doesn't have a full copy of the blockchain so can be lied to by malicious nodes. It also communicates private data in the clear with unknown counterparities.

Well, actually you do as they reuse addresses for change, but anyway, people using them don't even care about that, they use them as disposable wallets, literally btc is stored there for 10 minutes and then they sell advertising to the dudes on the other end of the transaction who need to "spend" Bitcoin....oh and their bs coin mixing service...
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:35:42
Your encrypted packet is store on their server and is accessible via a url, if you use chrome and open developer tools and login to the site as normal, you should see the call in the network activity tab, see if you can get this url and access it directly after wards

Blockchain.info is a really shit web wallet...
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:44:45
Well, then someone could have got hold of your guid from a cache left somewhere , got hold of your packet and brute forced it, they only use 10 rounds of sha256 so if your password was in anyway memorable it would have been reasonably easy
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:58:17
they might have done for all we know...also, there are tons of exploits out there and not all of them get hacked, you need the nuts and knowhow to do it, most hackers are morons not cyber-geniuses
But the fact they have these issues in plain sight would mean I would not use their service
Also they deliver code via the web too which is terrible

Very easy. Locate target. Hack email. Look for backup. Check local browser storage, get encrypted packet. Brute force with usual shitty passwords. Only 10 rounds of sha256. Bullshit. setup Tor exit node, wait for idiot to go to website. Serve them a fake one with fake cert. Get password. Go to real site, empty wallet. Hack blockchain.info, replace Javascript with your own. Send all transaction to different address.

You will have noticed no one is spending the money on advertising , the reason is Bitcoin is nowhere near ready for mass adoption.
The big ones are building out their infrastructure in preparation for the future. We are 5-10 years away from Bitcoin being something other than a niche hobby and media fetish.
A bunch of them also probably raised too little too early and will disappear soon. No one is turning a profit.

Lol, that's a very conditional argument.
Either way you are not "screwed" as you have set your limits accordingly 
@_date: 2015-09-04 11:06:51
This isn't true. It depends on the strength of your password and when you created the account. They used to use 10(!) rounds in their pbkdf , not sure what they use as a salt, but it is in their db for sure. If you use any slightly popular password, it would be trivial to crack the password given the db.
@_date: 2015-09-21 05:37:24
Note the use of the word "generate". The function to switch on mining in Bitcoin core is called setgenerate
By nodes he was referring to mining nodes, the concept of a non-mining full node didn't exist yet as specialized/centralized block generation wasn't a thing

Try opening dev tools in chrome and look at network tab, see where it is trying to connect to to execute the recovery transaction , they might have changed the server name or something 
@_date: 2015-04-21 08:00:50
browsers shoudln't be used anyway...
different devices are optimal but same device for online and recovery key like bitgo still a huge advantage over single sig wallets
every time it is subsequently used for a transaction is WAY safer
Plus if someone reads your key or guesses your password you are not screwed as you are with single sig wallets

@_date: 2015-03-05 13:51:17
It is safe to post the transaction id assuming there is no privacy issues you are concerned about.
24 bits should be ok, but is a little low, you might have to wait a while
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:36:27
You really shouldn't be doing this if the unspent is not change...
There are potential legal consequences for you users as they can unwittingly double spend if the unconfirmed input is itself double spent. In fact imagine a chain of non-confirmed transactions by n number of people all using breadwallet and the first person in the chain double spends, you have potentially put n-1 people in a dangerous situation
@_date: 2015-03-05 13:32:23
Also , is it the latest version of breadwallet?
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:01:50

@_date: 2015-02-03 13:34:52
Yes, one way around this is to randomize the output index of the change address to prevent guessing the change address. 
But, as you said the two spent outputs would tie two addresses together.
But anyway, HD wallets are trackable to a degree, the scenario in the article relied on address reuse
