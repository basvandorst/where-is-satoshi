as of now it's sort of in a grey zone the world over. neither legal, nor having been declared explicitly illegal / banned. At your own Risk kinda thing.
I mean, if you went to the cops and told them someone robbed you of your BTC, they would just look you up and down.

I guess i would add my location if i had nothing to hide. 
As an example, if i was a store or a local business, that would just be added publicity for free. right.
Same for a user buying coffee or a sandwich. If i am already sharing my location on instagram, snapchat, why do i care that someone saw me pay for my sandwich with bitcoin.

i would. maybe i'm just looking at this whole situation differently.

but wouldn't the fact that you could use bitcoin or whatever at your local stores and shops just like regular currency be a pretty good argument otherwise?

no. if you want some form of legal adoption, you would need to make sure that majority usage is legal. right.
