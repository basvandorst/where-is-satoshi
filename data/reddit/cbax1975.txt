Neobee is not bankrupt folks , they cannot afford an attorney to file and they have zero financial records, so no bankruptcy court will ever accept them. They just closed up shop and will go away. Should be a long running joke for a while though , until the next scam appears. Should be about 2 weeks then.

Keep drinking the koolaid. You 5 years in the future you will be slapping the current you again for being such a silly lemming. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:51:43
The point is that there is nothing proprietary about bitcoin. No need to speculate on the "whys", it's just reality. Any macro move to acceptance will be made by a major player, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:20:28
In times of desperation people make stupid predictions based on their biased opinions and the lemmings eat it right up. A buyout of mt gox? Lol you people really believed that? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:26:15
Just like a doomed stock always has a huge spike before the final demise. Same rig gig here. All bitcoins eventually will be a zero. Sorry for those who lost, congrats to those who gained.
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:10:56
You know its in a decline when you are hoping for things that have not even been developed yet to save you. The steady decline will continue.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:50:22
Even if you buy a bitcoin then immediately spend that bitcoin you need to report the buy/sale to the irs just like a stock. The irs basically turned the lights out on your btc party.

Sorry, but this is not a charity. All btc has become is an extremely speculative commodity.

You'll get them for $1 within a year or 2.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:35:00
Please pal. People talk their own book. You buy some btc and all of a sudden you are some long term believer in this garbage. The only reason you are on the radar is because of the hot money. Those who are "idealogical believers" are also known as bagholders. You will be left holding the empty bag at the end once all the hype is done. I really hope the DOJ/SEC institutes a federal ban on this scam. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 12:14:10
Amazing some of you still cling to "saving gox"... Really, it's unreal unless you are just bullshitting us.

Btc is low fee for retailers/vendors compared to credit cards, but for the average joe btc user the fees can be rediculous. Its basically like a stock and there are fees/commissions every time you buy or sell. Oh and dont forget about tracking buys/sells and cost basis for the irs. Yep, really no advantage for the average joe to use btc right now, a burden in fact. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:47:46
The protocol. Lol. You lose 99% of people right there.
Sorry, we dont trust anything to do with this bitcoin crap that somebody invented a few years ago. Just because you chose to believe in it doesnt mean we all should. If bitcoin was $1 would you still be this passionate about it? No. You are here to try to make a fortune.
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:37:12
You losers still trying to save Gox? Everyday, save gox, save gox save gox.. guess what, it isn't going to happen! The reason there is not 200 agents parachuting into Karpeles apartment is because nothing real has been stolen, just some fledgling digital currency! If someone stole 750,000 Dogecoins would expect the same investigation? How about theft of 750,000 easter coins or how about world of warcraft or video game gold?? To most people Bitcoin is no different than the other fraud coins, you just think BTC is more important because you and the china lemming horde inflated the price. You entrusted Mt. Gox to be the custodian of your coins and the company failed, end of story. Add your name to the list of investors or asset holders who lost money when a company fails.
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:24:15
Couldn't think of a group more prone to being scammed than bitcoiners.. You guys are basically bent over with your pants pulled down waiting for it.
Neo and Bee? LOL. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:43:37
Those of you not in the us will still be involved in the other criminal elements of btc (besides tax evasion).

Bitcoin is not ready for prime time yet. It's just a novelty today.
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:12:56
Things like this will be more common as the scams grow..no bank wants to have their reputation dragged into the mud by doing business with people like mtgox and neobee and the countless others who have and will walk off with your coins when the timing is right. It is just a matter of time and all of these non-us "companies" will rip you off. As they say..
wait for it...............
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:22:16
Yep, buried amongst the pumping lemmings are folks like me interested in reality.
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:09:27
I think you missed the point. All 95% of bitcoin owners want to do is get rich from a price increase, cash out, convert to fiat. I'm sure if they "get rich" they will keep a few btc to spend and be part of the "community".
In china, they dont care about the community or your dream, the massive hoardes of speculative money will pile into anything. Since pboc restricts their ability to convert btc back to yuan, its useless.
@_date: 2014-04-26 20:00:06
Oops, you missed the memo. Jap courts already decided-no rehab. Jeep dreaming though!
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:48:28
You're a dope. You have no evidence the other guy's account was closed due to btc yet you prepare this ridiculous letter. I hope Chase does not even respond and you close your account. Are you sending certified mail or are you too cheap? 
 Just silly.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:08:47
It doesnt really matter if you are still up, you lost a lot of money by NOT selling into the parabolic spike in november. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:13:40
Did you call the police and file a report? If so, perhaps. Otherwise, you have no evidence, it would be loss of property just as if you lost your gold watch..you aint getting nothing back unless you have insurance.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:07:34
You had a taxable event when you converted btc to shares, just like if you purchased something. You would seperately have to document your neobee capital loss which would offset the gains of the btc. You mustve sold your neobee shares though, not be stuck holding them. If your neobee shares are locked and you cannot sell then you cannot take the loss right now. Or you could just not say anything, its all fantasy money anyway. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:51:21
Dose of hard reality for the lunaric fringe here. What crypto currency do you support?
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:20:21
Who said anything about the IRS owning Bitcoins? You may not live in the US, so it may not affect you, but here we have the IRS to answer to and they just basically said bitcoin is like a stock so you must declare a cost basis and sales prices every time you acquire or dispose of a bitcoin. 
Sorry you don't understand.

Your daughter gets threatened and then you leave the country leaving her behind? You said you notified the proper authorities regarding the threats, but the police of the country that your daughter is in are not aware of anything. 
Lol, yea sure pal, that makes sense. 
Glad to see you are so nervous and worried about your situation that you felt compelled to make this idiot post. You must not be sleeping well because of your thievery or utter incompetence.
I didnt lose a penny because of you, but for all that did:

@_date: 2014-04-18 11:18:23
I understand you are either trying to make a buck or recover your massive losses here but this idea has about a 0% chance of working. Gox is dead, do you not understand that yet? Posting crap like this only delays the healing process by giving false hope to those that lost out. This post is even less effective than the people who stood outside gox with signs saying "we want our coins "
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:28:26
Right bud, if new money cannot come in the price will not rise and the ponzi begins to crumble. They will sell.

Dont worry, you are looking at a small period of time and this decline is not over. Long term BTC goes to 0.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:34:15
Not keen necessarily, just intrigued as most of you are. I havent seriously considered an investment in btc as of this moment and do not see how it would benefit me (besides capital appreciation)

If you do you will lose business. If i was shopping for jewelry and i saw a shop was accepting bitcoin i would move on to a shop not as shady.

Its being propped up for the time being but the trend is still DOWN down down. It takes a while for the hysteria to fade when you have kool-aid drinking followers involved. When the real plunge comes, you wont see it coming and you certainly will not be able to get " out "

Typical overreaction by the kool-aid drinking lemmings here. He bought btc 11 months ago and you think they closed his account because of it? Any proof of that or just OP's post? It seems like a long stretch to me. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:12:26
If thats the case, you are twice a slave. First to fiat and then to bitcoins. At least in my enslavement I dont have to worry about much, meanwhile you spend your days shuffling around paper wallets and security keys.

Amazing people fall for this kind of thing. Sorry man, lesson learned, hope you didn't spend a lot.
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:26:54
Umm, no, i dont dabble in unregulated ad-hoc markets like digital currency. Bank accounts and credit are protected.
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:26:55
This "attorney" is misleading. You must track all buys, sells, acquistions, and transfers whether for personal or business use just as you would for a stock. You do not file a 1099, but you may receive one from your broker/exchange if they are US based (unlikely because most of these scams operate in havens for money laundering/illegal trade) so yes, the burden will be on you to track your btc activity and report it to the irs. If you choose not to, thats on you. The big money players that control the btc price will certainly be impacted as they dont lie to the tax man.
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:35:20
Like you said, nothing proprietary about bitcoin, google or any other big player can create their own crypto-currency and instantly be more valuable and more widely accepted than btc. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:21:32
You making this post is an early sign of you starting to panic. Wait until btc gets down into the $300's $200's 100's and below then come back here and i will tell you a tale called "the bagholder" and you can tell us your story.

Come on man, crypto currency is created out of thin air too. Bunch of digital BS. You don't have freedom from banks with bitcoin, not even close, you still rely HEAVILY on fiat and banks.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:50:51
Umm, no ya dope. I said the IRS declared Bitcoins as property. Anyway, enjoy your losses.
Reuters) - Wading into a murky tax question for the digital age, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service said on Tuesday that bitcoins and other virtual currencies are to be treated, for tax purposes, as property and not as currency.
"General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency," the IRS said in a statement, meaning that bitcoins would be taxed as ordinary income or as assets subject to capital gains taxes, depending on the circumstance.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:17:28

I cant believe some people are still supporting this guy, that threat doesnt mention his daughter, the guy ripped you all off folks , neobee is another fraud. No legitimate business runs out of money in a few months and the guy bails because of an internet threat. Once these people get ahold of you anonymous coins they cant help but steal them and rip you off!
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:49:48

@_date: 2014-04-02 13:22:05
You dont need to file a 1099 but you just had a taxable event. You need to track your cost basis at which you acquired those coins and the exact price per btc when you disposed of those coins. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:25:12
Do I really need to say more than danny charlie and mark? How about silkroad? Most of you in the US are not planning to track your btc buys and sells and properly report to irs are you? Tax fraud/avoidance is a crime. Anonymous money leads to the criminal elements all bitcoiners have been soiled with. You dont get AML letters from banks for being a good guy.
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:39:59
If you invested 140k and have 770 btc then you bought them for $182 each and today the price is $380, over double your money. No wonder you aren't panicking yet. How about these people who bought at $600, $700, $800 and up? Lets see how cool you are when it hits $50 and all your gains turn into massive losses.
