Hey, to everyone downvoting me:
I'm an avid supporter of Bitcoin and blockchain technology in general. I'm not some BCH shill, I'm just stating facts here. Rather than downvoting my post, please tell me what you disagree with. Thank you.

It's actually probably safer to download the official build, rather than the"nightly" one.

Apologies, I miscalculated.
The actual time till difficulty recalibration will actually be roughly **24 hours**.
BCH readjusts its difficulty every 2016 blocks. We are currently 871 blocks to the next recalibration. At the current hashrate (3.993 Ehash/s +114.3% in the last 24 hours) we are mining roughly 36 blocks per hour. 
**817/36 = ~24.19 hour until next readjustment**
Thanks for pointing this out, I'll update the thread.

These units are arbitrary. There's no reason that 1 bit needs to be 1 dollar.

Mods deleted my post. Why?
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:06:48
As it should be.

Stop, my mind is imploding

The Fed has the power to influence inflation, and the economy is stabilizing. Our GDP was so much lower 100 years ago.

I can't tell if you're trolling at this point. But I'm going to assume you're not. I'll try to explain this as simply as I can.
The Federal Reserve is the central banking system of the United States. Congress created this system to with the goals of maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates.
Our central bank has **massive influence on inflation rates** because *it is what dictates our monetary policy* (the monetary policy is what controls the supply of money, often targeting an inflation rate or interest rate to ensure price stability and general trust in the currency.)
The monetary policy is referred to as either being **expansionary** or **contractionary**. 
An **expansionary** policy is when a monetary authority (the Fed in this case) uses its tools to stimulate the economy. An expansionary policy increases the total supply of money in the economy more rapidly than usual.
A **contractionary** monetary policy slows the rate of growth in the money supply or even shrinks it. This slows economic growth to prevent inflation. 
Ok, so that's the basics of what the role of our central bank is. So what are the specific ways they influence inflation / deflation? Well, believe it or not there are many ways to do this. But the primary method involves altering the **Federal Reserve rate**.
The Federal Reserve rate is the rate at which banks borrow money from the government, but, in order to make money, they must lend it at higher rates. So, when the Federal Reserve increases its interest rate, banks have no choice but to increase their rates as well. When banks increase their rates, less people want to borrow money because it costs more to do so if that money accrues interest. 
**So, spending drops, prices drop and inflation slows.**
I hope this was helpful. The Federal Reserve is a complex system and inflation is a very broad subject, so I highly recommend reading about them. Here's some helpful links:
*The Federal Reserve*: 
*Monetary Policy*: 
*How does the government control inflation?*: 
*How monetary policy influences employment and inflation*: 
Hope this is helpful. Take care.

I said that the Fed limits inflation, and you proceeded to totally ignore (or misunderstand?) my point, so I explained the what the Fed was to you.
Again I will say that **inflation occurs naturally as a country's GDP increases** (you stated the exact opposite of this in your previous comment -- you're blatantly wrong). Considering this, of *course* the value of the dollar is going down. How could it not?
Regardless, the dollar is one of the strongest and stablest monetary notes, which is why the U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.
Please. Just educate yourself before commenting again.

Bro... No. Just no.
This is simple economics -- GDP growth is correlated to inflation (the Fed has nothing to do with this, but they try to limit inflation by adjusting interest rates, etc.)
Please educate yourself:

Ok, first off, you're statement is already wrong. The Fed doesn't print U.S. dollars, they just control the money supply.
Your errors aside, you need to understand that **increasing the money supply does not necessarily increase inflation**.
Suppose the money supply increased by 4%. In a simplified model, this would lead to an increase in Aggregate Demand (AD) of 4%. If productive capacity (AS) stayed static there would be no increase in Real Output, only inflation. However, if the increase in AD of 4% was matched by an increase in AS of 4%, there would be no inflation, but, just an increase in real output. 
**In other words, the money supply can grow at the same rate as real output to maintain same price level (i.e. *no inflation*)**.
However, if money supply grows faster than the rate of real output, it will cause inflation. But, in the real world there are other reasons why an increase in the money supply does not lead to an increase in inflation.
Of course, other things factor into this as the velocity of circulation, difficulties in precisely measuring aggregate demand, etc. If you want to read about all the factors you should read this article: 
Anyways. I'm done responding to you. You obviously have a very flawed understanding in the fundamentals of economics. I highly recommend you take an Economics course (or at least read something like The Principles of Economics by Gregory Mankiw) before getting in a debate again, or else you'll make a fool out of yourself just as you've done here.
Good day to you.

Can you repeat that in english?

There's no way that's true in the forceable future.
