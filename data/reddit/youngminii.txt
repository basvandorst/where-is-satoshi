You're measuring the price decline of 3-5% in either direction by analysing charts this specifically, and if you're trading or banking based on 3-5% you're either in the wrong game or you're gambling.
Buy when its low and bullish, sell when its high and bearish (or not at all) but don't do it because a technical chart tell you its due for a selloff, especially in such a short term.

Learn to understand when a market is bullish, and when a market is bearish.
A stock that is only going up is not bearish, and by prematurely trying to time the top, you missed out on even more.
It is far better to hold until it becomes bearish. Yes, it may correct and spike down, but wouldn't pulling out at $500 (not that it'll go down that much) be better than pulling out at $61?

One way to prevent this, or hedge your bets, is to sell half and keep half.
You would've still made 25% without half the risk.

A computer science method of ensuring that the validity of the end result is still perfectly secure even though much of the 'path' or 'tree' that led to the end is truncated.
That's my understanding of it without looking it up again anyway, and I agree with you, I don't think a single person I know in crypto (50 people in my group chat alone) knows what it is. Except maybe one, but to be fair he's been in it longer than me and also studied computer science.

1 in 3 South Korean workers hold crypto.
Think about that for a moment.
Edit: Going by the rest of the comments on this thread, I don't think people here quite appreciate the insane amount of trading in South Korea at the moment. The technology there is ridiculous. Your account is approved instantly by linking your phone number (which is already linked to your social security equivalent ID). You can withdraw to your bank account within 10 minutes any time of the day, for most of the popular banks. In fact it's easier to withdraw than to deposit fiat. You can pretty much trade in and out of crypto and fiat instantly, with almost no friction along the way, and a $1 fee for the withdrawal, up to $50k per day for a level 1 verified account.
Combined with a heavy trading culture, a fairly rich nation, technology focused and zero crypto tax, you have yourself a huge trading country.

No... Because they had more than enough to pay people back fully under bankruptcy rules (pegging the bitcoins at ~$450 USD each), but the whole point of pushing for civil rehabilitation was to pay people back in bitcoin terms, even if it means less total bitcoins, it amounts to much more in $ terms.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:57:43
In my behind-the-computer opinion, it's just market forces correcting the value of Bitcoin, surely it's still worth more than $500. I suspect there'll be a few movements until the real current value stops at like $850~ for a few months, probably after a small crash.

Fuck that shit. Never again. Only invest what you have, and what you know.
@_date: 2016-06-21 09:06:42
One suggestion is to average out your purchases.
Instead of deciding whether to buy 100% now, or at a future, undetermined time, you can spread your purchases over a period of time.
So, 20% today, 20% next week, 20% the week after and so on and so on.
You minimise risk and average out your wins/losses. Its almost like reverse gambling!
It works great with bitcoin since exchanges only charge a % of your purchase, never a flat fee. Which means you'll be charged the same % whether you buy 5 lots of 20% or 1 lot of 100%.

@_date: 2016-06-18 16:43:00
Basically, there is a bitcoin-like application called ethereum which instead of using code as money, they use code as 'smart contracts'.
If we make a contract, then the contract will run as per the code written for it. These applications were to create virtual companies that had perfect autonomy and stockholder voting to be done by use of virtual tokens interacting with the code.
It appears the technology is too young, or conceptually misguided, as the code governing one such virtual company was found to have a vulnerability in the code. The DAO accidentally allowed attackers to claim Ether by essentially faking a withdrawal with their tokens, calling the same bit of code over and over again. The attacker was able to rack up 3.5 million Ether in a matter of hours.
3.5 million * $13 = $45.5 million
The Ethereum community, unlike Bitcoin, has a leader in its 19 year old creator Vitalik Buterin who was also heavily invested in this project. The DAO was created as a proof of concept of sorts. Their mission was to help create more of the same, and to further Ethereum in general I assume.
Vitalik plans with his other Ethereum devs to freeze the attacker's funds (soft fork) and then return everyone's tokens (hard fork). Doing this, the hard fork especially, means to rewrite the code of Ethereum to reflect a different history of transactions, one where the attacker never got the Ether. In this history, everyone can save their stolen Ether.
The problem is, the entire code was written in hopes of creating pure autonomous companies that only followed code, not people. They tried to borrow the philosophy underpinning bitcoin, and tried to apply it to all contracts in general. To go back on that and rewrite everything because a contract had a flaw in it means admitting that to some degree, contracts shouldn't be fully autonomous. The very underlying notion driving Ethereum forward.
To make things clear, the contract that got hacked was not part of the Ethereum software/network itself. It is merely a contract that used the facilities that Ethereum provided, yet **what they are suggesting is to rewrite the history of the entire network itself**.
If that's not a failure in the proof of concept, I don't know what is.

You're probably right about BitFinex not becoming insolvent, but don't attribute them to malice/market manipulation.
It would be incredibly malicious and downright nasty to attempt to orchestrate something of that magnitude with exchange-held coins. The rallies were due to market sentiment. I firmly believe that.
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:26:23
Because they might be able to convert their tokens into BTC and cash out, before the price of ETH/Tokens reach 0?
Think of all the people getting a refund. What will many of these people do with their tokens? Cash out. Price will plummet even further. Time does not wait.

@_date: 2016-06-21 09:33:15
So you're saying they didn't seize it, they merely obtained it.
Going by your previous example, what if there existed a safety deposit box with the vast majority of a bad guy's funds? And another trusted person knows the combination to that box, and in the case of a bust then the trusted person is instructed to wipe the box to many different avenues?
The gov agents get NOTHING.
Surely by this time, some people would have been 199% sure that with state of the art safety deposit box design, with a feature anti-theft, once you give special instructions instead of your regular password, the funds get distributed to other avenues.
I think its just human stupidity and recklessness that gets funds seized. It won't stop.

In Japan bitcoin is legal tender, merchants accept it in an increasingly wider manner.
Korea has mobile apps that allow you to use crypto through Visa/Mastercard/Amex transactions.
Between Korea and Japan there was about $3-5 billion dollars traded in crypto in the last 24 hours alone. And we all know how fast they are with groundbreaking, technological revolutions.
Monaco is about to announce a Visa associate partnership. They are shipping cards out this month, starting with Asia &amp; Europe Q4.

But at the end of the day, I'd rather keep my bitcoin. Because its not worth just its 'purchasing power'. It has unfathomable future value.
As my friend said to me a few hours ago. If you have bitcoin, it will always 'be there'. No wallet, no card, no internet access. Technically if you knew your wallet key, at no point in the future would your money ever be lost. It will always be there in literal cyber space.

Yes. Bitfinex allows shorting for about 10 major coins, and it also allows margin trading 3 to 1.
Also, as the other guy said, be very careful here. Even with a surety like Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum Classic, both of which have no real use anymore, the Asian countries have a lot more shorting and leveraged options than we do. When a price looks good, they make their moves, and you can lose a lot of money by shorting something which by all means, has no right to be a billion dollar coin.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:54:06
Its because the blockchain is a record of all events &amp; transactions that have taken place.
A fork, is literally taking the same history, and then creating a second future.
Therefore, pre-fork, bitcoin and bitcoin cash are the same thing. Post-fork, they split off into two ends (hence, 'fork').
Its like if time-space ripped apart and there were now two timelines. Started as 1, now there's 2.

It is because last time, the media said "a dangerous fork is coming up, be careful" and the market sentiment was that you could possibly lose everything by holding at the time of the fork.
Anyone that's been in crypto any amount of time knew that was bs, and got in right before the fork to get both coins. That isn't the reason why everything is going up though. A side effect of these 'free coins' was that people just sold them off and put the money in more Bitcoins.
After that fork, Bitcoin rose from $2.8k to $4.3k AND all the altcoins pumped extremely hard in a recursive feedback loop. Bitcoin pump -&gt; Altcoin pump -&gt; Bitcoin pump -&gt; Altcoin pump etc.
For example, NEO went from $7.50 pre-fork to $40 post-fork.

You also need to do the following to have it 'appear' on your MEW (since it isn't officially listed yet).
On MyEtherWallet, click the "Add Custom Token" button on the right hand side of the screen. Enter the contract address 0xf814d88af9f624257880ae1c6b519d87116810e8 , put name as DDOOS and decimals as 8.
You should now see 9 DDoos.

I'm so excited for Segwit2x.
The tech is whatever, but I know with a near-certainty that the current Segwit2x futures are severely underpriced.
What's everyone going to do when 35% of the hash power leaves the main chain?
People will move money to Segwit2x. Because money can be made there. And everyone will FOMO when the bull run starts.
I don't know if there will be a flippening, but even if not at 0.2 btc per Segwit2x future, you can easily 3x that (in bitcoin terms anyway).

In the near future there will be blockchain based 'banks' that use smart contracts to hold your coins for you. Possibly for a small fee.
It makes sense considering the ease of which money is lost in this space.

No one thought this. r/btc were supportive of S2X for the longest time, and hated r/bitcoin &amp; core. Conversely, r/bitcoin &amp; core hate r/btc and S2X.
Bitcoin Cash came out relatively out of nowhere, the fork was contentious, r/bitcoin &amp; core HATED it, so r/btc supported it.
Segwit2x was supposed to be the original fork that went against core. But Bitcoin Cash came up later, and did their fork earlier.

People were naysaying from 2013.
The people that didn't are millionaires now.
Do you really think $90 billion market cap in Bitcoin is a bubble?
Facebook is worth $500 billion.
Did you know Facebook will be rendered obsolete when the social media dApps on blockchain tech take over? It'll be a long time, maybe 10-15 years, but that $500 billion will evaporate and the crypto space will be worth 10+ trillion by then.
If you understand the tech, you will understand there is nothing like it in the world. And there never has been. People aren't exaggerating when they say this is the new internet.
The only difference is, if you chose to ignore the internet all you missed out on was information. If you choose to ignore bitcoin, you will miss out on "the greatest financial revolution and opportunity we will see in our lifetimes."
That is not my quote btw.

I remember buying bitcoin by depositing cash into some guy’s ATM from localbitcoin, put maybe $1000-$2000 in.
Couple months later I meet up with a guy from localbitcoin and he gives me $30,000 for not even half of what I had bought originally.
It really is a surreal experience. You think “lol digital monies, it’s not real”, then you start handling way more cash than you ever would with “real” money. That’s the biggest part to make me go “huh... this is pretty legit.”

Yes if Namecoin had smart contracts, then they would be bitcoin powered smart contracts.
Are you retarded?

Bought it 4 months ago in a private resale. The actual private sale sold $250 million in a very hush hush ICO that 90% of crypto users never even heard about.
It’s gonna be huge.

If there’s one thing Satoshi didn’t have, it’s bad design decisions.
The decision to leave out Turing-completeness is what I’m assuming you’re alluding to, but he was already bringing a paradigm shift. No need to try and cram smart contracts down people’s throats at the same time.

I'm actually working on a solution for this, as part of my side project.
Smart contracts are not being used to even 20% of their potential at the moment. I think all the would-be devs just ICO'd all their ideas, got rich and dropped everything to party 24/7.

Internet is not like bitcoin.
If the internet went down for some critical vulnerability and people’s data was stolen, literally everyone would still use it the next day.
If bitcoin went down for some critical vulnerability and people’s money was stolen, BTC would flash crash to double digits.

The DAO rollback nearly killed Ethereum at the time and only succeeded due to Vitalik’s cult like status at the time. I was there. It is not possible to replicate with Bitcoin, or even Ethereum today.
Landscape was different back then.
