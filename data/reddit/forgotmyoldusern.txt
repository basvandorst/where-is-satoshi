Did not want to write this beforehand as this is possibly just a rumor. But there is quite a talk that winklevoss twins dont actually own as much bitcoins as they say (not even close to be more precise) and they only played the whole community to become some sort of big time gurus. Not that this is the main reason the ETF is not going to happen...

Its complex I think, Ill name a few : people think we found the bottom, a lot of good news around development of BTC (VC investments, coinbase, EU cash registers, bill gates comments etc etc) , EUR/CHF fiasco, QE of EURO, Greece might exit EU and shake EURO stability really hard. And I quess a few more

@_date: 2017-02-11 17:47:47
Well in my eyes, wouldnt it be miracle to get consensus of 95% on anything? Iam sure if you have referendum that every single person in country will get 100$ a month for free and it would just appear out of nowhere (not cutting into tax budget), you would still find 5% who doesnt give a fuck about 100$ and fuck it up for everyone

One would think people would rather hold btc then CNY when you have some money on exchange that is being audited

Who in his right mind is gonna short BTC now? I mean even during that dip it was fairly obvious it wasnt gonna crash hard. Seems like we have few of these swing ups and 1/2 correction back ahead of us. Its way different what it was during mt.gox days.
But then again maybe he is just gambler daytrading and playing 10-20$ swings 
@_date: 2017-01-08 09:39:59
To be honest bitcoin is very new still (for them at least) IMO they just want to make sure that they are not gonna fuck up by approving it. So they they will delay it as much as possible to have everything figured out. I dont think there is anything else behind it as I read some wild speculations. 
And they have been kinda right though, can you imagine them introducing bitcoin few weeks ago? and it swing +25% and then drops it in a span of day?
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:46:40
etherum shill!
@_date: 2017-01-02 08:58:29
Yeah its a lot like propaganda that is put into your brain, It will take generations to die or some crisis lead with hyperinflation for them to understand.

So can we have a stake in this somehow?
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:08:18
That would be very stupid if you think about it (not if you just want to sell with profit and get on with your life). If we can come back to price that was pretty much manipulated and pushed by huge bubble and with 30% less liquidity it should tell you where the price is heading 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:29:35

Who use this stupid exchange anymore? I have a little story about them too. If you know what CLAM is and how does it work you will understand how stupid this guys are.

If you have even 1 cent with them you should really move out ASAP.

They are actually using the good part of ripple and what it should be used. Ripple itself is good but the greed of the owners kinda fucked it 
@_date: 2013-06-11 01:31:04
Resent and Pmed you! Thanks for answer here 
@_date: 2013-10-03 21:52:48
This is ex btc global, they had to rebrand for some reason. 
@_date: 2013-10-05 11:54:57
Hopefully they put it back online really soon, 7th of October trading at BTCT stops and security threads are mostly only direct communication with shareholders. If bitcointalk is still offiline during the shutdown It could create huge mess.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:09:56
So one might say you are bitcoindigger ? ;]

Can you order these amazon drones with it?
@_date: 2013-05-17 11:56:57
Besides they would probably need private power plant maybe because of this ? 
And they would need double that and if it isnt late today tomorow might.

@_date: 2013-07-12 20:06:24
Again, I absolutely agree with you. Then again you are forgeting he is guy who was investing into BTC when it was really low and has 3 big businesses under him (coinlenders,input.io,btcinvest) so he probably has plenty to gemble with but as I said before It didnt help him to show he has a gambling side to him.
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:46:44

What if bitcoin rises to 1000$ he still doesnt make profit on them ?
@_date: 2013-05-06 09:54:46
What happens when you find out that you have old wallet that has some small amount of BTC. They are untranferable? This must be case with many wallets around the world. Shouldnt be there solution for this like 1time tranfer under 54.3uBTC?  or merging balances with other wallets ?
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:13:10

Yeah they are about to launch one in about 2 weeks !
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:10:44
I think it was right as they annouced it yes. 
@_date: 2013-07-31 09:23:09

Bitcoin, bringing volatility to real world!
@_date: 2013-07-25 09:48:06
You just might, there is a rumors that the price will drop to 0,6 soon and whoever bought @ 1BTC will get another for 0,1BTC. Lets see if this will get confirmed first though :)
@_date: 2013-08-20 23:25:53
2 weeks. Oh you said mt.gox, dunno...
@_date: 2013-06-24 22:47:49
Use bitstamp their deposits and cashouts with SEPA are suprisingly fast.
@_date: 2013-05-04 11:31:17
As much as this seem likely, you never know... In poker community we were saying the same thing about next poker boom when it hits china. It hit chine multiple times and nothing really happened. And bare in mind Chinese people probably have closer to card games than some crypto currency stuff

Mark Zuckerberg told them
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:28:03
So if he had 10000 transactions that would sum it up to 10BTC would that still be problem to send?
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:58:13
And how would you know that? There wasnt any 100k+ btc tranfers and there is not a lot of people who own that much BTCs. They had to be paid most of the value in fiat 
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:55:01
My list of banks that dont want bitcoin to succeed looks like this :
1. every single bank on this planet
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:53:32
This is why bitcoin will not crash to anything really low, because everybody thinks that when it falls under 10$ they are gonna get as much bitcoins as possible and get rich that way :)!
@_date: 2013-05-07 10:11:28
Maybe he in the `ol reddit safe !
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:33:53
Will there be One billion zimbabwian bitcoin :) ?
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:01:00
Iam so getting pissed by this "leave mtgox" posts so much... I am stil waiting to my verifcation there, but meanwhile people suggested me BTC-E and 24btc so i deposited on btc24 which we all know how ended ... and now Iam reading BTC-E is unsecure and I should not deposit there. Yeah I understand its not good for bitcoin if mtgox has such a monopoly but they are only good/secure market by far. So what do you expect from people when other markets just keep failing in some way and beeing only on 1/2 of traffic, ddosing they would crash instantly and would take them weeks to fix
@_date: 2013-05-16 12:45:25
Oh wow bitcoin is not volatile for few hours? SOMETHING FISHY IS GOING ON !

I sent you a bit coin. Now young man where do we meet for the actuall thing ?
@_date: 2013-06-05 10:33:34
What are you crazy ? HW wallets will be one of the biggest steps of bitcoin community. Its probably one of the safest ways to store bitcoins offline without having to deal with paper wallets,change etc which are so non user friendly to non tech savvy people. Most people are afraid of using bitcoins because its hard for them to understand, can you imagine how much easier it would be to just hand them one of those USB wallets that is pretty much safe and super easy to use ?
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:26:32
What is testnet?
One more question when you epty out paper wallet, is that wallet done or can I reuse it ? I quess that would be kinda pointless but just wanted to ask 
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:28:12
I recived mine after 2 days. But I still have some euroes in some BANK limbo universe since I had deposit on the way and its not on btc-24 neither did it come back 
@_date: 2013-05-14 10:18:00
Iam sure this is already on someones mind or even hands but what about some offline HW wallet that would have only 1 way transmiter of your bitcoins and you couldnt break into it unless you have access to that device. Just like a real wallet 
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:17:14
Where are the treads about 40 guys not calling it right though ?

Can you actually invest into avalons IPO somewhere ? All I could find are shares in mining rigs 
@_date: 2013-07-12 09:37:39
there are way better trading funds than this thing, and with much more trusted person running it 
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:58:52
Pre order buyers helped to fund one of the key things that might get bitcoin mainstream. I gladly did it and do not regret it at all. It was expected with more and more adoption but people are just getting into bitcoin to get rich and forgeting the real matter.
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:33:28
It didnt really fall due to "ridiculous news" . It fell becuase people are stupid enough to buy some shares without studying the security and then sell them in the same day with 50%+ loss, after reading some stupid FUD. There is not that much shares sold actually so price will eventually bounce back (probably not at the wall price). 
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:08:16
Go for gold! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:04:09
And many probably did.. but thank you for beeing a nice person !
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:56:34
At the end is that a bad thing? Who is losing money on market manipulation? I am not  really into trading and market stuff but arent only bad speculaters/traders losing in this situation, poeple who invest into long term or just using bitcoin for their personal use are pretty much intact by this. So by the time these people get broke and market will be more stable.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:03:56
One of the best things to do with your bitcoins is paying with them for stuff online or find places that accept them in your city/country.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:21:35
Thats some specific number to write "for over" so is that 5976950?

They are actually very usefull for decentralized minig economy
@_date: 2013-07-12 10:46:19
BTCinvest on bitfunder for example. But do your due diligence before investing into anything. I dont want to adivice anything 
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:21:07
I would stillpay it for that little thing though... Not like ivestment but like fun and security thing. If lets say 10% of all bitcoin users would have one you could add a lot of security hashing power to network if necessary. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:13:49
Exactly my thoughts I would invest portion of my btc into this easily. Lets hope makers can see this and re-evalue this option !

From what I understand other coins are kinda made for pure profit of the creator I.E.  litecoins which milions of them were pre-mined/mined by one user. And that is kinda bad and sketchy

@_date: 2013-05-10 13:25:09
And can you send bitcoins more then once to that papar wallet ? But if you want use any coins of it you need to send it as a whole or import it into my bitcoin-qt wallet (by doing this I also avoid the change stuff right?)

Absolutly not, that would be completly fine. Ripple is not open source and they are giving away XRP to whomever they want for doing nothing.

Oh, from the caption I though you would tell us that its first time you see how full of shit US politicians are when they are talking about something you understand :) 
@_date: 2013-07-12 18:58:13
Well I was thinking absolutly the same, but then again he did it publicly and was open about it and said it was his own BTCs. And the point was raised in his security thread so I quess he will not be doing it again and Iam kinda over it because he would probably be doing it anonymously if he was gambling some one elses money right ?
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:19:04

Seems like there was atacks on exchanges that offer alt-coins too. I dont know this for sure but I was reading chat box on crypto trade and their admit said that a lot of sites are down and that they were under atack too but it did nothing as they have some big network behind them or something...
@_date: 2013-07-14 15:57:33
How do you know they will not some AsteroidCoins there ?
