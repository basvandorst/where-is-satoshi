So basically OP is a bad consumer for not wading through endless volumes of marketing materials, comparing apples and oranges in order to find a suitable banking service.  Then you get to repeat this process with any additional financial accounts (second checking account?, savings.. have you heard of the savings account activity fees???, brokerage, insurance services)... why, you almost need a full time assistant to wade through all this information just to not get fucked over (no guarantees that you wont in the end).

Yes I do agree that it should be open to everyone, but not such that everyone can store their personal data on the blockchain.  The network capacity should be reserved for the most important data (e.g. money).  My whole point is that increasing the theoretical capacity of the network at this stage is putting the cart before the horse.  We don't understand the network dynamics well enough to charge forward this boldly.  I'm an early adopter, I love technology and the internet but I personally believe migrating slowly is only an advantage at this stage.
Transactions should not be free and the network should have sensible resource limits.  Appropriate limits will make the network more accessible to users with fewer resources (slower internet, less disk space) though we don't want transaction cost to be so high that only the rich can use it or that it would only be used for high value transactions (e.g. title transfer for a building).
There probably is a happy medium where there is just enough scarcity that it remains accessible to those with modest computing resources and transaction cost is high enough that it dissuades "spam" (however that is defined by the individual I suppose).  Currently, there is more than enough capacity such that the cost of bloating the blockchain is zero.  We aren't even close to this being a real problem.
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:29:54
I still don't understand this fixation on transactions per second.  No one has ever promised the bitcoin network would guarantee any amount of transactions per second (what about a sudden drop in network hashrate, are consumers going to potentially wait in a store for hours) or compete with the likes of the big consumer payment processors on the *one* metric/feature of transaction volume (ignoring the other advantages of crypto currency).
Transactions can still be sent today with no-fee and are confirmed quickly (I tested yesterday and my transaction was confirmed in the very next block, just as if I'd paid the usual .0001 fee).  We might already have a "blockchain bloat" problem.  Until transactions require a fee for fast confirmation and until the miners start ignoring no-fee transactions, the increasing average block size is happening because there is no economic incentive not to keep sending coins around.  When I first got into bitcoin, there were cries throughout the community that satoshi dice was clogging up the network because their service generates 2 transactions for every "bet" they process.  If we allow the network to grow with the current cap in place, the economics *should* drive lower value transactions out of the network.  This is where we reach my limit on the understanding of economics and game theory as applied to networks so I'm definitely open to deeper thoughts on the matter.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:38:49
The resource constraint is necessary so the blockchain doesn't fill with non-essential data, the system can support large transaction volumes today, much of which aren't paying transaction fees.

@_date: 2015-01-07 21:50:09
Yes, this is the bitcoin use-case, you control the keys to your house (your identity and your finances).  The scheme for these types of financial accounts is that you give a 3rd party the keys to your house and hope they don't get stolen by another 3rd party.  Its fundamentally different and inherently more secure, when you know you're safe, if you've follow the right steps (best practices) to secure yourself and your funds.  Buying insurance for identity theft is a bandaid on a systemic problem.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:28:41
Thank you for expanding on this, I really feel like this obsession with TPS is missing the point.  The bucket metaphor is good, but it also implies transactions might get lost if they don't go into a block right away.  They stay in a queue of unconfirmed transactions and are removed from that pool and put into a block based on priority, priority can be influenced by transaction fee.
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:16:55

Regardless of the capital investment, the mined blocks do in fact need to be verified and accepted by the majority of the nodes on the network.  The capital investment is at serious risk if the blocks being mined are on an isolated chain (orphaned blocks) if a miner decides they are going to start mining blocks according to their rules which nodes do not accept as valid.

Just want to point out, that today, you can send transactions *for free*.  So the difference is between not paying a fee, and including a nominal fee.  Longer term, there could be supply/demand dynamics that lead to floating transaction fees (meaning that yes, sometimes it costs a little bit more to send the same amount of value as a less busy time).

The 1 MB cap is high enough that transactions can be sent with no fee; this means that today, blockchain bloat has no cost (the intent of the limit was to address transaction spam).
Certain members of the bitcoin community look at metrics such as # of transactions per day as a useful measure of network growth.  If transactions are without cost, these metrics are meaningless.  If transaction cost is free, the network utilization we see is not high enough to justify changing anything at this point.

It boils down to the market-based solution being more ideal, which is just my opinion.
Larger block size is a protocol change.  Protocol changes are tricky business.  It is extremely difficult to evaluate the true nature of code changes to the network dynamics, and there is no getting around that.  Protocol changes *always* introduces risk.
In this case, I don't believe there is sufficient benefit that pre-fork consensus can be achieved.  As funny as it might sound, the less risky (market-based) solution to this "problem" personally gives me more confidence in the system.  Yes, it is an experimental system but that doesn't mean we change the protocol every year so we can keep on innovating.
The internet would be unusable if HTTP introduced sweeping changes annually.  The majority of internet traffic is using the second iteration of HTTP (1.1 which was codified 15 years ago), it was created with the assumption that the TCP protocol would not be introducing breaking changes upon which it relies.  Now we're talking about a money protocol and we want innovators to build on top of it.  There is a bit more at stake with the bespoke technology (money) which has centuries of history and expectation of consistency.  I think big changes to the protocol are going to happen in the world of alt-coins, and Bitcoin already has too many stakeholders that value protocol consistency above protocol reimplementations or innovations.
In the absence of consensus, the only alternative I can see that could possibly work are the market-based solutions.  Of course, I don't want to pay more than I have to, and recently experimented with zero-fee transactions (pleasantly surprised to discover they still confirm in a reasonable amount of time).  We shouldn't fix it if it ain't broke.

It is not proven that "the network" (with its human and non-human participants) can "handle" 20MB blocks.  All that was proven is that in a limited test scenario it worked.  These blocks need to be propagated quickly, to all nodes of the network and stored.  Consider 10 minute blocks, 20 MB block sizes for 24 hours (2.88GB), 1 week (20.160GB), 1 month (604GB).  Nodes in Africa, from a wireless connection, need to download this dataset!  There are serious doubts in my mind this scalability is sustainable.
Regarding spam specifically, I don't want spam (or people buying drugs) transactions filling up my disk space, though if the fee has been paid I know rational users wont be sending a transaction unless its meaningful and worthwhile.

The beauty of open sourced software is if a developer decides they don't like how their software works they can fork the project and users can decide to adopt the fork or remain with the original.
No one is holding a gun to anyone's head and forcing them to work on this project and realize the "original vision" as you state, although to me the original vision is that this protocol was created into existence with certain parameters which offers certain guarantees surrounding certainty and unimpeachability within an otherwise hostile environment.  In other words, the code stands as it is and users will simply not accept changes to the rules of the road this late in the game.

Bitcoin's adoption *is* following the history of successfully adopted internet protocols.
We don't use token ring network topology because ethernet emerged as the defacto winner, adoption followed the "hockey stick" growth pattern and it was only a few short years after it emerged (first experiencing outright rejection by the technology establishment at the time) it's growth rate told the true story (it was a better technology, and therefore was used in favor of the other available solutions).
Far too little is understood about network dynamics and value for casual comparisons of any kind, so in this way I agree with your point and its good that you're forcing people to think through the argument.  I'm not entirely clear what your intentions are with all of your trolling efforts, but it seems like in the end we will have a better educated and more skeptical bitcoin community which further strengthens the movement, so my imaginary investment thanks you.

I'm impressed that you've come to the table with an idea for a solution.
I've seen very little dissent and less rational discussion on why not to arbitrarily increase the arbitrary block size limit.  Often engineers are so focused on mix/maxing that its hard to see the forest through the trees and this change makes me really uneasy about the strength of the system.  Unfortunately, I don't have good alternatives to suggest as you have done, but I genuinely want more people to understand the implications of doing something like this.  I've been trying to imagine a scenario that could illustrate the value (or risks), maybe some type of hardware device that implements the rules of the protocol.  If such a device was designed around the assumption of (approx) 1, 1 MB block per 10 minutes, it would be more obvious that changing this "parameter" could be more disruptive than it seems.  Then again, why would someone design a hardware device with such limitations?
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:28:57
No, it is a misperception that the miners control the rules.  In fact, each node independently verifies and transactions and blocks it receives and if they don't match the rules of that node, it is discarded.  The decision making power rests with the nodes, a miner has an incentive to mine blocks that will be accepted by the network.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:16:22

Demand pricing for transaction fees.  We can already do this, no protocol change required.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:28:51
Think about how the demand for money varies wildly (and how transactions will happen in waves) based on how it is used in the economy, reaching a block size resource constraint is going to occur intermittent occurrence when it happens until the network is far larger than it is now (at that time we might see frequent congestion periods).
Bitcoin already has a mechanism to address this - transaction fees - paid to prioritize a transaction when fast confirmation time is desired by a user.  There are many examples of this mechanism in use to ensure "equitable" access to public commons - from toll roads/lanes, bandwidth caps by ISPs.
In addition to miner acceptance of any changes, there is a real risk that incompatible protocol changes that do become adopted could undermine confidence in the bitcoin network.  There are plenty of alternative means of achieving more transaction volumes but at no point is increasing the block size the only or even best solution to this problem.  Building consensus is a real challenge, and I agree that sooner is better than later, but I'm afraid its already too late.
Bitcoin trading happens for what it is today and a lot of users (with lots at stake) are already invested in the idea that the rules of the system are fixed (if you can imagine how people might react to increasing the 21 million coin cap, you are starting to see how this change will be received).  How the system works today is more important for the price than what it can hypothetically be (even with all the speculation).  Addressing hypothetical problems with protocol changes is bound to hit an iceberg.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:15:10
I was using transaction rate and network size interchangeably, but it is the transaction rate we are talking about.  Increasing minimum system requirements is going to push participants out of the network; increased block sizes will have that effect.  As others have said, the miners are selling scarce block space, and this proposed change negatively impacts the network incentives.

There already exists a split in the community, a hard fork is a tough sell.
I don't believe the "trust-less" retail transaction is an idea use for Bitcoin, which has to do with reasons besides block size limit.  The time between blocks is both long and erratic which make it difficult to predict just how long you would need to wait for confirmation  (plus, how many confirmations does this merchant want? 6?).  It promises "eventual consistency" not instant permanence.
I see the uncertainty surrounding from a different/opposite perspective.  Introducing any change to a software system introduces the risk of unintended consequences.  We already face this trade-off with new features and a protocol chance such as this makes the project feel much less stable and like more of a science project.
The standard is already high that the system be secure because of the fact that money is involved; money that is favoring more systemic stability and not less.

I think this is why there's been so much controversy over increasing the block size cap.
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:08:12
To be clear, this is a theoretical scalability concern.  I'm still sending zero-fee transactions, and they are still being confirmed in the next block - it is still possible to increase blockchain bloat for free!

@_date: 2015-01-08 21:29:36


The ship has sailed, the market cap is already in the billions.


Absolutely, let us check.


Pretty sure the growth of the network is one of those foreseen events that was given much consideration.


Ship has sailed, we have consistency to lose we don't get consistency with more protocol changes


Agreed (had to double check this isn't buttcoin for a second hehe), everyone wants a brighter future, but like many things there are different ideas about how we proceed and change needs to be inclusive and respect the network incentives in place today.  Because of this, introducing a new feature and losing that attribute of consistency puts the system at a disadvantage here (opinion).


Don't conflate floating fees with the system being broken.  Obviously no user is going to pay .01 BTC to send .001 BTC, the miners are competing with each other and this puts pressure on the fees being efficient and fair.  Transaction fees are what makes or breaks bitcoin, as it is the only incentive to mine in the future.  Undermining the scarcity of blockchain space and the value that scarcity provides WILL break the system.
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:55:32
Actually it seems that the IRS wanting taxes from him is the justification for "border protection" actions... We can't have people *not* paying their taxes, because if people realized there was no *requirement* to pay them, why, it could undermine the house of cards we've fought so hard to build in 'murica!

Copying bitcoin is the metaphorical double-spend.. you should know this.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:00:13
All the more reason to encourage the development of the organic tx fee market.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:30:46
Yes the bottoms are increasing, and this is a good problem to have and I've never disputed we start seeing more and more blocks which reach their maximum transaction/size capacity.
The system was designed so the transaction fees would incentivize miners as block rewards continue to fall, right?  *This* is the market-based mechanism intended to prioritize important transactions over the no/low fee transactions which will be queued and mined during periods when demand falls under the block limit.  There will be daily fluctuations where during periods of high demand, transaction priority drives what transactions are confirmed first and during the non-peak "off hours" when volume is lower, the queued transactions will be confirmed.  This is the lowest layer of the stack and I don't think monkeying around with block size, and the implication for the lessened reliance transaction fees (in favor of reliance on increased system requirements for full nodes).
So how do we resolve the "transaction per second" argument?  Simply, the bitcoin network capacity doesn't need to support the need for all humans on the planet to transact directly on the blockchain with *every* transaction at every moment of the day.  Transaction fees.

The only thing that matters from the point of view of a central bank is confidence.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:43:24
As far as you're concerned, the only source of truth that matters is the longest chain that matches your node's rules.  And this is the case for all users.  If you are sending your funds to another party, the rules of that party's node would be relevant to the outcome of your transaction.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:32:05
It playing with the incentives.. Its not unlike.. changing interest rates or printing money.  I think we want to get away from this as a society.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:16:23
It will probably also lose its status faster and harder than we expect.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:14:48
I have sent many transactions *without* fees and even during busy times, they confirm with, at worst, a delay of a few blocks (using medium priority outputs).  Also, miners don't have much to go on when evaluating a transaction for "nonsense" with the possible exception of dust transactions, but aged outputs and outputs of larger quantity are given confirmation priority.  So a determined attacker can currently add bloat with no marginal cost.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:18:13
Yes, priority consists of both age and size of an output.
@_date: 2015-04-04 19:30:39

You don't need to pay fees though, you didn't before and as evidenced by non-full blocks, you don't need to now either.

You are right, there is nothing stopping you from attempting a transaction of that size while standing in line at the coffee shop.  Do you need to wait for your transaction to confirm before you get the goods?  Does a roughly-every-10-minutes (but sometimes an hour or more) confirmation time work in this scenario?
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:54:42
As soon as I discovered I could send transactions without them I promptly stopped.  I'm hardly the most informed or savvy, but I do believe the underlying factors that would lead someone to intentionally bloat the blockchain are still the same as they were before.
