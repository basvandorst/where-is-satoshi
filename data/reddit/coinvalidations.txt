All we see it the same 40 people stomping their feet.    
It is hardly an obstacle that we need to be concerned about.    
For every one of downvotes there is a dozen who agree, and like us, aren't concerned with votes.

That's a valid argument, but not exactly what we're discussing.    
Whats your rational for people openly selling child porn, reddit only a few clicks away from it.     
What about the funding of terrorist organizations? Let me guess, not real and just government false flag attacks?        
What about human trafficking, illegal arms trade, murder for hire, etc?     
Do you have a "not my problem" justification for all this? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:18:56
But you don't have an "s". So you only have one validation, but we'll have several government approved validations.

The best thing for the Bitcoin Community is to regulate itself, while keeping governments informed, that way there is no need for individual states to regulate the system.    
It is the spirit of self governance that we are working on a Coin Valadations system.  This system will be 100% voluntary and will unite bitcoin users, businesses, and governments in a way that is acceptable for all.     
* A whitelist of known and registered addresses.    
* International Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Client compliance     
* Working with the core developers to integrate Coin Valadations protocols into bitcoin.   
Our goal is to make this as behind the scenes as possible, once integration with bitcoin wallets are complete you will instantly know if the funds you are about to send are going to a registered account, likewise you will know where funds you received came from.   With the automated alert system, you don't have to do a thing if you received funds from an unregistered address as that will be recorded by the Coin Valadations system. 
The great thing about the system is it's voluntary.  It's simply a way for legitimate users to band together to take a stand against drug dealers, pedophiles, and terrorists.       
Won't you join us?

People here love to blast banks that engage in fraud, money laundering, dealing in its criminal cartels.    
It's sad that a vocal minority of you don't see that with Valadations even those banks couldn't have done this.     
Bitcoin on its own doesn't prevent the fraud that is brought up daily here, but Valadations would.   
Try and be HSBC when all that drug money you are taking is marked as such for the world to see.     
The future is here and Valadations is part of it, it's what governments want and what bitcoin needs.

What I've noticed is that you want to completely derail the discussion to another topic, because when pressed you don't have to valid foundation for your statements. 
We are discussing people voluntarily joining together to oppose actions they believe to be wrong.     
If you don't want to part of that group fine, that's the great thing, no one is forcing you too.      
But don't try and convince people that what we are doing is wrong because you hate your government. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:14:36
So you hate the government for supporting the *criminal* cartels who you in fact support, because all the are doing is producing and distributing plant byproducts?     
You are aware that most designer drugs (meth, oxy, etc) are chemically produced in labs, and are not plant byproducts right? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:43:53
You have a numbered account now, with a bank. That bank has your identity.    
Each bank note has been serial number of it.    
I suspect you use your bank account and cash?     
So what's the difference? 
@_date: 2014-01-01 20:41:53
People will use Valadation because they want to know where there money is going and where it comes from.    
Public works, politicians, banks,  could be audited by anyone, anywhere, at anytime.   
How is that not good? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:12:40
So your argument it that Bitcoin shouldn't be a better currency than fiat?    
I'm confused, everyone hates the money laundering, cartel supporting banks, but at the same time fight the implementation of safeguards into bitcoin to prevent this behavior. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:24:59
We are quite serious, sure we have a ton of negative Karma, but who cares.    
Our goal is uniting the people who are using bitcoin in a legitimate and legal way, not win the reddit beauty contest.    
All the people crying about their "freedom" forget that we are not proposing to force registration, and officially oppose that idea.    
This vocal minority is simply downvote us in an attempt to censor our voice, by preventing us from partaking in the discussion.       
(reddit prevents users with negative Karma from posting, but once every 4 minutes)      
Yet these same people woukd cry bloody hell if they were censored.

If you think they might be stolen, remember to send them through our service. We'll pull all the compromised btc out and return the clean, validated ones to you. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 19:18:42
This is only a temporary problem.     
Soon, it will be easy to identify bitcoins originating from questionable sources.    
At which time you will be able to quarantine these transactions locking them from being spent.     
This would remove the possibility of you Validated account from being tainted by this behavior. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:08:24
The rest? 
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:08:42
It's simply going to be impractical for people to "opt out" of the registrations and validations process.      
People need to get on board with the changes, as these changes will secure the acceptance of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:02:56
As a point of correction you did forget that we added retinal scans to the list. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:38:31
I hope it's obvious to people that you are just trying to scam them. This address won't receive validation from our service, and by posting a transaction to it you are in fact linking your address to this one.   
Be safe and only use Official CoinValidations approved addresses. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:58:45
Don't forget about me, I want the central end and the teamsters unions. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:10:41
It will be simple to track stolen coins once the address validations start.   
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:23:01
We have a solution to this problem as well.    
Once all addresses are identified and have their validations, it will be trivial to see who is inflating the blockchain.    
A limit on how many kb you are allowed to add to the blockchain over a period of time will be established, and once you've exceeded your limit your Tx will be "backlogged" until they next cycle starts.  
Please don't listen to all the misrepresentation and lies about our organization. As you can see, by centralizing the blockchain it becomes safer for everyone. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:05:56
I would respectfully request that you remove this comment and in the future refrain from engaging in lible.   
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:18:47
No. People don't want to use merchants that are fronts for money laundering and terrorists.      
Actions speak louder than words; and by not validating your identity and/or business you are clearly taking a pro-terrorist position and deserve to be boycotted. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:36:35
We understand everyones hesitancy to embrace Validations.   You all feel like bitcoin is yours and you don't want to shoddy group of bankers trying to steal it, we get it.      
But if you sat down and thought about all the benefits Valadations would offer the community you would see that we are trying to bring bitcoin into the light, and make it a global force to reckoned with.       
Will this require some centralization? Yes.     
Will accounts be authorized, recorded, and watched? Yes.       
But no one is talking about Black Listing accounts or funds, we are doing the exact opposite; we are White Listing accounts and funds so that businesses, and the average consumer can be assured that the funds and people they deal with are legitimate. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:09:54
Are you withdrawing from a CoinValidations approved address?    
After MtGox's past issues with US Regulators it stands to reason they would be extremely careful regarding where they send money.   
Best to validate during the voluntary stages, so it's clear you have nothing to hide; before the blacklisting begins. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:11:33
Right now it can be a potentially tricky area: Amounts of transfers, frequency of transfers, etc.   
Once the validation process starts, it will be as simple as making sure that adress you are sending funds to has validation and let us handle all KYC AML issues. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:39:47
Boycotting any merchant that submits to our service would severally hurt our profits, as such I would respectfully request that you instead only support merchants who have our validation. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:12:59
Obviously not, and that's why all transactions not originating from and going to a CoinValidations approved address should not be distributed by nodes. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:08:48
The simple truth is that once our government sponsored validation protocols are in place your won't have to worry. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:22:57
No problem Alex, just trying to help.   
There is so much misinformation out there. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:21:24
We thought of that, and this technique won't fool the system. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:58:31
That's because you haven't gone through the validation process. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:28:46
Why? What are you hiding, money laundering, terrorist connections, child porn.    
People like you are what's wrong with this world.   
Validations will bring bitcoin out of the darkness and into the light. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:22:13
Nope, there are several troll accounts with similar names as ours trying to discredit our work.
