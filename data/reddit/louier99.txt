Don’t worry people bought bitcoin at its peak of 19k. You’ve got nothing to worry about buddy�� just be patient and let the magic happen. Keep it safe and leave it aside and you’ll be surprised
@_date: 2018-10-18 09:50:34
In terms of what? Exchanging? Viewing graphs? Etc 
@_date: 2018-10-18 10:03:54
If I could recommend a app for viewing crypto portfolio, prices, graphs, and signals then blockfolio is the one to get. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:47:40
Link one in please 
@_date: 2018-10-18 05:05:36
As in Fiat??
@_date: 2018-10-19 11:47:55

Twitter and Reddit

The private key is never online when plugged in. Which means it’s never connected if that makes sense
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:03:57
Cold storage by far is the safest and most secure option out there and in my opinion the easiest to use and manage.
I use the ledger nano S. it’s a great little piece of tech that I can use to help me sleep better at night due to knowing my private keys are always offline.
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:58:12
Where can I purchase these? ����
@_date: 2018-11-05 13:17:18
The fee won’t get smaller 
@_date: 2018-11-29 07:10:46
I’m thinking mid 2019
@_date: 2018-11-05 11:41:33
Not that I know of 
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:22:12
Looks good. What languages did you use to code it? 
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:56:50
Bullish 
@_date: 2018-11-05 11:42:41
It’s 2 euros I think 
@_date: 2018-11-03 22:34:21
Settled out as in not going down no more??
@_date: 2018-11-02 00:28:11
Enter your public btc address you made the transaction from 
@_date: 2018-11-02 00:22:06
I’d leave it a few hours. If no luck, contact g2a because the only place it would of gone is to them 
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:29:19
Ive downloaded Armory wallet and i have the same problem of it being offline due to not having the DB. You have to download bitcoin core and link the files to the Armory wallet to be able to connect to the blockchain. If i was you and since you are new to this i would stick to a more simple wallet and it is a wallet i have used before and had no issues with and it Exodus. Very simple and easy to use with a good interface. I would of still been using a wallet like Exodus however, i recently bought a Ledger Nano S. As good as they are they come at a cost.

Been up all night thinking about it mate
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:35:51
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:24:17
Do you mean BAKKT?
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:10:45
Let me download this wallet quickly. Never used it before and Il let you know 
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:04:34
Is it synced to the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:30:07
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:03:38
Bullrun incoming 
@_date: 2018-11-02 00:27:49
@_date: 2018-11-02 00:17:59
Should arrive due to it being sent to a specific address for BTC payments I believe 
How longs it been?? Transferring BTC isn’t quick 
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:43:21
@_date: 2018-11-02 12:37:44
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:08:00
Okay so every time you load your wallet it will need to sync to the blockchain to gather your transaction history, wallet value etc etc. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 11:22:02
I personally use coinbase 
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:36:29
I use coinbase a lot
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:36:14
I do apologise I misread it��
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:56:54
Buy a hardware wallet eg ledger nano s which is what I use and its great����
@_date: 2018-12-06 09:54:25
Start taking out smaller amounts first 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:18:17
I know of arbitrage. I’m asking if that’s why he keeps it on there 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:36:20
Who is this message addressed to? 
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:33:29
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:46:51
1.2k btc and not a ledger cold storage wallet in sight 
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:19:55
Yeah it’s a website. You can pay for a premium version which gets rid of ads etc but its not really worth it IMO 
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:20:28
Just hold it till you are 18. Prices will rise eventually and you will be glad you did hold it now and sell later than selling all now. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:55:17
.4 use TradingView to view graphs for technical analysis 
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:10:26
The price difference?? Price difference between exchanges? 
@_date: 2019-05-19 08:45:44
Need to lose the emotions. I’ve been holding most coins since the end of last bull market. I’ve seen my portfolio drop a killing. But I’ve just held and bought more in the mean time. ��
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:52:54
Unfortunately they have so much control over funds on the exchange :(
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:20:51
No worries!
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:52:23
You need ID for coinbase 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:20:56
It’s not really his money on an exchange. Yes he is the one who bought it but it’s not in his hands. It’s in the hands of the exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:09:52
I wouldn’t either. I could imagine hitbtc etc doing that 
@_date: 2019-05-22 18:33:52
Not wise.��
