Merely a minor setback. Also it won't be a loss in a few months! My Litecoin more than makes up for it even while it is down.

No doubt I'm hodling. Can't wait to see where we are at years down the line. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:46:53
It's more the fact that it shows up first, and it scares the newcomers/potential adopters away. It's not good information if someone new is looking to learn. If I didn't know anything about crypto and had trouble differentiating good sources from bad, I sure as hell would not did deeper if all of the scare tactics were in my face.

Good point. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:58:37
Good point man.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:54:27
Hodl or die, whichever comes first. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:43:16
No, I've been holding LTC since it was 80. And got in BTC around 15k. I'm not even remotey upset about this BTC downtime. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:21:15
As a Litecoin and Bitcoin hodler, I can't wait for the shitcoins to die and the funds to come rushing back. 
@_date: 2019-07-19 16:30:50
Stop, I can only get so erect.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:20:23
Make sure she knows it's worth
@_date: 2019-07-19 20:57:43
We're gonna need a bigger gravestone.
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:06:23
This is good lol
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:32:57
I mean there are risks anywhere. What am I supposed to do as someone that wants ease of use? I use 2FA and store my coins off the exchange and app. Same goes for your bank, that shit can be hacked too. Can't be scared of everything.
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:09:36
This is great haha
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:40:53
This is good lol
@_date: 2019-02-04 14:52:11
Thanks, I like these pieces. Look forward to seeing more.
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:39:01
It already is, it just takes time for people to realize that.
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:30:16
Shit, looks like we aren't that far away with the rate things are going.
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:28:07
I was very entertained by the comments. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:16:09
We still go two years.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:17:25
I know right? Only 1M? I say 10M. I'll eat 5 dicks if not.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:32:58
The less than own it now the better, more will adopt in the future, imagine the price if we even get close to 30%
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:21:40
This is just manipulation in the opposite direction. People are just going crazy because it happened so fast.
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:18:04
Let me tell you, it's the fucking future now that we can say that.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:42:23
I agree with this. However, in my case, I have LTC that I bought before the big bull run before the new year that doubled my investment. I could take out my initial, but it could be worth so much more if I didn't. I could afford to loose, it as much as it would suck. The key is not investing more than you can afford to loose.  
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:40:27
I am good with that my friend. And we wouldn't even need to sell at that point. We can use crypto as the currency it intents to be.
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:22:39
You know what they say... "The man who loses money on shorts, didn't get a good deal at Old Navy"
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:52:09
Lol it could change 25% the same hour it's printed. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:02:28
I really hope he knows something we all don't. This seems steep, but definitely realistic.
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:00:07
That's a good thing. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:34:07
That's actually awesome
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:11:40
Doesn't bother me at all because I'm in LTC
