@_date: 2014-02-27 21:36:24
When you are expecting a transaction to come from a specific entity you know their address because that's where your coins came from.  Because of the whole Gox debacle users were collecting addresses that were known to be used by Gox to send them transaction which they could then go into the Blockchain to see if there were addresses that would indicate they were owned by an exchange.  For example if they were sending out a large number of transactions daily. 
In your case your exposure is going to be with the merchants you interact with but this is no different than using any other form of payment with one exception.  If they know your address then they can see any addresses you sent to and if these addresses are known to be linked to certain organizations then outsiders can see that part of your spending history.  
If you use multiple addresses without linking them buy shuffling coins between them then you can maintain anonymity.  For example, I sell on LocalBitcoins and keep my wallets separated by at what price I bought them at for tax/accounting purposes but because I use the same address on localbitcoins if someone were able to link one of my transactions to me then they could plausibly link the other addresses to me.  
Plausibly is important, for example in the Gox case the only addresses we can know FOR SURE that are controlled by Gox are the ones they told us they own either through giving us the public address or sending coins from it to us.

You can go back in the chain of inputs and if you get to a Gox wallet then the answer is yes, only if the transaction occurred after Gox halted withdrawals.

That makes sense.  You face a lot of risk by going into a new space like this especially if you have other business areas already because due to legal action they could be threatened.  If the DOJ decided they wanted to throw the book at you using an obscure law from the 20's then they can.  With a clear regulatory framework you can operate knowing what the rules are.  The danger for existing businesses is that they don't know what the rules are going to be and the attorney general can still prosecute once they decide what they are.

Turkey is playing all sides in the region and they can get away with it because Anatolia is the most strategically important landmass in the world.  Whoever controls the Bosphorus controls the Black sea, they control much of the flow of energy out of the middle east, and allow the US to project power by allowing US bases inside.

The real economy backing Bitcoin is person to person drug trade since that's really the only commerce that benefits from it at this point.
Before the speculative spike last fall we traded around 128 USD/coin so with 11 million coins and a 'market cap' of $1.4 billion.  A lot of these don't move so that skews the calculations a bit since they are either lost or long term holding.  But anyway, a economies GDP will be about 2-5 times the amount of currency units available.  (I'm basing this off the SEK since other currencies are not well managed or also used extensively in international trade, although I must note that SEK does not use an official reserve rate so it makes calculating the total amount of currency units difficult due to reserve fractional systems)
Based on this the BTC drug trade generated between $.5 billion to $8 billion in terms of economic GDP last year (most likely somewhere in the $3 billion range).  Given that the global drug trade is about a $320 billion industry, this doesn't seem infeasible.  
This of course doesn't include your enthusiast types, and gamblers using the system.

"Are you aware that there were ads for bitcoin on the government channel only 6 months ago"
"and all of a sudden bitcoin is a threat to them"
People sometimes lose track the fact that large organizations are made up of people with sometimes competing interests.  BTC runs counter to China's centrally planned economy, specifically their currency export controls.  So when somebody finally figured this out, they took steps to shut it down.  The ban has been clumsily carried out because of the massive bureaucracy of the Chinese government and their banks.  The exchanges will continue to try to find ways to operate because capitalism.  This is one of the few times I've ever seen Chinese policy really butt heads with a capitalist enterprise, it will be interesting how this ends.  
A historical example for a large organization like this is how the NSA handled DES versus when the NSA told people to modify a standard and it was found years later that without the standard that under certain conditions it was vulnerable to certain attack vectors without the modifications.  (I'm having trouble finding which standard it was, it's been awhile)

Bitcoin is a hybrid commodity/currency which nobody has any authority over which allows users to communicate economic value to anyone, anywhere in the world, nearly instantly, without a bank or processor and with very low fees.  Transactions are cleared by network of computers competing against each other which makes it very difficult to subvert.  Since the rules of Bitcoin are determined programmatically it does not have some traditional risks associated with national fiat currencies like corruption or local economic shocks.  Additionally, the use of public key cryptography offers users privacy that in some ways are better than cash.

There may be some interest from investment bankers since sometimes I'll see Turkish in the BTC-e trollbox.  
I'm not really sure how BTC could play out there since the tech literacy is all over the place and the tax put on imported phones doesn't help.  As an additional comment to the tech literacy, when the government blocked Youtube and Twitter there was a movement to get people using alternate DNS since the sites were only blocked at the DNS level for most of the ban, I left shortly before this happened but it's something to take note of.

If you have ever used metric then you know how meters can scale up to kilometers (km) and grams can scale up to kilograms (kg).  In common usage meters can also scale down to centimeters (cm) and even further.  Currently Bitcoin division is limited to 10^-8 or .00000001 due to decimal precision of the data type used, this can be increased in future updates to clients.  At present this places it between the nano and micro prefix.  If one BTC = 500 USD then 2 mBTC (milli bitcoin) = 1 USD

Nobody really disputes that.  If the value trends up quickly then people will hold on to their "investment" then when it stabilizes it will flow as a currency again.  Then if it goes up we will repeat.
If it goes down then it is a market correction.  Adoption seems to be difficult to reverse, the jury is out on China ATM but a fair amount of coins entered the country and can now be traded P2P.  
Since it's there is a fixed amount if adoption is fixed but productive output increases then purchasing power increases but as more people adopt we will see an increase in demand that will drive up the value artificially temporarily before a correction.  
Admittedly there is a problem introduced by speculators entering the market which drives up demand then day traders come in and try to make money on price swings but you can't control these people.

Get a blacklight.  The security strip in the $5 bill glows blue, the $10 bill glows orange, the $20 bill glows green, the $50 bill glows yellow and the $100 bill glows pink

If we want to go full tin foil hat then the CIA/FBI/USSR/KGB/Mob/Rothschilds all conspired to kill JFK.

I have an AAXA LED pocket projector that I used for my dorm room.  Other than the fan noise I have no complaints, though the subwoofer tends to drown it out.  I'd imagine actual entertainment system projectors have better heat management. 
I think mine is only 110 Lumens but I used blackout curtains and it looked fantastic.

From my understanding in the US you're gonna need a team of lawyers, some coders, very security conscious IT guys, and massive balls since the regulatory red tape isn't exactly clear yet.
Also getting a money transfer license sounds like fun for the whole family.

I briefly worked in infosec before I decided it wasn't for me but from my limited experience I would NEVER trust an online wallet for large amounts since when you mix a zero day and irreversible transactions you expose yourself to a lot of risk.  The motive is there, the capability can be made, it just becomes a matter of time before there is a break in.  Companies much better than the online wallet startups with less to lose have been compromised.  Exposing that many assets is just dangerous.

DAE have a mancrush on Elon Musk?

Er, none of these were endorsements except Childish Gambino.  The closest after that was Ashton but that is just his VC fund gambling on a startup.

If I was going to guess, I would say he mined a little bit in the early days.

I'm an American temporarily residing in Istanbul.  If capital controls here are any indication of the rest of the region then you are going to be fighting a long uphill battle.  This is especially true since many of the areas economies are protectionist either to encourage firms to locate themselves inside the state or protect local industries.  The BTC system has the intrinsic capability circumvent these systems and this will not sit well with governments.  Though you seem to be aware of this since you've addressed a similar obstacle in the UAE. 
The learning curve can be addressed with the correct forward facing software platform.  Much like people don't need to understand TCP/IP to use the internet people should not need to understand public/private key crypto to use BTC.
Good luck

I think it's government protocol to dump evidence once they are no longer required to hold it but this case has some extenuating circumstances and anybody telling you what is going to happen to the coins just doesn't know.  The minimum the FBI has said about the entire thing makes it look like they don't know what to do with it quite yet and if they have the authority to.

Is it not trivial to add a, "Cash will be verified as authentic using blacklight" to an ad?

After what happened to encryption technology and with the way the FBI handled the Kevin Mitnick case back in the day, Im surprised they're so... accepting of the technology.
