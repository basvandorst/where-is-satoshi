Their servers might be a little overwhelmed. You can't do anything until you're verified, so I would keep trying to click the verify link until it loads. They might send you an email once you sign up, so check your spam to see if they have and if there is a link to follow, (I don't recall).
Also, I think you get 'Tier 1' status just by providing your info online, which allows you to deposit and trade crypto. If you want to deposit and trade/use dollars, you need to send them a copy of your driver's license and/or residence to get verified for Tier 2, I think.

Kraken.com allows you to margin trade up to 5x leverage on your BTC. Just be sure you have a solid cushion to allow for price swings, or you can take a bit hit when/if you get a painful margin call.

Yes, that should be no problem at all, (I do, and am also in the U.S.). Also, you'll note that while you can trade most popular coins, you can only leverage the primary ones, (like BTC, ETH, etc.).
Again, leave enough 'equity' when/if you margin trade so that you don't get wiped out if there is some short-term volatility.
Also, when you sign up they have different verification 'tiers' that affect how much you can transact. The more personal verification info you provide, the more you can transact. Good luck!

She could have had it for a song.

Also, Kraken trading software is still a little slow, and orders don't always go through. They are supposedly upgrading in December. The beta charting feature is quite good, however.

The max you can leverage on Kraken is 5x. I'd suggest starting out using only a portion of your available equity, and margin 2x or 3x until you get a feel for it. Resist the temptation to go 'all-in' when things are popping. As you get more comfortable, I always keep enough margin in reserve to allow for a 40% pull-back. Also, as you grow, consider keeping some BTC, ETH and Cash so you are never fully exposed only to one asset.
