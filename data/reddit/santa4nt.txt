Hi. Are you new to humanity?

I think his point is that the Bitcoin market is not (at least currently) efficient. Hence, the plausibility of your acquaintance's claim.

Honestly not sure if we should expect better from a company called "Magic the Gathering: Online Exchange"
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:46:16
Right. It's easy to eyeball between **0.0001** BTC and **0.00001** BTC than between **1,000** mBTC and **10,000** mBTC and not accidentally spend 10x as intended.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:39:50
Nexus. It's a Google experience phone that is sold without contract. It's also their developer reference device. So the device itself is completely unlocked. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:07:51
Which begs the question, why the hurry?

You don't actually backup/store the coins per se. What you store/backup is the *private keys* that allows you to spend those coins. The "coins" themselves are just numbers on a public ledger of balance sheet that are distributed across the network. That is, everyone has a copy of the records how much coins each address holds. 
So yes, if you lose the backup, you lose your keys. If you don't have the keys, you can't spend the coins. And no one else can, either. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:14:40
Or make the QR code part of the art! 
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:35:58
One would hope had his keys backed up. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:04:56
Wouldn't that result in a fork, since clients that are in the minority would just reject the blocks mined by the majority because such rule-breaking protocol changes would cause their clients not to accept the majority blocks as valid?
@_date: 2014-04-05 20:30:31
The system is self adjusting such that generation rate is more or less constant (as a parameter of the protocol that can be changed,  by the way), no matter how much total power is used. 
If generation rate depends on power, everything will be in constant chaos. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:37:39
You're missing the last rule of backup: always have one copy offsite.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:26:38
So THAT's what it stands for! I thought it was a mountain or something.
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:29:27
Because Google bans bit coin apps, too, wat? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:52:03
Nexus. It's as close to pure Android experience as you can get. No bloat, full developer options. It's the reference design for an Android phone, after all. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 01:33:15
I think milli- is a natural name for it, given that most of the rest of the world is already used to the SI system. They are already used to switching between m and mm (millimeter) or between g and mg (milligram), for example when dealing with small quantities. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:43:04
The problem is that it is easy to lose track of zeroes.
We can quickly distinguish by eyeball the difference between $10,000 and $100,000.
Not so much with 0.00001 BTC and 0.000001 BTC since there is no convention around partitioning fractional zeroes.
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:02:54
That's not investing. That's gambling.

Can't he just run a twitter bot, then? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 22:55:19


You don't even need to do that. If you control a private key of an address, you can just use that private key to sign a message saying "I, &lt;insert cred id, e.g. username, here&gt;, control this address." No need to waste bytes doing meaningless tx.
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:52:09


proceeds to outline steps most people will glaze over.
I think you grossly overestimate the technical knowledge of the general population.

I think it's all about the tipping carefreeness that they do over at You get to do transactions a lot more often, and it helps solidify your knowledge and comfort about how to do so and how crypto currency transactions work.

T-Mobile does not equal Android. Just saying...

So... "this is actually good news!" ... ?
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:53:55
No. AFAIK, you realize the gain on the first BTC, and your second purchase only establishes a new cost basis. 
It's similar to rules for trading stocks.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:36:10
"Clears" his name? What's so bad about developing Bitcoin that being thought of as inventing it is a slander that needs to be "cleared"?

How do you realistically use and remember 100 different passwords for 100 different things you're guarding, though?
(Unless you're using a base password with permutations related to the things you're protecting, but that's less secure than 100 totally random passwords).
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:26:26
You can always return it if you're not happy with it. It's unlocked, so get a prepaid, like $10 T-Mobile SIM to try it out.

Seems like the obvious solution is for Coinbase to implement some sort of access control. Say, generate another API key that is read-only that you can safely hand out to Mint.

A good app would disclose what algorithm they use to encrypt your private key, so that anyone with the skill can "recompute" your private key with the given passphrase without access to said app.

But not unique to Singapore.
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:57:12


Because the nature of BTC is deflationary. 1BTC today is worth less than 1BTC tomorrow in a deflationary model. So, if you lend someone 1BTC and get 1BTC back next year, you'd get your "interest" because that future 1BTC has more purchasing power.
@_date: 2014-01-02 23:46:48


I'd go for my totem and make sure I was still in the "real" world.

Well, that's because your money in the bank is insured.

Isn't the backup also AES encrypted? Did he use the same password for the wallet and the email? 
@_date: 2014-01-29 01:30:10
Right. But with fraction there is no useful convention around zero grouping. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:51:11


@_date: 2014-01-09 07:26:28
Um, no. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:38:22


then you'd be as dumb as the guy who carries $3,500 in paper bills in his wallet today.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:53:26
That's not a fool proof strategy. Addresses on a phishing email can so easily be spoofed.

Even a signature doesn't do anything. If Dorian is he, what's stopping him from *signing* a message from Satoshi saying, "Dorian is not Satoshi" (aka lying about it)? 
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:56:26
No, that's an incentive. The main function of it is to verify transactions and continue the blockchain that contains the public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions in the network. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:46:31


Shortly, the blockchain protocol.  What is marvelous about Bitcoin is not the "coin" itself. That's just the first useful "app" for the enabling technology that is the blockchain protocol.
The ability of the protocol to solve the [Two Generals' Problem]( is what was discovered by Satoshi, and it had never been disseminated before.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:27:41
Ever heard of the economies of scale?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:00:56


Only if those coins are lost and would never be spent ... ever. If they really were stolen, wouldn't the thieves want to spend them somehow?
Now, if mtgox somehow lost those coins by accidentally "rm -rf" the private keys or something....
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:52:20
By then we should probably agree to a smaller unit, and rename 1BTC to 1kBTC or something.
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:32:42
You do realize they both have the exact same underlying protocol? What is a problem for one is a problem for the other.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:38:16
If you're already used with SI, it won't bother you as much, I don't think.
SI users are already used to interchanging **m**, **km**, **cm**, **mm**, etc. Additional decimal multiplier shouldn't bother you much if you already use SI a lot.
