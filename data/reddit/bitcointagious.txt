Liquid is an arrangement between exchanges. If they deem it worth paying for, that's none of our business. RBF reiterates that trusting zero conf transactions is poor practice and always has been. Transaction fees are critical to maintain the Bitcoin network. SW is a substantial optimization with broad consensus that solves transaction malleability, reduces transaction fees, has a multiplicative effect on block size scaling, and enables *real* scaling solutions to be deployed. Sidechains are an experimental testbed for new blockchain technology. Your tinfoil is on way too tight..

Your mistake is thinking that zero conf is a feature. It will be widely broken the moment someone releases a malicious double spend tool and it's a mistake to teach people that zero conf is acceptable.

@_date: 2015-12-25 23:17:35
We've taken zero conf for granted, but it was never intended to be relied upon as much as it is now. The 'next stop 1 conf' theory is unlikely because it's far more difficult to double spend a confirmed transaction. Common knowledge considers 2 confirmations to be very safe, and 6 confirmations to be bullet proof.

This is getting pretty far into tinfoil hat territory. RBF is a natural evolution since double spending zero confs is so trivial. Liquid is an inter-exchange sidechain that's not going to be open to everyone. Lightning is completely open source and anyone can participate. The profit incentive there is extremely low for the foreseeable future. The Core team is pushing Bitcoin to evolve to the next level. Users will need to evolve too.
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:38:25
My reply pointing out that they only mined one block in the past 2 weeks and their lead developer left got 20 downvotes. THAT speaks volumes.

@_date: 2015-12-27 00:07:18

@_date: 2015-12-02 11:28:40


100% true, no matter how inconvenient it is for you to hear.


100% true. He said he will do the bare minimum to keep the repo functional, but that he would no longer develop it or promote it. That "something else" is a private blockchain intended to help banks compete against bitcoin. Gavin specifically said he doesn't want to take over XT. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 12:39:17

If Lightning provides a cheaper and more secure method of instant transactions as opposed to insecure zero conf transactions, then what is your objection exactly?

'Attack'? Nice propaganda. Your coup failed. Get over it.
@_date: 2015-12-14 06:46:07
Your options:
* Pay the miners a reasonable fee to process your transaction
* Start mining your own transactions
* Go use a less secure network.
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:21:42
You literally JUST said that bitcoin adjusts. Nobody said bitcoin was free. All of this infrastructure costs money. Are you denying that bitcoin needs a fee market to survive? 
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:28:00

Bitcoin doesn't work without miners, and miners won't work without a profit motive. The subsidy won't last forever. We need to get used to paying them transaction fees to secure the network. If that isn't good enough, stop using Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-12-23 13:45:43
Why the condescending insults? What you just wrote won't scale. $10.00 per block isn't sufficient enough to compensate the miners, and even if the network could cope with 100x the block size, it still wouldn't be enough.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:12:53
You could, but probably just for bulk savings. Daily spending would be done off chain in this scenario.

There is no 'last block' until bitcoin dies. You mean the last block with a block reward, which is about 120 years away. After that, miners will keep mining and collect transaction fees.

@_date: 2014-09-16 19:02:45
The hrivna has fallen against gold nearly 90% in the past ten years. The dollar has fallen 70% and the euro has fallen 60%. So, the hrivna, the dollar, and the euro have been on a downward trend for more than a decade. Bitcoin has been on a downtrend for six months. Bitcoin will regain that 40% against the dollar sooner than any of those three currencies even begin to exit their own downtrends.
In 2010, one ounce of gold would have cost you 25,000 bitcoins. Today, it costs about 2.6 bitcoins. If I were Ukrainian, I would be buying gold. If I were an adventurous Ukrainian, I would buy bitcoin too.

The fact that bitcoin rustles your authoritarian jimmies so badly is this week's reason for me to make another buy. I might even spend it on... *marijuana*. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:00:58
It's sold in BTC and the price is pegged to $120 USD. The purchasing power of BTC has fallen since the product was released.
When released, the BTC price was $600, so $120 = 0.2 BTC.
Now, the BTC price has fallen to $400, so $120 = .3 BTC. The difference is psychological if I rebuy BTC right away.

I just want to make sure you know what self-censorship actually means. It's when you refrain from speaking your mind in fear of repercussions. If OP was having doubts about bitcoin but refrained from posting his doubts out of fear of downvotes, that would be self-censorship. But if people are just downvoting his post because they disagree or whatever, that's not self-censorship. You could argue that it's just plain 'censorship', but downvotes really aren't censorship. Fact is, is not 'one pulsing brain'. I'm really not seeing this blind optimism you speak of. I see skepticism and uncertainty every time I visit.

That must be why he signed the roadmap, is preparing for SegWit, and promoting a soft fork.

They probably overestimated the impact it would have and called it quits when they realized they were just giving free handouts to miners. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 10:11:35
This is where Mike, Gavin and the Core developers all put their egos and petty grievances aside to figure out something that works for everyone?
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:57:51
To me it says that Mike is more interested in starting his own coin than in working together to scale bitcoin. He's the one person who needs to be there to present BIP 101. If making his case is a "waste of time", that's all I need to know about Mike Hearn and BIP 101.
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:15:55
Both protocols are just moving bits of information around. Should we put a tax on speaking too?
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:39:00
The majority of the miners have voted for BIP100, meaning BIP101 doesn't stand a chance without a major overhaul. As Gavin demonstrates here, there's no room for compromise.
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:42:53
There isn't. They're just very noisy. People were spamming XT everywhere even though it could literally split Bitcoin into pieces and create a new altcoin. Theymos decided it was was offtopic and the spammers went crazy.  Now that XT failed they just run around vote brigading. Like this comment.
@_date: 2015-09-04 08:54:12
If we don't support Mike, that means we don't want Bitcoin to be successful? If I wanted to destroy Bitcoin, I would do exactly what Mike is doing.

That's because Jeff is doing things the right way by getting consensus for his proposal first, then writing the code for testnet, rather than wasting everybody's time with a proposal that will never get consensus.

These analogies aren't working very well. The point is that 75% of miners is not enough to decide such a delicate upgrade, because there's also the other 25% of miners to consider, as well as everybody who doesn't mine.

The warning will appear immediately when the transaction is received, before the confirmation. It's a couple lines of code for wallets to detect RBF transactions. If you're buying coffee, don't opt in to RBF. Nothing changes.

I would agree with you if it weren't true. Mike and Gavin used their influence to stir up a mob against the developers and the mob was easily misled at almost every turn. Eventually they'll catch on to the fact that they were played like a fiddle.

You're complaining about having to update your own infrastructure which is based on beta software? Maybe you need to find a new line of work. The mempool has already been processed, so mentioning it is just FUD. Not to mention that RBF hasn't even deployed yet, just merged.

Nobody is saying the community owns anyone. Mike's situation is quite the opposite. He's caused so much damage at this point that people want him to leave and never look back. He is poisonous and his conflict of interest can't be ignored.

The wedge issue is bitcoin scalability, more specifically, block size. A developer has exploited this once-united community by drawing a line in the sand and saying "either you want bitcoin to scale, or you want bitcoin to die". A lot of people fell for it and helped the developer drive a deep wedge into the community. Now people are waking up to how much damage has been caused. We must grow stronger and wiser.

Not even remotely. RBF is opt-in, doesn't require a hard fork, and will not overwhelm the network or bloat the blockchain. It gives users some recourse when their transaction gets stuck, and people shouldn't trust unconfirmed transactions anyways. This is an important step.
