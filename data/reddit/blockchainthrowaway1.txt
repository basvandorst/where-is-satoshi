To be fair I've been around the Bitcoin scene for a while and there is no perfect solution
- Old Wallet.dat from Bitcoin Core: Yeah how many people lost those files or deleted them or thought they were useless? Too easy to misplace a file.
- Blockchain.info: Bad passwords or misplacing backup files = lost coins
- Gox: Need I explain?
- Exchanges like Bitfinex: Inevitably some password heist results in massive losses.
- Deterministic wallet: Pretty good, but honestly phones get lost, seeds get lost.
- Paper wallet: lose/misplace the paper, or store it at a bank (and thus the feds have access?)
- Hardware wallet: Trezor doesn't seem very good for daily use, but you need to remember to keep your with you. If you lose the wallet you're still ultimately stuck to going back on a seed... in which case do you order a new wallet now or do you use a BIP39 app?

I agree, a HW wallet is definitely better. Thank goodness BC.i reimbursed everyone for the PRNG issues.
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:54:59
I store all my coins at Blockchain. I know it's high risk but if you know what you're doing it should be fine.
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:55:20
That is true, but you're also certain to at some point in time lose your phone or lose a piece of paper backing up your seed. There's risks in everything we do.
@_date: 2016-08-31 08:44:07
Risky! I'm known as an idiot here for having 100% of my funds on Blockchain.info but at least I have control of my private key.
With BTC-E they could straight up disappear tomorrow and you wouldn't be able to get your funds any more.
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:02:44
Do you need to buy another one though? My understanding of a Ledger Nano S is that you get a BIP39 key. Sure you may lose your wallet, but you can recover your funds via Copay, Mycelium, Coinomi, and any BIP39 compatible app right?
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:03:58
A PIN could be brute forced though, no? Which is why I'm always skeptical about hardware wallets. It's a physical item that isn't protected by significant entropy. In many ways you're better off with the wallet seed yourself.
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:18:17
The point to emphasize is there's risks anywhere. Your phone could be compromised, someone could be looking over your shoulder, etc.
For most people who are competent with computers, being compromised by malware or a keylogger is very rare. I have yet to see one documented case of someone's Bitcoin being stolen with a keylogger.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:51:36
I know people shit on me for having 250+ BTC stored in Blockchain.info but at least you are in control of the keys there.
**Edit:** It certainly is high risk, but if you understand how BC.i works, it's not that bad.
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:58:31
Is your new HD Wallet based on BIP32 or BIP44?
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:45:00
2FA only works for site access to download the wallet file. Your wallet file is only protected by its main password (can someone with Blockchain.info expertise comment on how the second password works?) That means if Blockchain.info were ever hacked and its encrypted wallets were obtained, then your wallet would only be protected with its password.
This is why you need a strong password regardless of 2FA.
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:55:54
Oh I don't dispute there are more safe ways to store Bitcoins as there are serious risks with BC.i. However it's important to understand what those risks are rather than running around with like chickens with their heads cut-off as much of does. 
I Jaxx based on BIP32/44?
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:34:27
It's not recommended because misuse leads to lost funds, but let me just say this--the important part with any service/software is to understand how it works. If you don't have the time to figure out how exactly Blockchain.info works and how to secure your funds, **don't use it.**
With that said almost always the cries of lost funds typically comes from these users:
- Those with shitty passwords
- Those with wallet backups in their email accounts or sprinkled in places they can't control. This is less of an issue if your wallet is encrypted with a STRONG 16+ character password.
- Those with poor security practices.
It is possible to use Blockchain.info safely. For instance I have 200+ BTC still there. I know people think I'm insane, and sometimes I am worried, but trust in the system if you know how it works. Also every time you upgrade the security of your wallet, you should consider sweeping the funds into a new address because old backups still can access your old addresses, and if Address A was created when your password was "123456," it doesn't matter you've upgraded the password because if that backup is floating anywhere, even in Blockchain.info's own servers, someone could get ahold of your funds using password "!23456." Sweep it into a different address.
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:48:55


But you see, that's a problem whether or not you control your own key. If someone can't be trusted to manage their data on Blockchain.info what makes you think they will keep a paper wallet safely? Or a wallet.dat file safely? There's tons of talk about people losing wallet.dat files, hard drives crashing, etc.
I'd like to reaffirm that I didn't put my funds on Blockchain.info to show off to the world that I have nothing to lose. I did it because back in 2011/2012, Bitcoin was worth very little and it was a great online service at that time. Over the years, I've re-evaluated and just upgraded my security at Blockchain.info to ensure that I don't lose funds.


That probably is because I only access my account from time to time and don't do much spending if any. But weren't most users reimbursed by Blockchain.info from the RNG bugs?
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:55:36
I've considered it. But I think I'd probably resort to one of those HD mnemonic seed wallets today if I were forced to move my funds.
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:51:34
While you're right Blockchain.info isn't safe compared to the alternatives, I just wanted to dispel the myth that somehow Blockchain.info = lose your coins. If you practice good security practices, you should be safe. I've combed through enough threads here to see that typical instances of lost coins on Blockchain are a result of user error or poor security practices on the user's end.
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:53:22
Fair enough.
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:49:37
You can say that about the most secure form of encryption too. It's always a matter of when.
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:52:21
I've posted this before, but I didn't do this in order to show off to the world. I did this because my funds were there since 2011/2012. Over the years I've just upgraded my security at Blockchain.info to ensure I don't get hacked (2FA, sweeping funds into new addresses, etc).
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:53:06
That is a very good practice, and honestly if I magically came across 200 BTC today, I'd probably store it differently.
These were coins from the MtGox era, and I chose at the time of 2011 to put them into Blockchain.info
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:57:55


You are correct. It's similar to the whole Wallet.dat management. Don't lose your hard copy.


Absolutely BIP32 and 39 are excellent choices. Unfortunately Bitcoin wasn't as mature enough in 2011 to have those options widely available. My storage choice was merely a product of what was available back then. I should've probably swept my funds over to something safer, but yeah....
To properly secure a Blockchain.info account you must assume that backup file could possibly fall into anyone's hands. The most common errors I see people making are:
- Having old backups stored improperly.
- Changing a password but not sweeping into new addresses. Your old backups with bad passwords allow you to access the private keys of the same addresses. So it's fine to realize that you should upgrade your security, but make sure the old keys are dead.
- 2FA activated, but not on email. Everyone should recognize email is one of the biggest gold mines. Even if sites are properly encrypting passwords and no longer emailing plaintext passwords, the fact that someone can gain access to most of my accounts by getting into email tells me that email needs to be secured. Bitcoin losses definitely suck, but there's no telling what else you could be losing due to email accounts being compromised.
In the end yeah, it's a risk I take. I'm probably an idiot or whatever, but I'm also fairly confident unless Blockchain.info is compromised with malicious code to steal my password, my wallet is kept pretty safe.
@_date: 2016-02-26 01:14:08
I do have 200 BTC+ stored in Blockchain.info. Hasn't been a problem yet. Good security practices go a long way.
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:55:04
That phishing site didn't even work :(
Why a throwaway account? Why not?
Why do you want to find me? So you can apply some [rubber hose cryptography techniques](
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:51:36
I don't doubt there are better solutions. However, when done right, Blockchain.info can be used safely. Here's what I've done in my case:
- Enable 2FA: duh
- Delete old backups and disable automatic emailing of backups
- Enable a second password (not sure if this helps if you have an offline copy)
- Any time you change your password for Blockchain.info, sweep your funds to a new key. This is to prevent the backup from being accessed. An old backup is still valid with the old addresses, and if it has a weaker password, that is your weakest link. If your new backup has a strong password, then having your funds in a new address means that no one with the old backups can access your funds anymore.
- Use the Blockchain.info client and if you must use a browser, use Incognito mode.

Sorry, I didn't realize this post actually went through. Why? It's not because I moved it there so I could get all my funds stolen. I had them there back in 2011/2012 or so when it was unclear how to hold my funds.
I did contemplate having it all in wallet.dat, but was unsure of a secure system to manage it. How many cases of lost wallet files do you see around here? Far too many.
I did it because Blockchain.info at that time was probably the best online wallet service to use. As Bitcoin gained popularity through 2013 and we saw tons of losses, I made sure my passwords were secure, added 2FA, and made sure to delete old backups. It's more a matter of ensuring you're protected. Most of the losses of Bitcoin associated with Blockchain.info can be prevented with simple security measures that most people neglected to follow in the first place.
@_date: 2016-09-02 07:18:26
Probably GreenAddress or Blockchain.info. Although keep in mind there are probably more secure ways to hold onto funds.
Blockchain.info is fully client side encrypted so your keys are never visible to the service.
@_date: 2016-05-30 09:18:13
Fixed. But doesn't change the fact that my funds are secure. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:31:20
Once again a useless benchmark people keep pointing to eh? Value of gold/oz and now ETF volume?
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:05:53
I think what's better for you at that point is to figure out how to get out of the country. Holding Bitcoins does you no good.
@_date: 2016-05-29 19:56:56
Everyone should invest in a safe wallet I agree. I have done my research and have had 250+ BTC in my ~~Blockchain.io~~ blockchain.info wallet since 2012. No issues. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:33:38
Honestly it goes down for maybe 20 minutes tops. I see these threads and usually when I check out Coinbase it's perfectly fine.
Is Coinbase ideal if you do a lot of trades? Nope, but I'm going to bet most people have no issues with it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:16:51
It's not, but most of those cases where coins are stolen are because people:
1. Used terrible passwords
2.  Got their email accounts compromised where they had key backups.
Blockchain.info was the first mass market online wallet. Obviously there are people who fail to secure their coins. One can make Blockchain pretty secure (2FA, second password), and even use the new HD wallets they have these days.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:55:50
After reading this, I'm in a similar situation here too. Have several hundred bitcoin from the mining days, have been hodling forever. At some point I do need to consider the possibility of cashing some out, which could be a six digit transaction. Would love to hear what you decide to do in the end and perhaps the results.
I'm ready to pay taxes so it's not like I want to dodge the authorities. In an ideal world I'd just cash them out and pay capital gains on them all, but like you I am worried the assets get seized, etc.
