The real question is whether it will correct right after or not.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:19:25
What about the satoshi's BTC? If you had that much would you just dump it whenever you think its the right time? 
When I was going to bed I thought that you were right about a big dip. But what we see now is a regular dip. 
Many people are waiting to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:22:46
Unless they own 1/2 of all btc they will not be able to short it so much.
Most of the people who say it will drop that much just want it to drop, so they can buy more . 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:58:10
6k? Are you insane? If drops there it's over.
Because there are so many buy orders waiting , that's it's impossible to drop so much.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:26:36
The unconfirmed transactions on blockchain would have a part on this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:34:41
Yes, the real war is not in the horizon yet. 
There are many hazards ahead, but I still think that drops of 40-70% is too much to handle and also its improbable because of the buy wall  waiting for a 20% dip at most

If miners go offline, how the network will survive? 
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:39:58
I came here to say that 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:36:24
Is bitcoin becoming a dogma and thus preventing innovation and improvement? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:33:46
Just wrap in a fancy package . Best is BW and laser printed. Also protect with plastic adesive
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:29:04
How this will play after the BCH upgrade at 13/11?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:05:11
Who knows, and what prevent them to do the same thing with BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:12:01
Do you think that we will have time to sell for 10k , and then buy 3x more bitcoin for 1k and profit 7k ?
I think we wont have time , It will be top fast for us 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:36:40
Lets pray for that with strong faith
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:00:34
Will this drive prices up more then the Amazon domains?

"innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards" 
Early adopters are the second stage of the s-curve

I'd wait to move bitcoin to your own wallet until you know more about It.
I'd hodl (not sell) bitcoin
I'd buy more and more on a schedule 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:24:40
Its funny but at the same time very serious indeed 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:24:40
If you are really a asset manager, you could come here every week and tell us what the big ones are thinking .
Because 5% of a big one is a hole lot If money.
We'd expect a bubble like the dot com, but It seems that bitcoin is not there yet.  When the big ones step out, then we will implode.
Of course It Will be like the dot com. After ten years It Will be profitable again. 
So please tell us more about the intentions and actions of the big ones.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:12:55
Do you think that we will have time to sell for 10k , and then buy 3x more bitcoin for 1k and profit 7k ?
I think we wont have time , It will be top fast for us 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:55:43
I know. But It seems like there are a lot more just trading 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:01:38
thanks. I thought that hardware wallet would be more than cold storage. That would be a hardware device designed for that purpose alone. 
But I dont know how much secure would be a hardware wallet. Many people are unable to take care of their own stuff. Is more secure against many on line threats, but its possible to break or loose your local data in many ways. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:08:06
It may be another bubble
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:31:31
No.. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:06:42
Bitcoin cash is involved for sure 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:41:35
Is this only a good thing? I know people everywhere entering bitcoin.
I am one of them. I know it for quite some time, but when I woke up to it (around 1 year ago), i did not have the money to invest. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:50:08
The issue are the fees. Too much fees over bitcoin and the mental calculation does not work.
We need to cut 3 zeros of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:38:33
The trading volume still low. When you you think it will rise? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:29:25
I hope it's get there in time. Look like it is 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:00:51
Is this something to really worry about? 
There are many people saying that the "processing" time is very long. Few people say they could withdraw fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:05:11
Who Will willing to trade ir buy those b2x? Will be actually possible to trade b2x to bitcoin? Even in a 10 to 1 ratio?
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:24:29
because its related to money. 
What is the reason of so many altcoins? just money. 
There are no real and actual use for those coins, just a way to profit 
Unfortunately, because this was the first goal. To have a new and better money 
The creators of bitcoin are now the lords of money and they are tooking from people that are buying bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:44:52
What If the miners decide to form a union and then press It like a form of strike? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:13:47
It will work, but the exact and better time is not now. It works because governments do this every now and then. 
And also, its involves almost nothing in terms of development. Just moving out a "point". 
Instead of 0.00000001 we will have 000000001  
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:09:35
Do you think its possible to drop that much again?
If It drops 20% , what are you going to do? Buy more fast? Or be scared?
Everyone will want to buy more. So It will get back up and up again
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:16:33
I wish I had a bot now 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:57:07
Its a good argument, but we cannot compare bitcoin to stock market.  The stock market is a closed system. Its related to a country economy.
Bitcoin is global. So when it crashes because of actions of one country, the others will see it as an opportunity for profit. 
What kind of market could hold on after a pull out from China? Bitcoin did it. 
But of course that psychological mood is crucial for prices. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:24:49
I ask the same thing
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:02:13
This is true, but its also true if you apply this logic to any other financial system. If everyone wants to cash out from the banks, there will be no money for all of us. 
The question is do everyone will want to cash out from bitcoin? 
If only "trades" (buy-sell) are happening, then it could be a scam. But if there are actual trades happening, then there is a backup. For actual trades I mean people buying real things with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:22:01
Thats the Idea, but feels better to own bitcoin instead of Satoshi. Satoshi should be what bitcoin is now.
And also its clear that the price still Very Very low 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:27:02
it bounced to 5600. Did you missed the train or it will still dip to 5200? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:02:23
how do you know that the mempool is clear? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:55:06
I see risen 165k now
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:20:21
I'm not sure what is a hardware wallet. 
I know that you can keep with you in many ways or leave at the agency.
Its like your e-mail. You can download or leave on line. Each one has their own riscs. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:10:29
I had this thought some days ago, but like we are at the second stage of the curve.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:38:14
How this could affect someone who has bitcoin now? 
This could drive the actual prices up or down?
In one year bitcoin will be like 20.000 not 8.000 . How the Future deal will be good for buyers and sellers? 
Do you think bitcoin will ever dip more than 5% begining today? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:13:37
I agree. What do you think about transaction prices? Bitcoin is said to be better than banks , but is more expensive 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:42:43
Do you advise a hodl to cash out right before the fork?
Or wait to double coins and then cash out? 
Or just hodl and wait for the uprise again? 
Or buy more if it fells? 
Do you advise someone to invest now and sell just before the fork just to profit from those days? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:30:21
I think It may never go really down again. The big corporations are coming. 
It will blow like never before 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:07:44
Couple of months , not years 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:57:03
That was what I was doing. 
But it goes so fast that 20 days was too much to wait. In past 20 days it went from 5500 to 7500. 
So I invested 100% of the reserved amount. 
Now I wonder if would be best to cash out that half, before or just after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:22:21
really? everyone was talking about it like it was such a big deal 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:53:13
There are deep falls after 1 , 10, 100, 1000 . Will It happends again after 10.000?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:12:38
Do you think that we will have time to sell for 10k , and then buy 3x more bitcoin for 1k and profit 7k ?
I think we wont have time , It will be top fast for us 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:15:18
Now you mean right now or before the fork?
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:01:27
Its not a bull run, its a bull trap
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:37:30
When will he realize that bch was the biggest mistake of his life?
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:22:56
Yes. O found that there is a open bot called gekko.  
Until everyone has a bot, It would be good to use It. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:10:28
If you have such money, why botther about taxes? Pay the Bill and enjoy Fiat.
There is no Free lunch
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:59:10
Would be good to know when will It drops
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:30:40
Why not both? At least until It reaches the mainstream 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:08:30
I was at same position and did asap.
I may buy a bit more If the price drops after the fork
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:20:53
It will reach. The question is when 
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:48:17
Some of those other coins. 
I know too little about bitcoin, but it seems that there are issues with blockchain growing too much and mining issues. 
Maybe it will be the first of the digital coin. I think that the governments and super rich will create or sponsor some new coin.
Until there we have to enjoy bitcoin as much as we can. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:27:39
Buy now or wait some more hours?
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:52:06
only 150gb? 
How it will be when it goes to 1.5TB?  
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:37:05
Can you give a prediction free trial first?
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:17:49
Buy and hold even If goes down. Then wait to get high again.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:01:44
Would be cool to have a Free bot (gpl) 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:11:40
The big question: do you want to buy 1 or less bitcoin. If you want 1 go fast for It. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:32:16
Those Lost will be gone forever? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:49:11
Ok. I bought it! now I have bitcoin! lets see if I will gain or loose in the next few hours 
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:46:10
But they could be Amazon and bitcoin could be Yahoo
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:18:20
That's pretty good crystal ball! Take a good care of it. 
I'm waiting for my money to be transferred to the bitcoin agency so I'll be able to trade. Unfortunately I does not have enough for 1BTC, yet... 
Cant wait to start trading
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:54:41
How many coins? If low , cash. If high pay the tax 
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:58:59
I know.. I had a small amount of money that I used for bitcoin and my plans are to hold them for quite some time. 
The only problem is the urge to buy more. It seems addictive.
I'm not sure if I will trade. I wonder if its is a known fact the appreciation before the fork and devaluation after it. 
And also how long it will take to start going down. 
Since I'm a newbie on this I think I'll just watch 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:42:21
I am aware of that. But It seems that there are a lot If people waiting for the downward . So even If It happends , the price will be high again. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:29:44
Very sad... But irá possible to recover If you buy more now. In 2 years you Will have It all again or even more 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:28:59
That tells a lot. I came yesterday.
Onde thing i dont get. Why ALL the New posts gets downvoted 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:27:26
Its just to have a complete bitcoin. Like your first milion.
