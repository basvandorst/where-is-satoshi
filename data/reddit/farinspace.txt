It will need some sort of easy update mechanism, else it'll age and become stale.

Although anyone can setup a LN, wouldn't the most useful ones be the bigger ones setup by the likes of Starbucks, Amazon, banks, etc ..

Isn't monero security also based on how long it stays on the monero blockchain .. the longer it remains in monero the more secure?

is monero the important part of these steps (ring signatures, etc) .. vs another currency type DASH or LTC (as their value have been holding pretty well)

my understanding .. since the btc blockchain is transparent .. if i send from coinbase to a different address two things can be assumed .. 1) I sent it to another address that i control, or 2) I sent it to a someone else ...
however the address i send it to may not have an identity tied to it, but as an outsider i can surmised that the sender (from coinbase) owns it since the amount hasn't moved or doesn't appear to be a merchant pool address

stay in bitcoin and hodl .. most if not all alt coins are scams .. find the "bitcoin uncensored" podcast and listen to that for a while.

 will only show your node once you are completely synced with the blockchain.
I'd recommend that you start a AWS or Digital Ocean instance with 2-4GB memory and sync the blockchain overnight (should be a lot faster), you can then rsync it over to the pi.
Use the following on the command-line to check sync status:

 I think this project is very interesting. I would really like to learn more and attempt something similar from your example.
I've been going through the code, and have been following along as best I can. I am trying to locate the heart of the learner where zenbot creates/adjusts its decision making data. Can you elaborate on this a bit more, the juicy parts?

currently the tezor and the nano s are good options

Hodl until things settle down, afterwards. Also take your coins off the exchanges prior to Aug 1st, liquidity may very well dry up.
