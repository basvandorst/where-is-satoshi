I would sure hope so. Lightning network seems insanely cool as long as on-chain transactions don't become so expensive that lightning network is the only option for every day users.
Unfortunately there seems to be a large resistance to increased block size, hence my concern

would bitcoin not be an empty husk of what it once was at that point? what happens when those bitcoin banks start requiring a drivers license/passport to do business with them, and then refuse to do business with anyone the government doesnt like, like how visa/mastercard/paypal have all cut off wikileaks?

Yea can't wait for bitcoin to become paypal with lightning network. I just love the idea of centralized authorities being able to unilaterally cut off funding to organizations like wikileaks!
Wikileaks hacked our election so this is great!!!1!11

honestly I upvoted you becauae you made some good points that have me possibly reevaluating my stance on the matter. However what happens if nobody but citibank can afford to run a hub because of $1000 on-chain transaction fees due to the limitations of 1mb blocks?

yea, or we can just become centralized with lightning and then we are visa/mc.  Hooray for no freedom!!!

channels can be one way or two way. thats the only one of your questions I for sure know the answer two.  From what I understand there would be a fee for closing a channel but I am not 100% sure about that. That fee could be quite high if the block size is never increased so all of this may end up happening where there are only channels to and from centralized authorities where many thousands of strangers all share channels from there

But what would happen if on-chain transactions got so expensive only big banks could afford them? At that point would there only be a handful of lightning hubs since running a lightning hub would only be proffitable at huge economies of scale?

I honestly have no clue whether or not it's FUD. I wish somebody could just explain in layman terms why we don't have to worry about lightning network becoming something where everyone has channels to centralized banking authorities and that's it.
