Well, according to Google, your article is very popular (and some features may not work).
I haven't read other comments, but that is good for you if you have any plan of action.

I think it's more about the hype than the news. Big news like Mt.Gox failing definitely impacted the market. There's no doubt about that. However, most of these ups and downs are caused by week-to-week traders who are riding the waves up and down and buying/selling at each one. Of course, that's only my two cents.
Check out [this post]( that is hot right now. The first comment better explains what I'm saying.

bubble's gonna pop (price goes way up super fast, then goes right back down).
I just sold 80% of my BTC at $422. Hoping to rebuy at the same price around $375-$380 tonight or tomorrow. It looks like I might need to wait longer. We shall see.
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:47:50
Good decision. I definitely think it's a good idea to buy now.
Also, that looks like CoinBase. If so, link your credit card if possible. You will be able to buy/sell as needed. However, this wouldn't have really helped in this scenario since you bought at a peak unfortunately. It'll bounce back up.

I agree. However, all of the three people I talk to about BTC are saying exactly this. They were set on buying at $400 - nothing else considered - until I argued your point.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:39:03
You get them instantly if you link a Visa credit card to your account, FYI. This does not make selling instant, though.

Where can I buy some??
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:08:40
RemindMe! 3 days "What price did I rebuy the BTC"
I've invested $2k total and I'm up $281 right now (including fees), with all of the money still invested (besides the 1.5 BTC I just sold). To be fair, half of that earned money is because I initially invested at $459 (after the intiial bubble, which turned out to be a perfect time to buy).
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:46:52
Any explanation? I woke up to $505, watched it spike to $523, sold at $519, and now it is at $512. This is very short term trend, but so far I've been right, and I hope to see it drop within the next 24 hours so I can reinvest.
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:01:33
The fluctuation, to me, is highly predictable when I rise like this happens. I tend to think many people think the same as me. I'm ready to sell some today if the price flattens for awhile and/or starts decreasing (and buy back after it drops). 
Anyone disagree?

**We're gonna fucking this thing so hard.**
I really want to know what will happen when China wakes up, sees the price, and reads the news.
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:13:21
Ah okay. I still love what you did though. Thanks for doing it @_date: 2015-05-04 15:44:36
Yes they are. Credit card companies charge people who use their service for the convinience. There is no such fee with a bank transfer.
@_date: 2015-08-22 18:13:11
They do. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 20:53:35
Would you say it's more accurate to say that you're waiting for an upward trend rather than the $200 price point? Your gut instinct is exactly what I'm talking about. Everyone is trying to predict the *future* of the market. Some are wrong, some are right. Either way, it seems more sensible to follow the trend (which you are describing) rather than waiting for a certain price.
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:50:04
If BTC were to rise $1/day for the next year, the mindset of "let me buy when it drops to $X" would never be met. The people who see that new companies are accepting BTC, respected economists are rallying behind BTC more universally, and see that the price has been going up for Y number of weeks *will* buy. They will also profit. Although that's a simple scenario, trends are a very real thing. The difficulty comes in identifying real upward trends as they're happening rather than after the fact. It's really about that simple with an investment as "hype-based" as BTC.

I am bring very serious and not trying to attack you.
Why do people have this mindset with stocks and bitcoin? I realize the two are different, but I do not understand the mindset with either. "I want to buy Apple stock since it's so profitable, but it's at an all time high. Let me wait until a down swing. Then, I will buy." "I want to buy BTC, but the price is falling. I think it will flatten and turn around at $200, so let me buy it then."
There is NO valid reason to think it will go down to $200 and then reverse. Instead, why not buy as soon as you see a month or two of steady increases? Better yet, wait until it is more accepted and seems like it really will take off. 
Back to Apple, it recently had its best quarter ever. They made more money that quarter than anyone ever. Now is an *amazing* time to buy Apple! Why wait until a recession and buy it on the way down?
Again, I'm asking sincerely. IMO, you should buy based on your informed opinion on the future of an investment. Selling at a pre-decided price point is definitely great to cut losses or realize gains. Buying with the same logic makes no sense to me.

$15 to my PayPal, and you get one (1) billion. 
$100 for ten (10) billion. 
WimgDoodles are on the rise! 
In all seriousness, good for you OP. I wanted to make another post, but I may as well say it here.
I hate to bleed the two different breeds that are and IMO, which deters from this thread, your bitcoin investment is a risky investment. Risk is great, FANTASTIC! if you know what you're doing. 
I hope your title is implying that you have $5000 that can become $4000 tomorrow. On the
 other hand, you and I (with similar investments) are looking to a future where we don't pay money to use money among the other BitCoin benefits. 
We look to the future where our money can grow from 5k to 7k in a few months. 22% is never a bad investment.
If this did not add conversational value, please provide an answer with your diligent downvote.

This is one of the most solid responses to this I've heard here. Thanks for sharing. I hope you get the truly deserved upvotes you deserve, despite the hivemind that I myself am a part of.

Coinbase responded directly to your thread. Check it out.

I'm sure I'll be downvotedin this sub, but
Why not? He gave more explanation than you did. I am neither agreeing nor disagreeing. I would just like to know what your reasoning is if you did take the time to comment.

Thank you for that response CoinBase!

I'm searching for why the prices just jumped after such a stable period. Might this explain it?

I don't mean to attack you. You are simply stating your hopeful opinion to OP? I'm just curious.
