You are not worth talking to.

What I said above is also entirely accurate.

Middlemen fees? You need to study the basics of bitcoin thoroughly. 
Bitcoin is a p2p network, everyone can host their own instance, and *make transactions entirely on your own*. There is no *middlemen* fees or whatsoever (except for that of negligible fee charged by miners, I say this feature is useless and it maybe changed in the future.).
As for exchanges.., as far as people trade things that are *different*, there are interests on maximizing profit. A little simplification on the percentage thing they setup, you can see that the so-called middlemen fee is just a phony way to obscure the value on the actual exchange of bitcoin and other currencies.
The middlemen fee is also not their primary interest, like banks, what makes them rich as fuck is in fact the whole volume they have in hands, which is bitcoin, analogues to gold on regular banks.

I am not saying a non-profit thing *must* work, but yours is a very bullshit reason.

Don't know why it gets downvotes.

well, everyone wants to own their wallet.


To certain degree, you may not mine but you are able to send coins, make addresses, accounts, encryption, whatever you want.
By running it you also *distribute* the userbase and hosts to the public (or us), that's why bitcoin shines at its core.

So be it. For the technical though, bitcoin is the first test subject and we are basically hyping it up in its most fragile form.


I am not saying the unix world has no virus, but people will have to make their choices as a matter of time and fact, that non-free software(microsoft windows, OSX) is hardly anything more than malware at its core.

why writes these up as if *they* care the slightest about bitcoin, just let the weak soul and stupid get away as they should.

I can't wait to see people actually believe innovation=disruption.
