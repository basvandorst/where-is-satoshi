I hate to say it but, this is a place where some regulation would be great. We are over here just demanding audits and Bitfinex is like haha, nah, trust us. We as individuals can boycott, but if there are that many people who aren’t, we are all going to suffer the consequences when the carpet is pulled out from underneath Tether.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:35:47
No, but that’s the problem. When the rug gets pulled out, the entire market crashes and burns, not just the people who use Bitfinex.

I’d have to agree with you, create your own FUD and hype for cheap in the future to manipulate the market. It’s the Wild West out here still with both social media and crypto.

Holy duplicate comment botman!

Can someone download the app and test it and tell us ffs. I’ve seen both arguments now, it should take 5 minutes to test but I️ don’t have the experience.

I'm buying $1k right now! BUY THE DIP

Same way credit default swaps ruined the price of housing. If Tether are found to be a house of cards, not only will demand be instantly reduced, but faith in the entire crypto ecosystem will take a hit over night.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:04:34
Guys this spam is a problem
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:04:49
Dogecoin started as a joke, and still is a joke, it’s not altcoin it’s a satire coin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:01:29
What the hell is with this spam bot army? This comment thread is insane!
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:59:26
This is perfect opportunity to test whether Tether creating artificial demand and high prices was FUD or real.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:54:40
1 doge = 1 doge, much wow
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:42:31
Haha so, by this analysis, the higher the fees, the lower the “PE ratio”, the less of a bubble. This makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:52:08
That’s what we call timing the market. Congrats.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:55:18
It will launch a siege on the wall until it is scaled. It will only retreat in small amounts to regroup its forces and get reinforcements.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:06:59
Unfortunately another spam bot who actually nailed the post and got lucky
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:05:47
This spam actually looks like it’s not, it just got lucky though, it is still actually spam
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:41:14
It also makes it exhausting and creates sleep deprivation.

Been discussing finances with my woman for 9 years without issue. This is how a recent conversation went, me-“should I️ buy $2k more bitcoin?” Her-“I️ don’t know. I’m more risk averse than you are, do what you want”
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:38:46
This is the worst post in Bitcoin history.

Yeah this is a great bet for us if OP pays out in bitcoin. 2 to 1 payout intrsinically in our favor.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:03:47
Uhh what? Seek better girlfriends/wives.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:56:26
No love for the 2.1 btc club? That’s realistic for upper middle class people.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:44:21
It’s a bot that recycles or emulates old comments and there has been a torrent of them today.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:42:41
I bought $1k.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:11:26
I️ give up. I️ can’t comment spam fast enough to these bots.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:13:35
Major incentive to FUD. Check out the Doc “Betting on Zero”. Rich people who short will make FUD their life’s mission.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:45:08
Oh my god why are there differing opinions on a fact?!?!
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:11:33
You have to buy an entire bitcoin at a time so unless you have $8750 you can’t buy. (Shhh guys)
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:53:22
I still see them EVERYWHERE, like 90% of comments in some threads.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:01:48
Also spam
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:18:58
Yeah, I️ was going to say the same thing. Very misleading graphic. Bad use of data.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:14:40
Heard that too. John, you’re going to need $45k to buy in.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:07:52
Is this some AI spam bot army just simulating bitcoin posts?
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:43:30
I️ keep seeing posts about a drop but it’s been bouncing around the same $300 for days. Maybe people are still thinking a $300 drop means something like it did when it was at $2k.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:03:45
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:44:46
What are they basing “earnings” off of? It’s a currency...
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:12:54
Thanks, sounds like much ado about nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:10:31
Your spam creator will love that your spamming 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:08:45
We need to do something about this, I can’t reply spam fast enough. I’m drowning in bots on this thread.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:27:21


I can guarantee you that this date is wrong or I’ll eat my left testi.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:21:58
How can you say it rising $600 in 4 days is the opinion of a crack smoker when it just rose $1400 in 36 hours?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:16:34
Ya, definitely, this is just so weird how big the flood of them is!
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:52:58
Big if true.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:48:14
Yup, not one person in 8 million gets it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:48:26
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:03:21
I️ found the one non spambot comment in the entire thread!
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:20:03
Okay but this ruling will make that original monopoly bigger and more entrenched sooo... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:55
Common sense says it shouldn’t be worth $1. Not doubting correction in the future but is it at $33k or $10k that we’re due?
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:53:57
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:29:54
Said like it’s a fact, but not true at all.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:05:20
Just found out through duplicate comment this is actually also spam
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:21:37
Never assume that something that has been rising will continue too unless you have another reason for believing it will continue to rise.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:47:00
I️ don’t understand how people don’t understand this. It’s a volatile and speculative market. It could be worth $0 or $999999999999.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:59:11


Huh? It has value because it represents value?


@_date: 2017-11-27 02:51:32
Ah, ty
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:57:06
Hey guy! So to;dr I️ tots found $.5million worth of bitcoin! So ya, totally didn’t make this up, just found it. No fomo here.
