cool will keep my eye on it. Usually first wave of dip buyers get their face ripped off and the second wave catch the lows. I view this as 80bn of market cap for sale from dumb money buying a parabolic breakout and it needs to get worked through over the next few weeks at least. Thanks.

new poster...I have been following this BTC run from the sidelines...I have been a hedge fund analyst trading stocks and options (more volatile than the craziest day in bitcoin) for 9 years (started in Jan 08 before the crash) so only thinking about it from that framework..I am curious why folks do not talk about bitcoin in terms of market cap. I am also curious how many folks have participated in parabolic trades. It seems pretty obvious to me that a 14k move that has trumped years of marketcap growth in less than 2 mos needs to be consolidated. I would think 8K seems like a screaming buy but also totally reasonable expectation over the next few months but plan to leg in at hopefully 13k and more heavily at 11k but the goal would be to load up at 8k. Almost all stock breakouts occur after periods of sustained consolidation so 20k 17k 14k and the daily freakouts all feels like noise until you go through this consolidation phase and you do not see sustained rallies during periods of high volatility so that also needs to dissipate which takes time. The flip side is i saw parabolic charts that look exactly like this in crude/agriculture in 08, DDD (3d printing company in 2012), GPRO 90 dollar stock went parabolic now trades at 9...my point is my strategy is to try and average cost around 10k put my stop at 5k eat a 50% loss if wrong and if it breaks below that know that its a bubble and the retail buyer we all need to get to 50k 100k will be burned and never coming back. Seems like not a lot of financial perspective being applied on this thread so curious if I am just not thinking about this the right way with this buyer base. I respect the HODL philosophy but i am not sure how many people are understanding the overall market cap dollar gains that have occured over the % moves.

Thanks I am not planning on daytrading just thinking about a reasonable entry point given how clearly late I am. I also am trying to use volatility in my favor because when something trades 20k and 13k in one week it inherently means chasing is stupid and the return profile of a 13k buy over a 20k buy is over 50% higher on a lifetime investment. As far as the 50% stoploss I am investing an amount id consider for speculation as I would any big stock position so meaningful enough if it pops off. That degree of loss is me saying let me really be wrong and not care if i eat it on a generational trade. I see options returns and losses that would equate to a 5x move in bitcoin (going to 100k) from here everyday so I am more or less desensitized to the percentage swings just want a set it and forget it price.
