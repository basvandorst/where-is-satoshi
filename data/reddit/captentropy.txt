If you can't get your money out, or even make online payments, how you going to buy bitcoin? Sounds like BS, but maybe people will look to bitcoin to be prepared for the next one... Italy I am looking at you.

Pretty cool idea, really helps to solidify the concept!
send $1

The block should send the reward to the person generating the block as i did (actually i accidentally used a different user name of mine, so ignore that, it should have said "CaptEntropy") .
There is some ambiguity of spaces vs newlines, I used newlines, handsomechandler said he is accepting either.

Pretty cool idea though, thanks for doing it!

I think it is awesome that you are working with ChangeTip, I just discovered them myself recently and enjoy tipping ;-&gt;

Damn whitespace , are people using new lines or just spaces?

Thanks for the response and for the you and the team's work on making the experience better!  I tested using a send from breadwallet today and got an almost instaconfirmation so the network is behaving better for the moment (and maybe you did something with the fees?).

They had TOR in the first episode, so I would not be surprised to find a BTC reference sometime soon :)

"Breadwallet lets you spend unconfirmed inputs immediately".  I don't understand how this helps.  If i send bitcoin to someone via my breadwallet to buy something, the seller (generally) is not going to release goods until there is a confirmation or 6.  Unless it is for a cup of coffee i suppose ;)
BTW: Breadwallet is an awesome wallet, and at the time I was "shopping" for a good open source ios wallet, the only solution that supported SPV and HD wallets. Maybe it still is.  But, the philosophy of making it "user friendly" backfires when it becomes "user is stuck" as in the current case. That is the nature of things.

Indeed this is quite annoying, I placed a transaction yesterday, with fee (Showing as "high priority" on blockchain.info) and still not included in a single block 12 hours later.  I see others having similar problems here in various reddit threads.  This is worrisome for the future of bitcoin. Is network under some kind of attack?

Even just setting it to the bitcoin core default would be a major improvement (.0001 BTC/ kb) . I often wonder where .000019 came from?
PS did bread ever implement BIP044 so that the bip32 seeds could be used with another wallet? For example if someone wanted to spend some breadwallet bitcoin faster in the current conditions.  (Current chatter is that some are increasing minrelay fee)

Very cool have a cookie @_date: 2015-10-28 17:56:59
Exactly, i mean really what kind of expert was that? 
send a cookie!

Probably better on a log scale, in which case [it is a straight line of course.](
 But  yeah, 80 minutes or longer will happen about 3.4 out of 10000 confirmations, so not so common but should happen once every couple of weeks as someone else said.  I haven't been "block watching" that long so was a bit surprised ! Guess i should have had a bit of a think on it first.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:00:50
Yeah, i should of looked again before i hit send, but still  took a long time to find! 
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:07:23
Well, I didn't stick around (in respect for the gentleman's privacy), but I presume he used the URL on the machine to find someone to contact !
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:48:46
It has been over an hour since the last block was mined... so there might be some delays.  Seems long though for a block!
