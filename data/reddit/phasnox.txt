Any way to enforce every node to use it? Seems like it would make the price of fees drop considerably.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:01:33
Yehp you are probably mostly right. Unless you absolutely believe Bitcoin is the future. Then investing now and paying later would be the best financial habit.

Bitcoin cash supporters downvoting this?
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:41:04
Yeahp that's what they told Musk when he proposed Tesla
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:45:55
Before my local store starts accepting it. Before I can start receiving my salary without worrying about having to back to fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:24:41
If the analogy was that btc was going to overthrow the current system yes. But it was rather to point that something was called a delusion and then it prove every naysayer wrong. Same will happen with Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:54:56
Lol yes. But I think it was premined? And I've heard it has a governance fee. Not sure if true.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:56:25
Nope. Yet it was not a delusion after all.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:19:47
Also I'm not sure his claim he was going to replace the entire car industry. But ok lol
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:02:54
Bitcoin is already here. Lightning has restore hope and I'd argue it's only years away.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:32:30
I'd say the easiest way to start is buying with credit card. But beware! Every single one of them will charge you a high fee when buying with cc. 
If you are in the US or some other fancy country you may be able to buy in coinbase. If, like me you belong to the third world, this is what I've used in the past:
* Xapo(the lowest fee)
* Coinmama
* Cex.io
The second easiest would be using localbitcoins or paxful. But again high fees, and a little cumbersome.
The third(for me) would be to use an exchange that allows wire transfers. This is by far the cheapest way with almost no fees to pay, but you may find it a little hard to do the wire, at least from where I live.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:04:09
Yehp that is basically the plan

Major crash, as for some time you will not know what chain is Bitcoin. 
Expect High volatility for some time, before and after.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:12:15
If I had a lot in the line, I would get the hell out as soon as the split happens. Out from both chains. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:09:40
Since there is no replay protection, and both chains say they are Bitcoin, there will be some time where no one will really now which chain is going to win. 
Now think of what people with a lot of money on this are going to do. You have 10M dollars invested. For a while you don't really know which is going to be Bitcoin(the one that ends with the higher price, that is Bitcoin). So what do you do? You get the hell out from both. You get the hell out, as soon as you can, and up until the dust is settled.
That is strategy 
Strategy  is to HODL both chains, again until the dust is settled and you clearly know which one is which. In that moment you sell the resulting loser coin, to buy other more interesting alt.
There will be a crash. No matter what, many of the big players are just going to withdraw to FIAT and the price is going to sink.
Of course this is just speculation. And you may want to play this game of risk if you like. But if you really want and advice. HODL. No matter how bad this crash will be, a year from now, I firmly believe the price is going to be more than double of what it is now.
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:02:44
Yes this is true. And I'm in favor of AML control, but this is shooting and asking later. And they are able to do this, because that is how the Old Order remains in control. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:59:33
Yeahp, I'm also thinking Payoneer. I'm thinking that, once one of this crypto cards is in my hands, I'm gonna ask my employer to pay me in pure Bitcoin. Let's see how that goes.
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:03:39
Yeahp, that's what I'm hoping. But until then, my funds are frozen. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:09:20
Yeahp the sad thing is, this is exactly what happened in my country in 1999. A major economical crisis that led to the closing of 3 banks and thousands of families losing all their life savings. No one could withdraw even $5. 
In case you are curious for the details 
Yet another reason to end the Old Order.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:53:34
Yeah this has cross my mind. Although a bit cumbersome.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:11:19
I live in Ecuador. Although cryptocurrencies are kinda banned, many are using them regardless.
My hope is that TenX, TokenCard or something similar is finally available so I can load the card with Bitcoin or other alt, and pay with that.
I think we are months away now, but to my knowledge only TokenCard is going to ship worldwide.
PS: I tried convincing my landlord to accept Bitcoin but he would not take it :(
@_date: 2018-03-02 09:01:49
Yes utilities like electricity and water, but.. we pay for those, they are not free. And then again isn't the tax I pay for every purchase I made enough? It's 12%, pretty high if you ask me. On top of that, there are additional taxes you pay for almost everything. E.g. A Toyota Corolla can cost you 30k-35k due to import taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:13:53
I laughed more than I should've
@_date: 2018-03-02 08:29:16
Unfortunately Monaco is not shipping to SA. I wrote to them asking "Do you have plans to ship to SA?" I got a cold "No we dont" as an answer lol. My hope is TokenCard. I think they are the closest to launch worldwide. I hope they support Bitcoin. If not my next bet is on TenX.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:55:32
I do love my country :( wouldn't want to leave but rather fight for this policy to change. I wrote a piece about it:

Yehp just did. I'm a SELELR :'(
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:09:20
Well said
@_date: 2018-03-02 08:16:12
I'd say is very wrong that they tax you on your income. Specially if it is no generated here. And specially in a country like Ecuador where there is no decent public services, and where most politicians have enrich themselves with the taxpayers money. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:55:51
I am a law abiding citizen, and I get the AML stuff and all. But I think it unfair for your funds to be frozen before proving anything.
@_date: 2018-03-02 03:08:35
This is the ultimate goal. However up and until we get mainstream adoption is rather hard to pay the bills using just Bitcoin. To be honest, as soon as one of the cryptocards is on my hands I will immediately ask my employer to pay me in Bitcoin. 
This is just the beginning of the end.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:04:36
No. It's pure logic

Hello my friend!
I found this post helpful when I first started: 
Let me sum up a few options to avoid buying with a CC:
*  : Unpopular, but it should get you there. They way this works is, you buy tether(USDT), and then you transfer that to any exchange with tether wallet, and then you buy bitcoin.
* Localbitcoins or Paxful: Here you trade directly with other people
* Any other exchange that accepts wire transfers.
Consider tipping this poor soul:  1LZdidB5nWgXZAR6PzcP9F7m4rQ5q5yuAi
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:05:11
Yehp my friend. I'm buying/selling at a 5% margin right now. But is risky as helll. I'm confident the price is going to finish in ~6k by the end of this year. I just made 10% in and now HODLING.
Cheers! And welcome!
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:39:09
Yo Fiat or alts?
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:41:38
Lol sorry I called you a fanatic

I dunno why, but I read this with the voice of Jesse from Breaking Bad.
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:58:21
But again how practical the LN really is. Bear with me.
I spent around 0.02 btc a week in groceries, lets say I have a salary of 0.7btc/month.
# Scenario 
I lock 0.08btc/month and open a payment channel with my preferred grocery store.
# Why I'd be reluctant to do this
0. I not always spend the same amount each month. If I run short, I would have to open a new channel a second time, having to pay 4 times for fees(to open and close the channel 2 times). 
0. During the month if I would like to buy groceries in another store, I'd have to open a channel with that other store, locking even more of my btc.
# Scenario 
I open a payment channel with a hub that has access to my preferred store.
# Why I'd be reluctant to do this
0. This sounds better, as I would potentially have access to other stores as well with a single payment channel. But how much should I lock? All of it? Half of it? What if I run short?
0. You probably are going to come across a lot of other stores/restaurants etc that are no connected to this hub.
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:03:20
What OS?
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:29:28
In 2020 you'll pay the LAMBOs with Bitcoin. Everyone would already have dump their FIAT anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:32:38
Process is like this:
0. Deposit with paypal
0. Buy SSL
0. Buy Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:54:42
How come?
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:15:55
You do sacrifice some decentralization. But is not as bad as I initially thought.
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:03:06
Oh ok gotcha gotcha. So technically I could really have this channels open for a long time. Lets say I open a 0.04btc channel with my grocery store. After 2 weeks my channel will look like this from spending: 
**Me: 0.02btc Store: 0.02btc.**
And then lets say you owe me 0.01btc, you pay me through the LN, a route is found through You ...othersMaybe -&gt; GS -&gt; Me. Then my channel will look like: 
**Me: 0.03btc Store: 0.02btc.**.
Now I see it! Thanks!!
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:19:29
Lol "repent". "REPENT you sinners!"
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:31:42
We don't really know which one is going to "win"
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:02:18
So in an ideal world, my employer would open a channel with me for 0.7btc, and they would also have payment channels open with every store I would like to use. So the transactions happening would only be a give and take of those 0.7btc. 
Seems highly impractical though.

For the lightning network to be usable, every user must connect to a hub. A "central" hub or hubs where other users connect to. 
I don't hold bitcoin cash, but is users like you that make me wonder if I'm in the correct side. Fanatic at best.
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:26:06

@_date: 2017-10-31 20:52:00
I was in the same spot than you a few months ago. Unfortunately there is no other reliable way buying with Paypal.
Even if you pay with credit card the fees are horrible in sites like coinmama or cex.io
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:39:02
Problem is no one is selling. Lol "the problem"
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:33:30

Gotcha. But aren't the Core devs payed by Blockstream? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:30:03
I have use virwox in the past:  The thing is, you have a limit of $100/day for the first buy. Not sure how they handle that, but now my limit is $200/day. 
I guess they raise this cap as you buy more.
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:22:05
It's in alpha, but going through the features it has EVERYTHING I've been looking for. Only thing left is lightning. 
Right now I'm using Eclair, but the UI is ugly.
