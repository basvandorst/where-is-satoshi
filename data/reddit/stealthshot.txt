Nope lol still in plastic wrap lol
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:28:25
Bought it direct from the Ledger website 
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:48:36
Interest in BTC has dropped, 4k volume daily has killed the price. More interest = price increase IMO. Back a couple months ago, and even a couple weeks ago we were around 20-30k btc per day. No volume now
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:24:17
Yeah the sell wall is weak as hellllll, will rocket once volume picks back up 
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:57:27
Won’t ever pass 6k, anywhere around 7 or under is good price. I don’t think it will drop any lower than it did today though. Found good support and resistance around 6700. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:57:32
Volume been around 3-4k for the past few days and someone knew they could manipulate the price down easily based on the low volume. Over 4.4k btc sold in less than an hour at market. Will recover.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:53:55
BTC drops have been on huge volume blocks the past few days. Big time manipulation 
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:39:03
Based on TA from previous declines, BTC could touch somewhere around 4-5k if it breaks 6k support. Big blocks have been sold dropping this down to where its at, but the problem right now is that BTC sentiment and interest is at a low. Google trends shows bitcoin searches, buy bitcoin searches, etc have just plummtted. In 2013, BTC went to about 1200 and fell to around 100. A fall like that would mean BTC could seek the 4-5k price again. I doubt it, but the bottom is where people are at a point where they panic and just dont think it can go any lower. I wish 6300 was bottom but one big dump of 3-4k coins again and we will break 6000. GLTA.
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:55:20
Someone dumping big, price keeps trying to recover and then drops another 50 dollars on like a 100 coin market sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:58:32
Gotcha. Yeah I’ve been watching GDAX book like 24/7 for the last week. Been so many blocks coming in on the sell to drive price down to 7500, so many block buys then and again it was driven down today. Weak hands and newbies who bought at 15-20k don’t have that kind BTC. Also algos are there now too, lots of .001 buy and sells 
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:02:45
Drop was maniupulated af, buyers won now. Reversal back to 12k incoming. Rip all those weak hands who sold at 7300. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:36:45
Dow down 400 again, we should hold the 200 moving average of around 6600 i think
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:33:38
7265 lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:37:22
6k bottom, and 200ma. Should slowly rise back from here and on to new highs in the coming months
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:13:56
The past week when we went back to 10.8 or so and then down has been pure manipulation down imo. We went from 10.6 to well under 10k in a minute candle on GDAX from a huge market sell. All drops since have been 1000+ coin market sells that have tanked the price. It's not a bear market, it is people trying to drive the price down. Look at the sell wall going up? Thin as hell. Price spikes back up as buying pressure is there but then big market sell to a lower low. Been happening now for the past week. Once we break up again I think we should see $12k+. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:46:00
Lol like all the other people here. No clue about stocks let alone cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:06:41
Preview pic on the App Store shows a pic of entering the amount of money and it says “Cash &amp; BTC” on it
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:40:42
Been watching this dude for a while, and seem to agree with him. Looks like a lot of accumulation has been happening with the retraction to the 200ma. I except another run here soon. I bought at this level before the big run and am adding. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:55:16
Off to 8500. Should be over $10k within a week.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:55:16
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:56:31
Check out this address, 2000+ increase in BTC, for a total of  almost 6250 coins now. That 40.6 million at a price of 6500. Big players are playing on the bearish news lately, and the drops we have already had to drive it down and buy lower. Weak hands and people who bought at 19k dont have the BTC to do this or buy this much. Nobody that was dumb enough to buy at 19k can be buying 40 mil.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:33:23
lol back to 7200 after it was driven to 6500
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:49:44
Completely agree but everyone here is clueless and either bought at 19k and sold or hasnt bought and just wants to see it burn
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:39:14
Exactly. Comparing it to previous movements isn’t fair as all of those were when bitcoin wasn’t in the public eye at all. And still it’s not for a large part
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:52:24
Told all the haters and people who dont know what they are doing. 6000 was bottom, lets goooo
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:39:10
Reversal, followed by good sec news, and coinbase Segwit news should rally this. Plus whenever Robinhood starts their crypto program this should gain even more steam 1.2m people signed up for it so far.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:41:14
Not at 19k, now they are loading.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:05:33
Filling the gap from the astronomical climb from about 6k to 19k. Should rise back up yes
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:01:37
Dont forget too the fee reduction = miners selling their btc to take money while they can to get out. All the fud and reversion to 200ma plus miners getting out caused the drop. Recovery is now, and new highs!
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:42:41
SEC basically said we are for crypto and emerging technology but want people to be protected. Great news!
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:49:12
Explain? Like I assume that means more buying and holding is happening but where are you seeing that graph at
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:09:07
What announcement?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:55:28
Has been happening again, and now the reversal again
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:24:28
Break 7k and we gone
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:19:03
oh no for sure, just was saying this price isnt bc of anything about bitcoin itself - rather just being manipulated. Back to 9145 already, and the reversal should begin
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:01:03
6425 technically on GDAX but yes
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:01:28
200-300 coin sell wall at 8300 has moved down slowly the past few hours and is at 8030. Big players been trying to drive it down, which happens but we gonna break free and make it back to 10k tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:07:01
To the moon we return, fuck the haters
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:44:46
Because there is a lot of uninformed investors who have no idea how the stock market, let alone cryptocurrency market work. And they bought at 19k
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:04:11
still here, but we aint dropping. Fighting it. Buy wall up to about 30btc, sell slowly getting eaten away
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:26:48
you cant short btc....
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:41:09
Needs a 1.5-2k reversal. The ones previous have only been 1k and havent held
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:11:43
Told ya, 6k was bottom and now we are reversing. It wasn’t a crash, it was a gap fill back to 6k. We spiked wayyyy to quickly to 20k in too quick of time. Look at the climb from 1-6/7k. Took months and there was steady climbing that built support as there were tons of transactions and buyers at each level unlike from 10-19k. Now that we filled the gap we will climb back to previous levels and reach new highs. Meanwhile all the people who have no idea who stocks or crypto work got out and/or got burned for being unknowledgeable and we rise. See ya again at 20k+
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:35:53
Can’t tell if serious or not 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:08:16
200-300 coin sell wall at 8300 has moved down slowly the past few hours and is at 8030. Down to 120, and wait holy shit we broke it
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:44:40
Fuck all the haters. This has been beaten down by some huge seller for weeks. About time the bulls took over. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:22:59
Firmly believe we will see a big rise here soon back to $10k. This downtrend since the two peaks at 11k are from big owners dumping. Once whoever it is that keeps dumping coins is done we should move up. We keep getting pushed down on huge coin dumps and then move back up on low volume. If you have been looking closely at the minute/5min charts on GDAX for the past couple weeks you would see how these 2-5k coin sells have dropped us everytime there is a recovery.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:27:06
Ah right. Lol rekt. No clue on how this market works clearly
