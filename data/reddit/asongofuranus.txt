Good for you. I sent 11 USD worth of btc to my other wallet, paid 2 USD fee and have been waiting for 3 hours now. Not a single confirmation yet.
Edit: ok, so I'm downvoted for telling the truth. Only blind faith, memes and moon circlejerk then? This sub really is as bad as they say.

Internet, Uber, Twitter, Airbnb, Facebook, Google... All of those and many others started out as a way of positively influence people and change the world for the better. But in the end it's all about money and always have been. Those altruistic ideas are put in place only to attract people who believe it and who in turn make that thing popular and widespread.

You can also supposedly get an erection by using it. That's one thing it has common with BTC.

Except for every pump and dump it's a pump with a dump that somehow ends with +25% of value before the pump. So isn't it more like... a pump with a retracement and consolidation?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:45:54
No. So it's exactly like BTC.

*meme guy looking at butterfly* Is this accumulation? 
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:23:43
Yeah. But tbh, CT was saying exactly the same thing.

The Year is 3851. One BTC costs 4 solar systems. SEC still not sure whether to approve ETF or not.

Thanks. I finally kinda understood leverage.

But you know there's a limited amount of them, right?

[BitcoinMarkets]( has been truly a beacon of light in these trying times.

what the fuck is "MM" ?

The people who said those things will never buy no matter how low the price goes. I personally know like 3 people like that. They'll all want to wait for the lower price and will miss out.

Ah, ok. Compared to NYC it's probably fine. Still overpriced af for the locals, but you will probably see it as hilariously cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:06:10
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:03:22
Sprinkle a couple of ''I can't afford a whole Bitcoin anymore'' in there.

You somehow made a very cringey scene infinitely more cringier. That's actually quite an achievement.
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:24:31
Step one: Reconsider.
There are no other steps.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:15
yes, don't let anyone judge you that you masturbate over that.

I set-up Mycellium wallet just for this purpose. Sent btc there and bought a couple of games over the past year. And the ballance in USD is still getting bigger. It truly is magic internet money.
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:49:10
It looks like it's not the only thing that's *Down.*
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:19:33
That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!

I didn't know that coinbase is available in my country. They must have expanded recently. I've been using Bitstamp for the last couple of years.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:41:04
GOOD point.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:28:31
...what's the point then?
