Ripple is here to stay and if you don't make lots of Bitcoins because of it then R.I.P. yourself

So does Robocoin offer support for other exchanges?
Or did you have to code it into your atm yourself?

Not every truth nor criticism is irrelevant.  Trolls are easy to find, as are die hard fans, people who don't care, critics, criminals, etc.
I for one think has thrown common sense out the window on multiple occasions and the mods here ban with iron fists and are probably shitty people IRL for the most part.
Anyway, just my 2 Myriad.  +2 MYR
edit:  oh it was an admin admin ban.  still though, iron fists and what not

if the goal is to test something well then yes you are disrupting the ecosystem.  test the capability of the system on the testnet plz, not live net where peoples bitcoins matter.  this IS an attack your service is behind.  own up to it ya jabronis

I understand that the internet allows DoS attacks by its very nature and I DO think that someone isnt playing nice.  It just so happens the law and courts are always about playing games to help out whomever is kicking down the most benefit$.  I like to understand all points of view while trying to discern what is factual and what matters in the end.  I hope someone can bring Coinwallet to justice, but how?  Is this going to be a legendary Bitcoin v. Coinwallet case?

The volunteer and open source nature of Bitcoin may make it difficult for any case to hold water if compensation for damages are sought.  plus the whole oh its a currency oh its not a currency thing never helps.  I agree there is malicious intent in these improperly done tests and the fact these arent done on the testnet can help people seek compensation (but in what form?!?!!)
What can anyone really do in your opinion to limit crashing during a stress test?

By that logic one of two things are possible.  Bitcoin in it of itself is criminal because the protocol allows spamming of udp data.  OR.  None of this matters because the protocol allows the spamming of udp data in order to transact bitcoin to one another; it was always assumed a backlog would be generated with enough use of the software and a small blocksize.  Isn't that what everyone wanted anyways so that fees would pump?  Does this mean no matter the block size in the future if use outwieghs capability will there always be an abuse or disruption of nodes due to the baked in functionality of bitcoin?

Don't get nailed on your taxes.
The USA would see that as a gain.
(regardless of what laws do or don't exist right now)

I say altcoin/bitcoin trading is more wild westy.  Although Bitcoin DID start the whole thing.  Bitcoin is Clint Eastwood.
