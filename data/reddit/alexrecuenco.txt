"CEO of lightning?"
I am confused... do you mean some company that is helping develop lightning?
Lightning is an open source project after all, with many implementations thus far... I don't think there is a CEO, unless you are referring to a specific company working on it

The miner that produces it takes it himself. 
No, it doesn't show on the mempool, but if I fill 30% of my blocks with spam... the mempool itself fills up 30% faster whenever my blocks are added to the chain

Pretty sure this one was a developer talk.
 But I havent had time to check it myself. So until the  I will take your word for it ;)
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:32:09
I wouldnt follow the bank analogy too far... Notice that a bank has full control of your money and allows you to use it.
On the other hand, a lightning "account" doesnt give away the control of the money. **you have full control of the money at all times**
You and the other party both need to "sign" a transaction every time you and the other party want to change the balance.
Nevertheless, if neither you nor the other party are able to agree on a final balance, the money is not locked up. You can still broadcast the final balance to the network and recover your funds.
That is *the security risk* of lightning:
 Either party could broadcast a previous balance that was more favorable to them, instead of the final one.
To prevent that risk... if either party broadcast unilaterally an older balance, the other party may take the WHOLE balance if they can "proof" there was a more recent version.
Therefore, you need to monitor the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:03:16
I just want to remind those that are not aware of this fact:
If you are a miner spamming the network to increase the fees, **you are not paying the fees**. You don't broadcast the transaction, you just mine it yourself to get your own fees. 
It just **looks** like there are ton of high fee transactions in automatic software that chooses fees.

Can somebody point me to the resources describing how to "Refund" a channel without trust through another node?
I can't seem to find any resources on that.

I saw about a month ago Vitally talking about sharding, and how it would be a quadratic scaling solution at least... Although it didnt seem as far developed as lightning is now... I cant find the source though
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:23:09
Well, they did prove miners were spamming the network...
The whole point is that software doesn't look at the mempool, they look at the median transaction fee in the last blocks and decides from that what will be the fee required to input a new transaction.
therefore, people using this type of software that doesn't let them choose the fee, only lets them see the fee proportionally to the network fee, send transactions with higher fees. This in turn props up more people sending transactions at those higher fees, etc. Clogging up the network with high transaction fees, And the miner makes profit!

One important thing to note is that, as long as you don't use your wallet in your computer, assuming your wallet files are encrypted with a unique password, they can't un-encrypt that data.... as far as I know...
So, safest thing if you have a wallet on your computer is to not use it until this is resolved and you have patched your software. Do not write the password on your computer that decrypts your wallet
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:19:37
You can indeed open a channel where one side starts with 0 and the other side stars with some amount of money.
The economical incentive to agree to open that type of channel is a different matter entirely

This is why trading got halted anyway:
Someone was trying to manipulate the market and pump the price artificially due to lack of liquidity. They noticed and stopped the trading until their order book had enough liquidity to resume

Just for clarification:
The cryptocurrencies "market cap" is really M1. It only talks of the monetary supply (And it inflates it, since a relevant % of those coins are already lost forever)
So yeah, that graph above is indeed M1, but so is the cryptocurrencies graphs, we don't have economical models yet to describe cryptocurrencies any better than just multiplying the total money of coins with the price right now.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:58:34
I mean, the point isn't to speculate and raise the price and pump money into it indefinitely with no outcome, that is what I meant.
It is meant to be used as a peer-to-peer transfer of value. You can do so through contracts, fancy micro-payments, or whatever you fancy, but you are just moving something from a peer to another peer without requiring trust. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 01:54:37
That is completely fixed with the new bc1 format that is being adopted slowly in all coins. It allows even 5 mistakes, and it would still catch it (someone correct me if i am wrong)
Nonetheless, in bitcoin adresses nowadays, there is still a check sum with the last 5 characters of your address (not entirely sure if five). So although it is not proven mathematically, like it is with the bc1 addresses, it is still fairly unlikely you will make a mistake.
Keep checking anyway, there are malicious crafted software that could try to trick you, by trying to make an address that look close enough to yours/the persin you pay

Lets assume for a second that tether is legitimate. 
The way its price stays at $1 should be due to people that have set up already connections with tether, and whenever they see the price go below 1, they buy and make a profit. So if you remove their way to interact with their bank accounts, and burning their usdt, you would expect the price to become unbounded from below, like it is happening...
Of course... it is weird since the total suply of tether doesnt seem to go down, so probably that is not the case... but someone that "believes" on tether could argue that way

Yes, to make a segwit transaction you must have a segwit wallet. I think the newer version of Ethereum uses segwit already. 
You don't need to rush into this tho. If your money is safely stored and you don't need to move it. 
Keep in mind that most services have not yet switched to segwit yet, so we can't use the full potential until the services that you use start using segwit as well. (Which might take a while)

Can we place a list on the bitcoin reddit of the known public keys that the developers of known wallets are using to sign their programs?
I think that would make it easier for users to be more careful, just by having two different places that provide the same keys... (or 3, or 4)

the point is, it can be defined in terms that are known to people on economics already.
In physics, we don't say "Region where the topology of light paths doesn't contain any loops" or something similar. We say "black holes" because the concept is much easier to grasp. Everybody already knows what "black" and "hole" is, even if it is not quite correct.
Therefore the definition:


It is easier to grasp the concept that way. And non-experts need to be able to understand and use this protocols as well, it is beneficial to explain concepts for a wider audience sometimes

Ok, maybe I am explaining myself incorrectly:
Notice that you are in a Mexican Standoff. But he may not be aware you are if you don't tell him. He is definitely aware you are if you tell him.
 You have no way of broadcasting any transaction, he can just wait until you negotiate with him how much you are gonna pay for ransom, or until he gets tired of waiting and closes unilaterally.
Keep in mind that once you lost your history, if you request someone to close with you only one of 4 things can happen
1. He tells you what the "stage" is, and you both create a closing transaction signed by both from there (zero risk for him, risky for you, it doesn't have a justice clause)
2. He tells you what "stage" it is, and you keep transacting between each other (zero risk for him, risky for you, you just started signing from a stage that you are not sure if it was the last stage, but now it is too late, you already agreed that previous transaction was correct)
3. He tells you to broadcast the latest transaction yourself unilaterally (Or he hands you one that he would consider the latest one, zero risk for him, risky for you)
4. He waits until he needs to close the channel and closes it himself unilaterally. (Zero risk for him, and zero gain for him)
As you can see, only on (4) you can't lose anything. However, if you tell him that you don't know the latest stage, he can just lock your money forever, since you are afraid of broadcasting anything. If I was him, I would just set an email alert for one year later and try to contact you again then.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:47:19
Well, if you don't have a channel open already, you still need to make a bitcoin transaction to pay them. Instead of wasting that transaction paying them, why not open a channel instead? The transaction size is not much bigger, it is just a 2 on 2 multisig afterall.
The other node in this model requires the receiving side to place **no funds** whatsoever.
Notice how this doesn't violate the security assumptions on lightning, since under this model only the first state would have a zero balance. All subsequent updates of the state after the funding of the channel should leave a non-zero balance
1.  If I am making a payment to you and you make me pay you a fee, that is part of our payment. And is accounted for in the price of the item.
2. The other side, the receiving side, is at no risk whatsoever. They are placing **no funds** in that channel. Therefore, you can make the software open those types of channels automatically, which simplifies the security assumptions and simplifies the implementation as well.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:05:34
As long as that backup is done automatically, and it is created before or while the channel is updated on the correct order. That seems like a perfect solution to prevent losing the state.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:13:43
on average, those two numbers will be as long as the actual data you are storing, or longer. So not so much a "compressed" data format. But fun nonetheless
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:31:49


is, in pi 


@_date: 2018-03-26 19:31:37
Short answer:


If you want to keep a backup, you are on the wrong. LN is not a cold wallet, it is as hot as it gets, you need to be connected...
You should only keep the latest state, and update it live. 
If you do the updating in the correct order, (increasing indexes before adding a new state, etc) if you lose the latest state, you are aware that you have lost the latest state, and you won't broadcast something in the incorrect order.
For an analogy, a hardware system with a PIN that checks the pin and then updates the number of checked pins can be broken into by unpowering at the right time. A hardware system that updates the number of checked pins correctly, and updates the state correctly BEFORE checking can't be exploited like that.
If anything, you can keep a server that keeps the justice transactions IDs. And then on your "lightweight" device, you keep only the latest point.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:56:44
Nope, this is what you are telling the other peer if you respond:
"Hey, I am over here, I forgot where the hell where we? Can you tell me in which state where we are at?"
At that point, he knows he can broadcast an old state with minimal probability of you being able to broadcast a justice transaction, and he can just broadcast the state of the channel that benefits him the most.
Of course, if you already trust each other to not attack each other... that is irrelevant.
 How to fix this?
In the future, someone could set up a server where they can monitor the network as a backup (this "fix" requires trust on that server... but you can modify this to require less trust)
- You can tell the server "Hey, look for this transaction ID, and if you see this transaction on the network, you will know what to do with this specific signature"
- If that server is open about which transaction IDs he is monitoring, even if you lost your local state, you wouldn't broadcast an old state, since you would compare your transaction ID with the server.
- On top of that, you can feel safer telling your counterparty in the channel that you are lost, and if he could tell you where you guys are at. If he lies to you, you could check up with the service you are using, whether the justice transaction ID is already on the server or not. Which would mean you are actually on an older state.

The whole discreet log contracts... For those that didn't get that far into the talk... It is **Huge**.
You can basically pay in **any** coin through bitcoin, and settle the price at some pre established date, after the payment was done. 
Of course, there must be some exchange that want to provide the public message signed by them.

Nice reports.


I would like to point out that the recommendation by Dryja (and to be honest, the only think that might make sense for growth) is that you open a payment channel with the point that you want to trade with **directly** when you need to make a payment to them.
In the ideal situation, the software would just open a channel with the amount of money you need to pay them, if it doesn't find a route and push it all that money to them in a first payment.
Then, when you need to get paid, the person that wants to pay you should first find if there is a route to you, if not, open a channel with you directly and push his funds.
This makes sense because:
- You need to make a transaction through bitcoin anyway to pay them. There is no extra cost of simply opening a lightning channel and paying that way.
- Easier to implement, since it is a push only method. Most of it can be automated.
- You already require a minimum trust if you are making a payment, so it is better to open a channel with them than with someone at random.
- It organically grows the lightning network with demand, not artificially with people locking funds without knowing in advance how much they will need.

Hearing the actual senate hearing on bitcoin... 
They are already lobbying hard to make the senators try to control regulators...
The exact words of one of the senators "This technology goes against the national interest of the US" or something similar. Referring to the ability of other countries to evade US sanctions.
If we don't lobby as well, they win. We have enough millionaires around here to pull that off.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:43:07
This is why all LN developers ask users to not keep backups, unless those backups update in real time...
According to Dryja, if this happens to you. the best thing is to go quiet, and to wait for the other user to hopefully close the channel when they see you are not responding
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:29:38
Yes. They would for the first couple years. 
For those first couple years, they are pay-to-public-key scripts, not pay-to-public-key-hash scripts :)
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:45:03
I had never seen it that way!
I would like to add that this would only happens once cracking a 256 bit password with a quantum computer is cheaper than the value of 50 BTC.
Therefore, we can assume that as long as none of those coins move, creating a QC right now is far more expensive than that (and running it)
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:27:55
Not necessarily. 
QC makes it feasible, It doesn't make it instantaneous.
Running the simulation for each password might still take hours or days. And this might not be economically feasible if the cost of those couple days running a QC is more than the value you would obtain.
You only need a chip with ~ 256 qubits by the way. You would NEVER get a million qubit computer ever running lol. Your normal classical computer is a 64 bit computer, not a billion bit computer.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:06:37
It doesn't work both ways, the risk for the other party is ZERO. Sorry for the simplified explanation
When you close a channel together, you don't broadcast the lightning script, you just sign a 2 multisig to each of your wallets... Otherwise it is a mexican standoff. 
And if it is a mexican standoff, you might as well just wait for him to close, without giving him extra information about what you lost.
 For a longer explanation:
He can tell you 
- "Oh I am sorry, which one was the last state you had?"
- "Oh, ok, we were actually in this other state. Now, let's keep working from this point". 
You don't want to sign anything from any poin... he could be cheating if you lost your channel.
And now it just comes to who needs to unlock the money from the channel first. He can now stall this forever, at no risk. 
If on the other hand you hadn't told him anything... you are in the same situation, hoping for him to provide the latest channel, but in this case he might think that you just went offline and close it.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:52:30
The point made above was that as soon as quantum computers exist, those coins would be moved
I was trying to argue that that is not the case. They could want to keep it as secret as long as possible. 
However, as soon as it becomes economically viable to break those early coins, they will be pressured to do so.
I like as well how that is an economic incentive. We should tell google that 1000000 BTC are waiting for them if they build a quantum computer
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:53:06
Lovely explanation. 
However, I think they didn't explicitly say something important on the explanation:
- After they share secrets of the previous state, what prevents either party from simply using that secret to spend all the funds? By broadcasting an old state. Since you already know the secret.
- The key detail is that if you are Bob, you don't sign Alice commitment transaction unless you want to publish it to the network. 
- Alice has sent you the commitment transaction that includes **YOUR** secret. If you sign it after you have given Alice your secret, she can use your secret to spend your part of the transaction.

The default way of paying should be:
1. I scan his qrcode.
1. Am I routed with him? 
    - If so, make a payment through lightning
    - If not, make a lightning connection and push funds.
Think about an exchange setting up lightning. Iif all they had to do was place a bech32 address on their website for paying bitcoin. They would end up with a huge lightning node connectivity passively, without having to lock their own funds. And that would benefit the lightning ecosystem. Otherwise, they will never have an incentive to create lightning payments. 
And following your analogy:
Your analogy doesn't work. We are not setting up the internet! We are making payments. I don't lock funds in a network if I don't know if I am going to use it. And certainly, if all channels were funded 50-50... you can't bootstrap the network.
If certain people want to set up channels with higher bandwidth between them, good on them! But that shouldn't be the default setting.
 What matters is how do we make the integration of lightning grow organically with other bitcoin payment methods.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:10:53
?? 
With BIP 32, 39, 44 you haven't needed to backup private keys for a looooong time.
You need to write down a seed that generates them (But still requires a passphrase to generate them anyway, a derivation path, and compromising a private key doesn't compromise the rest of your money)
Hardware wallet have better privacy properties and better security properties than having just private keys. (And you rely far less on the software having a good random number generator)

Yes. Ledger IS cold storage. Don't listen to the people recomending paper wallets. Using them correctly as cold storage is basically doing what ledger does but manually and the chance of making a mistake.
You can do multisignature between the ledger you carry and another ledger stored in a safe place if you want to be extra safe.
As far as I know, in America they aren't entitled to ask for your password without a warrant. It is in the UK where you should be worried about it.
If you require your bank account to pay rent, etc. **Don't use that same bank account for bitcoin stuff**. You are risking having your money stuck
Ypu can just open two bank accounts in different banks. First one in the bank your university recommends. Second one in another bank where you are going to do thode transactions related with bitcoin
 Who might report you?
Unfortunately, it is not that there are some more friendly banks. Is that all banks have to report to the us government of activity, and they are told what looks suspicious already. If you have done with coinbase your KYC correctly, and once you transfer your bitcoin out of the exchange you dont move it to tainted adresses (bitcoin adresses related with gambling and such). Then, you will have less problems for sure

You can open it under a passphrase that has next to nothing money anyway. ;)
But I agree that he might want to have another wallet for immediatte funds.
In any case, i am using hot to indicate that it is touching a computer that is connected to the internet, that if infected, it could leak your private keys.  We might be using slightly dofferent definitions of hot
Sorry if you thought it sounded hostile with the phrasing. I just keep hearing people to use a paper wallet for good security. When in fact, many people that use paper wallets are basically using a very tedious hot wallet,  and they do not realize that

I am sorry, you are misunderstanding what "longest" means.
If you actually read the code, "longest" specifically means, "longest in terms of which chain has more added difficulty over time"
That is, each block has a difficulty, add them all. The longest chain is the chain that had this "total difficulty" number be bigger. 
Therefore, even if we ignore the fact that one of the chains broke the consensus of how difficulty should be adjusted, **bitcoin is still LONGER than bcash** (or bitcoin cash, however you want to call it). 
 Now, Why do we do define "Longer" in that way?
Note how under your criteria, you could attack any cryptocurrency by creating a blockchain from the starting point with fake time stampts that started a 1000 years ago, and moved from one block to the next by 1 hour. By doing so, you could create a very long chain of blocks, since difficulty on blocks would be very small. 
This attack is not possible because the total difficulty would be smaller than the total difficulty of the bitcoin chain, even if it is a 10000 block longer.
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:56:17
 The explanation:
I don't make that leap. Haha. You are misunderstanding what proof of work really means. Proof of Work literally means "Most **WORK**" not "*longest chain*". 
Longest chain is a simplification, since, **as long as everyone uses the same difficulty algorithm, *they are equivalent***. However... Someone (Bitcoin Cash) changed that, so we have to actually use the proper definition.
 Let's find how it is done in the code
That is literally how it is written in the bitcoin code, and in any competent blockchain:
I was trying to simplify, but since you don't seem to like that. The term in the code is called [chainwork]( or "total work" (But it is really just adding the combined difficulty
Then, here you have the code where it chooses between which chain it should use, in [validation.cpp]( the relevant line for us is:












So, that line above explains which chain is actually chosen as valid. The one with the most **nChainWork**, not the "**nHeight**".
Now, let's take a look at how the nChainWork is calculated, in that same file,  [validation.cpp](






I removed the convoluted parts to make it clear. Basically, `nChainWork`, is the `nChainWork` of the previous block plust the `GetBlockProof` of the last block.
And if you look at the `GetBlockProof`, which you can find in [chain.cpp]( you will see how you were mistaken and how it is calculated. Which yes, is the work needed to pass that chain.


















 In summary.
Please, check your sources ��. 
And if you are not coding your Proof of Work to mean "most work" be certain that at some point someone will find a way to attack your network
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:37:19
I guess your code-語 fluency is what makes you agree with me on that. Thank you.
- So in your first part you agree that indeed proof of work means more work, agreeing that indeed, I was right on that. And that when you said Longest chain you were incorrect.
- Then on your second part, you first attack me personally, and then say my explanation is misguided because Proof of Work doesn't mean "longest chain"? 
   I was explaining in that second part WHY "more work" is the metric, and why longest chain would fail miserably.
I guess you just want to pick fights instead of trying to participate in a discussion.

TeX is open source, but there are some very clear and [distinct criteria of what you have to accomplish to make your program also called TeX]( Basically, it needs to behave exactly like TeX.
If someone writes software that behaves different than TeX and tried to brand it as TeX they could sue.
I am not a lawyer however, so I am not sure what the specific licensing criteria applies to the software license used by the bitcoin project.

huh? You have never worked in a science setting I might understand.
Usually, we maintain the words from original papers, even if they don't reflect the situation better. To make all work consistent. (Which is why stars are ordered as OBANGKM, instead of ABCDEFG)
The bitcoin whitepaper states on its premise "longest chain" as follows:


events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. 
Therefore, in the bitcoin whitepaper, "longest chain" is indeed **defined** to mean the chain with the most work. (And it is indeed done in that way in the code that comes with the paper, the bitcoin validation protocol).
Therefore, in the context that we are talking about, which is, "longest" in terms of blockchain, both are equivalent.
I am confused, do you disagree with the statement:


If you do, you are going against the first paragraph of the whitepaper
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:24:40
Maintaining the wording of an original paper doesn't mean "ad hominem". We tend to want words to have consistent meaning. We still call some particles Neutrino, even though now we know they are not a small neutron (-ino is the prefix for "small" in latin)
3. First, how can you calculate which has the largest pool of CPU power? Perhaps, by adding the cumulative work... maybe?
2. Second, How is "longer" defined in the code that came with that paper? Perhaps, as the cumulative work added... maybe?
The bitcoin network IS the longest network. Longest in this context doesn't mean "most blocks" unfortunately, as it certainly causes misunderstanding, as you are having right now.
In any case, this conversation is over. You seem to be taking it personally, instead of following a normal discussion, which I can't accept
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:52:03
 I run an old Core node, I'll see Lightning transactions too?
If you run an old software, you won't be able to use the new transaction methodology that prevents transaction malleability, since that is part of the new code. You will still see all transactions going through the network.
nonetheless, **Nobody sees lightning transactions**. Lightning "transactions" are simply bitcoin scripts:
- If nobody is cheating, they just look like normal 2 on 2 multisig. 
- If someone is cheating, the script looks a bit more complicated.
What Segwit allowed is monitoring the bitcoin network by only requiring the transaction ID of what you are trying to monitor, rather than having to read each transaction, finding out what script corresponds to it, and deciding whether that looks like it might be from a lightning channel you are monitoring or not.
 Why can't Bitcoin Cash support SegWit transactions if they're just a soft fork?
They don't support segwit because of politics, they could implement it tomorrow if they really wanted... it wouldn't take a lot of effort, everything is already coded already.
However, they have been claiming for a long time that segwit is insecure, flawed, etc... So they will probably fix malleability at some point with their own solution.
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:02:00
Your point?
A person using that old version, without following any politics could keep advancing on the github project branch until it find a client that doesn't get stuck.
Hence, without politics, he would reach the tautological conclusion that bitcoin is bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:11:22
A few things that should be added:
 Bitcoin **softforked**, 
Which means that they did a backwards compatible change. Hence, if you had downloaded any full node software BEFORE the fork, and didn't follow any politics or news, your node software would still work and it would be interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain.
Between the changes:
1. They reorganized how the network stores signature information for newer transaction, preventing something called Transaction malleability (This is what they call segwit, *segregated witness*)
    That is, they removed the ability to copy a transaction someone else made and modify it slightly, keeping the signatures valid. Which was a major security hole and a major pain if you want to develop any kind of automated interaction.
    Lightning is one of those such applications that relays on automation working well. You could make lightning work without that fix, but it would have been a huge pain to program. 
2. Also, they used that opportunity to increase the block size weighting the new information different on a block "total size".
 Bitcoin Cash **hardforked**,
