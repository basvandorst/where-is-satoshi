Most of all I’m most confident that BTC, crypto currency and blockchain tech IS the future and I’m so proud to be part of it! I know it’ll be worth it in the end:)

There are two versions of MuSig, which vary based on the number of communication rounds. Both are provably secure, but three-round MuSig only relies on the Discrete Logarithm (DL) assumption, which ECDSA also relies on. Two-round MuSig instead relies on the slightly stronger One-More Discrete Logarithm (OMDL) assumption.

What is this all about?
Blockchains are slow.Why Blockchains are slow?
Think of a Blockchain as a register.Wait a minute, transaction fee?
Yes, there’s an additional fee.So what is Lightning Network again?
The idea behind LN is that not all transactions are required to be recorded on the Blockchain.And what are those payment channels?
It’s like a safety deposit box where two people deposit equal amounts of money and each put a lock on it.
Got it, so how does it actually work?
LN works by moving the value from the ownership of the Bitcoins to the promise of ownership of the Bitcoins.

Correction: a block can currently contain 1MB of data. Originally, there was no limit, but at some point the 1MB limit was added to prevent DOS attacks. It was never intended to be permanent and can be increased or removed entirely if necessary (I think Gavin said the limit would be raised once pruning is implemented).

cryptocurrency projects are even more accessible than the rest of tech because most of the code is open source, but unlike most open source projects, if you just jump in and start doing things you'll also most likely find a way to be compensated.

It's funny how some people are so strongly opposed to Segwit2x, bet everything on the lightning network. but then don't even care too much the actual timeline. LN will likely take several years before reaching 1 million users.﻿

But they do think it's fair to draw some parallels, as Bitcoin is also very disruptive, misunderstood, and requires a lot of infrastructure development. Thanks for the love though!

And he is so mind blind that he doesn't know admitting this on Twitter confirms our suspicions about it, completely destroys it's message forever, and also tells us they are running a propaganda campaign. Not smart!

Long time bitcoin buyers and HODLers knew this already for a long period while zerohedge laughed at us. Now zerohedge is capitulating?

Virtual currencies are a natural outcome of blockchain technology. We may ban them, we may welcome them. It is trendy to urge people not to play with them. But they are a fact of our life,” said Gref, at a meeting of the Russian entrepreneurs association.

If you choose to denominate the price of energy in bitcoin  then you're right. Choosing to denominate energy prices in bitcoin, essentially begs the question.

The "fork" between Bitcoin segwit and Bitcoin Cash is really about this difference. Bitcoin Cash only made a tiny change to the Bitcoin code while Bitcoin segwit fundamentally changed the code and also had the intent to make changes in the future easier.

Very interesting, not sure that companies will host nodes with their own hardware though. 
Also the audio quality could be better, it sounds like sound is captured from your laptop's microphone and not from the on your shirt. Or maybe you're in a small room with no furniture?﻿

The elevator pitch that Digital Bitbox gives to potential buyers is that it is open-source, minimalist, Swiss made hardware wallet which has a stand-alone software wallet. It enhances users privacy with Tor and Tails compatibility. Furthermore, device private keys are immediately backed-up on a microSD card, so there’s no need to write them down. It allows users to quickly backup multiple private keys and manages them efficiently.

Bitcoin is sustainable, but it’s in danger. Increasing transaction costs and volatility are a hot topic in Bitcoin communities, but there is a larger issue at play.

There might only be 4btc of value there now, but if the cost of transactions rises again the amount of value on the lightning network will grow exponentially.
