I agree with you. And "perfect" was an overstatement. The point that I'm making is that if this solely was a technology project, we would be further along. Of course that's not possible

There's better arguments than "Bitcoin is just as bad as Visa, and that's working"

What are the origins of this little guy. I chuckle every time I see him, no matter what direction he's going

Im sure there's a better answer but if I were you I would download an [earlier version]( I would next try to get a hold of the private key and then start using the updated wallet of your choice.

I feel like a slowly boiled frog. Imagine how even more ridiculous this must sound to people not in this space?

Ah OK, that clears it up. It's still a risk question though, [read this]( 
To give a comparison, Exchanges will typical wait for 6 confirmation before they accept any sum. If you don't know what that means, a confirmation will _typically_ take 10 minutes each, so on average 1 hour. 
Like I said the typical example of a coffee shop wouldn't wait since the chances of the transaction not going through is rare after 1-2 confirmations. 
So it depends on your business and risk tolerance.

There's no data for this, but speculate on people who just held bitcoin vs the ones who traded it early days. I have my opinions. 
Who do you think made out? Also think who had the ~~mindset~~ balls to achieve success.

I'm going to keep a tab open to support them
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:12:53


What do you mean by this? This is a risk question. A cup of coffee you wouldn't wait at all, if it's a large sum, you'll want to wait an hour 1+


Do you mean customers? Why would employees need a conversion?

What's annoying as someone who's been in the bitcoin community for a bit is that the news cycle is the same. "China Ban's Bitcoin". That's the take away regardless of who's fault it is, or details. 
[Look at this Bloomberg article]( from _2013_!
It could be mistaken for an article today. That's the takeaway. As a HODLr it doesn't bother me as much, but even so I just wish there was some clear, definitive decisions on their stance.

This is brilliant and transparent. What's the fuss about?

I'm not understanding something
- Can a majority amount of "malicious" nodes enter an "invalid" transaction as "valid" in the mempool?
- If so, can a majority of legitimate miners confirm that transaction in a block? 
If either answer to the above is "no". What would be the purpose of spamming/controlling a majority amount of nodes?

I love reading stuff like this, there should be a thread dedicated to it
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:20:47
Exactly my belief as well

[Dude, you're getting BTC](

Can’t name five; there is so much innovation right now I literally do not have time to understand everything. And sometimes the best doesn’t win – it’s what people follow. I think Ethereum is the contender even though other projects seem more interesting/innovative. I think it has enough 3rd party support, core support, exposure, and use case advantage. That said, I still think BTC will stay on top. 
No one knows so all opinions are flawed in some way. BTC is the defacto, secure chain. My opinion Its purpose will become store of value alone – nothing else. It’s easier to implement a new technology than getting enough consensus of this magnitude to keep up with others. As we know a small scaling step has taken years. Not spreading FUD or a shill – I hodl BTC

Cool, thanks. That makes sense and seems smarter than [What Actually Happaned](

I leave my silverware in the dishwasher, is it safe after August 1st? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:31:02
Yes. You're going to have to do some reading up. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:32:49
Because after August 1st the BTC block chain will be hard forked to another chain called "Bitcoin Cash" that could be of some value. You'll need to form your own opinion if that is worth acting on, along with many other implications this may have on the space. 
Since you control your private key (i.e your paper wallet), your same funds will be accessible in this separate chain. Those funds will have their own value dependent on the community/market for that separate chain. 
Edit: The reason why I make this point is that several exchanges are choosing not to support this secondary chain called "Bitcoin cash". So the consequence of leaving BTC on an Exchange is that you will not have control of the forked chain. 
TLDR: Yes
 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:46:55
Genuinely curious - what would be the advantage of setting up an Exchange? So tracked BTC goes back to a company instead of an individual? Wouldn't tumbling the BTC and/or using other exchanges be sufficient?
