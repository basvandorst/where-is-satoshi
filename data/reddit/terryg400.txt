I agree with you, maybe it wasn't the clearest way of demonstrating what I am trying to show. I should have just plotted y=x^2 against y=2^x or something.

Have you tried reading it?

Right, exactly. That's why when you plot an exponential function on a logarithmic scale, you get a straight line. When you plot y=x^2 on a logarithmic scale (see the chart on the left hand side of my screenshot), you don't get a straight line, because y=x^2 is not exponential. It grows more slowly than an exponential function.


This sentence might make sense if it weren't for the fact that **v=u^2 is not exponential**. You've said multiple times in this thread that Metcalfe's law is exponential, and multiple times given a not-at-all-exponential equation as evidence, what am I supposed to conclude other than that you don't know what "exponential" means?
On the other hand if you plot Bitcoin's price on a logarithmic scale you also don't get a straight line, you get a graph that *still looks exponential*. Who knows what's causing that, but you're arguing that Bitcoin's much-faster-than-exponential growth can be explained by a much-slower-than-exponential relationship like Metcalfe's law. It doesn't make a lot of sense.

Well, I joined this thread to refute the poster above's factually incorrect statement that Metcalfe's law implies  "valuation rises exponentially compared to the user growth" (&lt;-- verbatim quote). I don't have to make any assumptions about how to model bitcoin's price to do that, it's just an issue with his understanding of the math he's so vigorously explaining to others.
As it happens, I think it's appropriate to model the user growth as exponential, but that model still [doesn't really work](
This is a completely pointless exercise because we don't knows what rate the users are growing at, maybe it's faster than exponential, and we're not going to be able to model bitcoin's price with a simple formula in one variable anyway - but as I said, I'm just here because I was bothered by the implication that v=u^2 could, in-and-of-itself, explain the mega-explosive growth of bitcoin prices recently.

*f(x)* means a function in *x*. This means that in *f(x)=b^x*,  *x* is the input variable (the thing that changes) and *b* is some constant.
*v=u^2* is the other way around, where the input variable is raised to the power of some constant, e.g. *f(x)=x^n*. Functions like this are called polynomials, and when *n=2* we call them quadratics ("quadratus" is Latin for square). The inverse of squaring is taking the square root, remember.
Exponentials are much, much faster-growing than polynomials. That's why polynomials look like their growth is slowing down when you view them on a log scale, while (because taking  a logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation) exponentials will plot a straight line on a log scale. Bitcoin's growth seems to be speeding up even when plotted on a log scale! This tells us that it's growing *even faster than exponentially* (that's pretty damn fast).

This whole argument is irrelevant because you don't seem to know what the word "exponential" means. [Look at y=x^2 on a log scale on your favourite online graphing calculator and compare to bitcoin's growth in price](
