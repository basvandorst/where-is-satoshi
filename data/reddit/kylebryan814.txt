I might as well have from all the fees I’m looking at paying. The average trezor wallet on amazon is almost double the cost of an actual trezor wallet.

True. That would make more sense.

I haven’t seen any option for Coinbase to send lower priority. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:52:32
I wasn’t trying to get around anything. I’ve lived in a few places over the last few years.

Did that, and it says my account has restricted access and I need to complete my account. I can’t do that because it says I don’t live at my address and when attempting to put another address on there it denied that as well and locked out trying to do that for the next 24 hours. Quite annoying.

The GDAX website has you complete the account by entering your information. I already have a Coinbase account but GDAX still makes you enter all of your information.

I get that but I’m trying to get the best deals for today. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:41:43
Like I said in the post, I tried that but its website wouldn’t let me create an account because apparently I’m not who I say I am. Said my address was wrong when I think I’d know if it was right or wrong.

You’re right. It’s just annoying that purchasing items with bitcoin right now aren’t smooth as they should be. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:54:50
But you aren’t thinking about the average person who is obtaining bitcoin. Things like this? (Even though this is Coinbase’s fault) Coinbase is by far the most user friendly bitcoin exchange hands down. Things like my situation are possibilities the average user could fall into. Bitcoin is suppose to be a currency and exchanges like Coinbase are making it impossible for bitcoin to adapt. Now people can downvote me all they want, but that’s reality. Especially with how fast bitcoin is gaining traction more and more people are going to get involved and if it’s not smooth for them, then why would they keep using it? It’s easier to buy with fiat.

It does help when you put it that way. I don’t know. I just get anxiety at seeing that big number drop more after buying at a higher price even though it’s $10-15 difference.

Interesting. I was unaware of it increasing that much. Is there a place to see when and where the difficulty goes up?

With the difficulty getting so insane, what's the infrastructure of bitcoin going to be when people start shutting off their miners due to not getting a profit?

Makes sense. Thank you for the quick reply!
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:29:51
Well it could be that people diversify their mining operations. They could put multiple stakes into each different crypto mine and eventually net a decent enough profit. I remember watching a video of this kid who cloud mined and was generating about $3,500 a month from renting all kinds of crypto miners. Granted that was 2 years ago I believe. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:24:51
I didn't search too much into mining other cryptos but from the brief searching and putting the cost to rent/mine for the other currencies, nothing really could turn into a sizable profit. At least not comparable to how much bitcoin mining is profitable. I believe I looked at ETH mining, LTC mining and Scrypt mining. None seemed very profitable for how much it would cost to rent. Some I believe would only net a few hundred dollars. Once again, it's not taking mining difficulty into account. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:37:32
Interesting. I understood the fees part, but never thought mining would get to the point of not profitable. Just goes to show bitcoin is crazy as shit 24/7. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:18:44
Well it looks like only time will tell. Surely with all the new info I was provided with changes things, but I guess we will find out. At this point, I'd be perfectly fine breaking even. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:17:52
Thank you! I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:23:10
Good. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:27:11
I FUCKED UP
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:12:13
I didn’t have enough money to buy anymore at a discount...and I get my tax returns tomorrow while bitcoin is having a surge...just my luck
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:48:53
Wow awesome work. You even have the LIFE coin on the app. This just replaced Blockfolio. Congrats!
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:38:43
Also never said I wanted to be a millionaire, haha. I just don’t want to see red for 4 months straight. Is that so difficult? I’m not looking for it to go up to 20k but holy shit, how hard is it to stay at 8k? Even before the rise, 7k-8k was pretty firm now it’s starting to become normal to see it back down to 6k again. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:06:13
I’m really getting kind of annoyed at all the cock throbbing “you don’t like the tech bro?” type people. We put money into this so called tech and all it’s doing is shitting the bed. We are allowed to be angry and you can shut the fuck up about the tech, because yeah sure, it sounds great, but I’m still pissed I’m losing money now. Should I be like, “hell yeah! Still in the red since December! I love bitcoin!” Because no thank you. I’m allowed to be salty. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:11:11
Why do you assume I bought at the top? I bought bitcoin at multiple intervals since 4K. It’s shitting the bed, and you’re in denial. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:44:56
I work at an IT company where we had some end users call in about this exact email. Shit was crazy.
