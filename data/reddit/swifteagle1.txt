$10,000 rejected.... 
I guess the psychological level of $10,000 is not quite ready to be broken. I see no fundamental changes in the market. I would assume that we back up and get another run and go at it. Which as much as I wanted to see it break it is probably a healthy thing going forward long term.
I will say this also. The sell back volume was not as great as one would think. Which leads me to believe that the price can and will easily resume it's upward trend.
We will see.

Thats almost 1 million $$$ at the moment. Sorry man. That story even makes me hurt!

On top of this.....I think the "Really Big Money Guys" will soon increase their allotment action.
Especially as more resistance levels fall.
This could happen rather quickly.

Well, that back and forth market depth is fun to watch on gdax at the moment. Got my pop corn and drink.

Let's see $500 a day for the next week or two.

Although anything is possible.

I'd say by the time I go to bed tonight is very likely.

This fact tells me that the alts will go even higher once BCH can be cashed out.

And when more of the planet comes on board, $3400 will be cheap. There will be a lot b of "could've -should've--would've" thinking going on.

The "real" Naka is English. You know...England...
Although I do indeed love the concept. People will still be hunting even after Bitcoin is as common as dead American presidents.

BCC....nice honest atempt. But can't compete at this point in time.  So no. BCC will not get my value.

I wish someone would spend on me. :)
 I'm 57 with a mortgage, wife, 12 yr old son. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:32:59
I will....in controlled fashion.

Time will tell will it not? Man your stations and firm up in your beliefs. ...
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:40:31
Do you know it will dip a great deal further? 
I dont.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:30:37
Hate it and love it at the same time. :)
Providing you your timing even close.

That could change as world public grows more aware.

Such drama....from my phone auto correct.. .whatever.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:41:03
That is correct. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:17:25
Thank you very much for that post. That explained it pretty well. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:31:44
It will not take 2 weeks. Imho.
