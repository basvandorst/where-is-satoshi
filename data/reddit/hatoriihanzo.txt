I was at the mall one day and walked by one of those cellphone booths, the cute girl tried selling me a screen protector for $50. I told her I still used a flip phone, she gave me a dumb ass looked and ignored me from then on.

HODLING? F that I’m buying more. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:41:49
Buy the dip? F that, buy the fuckin crash!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:18
It has gone up at least 2k every morning when I check the prices, I could’ve sworn it was at 9k last week. I expect a crash soon and once it does I’ll buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:31
Guys I’m scared, someone please HODL me. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:43:54
This sounds like something Tai Lopez would say. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:16:14
So what you’re saying is that I should buy and HODL?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:14:38
Pfft once it crashes I’m gonna buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:17
Guys I’m scared, someone please HODL me. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:35:31
At work sitting here at my desk and I can’t even focus with all the craziness going on with the price going up, down, spinning all around. Now I can’t even log into my coinbase account. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:57:11
I bought more when it dipped to $13,500 last night. Woke up this morning and saw that it was at $11,000 proceeded to buy even more while half asleep ��
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:13:03
Boy I’m glad I bought more during the 30% off Christmas sale. To the moon we go!
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:04:02
Invested $14 the other day into bitcoin, 24 hours later it’s at $25.60. Yeah I’m not sure how they do that 9-5 everyday. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:05:53
Well at least this won’t be as bad as that guy who ate his own testicle. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:06:45
Bitcoin needs to stop with these holiday sale prices. The holidays are already over, if they keep this up I’m gonna be tempted to buy more ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:11:23
Very true, I barely got in at the beginning of this month. I plan to keep buying when I can, hopefully in a year it goes up even more. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:48:21
Woke up this morning and saw that my $100 of bitcoin jumped up to $110, now after seeing this post I feel sad again. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:23:02
What's the other sub?
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:06:48
RemindMe! 7days
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:24:45
Newcomer here and I don't own any coins as if yet. So if I buy $100 worth right now would it be wise to keep it on Coinbase? Some were telling me since the amount is so little I'll be fine, but some of the posts here suggest to move it right away. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:09:13
Okay so do we buy right now or wait?
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:27:25
What are the pros and cons of choosing a bank account over a debit for buying on coinbase? I️ know debit has higher fees, and is instant, versus a bank account with lower fees and takes a few days. But is there anything else I’m missing here.

I bought the Sennheiser game one for my Xbox one and PS4. They’re pretty good, also told myself I’m never going back to turtle beaches ever again. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:28:30
Yeah because why not.. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:48:15
Bought some last night ��
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:20:32
Same with me. I remember reading a bitcoin article back in 2012 when it was really cheap. I didn’t think anything of it and here I am now regretting it. I managed to get in at $3500 but I wish I did way earlier. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:33:44
What sites did you use to bet? I wanted to bet my 100 on the Conor/Mayweather fight but all the sites looked shady. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:06:37
It would be nice if people stop panic selling. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:29:24
I feel like a hipster every time I come to this sub. Now where's my MacBook Pro, Starbucks, and clear wayfarers
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:32:33
Unless you leave it on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:08:41
Buy the dips!
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:23:14
No idea, are you planning to keep it on the exchange or did you already move to a wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:39:29
So it’s pretty much this
TLDR: BUY THE FUCKING DIPS!
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:58:01
Same, I got in when the price was $3500 and only bought $100 USD worth. But now I’m sitting at $140 so it ain’t bad, plus having some bitcoin is better than not having any at all.

I bought my first bitcoin on coinbase and I see a lot of people saying use gdax which I will soon. But does anyone here have experience with buying on bread wallet? I plan to transfer my coins there eventually. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:30:55
So is gdax a wallet like bread wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:07:05
So if I started buying on gdax and then transferring to bread wallet the fees will be cheaper? I’m currently using Coinbase and then going from there.
