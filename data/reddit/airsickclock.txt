why is it so much higher than the normal price, i guess i wont buy off paxful
@_date: 2019-07-04 08:08:49
So if I buy it at $13 500 and the original BTC price is $11 000, how would that work, would I only make a profit if the original BTC price reaches more than $13 500, thats what I struggle to understand
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:59:54
all it means is that its time to buy more

What other secure methods besides paper backups can i use? A encrypted file with them? i have no idea
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:22:57
Simple calculator : 
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:40:55
Alright thanks I'll set it up soon.
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:38:53
I also wanted to make sure that buying Bitcoin from a site where the rate per bitcoin is low will be more profitable than buying it at a higher rate correct? ( For example Paxful)

I just wanted to make sure that buying Bitcoin from a site where the rate per bitcoin is low will be more profitable than buying it at a higher rate correct? ( For example Paxful where the rate is the lowest will be more profitable when it increases?) I'm still trying to figure this out
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:08:14
So if someone was to try to access my account, that person just needs my private key or the seed to use my BTC, across software wallet. Also what other software wallets are there and what about storing it online? Like on a website
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:14:07
Ahh thank you, so what's the difference from using a software wallet to using an online wallet stored on the internet?  I'll check that link out now
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:52:38
Never thought about that, thanks so much for your help. Just transferred it and waiting for it to confirm
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:20:56
Guys do I buy $20 worth at 11.7k
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:06:35
Ohh I understand, so the balance will show up in all the wallets I use and whichever wallet I use to make a payment, it would use that specific fees, for example it wouldn't use exodus fees if I'm paying with electrum.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:18:14
I have version 3.3.6 but i got it from electrum.org, am i good?
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:11:31
How do I send from exodus to Electrum? I tried importing my 12 word but it still shows my balance in exodus, I'm not sure what's supposed to happen or if it's worth it to put it in Electrum(Because of exodus high fees)
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:38:00
Think i'll just wait thanks, do you know of other wallets that are reliable and don't have such bad fees?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:44:12
Im still new so idk how it really works , but I can buy off paxful with PAYPAL, is that fine?
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:11:09
Thanks for clearing that up, I'll check it out now
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:26:16
Alright thanks, Also if you could clear something up for me i'd appreciate it. I have about $20 in Exodus wallet which a friend just gave me randomly and I didn't know much about (Still don't) But when I try to send the money it gives me a fee of nearly 50% (About $9) which is ridiculous. Why is this? How can I send it to another wallet , such as Luno without having to pay alot in fees.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:43:39
If I buy bitcoin with payapl off paxful, how will i know at what price i bought Bitcoin? Is it the rate per bitcoin that says at which price i bought it? I'm not sure
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:08:32
Cant do that in exodus as far as im aware, Another wallet like electrum? What exactly will that do, won't there still be a fee to transfer to the new wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:37:03
Yeah I made 2 electrum wallets and transferred the money to the one with a 50 cent fee
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:26:06
Alright I think I'll use electrum, should I be worried if I used exodus but switching to Electrum now? Also, isn't coinbase a type of a web wallet too?
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:57:33
So a block is the time period it takes to complete a transaction? The fastest  or closest block is going to be more in fees because it's kind of instant
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:03:23
Where is the best place to buy BTC? That is available in most countries ( Not from US or Uk)
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:16:28
When i use electrum and import my private key into it , is my balance in Exodus supposed to transfer into electrum? I tried it but I might have messed up because the balance showed in Exodus still when I set up electrum using my private keys
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:27:29
Whats the point of that , i dont really understand. Does it allow you to withdraw from electrum directly into a different wallet or what. I tried it but the balance still shows up in exodus .
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:08:54
Makes much more sense now ty
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:48:44
eat pant
@_date: 2019-12-07 05:02:06
So the exact same seed and I just select, bip39 and I'll have my current wallet restored again? If that's correct thanks so much for clearing it up, one more thing. Would you recommend I switch to native Segway or is there not that big of a difference for transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:23:09
I only have $25 but idk if I should buy bitcoin now, I already have $20 in BTC now but I'm Goin to be changing wallets from exodus to luno, because it's local to me, but there transfer fees are going to kill me? I think
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:29:38
This is what it shows, so I'm not sure how I would be able to recover if anything happened
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:28:56
Should I just stay using p2sh? The thing is I can't view my seed so I'm not sure how I would recover my wallet if anything happens to it besides using soft copies, I imported my seed to create this p2sh because the exchange I use supports this.
This is what it says in my electrum.
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:25:30
Thanks, I'm not sure why but on my p2sh wallet I can't seem to view my seed in electrum? 
I'm really new to btc and all and just want to be able to have a seed that I can keep incase of any damage to my computer or remove able disks. Is it normal not to be able to use the 12 word phrase on p2sh? What would you suggest I do.
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:33:22
I still have my seed from the previous wallet that I imported from, should I just send it back there where I have access to the seed.
Also, i don't recall seeing any seed when creating the p2sh because I imported the previous seed, does this mean p2sh doesn't allow for the seed recovery and only soft copies of the wallet file
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:36:38
So it's either I keep this wallet or create a new native segwit wallet.
So I'd just send the funds from the p2sh to the native segwit? What about having a seed though as that's my main concern
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:34:34
Time to buy boi
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:16:40
only have $35 in , waiting for the deposit for abit more to come through, hopefully it stays at this level for a bit.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:55:42
So do I make a new wallet ( Legacy) and send it there? Then back to the Segwit wallet? What about fees that way
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:26:19
Yeah it's all i have to spare for BTC, but this exchange im using(Luno) takes about a day for deposits which sucks so hard
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:25:13
I'm new to all of this sorry, do you mean placing buy orders very low and just waiting for the heavy drop ? I want to buy       some but not sure whether to weight or buy now.
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:20:35
I see, thanks I'll look into that, maybe i could do it weekly too?
@_date: 2019-09-29 09:18:50
Thanks I'll do it rn
