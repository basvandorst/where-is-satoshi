How do you buy alts then? You use BTC most if the time.
How is the $ price of a alt determined? Same, by going [ALT]=&gt;BTC=&gt;$.
That´s also the reason why Bitcoin is one of the base pairs on crypto listing sites, because it´s the base currency right now.

Ethereum is facing the same issues all blockchains face once they´re actualy heavily used. 
That´s why both bitcoin and ethereum are heading the 2nd Layer way, the only actualy known solution to the problem that i know of. Also, Ethereum is playing with a PoW / PoS hybrid system which i don´t like at all, but at least something is done.

The ICO was planned for a long time, aswell as the official German banking licence.
The message translates to: This is not working without a banking licence, until we have one there won't be a Visa card or SEPA transfers.
SHOULD they succeed this is amazing since you could get a official bank account that is handled in BTC, only converting to € the moment you spend. No more prepaid card required.
I'm staying sceptical but really wish they reach their vision.

There's a simple reason why BCH is not Bitcoin.
There can only be 1 valid Bitcoin chain at any time. The white paper and the original Bitcoin code has a simple rule to figure out which chain is the valid one: The one with the most work done.
That's BTC without any contest, BCH has &lt; 10% of the work done.
BCH changed that rule to actually survive as minority chain not supported by the network.

He's talking about how Blockstream would benefit from fees and conspiracy stuff. That's no argument against LN it's story time. Beside that, I fail to see how Blockstream would earn any more fees then other LN nodes. It's made-up bullshit.
As for actual problems and issues addressed by you: We will have to see how it plays out and learn from that. Remember that LN does in no way replace or hurt the Bitcoin Block chain. Worst case is it fails, no blocks will be harmed.
We either do that or go down the block size road knowing it won't scale to the levels we will need or we actually try promising solutions that are required anyway.
One more sidenote: I think most of the LN discussion is too focused on "Bill buys a coffee" Szenarios. The real interesting and promising part is that it creates a trustless network on top of the chain enabling atomic swaps and trustless exchanges. 
The later ones are already 2nd tier solutions, 3rd party stuff owned by companies. I would prefer a protocol like LN to handle this instead of trusting exchanges - it's no different then trusting banks.

If you want to disapear, you close the channel and therefor broadcasting the bitcoin closing TX with the correct balance.
If you´re not able to watch the channel you could outsource that. It´s important to note that what needs to be monitored is the blockchain, more specific the closing transaction.

Because too many people don´t get Bitcoin at all. Everything is about high fees and conspiracies now and smart business men are using that to their benefit. Not a single cryptocurrency is ready for mass adaption, anyone telling you otherwise is probably selling you their coin. 
As for Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash: Just because the later is the loudest and owns the company behind bitcoin.com does not make it any bigger then it actualy is. Check out statistics on pricing, transaction volume, development activity and hashrates. This will paint a very clear picture with some objective facts instread of the trump style campaining going on here and on twitter.

Think of LN transaction as a balance sheet, signed by 2 parties. Those parties are you and your channel partner. The sheet is a actual Bitcoin transaction and can only be altered when both parties agree on it and sign the tx. 
When you send money to your channel patner (or anyone on the network) you update the balance sheet which is again signed by both of you (or not, if one disagrees). This tx can be broadcasted to the Bitcoin network at any time, by any of you 2, just like a regular multisig tx that then get´s included in the blockchain. 
If you use nodes to route your payment, they don´t know who is sending money and they don´t know the recipient. Neither can they alter the tx, just like minders can´t alter your tx today.

I don´t like PoS and don´t think it can work in a secure way like PoW does for years already. I might be wrong, it´s just a semi qualified opinion based on what i learned.
Two example for a theoretical PoS weakness:
Imagine Bitcoin was PoS. A hard fork happens, creating 2 seperate chains, let´s call them Chain1 and Chain2. All Stakeholders now have equal amounts of coins on both chains. 
You now have equal PoS voting rights on both chains. In a PoW System one has to decide what chain to follow, can´t mine both. In a PoS you don´t have to, you can manipulate the chain you dislike with your airdrops.
Another szenario: A big exchange (equals big stakeholder since they go alot tokens) get´s hacked. In the worst case, the hacker can now manipulate all PoS coins using the stolen tokens. He could potentially ruin a cryptocurrency without any investment at all. 
That´s not possible when you actually need to do work (PoW) to impact anything.

You don't need to trust anyone.
If a 3rd Party watches for old channel states beeing published, he does not know who he's watching for. 
All he knows is: I have this Transaction here, if any older one gets published, I'll counter that and get a fee in return. 
You can pay for the service because you get all money from the channel if the other party is trying to cheat.

Missed your comment.
You're correct, the rule does not apply here making my comment void and maybe bit trollish :)
I would rephrase it:
The work done on a chain shows which chain is supported by a majority of the mining power / the bigger network. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:24:48


That´s why node operators can charge a fee as compensation for the cost of running a node and locking funds. This Fee is a % of the transaction volume and should therefor work well even for small amounts. If the fee is too hight nobody will use the node, that in return creates a LN fee market.
Also, i don´t think we´ll see too many nodes that ONLY act as relay. Exchanges and large resellers will probably run nodes with large funds in them. Not to support the network but to send and recieve funds just like everyone else. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:58:09
Because SegWit was implemented already and they hoped that the GUI can be handled by those that want to Profite. 
GUIs are the last thing you care about as protocol developer since it can be done by others.
Bitcoin core only has a finite number of developers and there are more important problems then a missing SegWit GUI in a full node. Don't forget that Bitcoin is not only about Bitcoin Core and slot wallets and services implemented SebWit already as they should, by themselves, just like W3C won't implement my new Website for me.
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:27:57
I was referring to the Bitcoin value transfered, the USD transfered follows the price, just compare BTC/USD with the USD transfered chart.
It'll be interesting to see how this plays out, most likely the volume will increase again when  ppl realize how low the fees are, resulting in higher fees and decline in mempool volume.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:05:55

The mainnet LN is a early test by enthusiasts that´re not afraid to loose money. The software is not officialy ready for mainnet yet, that´s why you don´t see a hype. Remember this is not ebay.com where new features are acitvated by a company, instead it will grow slowly once ready and everyone can help on that by participating, running nodes and using LN.
Realisticly, until the software is considered stable enought and a LN formed on mainnet, you´ll wait at least 3-6 months. There´s still alot to learn by trial &amp; error espacialy for businesses that want to adopt LN.

Pruning always requires a full download, section 7 says just that since otherwise it's effectively a SPV Wallet (section 8), not a full node. Your full node needs to see and verify the full chain, no way around that.
When you activate pruning the raw block data for blocks &gt; limit is deleted for old blocks but the metadata including the Merkle tree is preserved along with all unspend outputs.  So it's just what you describe. 
Feel free to correct me if I got anything wrong.

The actual value transfered hasn't changed much, only the transaction count. You can check that on any statistic site.
So it's used just as much as around Nov / start of Dez but more efficient. Fee pressure caused optimizations.

I´ll rather exchange my money for a crypto backed by 98% hashpower that secures it then having fast / cheap tx and only 2-4% hashpower like some glorious alts. Do you understand the implications of so little hashpower?
If security is not a issue for you, use something else. Otherwise, use the most secure network and accept that hypes like this one will make it expensive. It´s not like nothing is done about it, there´re countless independent projects working on solutions on top of bitcoin.
The current fees / mempool size is bananas, no argument about that, but i accept that for now.

Because there was no correction yet and futures will launch in a few days. Every broker that invests in BTC  futures wants the price to fall since that's what makes them money.

The fee is set to 65sat/byte, that's probably too low to go through next few days. Note that it's a rather big transaction at near 3kb, hence th high fee.
Try this:
- Replace-by-fee enabled? Just increase the fee then
- If not, use child-pays-for-parent (Google it for instructions) if possible. If this is a exchange transaction you might be out of luck since you can't hand-craft transactions then.

When you mean the software and development teams, Bitcoin is developed for 9 years by 400+ contributors while Bitcoin Cash is a clone of that software developer by mainly 2 guys. 
Also, people like to say BCH is decentralized in development because there are multiple implementations. That's a straw man argument since core is not the only Bitcoin implementations either...it's about the reference implementations and that's Bitcoin Core vs. BitcoinABC.
Check out the repositories and make up your mind:

BitcoinABC is not on GitHub (only a mirror there).

Size of the transaction or weight for SegWit, inputs are only a part of that.
A standard transaction has one input and 2 outputs. If we're talking about massive batch transaction or consultation it's a different story...
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:54:46
There´s no simple answer to this unfortunatly.
I would recommend some history lesson, start here: [Satoshi´s post about the block size limit](  (read the follow ups that pop-up 2 years later in that thread)
Blocksize increases requires a hard fork which is extremly hard to get right on a **existing coin that is used already**. There´s no way back, once blocks are bigger you can´t shrink them. Once the Blockchain get´s bloated by ineffective transactions they will stay forever. The argument that technologie grows faster then Bitcoin is simply naive and oversimplyfied imho. 
Core Developers agree that blockchain space is limited and valuable, therefor, instead of opening the flood gate, measures are taken to make transactions more efficent and to create incentives for using off-chain solutions for small payments - again to save space and enable micro-payments.
You will never see REAL micro payments on a global blockchain. It simply can´t happen. I´m not even talking about a coffee here, i´m talking about 0.00001 € transactions between 2 devices, for example.

This guy get´s it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:34:05
1. Check the legend on the left
2. Look for the sat/byte you set for your transacions and click it
3. Your fee is not the bottom of the chart
4. Did your color "shrink" in the chart? If not, fee was too low
Right now, you´ll need about 100+sat/byte for a confirmation. Everything lower takes time or might not get confirmed at all.
To find a appropriate fee:
1. Do the same as above, but use the fee you plan to set
2. Did the color "shrink" the last 1-2h? If not, set a higher fee
Remark: This does not work for SegWit transations since they use weight instead of bytes for the fee calculation.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:26:04
1 confirmation means your transaction has been included in a block / in the blockchain.
6 confirmations mean that it has been included and 5 more blocks have been mined on top of it, making it essentaly immutable.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:54:58
10kb? That's bananas indeed - it's about 40×the size of a normal transaction and transfered 20 BTC. Looks like a big exchange batch transaction.
1030 / 40 = 32$ - that's a high fee indeed but doesn't look as dramatic as 1800$...
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:04:00

@_date: 2017-12-26 21:35:26


Not sure what you mean by that. The White paper always assumes one valid chain and only defines which one that is (most work done). Minority forks like BCH or BCG change that rule to actually survive since by definition, they should be dropped since they are no longer the valid chain.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:57:58
It´s not mostly a bandwidth problem, you´ll need nearly the same connection speed given the same number of transactions (same size) no matter how big the block size is. One could even argue big blocks safe bandwidth since there´s less overhead (e.g. block header) compared to small blocks.
The problem is that bigger blocks need more cpu and ram to validate. That´s the limiting factor here. 8MB won´t cause problems here either, but using blocksize as scaling method does mid to long term.

Bitcoin won't scale without a block size increase.
 It's about priorities and stability, better ask ppl **when** they think a increase is appropriate.
For me, reducing transaction size and establishing 2nd tier solutions comes first, then we can start increasing the blocksize.
Maximum blocksize (2 years horizon) would be ~4-32mb imo. Don't think the network can handle more for now, not talking about lab tests of course.
Don't forget how difficult a block size increase is, it requires a hard fork which is a perfect attack vector for takeover attempts.

Today we´ve exchanges with their own infrastructure. Instead of that, they could become big lighning nodes, build directly on the Bitcoin chain. You can do fast trasactions on the exchange, between exchanges, even beween LN enabled coins like BTC and LTC. 
Exchanges can´t just take your money anymore, nor can you loose funds when it get´s hacked. You can use the channel to one or more exchanges as super hubs to the LN. Exchanges don´t need more trust that way, they need less / next to none.
Without 2nd layer solutions exchanges will always stay a trusted 3rd party with legacy software behind the scenes.

The number of inputs and outputs, mainly. 
Imagine you start with 1 BTC in one address. You send 1 BTC to someone else. That's one transaction with 1 Input (1 BTC) and 1 Output. This would be a small transaction since it only contains little data.
Now think you also have 1 BTC, but scattered around in 100 Addresses. The same transaction would now contain 100 Inputs and 1 Output. That's a huge transaction costing you tons of money.

One point that is often ignored is that it's not about which way will scale better in terms of tx/s - it's about how it affects centralization of the base layer and the general tradeoffs regarding the very foundation of Bitcoin, a globally distributed ledger with state consensus.

By mining them again on top of the altered block, effectively creating a chain split starting at the altered block. 
The attacker then needs to catch up and produce the chain with most work done. All nodes will accept that tempered chain as valid since the chain with most work done is always considered the 'valid' one. That's how the network handles orphan blocks / chain splits.

The argument that Bitcoins are not fungible because they can be tracked is nonsence imho.
A fungible asset or good is something that is easily interchangable for a currency or assets of the same type. 
The problem here is that ppl think of Bitcoin as the addresses or UTXOs containing them. This is false imo - here's why:
- Send 100 sat from 100 Adresses, 1 sat from each, to Address B
- Send 1 sat to Address C
- From which of the 100 sources did the single sat come from?
Well, you can't tell. The same way you can't track a individual $cent on a bank account, you can only track the accounts and $ movements between them.

Opening a channel is a on\-chain Transaction. In you example, it would have a 1 BTC input from the exchange and 0 BTC from the noob. 
Sending the 1 BTC to the noob is done off\-chain by updating the channel close transaction. The noob can then leave the 1 BTC in the channel, send it elsewhere \*\*using the channel he has with the exchange\*\* or simply close the channel to use it in regular on\-chain transactions.

Unless those miners run their own full node - which they don´t except for F2Pool - they´re not in control of the mining at all. They can shutdown or change the pool, but they´re not real miners - only workhorses with no control over the blocks / tx in the blocks.

@_date: 2018-10-11 14:31:32
All Mining Pools based on Stratum (pretty much all of them) won't let you choose your transactions. You get a blocktemplate as well as the coinbase info's and the TXS to include. 
BetterHash is a example of a pool where miners are actually mining, all Stratum pools miners basicly just hash whatever their pool sends them.

Fun fact: People on say the same about @_date: 2017-11-23 18:08:19
Nodes don't really mark transactions as invalid, they drop them and therefore don't broadcasting it.
Remember it's a P2P network. A node maintenance several in/outgoing connections to other node, they do the same. 
When I do a transaction it gets send to a node that validates it and - if it's valid - broadcasts it to the nodes it's connected to. They do the same, forming sort of a mesh network.
Miners grab those broadcasted transactions, validate them and will eventually include them in a block. That block is broadcasted to the network, nodes grab them and - if they figure it's valid - attach them to their block chain copy.
If the block is invalid and gets rejected by the network (the honest nodes), the miner won't get any reward for it. That way miners are incentivized to play by the rules and only mine valid blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:49:36
The problem with scaling by using big blocks is that it increases the hardware requirements. Currently it's 8mb for BCH. What to do when 8mb isn't enough anymore? Well, scale to 16, 32 and so on. There is no other solution proposed by BCH I am aware of. 
This takes away the very foundation of Bitcoin - which is *you do not need trust in any 2nd party* (bank, miner, ...) to use it. 
Once you can't download and verify the Blockchain yourself due to blocksize, you need to trust the big players verifying the chain for you. Welcome back to where we started.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:03:04
New features in the Bitcoin protocol are proposed using so called BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) documents (see 
Once such a BIP reaches consensus in the community it eventually gets deployed on the first nodes. Since Bitcoin is decentralized there's no way to just "update the Bitcoin network" - so to ensure network stability and avoid a chain split / fork, nodes and miners can signal if they're ready for the change.   
The change only activates if a majority of the nodes signal their support until a activation date. Therefore, all nodes can influence if a change activates or not.
Now, miners can highly influence that since they can block or enforce changes by signaling (think software version) and by mining blocks with or without the change (think 8MB blocks).

Wait till it synced up then you can move them elsewhere. I would recommend using a wallet like [Electron]( to store your coins.

It´s what makes Bitcoin a trusless P2P cash system. 
A full node has a complete and in-sync copy of the blockchain. More copies and nodes validating blocks and transactions make sure everyone plays by the rules. The ABITLITY to run a full node, validating the chain BY YOUR SELF to verify transactions are valid is the foundation of the trustless Bitcoin network.
Everything that makes it harder / more costly to run a full node will slowly transform Bitcoin into a system with centralized ledgers / blockchain where you have to trust those that actualy have the power to host a full node or miner.
The question - "Did i recieve the money" or "Is this transaction valid" would then always be answered by a 3rd Party with no way for you to verify (the ABILITY to do so).
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:48:23
Bigger Blocks will mean that less ppl can participate as  miners and big miners profit simply due to hardware requirements.
The main problem with BCH is that it does not solve any Problem, it only delays it. 
It comes down to:
- BTC wants to implement a fast Transaction Network (LN) for payments and sees the main chain as Store of value (Not PayPal 2.0)
- BCH increased the Block size to Speed up transactions
I'm a Dev myself and for me BTC decision is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:22:30
Most likely not and even if, it won't matter much. Remember that n-Tier Solutions are not there to replace the Bitcoin network in any way.
The whole point is to ensure that the Bitcoin Network stays P2P. Not only decentralized but true P2P to ensure nobody can control access to it or manipulate.
That means the block chain needs to stay at a reasonable size and blocks can't get too big. Only off-chain solutions or reduced transaction size can do that imo.

Segwit allows blocks up to 4mb (not practicaly reachable), with 100% SegWit the avarage will be arround 1.7mb.

Well, I don't think so. A established channel means the opening transaction confirmed. Before that, no Bitcoins can be locked up whatsoever. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:40:03
While I get your scenario, it can't happen that way. A channel is only established after the opening transaction confirmed. That in return can only happen when both parties sign it. That also implies both agreed and negotiated the funding.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:58:26
The initial close transaction is signed on channel opening, not when you actually want to close it. Subsequent channel updates generate new channel close transactions. That way Bitcoins can't be locked except when your software is buggy I guess.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:40:04
Of course it requires the other party to sign the transaction. There is no way to open a channel without both signing the open transaction. If you know any case where this is possible, correct me with a sound example / link.

The channel state is a bitcoin transaction, it is signed and therefor temper proof, just like any other singed tx. When you notice your channel partner is commiting a old state (tx) to the blockchain (nothing to do with LN at that point) you can prove he tries to cheat since you got a newer transaction.
That´s not the complicated stuff. Routing and the process of actually signing the messages (by both) is imo.
