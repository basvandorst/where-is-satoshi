@_date: 2018-01-05 12:52:10
That sub is so fucking dumb honestly. They are always popping up on popular and some of the stuff they share is just stupid. It's a bunch of jobless teenagers thinking that communism will suddenly give them fulfilling lives
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:47:18
What? The whole point of bitcoin was to revolutionise online payments. If your suggestion for someone that wants to use bitcoin as a currency is 'use something else' then that means you see BTC as nothing other than a pyramid scheme to get rich quick from. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:09:36
Literally the first sentence of the post is them saying they aren’t a holder. Maybe they just bought something online for $15. God forbid people use a currency for its intended purpose. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:37:58
Right but then you're ignoring every other country in the world that hasn't experienced hyperinflation

Did say I agreed with OP? No I did not. I said you’re lame for calling someone a shill as your first line of defence. Which is completely correct. I love how you countered my argument... by calling me a shill lmao

@_date: 2017-12-12 22:57:15
This thread is honestly baffling me. People like you sneering at the guy because he had a windfall and decided to cash out. He's already said it is his _entire_ net worth (as he was broke before.)
If he wants to cash out then honestly good for him. Some of us are here for the long term some are not. Being content with profit and deciding to enjoy it instead of holding it for the rest of the time isn't a bad thing. I mean yeah he could miss out on future rises but honestly, as much as the circlejerk here refuses to acknowledge it: bitcoin can crash pretty hard leaving him with nothing.
If I was broke and found a bitcoin I'd sell that shit in a heartbeat honestly. Stability &gt; Risk when you've got no money to your name
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:46:07
Yeah I do g
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:46:18
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:52:59
OP didn't say explicitly say he was going to pay all the rent off at once. Just that it's secure for the future. EG: If they loose their job tomorrow they are safe in the knowledge they won't be on the street
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:25:12
Maybe so yeah but I just get annoyed at this recent trend of crying shill every time someone disagrees with something on the internet
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:19:44
This is fucking lame. Not everybody on reddit is a paid shill when it’s convenient to you. Ironic considering you’ve only been on reddit for 3 weeks and you literally have bot in your name
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:10:04
what are you waffling on about? You weren’t even calling out ‘hippies who think it will double tomorrow’ you were literally calling out someone that said it will crash even further lmao. Do you know what a bull trap is?
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:38:22


Correct. I then went on to lay out the reasons as to why I believed that. I didn't just repeat it expecting that to suffice.


No, I attacked his views. Big difference.


That doesn't address a single one of my points. We weren't talking about banks. We were talking about how it is expected that society can thrive without money to spend on it's basic needs. Again: Feel free to actually address the point at any time.

* Repeats same phrase over and over instead of addressing any single point
* Replies with something that's completely unrelated to what we were talking about
* "Your arguments illogical, therefore I don't have to bother arguing it!"
Congratulations there buddy, you've hit the "I don't actually have a point but I'm going to argue on the internet anyway" jackpot! I'll ask you again: Please address one of my points. You don't have to address them all if you find it difficult or intimidating. You only have to give me one _actual_ reason why you think I'm wrong instead of "lol ur illogical bro".
Just a single argument. Surely you can do that mate?
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:46:59
Is that sketch you’re using op?
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:33:18
I bought into a vanguard ETF last month for £500 and put the same amount of money in BTC. The Vanguard is sitting at £511 with the BTC at £770 now which is cool.
That being said, I'm not shitting myself over the vanguard crashing anytime soon and it'd be stupid to assume this'll be the case forever.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:47:56
Nice! I did a lot of design in college with photoshop and it was painful. My work bought me a copy of sketch recently and it blew me away. It’s really nice to work with
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:07:10
Nope, there wasn't in the slightest. About the only point you made was a weird detour into banking (despite the fact that I never made a point about banking).
You've yet to address a single one of my points now buddy despite me asking what... 4 times? If you're just going to come back with another 'lol ur illogical fam' then don't bother. Remember: You only have to answer one of my points if you feel like 2 is too much for you :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:40:54
Hmm yeah the more I'm reading the worse it gets
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:40:59
Why? Genuine question
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:20:43
What a well thought out and mature answer. You definitely convinced me buddy /s
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:40:21
To make it worse their social media accounts are silent. No apology. No reasoning. No "we're on it". Just silence pretending nothings happening.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:50:44
Just persevere as much as you can and you should eventually get it out 
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:24:12
This is terrible advice. What happens when they do ask for it? You can't just put your fingers in your ears and pretend you can't hear them. All that's going to happen is suddenly OP is going to owe $2.5k they otherwise wouldn't of. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:22:56
Word of advice: Don't take this as free money. They may well have fucked up. But eventually they will find out and eventually you will have to pay it back. This situation happened to my sister with a bank transaction. Saw a bunch of free money in her account and so spent it and then got into debt having to pay it back.
Just because they fucked up doesn't mean you get to keep it
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:52:32
You're spot on OP. The majority of people here are in it as a get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:16:16


But there's no guarantee that it'll continuously go up. People seem to be under the impression that any dip will result in the price just going higher a few weeks later so think naturally that must translate to long term gains. It's all well and good saying 'Just hold for 20 years!' but there is a very real possibility of bitcoin not being worth much in 20 years time.
If I invest in an ETF I'm pretty sure that there's going to be at least something there in the very long term. If there's not then there's probably bigger problems seeing as the worlds economy would've vanished. Where as bitcoin hasn't even made it past its first decade yet.
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:52:07


This is such a childish argument. Taxation is required for the basic needs of society to be met. Without which, you wouldn't have a system in which to earn the 'fruits of your labour' in the first place.
Without taxation how do you propose we pay for things like schools, police, firefighters, hospitals, roads and other public assets?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:32:24
So you'd recommend in investing in XXX mint stocks? Maybe polos? I feel small sweets are going to see returns of 2000% this year
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:58:29


... and they give you ownership of a company and the ability to cast votes. I’d also point out that your statement is true for 99.9999% of bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:07:36
So because someone is not libertarian they believe in absolute authority of government &amp; the military industrial complex? Give me a break
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:50:17
Yep bingo. It’s kind of scary seeing people get so cocky. Thinking that because they’ve already got 500% returns they definitely will in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:56:37
Ah how convenient. Can’t tell me why I’m wrong though
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:55:10
What is this? 10 minutes in and still haven't heard a single thing about bitcoin. Just some guy ranting about the military and how he hates democracy
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:56:15


I think that’s the perfect term honestly. It is stupid. I’m really happy to worked for him. I genuinely mean that. But betting all your savings on one horse is just so incredibly short sighted.
The thing that annoys me is that someone might read that and think ‘well he won so I’m going to as well!’  despite the fact it could very easily crash and they’ll loose everything. It’s not just him either really. I’m seeing it on this subreddit more and more.


Nope, it is analogous to betting. There’s so much that can go wrong. Yes the technology backing it is incredible but that’s not the only thing that’s going to count towards success.
There’s a multitude of events that can happen and tank bitcoin. This isn’t just me singling out bitcoin either. It’s any investment. For the most part trading stocks is rolling the dice unless done over the long term in something like index funds. Getting cocky and betting all on red might just work out for you. But it could also blow up in your face. 
For every guy that bet his life savings and become a millionaire, there’s a thousand that lost everything.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:38:18
Regardless of a tech it's _still a gamble_. There's still so much that could go wrong. I see people being cocky about long term results here all the time but it's just wrong. Invest what you can afford to loose and you will be okay in the event of a crash.
But investing more than you can because you're 'sure the technologies gonna catch on bro' is a way to quickly see most of your savings disappear. Things fail in finance all the time regardless of how good and revolutionary they are.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:49:28
I don’t really think that’s a good thing. It will make it pretty hard to use as a currency which is its intended purpose. I mean sure it’ll make everyone a fuck load of money but who will actually be using it to buy things?
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:27:40
That is such a stupid view to hold honestly. 'Anyone who doesn't think like me HATES FREEDOM AND LIBERTY AND LOVES THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX'
Don't you see how idiotic that sounds?
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:23:09
Yes I do, my bad
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:59:22
Ah yes of course the banking system is notorious for paying people to comment vaguely positive messages on reddit
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:33:35
Our currency (GBP) pretty much tanked overnight due to the result of a single vote :( So you're right
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:40:45
It’s all about lifestyle creep really. If you get a $10k raise most people would be tempted to start treating themselves to something like a really expensive car on finance or some designer clothes every month. Then compound that across 5-6 raises and suddenly you have someone on $100k that’s living like a king but with barely any savings and massive monthly outgoings.
Best advice you can take if you’re happy with your current situation and get a raise is to just put all that extra money in a savings / investment account and forget about it. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:38:47
Even with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:58:14
Number 2. Had an opportunity to buy at &lt;$0.50 and passed it up. Also almost pulled the trigger after it hit $100 and crashed. Decided I wasn't gonna be a chump for the third time
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:44:28
Did he say he would?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:20:51


Right. As I said: in this instance hes lucky it worked. But it was a gamble. A gamble which could’ve cost him his life savings. That’s why it’s stupid. Irregardless of whether or not it works it’s still incredibly dumb to place all your eggs in one basket.


It’s one of the oldest pieces of financial advice in the world. There is not an accountant or financial advisor out there that will tell you to put all your money on one highly speculative asset unless they are trying to rip you off. 


Putting your entire portfolio on one high risk asset is pretty fucking wrong however you look at it. I remember the suicide warnings that had to be stickied after the first crash  because dumbasses like this guy lost everything.


Except I’m in on bitcoin. But I’ve also got savings in various other assets. Spreading the risk. Literally the oldest trick in the book. 
At the end of the day he made a really stupid gamble. I could go to the casino tomorrow, place my entire life savings on black 20 on roulette and walk out with millions. It doesn’t make it any less of a dumb fucking idea if it works. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:24:10
Just pay what you owe OP.  It’s the right thing to do. They will eventually try and get that money back anyway and by the time it’s got to that point they will have added a fee on top
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:55:43
I mean I can’t see why you’d react like that. I made a perfectly reasonable argument. Bitcoin is a gamble. Just like stocks and various other assets. To suggest that it’s not stupid to put all your eggs in one basket is just flat out wrong. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:29:13
I find BTC-&gt;GBP to be expensive. I’ve just been using Kraken and withdrawing in EUR. You might pay a small fee from your bank (&lt;£1) but that’s the cheapest method I’ve found 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:12:36


Have you considered freezing your assets?
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:28:38
Yes that was. Was I meant to get something else? Is there some deep hidden layer I missed? Because otherwise it’s just a video completely unrelated to bitcoin. Not sure what the point in it being posted here
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:25:02
That’s quite hyperbolic. You can value all of those things without being libertarian 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:15:44
For sure. I get that. My only concern is there’s a hell of a lot of hype about how it works as a currency and there’s a lot of speculation as to where it’ll go in the future. I’m not 100% sure it’s going to rise as a result of that.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:18:05
Right. But a 21% increase in a single day is still pretty fucking volatile however you look at it
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:37:22
So because it’s gone up so far it can’t possibly go down? Is that what you’re saying?
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:38:00


There's a pretty big fucking difference between voting and enjoying government power / the military industrial complex. But by all means continue with the strawmen.


I didn't fail. 


I never claimed that one political ideology was the go to. I simply claimed that it's absurd to say if you're not libertarian you hate freedom and love the military industrial complex. Which is true.


I'm not really against taxation so I couldn't care less
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:34:16
Well for one those stocks are a lot less volatile than BTC so it's a bit of a moot comparison. But really if you had invested all your money in one of those then the same advice would apply.
Putting all your eggs in one basket and being cocky about future returns is a sure fire way to get your ass burned.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:48:09
That wasn’t really a wise decision imo. I mean yeah it obviously made you money and that’s cool but it could’ve easily have fucked you royally. If you’re not diversifying you’re doing it wrong 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:15:07
Except it is. I mean sure the underlying technology is different but it’s still just an asset people are buying with the expectation of a value increase.
The only people buying bitcoin for its intended purpose of being used as a currency are people ordering from the dark web. Literally everyone else is just buying it and treating it like a traditional asset. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:10:07


Because like I said: I'm not here for a political discussion and to air my views. I simply claimed that it's absurd to say if you're not libertarian you hate freedom and love the military industrial complex. Which again... is true. 


Yep that's what I said. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:47:26
It’s only like 2 mins long. Regardless he says just use GDAX and withdraw from your Coinbase USD wallet to GDAX and you’ll avoid the fees
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:50:57
It's not immediately obvious to casual users of the currency. No need to be a dick
