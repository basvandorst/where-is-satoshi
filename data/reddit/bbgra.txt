You do realize that BTC (and all other cryptos) are quite correlated with the stock market?
So if the next big crash happens, the crypto market will just crash with it....

Everytime Wall Street shows some hickup, you see the same in crypto.
On a bigger scale: If the economy goes down, people panic sell because they might loose their jobs, their mortgage increase, and so on, so they need cash. Hence they sell their stocks if they hold any. And if they hold crypto, they will sell them.

All money - yes also BTC - is completely useless if you don't use is. Sure, if you waited a little longer you would have more. But even now, if you wait a little longer, it will be worth even more. And then, juuuuust a little longer, it will be worth even more. And before you know what's happening, you are 90 years and about to die.
So for god's sake, stop being greedy, be happy that you own a house and enjoy life!

While it is true and I agree that a lot of people are here for the profits, I don't think this is an issue. BTC can still be adopted for purchases.
Take any fiat currency right now. It is used for purchases as well as for trading, i.e., making money.
Think further: Let's say there is only crypto. I am 100% sure, in the end, there will be more than one currency. As soon as you have this, you can start trading between the two of them, with the purpose to make money.

Looks fake.
Only difference on the pictures is that USD was replaced by XBT. In the background, it still says Visa, 10 XBT is a ridiculous amount, so yeah... 
But maybe I am wrong.
Can you provide a source?
