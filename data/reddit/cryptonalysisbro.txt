Very interesting take on bitcoin value relative to the others from an institutional investor. He essentially believes it’s very difficult to predict future value of utility tokens because gas prices may get close to marginal cost but bitcoin market cap could be trillions:

It does make a lot of sense in developing countries.  In the US, I think the argument needs to be that Bitcoin is a better store of value than the banking system due to increased security, faster transfers, etc., etc.  But in developing countries where you can't trust that the bank will hold your money and give it back to you when you need it, Bitcoin seems to be the perfect hedge.

This is exactly the intent of bitcoin. In areas where you can’t trust banks or the government to hold your money you can use bitcoin for control without any form of censorship. While there will always be some security risks, bitcoin prevents the situation where your bank goes under or disappears and your life savings go with it.

I don't think he's nervous because he's full of shit.  I think he's nervous because he's sitting in front of a panel of about 8 people who think crypto is a bunch of nonsense.  But he stood his ground and had a response for everything and his analogy to the cellular industry is very interesting.

This is really exciting.  Seems like this is a perfect use case for Bitcoin - a developing country where you can't trust the banks.

The bubble comparison makes more sense with ICOs where token creators raise large amounts of money for a system that hasn't been built where it's unclear whether they can deliver on their promises. With Bitcoin the system is fully functional and worth what people are willing to pay. If anything having people jump in because of the hype without knowing much about is a good thing due to the networking effects.

I think he was saying the exact opposite.  There are 10 extremely good days per year and no one knows when they are so if you try to time it up you will fail and lose out.

Bitcoin is a form of collectible.  There are some interesting articles about historical civilizations that would hold onto collectibles as precious family heirlooms and trade them several years later for much more than they got them for.

50k by December 2018?

Looks like things are coming back around.

That is correct which is why I put affordable in quotation marks.  But the problem is that psychologically people either don't know they can't buy a fractional amount or they seem to think if they can't afford even 1 unit then it isn't worth purchasing.  It's like the people who would prefer Apple stock over Amazon because they can buy 10 shares of Apple for every share of Amazon even though the market caps are about the same.

mBits are 0.001 BTC as in a milli BTC.  Satoshis could be a good way to go as well.
