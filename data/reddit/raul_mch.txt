Is there a list of which brokerages, if any, are offering Bitcoin futures?  I'm on TD Ameritrade and Merrill Edge and Vanguard.

How do you think a 980ti would compare? That what I have. I’m also on Windows 10. Would I have to go Linux?

Ate any brokerages offering the futures yet? Merrill Edge? TD Ameritrade?

Thanks for your post. What are you using to buy/sell btw? Does your platform allow you to place Limit orders?

Where are they buying Bitcoin by the way? Is the infrastructure of Coinbase, etc, robust enough to support all this increased volume?

I greatly admire this endeavor and hope it inspires other potential philanthropists!

Any opinion of Coinbase?

I’m fascinated by behavioral psychology and this a great post on the subject.

What altcoins do you think are worth mining?

So, why not just have it at Coinbase? They must be doing well enough to be pumping up their infrastructure and security.

More pain tonight tomorrow morning as Asian markets continue to sell. But, I think a bounce comes tomorrow afternoon. What will it be bouncing off of? My guess: $5500ish.

Funny, I almost sold last night at the exact same level, near where I bought it. But, I thought, "Let's see what the bounce is like after this general market sell-off is done."  
I do still think at a least a "dead cat bounce" is due after this sell-off settles. Likely tomorrow.

It seems to always be the case that when the general asset market corrects, the most speculative/volatile investments sell off the most. And Bitcoin, whatever its merits, is one of the most speculative investments out there. 
There will be a bounce. At least a "dead cat" bounce. Probably starting tomorrow or Wednesday if the general market settles a bit.
