Dude if they ban it then there's no real world application for it, it'll just go back to being that currency you buy drugs and Hitman on f*cking Silk Road. Prices would drop back down to under $3000 again. Don't get me wrong I want cryptocurrency to win, I hate the f*cking government but all these f*cking idiots on here are acting like they're crypto Pros and talk down on anybody that doesn't agree with their opinion.

Yeah, the very few do it that way and it's only 3rd world place that are.

How did you pay for your Bitcoin then? God you crypto hypes are dumb, do you really think that the government is going to let cryptocurrency take over the federal note? Who do you think really controls the internet? All they have to do is ban cryptocurrency, this sh*t will never pick up. The only way is companies like Amazon and Walmart started using cryptocurrency, and if they did it would be just one coin. Not the million different coins that exist.

People like you are one of the problems why Bitcoin will never work, instead of talking with each other and trying to fix the problem you just talk down on people. What's your opinion on what I said?

I think the reason why Bitcoins not doing so well is that there are so many damn coins, and there's no fixed price. Let's say I wanted to buy a car for $11,000 and I offer the dude one Bitcoin by the time we make the transaction bitcoin could be at 13000 or 9000. I just don't get it. Why so many coins.
