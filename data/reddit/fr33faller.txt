2020 trump declares financial collapse worldwide.  Emergency powers and 2nd term granted to him to usher in the future of crypto one world currency.
Within months we'll be awkwardly bumping into each other at the mall.

Can anyone share how to sell my bitcoin cash... I have it on a jaxx wallet and those fuckers won't update the software to help me shift it.
I can access my public keys and private keys but I can't bloody well find out where to shift it from there to an exchange to sell it?!  I tried bitrex but there's no way to import the private key in there :( So I'm stuck with Bitcoin crash  :(
Can someone help please? 
Other than that.. btc.. yayyy £2400 over here in UK :D
