It looks like they are are going to ban it soon, including ownership of bitcoin.
That's got me curious though how the legality of mining would work.
Like what if you make yourself a business in the UK that owns and controls the bitcoin address, and you mine it in Algeria. would that count as an illegal transaction if the Algerian mine never "owns" the bitcoin. who knows?
I guess if they're gonna go through with it, they'll outlaw mining as well.
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:41:30
If more people mine it, the difficulty will increase and it would cost the same to mine.
But mining doesn't really prop up the price anyway. Because if the price of bitcoin goes down, then the miners don't get paid as much so there will be less miners.

What country? Algeria?
I guess if the government was cracking down on it, they could easily monitor the data from electricity companies and see that your building isn't a business but is still using tonnes of power.

Why did satoshi invent it then?
@_date: 2018-10-28 20:16:22
I wonder what would happen hypothetically in say 100 years if the current private key cryptography gets broken. 
As technology improves, everyone can keep upgrading their private keys to make them longer/more secure whatever, but you can't upgrade the lost bitcoins, so they could eventually be reclaimed back into circulation? which could be &gt;15% of the supply?
@_date: 2018-10-20 16:57:16
Ah I see, does the electrum wallet use the SPV that satoshi talked about or a different one?
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:29:57
How much more would the network security increase if those numbers doubled?
@_date: 2018-10-20 00:38:40
Is it good enough to validate and see how many confirmations the payment you received has? what is SPV's purpose then?
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:02:06
Can they use SPV for that?

How easy is it to reverse transactions with RBF?
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:31:38
All those double spends are low fee txs that didn't propagate or ones that are broadcast at exactly the same time with less than 1 second delay. 
The successful ones are on [page 16](
So if person A makes an RBF tx to the merchant's address M, then person A uses the replace by fee and changes the tx to address D back to themselves for a double spend. Then because the merchant has the private keys to address M of the first tx, he can change the miner's fee to 100% in the double spend tx to counter it. Is that correct?
Can you link me to a source where that is actually implemented in the protocol, I can't find any.
@_date: 2018-06-30 21:11:01
So you're saying that right now if i sent my bitcoin to your address A as an RBF. Then I quickly use the RBF and resend the tx to my address B. You would be able to use the private keys from your address A to increase the fees to 100% of my second tx going to B? thus countering my double spend attempt, and making me lose my money to the miners?
I can't find any info of this on google.
Thanks for the discussion. BTW
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:27:10
If they ruin 0-Conf, then they devalue the coins they mine.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:43:44
It's safe to accept for small transactions, because most miners will reject double spends. It's in their interest to do so.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:37:45
0-conf for small transactions.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:25:34
You forgot ID verification at JP Morgan's Lightning Hub^^TM
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:16:16


Yup, what could possibly go wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:43:57
I see how RBF could work like that, but is that actually implemented, where the merchant can force 100% of the fee to the miner thus thwarting the double spend? or was that just an idea?
I see on  there has been 2 successful double spends by the same person in the last 4 months. so that could make a chargeback rate of 0.00014%

if you look back a few transactions, you'll see the consolidation cost $184.

Hey, at least I didn't talk about Dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:06:06
The coins are still yours until the transaction confirms.
it could eventually confirm, so don't lose the private keys to where your sending it to.
but i'm a bitcoin noob and don't know much.....I assume you sent the transaction from a wallet with coins in multiple addresses, so I guess you just have to find out which address the transaction is using, and send the coins from that address to a new one.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:01:51
So your'e gonna argue that Eth had 1,300,000% gains because it traded at $0.10 aswell?
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:14:13
I watched it live too, that price is because all the buy and sell orders were messed up and/or frozen. (I can't remember, maybe people were only able to place new buy orders but not sell orders). Then after a few minutes the trading was halted.
[It hit $4,100.](
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:45:32
So why did they halt the trading then?
If you can show me it reaching $9k on multiple exchanges then I'll believe you.

When on earth was BCH $9.5k?
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:52:04
I'm surprised banks haven't started doing fractional reserve banking with bitcoin and other cryptos yet to try and destroy them. 
It's only a matter of time, I'd give it 15 years to wait for cryptos to become stable. Then banks will first be legitimate investments where you deposit crypto and they lend it out. 
Then they will ever so slowly start the artificial inflation of the money supply. Only difference, no gov't bail out this time.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:11:29
Just make sure to move your BSV coins first to an address you control (otherwise they try and replay attack any BCH tx to make it look like there's more activity on the BSV chain, happened to me) and wait a few confirmations on the BSV chain. 
Then move your BCH coins to a different address that you control, once both are confirmed at different address, then you have successfully split them.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:24:04
I'm sorry for arguing, based on your comment history, we both like BCH anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:55:29


Agreed, so what was the purpose of your original comment that it traded at $9.5k then?
Eth also traded on coinbase at $0.10.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:05:12
Nice +1, anyone have link to that other one, with all the crypto olympic pole vaulting fails.

@_date: 2017-06-29 22:01:49
I bet they'd try, they would do it for free with no transaction fees and no restrictions, it would work just fine as long as everyone doesn't withdraw at once. But yeah hopefully not  that many people will participate in it.
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:29:30


Ok [by that logic,]( bitcoin fell from $40,000 then.
