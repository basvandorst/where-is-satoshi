The host reminds me of those old banking geezers in Mary Poppins.

You're assuming that he's going to keep Bitcoins and not convert them to USD. If he did keep them then yes, a floating rate would be profitable. But I think he's a little smarter than that.

Not good enough. The actual exchanges need to be as decentralized and anonymous as localbitcoins
@_date: 2013-07-05 21:25:04
WELL, YOU DO DESERVE A GREAT VALUE!

Any ideas on how they might try to take advantage of the volatility of BTC and drive the prices down before investing? 
These guys are pros. I seriously doubt they will just "buy in" before engineering some sort of drop.
@_date: 2013-02-17 23:36:46
Not really. If he thinks Bitcoins are undervalued, a rise in their price at a locked-in rate would mean he would lose a potential profit.
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:24:54
Doesn't all of this verification defeat the entire purpose of Bitcoin? It seems BTC users are accepting convenience over anonymity by continuing to trade with Gox, BitInstant, etc.

Funny, I commented about the bubble popping yesterday. Downvoted instantly.
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:28:29
What country?
@_date: 2013-06-29 15:36:54
Think they sell "Bit Coins". It's a currency used to fund terrorists and buy drugs.
@_date: 2013-06-30 21:08:07
Not sure WTF you're talking about...

A little new here... could someone explain?

Interesting take on whether or not we're in a bubble. Keep in mind that while we compare the severity and likelihood of bubbles to past events, we ignore the fact that these events didn't have precursors either. 
That's the point of uncertainty; if you could predict it simply off of previous events, it wouldn't be uncertainty.

...or try to sabotage it. Imagine what a DDOS from an actual country would do.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:00:38
Funny how posts like these only show up *during* a collapse.
@_date: 2013-05-16 03:13:33
Hopefully you get the point anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:58:46
Sit down.

Good to have an actual trader's perspective...
But you're saying there are derivative markets for virtually anything? 
Are they exclusive to the larger trading firms, or can anyone access them?
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:30:49
And that's what we're seeing in the markets today- no huge drop. If this had happened a month ago I'm sure there would be widespread panic. 
We're lucky the April crash weeded out quite a few ~~speculators~~ people who know nothing about markets and have a credit card.
@_date: 2013-02-18 02:29:41
How easy would these things be able to hack? I imagine it's why BOA or WF don't have NFC technology at their ATM's yet.
@_date: 2013-02-20 01:26:47
You're absolutely right. My bad.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:35:43
I'm sorry, you were saying...?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:02:02
You and countless others. I find it funny that on the one day where knowing this information is pointless, it gets upvoted to the front of the page. 
Ideally, this will make BTC stronger. We will have less speculators holding currency and the kids who think this is some sort of Chuck-E-Cheese game will throw in the towel.

Yeah, pretty sure OP just finished reading Atlas Shrugged or something.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:32:30
So did you plan for a DDOS attack like this, or was it something unexpected? What steps do you normally take to prevent this sort of thing?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:09:04
I've heard of some sites using cloud computing to insure against DDOS attacks. Their bill is a little more expensive at the end of the month, but they never crash. Why hasn't Mt. Gox gone this route?
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:32:26
Exactly. And maybe after the slight drop in BTC we can weed out the spectators and get more investors who want to actually use BTC for exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:08:17
Does working on BTC programs require extensive knowledge in the subject? I've been hard pressed to find freelance programmers with BTC expertise.
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:29:13
There doesn't need to be. Just an attack against the exchanges.
@_date: 2013-02-17 23:02:07
Interesting he will allow users to lock in with the current Bitcoin rate. I wonder if he thinks BC's are overvalued, since a drop in their price would be the only way he could profit off of a locked-in rate.
