Take my upvote.

This is what we call a "bruh moment".
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:59:29
Please break down your acid trip into smaller paragraphs. 
You're hurting my eyes.

We basically just need wallets that support the major (and up-and-coming) cryptocurrencies, and has a large focus on making the wallet smooth and the user experience as simple as possible. There's no need to add really shitty coins such as Litecoin Cash that no one cares about.

Bitcoin isn't a country!
@_date: 2018-05-08 06:40:35
Yeah, true enough. I check the price obsessively sometimes ��
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:29:17
Why is it called “Hodl” anyway? Is it a play on “hold”?
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:17:01
Haha! So true.
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:56:05
You just stole that off of r/showerthoughts !
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:22:42
Rather interesting, but I think some of the ratings are slightly wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:29:41
Hmm... Bitcoin ATMs in general. I’ve used loads. They are very good, very efficient but often have fees of like 10% or something stupid. Check it out on CoinATMRadar first.
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:57:07
Yeah! I mean, seriously people!
@_date: 2019-06-09 21:29:35
Yeah. You're right, giffgaff aren't great for data, but I'm on WiFi most of the time so it's fine.
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:32:42
You're on EE?
Go on giffgaff, it's much cheaper.

Next time I'm in Soho I'll go and ask the shopkeeper where they got the poster from. That might help find it. You're right, it probably isn't exclusive to that one shop...
@_date: 2019-06-09 21:42:47
Well then, I guess we're early adopters!
I reckon it'll catch on soon.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:30:08
Oh bitch please. Actual "dealers" have accepted bitcoin for far longer...
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:34:39
You didn't get the joke then...
Think "dealers" who accept bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-06-10 06:37:02
It's just the design. 
If Bitcoin is any ideology, it's libertarian, because it gives people freedom
I don't think the fist represents a Communist revolution, but rather just a revolution in general. 
And this time, it's a good revolution that'll hopefully happen very soon! ��
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:36:25
Don't worry about it.
On another note, I think it's really cool that your **car** dealership is accepting bitcoin. I don't know any other **car** dealers who do that.
@_date: 2019-06-09 14:04:23
Oh. Well, that's me proven wrong then! ��
@_date: 2019-06-08 23:03:32
I've never thought about that before. Yeah, you're right. Even though I'm sure future wallet apps and stuff will address this issue somewhat, even so, after the entirety of the 21 million coins have been mined, the circulating supply will actually start to decrease a bit, perhaps driving up the value of the coins very slightly.
@_date: 2019-06-09 01:26:21
I think it was Wardour Street.
@_date: 2019-06-09 00:41:32
And yes, I would've taken more pictures, but I was in a bit of a hurry, so that's the best one I've got.
@_date: 2019-06-09 21:31:24
I don't understand why this is becoming so damn political. 
It is just a poster telling people that they can buy bitcoin inside that shop.
I am not promoting Communism or anything like that.
Not even in the slightest. 
All I am doing is reporting on a poster that I have seen in a shop window. 
I haven't made it political. 
It's only political because you and others are making it political. But then again, this is Reddit. 
 **Chill out!**
@_date: 2019-06-09 01:30:47
Yeah, it's on the left as you walk down towards Shaftesbury Avenue.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:39:34
Really? It cost me about £1.15 to send £50, and that was using the low (and therefore slower) transaction fee!
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:49:33
Fair enough, but the news article says that France wants to become a leader in BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. Nowhere in that post is the word “bitcoin” mentioned.
I know that Blockchain comes from Bitcoin originally, but I’m still not convinced that France is the pro-cryptocurrency utopia that the new article makes out it is.

Now that MtGox has gone bankrupt, what will you do with your life now? Do you see yourself returning to the field of cryptocurrency in the future?
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:08:00
Bitcoin is vulnerable to a 51% attack (if one person or organisation somehow manages to own 51% of all BTC). If 51% of all Bitcoin was released into the system at once, it would break.
I think. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Finally, something for the MacBook Pro touch base that's actually useful!
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:36:44
If everyone did this and circulated the notes, then it would be the ultimate protest...
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:14:01
You can't buy one now with ease, at least in the UK, because of FUCKING BREXIT.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:46:59
Just to be clear, Gold has an undefined finite supply (because you can only mine so much Gold, but we don't know how much we can mine at the moment), and Bitcoin has a defined limited supply, because we know that we can only ever mine 21,000,000 coins before the supply runs out.
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:24:03
Thanks for correcting me. This could happen, actually. Three major mining pools control slightly more than half of the network’s hash power, so an attack could be coordinated.

I don't know. You could ask u/MagicalTux, the ex-ceo of MtGox.

How long will it take this post to reach 50 Million readers?

Although you could visit the Lamassu website, their machines cost around $7000 plus shipping - and cut out the middle man (the middle men are companies like SatoshiPoint and BCB ATM)
