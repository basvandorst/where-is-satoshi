That was the transaction fee
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:58:00
$150 worth of kfc... aahhmmmm
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:18:27
That will be $5 + $30 tx fee.

@_date: 2017-08-18 21:26:15
It's reported to have vulns. Why not ledger?
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:30:54
Fair enough.
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:10:30
"gold is scarce" sure, but it's not why it's valuable. The only reason why gold worth anything to anyone is because we, the society, decided it's valuable... because it's yellow and shinny.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:12:31
And the to confirm a tx seems to be double
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:17:01
We've been over this. He will do it anyway
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:20:38
So my wallets will only work with the old tx type?
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:22:06
Never understood how hardware wallet works, does it have the entire blockchain???
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:06:59
Tried CoinBase, for $4 worth transfer, had to pay additional "network fee" of $2 worth.

Smart move... Didn't work so well for BTC-e wallets. But hey, they might refund the confiscated funds: 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:23:14
It really bugs me to hear this from him
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:10:10
Why not ether?
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:30:07
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:16:30
I see your point. What are your thoughts on zcash?
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:13:05
Diamonds are a special case. It's not a scarce resource. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:21:53
First time I'm hearing about it. Please tell me more.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:13:30
You mean the cat shit coffee?
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:28:18
I need new friends so I could hear about stuff like that 10 years ago!
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:31:34
I don't think it works this way.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:13:18
Donate them 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:35:28
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:19:45
How does it even work?
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:06:07
But OP should read about recommended fee, otherwise it will take forever!
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:37:00
Except one thing. If the power goes down bitcoin dies. Sadly gold survives.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:16:25
Yeah, but mcafee is a loon
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:19:36
Who's going to buy when they cause a deep dip for a few hours? ;)
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:55:04
Your friend sounds like a piece of work
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:25:38
I honestly don't understand ripple. You can send money with all the currencies. Also, the creators hold like 90%.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:18:54
You're welcome man ;)
(it's a joke, but the address is real :) )
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:24:26
As long as people believe in stability, the debt means nothing. Every time I see an analyst saying the bubble is around the corner, that asshole should kill himself for attempting to cause panic!
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:57:00
1. Gov promises everything will be ok
2. You can hold it, or some of it
3. It's been around for a long time
4. Everyone use it
5. All businesses accept it
6. It's "more stable", crypto goes up and down like stock 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:13:10
Your problem starts when you open cnn
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:37:09
It matters to me, I want them :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:43:38
Thanks for the info 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:48:45
I think it's better to mine zcash, easier. But of course you need the right rig.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:09:26
what law?
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:43:35
But in order to send btc I need to have an uptodate blockchain, no?
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:15:20
Are you "mining" with it as well?
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:57:17
You can't kill the ~~metal~~ Bitcoin
The ~~metal~~ Bitcoin will live on
~~Punk-Rock~~ Bitcoin Cash tried to kill the ~~metal~~ Bitcoin
But they failed, as they were stricken down to the ground
~~Grunge~~ Other shitcoins tried to kill the ~~metal~~ Bitcoin Ha,hahahahaha
They failed, as they were thrown to the ground
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:11:29
It's volatile. I love it!
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:53:13


So the fee changes during the day according to the number of active transactions at a given moment?
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:35:36
Was it so old that people would tip in whole coins?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:31:24
Gone forever?
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:20:03
I'm saying that one day it won't matter because it will be the main currency and we will no longer need fiat to measure it's value.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:49:26
From my personal experience, you should always search: &lt;exchance/service&gt; review reddit
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:40:29
Thanks for clearing this out 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:40:46
Even on simple hardware?
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:21:25
Then you're not chocking it on regular basis. IMO you don't need to do anything.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:07:00
You know the Hollywood propaganda says "diamonds are forever"? It's true, they are forever with you, because no one will buy it from you for a reasonable price.
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:16:29
I'm new, what hard fork?
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:21:32
*cough* coinbase *cough*
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:03:28
What do you mean more secure?
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:49:46
Solar flair then ;)
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:50:33
What wallet provider?
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:33:16
Is there anything that can cause this price to drop dramatically?
Someone finds 100K BTC under the floor and sells them all at once...? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:55:48
Unless you hodl until it becomes THE currency, the value to fiat will eventually go down... no?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:43:39
Sorry about your friend
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:53:08
Don't know, sorry
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:31:28
And litecoin will be around because.. why?
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:17:45
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:28:24
And when it comes, will you hodl?
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:45:30
Coinbase is considered pretty safe, it's one of the largest and more trustworthy exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:41:09
I wonder how much he paid for them?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:09:30
Did it come with a bundle of dildos? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:39:14
What about ether? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:49:42
Install a wallet on your machine and then you will only pay for the network transaction. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:37:20
Will they remain compatible, or at some point I'll have to make new paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:21:12
TL;DR please
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:29:26
It's one thing to receive, it a whole different ball game to transmit and for the satellite to receive your transmission.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:01:32
I guess.. I was really hoping for that damn dip :(
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:45:19
When you put it that way
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:42:38
No one will remember. It's just like with EA and pre orders.

2.5% is nothing. After xmas they charge extra because it now a "trendy" game

It's a trap! No way they just called it off.
They will role it and surprise us all in the ass!

China banned btc.
Chinacoin is coming soon /s
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:47:01
They mean it's now illegal for the people. But imperialistic china republic will keep all to itself... or make a chinacoin
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:09:40
You will probably have to be chinese

I think there is something in dev, check upcoming icos.
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:36:01
You might be right.
A couple of question regarding hardware wallets:
1. What happens if you lose the hard wallet, how do you access your funds? 
2. If it's stolen, can the thief access it?
3. Does it require the computer to have an up-to-date blockchain (if at all) to send?

@_date: 2017-10-10 02:37:44
No! It's the other way around.
If your funds are on coinbase, move it to a wallet in your full control.
