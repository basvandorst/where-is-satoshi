A: but I only purchased fee simple title. The allodial title was not for sale. What you just said was no different than a renter saying he owns the house because he paid rent and lives there. 
B: you just said allodial title us BS. Now you say I have it?


X, Y, and Z are probable based on circular argument. That or refuted by Rothbard and the Tennahills. 


So why would I want it? So you don't believe in sovereign ownership of land? Strange. 


Totally. Legal ownership is objective. Rightful is subjective.

Land that individuals as a group claim to own. 
A country is as real as a homestead.

Progress. I can dispute your home ownership. It's now invalid?


The objectivity of law has nothing to do with validity. If you sell pot in Texas it is an objective fact that you have violated the law. Validity of that law is subjective and has nothing to do with the objectivity of breaking it. 


The position of the ball is objective. 
Now let me try one. You come home to find me in your house and you say "get out, this is my house". Does the truthfulness of that statement have to do with whether or not I'm playing your game?


No. They don't have to play. But this field is for soccer, so that's the game being played here. 


Only if you presuppose that popular sovereignty is invalid. If you base that assumption on the argument above, you are using circular arguments. 


Everything is debatable. Being debatable does not make something untrue.

I was just pointing out that a country is more than people. It is share property and a social contract. That contract can have stated goals. Goals that are tied to the people and the land.

I am sure you are good at that. What you quoted was from me was an observation I made of anarchists in general. I don't need to provide proof because it just an observation. Then again. Maybe you are trying to say that I am wrong about the "most certainly do not" part, in which case your comment would be fucking hilarious. 
Fee simple and allodial title are not things I am asserting. These are recorded facts. I deal only in reality, not anarchist fantasy.

Private companies can compete all they want. They don't because it don't work. Roads are based on easements held by the public. You can't block people from using their easement.

No. I'm using chain of title. That is not law, that is ownership. 


I'm sorry. You are wrong. I own fee simple title to my house. That is a fact. It is also true. Same as the national ownership of allodial title. 


I believe in self ownership. I'm pretty much ok with the NAP though I don't think it can exist without enforcement and a social contract. 


Rightfully? No. But that would be ownership. 


One good assertion deserves another. I know enough about AnCaps to have pretty good idea of what you advocate for. There really is no need to get into that though.

No. [here]( you need to read up on the subject a bit because your assumptions are getting in the way of real discussion. click [here]]( also.


Are you saying that my claim that the allodial title to all the lands of the United States is owned by the people of the United States is an unsubstantiated claim? If so, I would argue that the fact of ownership of the land by the people is self evident. It is in their possession, they retain exclusive right to enforce laws upon it and do so every second of every day without fail.


Indeed that is an assertion. I can assert that you DO NOT retain title to my car. And how may I go about proving this? If I present my own title to the car I am not actually proving my assertion correct, because it is possible that we might both retain the same title to the car if for instance a mistake was made somewhere down the line. So the only way to prove me wrong is for you to present the title yourself. I will eat my shoe if you present me a title search that shows you or any other AnCap as the holder of Allodial Title to any land within the United States. 


Your alternatives are not better. In fact, they are far worse.

You have been brigaded by You have the correct stance though. The anarchists want to pretend the have allodial title to land when they most certainly do not.
