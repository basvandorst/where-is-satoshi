But how can they use the service for illegal purposes?
@_date: 2015-08-08 03:31:38
To be truly I don't know if it can be used for vitrification, but definitely you can use these cards to pay via PayPal.

As a new service, we expected such concerns.
In order to prove that your service isn't scam, we can choose, say, 3 reddit users with a great karma and send them bitcoins, so they can make a test purchase from our service, check them and post feedback.
If anybody wish to participate, let me know. Thanks.

Does BLUR work with Bitcoin? Can it be used by people outside US and Western Europe countries?
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:27:23
I agree. Such service isn't for daily purchases. But if you want to purchase a member access to, say, an adult site and want to stay anonymous or be sure that your card will not be charged again. This service can be used for such things.

Don't agree with you.
What would you say about this site?
People sell thousands of such cards for years and it's absolutely legal.
Moreover, we are not US based company. Your financial system is over regulated.

Thank you for the feedback! Did you mean advcash.com?
I think we can lower prices. Current are just starter prices, we don't know yet what prices will be good for such service.

Can you tell me where I can find cheaper?

If you sell prepaid iTunes card to a friend, do you think you harm Apple?
This is special Visa product: prepaid gift cards which are designed to give away. Also these cards may be used with any name and any billing address and it's special Visa rules for this product.

Yes, your karma is pretty enough. Please send me your Bitcoin address, I will transfer you $15 in BTC.
@_date: 2015-08-09 05:18:03
Bitcoins I transfer were withdrawn after several minutes after deposit. No any reply for the next 24 hours. So I have to conclude that b_coin is a scammer.

Thank you for your interest! Unfortunately we have a first unsuccessful experience with b_coin which took the money and disappeared. 
So I decided, at Monday I will choose two willing with the best karma and allow them to test our service again. I'm sure we will find a decent people.

Sorry for my harshness, but in US you forgot about free trade. First you think: is it allowed or not by US regulators (I would say monopolists). Do you have your own head?
Please tell me how such service can be used in illegal cases? It's not designed for big money, we sell only cards with small amounts for small online purchases.
By the way, please don't forgot that not all people in the world have Visa cards.
@_date: 2015-08-07 21:27:11
Please don't compare it with the services which work outside of the Bitcoin world.

Just replied. To be correct, it's not an issue with the card. The buyer by mistake purchased the card with a smaller amount then he needed. The problem will be fixed. Waiting for your reply.

Couple of months ago I needed such service myself. I googled for it, but found only a couple of wired sites which required to register and fill a huge form with lots of personal details before they allow me to see what they offer.
So I decided to create such service. I'm sure it will be useful for someone :)
At least such service must exist as a bridge between the Bitcoin world and sites which don't accept Bitcoin yet.
