People who care about the technology care. Also people that have money invested and would like to earn profits from them, care as well. If we all wanted to just lose money we could easily send it to the IRS.

I use my Shift card linked to ETH on coinbase. Only time it failed me was when I hadn't used it in 6 months. Took a day to reactivate.  
EDIT: Reading the replys, just want to clarify(to the best of my knowledge). Shift is not a coinbase asset, it is a seperate entity that has teamed up with cb to link the card to your cb account. They have also teamed up with Dwolla to offer the same services.

If it weren't for your karma I would bet my BTC that this was an advertisement.
Definitely so considering no context, just a link to the device.

Dudes in Cali.. A lambo is a gas hog that was put together with cancerous materials. Surprised it's not a gold Prius, honestly.

If you happen to like your credit union and want to hang on to the account in hopes they will lighten up and realise crypto is the future; Do what I do.
I swipe my Shift card (linked to coinbase &gt;.&gt;) to my Square account that deposits to my CU debit account. The CU never sees coinbase or crypto at all.

It's like everyone just learned of the term Historic. What is historic about a bill just passed?

I don't mean to hijack this thread, but can someone point me to a sub where I can learn to turn an rpi into a node without buying thousands of dollars worth of crypto?

It's amazing how advertisements look like stories now a days.

Sounds like an Ad for bitmex. They aren't hard to spot anymore.

This is no where near fair. The first widely known airplane flown was in 1903. There was roughly 1.6 billion people at that time. Pokemon Go was released in 2016. There was roughly 7.466 billion people at that time.
For any of this information to be relevant it should be compared to a percentage of total population, not a set number of users.
