If you're a whale and want to dump a big position:
Step 1: Pump the market by small buys on light volume and drive the price up.
Step 2: When the suckers see the run up and think that they can get rich quickly, then dump as quickly as you can before the market falls too much.
Step 3: Repeat.
Of course, this only works so long as there are enough suckers who will buy as the price is increasing.

Agreed, but that may occur with the so-called fiat currencies instead, the salient point being whether BTC will be that medium or instead governments will themselves simply get rid of paper and coin currencies and run their own currencies on Blockchain or whatever alternative technology arises.
Heck, even today if JP Morgan sells $1 billion in CDS's to Goldman Sachs, they don't wheel $1 billion in cash across Wall Street between offices, but merely transfer the value electronically. I would wager that ever day the bulk of electronic transactions (electronic transfers and credit cards) already very substantially exceeds the amount of physical cash that changes hands.

So many folks in the financial world go on vacation in August that trading volumes get light and thus are skewed more than they normally would be by the day traders and pump-n-dumpers. This is why any run-up on light volumes in the summer is always very suspicious and almost always a good opportunity to short.
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:27:43
Probably not, since one can short an ETF as easily as go long in it. If anything, an ETF will mean even more volatility if that can even be imagined. My calculations still say "short at 7300 and north of that", and if it ever claws back to 7300 that's what I'm doing.
Biggest worry now is that it isn't going to claw back to 7300 anytime soon, so I'm off chasing different duds in the meantime.

The SEC does not, repeat not, look at the investment fundamentals of any new offering including an ETF. Instead, the SEC generally only looks at (1) whether adequate disclosures of risks have been made, and (2) if safeguards are in place so that investors' monies are not immediately embezzled or overly misused. So, as long as the are adequate disclosures about the issue, it shouldn't be one.

Actually, I think there will be at least run at 7000 before going solidly into 5000 territory -- that's just been the nature of the recent cycles. Remember a couple of weeks ago when it shot to around 8300 before sinking to where it is now? And before that, etc., etc.

Only if there is an expectation of a price rebound in the near term. Look at the oil industry -- if the price per barrel dips below $50 for a day, no biggie. But if it stays under $50 for a while, there are huge layoffs in the oil patch and the rigs stay in the equipment yards. So, there is probably some number at which the mass servers get switched off, although I would guess that the number is somewhere south of $5,000.

Actually, that technically is shorting, i.e., you borrow an asset for purposes of immediately selling it, and the later buy the SAME QUANTITY of the asset back at a hopefully lower price to realize a profit. That, of course, is different from selling an asset now in the expectation that you can buy MORE of it later at a lower price, and thus have more of the asset and greater profits if it rebounds.

@_date: 2018-06-27 22:45:45
Hope not -- too low to short safely, and want to see it give it the old college try back to 7,000 however briefly as that would give enough cushion to short again.

@_date: 2018-06-27 22:55:38
Since about February, the price has been waddling back and forth in a fairly tight channel but which takes it down 1000 points or so every couple of months. Since there is utterly no reason for that trend to break, at least in the near future, it means that you're looking at 5000s by August, 4000s by October, 3000s by December, etc. Then, at some point under 3000 the price will likely bottom and then go nowhere fast until there is some material change (what that might be is anybody's guess). It's also possible that at some point folks could start to equate BTC with Iraqi dinars, etc., in which case the bottom could fall out entirely.

Nah, true believers just move on to the next thing to true believe in. I'd wager that quite a few of the folks here also own Iraqi dinars which once upon a time were going to make them fabulously wealthy once the Iraqi government revalued (RV'd) them.

Needs to claw somewhere back in that neighborhood at least once to make it good for shorting again. Still too low to risk shorting much now so soon after a drop.

@_date: 2018-06-30 15:24:21
Uh, that was before the crash and it got a bad name, which is why it has continued to generally decline. Assets after a bubble bursts usually become nearly worthless over time, which is why they are so safe to short.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:58:47
Doubtful -- I actually think it will make a run towards 7000 before settling back into the mid-5000s for a couple of months (some of this will be pump-and-dump for folks trying to get out, but still the result will be the same).
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:16:46
Wiped out a lot of longs, but haven't watched the shorts lose money -- sometimes they may have ended up paying some interest carry a few days or weeks longer than they wanted to, but that's just a small blip against their profits. For the shorts to start losing, the entire direction of the market would have to go up and stay up for a considerable time to where they would have to close out their positions with losses.

Well, when you consider that for 2018 the drop was about 13000 then that 5700 doesn't look so hot, i.e., at 6500 the price of BTC is about half of just the drop. But don't fret, still some good mileage downhill yet to go!
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:41:52

At some point, probably between 2000 and 3000 the so-called "death spiral" will kick in where investors will grab any chair and get out rather than be left standing when the music stops completely. In other words, it will go from four-digits to under $1 very quickly -- likely within a couple of weeks of the spiral starting.

One of the oldest sayings on Wall Street: "A long-term investment is a short-term investment gone wrong."
   
BTW, Roger Ver and Faketoshi don't explain the previous drops, i.e., from 12000 to 10000, 10000 to 8500, 8500 to 7500, or 7500 to 6400. The more likely explanation for this drop is that a lot of investors who bought in late 2018 and early 2017 hoped for another run-up in late 2018 to make up their losses, and when that didn't happen they finally capitulated and sold -- probably not just a few to lock in losses for tax reasons to set-off against other investment gains.

Well, it would be contempt of court. They would throw you in jail until you complied, which could be for years quite literally. If you still didn't comply, then they could hit you with criminal contempt and then it would be for more years in jail, whether you complied or not.

Still think it is that folks who bought in high thought that there would be another year-end run-up in late 2018 like there was in 2017. When that didn't happen, capitulation by those investors began and triggered downward selling by others. Where it stops, who knows, but if it goes under 3000 then there will be widespread capitulation and possibly even the start of a death cycle.

Yeah, if there is going to be a bull run, most likely it will be before January 1 for tax reasons -- since buying before January 1, 2018 would also allow selling before January 1, 2019, and give investors the option of holding a full year and then liquidating after the one-year capital gains holding period, as opposed to buying after the first of the year and then be stuck holding into tax year 2020 or paying a higher tax rate within the one year.

You don't need technical support or a network. Just brand it as b2 and hold a huge event for only "crypto elites", but not anybody with a technical background -- old folks with fat IRAs are best. Tell them that next year's market cap will be 432.8 billion, and each unit will be worth at least 5600 but they can buy today at 10 so long as they buy a minimum of 10,000 units ($100,000 total per investor).
Get 200 people to sign up and collect their money. For a few months send out some technical-sounding reports telling how great b2 is doing. Then, put out a report that events in China plus a conspiracy of the banks and the Fed have really hurt b2, but you still have faith and will buy back units at 1 each.
Keep putting out reports for another couple of years until the Statute of Limitations for fraud expires, and then say with deep regrets the banks and the Fed won, so you're having to close up shop, but b2 units can be redeemed at par in Zimbabwean dollars.
Easy peasy!

Not so sure; most likely will continue to "step down" every couple of months as it did the earlier part of this year (and which this latest drop is simply in line with). Panic aside, my guess is that there will be short-term support in a 4800-5300 channel until the next change.
Maybe even another pump towards 6000 before the next major dump.

Same post-bubble slow decline as the rest of 2018 . . . although "death spiral" is starting to look more appropriate, just not sure we're there yet.

@_date: 2018-11-15 15:50:20
Very probably because there were folks who bought high last year and held on in the hopes that there would be another year-end run-up in 2018 too.
   
Then, when that didn't happen, the price went ker-plunk as they finally started unloading so as to "harvest" their losses for tax purposes, i.e., set off their 2018 losses in BTC against gains in other investments.
   
Maybe be volatile with a downward trend through the end of the year, but probably wouldn't bet on it either way since this last movement was irrational in volume and so there are unexplained (to me at least) market forces at play.

That was just the pump, such as it was. The dump hasn't started yet.
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:16:26
What was weird about the last drop is that, unlike most of the others, the drop wasn't preceded by a pump. When it was locked into that 6200-6500 channel for a few months, I really thought that there would be one juicy run towards 7500 before the bottom dropped out again and then it would level off in the 5800 neighborhood. That would have been consistent with the trading pattern.
The last drop was weird in the sense that the price was stuck in the same channel for so long, and then the bottom dropped out without a pump. My \*guess\* is that there had been price manipulation to sustain the 6200-6500 channel, and then when that sustaining price support went away it was like releasing the trapdoor and the bottom simply fell out to current levels. Since that price support went away around the same time as the Ver/Faketoshi fork drama, I have my suspicions as to who had been behind it.
Probably five years from now there will be some interesting books that talk about price manipulation in crypto, and Bitcoin in particular.

Yes, but the question is how high before it sinks into the mid-5000 channel. I thought that the last run would make it to 7000 or at least 6800 before it fell short, so it is at least a slight weaker market than it even appears. Still wouldn't surprise me there was at least one more run towards 7000 before sinking.

Yeah, I've been watching it creep towards 6800 -- and hopefully more like 7000 -- before shorting it again. If it stays below 6800 that likely means that the price is just going to meander for a while, slightly downwards but not enough to make it really profitable.

Au contraire, the shorts (like me) were waiting on the sidelines while BTC was low since the whole idea behind shorting is to sell at a high price and then cover at a low price. So most of us have been waiting for a pump to put in short positions -- look back through my recent threads and you can see that I've predicted that BTC would make at least one good run at 7000 before falling back into the mid-5000s, and this look like that run. So I (and I would bet the rest of the shorts) are pretty happy today.

Oh, golly, this is Investing 101 stuff. The answer to your question is that, with any short, the security is borrowed from some existing investor and then sold, and later the security is repurchased at hopefully a lower price and the position closed. Google "shorting stock".
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:46:09
We'll see, but really looks like the rest of the year since February, i.e., every two months a new trading channel about 1500 wide and each new channel 1000 lower than the previous one.
IMHO, price now has to break at least 7500 and more like 8000 to show a true change from this pattern.

Not necessarily, and that is why BTC is such a safe play for shorting -- once any investment has built a bubble and then burst, the chances of it coming back are basically slim and none since potential new investors will see how many people got burned before and will simply choose to invest elsewhere.

Nonsense. The ONLY way that a buyer can buy is if a seller sells, it is the SELLER's fault, not the buyer's. It is very fundamental: Buyers want to buy at the lowest price possible, and sellers want to sell at the highest price possible. The price goes up because there are more buyers than sellers, and the price goes down because there are more sellers than buyers. You did't have to go to Wharton to understand this.
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:07:37
Worse, since about March it has been one long "downward stairs", i.e., drop, stabilize for a while, drop again, stabilize for a while, drop again, etc. What serious investor would go long in that? The only way it to stop the downward stairs is if \*something fundamental\* occurs to change the value of BTC. What that might be, who knows, but whatever it is will have to be pretty dramatic and convince investors that BTC will be going up and not just continuing its downwards stairs march.

Uh, yeah, but that was before a gazillion people lost literally billions of dollars. The number of financial-product type securities that have fallen so much and then bounced back are few and far between, and even then it was usually at least a decade or more before they clawed back to their previous high.
@_date: 2018-07-14 15:57:38
Okay, there is reasonableness in that statement. But you also have to consider that the converse is equally true, i.e., those people who spread only good news to artificially pump the price so that they can later dump at a higher price, and which often ends up distorting the price downwards in a way worse then if they had done nothing at all.
That's why BTC and all crypto have a bad reputation among investors right now, which is that December 2017 was simply a massive pump-and-dump. Of course, nobody complained about all that fake good news when they thought they were getting rich, i.e., greed took over. In retrospect, BTC would have been better off had the December 2017 bubble never developed and it had continued its slow and steady growth. Now, there is a very real possibility that BTC is mortally wounded because the biggest investors who really drive investments markets will forever stay away.

@_date: 2018-07-05 17:22:39
Agreed, BTC has to get back to 7000 just to stop the bleeding. IMHO, for an indication of anything like a real bull market it needs to break 8500. Else, it is going to waddle back and forth in the 5800-6800 channel for a while before the next price slide.

Exactly. There are a lot of companies that are moving certain operations to Blockchain for reasons and purposes that have utterly nothing to do with BTC, and hodlrs of BTC don't make a tenth of a penny in technology royalties from businesses using Blockchain. The most likely result is that the transaction costs of dealing with government currencies will decrease in areas such as wire-transfers, currency conversions, and credit card transactions, which will further obviate the need for BTC. Then, of course, there are BTC's numerous other problems such as susceptibility to market manipulation, high volatility, and the linger reputation of an "investment" that costs many thousands of people many billions of dollars (or their local currency) worldwide. Bitcoin may survive at some level for dark activities, but BTC's chances of replacing any significant governmental currency is probably much less than 1 in 10,000.

It could be banned in any of several degrees of the severity, the worst being an outright ban on mere possession like child pornography.
Most likely, a ban would be of transactions.
At the lightest level, a government could effect a de facto ban by merely imposing a per-transaction tax, since then probably no merchants would use it due to the additional costs of reporting and remitting the tax. That is a win-win for the government, since if crypto continues to be used they make additional revenue, but if not then they have effected their ban without actually having to ban it.

FWIW, the wealthiest investors will usually go on extension and will not pay their taxes until their last extension runs out, i.e., September 15 for business entities, and October 15 for individuals. There are many reasons for this: (1) Their returns are usually much more complicated and can't be worked out quickly; (2) They usually invest in LLCs and limited partnerships, which often have their own complex returns, and thus don't crank out their Form K-1s until late August or September, (3) They like to hold on to their unpaid tax moneys for liquidity, and (4) There is a theory that goes around to the effect that the IRS in any given tax year only has the manpower to audit so many returns (which is true) and thus (this is the theory part) by the time the IRS gets to the returns late in the year their allotment of audits for that tax year have already been used up or substantially diminished, lowering the audit rate further if not eliminating it outright. BTW, this is one of the reasons that U.S. investments markets get weak in September and October (when most of the largest drops historically occur) because entities and wealthy investors are having to liquidate some positions to generate the cash to pay any tax liability they didn't estimate and pre-pay. The upshot is that the April 15 (or 17) tax day is mostly for wage-earners who are not big investors, if at all.

"Pump" is the first part of "Pump and Dump". Pump up the price with small positions, short the whatever with large positions, and then dump the small positions and try to create downward momentum and panic selling. It's an old, old game, which persists because it is usually pretty successful. BTW, in a regulated market it is illegal (at least in theory) as "market manipulation", which of course it is.

Still waddling in the channel between the 8905 high on 3/23 and the 6603 low on 4/6, though obviously more towards the high than the low. The 90-day moving average is still higher, at 9103. Even if it just keeps moving sideways a little while longer then it will get out of the downward trend, but it still needs to break out of the last high of 8905 to be considered anything like a true bull market, even a short-term one. A key to watch for here is whether volumes pick up -- the latest rise has been on relatively light volumes.

Steady floor around 6500 but the ceilings keep decreasing with every cycle, thus leading to sideways movement on decreasing volume -- classic technical analysis signs of "general loss of interest". What that means is a lot less than it sounds, however, because "interest" can turn in a second; however, a continued long-period loss of interest will inevitably lead to an eroding floor price as traders look for something with higher volatility, i.e., "something where something is happening".

Also, note that ETF will be nothing like a cure-all but will most likely just increase volatility since an ETF can be shorted too, i.e., an ETF is probably not going to change the number of investors who believe in BTC or don't believe in BTC, and thus will not move the price so much as simply give them a new financial toy to play around with, i.e., about how futures increased volatility but ultimately didn't increase the price.

The biggest is taxes -- buyers in December can hold for a year and still liquidate before the end of the next year if they want to, thus paying a lower capital gains tax rate.

Didn't you ride it down from 19000 to where it is now?

Yep, market has already taken that into account. Old news is no news.

So much for mooning in November. For a variety of reasons, if Bitcoin doesn't make a big comeback in December, it will very likely continue to decline through 2019.

The paid shills are the Sunshine Pumpers trying to get more suckers to buy and thus drive the price up

99% for fraud, which is a good thing.

Just like Mastercard and Visa, eh?

Doesn't that overlook the possibility that now a substantial amount of the news is negative, and some very negative?
Oh, and "most important post", seriously?

The root problem is that Bitcoin is subject to manipulation, and there is no mechanism to prevent manipulation. The manipulation has lead to high volatility and loss of trust.

Just as good as Mastercard and Visa!
