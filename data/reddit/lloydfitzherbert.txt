Thank you. Can you elaborate more on your use cases? Like what goods, under what setting, and with which third-party services provider in the Bitcoin ecosystem? I might try spending bitcoins very soon.

If bitcoin becomes a mainstream currency and transactions are done in bitcoin with no regards to fiat, then the world economy would be deflationary, and that would be economically disastrous for the whole world. 
But that is not my question per se, I am asking how can we ever get there if bitcoin is deflationary in nature--there just won't be enough commerce transactions to take us there because most people are just hodling (myself included).

Your post has been very helpful and I will try to spend more bitcoins as you do :)

Thank you. I hope that day come sooner than later.

Thank you. I see your point on how Bitcoin is not truly deflationary because its circulating supply will increase until 2140. But most people in bitcoins see that the fixed money supply halves every 4 year or so, and in reaction to that will behave as if bitcoin per se is deflationary. 
I do concede that people are more deterred from spending by price volatility (mostly upward) than by bitcoin's halving fixed money supply.
As for the rest, I agree with you.

Let's be honest, only a tiny fraction of bitoin's transaction volumes are true commerce transactions, and the majority of them are speculative. While LH or larger block sizes and many other new features to come can make bitcoin easier and cheaper to use, the deflationary nature of bitcoin is bound to punish those who spend, and reward those who save. How can bitcoin ever become a viable currency, instead just a store of value? Personally, I am not inclined to spend bitcoins, not because of the extra steps I have to go through, but for the anticipation that my bitcoins could earn me handsome returns in the years to come.
I have rarely seen this question discussed here, but I think it is a fairly important one.
