This is a really big deal.  True professional tools will be available for crypto trading.  Hopefully opens up data as well so other platforms can jump on board.

Medved is $20 subscription monthly.  Trading Technologies has options that are $400 monthly.  For a long time professionals refused to trade with anything that wasn't TT.  
Not even in the same league.

I agree with you analysis.  The futures expiring is a non event.  I see people putting on shorts in Bitfinex and other places.  They may be about to get btfo again.  I think this thing is going to shoot up once fear of the unknown is past.

You conveniently left out the whole bear market that preceded this.

Well it's kinda weird being mentioned like this, but I stream every morning on YouTube as SpeculatorSeth so if people have questions stop on in and I'd love to discuss.

Well I'm not giving it away.  I post charts of it...for 20 people.  Hardly enough to affect the market.  And if it was popular  that would probably eliminate the edge.  However, it would also make Bitcoin more stable which in the end benefits me more than what I get from the trading.  I'm confident in my ability to adjust to changing markets.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:43:21
I post charts for other coins by popular request, but I've found most coins are too small for it to be truly useful.  It gives you a good feel for coins.  For instance XVG trades low compared to its usage, but they all just follow Bitcoin so you can't really trade off that valuation.
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:53:00
Correct.  I'm speculating based on the fact that last time we saw this behavior in the model there was manipulation from Mt Gox going on.
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:20:35
When my price indicator gets over 150 you're at severe risk of a crash.  We've seen it get to 200 in the past.  However, for it to get to these levels in the past it took fraud pushing price to do it.  For instance, the Mt Gox crash.  So my theory is that we're seeing fraud right now of the same type as the Mt Gox days.
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:31:04
Well during Mt Gox the exchange was buying coin with dollars that basically didn't exist.  Or perhaps you could run a stablecoin that is supposed to be backed 1:1 with dollar reserves, and then print new coins without having the dollars to back it up. That's the sort of fraud that my indicator seems to suggest is happening.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:31:33
What do you believe was a prediction that was wrong?  I do post upper and lower bound prices, but you should look at those as more moving targets more than anything.  When the indicator gets to 100 it's overbought, and 150 to 200 is crash imminent.  When it's below 50 you have your best risk reward to buy.  It's pretty easy to see the historical probability from the chart. 
And it's been right on the trades we've called, and I have made money from buying when it says.  You would miss this last rally, but like I said it's being driven by fraud.  I'm not the only one with this kind of method that's showing something is up either.

You would need to pay for a data feed like cqg or rithmic.  I get it through amp futures, but I'm only paying for cme data.

There's a dozen reasons you might do this.  The only thing you can be sure of is that you were meant to see it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:45:59
If you want to go long you might as well just buy cash on coinbase.  Futures are more of a day trading instrument.  You could go long in options though so there's that.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:28:41
Buy at $1.00.  Everyone else sees the move and decides to jump on board.  While they are buying it up to $2.00 you're selling it to them.  The mania ends and price starts to decline as others take profits as well.  You buy it from them.  Then when everyone's moved on you pump it again.  
It's all about creating price movements that will attract interest from others.

As I explain in this video it is pretty normal for new products to have low volume and liquidity:
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:19:14
No but it will make arbitrage a lot easier which would hopefully make prices more stable and thus yes it would be harder to create a panic sell flush.  But selling in the futures could still cause selling in the cash exchanges.  So overall I do think it makes it easier to short bitcoin and that could affect the value.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:44:55
I guess it depends on what you consider to be the user base.  These guys won't be keeping positions outside their trading session.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:06:05
My own analysis indicates that Bitcoin is extremely overbought here.  If we run into a situation where price goes below a major support zone (ie below the 12,000 - 13,000 from Thursday), and the mempool is overloaded, you'll end up with a lot of trapped longs.  See here for my indicator that I believe shows we are overbought:
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:00:39
I'm not surprised that the launch of the futures has so far been a non event.  There was some buying on the open, but still within the range we have traded this weekend.  The change futures have on the market will not be apparent for quite some time.  As more participants join the futures that will change.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:09:26
I tend to agree.  At the moment the chart looks like a H&amp;S on the daily chart with confirming volume on the down bars.  Many of the things that rescued price in the past have failed, including large tether prints.  My indicator predicted a crash before this recent downturn.  If the pattern plays out this time the way it has in the past we should see $8k or lower.
But anything can happen.  I'm just telling you what my readings are saying.  Just trying to give people more than just "feels like it's time".
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:06:45
I made a video about this that I think will give you a satisfactory answer.  Basically the effects of futures in the market may not be felt ask at once.  It's like the mother of all non events:
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:15:53
I made a video a few weeks back that gives some of the basics about how futures work and how it might affect Bitcoin.  Might answer a lot of the questions I'm seeing in the thread.  The margin requirements are far too rich for me, but I'll certainly record the order flow and sim trade it for the channel.  I might be pulling an all nighter :)

You're betting against someone else.  So all of the guys that lost money have money withdrawn from their accounts and that is used to pay the guys that won.

The problem with the technical analysis presented in this sub is that there is no historical track record presented.  A pattern is useless unless you know the probability.  Even then we may be talking about only a 5-10% edge. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 18:54:35
This is my price target.  Wouldn't be surprised if they go to $1000 just for fun, but $1500 is the low end of fair. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:07:46
I will make a video for you guys tonight but basically.
Say bitcoin index is trading at 6500.  The future is trading at 6502.  You could arbitrage it by selling the future, and buying bitcoins on the exchange.  You make the two dollars, and are hedged against any movement until the future settles.
So arbitrage would keep the two in line.  If a big seller sold the futures, arbitrage would cause the bitcoin exchanges to sell too, assuming there are enough market makers playing the arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:34:55
To naked short then you would of course have to borrow Bitcoins from someone else.  I haven't used the Bitcoin exchanges, so I don't know what kind of services they have to facilitate such a trade.  Perhaps it would help if you laid out the full scenario you are looking for here.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:09:32
Here's my video:
If the question is will selling in the futures cause people to sell bitcoins the answer in my view is yes.  How you perform the trade all depends on your specific situation.  If I were to perform it I would probably keep an inventory of bitcoins on one of the exchanges.  Sell some of my inventory when I see an opportunity, and take the opposite position in the futures.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:40:01
The problem I see happening is this increases the amount of discussion in bitcoin, but not the amount of actual bitcoin users.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:36:29
You aren't hedging against having to deliver.  You're just hedging against movement in the asset in general.  You just want to make the difference between the future and the exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:20:34
Implying that CME traders are behind such volatility is amusing.  Considering that the futures will be worth $25 per dollar, you're talking about a $20k per contract move!  Will regulators approve that?  We'll see I guess.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:40:42
Stop orders for sure.  I've been calling short for months on my daily notes on Patreon (search for Speculator Seth).  So keep in mind I've been a bear for a while and even I am surprised at how forcefully they broke that long term 6k support. 
Some of this might be related to Bitcoin Cash fork, but I still see more pain.  That's months of buyers going negative on the year.  At some point taxes and paying the bills for crypto related companies comes into play.
My call since may has been $2k.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:30:49
I also trade futures (Z's), and I think you are spot on.  Oil is a great comparison.  There's a lot of retail speculation in oil, and it moves all over the place.  However, ultimately the oil companies that actually take and give delivery keep things in line.
Bitcoin futures would be similar but much worse.  You're creating an instrument that is purely speculative, and not forcing anyone to actually take delivery.  
In effect you are giving the larger financial world the opportunity to speculate on bitcoin.  What do you think they're going to do?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:56:09
Well of course not because spoos is cash settled on the SPX.  Just keep in mind though that the SEC blamed the flash crash in part on trades in ES that caused everyone to pull their liquidity.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:26:29
This is the biggest pile of bullshit I've ever seen in a financial article.  Treasuries weren't the safety trade?  My performance in ZN futures this week says otherwise.  On Tuesday we moved a whole two points in treasuries.  Moves that are almost unheard of.  Traders sold equities and bought treasuries, and the author arguing otherwise completely discredits everything else he says.
Bitcoin was not acting as a safety trade.  If it was we'd be a lot higher than we are today.  Not to mention that the moves just aren't very correlated with the drops in equities, particularly as the week went on.  We all remember the big days in November when lots of people entered the market.  It was nothing like this week.  The truth is that Bitcoin's fundamentals and ecosystem are stable enough to sustain $8k.  Only aggressive shorts and FUD can push it any lower, and only for a short time.  What we saw in Bitcoin was a short covering rally which hopefully will be followed by a pickup in interest and a new bull run next week.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:29:44
It's true that many futures participants are not taking delivery, but it's mostly only the equity index futures that are actually cash settled contracts.
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:05:55
Ultimately, yes for BTC to become what it was envisioned to do, you eventually want firms to trade it.  You'd need the regulatory framework required to become more legit.  That's also why there's almost 0 chance Goldman would trade it at this time.  It opens them up to too much risk.  Particularly risk in the form of being used to launder money etc.  It would take time to get the industry to where it would need to be. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:18:01
Nonono, that's not how it works.
Settlement is cash.  So when the contract expires, you are paid the difference between the price you bought, and the reference index price.  So if the futures price moved significantly down compared to the index it would cause people in the futures to buy it because they could make money from settlement.  Hence price stays mostly in line with the index.

Right so now that we've had three comments saying the exact same thing that doesn't address my content at all we can safely assume there's a shill effort going on.  So I guess I'll respond.
Does Blankfein even know the difference?  He could just be using the hash tag because it is more visible.
This does not by any means indicate that they're going to start trading btc or similar.  They may develop their own technology for otc markets for instance.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:43:19
Given the way he talks about this, it isn't clear if he's talking about bitcoin or blockchain in general.  Having worked there in technology, I'm pretty skeptical they'll be trading BTC any time soon if ever.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:11:47
This is incorrect.  6J is settled with physical delivery.  An example of a cash settled future would be an equity index like ES.

It's more than just pathetic.  I work on stock trading systems at a bank, and as expected I can't tell you much.  But I can tell you our capacity per second is orders of magnitude higher, and that when we profile these things we are using microseconds.
But in their defense it is a completely different animal trying to make a web based system that is easy to interface with and is accessible to all.  It's a different game compared to say FIX.
