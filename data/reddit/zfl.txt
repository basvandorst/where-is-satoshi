As long as that isn't your only retirement savings, go for it.

There's a pretty strong uptrend right now that appears to be on its second leg. Buy on a pullback day which consequently looks like will happen today.

No. See above.

From a PR perspective I think that's brilliant. Personally though I can't give anything with a "democratic" label a positive spin and sleep at night. Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what to eat for breakfast--tyranny of the (brainwashed, propgandized) majority.

This also has issues. The exchanges can just go offshore our out-of-bounds like online gambling did in the U.S. It may push Bitcoin further underground but it would still exist.

conflating consumer good technologies with money commodity technology is a mistake.

So quantum computing can be used to break Bitcoin but cannot be used to strengthen Bitcoin?

I might worry about that if it were pre-1995.

Good intentions, ignorant economics.

I hope not. I hope to have some of that "exorbitant privilege" myself thank you very much.

Depending on the industry, BitPay and the like may or may not be a viable (read: competitive) option.
After you account for all fees (wire fee back to dollars), BitPay isn't any cheaper than a standard fiat currency denominated payment gateway and merchant system.
For businesses with wide enough margins, start-up capital or niches this may work for a time. But Bitcoin will never reach critical mass until it becomes **at least** on par with dollars when dealing up and down the supply chain.

All he'd have to do is use a live Tails USB in some public wi-fi access place with no security cameras.
Not that hard.

With this justification you can invest in anything, so why ask?

I think you misunderstand gold bugs. They're not interested in logic, reason and evidence any more than your everyday religious person.
