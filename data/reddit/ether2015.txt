Sad but most people simply don’t care about data sovereignty.

Some people just don’t get it. Bitcoin could be at &gt;$100k for decades and there will still be people like him.

It’s just going to reinforce his belief that crypto is scam after his dinner with Justin Fuckin Sun

It won’t follow the exact same 2013-2017 pattern but generally it’s still going to be a slow grind up to the previous ATH and then a parabolic rise before a crash in the end.

Whether it will benefit is unknown but it’s not going to be negatively affected by a recession since its an uncorrelated asset. It’s performance is not directly tied to corporate earnings, interest rates, etc.
My personal opinion is that Bitcoin is anti-fragile and it gets stronger every time it survives from stress and chaos, because every time it recovers the more confidence people have in it going forward. 
Bitcoin is not the same bubble like tulip bulbs or south sea stocks. Those bubbles burst and they never recover. Bitcoin recovers and is twice as strong, just like a Saiyan.

I really want to see a pic of Zuck standing in between the twins like that one with Jihan.

The best time to buy BTC is always at/near its long term trend line. Funny it also tends to be when people don’t want to buy and morale is low.

lol at the expected 6k “major resistance”. The TA geniuses think it has to be hard to crack just because we broke down from the big meme triangle. Turns out BTC simply doesn’t give a fuck.
