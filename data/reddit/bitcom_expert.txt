The best way to lose all your money is to sell when the price goes down, and buy when it starts going back up. 
Wash, rinse and repeat and you'll be poor pretty quick.
The trick to sound investment is not an equation, but understanding fundamentals and then determining if they are fairly solid.  After that, you buy when everyone (including yourself) want's to sell, and sell when everyone (including yourself) wants to hold.
I don't see anything fundamentally different about bitcoin in the long term.  The IRS law can be changed, and it doesn't represent the entire world.  And don't forget, bitcoin cannot be "banned" anymore than bittorrent can be "banned".  Laws can be changed, and bitcoin will be there when they do.
That's my opinion, you do what you want with your money - but I'm not selling any bitcoins.

Actually, your argument is valid in common law as long as you can get a large enough people to agree with you.
If enough people agree that the law is bullshit, then they will have to change it.  Look up jury nullification.

We need buyers and we need sellers, and we need people using the bitcoin economy... that's true.
All I'm saying is that I see no good reason to sell your bitcoins for less than you bought them for - if you bought them for $600 or $1000, then just hold onto them.  Again - that's my opinion... but that's all I'm trying to say.

lol.  Then we all don't give a fuck, a singularity forms, and it the whole system implodes.

I'm pretty sure that's the exact opposite of good investment advice, lol.    You're missing the part where everyone (including myself) is going to be tempted to sell or buy based on emotion when the price moves and end up in the poor house.  
If you think bitcoin is *useful in the marketplace* and *likely to be around when people want to use it* then you should buy when the price is low.  There are a lot of other fundamentals to look at, and I'm not suggesting that I know them all.... and I'm not suggesting I know the future because I don't.
I completely agree that it could do anything, and that people should do what they believe is right... I'm just trying to point out that you should never buy and sell based on price and emotions alone.

ATMs are tied to a card that gets chits out of an account with *your name on it that you created at the bank after going through an extensive KYC process.*
Whenever you show up to the ATM, with the card, and enter the PIN - the assumption is that it's you.  And that assumption is confirmed (if needed) through video tape only if you assert that a transaction was made by someone else.
Robocoin is not like an ATM, because they don't know you yet.  It's more like an automated bank.  They have to put you through the KYC process before they can create your account.

Yes... rational growth, right?

Are you telling people that they should sell ASAP?
