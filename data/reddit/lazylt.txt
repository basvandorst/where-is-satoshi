According to google, his personal net worth is $24.1 billions. If i was him, i would have went all in on Bitcoin with a market order after realizing am about to lose $130 millions. But again, that's probably why i'm not rich in the first place. Hope he is a Reddit user and picks up this plan tho.

One does not simply sell his coins if he believes that it's USD,EUR etc. that have no future. But of course, a man should at least get some coke if he made a decent profit, that won't hurt.

I love how you all always so happy because of "minor" price increase but never sell your coins to take profit, so what's the point, really? :D
