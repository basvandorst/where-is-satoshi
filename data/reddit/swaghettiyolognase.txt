I mainly use bitcoin for online gambling, like dicing and betting on sports, poker etc, i am looking to buy a new phone with bitcoin, just deciding what phone to get and looking for a good deal

There already is an altcoin for this, that is accepted by various companies and business people in the industry

I agree it does need to be near instant, bitcoin should really fork to work with zerotime, but any drastic changes and r/bitcoin has a panic attack because its not what satoshi dreamed off or some bs

someone already answered your question stop being so autistic google vanilla coin 
@_date: 2015-09-20 23:46:10

100's of dollars of bitcoin at purchase price to buy a cheap kids toy doesn't seem that good to me

"My understanding was that you wish a Bitcoin blocktime reduced from 10min to "zero time" 
I mentioned zerotime as an example along with "cash" of near instant cash transactions in a reply to someone's comment :)
i wish for the blocktime to be reduced, and block reward split accordingly e.g. we reduce the average block time to 1 min so the reward would be 2.5 per block instead of 25. to make bitcoin faster for consumers and business's
 ***businesses arent using the bitcoin blockchain and are creating there own because the confirmation time is to slow*** 
it also solves the block size debate as blocks could stay 1mb they would just be more frequent
@_date: 2015-09-20 22:31:39
I dont think you understand what zerotime is?
its instant trustless seconds, fractions of a second before you payment is confirmed and cant be double spent, zerotime already exists so i dont understand your comment

No one will harrass you for beating cryptography :) it will help the community grow and better itself :)

Lol sorry for your bad investment, do you atleast trade to hedge your invest, going all in on anything is very risky
@_date: 2015-09-20 22:34:36
cash is instant, there is also instant crytocurrencies confirmation is done in fractions of a second no chance of double spend, bitcoin is old

when is lightning network eta? bitcoin is not evolving with the time and will die because of this, devs are looking at bitcoin from a code only perspective not a marketing perspective if they dont improve a new cryptocurrency will take over bitcoin and that is an undeniable fact
@_date: 2015-09-27 01:38:05
why does this get ignored? when its really fucking important? r/bitcoin being ignorant again
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:10:48
The thing that scares me with this is IBM will advertise the shit out if this, bitcoin get's minimal advertising, and the average consumer doesn't give a shit about decentralised systems, this will potential take a lot of potential customers away from using btc, leaving it only usefull as a payment network, if this happens bitcoin needs to reduce it's block time to compete or it will keep depreciating in value

Johnny: hey mum i think i've saved nearly 100$ :D
Mum: I'm Sorry johnny but after buying this piggy bank and bitcoin price still collapsing you actually know owe me $40
Johnny: WTF i hate bitcoin

Block interval is very relevant 10 minute confirmations is 1 of the reasons bitcoin will never succeed 
@_date: 2015-10-02 13:02:57
You realise by the time these solutions are done bitcoin will be overtaken by other cryptocurrencies that arent afraid to evolve, bitcoin is old tech and needs to be updated to meet consumer needs
lightning network for example eta 2050??? what is up with that
@_date: 2015-10-02 01:15:34
haha, i know it requires a hardfork and isn't just some ohh lets change  the block time and it's done. im well aware of what my suggestion entails, 1 blocks benefits bitcoin for consumers making it viable to pay for goods in shops, it also benefits business massively, in a business environment you don't need to be waiting 10 minutes most likly more for information to be verified, business's are building there own block chains because of the slow block time because having it on chain is way to slow :)
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:09:20
There are already many many blockchains that don't use Bitcoin so your statement is incorrect, as an example check out  for literally hundreds of blockchains without bitcoin :)

This deserves a million upvotes, one of a few decent posts in the monstrosity of crap on the subreddit, when decent ideas are discussed you get hit by a storm of downvotes and troll's
bitcoin need's to be updated to meet consumer needs, the quicker this is realised the better, block size is not the issue but block time is, 10 minutes is ridicoulous for a crypto curency, it should be reduced to 1 min/ 30 seconds or even smaller with the 1mb max still in place this would hugely benefit bitcoin.
