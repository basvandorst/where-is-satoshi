It's hard to tell, but in listening to some of his interviews, it sounds like he originally wanted Twitter to be a free speech platform, but kind of got pressured into making too many compromises on that. Maybe he sees Bitcoin and cyrptocurrency more generally as a long run workaround on that.

So that guy's totally safe. A true scammer would never be that obvious!

Anyone else bothered by that cliff in the graph in July 2010? The just means there was no price data - but they just go ahead and draw an arbitrary line to some arbitrary tiny small price.  
Aside from that - cool graph! I'm pro log-chart.

People would have been better off in December 2017 looking at the log chart too - they would have seen that the rise was not unprecedented - and it would have given people and idea of what the prices would look like when they revert to the trend.

That looks better!
Now that I think about it - the price was more indeterminate than zero.  It might have been zero from the seller point of view (can’t offload bitcoin) - but it would not have been free from the buyer’s point of view. At the very least it would be the cost of mining.

I think there would still be a net-increase in energy usage, just not by as much as we would expect in a static model (where prices remain the same).
If the demand for energy goes up because of Bitcoin mining, that would be the equivalent of a demand curve shift. So prices will rise, but that will incentivize suppliers to create a bit more and consumers will conserve a bit more.

That's a good point - I had considered it, but I wanted to simplify things for the podcast because there's already a lot to chew on.
The way I see it is this: the transaction fees are currently only a fraction of block rewards. So, if someone is going to argue that it's the transactions fee which are going to drive an exponential blow-up in mining, then the burden is on them to show that transaction fees are going to have this big blow up. And that's not individual transaction fees, but total transaction fees per block.
I don't believe that's going to happen. I think that whenever the transaction fee gets uncomfortable, it encourages off-chain transaction technology, the main one being the lightning network but other possibilities include side-chains and centralized stores like Coinbase.

They also consume time - an even more scarce resource! I give them too much of mine, even though it's probably not in my best interest.

I agree with you 100% - but it's good to win the argument on every level. If people wanted to consume lots of energy to mine Bitcoin, that is their, but it's also good to have the economic/fiscal argument in hand that no, this will not "eat the world".
