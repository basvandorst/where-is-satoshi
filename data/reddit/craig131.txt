That's true, but imagine how much that "astronomical tax" revenue would increase if those same companies could sell heroin and prescription painkillers to anyone without a perscription as openly as SR did...

Hmm but then the malicious driver would have to be bundled with the unmodified version of Ubuntu. So it would have had to slip past all of the many people auditing that open-source code. It seems unlikely.

I still believe we should pressure apple to accept Bitcoin apps. After using both rooted Android and jailbroken iOS devices extensively I firmly believe that the tight restrictions placed on Appstore apps lead to a higher overall quality. Their policies aren't perfect, but they are constantly changing as they listen to user feedback. Android's 'almost anything goes' policy looks great from a freedom perspective, but in my opinion Apple's ecosystem is far superior because of their high level of quality control. This is one of the reasons why I am not planning to ever buy an Android device again. I think Apple will learn soon enough that Bitcoin is something to embrace, not to fear.

It's my phone but I appreciate the effort they go through to weed out all the garbage when it comes to the Appstore. I jailbreak to get an escape from the walled garden which allows me to install anything I'd like. Of course Apple doesn't allow this, but it makes sense to me that they want to have a product that always reflects a clean, serene beauty that to some looks like a restrictive walled garden.

From this comment by the creator


The generate-wallet.html file on the CD has a corresponding (detached) PGP-signature, just like in the github ZIP.
It appears to be an unmodified version of Ubuntu with just a few self-contained files included to generate wallets made from open-source code which can be verified.

Thank you for this. People are assuming the FBI claims that the Captcha was served directly from the unmasked front-end (impossible), but your idea makes more sense (outside of the FBI blatantly lying, which is still sadly possible, but it makes their job much more difficult.)

I highly disagree. If you have ever used one for more than a few minutes, which I doubt, you would find that the main things they lack are customization (which would be an important feature for child's toy I might add), not as powerful hardware, but still balanced, and a completely free Playstore. I am curious to why you think these shortcomings make them equatable to a toy for a child.

I don't think they are trying to pick a side, they just want to keep consumers safe. They are erring on the side of safety when it comes to bitcoin apps because they simply don't know enough about its benefits. Give them time and they will see that bitcoin isn't just for buying illegal drugs over the internet or money laundering. It's a revolutionary concept so it makes sense that people will take a long time to adapt.
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:56:06
Do you really think they should use that philosophy when approving apps? They are certainly misguided about Bitcoin currently, but that can easily change once they learn more and find out how important it is becoming for consumers.

Basic functions of a computer. Like terminal access, free reign over the hardware, and the ability to view and modify the filesystem? I agree these are important features that Android provides. However most consumers don't need or want those things. The small minority that do can easily jailbreak (shoutout to which provides all those features and more. I can tell you exactly which tweak will provide any of your 'exclusive' Android features that works beautifully with the latest firmware. By the way, every iOS version is possible to jailbreak currently, except for the latest 7.1 betas.

.onion sites exist on normal servers, their physical location is just harder to track down because of how the traffic is routed.

Everything on this CD is open-source and you can verify the hashes and signatures to make sure the programs are unmodified.

I agree, it just seems *too perfect*. A coding error on the minimal login page means that the investigators didn't have to be logged in to the site and didn't have to click agree to the terms and services. Also they do not have to admit to de-anonymizing Tor hidden services (which they may or may not have the ability, now we will not find out). It's just an all around perfect way for them to disclose how they found the location of the server.

I've tried switching and you're right, that is an awesome feature. However..


I have found that it's not immediately obvious if the results are "as good as possible". I've searched for problems (part of my job) on DDG and spent quite a bit of time reading through the top, promising looking results, yet at the end there was no real useful solution to be had. Then later I searched Google for the same term and the top result was exactly a perfect, brief solution. This is the reason I will probably never set DuckDuckGo as my default search engine. It's easy to pipe your term into another engine through DDG, but with trickier searches a lot of time will be wasted before finally utilizing this feature.

I assumed that it was possible to compare the hash of an untouched Ubuntu image with the hash of this livecd's image minus the wallet generation files. I didn't know that there wasn't one hash that covers the entire image, and that it's only possible to check the hashes of individual components. I am a bit ignorant about security in general, so I probably shouldn't have been speaking with authority.
Sorry for the potential misinformation guys. It would probably be best to wait until this tool is fully audited by experienced people before using it.

They don't *always* play those cards.. It just happens that a lot of what we, the internet, generally care about (weed, encryption, privacy, crypto-currency, transparent security agencies) happen to fall into the category of things that can and do directly benefit terrorists and drug users (not that the two are related, I only put them together because of how you worded your post).
It's an inconvenient truth.
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:41:14
I never said that bitcoin users "support terrorism". That's just twisting my words. My point was that crypto-currency like bitcoin is a very good way for terrorists to securely send money over arbitrary distances. Do you disagree with this?

It doesn't quite fit with what Gavin said about how Craig could have "hacked the hotel's wifi" to provide a fake Electrum page. However, I would be surprised if they didn't secure the connection in some way. Maybe Gavin worded it like that just to keep it more straightforward.

That might be feasible if done in a novel way people haven't seen a billion times already, but I was referring to what you said: "There are better stories to spin if it is just simple market manipulation."

'A' should be market manipulation. Just look at the charts, it's a bit crazier than normal.
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:28:57
I think you need to think about this more. Craig has a huge influence over the market right now. He's already established himself to be completely unpredictable. No one knows what will happen next (only that the value will drastically shift in the short term depending on his behavior) except for him. There are many things he could post on his blog that will make the market shift in an easily exploitable way.

But there are quantum computers out there, maybe not advanced enough to mine blocks, but they are solving problems thousands of times faster than binary computers. I think you underestimate how much technology can progress in 10 years.

That's what people think *every time* a new big step in mining technology occurs, and it becomes available to consumers. In &lt;10 years when quantum computers become mainstream, we will feel the same way, and laugh about how we though ASICs were "endgame".
It's a cycle that's slow enough that most people don't see its cyclical nature. A few dozen years after quantum computers, we will likely have technology that makes even them obsolete, and again we will wonder (if we still remember) how we thought QC was the pinnacle of computing technology, and that this time we are sure that we have reached the end of the line.
@_date: 2013-06-01 01:35:24
Fair enough. However I vividly remember FPGA enthusiasts saying the exact same thing, and before that I'm sure many people thought GPUs were the pinnacle of mining potential. It's strange that the future is so hard to predict, yet we spend so much time and energy trying to do just that.

Yes, I was referring to the D-Wave model, specifically the one Google purchased. 


You clearly know much more about this than me, as I do not understand why Shor's algorithm is significant to what defines a true quantum computer. However, my timeframe for consumer-grade quantum computers is largely irrelevant to my previous argument. Frankly, it seems to me that you are more interested in validating your vast knowledge of quantum computing than to disagree with the point of my initial post.
Even if quantum bitcoin mining is not going to be possible for hundreds of years, there will still be large intermediary jumps in bitcoin mining technology. There is no reason to believe that ASICs are the 'endgame'.
