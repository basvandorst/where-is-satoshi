Never have money in the market which you can't loose.  
That's the first rule of investing money in anything

A fair question: What haveyou people bought with bitcoin in the last month?  
If the answer is "nothing" then you know exactly the exchange rate. Fiat only has value because you can exchange it.

The stock market has no memory. It doesn't go up just because you believe in it.  
I'm sorry

HODL your ~~german mark~~ bitcoin like it's 1923!
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:31:51
Okay, lemme offer something to you:  
You buy bitcoin today from me, for todays price - 20 % and I deliver them to you in a year or so.
It's a massive win for you, since you basically bought assets which 1) gain in value and 2) you paid 20% less

Game design is fairly unpopular because you can't make big money. That's sad because it's one of the more interesting fields.

Do people even use it for paying anymore? The only reason I liked bitcoin was because one can use it without being at risk of credit card information lost. Now it seems to be some sort of investor circle where thousands of people pump their money into a system so a few can benefit. These few then buy teslas and whatnot which creates more people who "spend money to make money" on a super-volatile stock.
Really, this stuff is so volatile it's off the risk chart.

You can't get healthy 4-5 % per year on bitcoin. You get +1000% in the first year and then -100% in the second year.
It's highly unstable and not a good investment

Bitcoins mimics the exact path every bubble takes. It's a steep increase in value which is completely separated from the real value of that asset and then crashed when everyone tries to sell high at once

Bitcoin is mainly run by a few chinese mega-miners. Every time a split happens their profit margin is endangered. I don't think mining ("keeping the network alive") will be worth it in a few years.
Also, the chinese gouverment is extremely anti-bitcoin. When they get a hold on those miners then bitcoin is basically dead.

Is "dip" a secret word for the anticipated market crash?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:23:32
This seems like you have personal investment into the crash. Do you have bear investments or do you just want to tell bitcoinheads "in your face!".

"This time will be different" is the biggest lie in economics

If someone would be right 51% of the time this person could walk down wall street and make millions.  
Nobody knows "investemt". Wealth Distribution Theory indicates one gets only rich by one cause: luck.

Oh man, maybe I should have invested back when it was $100/BTC.

Every stock is a closed money system. All the money people now get from selling high is the same money people lost in the early days.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:08:21
I totally agree with you.  
This subreddit became infested with wanna-be investors who don't realize they pump all their money into a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:12:59
[It's more close to 80 % according to MW](

BTC crash in 3... 2...
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:23:04
This subreddit will become a hellscape once bitcoin crashes. Everyone expects to become a millionaire by this but guess what: It ain't gonna happen.
I know near-to-noone who made profit in the dot com bubble. And I know a lot of people who invested back then. Many of which are still paying their dept til today.

Then show me your data. Every asset has _reasons_ to grow. Everything seems to be a wise investment from some angle.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:26:25
Hah, you americans are funny.  
(_looks up tuition cost_).  
Oh shit you are actually paying money for this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:34:35
This is a shitpost by the way. Doing this would basically be robbing from you. Google "bear market".
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:00:15
Wow! Erstaunlich!
