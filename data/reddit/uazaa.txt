crypto prices would go down, people need money so they'd cash out. Gold woukd go up as usual because it's more stable investment.

Segwit adoption does not seem to have rised recently, and LN is way too small on the main-net to make a dent in the fees. Others suggested it's due to the increase in the hashrate or maybe less people are using Bitcoin.

BCash blocks are already full? That's really embarrassing for them.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:14:33
Wish they would have addressed bitcoin's volatility.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:45:04
Don't Dapps require something like the Ethereum Virtual Machine? How can LN support something like that?

Poor quality post.

Buffett is famous for saying that technlogy is overhyped back in the 90s. One of his biographies I read started the book with this fact, that it was his biggest mistake, especially since he was close friends with Bill Gates even back then

The biggest BTC wallet is Bitfinex cold wallet, holds $2bn. Why they chose to keep such a collosal amount on a single wallet I don't know, but it seems pretty stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:20:59
That's a good question, there are some articles discussing this mathematically and it's pretty complex.
Example: 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:19:50
I agree with you, I think it's weird core are against increasing to block size to 2mb. A 2mb block size increase + segwit is virtually the equivalent to a 4mb block size in the past.
But I really wished big blockers were more aware of the short lived relief a bigger block size would offer.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:00:21
I don't think people are pretending that there is no issue at the moment, you may need to spend more time in this sub. 
Your attitude is very short sighted, you're not seeing the forrest because of the trees: increasing the block size is a temporary solution. It's like having high blood sugar and taking meds to lower it instead of fixing your diet.
The great news is that there is a solution and the devs are close to releasing it, this is of course LN.
Any popular coin with it's current implementation will run into a scaling problem that bitcoin is facing now at a certain amount of traffic, ETH handles more traffic than BTC but it still ended up being congested recently, their long term solution will also involve side-chains like LN.

He was a drug kingpin and he himself admitted it.
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:51:42
They shouldn't even mention it, it's embarrassing to add it so late. They should just put it in the release notes.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:24:24
My question (the comment from the OP) references that page.
@_date: 2018-06-18 10:51:53


No you don't.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:24:00
Aproximatively, by how much?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:25:11


Any dates for this? I know LN is alpha since this month, but do we have any estimates for when it will be usable on the main net?
Also, what does development in this actually mean? AFAIK, no modifications to bitcoin are needed to have LN, so they're working on implementations that wallets will use?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:26:17
Best way to understand is by video, check youtube, there are videos out there.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:54:56
That's quite a bit, 60%.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:39:38
Do BTC end users get to benefit from this in any way?
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:33:25
By how much would the size of an average transaction drop due to segwit being enabled?
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:07:32
I understand, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:29:15
Someone who knows better should correct me but roughly: you need to use a segwit enabled wallet, and send coins to another segwit enabled wallet. And only after a few transaction on that wallet you really start to benefit from it.
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:05:22
Thanks for taking the time to give a long answer, I appreciate it.

This meme is supposed to be a smart guy. What's smart about this?
And the "truth" part adds nothing, you can put that on any meme.
This is the worst thing I saw today. Might as well post it to r/comedycemetery and @_date: 2018-04-19 19:03:40
Both these comments are sad, ego driven.

Do you think that the implementation of Segwit + Lightning Network would make Bitcoin ready for mass adoption?

@_date: 2017-05-09 10:23:43
Yeah, some alt coin have valid value to them.
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:19:53
I am new to cryptocurrencies so maybe this is obviously wrong, but if Bitcoin succeeds in the long run, why wouldn't litecoin (or some other coin) succeed as well? Even if it's just piggybacking on bitcoin's success, alternatives are always good and needed.
And some crypto currencies seem to be based on serious business models, Ripple and Factom come to mind. 
Ethereum is a very interesting network, especially now with DApps.
As I said I am new to this, but I think alt coins have a future just as much as bitcoin does.

[Q 1: What is the Lightning Network?](
A: The Lightning Network is currently under development. It will become a decentralized network that enables instant off-chain transfer of the ownership of bitcoin, without the need of a trusted third party.

It's not about him being good or bad, but about the unlikeliness of the situation.

I liked using localbitcoins but now exchanges offer considerably lower prices, at least in my country.

Hold in a cold wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:45:04
How can you get scammed using localbitcoins? If the BTC are held in escrow and you mark the transaction as "paid", what can the scammers do to trick you?
