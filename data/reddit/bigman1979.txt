Dollar Cost Average
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:39:58
I'm driving into work so it's hard for me to tell for sure but it sounds like you're saying it would take far less money than what I have suggested. Am I understanding you correctly?
@_date: 2019-10-22 02:31:20
This guy gets it if you $10 DCA everyday for 1 year it's $3,650 if 10 million people do that for one year then it's $365,000,000,000 now just imagine if 100 million people where to dollar cost average $10 everyday for 10 years that's $3,650,000,000,000. at a 3.65 trillion dollar market cap Bitcoin would be worth over $200,000. The power is in the numbers and in the slow build we don't need institutional money to make Bitcoin the new institution it just takes the people getting together and realizing what's at stake.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:19:36
Will you please do me a favor?  How much $ would each person in my equation of 100 million people need to spend to double the market cap? I'm a little fuzzy and I could of sworn that when I did the math it was less than a quarter. Like $.25 cents.

It's different now, the floor will be 10k if we slip but for the foreseeable future we will continue to climb. Risk only what you can afford.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:06:36
Damn! but you're telling me things I already know. Can you buy the Mona Lisa? How about the Constitution? I'm asking what would happen if there was no way to buy it anymore and if it's possible or not.

Taxes are paid in and collected pal you hold your own Bitcoin when you buy it
@_date: 2019-10-25 02:37:13
Yo check this out. 
$10 a day times 10,000,000 people 
$100,000,000 a day times 365 days
$36,500,000,000 per year. That's $36.5 billion.
Not really a big deal however up the ante to 100 million people.
$10 a day times 100,000,000 people
$1,000,000,000 a day times 365 days
$365,000,000,000 per year. That's $365 billion.
Scenario only needs 1.35% of the population to hit the numbers I have shown.
This would put the BTC market cap at its new all time high and it's only going to take 12 months...please share this simple formula and convince others to do the same.
PS - Hold every $10 purchase for at least 1 year 
PSS - They used to tell us the only way to have anything was to own your own home. Far less Bitcoin than house's my friends and I've seen where banking on real estate has gotten us so far.

I have no idea what made me think of this scenario thanks to all for the input.
@_date: 2019-06-14 20:42:15
Has anyone ever asked Coinbase about the FDIC info directly?
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:21:04
Not necessarily. Sell off probably won't be like you're fearing.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:30:47
What the hell is this response? Do you really think that there's not 100 million people out of 7.5 billion that can afford to invest $10 dollars a day for 1 year.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:22:58
No. Nevermind.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:08:46
Mind blown writing the movie now.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:48:54
It's not about the odds it was about the possibility that's why I was confused it's totally possible just not plausible.

Thank you.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:54:37
Pal I'm asking about a scenario where there's literally nobody on Earth willing to let go of the Bitcoin that they have and if that's possible or not. I'm not asking for price prediction or anything it's about the supply that's what I am trying to understand.
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:35:12
88Fangtastic the sell order was 3645 coins on Bitstamp. Read before you speak. Idiot.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:24:18
Hey can you weigh in here please?
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:55:13
I'm only saying that because this kind of market swing feels totally different when you're DCA'ing. Hang in there ��
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:47:08
I'm thinking the mediums of exchange are immaterial in this theoretical scenario. I'm asking if it's even possible for the supply of Bitcoin to literally dry up to only what comes from the next block.
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:03:49
No you're wrong in my scenario all of the $10 purchases are held for 1 year so that the market cap created by the 100 million people would be at least 36 and a half billion dollars. What's irritating is that I have not seen any other simpler plans to drive the Bitcoin value higher. I posted this once before and got hateful silly responses...it would work if people would just listen. ��
@_date: 2019-12-19 03:17:46
Good luck Leroy just be sure to DCA your way into all of your investments. Lest you discover that the hands can get weak.
@_date: 2019-12-08 00:43:29
I do.
@_date: 2019-12-19 03:40:53
I agree with the second part of your statement 100%. However if this group were to manifest and actually pull it off well then they'd be like the Moby Dick of whales ��

See below ⬇️
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:36:47
It's not the same. every time the floor is higher this time around look at any four digit Bitcoin as a great buy cause I think 10k is the new floor after the next peak...maybe not though who knows
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:17:27
I'm a believer too �� just skimmed your comments ��

@_date: 2019-06-23 22:14:16
Alright I'm clearly going to have to take you with me to get you to what or where I'm at. Years from now there's only the Bitcoin in the next block left there's literally nothing left for sale. Do you now get the question. Would it help if I have to say that Bitcoin is literally priceless at this point and nothing on Earth can be traded against it that will entice a single owner to sell.
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:43:22
Sweet thanks for the input have a great day enjoy the moon boy posts and lambo memes

I know HalfEazy and I'm glad but I still want you to ask yourself and your friends and family if we take the time to get together along with other people who are also like minded and interested could we move the needle with only the collected energy/will of the people.
@_date: 2019-12-19 03:03:19
ASU I have been here since May of 2017 and the numbers stopped bothering me awhile ago but I still think you're onto the same thing I am.
@_date: 2019-12-19 03:14:16
MostBoringStan is there any way things could go differently than how you are saying? How can the people win?
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:12:13
Math whether you agree or not determines everything. Period.
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:54:11
I used to think it was that simple but the math doesn't add up. I had some one tell me that the market cap was the last trade price times the total of the coins in circulation. He responded to me in a thread I started awhile back. I'm still looking for the answer to the same question. Thanks for the input 88 you're alright by me ��

I'm totally open to a vote.
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:04:31
I agree.
@_date: 2019-09-29 22:31:07
No maybe not at first but in time it could be an unarguable event. Meaning regardless of the direction of the market that at precisely the same time every week the global belief in Bitcoin could be measured in time. Think big friend.
