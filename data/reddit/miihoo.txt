Screenshotted this for the next year. Thanks for this post!

No. If you put in 10€ and the price goes down by 50%, you’ll own 5€ after that. However, if you’re planning to invest 10€ and you want to send it somewhere, the transaction fee is going to eat that investment.

How about you tell me what does an evidence mean? If we were to go out in a court, do you really think this would be counted as an evidence?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:33:19
Wow at people downvoting you for saying the truth. It's like truth hurts or something.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:23:48
Thank you Santa Claus!

I literally thought in my mind for 5 minutes when would it go down. My phone notified me it was over 6.5k€, looked back again a minute or two later and it started going down. This is really like watching a movie.

On top of your drivers license, you need to verificate another ID, for example your passport. I agree with you, the whole process is tedious and even after that I had other issues. I could have bought BTC cheaper but nope.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:36:34
Yeah, I thought it could be a difficult question. Not going to trouble you too much so thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:20:28
Do you know what’s the usual transaction fee when you send the BTCs you just bought and how long does that usually take?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:31:03
Thanks! Any examples how much it was for you or long it took

Being so ignorant to this will bite you back one day. I hope you're ready when that day comes.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:28:48
Thanks for the information! Learning something new every day.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:50:44
Yeah checked them out briefly and was pretty unsure about them. Thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:24:57
Yeah this was my thought as well. If there wasn't any alternatives I was going to do this but the fees are going to suck...

Not doubting you but when someone asks for source, they usually want direct links to the topic. Also, thanks for the heads up!

Do you think this fork will make the biggest drop? How low would you think it’s going to drop? Wanted to ask your opinion and if you want, you can PM your reply.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:13:27
Upvoted for visibility. Hopefully someone will answer because I’m curious as well. Don’t lose hope my friend!!
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:24:43
Ah, I should have guessed and that’s such a likable response. Then do you have any advices for newbies other than HODLing?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:13:17
Ah, my bad then. I should have known that tbh but that didn’t even occur to me when I replied to you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:44:20
I’m still a beginner as well so I haven’t used any other websites yet. It doesn’t need to be a passport; it can be one of the other alternatives if you have them. If you don’t want to use Coinbase, try using the search bar and sort threads from newest and you should find a ton of recommended websites. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:52:53
Alright, thanks. I thought you might have some advices but it’s all about just getting in and started.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:22:06
Do you think it would be better to buy BTC now or after the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:02:06
Thanks for this list! Which sites do you personally use? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:19:20
You have a nice brother there. How is he now? You said you invested heavily in real estate but what about Bitcoin? Other than the ones you have of course.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:24:03
Good to see you reply to me. I don’t want to be too nosey but what’s your opinion about Etherium? When you started, what kind of research did you do or did you just read this subreddit a lot? Also, do you miss doing real estate stuff?
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:47:51
Thanks for the information and good luck with everything you do!
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:33:29
I saw a pretty similar comment last week or so when it was 5500. Better to just hop on when there’s a small drop or otherwise you’ll say the same thing once it reaches 7000.
