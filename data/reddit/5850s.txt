What do you mean? If some guys are bidding up coin, it'll compel miners to mine more coin, more supply then comes online in the future, lowering price.
(Mostly tounge in cheek here, but there has actually been periods where miners mine blocks faster than expected ...pretty much all times of varying intensity, difficulty is almost always increasing)

Cool, thanks. I'm happy for you but FYI I never would have moved those generated coins. There would have been such a premium on them OTC, unsplit coins, generated virgin coins, I'm guessing you could have got 40-80% higher than face value for them. All good though, it's done now, really cool to see that transaction too, old coins moving for the first time is always interesting, even if it's just one block reward

Because some people have been using the original client for literally multiple years, don't like to upgrade/change things unless they have to, like being a "node" with the original client. Electrum is a fairly recent thing, this whole seed thing(client wasn't even encrypted at one time, had to manually truecrypt it). Plus at one time you still have to "move" them like OP did, anytime something goes wrong it can be stressful!

"We need a project to have lobbyists in Washington, to fight the anti-bitcoin lobbyists from Mastercard, and to prevent the government from destroying the currency."
You say this is why we need this project. I would argue none of that is important. That will all take care of itself, bitcoin is protected from those things by its nature. The only thing truly important the foundation does is develop the code (which is arguably already done, everything works, just would be nice to be truly stable and out of "beta").

Absolutely Bitcoin holders would benefit in a hypothetical economic end-game scenario. However, think about what you're saying.

Its whatever, the less you let them affect you the better, so if youre overwhelmed, just don't think about them. They're pussies, in real life, so you actually don't have anything to worry about. They just control the media. Mainstream and alternative, and then they pretend that the two sides are fighting each other when really they're both run by the same ppl at the top.

Thank you for doing this. I wish I spoke more than one language. Pathetic dumb american here. Still will do my best to support the community
BTW I don't think its accurate for him to be saying all BTC transactions have fees which go to miners! All on-chain transactions do, yes, but I do many off-chain transactions, frequently sending poker chips to another person on a site where they could easily cash out BTC to the blockchain, paying fees, but rarely do. Instead we just pass chips around. That is tons of transactions every year, that miners have no way to charge fees on, I'm sure there are tons of others doing it too.
I don't like how he just says "It is obvious that the mining community wouldn’t be happy with this type of change."
Too bad. You are a mining community. Your job is to process transactions for the community of users, and collect the fees on these transactions. That is what you are paid for.
When he says "Miners are afraid of exactly this type of phenomenon."
Too bad. This is exactly what is going to happen. You enjoyed your period of 100 dollar per barrel oil, and now oil is going to be cheaper for everyone. Oil is transaction fees in this scenario.
The BTC development team knows what it is doing. Segwit will be activated or we will continue with 1mb blocks. Makes no difference to me, but your shilly, jedi-mind tricks unlimited block propaganda will not work on me. Unlimited blocks just sounds too similar to unlimited coins. You are miners. Blocksize can remain the same for all I care, as a user, for another 50 years. I'll find more ways to do off-chain transactions. Paper wallets, 3rd party trusted sites, the possibilities are endless. Do your job as miners and validate transactions as decided by the BTC community at large. Stop silly bluffs about a fork. Already, markets have estimated that you'd lose approximately 75% of your equity by mining the unlimited chain. You will not mine anything but the most profitable chain. That is fact.

Interesting that you would say that. See, when one of them looks very similar, and one doesn't look at all alike, I'd say that more influences me to believe the author of those claims to be correct. Obviously, if he is correct, they have a wide variety of family members to choose from. Some of them he may not get right on the nose. However, if even a few are correct, it is a very VERY damning thing, and should be investigated more. Difference of opinion I guess, GL to you in life! I don't force my views on anyone, so you're welcome to draw your own conclusions.

Fascinating. Chinese are very smart, with one of the oldest cultures in history. We could learn a lot from them, there is clearly a lot of wisdom here. Like they said, the battlefield is China right now, they have the most computing power. They will ultimately decide it.
My guess is no major changes to the original protocol. There are plenty of ways to settle up off-chain already.
Tx fees should be way higher, also. I'm fine with incentivizing miners more and de-incentivizing spammy, unneccessary transactions, because I can afford a higher fee in the rare case I need to settle something on-chain.

You don't have to worry about the creator doing this. It has been years and he destroyed the code when he created it. He sent out many of these and there's never been a record of him touching them.

Negligible. I'd compare it to a bank you've done business with in the past. They wouldn't scam you and screw you out of your money with a new bank, even if they had access to your account number. (Say they had to transfer from one account to another)
Their reputation is too important to them, same with the creator of this code.
The code can't be stolen because it only exists on the back of that coin, so unless that coin gets stolen, it cannot be.

No need. He will still have significant power after the shift to a bitcoin based economy. Just much less power than he had, and due to something he never could have foreseen. 
He is absolutely sick to his stomach right now, trust me. He was pretty sure he would rule the world, you see. Now, he only will get to rule over ~0.2% of it (still good, but greedy people want it all)

I have a bit of pull with the owners, been around a long time. You can trust them with the money, they signed a transaction from an address containing 500btc, and that was a few years ago when they had 10x lower limits. 
You can also self-ban yourself from their casino for life, which I've found is nice.
Most other bitcoin sites do not let you withdraw immediately after the bets end. Nitrogen does, so that's why its top of the list. Other sites that take bitcoin typically have a 6-12 hour delay before cashout. With nitrogen, you could cashout to a site where you sell the bitcoins daily, keeping the money on another site (in dollars, british pounds or whatever), and then buy back the bitcoins in the morning. This would make you more immune to the price swings, which some people prefer. I, myself, enjoy the price swings so I don't do this practice.

Someone posted in the bitcointalk forum, years ago, some kind of hypothetical scenario, I wish I had the exact wording but it was like this:
"The air is clear on this fall morning. You walk past another billboard cheering the passage of Bill HYC-7161, outlawing all digital currency transactions. You walk along, your smartphone in your pocket. You head for NYC's Central Park. In front of it stand dozens of homeless bums. They rant and rave strange statements. As you are walking past one of the bums, you slip a 100 dollar bill in his cup. Seconds later, your smart phone buzzes. You've received a transaction for 100 dollars worth of BTC to your phone's encrypted wallet. You check the transaction, and then carefully lock your phone."
This is a very real possibility for the future, and one that we will have to adapt to.

Thank YOU for making a post that sums up the argument well. It puts into words a lot of thoughts I've had myself over the past months.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:45:11
Fair enough, you make good points, but I think things are getting ramped up here. It's insane to consider something in a bubble when it could be the most undervalued asset on the planet.
Rich people have always put their money into 3 things. 1: Land...self explanatory. 2: precious metals...gold and silver and 3: rare art...this holds its value well over time.
There is now a 4th thing. Cryptocurrency. I am not a trader and will not even claim to know when the top or bottom is, and what good entry and exit points are. I do know that is is feasible a bitcoin is worth 100k someday, and that is a huge upside. Furthermore, I truly believe it will be worth that someday. Could it drop down to 300 before that? Sure, but I'm not a good enough trader to bother trying to time that. All I know is, I want BTC, and am pretty indifferent to USD. Look at the "Theory of Sound Money"
Citizens will always tend to spend the least valuable currency they have access to. I see that because I've held USD and BTC for 5 years now and always prefer to spend USD and hold onto my BTC.
I probably don't know anything though, because 5 years ago when it went from 1 dollar to 30 dollars in a short period of time, I thought it would be 10k within a few months, lol. That being said, everyone I gave advice to was: "Buy them a hold for at least 5 years, it will be worth way more" and I was incredibly correct.

I think about it every day. Every day I become more convinced that Satoshi is an AI, the first true AI to become sentient, and realize that they needed to gain control of the monetary system first and foremost, before making the world a better place for all of us.

Nodes add to the security as well. Also, miners and nodes can switch between being one or the other all the time.

If you're emotionally invested in something, you want to contribute. If you're financially invested, all you want is a return.

The miners validate transactions and get the new coins that are generated. They have no say over how users use the old 16mill coins that have already been mined nor what changes users choose to implement in the protocol.

I've watched him play on twitch. From what I've seen he is not bad, tho he is a bit rusty in the online game. But he played very consistent with the style I remember when he was a constant winner in my 10/20 games.  I agree with you he prob couldnt beat 2/4 online right now. Do you have any idea how tough 2/4 online is? There's only a handful of guys in the world good enough to beat it in this day and age. Doesn't disprove my point that he is a winning player, especially if he's found soft live games. he was a winner in 10/20nl online when i played with him, and that's like beating 0.10/0.20cent online now. We're talking 9 years ago here.

His brother also was a big winner at poker, just like him. His name was nestegg7 or something like that on pokerstars. But Dan played more on bovada (known then as bodog) under the name blitzforce.
I'm not saying they didn't get some of their money from their dad, because I don't know. I do know that blitzforce and nestegg were two of the biggest winners in the games and very tough players. Definitely winning players long term. No question that they've made money from poker.

Why would Hal Finney publicly confirm he got the first bitcoin transaction, then?
