I don't know which scenario is more likely, but at least the 'slip away over time' theory has a lot of backing evidence.
I am just saying your scenario is not only backing evidence, it's completely unfeasible from a security standpoint even for clueless MtGox managers. You don't store a password locking 700k BTC in a single place, period.

'milibit' as 1/000 of a Bitcoin will be discontinued if 'bit' catches on. Also people will naturally start using 'kilobit' (1000 bits) and 'megabit' (1M bits). In the future, Bitcoin will refer more to the protocol and network technology than to the currency itself.

My lack of accuracy doesn't invalidate the argument. Systems that are prepared to handle up to 2 decimal places can accommodate currencies that don't have subdivisions. It's still true that the vast majority of currencies use up to cents and this is what people is used to when dealing with money.
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:29:04
Whatever the nomenclature is, the basic unit must be equivalent to 100 satoshis. The reason being 100% of world currencies are divided into cents, and all systems wrote in the last 50 years make that basic assumption. So it really makes a lot of sense and eases integration processes if the basic unit is 1 BIT = 100 SATOSHIS.

Some banks don't like you trading in Bitcoin and will close your account without further explanation. That said, there are plenty of banks which don't give a damn.

Even if you were right (i.e. Bitcoin needs the drug market to succeed), think for a moment where the global drug war has lead us to. Do you see the drug market diminishing every year?
Drugs will be around forever, and Bitcoin (as well as other currencies) will keep being used to purchase it. Now that SR is gone, this has a tremendous positive impact for Bitcoin (it has "passed the test"), and at the same moment various other hidden sites are rushing to take its place and generate volume for Bitcoin. I only see benefits from this event.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:24:06
Yes, I pretty much think so. Bitcoin isn't a panacea for solving all global problems and distributing wealth fairly. People who joined in late will get a smaller ROI, and unfortunately poor people tend to remain poor, and they have less access to information and thus are less likely to have heard of Bitcoin back in 2011.
If you think creating lots of alt-coins will solve the problem of global wealth distribution, you're pretty much clueless.

Speculation comes ahead of adoption, but adoption is catching on. Thousands of retailers accept Bitcoin, either directly or through payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase. You can shop at Amazon using Gyft cards bought with Bitcoin.

If Satoshi came to you back in 2009 and asked you to choose between two design choices, Bitcoin and Litecoin, which one would you pick? This is the fundamental question.
Litecoin encompasses a superior selection of parameters than Bitcoin. Yes, it's only Bitcoin code with tweaks. Yes, it lacks first mover's advantage. But from a purely design decision, it's superior. This is no demerit to Satoshi - he's the real genius. But I am sure he'd be happy to see *any* crypto-currency succeeding and taking over the world, even if that meant surpassing Bitcoin.
In the end, the market will decide how much each coin is worth.

From your reponse I understand that the bank is not keeping their client's bitcoins. I believe people in general (and I for sure) would feel much more comfortable if the Bank offered a secure wallet for their Bitcoins, from which the conversion would take place. As I understand it, sending my BTC to an exchange means an (sometimes unnecessary) additional step, and also that I will be relying on the exchange's security system for keeping my BTC, which may or may not be secure enough.
The simplest way of doing it, from an average user's perspective who is only interested in converting BTC to fiat and doesn't care about different exchanges would be: 1) open online banking; 2) select amount to convert 3) select desired rate or market rate; 4) Click OK. The system would care to fill the order using one of the available exchanges, transparently to the user.

* Are there fees associated with converting USD to bitcoin through services like MTGox?
Yes, there are, but there are alternatives to Mt. Gox, some of them are free (as in-person cash purchases. Check LocalBitcoins.com). And with the development of Bitcoin, more services/options will arise.
* As for the second, Paypal serves a similar, more widely accepted function. Why bitcoin over Paypal?
Because Paypal is evil. No, seriously, Paypal may well screw you sometime in a dispute and block your funds. This has happened multiple times and might happen with you someday (or not if you are a casual user, but do realize their policies affects a significant amount of people). Also, people from other countries are generally restricted in some way in their Paypal experience, as Paypal must abide to local regulations. Folks from India, for example, can't keep balances on their accounts (balances are automatically withdraw to their bank accounts).
And most importantly, Paypal is **very expensive**, more expensive than a credit card.

The .com/.net/.org domains are a monopoly of Verisign (yes, an american monopoly). Verisign resells these names to GoDaddy and the like, but has ultimate control over these names. They are the *Registry*. Being an american company, Verisign is subject to US law, and can seize domains on FBI's request.
Other extensions, such as ccTLD's, are subject to their respective countries laws' and can't be seized by the US gov (although they could theoretically force ICANN, another american entity, to seize the entire extension and shut down the whole country if they really wanted to, but not a single name - a catastrophic scenario nonetheless).
Why do you think Piratebay has moved to Iceland? Because it's one of the last free places in the world. Your .is name is yours unless you do some really nasty shit.
I would advise exchangers and gambling sites to secure their names in the .com space but in other extensions as well - *just in case*.

Most sites use BitPay which is a facilitator for those who can't/don't want to process Bitcoin payments. BitPay receives Bitcoins from the buyer and delivers either dollars or Bitcoins (or a mix of the two) to the seller, at a very low rate of 0.99% (which is way less than what a CC charges). For the buyer, it's an opportunity to spend their BTC, and for the seller, it's an opportunity to attend a group of people they otherwise would not. Also, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, which is VERY important for the seller. The seller can cut a bit more costs knowing **there will never be** a chargeback or fraudulent purchase.

He's a little too pessimist. The BTC stock market is in no way different than real stock markets in the sense that there are good and bad picks. Most 'investors' are actually newbies that will buy whatever is being hyped at the moment. They will lose their money. But there are stocks that will go up in value over time, because they have a solid foundation.
Look up for example the case of BTCT.CO (a popular Bitcoin stock market). It's entirely owned by LitecoinGlobal (a company running the homonym stock market). Shares of the later pay dividends based on total trading volume on both exchanges, and have soared over 500% this year with no sign of going down, because trading volume keeps increasing. This is different than mining companies, which must pour more money into the mining race all the time, or go out of business.
There are plenty opportunities for doing money, but you must do your homework.

It's a good idea and will help to increase awareness of Bitcoin even if it's USD --&gt; BTC only and not BTC --&gt; USD. There are many poorer regions / older people who are simply too used to USD to readily accept anything else. Not to mention this idea could gain a lot of traction in third world countries were Internet access is not readily available. If however your fees are high, I don't see the point of your service compared to WU or Moneygram.

No the blockchain is not needed in its entirety for Bitcoin to work. If you use Bitcoin-qt it will download it by default and work as a full node. In the distant future, only a few giant nodes will keep copies of the whole blockchain, and everyone else will use lightweight clients.

My advice: do some diversification. Instead of simply holding a stash of BTC, you can use some of your coins to fund one of the various Bitcoin related projects out there that have listed their stocks on specialized sites. That way you will not only be helping the development of the Bitcoin community, but creating the possibility of earning dividends in BTC and, if the projects are successful, you may sell shares for a higher price.
There are many sites doing just that right now, for example try BTCT.CO and LitecoinGlobal.com (the later trades Litecoin based stocks, both sites have the same look and feel).

Your premise is false. People only put money on a savings account if their goal is to keep their capital with 'zero' risk and have easy access to it wherever they are. Banks offer all sort of low to high risk investments to their clients and Bitcoin could be a new option. If you see Bitcoin as an investment you are free to do so and even then a bank could profit offering this service to you (considering you will need to convert back and forth to fiat sometimes).
Moreover, there is nothing in theory preventing a bank from taking bitcoins from their clients accounts and lending to other clients, but a much more stable market would be needed before that could ever take place.

Now it's too late, but in order to get rich you have to change your way of thinking and give luck a chance. If you believe something has a small chance of booming, you *must* speculate with a little and see what happens. Most times you'll lose or have small gains, but some times, you'll hit it big time. If you don't speculate, you can't win.
That said, you still have a chance to enter the Bitcoin economy and earn a lot of money. Start a real Bitcoin business and work hard. There's hardly any chance people will become rich buying at current levels, but you can make a difference with a real business in a nascent economy.

Playing devil's advocate here. Bitcoin's praised anonymity might not appeal to everybody. It's important to geeks, libertarians, tax evaders and criminals for sure, but is it a killer feature to the average Joe? Bitcoin has got so many powerful features that maybe anonymity could be exchanged for other features in a new centralized coin made by banks.
How about stability and convertibility? Currently, Bitcoin is plagued by intense volatility, and for those who see it as a commodity rather than a currency, the price fluctuations are nothing short of scaring. Now if a bank would mint their own cryptocoins and back them with dollars or  gold, that would bring in a much desired stability to the system. I could send my new bitdollars or bitgold anywhere in the world at a very low rate, knowing I could walk into a branch anytime and convert the digital coins back into physical dollar or gold, respectively.
Why banks would buy such an idea? Banks rely on companies like Swift to process international wires and their system is inexplicably slow and expensive. We are in the 21th century and wiring money to another country can take a full day and cost over $50. That's just plain absurd. With a new coin, banks would be in full control over transmissions and the ease of transfer would certainly increase volume. They would still make money off transfer fees, but would not share the cake anymore.
So maybe there is space for bank competition in the Bitcoin space? Please share your thoughts.

Here is my bet for the Bitcoin bulls:
Take $840 ( as base price. In the next 3 days, BTC will oscillate around base. If it oscillates positively (peak) more than negatively (bottom), you win. Otherwise I win.
Example: In the next 3 days, it peaks at $900 and bottoms at $800. You win because ($900 - $840) &gt; ($840 - $800).
Size of the bet: 10 times the oscillation of the winner side (USD). In the above example you'd win 10 x $60 = $600.
In the unlikely case oscillations are strictly equal after 3 days, nobody wins.

1. If they criminalize trade, people will resort to face to face trades as well as upcoming decentralized exchanges (e.g. colored coins)
2. You can't expect all countries in the world to forbid hosting of sites that trade Bitcoins. If your country does it, move your hosting offshore.
3. Finding who has the biggest wallet is not only hard, it's pointless. The richest Bitcoiners have already split their savings into dozens of wallets or would readily do so in the case of a crackdown.

Except that you don't (normally) agree on the date of settlement. Usually you rent the hamburger for an agreed price, and as long as you pay the rent, the hamburger owner will be happy.
However, if you sell the hamburger and it skyrockets, things start to get creepy. You must prove you have the funds for re-buying the hamburger at *any* time, even if at a higher price than you sold it for. That's called margin - if prices go up, you must leave funds held in escrow for maintaining your short position. If prices keeps rising and you can't increase your margin, your position will be liquidated (i.e. they'll buy pricey hamburger with your margin) and you'll lose your money.
There's no limit to what one can lose keeping short positions, as there's no limit to how much hamburger prices can rise.
