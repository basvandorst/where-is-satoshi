I guess I've been very secretive when it comes to the little details but I don't think those little things I'm being secretive about will be the selling point anyway I guess I'm just afraid of the criticisms b/c this subreddit can get pretty nasty.
However, your post makes a lot of sense to me and has gave me a more logical thought process when it comes to business, thank you!

No. The reasons are pretty simple, it's not possible for them to acquire all Bitcoin they could only buy a large portion of them and them buying such a huge amount would only be free marketing for Bitcoin as the price would Sky rocket thus causing the self-destruction of their own business in the regular economy. 
Attempting to buy all of the Bitcoins possible would only bring their worst fears to real life, therefore no is the answer.

Yes am I a programmer, I however have never taken a programming class I self-taught myself via the internet! 
I can code in multiple languages but I'm using C# ASP.NET to the build the internal infrastructure of the application because I'm honestly not a fan of PHP (used it a couple of times before, didn't enjoy using it)

I've created and ran a successful business previously. And it was producing, selling wholesale and selling retail game currency, I had my toes in all fields of the small 3rd party industry, unfortunately the business collapsed because the game company stopped us from producing. 
The game currency business has a lot of noticeable similarities to the Bitcoin business which makes it a lot easier for me to understand.

Well played. The Government fund a-lot of things but funding doesn't necessarily mean that it's prioritised correctly.  
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:46:00
How do you trust anything new? 
With anything new, it takes time for everyone to trust and that's the business owners job anyway to gain their customers trust and then it'll be easier to obtain trust. Scammers still exist and will exist nevertheless but I think being scammed is a-lot more avoidable than being subjected to fraud, if a website unknown to you accepts even these 'trusted' middlemen that use fiat currency, you should always consider research. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 09:50:21
Yeah! It's not as big of a deal as it sounds. The drug business is big money especially the higher up the ladder you go, we've all seen Breaking Bad!

A poor choice of words that I knew I should have edited. The market has a lot of businesses and is growing rapidly, it'll only get more difficult for small fry like myself on a daily basis! It's saturated for unfunded start ups.

One thing I definitely don't want to recreate is fucking Paypal! Fuck that garbage thieving company.
However my company will be to allow businesses &amp; consumers to buy/sell and transact with Bitcoin affectively without the flaws that companies like Coinbase have, with neat little features that other services do not provide.

The U.S are one of the biggest dealers in fossil fuels, realistically the government's priorities are certainly not ranked with the health of the environment on top.
That's why we have great people like Elon Musk.

I recommend you read a more reliable source.
Read the Wikipedia: 
If you're not interested in reading, here is a simple graph: 
Anyway, as you can see in the recent years we've had slight stabilisation and that's because of the increase in use of electric vehicles and renewable sources of energy. In my previous post I mention Elon Musk who is a great mind contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere very successfully with his projects at Tesla.
Here is an interesting watch:

It's a $7 increase, that's nothing. People need to stop upvoting this kind of garbage. Stop talking about the price, it's not important. What is important? The development of Bitcoin and introducing it to the masses, we should be pushing this technologies developments so it has the simplicity of something like the use of pen and paper. Not talking about the price! There is a reason talking about the price is banned from  IRC, it's all people want to talk about and all people are interested in, greed! Which is the very thing Bitcoin is fighting against...

Quantum computers don't exist, stop pretending you know everything.
Also replying to your logic of  "They may as well not exist because so few exist?", eh what... for something to exist there must be a "first" like the first transistor based computer or the first can of coke.... so idk maybe you're right when there is too little of something we should destroy it.

You mention fraud prevention, Bitcoin would be much less problematic when it comes to fraud than the most well known payment processors such as Paypal, Skrill and Stripe, etc...
Double spending is a very rare attack and it'd be very unlikely for these type of attacks to fool a merchant  especially if you're selling physical goods that requires shipping. Digital/instant deliveries however might be an issue if you don't wait for your transaction to get a couple of confirmations before sending the item.
Chargebacks? Non-existent in the block chain world.

They are a legitimate company as I've done wholesale business with them previously as I used to sell bulk FIFA coins to them and many other companies similar. It's definitely a legitimate request, I'm just curious as to why they think it's necessary with Bitcoin.

I guess that's the rehearsed fears of MtGox playing in their heads.
A truly decentralised exchange is a difficult one to a achieve. I've thought about it and it'd would require Satoshi like abilities that I don't have, yet.

This is what I meant by no discussion as in if you're not going to contribute anything useful then please exit the topic.
"if OP actually just wanted answers, they could go to google and search "how to double-spend Bitcoin"." 
Evidently didn't read the post so why should you discuss something you didn't entirely process? Because you're bored.
I'm looking for answers not bullshit but even when I specifically ask for NO BULLSHIT, I still seem to get it, I should really have expected that tbh the internet is full of people with ALOT of free time to burn.
Sense of entitlement? No one has to answer, you know that right? Dumbass.

Okay let's say the 'attempted' murders were fact.
Do you know why these attempted murders supposedly occurred? DPR was blackmailed, someone threatened to leak vendor and customer information. This was a threat to the marketplace potentially incriminating thousands of innocent people. 
What's more disgusting? The fact DPR was trying to protect innocent people from an unjustly criminal record or that someone was willing to publish incriminating information about innocent people, ruining potentially thousands of lives and futures for financial gain. If you were in DPR's shoes, what would have been your action? No murdering in your answer though please. :)
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:22:20
No. You need understand the premise of the dark markets. On the Silkroad marketplace items or services related to child porn or assassinations were NOT allowed. He did not try to kill innocent people or anyone for that matter, please read more into the recent story of FBI agents hijacking a-lot of Silkroad coins.
People are going to use drugs and it's not going to be stopped. We have rehabs, clinics and various meetings for people to attend, is it working? Clearly not. People may not even be addicts and might just be harmless party goers looking for some xtc or smoking some weed on the their days off work. 
Competitive markets like the original Silkroad were prospering because of the quality and purity, the drugs were as titled and not bought off some random street drug dealer who's probably going to sell you a research chemical mixed with other potentially harmful toxins. The forums of Silkroad were all for harm reduction and encouraged sharing past drug experiences to education about safety rather than pure propaganda. DPR himself even offered to pay for a drug abusers therapy.

High grade diamond is rare, diamond in it's highest grade form has extremely desirable properties and is used in the oil mining industry. There is more diamond than gold on Earth but not more 24kt diamonds than 24kt gold.
Also do you know how much gold is in that asteroid? It would affect the price drastically, it would make gold the most abundant precious metal on our planet, it would make gold worthless. The current global gold supply could fill 2 olympic swimming pools, not a whole lot when you put that into perspective.
What happens when you have an oversupply of a commodity? You really think if we announced we could start mining that asteroid at an extremely low cost tomorrow the price of gold would not be affected?

We'll be seeing Bitcoin's growth whilst Argentina is in economic turmoil. 
The day we see another dollar crash (which is inevitable) is the day we Bitcoiners will see substantial growth in our market just like gold and sliver in 2008. Bitcoin unlike gold and sliver is much easier to trade globally. The whole world will be looking at Bitcoin, you can't trust debt.

The wallet itself is not the only service I wish to provide as that would be pointless in my eyes, maybe I should have made that more clear.
It's in my best interest to keep the consumers information safe and secure, don't worry about that! That's why I ask my question, is it best to have 2 wallets for the service and assign addresses from that wallet accordingly (Cold&amp;hot) or give the users a wallet each? (Which I'm having difficulty doing or finding any information on). 
@_date: 2015-11-10 10:12:06
I don't know, ask Coinbase, Blockchain, CoinJar, BitPay, Bitstamp why they're so popular or the majority of Bitcoin businesses, the list goes on and on! 
Don't like those services? Too bad, they help push Bitcoin adoption massively and are the most popular. You obviously didn't read and understand my question. The general consumer base and users we want using Bitcoin are not going to want un-necessary complexities. Stop being so protective, you're not helping Bitcoin!

I don't know what people were expecting, it's going to take a little time before the average consumer feels the affects of the **decreasing supply**.
