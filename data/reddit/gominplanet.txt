Start an LLC in St Kitts and open a bank account there - cash out on island an pay off the banker’s commission.. 2% perhaps.. and move on. Don’t bring the money back home..  ��

I have using credit cards and it still is not showing in my history .. although I did receive my btc in my breadwallet a few hours later.. that was a month and half ago though .. good luck 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:10:40
I bought .3 BTC a month ago in changelly and it worked fine.. it is slow and next time I buy I will be going somewhere else.. coinmama perhaps? Or a bitcoin atm while I’m visiting the US :)

Not a big fan of these guys but their argument was on point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:02:23
I'm off by 600$ by my calculations (on bread wallet as well)
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:10
By Xmas, we will be at over 25K.. correction seems inevitable. 
25K then down 5K.
35K then 10K.
50K then down 15K.
75K then down 25K.
100K then down 50K. 
500K then down 100K.
2M then down 500K.
The tend is rising but with more and more massive correction or dips as it goes up. That's my prediction and I'm sticking to it.. haha
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:36:20
I have the Bitcoin Ticker for Mac on my toolbar at the top and constantly check it.

We’re still waiting for our insurance claim in SXM.. oyster pond got hit pretty bad - good on your dad for fixing it up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:35
This is NUTS!! all morning, just watching the price go UP!
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:15:32
plot holes?? c'mon this is a solid explanation :) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:29:02
You can no longer purchase Bitcoin through the Bread App.. I've been using Changelly instead and it works marvelously albeit still with 7% fees.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:01:32
gold reply!! haha
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:18:28
The USD's trust has been on a steady decline since 2008 - but what about the EURO? Is it just me but I feel like old timer German and Swiss bankers are not too happy with Bitcoin .
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:59:24
man, you nailed right on the head. best comment of the day.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:22:12
also in the past. "I have a bitcoin" = no sex, nerd!
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:40:50
wait a few years :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:57:42
Depends if you need the money... no one here is going to tell you what to do with YOUR money. Everyone has a different threshodl ;)
I'm buying more bitcoins every week regardless of the rising price. I trust the tech and see the bigger picture. I also don't "need" that money to survive.. different threshodl .
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:08:30
thanks.. this is helpful.. I don't need crazy lawyer fees since I live in a Caribbean island with very little taxes and fees for anything ;)
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:57:08
I’m hoping .5 BTC is enough for a comfortable retirement in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:29:47
You can go to Localbitcoin or Paxful and purchase BTC with a Target gift card.. hope that helps. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:44:12
Yep, they have a portal that's managed by Simplex. They require two pieces of ID to verify identity and then just a credit card. The fees are steep (7.9%) but just to get in the game as quickly as possible, worth it! :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:36:46
That's not the correction most people speak of.. a correction would be a dip to 4 or $5,000. By tomorrow morning my ticker will probably read $12,500
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:51:48
Just bought 0.2 yesterday and am planning on buying more this week. Buying fractions is the way to go. HODL is the thing to do once purchased. Not sure how long but I don't see myself selling even if it goes beyond 100K.. hopefully by then I'll have a few coins ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:47:26
World Banks will be shaking in their gold plated boots - if they're not already doing so.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:35:17
Anything is possible :)

We are in the Caribbean so US power supply is fine and we use US currency as well. This is what the company sent to me earlier by email:
"The BTM's are designed to operate as standalone units by default with an internal wallet.   You as the operator would load the machine with BTC and collect the cash on a regular schedule.   The fees charged and transaction sizes are configurable by you."
Sounds like a good investment, no? thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:04:57
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:20:57
What about fees? surely you had to pay taxes and other fees with fiat, right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:53:24
Funny that you have exactly the amount to buy 2 Bitcoins :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:42:20
My Bit in Your Coin
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:28:23
There's a difference between being informed and being told what to do. I know some people that are investing huge right now. I will be purchasing more and more every week until sometime in 2018. Dip, Drop, Bubble or not. I am sticking with it. This is not a get rich quick scheme for me.
As for anyone else, you do you!
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:14:54
Renounce citizenship and buy a st kitts and Nevis passport .. live in paradise and “start” your own bank .. there are over 500 “banks” in some streets and you wouldn’t even know it ����
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:49:23
Pretty sure Canada also has that 51% rule.
Now onto the law:
You CANNOT change the denomination — for example, you cannot add to zeros to a one dollar bill and pretend that it’s a one hundred dollar bill. That’s illegal.
You CANNOT burn, shred, or destroy currency, rendering it unfit for circulation.
You CANNOT advertise a business on paper currency. For example, if you own a Bagel shop, you cannot stamp “Eat at Joe’s Bagel’s” on a dollar.
--- hence you could "advertise" Bitcoins but not your website selling BTC.

I’m betting on 1M happening within the next 10 years.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:26:09
I'm using Bread.. I will be switching over to a ledger fairly soon.. I'm in it for the hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:46:37
brilliant.. haha. Now that's better than a 42 inch tv for 50$ ;)
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:57:11
People that tell you to diversify to protect yourself are not seeing the bigger picture. I'm not "blindly" believing in BTC - but you literally only live once so go for it.
It's a gamble sure, but you'll kick yourself in a few years if you you didn't join and BTC is at 100K or even 1M.
I'm 40 and have plenty of time to recover my investment in BTC whatever happens. I just wish I was 20 with 100K in. LOL
I'm in it for the ride and for the HODL !
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:23:25
Thx, it is somewhat restrictive to purchase BTC in some countries.. i.e. mine. I'm an expat but all of my money and accounts are on this island now so the transactions with bitstamp, gdax and others are impossible. with a population of over 100K, and one BTM, this could be pretty lucrative ;) we shall see.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:59:26
I know nothing of this company, and do not represent them.. I was just looking for an inexpensive way of getting into this service and they seem pretty easy and cheap, no?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:49:43
3 hours after the initial payment and order through Bread app and Simplex, I received the blockchain and the amount appears in my wallet.
This won't be the last purchase!
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:06:28
I just want to be in the 1 BTC club - haha! Just got in this week at 0.12 BTC, slowly buying more
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:38:22
• 9X in 2017
• I'd estimate 18x in 2018 based on the start of mass adoption and CME Futures. 
But really? Who knows.. haha.. this is just an "educated" guess..
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:54:59
I'm using Bread Wallet and confirmation is quick BUT there is not setting for you to customize your fees.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:53:41
It's not Bread that deals with the CC but Simplex.. they are reliable and verify all transactions .. I've used them plenty of times.
When is the app going to show the buying function.?. - I still can't see it.
