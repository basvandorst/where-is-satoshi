OH MY GOD! SOMEONE HURT YOUR FEELINGS?
Here, have a safe space..
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:08:36
for what? :D
If you were first to register twitter handle  then you would be the legitimate owner of that handle!
Dafuq you are smoking to think you can brigade and harass people just because they don't fit to your restricted point of view?

Meanwhile your beloved team hypocritical developer clowns named your scamcoin BitcoinGold and that was OK? :D
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:02:06
Correct - this coin you have here should be called:
-segwit1x coin or S1X
-bitcoin legacy (if you insist on stealing bitcoins name)

And do you also think it is possible to have mass adoption with 1MB blocks? If enough people start using BTC, that 1MB will be clogged forever even if only initial channel funding happens onchain.. no?

u/tabbr 10000000 bits

Can old bitcoin clients spend segwit TXs? The answer is no. So no, Segwit coin is not bitcoin. It is as simple as that.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:08:01
But do you even notice how much damage core devs and their economically retarded decisions have done to BTC???
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:14:20
Yeah, that's why he did not ruin it with adding segwit cancer
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:30:54
Then why was Segwit2x rejected and covered with thin layer of shit from core?
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:14:11
Fuck them in that case - i only support this because THEY HAVE STATED ALL THE TIME THAT 1MB will be 4EVAA!!! 
I want my useless RPi  node to keep running!

The equilibrium will be reached when
Avg TX fee = 1BTC.
After that we hit the moon!

Full blocker is someone who believes in retarded fee market

@_date: 2017-11-28 13:04:37
What else would they call BCore? That's what Maxwell and those other goblins decided to name it right? I hate to see so many people lose money on BCore. I'm glad people who support bitcoin made money off of BCore!

You should not take any trading advice from others - the only way to not have anger/regrets/shill problems is to educate yourself and make your own decisions..

Floyd Mayweather finds that quote funny
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:39:32
Connor was the one that said he can beat Mayweather on any arena rules

So you would most likely have at least 2x as much net worth, if you would have bought at the next dip/steady price after that ATH
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:13:22
This post did not age well...
Just like this tweet:
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:19:52
Never buy ATH - that is just bad investment strategy no matter what.
Also, don't buy the dip - catching a falling knife can hurt.
Buy when the price is stable - when it has been discovered correctly. After that there will be some breakout on uptrends
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:01:51
Until tether has public audit, this is bullshit
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:02:40
Is this also how you measure scams - the more they rake in, the better?
