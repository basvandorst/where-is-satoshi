I used coinbase base to send 100 to Binance last week and paid about $3.77, I did  nothing special to lower fees.   What is dictating fees?

No problem I would like to get into it but not sure how long the miner are good for and they are marked up a ton in price.

Well I'd venture to guess this post is motivated by the uncertainty around the CMEs. Not by the small drop we've seen in the last 24hrs.

What does this fork mean?  Do we need to do anything?

Search you tube lots of good videos on it.  I don't think the s7 mines at that rate.  Also they are not easy to find at that price.  Also the Asic miners have the risk of becoming obsolete. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:34:06
Are they blocking memes? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:04:29
I'm thinking this is more like.
crappy processed foods&gt;shopping outside the aisle&gt; organic, Vegan, non gmo, unicorn milk

So you think the entire crypto market will tank, or just BTC?
