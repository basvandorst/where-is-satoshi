Well to be fair, losing 100k to stupidity is probably sad even when you're a billionaire.
ITT: Bucketloads of lessons learned, truckloads of lessons missed.

Disclaimer: I have no idea what this case is all about, I just stumbled upon the thread on my frontpage.
But about that police bit, honest question: where do you live? As you go southeast from Central Europe and towards the Middle East, the idea of a police agency not answering their phone or e-mails begins to sound not so outlandish. Especially if they have caller-ID (that's a big if at some places) and see that the call is coming from abroad.

Well. Have an upvote for rigorous due diligence. I'd tip you some doge but it's kind-of frowned upon in this sub, so... ^(want some?)

Great. Diversifying is wise.

Hello again,
Virwox transaction went pretty smoothly, got my BTC in around 40 hours. I got lucky with their commission as well, as the rate is up to 337-339 now.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:34:09
I've been going through the same pain in the last few days. In fact, had I seen virwox.com accepted paypal and direct credit card payment two or three days ago, I would have been... around $4-5 richer. Okay, that's not a huge loss :P but still.
Anyway, virwox is pretty easy. You first buy SLL (second life currency) with USD or EUR, then sell them for BTC and withdraw to a wallet. Buying SLL and selling for BTC is instant, but withdrawal isn't for a new account (from what they say). It said "up to 48 hours", but I hope not...
If you decide to go with virwox, be careful that you can only trade with full units - no cents allowed. So if you deposit $x.95 like I did (after paypal commission it became like that), you'll be leaving that .95 in your account. And then you can't withdraw BTC in 0.00x units, withdrawal is allowed down to hundredths. I now have a couple hundred SLL and some cents uselessly sitting in my account and they can only be of use if I buy BTC from them again.

In the meantime, btcturk crashes after a screwup in their rate calculations.

Good luck and stay safe!

Thing is, you can never save up too much for security, so you have to stop at some reasonable point. But there may be times when that reasonable point is not enough and you have to cash out quick, whether at a profit or a loss.

Determining those highs and lows is where the rocket science comes in, especially in a market emerging out of absolute nothingness and where the investors are nothing like the usual (i.e. Internet-dwelling youngsters).

True, as is with Bitcoin itself. But frowned upon by whom exactly?
Also, I doubt they would chicken out simply because one of many payment methods they have isn't approving of their business. From what is listed on their front page, 24h volume in SLL is above $200k. Also, buying BTC from them isn't cheap by any means - I bought 0.06 2-3 hours ago at $340+/BTC when btc-e rate was dancing around 280.
Getting caught in the middle would be a total bad luck brian btw :P I don't know if larger volumes would be like this, but in my transaction, both USD-&gt;SLL and SLL-&gt;BTC trades were done within the second. I did spend a couple minutes between placing the orders but that's just me.

In some countries too. Nothing USA, western European or Scandinavian and you're pretty much set.

Check [here]( for my experience with virvox. I placed a withdrawal order virvox-&gt;btce 2.5 hours ago and I'm waiting for their confirmation. Probably a bit more expensive than localbitcoins, but I'd say infinitely safer (especially for a third world-er like myself).

On the other hand, ***IF*** the 2011-2013 trend continues towards, say, five digits, you might have eaten your most expensive sandwich in 11/2013. Relatively minor point compared to long term benefits of widespread adoption, but one to consider before going on a shopping spree ("for the greater good", best justification ever to buy a new PC :P).

Also, 
this shows you live trades and order depths as well, but has much less technical analysis stuff. I think it's currently having a bit of an overload, but that's very rare.
