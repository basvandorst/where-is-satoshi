So you think Institutional Investors are moving in to buy BTC. Hold it, then when it goes live on the CME they short the price of the coin. Sell off their BTC holdings and make money on the BTC price and their shorts?

Can you elaborate on the opaque block scenerio? I think I understand but not sure. Also the generally sell gh/s at something like .05 per gig. But it fluctuates as you can trade the hash. Cost per gig is super expensive. You won't ever make your investment back if thier cost per share drops to zero. Also if you refer people you get a percentage of thier hash rate. Seems kind of like a sophisticated scam to a degree.

I was thinking something similar yesterday, was going to include it in my other post.
Although you could also use a magnetic stripe credit card thing as well, just develop a app, that interfaces with the bitcoin network. They swipe the card, it's entered in to the bitcoin network and then an amount is transferred. Although now that I say this your "Address" would then become important to hide, unless you created a middle man to verify identity, and created some type of PIN code.

@_date: 2011-06-04 20:13:00
To the question of legality. If this (digital currency) becomes outlawed (because it is a virtual currency that people are buying and selling with legal tender.) Then goes to trial. Could you argue that video game money such as L$, EVE ISK, Credits, WoW Gold are also considered forms of digital/electronic currency and should also be outlawed? Would this then mean that you could also argue that digital US $ electronic transactions would be illegal too? Of course it all boils down to how the law is constructed in the first place, but just me thinking out loud.

@_date: 2011-06-15 13:22:18
The only thing that I would be interested in buying right now is a reprap, and at the current price of BTC it isn't doable for me. I'd also like to start up a small business website but again that takes funds which I don't have and BTC payouts are not really enough to cover that from mining so... the whole bitcoin network should have been a pool and handed out trickles of payments in my opinion rather than "oh you won" here's 50btc. But that's a whole other topic.

You state you're putting the private key in someone else's server with no context. So as far as I can tell you're talking about my bitcoin private key/wallet.dat. 
Original purpose of bitcoin is to use it as an internet currency not a meatspace currency. However, to gain wide spread usage I've also had the same idea/similar idea. However you should refine it. You should not centralize this service. 
Edit: Clearifying.

@_date: 2011-05-23 16:50:10
I did have a thought, and I'm sure someone could develop it to mask activities like this (so as not to get raided). But the idea is some type of device (I'm guessing it would have to be backed up by a battery bank) to vary your load considerably throughout the day. Spiking at random times throughout the day. Then running off the battery bank for a little while until it was time to charge them again from the grid. If that makes sense.
Edit: accidentally a letter.

If Bitcoin is backed by CPU work, and there is a finite supply, how is bitcoin subject to inflation? Conversely if it is not subject to inflation, then how is it subject to deflation? Unless you're talking about it's exchange rate. 
@_date: 2011-05-26 15:17:18

@_date: 2011-10-20 12:33:19
Why would I want to do this?
@_date: 2011-05-31 19:05:17
You should go into ATI Catalyst Controls, where it gives you the temp, and  fan and change it to manual. Set your fan to 50% and hopefully it will cool it down. Mine had been running upwards of 90 degrees C after I did this (and after many years of gaming) I set it to manual 50% fan and am now down to about 50 degrees at idle and 80 degrees when running. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 19:45:08
I suspect, that if they're trying to legitimize bitcoin the large players in the market will need to dump a lot to drive down the cost of purchasing bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-04-10 19:10:19
damn it I didn't haha..

Aye it's quite good and when you watch that and you then realize that fractional reserve banking just won't work. 
I submitted it here for everyone to view, but not sure if it's caught in spam filter

This is why I haven't used coinbase in a long time and moved to campbx. Spend-X FTW.
@_date: 2013-07-09 02:03:31
Ok thanks I didn't realize that!
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:40:16
Or half a bitcoin :D
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:45:12
If this was a scam involving non-digital currency (usd for example) wouldn't this get shut down by reddit admins? 
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:28:10
Looks like campbx is having some issues, probably because of this or trading volume? 
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:39:54
Why is there a watermark of a camel? Is that the logo for Silkroad? I've never been to it so wouldn't know.

buying BTC with an ach transfer. I'm Dollar cost averaging BTC to mitigate risk. But doing small amounts at the moment. $10 worth, which was fine the first two transactions, but now it has hit their .1 BTC limit.
@_date: 2013-08-19 22:24:42
Yea I did that and looks like $20 is the number. What's the diff between a swift transfer and an Aba transfer?
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:15:04
They just made their own 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:49:44
Someone needs to decetralize the exchanges. Perhapa publish some open source code. Either that or break appart the exchange and the charts. What I mean by that is aggrigate and average the prices at the various exchanges as much as possible to get a better avg price per btc
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:11:16
Yay bitcoin is on sale!
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:27:37
I like the term nerd dubloons
@_date: 2013-06-28 17:44:16
Why does the location name remind me of Brentonwoods....I am sure this is just coincidental. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 22:25:04
After seeing he was also with VISA, I kind of have to agree... 
Edit: Oh gosh he's also behind coinlab. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:43:29
Ah ok that makes sense then.
@_date: 2013-07-08 11:54:25
can you clarify what your stating having trouble understanding it.
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:19:52
QE is separate from what banks normally do when they're giving out loans. 
This is a pretty good video that explains fractional reserve banking. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:16:42
I do like the conviniance of coinbase and transfer of money from my account.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:04:30
Just created this, I was feeling the same way the other day.
@_date: 2013-04-20 13:23:59
I'm not sure exactly I just find the whole email odd, and especially since it didn't let me complete the sign up process. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:42:19
Yep I agree, they definitely need to find some more talented developers. I heard they finally have a support person. I'd volunteer my time if I could do so remotely.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:07:48
Yes it is unfortunately for those that live in other countries.

Reposted so you don't have to visit it: 
The Bitcoin trading platform Mt. Gox in Tuwsday was issued a warrant that stopped its ability to send or accept transfers of the electronic currency through its Dwolla payment service.
Betabeat reported that the Department of Homeland Security issued a “seizure warrant” for the Dwolla account, and a copy of the warrant obtained by Ars Technica revealed it was for “unlicensed money transmitting.”
The warrant, in part, states:
    (a) Whoever knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business, shall be fined in accordance with this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.
    (b) As used in this section—
    (1) the term “unlicensed money transmitting business” means a money transmitting business which affects interstate or foreign commerce in any manner or degree…
The warrant identifies Mark Karpeles, the president and CEO of Mt. Gox, as opening a Wells Fargo bank account in May 2011 under Mt. Gox’s subsidiary company Mutum Sigillum. The application for the account, the warrant states, explicitly asked if the company exchanges currency for customers and if it “[accepts] funds from customers or [sends] the funds based on customer instructions (Money Transmitter)?”
To both of these, Karpeles answered no.
If Mt. Gox or Mutum Sigillum were transmitting money, it would need to be registered with FinCen, and neither are, according to the records mentioned in the warrant.
The warrant goes on to show how a “confidential informant” was able to reveal that the company was “engaged in a money transmitting business but is not registered with FinCen.”
Through the Dwolla account, the feds established that it has probable caused to believe Mt. Gox or Mutum Sigillum were violating 18 U.S.C. section 1960. Due to this, the Wells Fargo account and the Dwolla account, which was held through Veridian Credit Union, were subject to seizure.
This is the latest statement Mt. Gox issued on its Facebook profile, which was nearly 24 hours ago:
    Like many who have contacted us, MtGox has read on the Internet that the United States Department of Homeland Security had a court order and/or warrant issued from the United States District Court in Maryland which it served upon the Dwolla mobile payment service with respect to accounts used for trading with MtGox. We take this information seriously. However, as of this time we have not been provided with a copy of the court order and/or warrant, and do not know its scope and/or the reasons for its issuance. MtGox is investigating and will provide further reports when additional information becomes known.
This news comes after bitcoin saw a rapid rise in its value within the last couple months.  The currency did go through a bit of a “bitcrash” but was still significantly higher than it had been before.

Did coinbase reverse your transactions?
@_date: 2013-08-23 11:53:58
You may have run into the regulations that anything over $1000 in a day requires you to send in documents. Like with mtgox you have to do the same with dollar due to financial rules.
@_date: 2013-07-08 22:20:30
I have a question here, what role does the Bitcoin Foundation play in the bitcoin eco-system? Do they make policy about the client/system and how it functions? 
Taking this to an extreme thought but say 10-20 years from now what is stopping this group from being something similar to a federal reserve in terms of policy controls etc?
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:27:46
Thanks I will give these a try.
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:50:56
I also like to use keepass to generate passwords for me. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 11:51:12
Same thought here
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:27:31
Awesome that is very helpful!
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:47:58
This is stupid, everyone's coins will be on a redlist at some point or another.
Edit: As a further thought, can we also adapt the bitcoin platform/code to create some type of community voting system? That way when clowns like this get put into  a position in the foundation we can collectively vote them out/in?
@_date: 2013-09-27 17:04:12
Why not call it YABW.... 
how many wallets do you actually need?
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:46:42
Yep I do, and I use a password that has 95 bit password.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:05:03
Thanks! I was wondering what was happening.
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:35:18
You actually only need to watch the first 12 minutes to realize that fractional reserve banking is impossible with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:13:45
Bitcoin is on sale... the lower the better :D

Not so bad, I bought about two btc for the price of one. If yo cost average your purchases and purchase the same dollar amount. I did a video on it and would gladly pm it to you if interested.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:36:08
You might find this video I did interesting... 
Basically me unboxing the thing but then I do the math on how much it cost me assuming I got it on time.
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:54:05
I love campbx, I had to move to them to do bitcoin cost averaging since coinbase wouldn't let me do sub .01 btc.
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:26:28
They only have 2 people that work for them at the moment they desperately need people to help them. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 03:26:57
If enough people do this I imagine BFL's paypal account will get locked.
