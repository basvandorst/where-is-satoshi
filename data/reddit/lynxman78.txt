I wanted him to explain a ponzi scheme to me because he thinks Bitcoin is one.

r/Bitcoin and r/Bitcoincash are livable for supporters of either. r/Btc is torture.

Almost 10% is not bad in my opinoin. To make huge money from day trading you probably need to trade huge amounts in the first place. ;)

Buy goods with it, or exchange it for a different cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:10:40
Is that a joke?
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:31:11
I think segwit adoption will explode once the popular wallets and exchanges actually deploy it. Most are working on it, so it's hard for users to adopt Segwit at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:14:14
It's common in my country to have one month interest free credit so as long as the bill is paid in full within one month you don't lose money on the credit card loan.
I use this for safer internet shopping and always pay back the full amount in time.
Obviously the banks want people to not pay in full, and also this probably causes people to spend more than they have.

Written by some conspiracy theorist who seems to think money has intrinsic value, and shared by you because of confirmation bias.
Give a short explanation in your own words of why Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:50:08
Weird logic.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:57:49
The lowest fee I can set when sending from my Bech32 Segwit wallet in Electrum is 142 sat/byte. What's up with that?
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:45:54
If it was broken then it would go offline. It's stretched closer to the limit. It's still operating despite extreme spam and an explosion of adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:18:47
Online wallet providers and exchanges need to make the change.

Why would you want Bitcoin to die?

Segwit adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:49:55
What about that makes it "undependable"?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:48:55
Weird how BCH stays a constant 2500 while the trading volume is high.

Where are you seeing $14k? 
I like to follow the prices here:

BTC has risen almost $1500 since yesterday.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:17:02
Ok. Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:05:21
Yes. Hopefully Lightning is integrated as an easy to use option in the user interface of wallets and exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:59:22
I bought my bitcoins through localbitcoins.com
Happened immediately.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:38:25
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:48:02
Yup. I saved a lot of money in the bank, because when I got over a certain amount the interest increased. I still lost buying power over time.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:51:40
It's coming. It takes time to deploy safely, I guess. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:53:47
I've never even heard of Stripe before. Guess they don't matter in my part of the world.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:04:42
You can pay $15 or even more if you want to. You can also pay a minimum fee if you're willing to wait. Even today the minimum (normal) fee I have to pay to move a small amount from my non segwit wallet is less than your projected $15. 
People moving huge amounts will pay more. The average will be high. This is why propaganda bragging about low averages isn't necessarily that impressive. Especially for a currency in its infancy.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:54:21
Their minimum fee is $6.57 for me if I try to send. 
They are going to introduce segwit wallets very soon.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:57:35
I just panic held all mine.

It's "Martin Luther King Jr. day", or something. That probably slows things down.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:14:51
I bought in at a high price too. I'm not worried.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:52:42
The fact that they use a channel called BTC should ring some bells in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:27:54
Miners will sell their GPUs because they are upgrading to newer more profitable GPUs, not because mining isn't possible any more. Therefore manufacturers will still sell a shitload to the same miners. Hopefully they can predict the demand better in the future.

One of the current event tracks in the mobile game "Hill Climb Racing 2" is called "Coins To The Moon".

The "normal" fee when sending BTC from Blockchain is now $0,28 (11 sat). Priority fee is $5,67 (222 sat).

@_date: 2018-01-16 14:06:46
If Bitcoin is dead, how would you describe the altcoins?
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:47:30
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:37:41
1. They have not solved scaling, but pretend like they have the solution. They have larger blocks, but that just delays the problem, and bigger blocks will take longer to mine.
2. They use the domain bitcom.c0m to confuse newcomers to think it's Bitcoin. 
3. They call BCH "the real Bitcoin". Which also confuses newcomers.
4. They even copied the Bitcoin logo.
5. r/BTC is a toxic sub that looks like it contains info about Bitcoin, but it's filled to the brim with BCH fanboys.
I have both BTC and BCH, btw. I don't think BCH is going away.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:15:49
Hopefully people will rush to get out of BCH. BCH is down 15,4% while BTC is down 10% today.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:28:23
No, but BTC is gonna go up again.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:57:24
Localbitcoins.com is a good place to buy. They also have segwit wallets so transfer from their internal wallet is cheap and fast.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:56:29
How can the BCH guys keep doing shit like this without consequences? I can't believe BCH supporters actually defend this shit.

I think this a good point.

r/BTC shouldn't be allowed to continue. It's a misleading sub.

I figured it out. I unchecked "Use dynamic fees" in the preferences. Now I can set it to whatever I like.

I haven't overextended, but it's still not fun to (potentially) lose it. I wish I had gotten in earlier though so that the value wasn't just hovering right under what I paid. That would be more fun. :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:01:30
I suggest you sell everything now then.

@_date: 2018-01-16 18:14:19
Who are these people who lose so much money? Bitcoin has increased in value several hundrer percent every year the past few years.
The death of bitcoin is only a benefit to bailout bankers. The only way lots of people lose money is if it dies. What kind of sick fuck would want that?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:30:04
Or more likely, in my opinion, rising another 10%.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:07:18
Good point.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:53:53
I wonder where you came from. /s
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:29:32
Alle the alternatives to Bitcoin are infant currencies by comparison. 
You can pretend like Bitcoin isn't being developed and improved over time, but you know that's wrong. 
I agree that fees right now are higher than they should be, but it's obvious that this is temporary. They are also not quite as high as the propaganda wants you to believe. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:36:20
Yeah, just saying how it works for those who don't kow. :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:41:46

@_date: 2018-01-09 15:59:59
Fees are too high right now. That is a temporary problem. That doesn't make it undependable.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:22:34
He sais Bitcoin is about to crash, and we should all get out as soon as possible.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:45:36
He also posted about it on Facebook in early december. The post's deleted now off course. If I see more schemes like that being pushed on FB I'm going to get angry. 
Today I started getting annoyed for the sake of all the people who lost money because of those guys. It's incredible how big this is. I confronted him about the collapse a few days ago and he says he made more than his investment a long time ago so it doesn't matter to him.

@_date: 2018-01-16 13:55:25
I think it needs to be 51%. Wouldn't they need to rewrite the entire blockchain for that to work? If it's not done quickly enough it will be discarded by other miners.

Great way to get rich quick or lose everything trying.

Here you can see which exchanges and wallets use Segwit, and which will deploy segwit soon:
Segwit2x doesn't exist.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:07:46
That's what I think. The graph when looking close up looks very odd. It's going up and down the exct same amount constantly all day every day. Someone is desperately trying to keep it high up in the trading volume list.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:57:42
Average is not the same as minimum. You can pay what you want. Segwit is not the end of Bitcoin development.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:30:35
The "low" price at the end of the year is going to make the growth in 2018 look even biger. ;)

They are misrepresenting Bitcoin. This is obvious. Being technically correctly worded to mislead does not make it correct og ethical. It's the same thing as when they announced that "the founders of bitcoin.c0m are abandoning bitcoin". People will think the actual founders of bitcoin are abandoning Bitcoin, even though Bitcoin.c0m has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

I think they should move to arctic regions and use the heat to heat towns. A mining farm on Svalbard with heat exchangers to heat the building in the town would be awesome.
A local iron smelting plant here (arctic) collects waste heat and distributes it all around the local city by water.

How I got into Bitcoin: In november a childhood friend of mine contacted me to me to tell me about this fantastic opportunity called Bitconnect, and how he had made ridiculous amounts of money. He wanted me to join ,using his affiliate off course. I did my own research and realized it was probably a pyramid scheme and turned him down. While researching it I also learned more about Bitcoin. I calculated that he would have earned more if he had just kept his Bitcoin instead of "investing". I bought a bunch of Bitcoin instead.
I felt pretty smart about my decision a few days ago.

Another site deployed Segwit now. Not sure which one, but the deployed number was 18 yesterday:

Dumb comparison, but just like black people taking the word n... as their own and using it themselves, the BCH guys shoudl start doing the same to the word BCash, instead of raging about it on youtube and here. That would benefit BCH greatly.

Because having money in the bank will only devalue it. If I "save" my money in the bank I will be able to buy less with it after a while than if I had spent it when I deposited it.

Individual users are not to blame for the failed adoption of Lightning (or Segwit). If improvements are to work they need to happen when people go about their usual cryptocurrency business. 
There's this weird idea going about that it's up to users to take advantage of it or change to services that utilize the new feature, but that's a really bad sign. The improvements have to come easy to users, or it is doomed to fail.

I expect nothing significant to happen until the new year is upon us, and even then at least a few days into it. The current back and forth is nothing to worry about, imo, unless you want to take advantage and buy.
I'm not an expert.

Looking at the average over a few days, it looks to me  like the dip is no longer getting steeper, but is leveling out slowly.

My dream car would be a Ford GT40 replica. First I have to afford a garage to keep it in. Lambos must be a pain in the posterior region to own, not to mention the wallet. Buying a modern supercar is only a small part of the cost.

The dip today looks almost exactly like the dip this morning. There's a pattern:

I think it will go down in a few hours too, but not as much as before. I believe it's leveling off, looking at the charts.

You don't lose unless you cash out when it's low. You didn't buy just to cash out today did you? No, so hold it for however you originally intended to hold it.

I should have too, but it feels too close to gambling in my case. Can't safely invest more than I already have.
On the other hand, maybe one should only keep as much as one can loose in fiat, and invest the rest in crypto. :P lol

That was exciting to follow for a newcomer to bitcoin. I took advantage of the dip to buy some extra fractions of BTC.

Looking at it very short tern there's a downtrend. Looking at the trend over the last week there's an sawtooth shaped trend that is going up on average. The bottoms that happen every few days are higher and higher up for each drop.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:29:30
This is true. When I started to get in I was confused when I saw Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Both even have the same logo. BCH fanboys will tell me I'm too stupid to invest if I was confused by that, but everyone had to start figuring stuff out some time.
I only bought Bitcoin though, but I had to go look up and read up on the controversy before I figured out what was going on.
I have a little of both now.
Would have been much easier if they would just use Bcash or Bitcash, but the confusion is probably by design:

Could be, but probably won't. And if it does, it's not like it's the end. It'll bounce off whaterver the bottom is. Why be negative?

Ok. I'm trying to figure out what's happening too. We don't all have to be pessimistic about it.

I don't really think Coinbase would post this if it was a lie, but if VISA caused this disaster and only apologised to Coinbase behind the scenes then that's a disgrace. They should make it public.

Did you just lick your finger and point it up in the air to come to that conclusion?
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:18:05
Where did I say I know where it will go? I specifally said "uncharted territory". I'm quite pragmatic about the charts.
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:05:26
It would be useful if you posted where it says that. I found it:

r/Bitcoin three years from now:

What is the mechanism that automatically drives up the altcoin prices when bitcoin is being pumped? It's ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:43:31
Noone would mine if it wasn't profitable.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:20:26
So, 11:40 more time for it to go up.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:22:00
The price broke through the downward trend that Bitcoin has been bouncing off every time. Uncharted territory now.

No, I won't buy any more. I'm holding. I'm just saying what I think will happen.
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:45:14
The same people use a lot of exchanges, so you have the same person owning accounts at Coinbase, Binance and many other. It's not ten different people just because there are ten different accounts around the world.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:04:02
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:27:13
Not even close.
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:32:31
Maybe not 5k4, but I guess it'll drop a little below the current level again when it reaches 10-11k as the opportunists sell off what they bought when it was lower.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:06:17
In my uneducated opinion there's most likely a huge bull flag happening now.

The average Joe won't need to know how Bitcoin works when it's ready for the public, just like his credit cards today.

Arrogant asshole.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:14:35
Make your point but don't be an arrogant asshole. You're not exactly encouraging discussion the way you're responding.
The reason the trend line matters is not because I think it's special,  I don't think there's something inherently special about it, but the same reason that the price bounces off it over and over again. It's where the sell off starts over and over again.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:21:42
They were encouraged to sell by other formercoiners. They breed like rabbits.

The time it takes to wire money from banks has nothing to do with Bitcoin transaction delays. Bitcoin transactions will go through in minutes now, or half an hour at very low fees.
If you need it quickly you can buy somewhere that lets you use a credit/debit card or paypal, and transfer the Bitcoin to Kraken.
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:59:04
Which year?

The dollar is dropping. Everybody get out. It was 8,4 NOK per USD a month ago. Now it's 7,65 NOK. REKT

They could reduce the energy cost of bitcoin mining by establishing mining farms in areas of the planet that need heating most of the year. The heat from the miners can be distributed to the surrounding community via water pipes. 
A local smelting plant does just that. The excess heat is used to keep the whole town warm.

Bitcoin is now at the disastrous low point it hit for a moment before the new year.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:31:07
7600 is not a sure sign of recovery in my opinion. I think the recovery pump will start off very strong when it hits bottom.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:48:59
$10000 is going to be such a relief (again). It's weird how that works.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:12:10
People, it's not going to go up in a straight line, it will go up in stair steps, with periods of going down. If you get emotional about the small movement and occasional dips then you're not doing yourself any favors, especially if you want to trade or invest. Just accept that it will move around.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:41:50
Some price information sites seem to reset their percentage at a certain hour, so the shown gain or loss is what has happened since that time.  reset theirs about 40 minutes ago. I watched it happen.

Self fulfilling fud is. FUD about how it crashes, designed to make people panic, so that it will crash.
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:59:25
You should have kept a few Satoshi just to be able to brag about your huge percentage gains when it goes up. :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:47:05
Also, instead of spamming, Coinbase will be batching transactions. If not now, at least soon.
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:58:32
Where was this statement made? This is a link to Coinbase's blog.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:44:00
I don't think anyone thinks it will go up for ever.
It is still early days, because mass adoption hasn't happened yet. That will probably bring up the price if it happens.
Nothing is guaranteed with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:52:42
I think you triggered the bulls.

Segwit transaction percentage seems to be rising steadily now. Over 22%.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:22:16
Dunno. I watch the total volume instead of independend exchanges. Volume is up a lot today:
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:14:13
I bought my first fraction at ~15k . Dumb money is what it's called!
Then I bought more as it dropped, my lowest at 8,3k. I think my average is at about 12k. I plan to hold most of it for a long time, so I'm not worried at all.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:39:02
Here you can see how long it will take with how many satoshis per byte: 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:42:54
Cool. The Segwit transaction percentage wil go up quite a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:15:05
Surprised to see the price when I woke up today. On the other hand, maybe Eth will surpass the price of Bcash soon. BCash dropping harder than Bitcoin kind of makes up for it. :)
Ether: 1107
Bcash: 1335

Meanwhile: "Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value established as money, often by government regulation."
@_date: 2018-02-17 06:51:35
It's weird when the difference is explained as "Bitcoin is digital money that you can't touch"
I rarely touch my fiat money. I get what I earn transferred to my acount every month, and I spend it digitally. It's numbers on the internet to me either way.

I'm not a fan of Coinbase, they have problems and have behaved badly, but I don't think they're stupid enough to post this if it's a lie. It looks like VISA is apologising to Coinbase behind the scenes, without taking public responsibility, which is nuts.

I'm staring at the chart as hard as I can.

I have a feeling they won't seem that moronic in a year... unless they panic sold during the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:16:57
I'm pretty sure everyone here knows that. You seemed to think money had intrinsic value though.

Nah, it won't happen with today's dollar value, but it can achieve 1 million in future dollars if they become next to worthless.

I mine altcoins during the winter. I live far north where temperatures are low and my house needs heat to stay comfortable almost all year. It's -21°C outside right now.
I don't plan to mine during the hottest summer months, and will probably sell some of my GPUs this summer, but may start again in the fall.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:36:02
Noone knows. It's a risk. If you sell now you are at a profit. If the price goes down, wait and buy back in at a lower price. If it goes up again instead buy back in as soon as possible to minimize your losses. It's impossible to tell because the price can move either way despite expert technical analasys because it's (people are) so sensitive to many things.

Let's see what happens. I think it'll bounce off 10k and climb again.

Most non segwit exchanges don't support Bech32 SegWit addresses (yet). I had to transfer to a non segwit Electrum wallet and then to my SegWit Wallet. Fees are low so it wasn't a problem for me other than a hassle.

I bet you'll be smiling in a few days/weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:52:35
It probably won't hit 5-6k on the next big dip. It will most likely just cross whatever the next 200 day average trend line sits at, maybe 15k.

I'll answer my take on the first point 
- Hard to use it as a currency when it's not adopted by the shops. I try to use it as a currency every time I buy or sell used stuff. I also see it as an investment currently. I think it's an incredible investment opportunity.

200 Simple Moving Average is a low trend line based on the previous 40 weeks. It means the bottom is being tested again. It bounced off the 200 SMA every time it was hit before, I believe. Last time in 2015.

I think he's kind of crazy but I also think he's pretty damn smart.

It never looks like a "safe investment" when the best buying opportunities come up.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:25:14
Well, do better than just calling me delusional.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:20:16

I'm looking forward to the day when I do that.

How's it hangin'?

I like those odds.

Once it hits 40k it'll drop like a stone. Once it hits 60k it'll drop like a stone.

On what? Rick Falkvinge says people should "spend and replace", but that's pointless unless you're a day trader.

The weekend was over hours ago here. East Asia is buying.

Bitcoin doesn't need to be high priced to be useful. It needs to be adopted, and with adoption comes a higher price.
@_date: 2018-03-17 07:14:50
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:40:29
I'm looking. What are you on about?
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:37:50
"BTC" has never attacked BCH.
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:33:06
You really should read it.
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:03:36
It's bouncing off 9 k now, chewing away at sell orders.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:31:22
I think it'll recover too. It's not like cryptocurrencies are going to die now. I believe they are the future and will only die when replaced by something better... or something.

That only makes sense if the fork will produce two coins of value. The old coin will be abandoned. Are they betting that there will be two working strains after the fork?
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:34:42
I'm panic hodling.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:32:31
Putin's Russia is very much a propaganda machine. They probably lie and manipulate more than they tell the truth. Putin is educated as a professional liar.

The dollar is fueling America's gun crisis.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:40:48
Better sell then.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:45:53
This one is better:

No exchange or wallet provider has deployed Segwit support in several weeks. Coinbase tried but failed. WTF?
Still at 22 deployed: 
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:12:40
You mean the subreddit called BTC? It's fucking backwards.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:08:31
17 no's and one yes equals yes.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:19:20
Have they implemented it yet? It's been over two months since they were supposed to start doing it.
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:40:09
Explain that one.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:52:10


This gets repeated here like past performance is never indicative of future returns. When you look at Bitcoin up until now it's bloody likely.
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:42:05
Sell: NOW Buy: 1 
My tip is much better.
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:28:28
Don't worry. I'm staring at the price as hard as I can so there's no way it's going down now.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:24:20
I saw that and disagree. Your definition of nearly is very broad. 700 is closer to half of 1000 than it is to 1000.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:42:02
Can't believe you just wrote that.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:00:53
Autists are likely to be more pragmatic about it.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:24:59
I stand corrected. They still don't show up in the Segwit list: 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:30:07
I left my computer at 8300 and forgot to tether up. Still waiting. :P
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:00:06


Doesn't make sense. HODLers didn't hold to realize at this moment, so why are they fucked? HODLers don'tgive a damn about the current price.
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:55:13
Maybe this is Ver's latest strategy.

I hope he has a spotted dick, for his sake.

I only bothered to get verified for tier 2, as it's all I need. It took moments, I think. I didn't have any problems when I did it.

Kraken lets you trade those and many more for USD.

Waiting for the dip is futile. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:38:21
How many times have you predicted an imminent drop to 6k in the past few weeks?
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:00:06
Nice straw man.
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:02:38
No tits and or asses involved.

The Bcash guys got back the Bitcoin twitter account. Weird.

Once we breach the 8391,23 barrier we might be heading for 8461,78.

I think I'll create a BCH fork with 33 MB and steal the show.

Crabs walk sideways.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:16:32
Actually about $700 down at its lowest. a little over 600 now.

Not everything is about USA. Look up Iranian economics.
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:41:50
I bought the dip at 16k.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:09:36
Iran is next.
