But the ball still deflates, and banks can just keep on making more balls. Screw the banks! cheers

Why are you putting your balls under the mattress? And what if the world is only starting to figure out that the new fancy ones are usable but not just for buying and selling goods. And what if i told you that you could trade your new balls for old balls (visa versa)

No one said anything about tax evasion it’s just a platform that allows ALL South Africans of all diversities to generate an income which is not subject to what our country calls “fair” discrimination based on race and past discrimination. 
It’s also helpful to the born free generation who are affected due to apartheid. A lot of young white students are struggling to get a job after university and this helps because it’s a source of income available to all regardless of color.
If the state adopted bitcoin it would help with transparency and accountability that’s the great thing.
Bitcoin as a whole is extremely beneficial as it gives us all opportunities that we may not be able to have in our country.
I think it’s very easy to comment on these topics as a non South African but as a South African living in this country it’s a very sensitive issue. We need to be sympathetic to the past discrepancies but we also need to be careful as a nation  not to limit the new generations too much who had nothing to do with apartheid because they are the future of our country and if we carry on the way we are we will never be able to address the issues.
Bitcoin is a platform for all, it doesn’t discriminate and  therefore tax wouldn’t be an issue because at least we all have an equal opportunity at revenue

The governments existence is connected to the banks within south Africa, thus if one is not investing or utilizing south African banks it means an adverse affect for the country economy. If white south Africans invest in bitcoin they are taking money away from the state and thus they are not investing their money in south African revenue which directly affects the economy and thus decisions made by the government. which is beneficial to whites due to the situation of land expropriation without pay because if white south Africans ever need to flee the country they can do so without their money being caught up in the banks. furthermore today all our money from taxes go to the government which support their corrupt decisions and standards and right now bitcoin is not regulated so this puts everyone on an equal playing field without discrimination based on race giving individuals like white south Africans who are getting removed from positions (like older white men) to make room for black south Africans another source of revenue.
Bitcoin gives all individuals equal opportunities where the government take away these opportunities and justify it as "correcting the past", there are so many "born frees" who were not apart of apartheid but are negatively affected by the decisions of these corrupt and one track minded government officials.
Therefore one can fight a government with currency because if less people are supporting the economy thus "funding the government"  then the government will have to take a hard look at the decisions its making. look at Zimbabwe for example there was land expropriation all the whites were removed and none of the blacks could provide food and the economy took a huge knock. Now the blacks are inviting white farmers back to their land and trying to restore the economy to what it once was, corrupt officials are being removed and they are noticing the errors in thier ways.
Therefore bitcoin will help as the governments are directly dependent on a thriving economy or they cant make decisions or use state funding which will caused them to be thrown out and thus it is the perfect tool as south African revenue will not be contributing to the economy so there more individuals that use bitcoin the better the chances of corrupt government officials having to realize that their decisions have consequences and they cant just make decisions based on their feeling of past discrepancies.
PS. Crypto gives people the power to take control of their own future and insure that their money and there future are stable and certain where the government makes all white south Africans feel like their lives are in a ticking time bomb (look at malema 2 weeks ago he said whites should be glad hes not calling for a genocide yet.) therefore bitcoin helps us fight the government by giving us alternative revenues which don't fund a corrupt state
