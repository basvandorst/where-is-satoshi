Can't WAIT for this phone to suddenly crap out on me!

Phew, I thought it was that shitty ness is sans channel.

Give it to her anyways. As Ocon said, if you won't give it to her, her life truly is not worth much in your eyes. I'm betting both of you are unhealthy, so you'd (literally) waste each other away.

Just let me probe your asshole, man.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:41:45
It's pretty damn obvious, man.
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:57:46
Well, what do you have to lose...?
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:24:36
Honestly, It's ambiguous at this point.

That sounds amazing!

Don't like it. Anyone but HTC, the problems I've had with their phones hardware have been fucking astronomical.
Call me when Google/Samsung or the other big boys are in it.

Invested at 8,250, felt like shit when it dropped but then I had a realization that this was for the long term, and I'm certainly not going to stop buying bitcoins. So it's not so bad, at least not compared to the people who invested during the 20k+ peak.
Hang in there newcoiners.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:40:54
I KNOW right? I invested 2,000 dollars when bitcoin was worth 8,2500 and now it dipped to 7,877, no wait, 7,899, no errr, 8,001, duhhhhh, 7,850.
You know how much I lost, 100$ WHOLE BUCKS, UGH, and I haven't even cashed out yet! This is such a pyramid scheme! I thought I was supposed to be insta-rich the next day! It's not like the people who've hit it big have been long time hodlers or anything, they do this on purpose!! /ss

OY VEY! DELETE THIS NOW GOY!
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:21:44
I got chills.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:46:01
For fucks sake. If you're a newcoiner like I am, don't panic sell and hope it drops harder so you can recoup your losses, it's honestly not worth it because the market is so damn unpredictable. 
I lost a good $40 bucks that way. I took that as a warning.

He's probably involved in the company or something, would be super pathetic if he did it for free.

@_date: 2018-02-15 17:35:21
Nice. I should have bought at 8K though, my dumbass waited for it to lower even more, still, 9.5k isn't the worst, though I could have done better.
You can't take the beast folks. Always trust your gut.

Thank you! It's true, reddit is a jack of all trades, master of none.

Very good video nonetheless, regardless of being a theory, it doesn't automatically make it bunk! Thank you for showing me this.

"They simply report the facts - which adhere to my bias"
I wouldn't mind as much if they shot from all angles, but alas, we're in a mad dog race between both sides and all we have to show for it is corporate adoration.
