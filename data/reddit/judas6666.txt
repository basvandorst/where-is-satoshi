Transaction volume is a useless statistic when it comes to the success of Bitcoin. During the last spam attack there were hundreds of thousands of transactions however only a fraction of them could be considered real transactions separate from the spam. Even if you look at the transactions that are occurring today it still appears that the vast majority are either onchain gambling or spam reconsolidation. 
I would argue that Bitcoin days destroyed is a more useful statistic.

A tragic day for bitcoin as a payment network.

Just pay a high enough fee and you'll be fine

A lot of people misunderstand this business and assume that it's way easier than it is.

You would think that something like this would precipitate a financial collapse. Imagine a scenario where RBC charges you a fee to store your funds in a savings account. Seeing as you're losing money by leaving your money there, you simply withdraw it and place it in a safety deposit box or under your mattress at home. If a few people do this no big deal. However if a large chunk of the population decides to do this, we could end up with a Greek type situation.

You're going to find it incredibly difficult due to the fact that credit card transfers can be reversed very easily. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:56:32
You have "all" of your bitcoins there?
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:21:58
2014 and 2015 have been awful for bitcoin. Perhaps 2016 well be better. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 12:34:05
Coinwallet.EU cash in mail is the easiest and doesn't require verification. 
Local bitcoins is also good. Circle of you're in the US. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:57:42
As far as I'm concerned Satoshi is long gone. Until his original bitcoins move, I won't believe anyone who claims to be Satoshi.

If you've been holding bitcoin over the last year, especially in Canada, youve probably doubled your money. 
For anyone looking to get into Canada, I recommend:
Local bitcoins
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:07:11
None. What you're asking for is akin to you asking an anonymous stranger to take a check in exchange for cash and then them hoping it doesn't bounce. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 20:42:08
Quadrigacx works well for this

Classic blockchain.info...always down
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:16:04
You're kidding right? I really hope you don't actually believe that they're sponsored by citi.

Little quick to jump to conclusions with this...
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:38:22
Not really surprising. They stole about $3000 from me. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 03:20:39
Local bitcoins are probably your best bet. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 16:25:02
That's going to be a bit of a challenge. My recommendation would be to find a Wallet that allows you to export all of the transactions as an excel file and then copy and paste the transaction ids from that. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:20:45
Any concerns about credit card fraud when it comes to this?

One of the many signs of a failing digital currency.

Royal definitely is not pro bitcoin and had internal memos such that if your run a business that deals in bitcoin, your account will be closed.

I would say that the biggest reason people use local bitcoins is the fact that you can get paid or pay with pretty much any possible payment system. For example you can buy and sell using PayPal despite the fact not a single exchange would be willing to touch PayPal with a ten foot pole. The same is true for various other national payment systems. Of course the tradeoff for this flexibility is typically higher fees and in some cases the risk of getting ripped off. With that said if you only trade with users that have high positive feedback you'll usually be fine. Just remember that if it looks too good to be true it probably is such as the users on local bitcoins offering 100% bonus if you take their PayPal.

Coinbase is without a doubt the most intrusive and invasive Bitcoin company out there. Unless you were just buying small amounts here and there prepare to have your account frozen without warning.

Exciting to hear. This could have higher implications on bitcoin privacy if it comes to fruition. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:02:15
And that's why most stores don't take checks...
@_date: 2016-01-09 15:11:38
As would cash...
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:09:16
Legally no.

Coinbase likes to block transfers from competitors. If you contact support they'll likely freeze your account.

Drug dealers and backpage hookers mainly.

Sad. Coinbase is designed to ruin the key benefits of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 00:35:14
You should remove coinbase... It's not a Wallet
