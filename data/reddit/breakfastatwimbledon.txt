Just tell me when fees will go down to like 2 cents and transactions are less than 10 seconds, like it used to be, like they promised it be. Otherwise this is worthless. No chance this price ever goes up if fees are still absurd and transaction times are taking longer than your average bankwire.

I just sent some from coinbase to my wallet and I paid $30. Took like 40 minutes to complete 6 comfirmations. Not what it used to be man. 
Also, where in the world do I only have to pay $1 for fees?
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:56:57
Bitcoin sucks. Fees cost so much money. Transactions take forever. I’m tired of this
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:45:13
Lol I know. I have no idea what a fucking wire transfer is.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:59:41
When will the $20 fees go away?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:37:04
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:00:10
Does anyone know when the fees will go away? Or will they go up forever?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:48:06
Well yeah most altcoins are like that. My question is if these fees will be $100 in a year?

@_date: 2017-12-28 02:25:51
Are fees going to be going up forever? It’s like $30 now. Is there an effort to fix this
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:40:49
Gotcha, its been a little over 180 minutes now. It should be going through soon correct? I need it to go through by like 7:30 pm US eastern time
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:40:24
Perfect. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:30:23
Ok I mean it’s $12 fees to send bitcoin. I’ve already bought them. Am I able to send to an external address from GDAX?

Oh hello again. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:58:02
"It may not go down as predicted" well i'm talking about the confidence this guy has that its going lower. If I'm him and I believe that its going lower then he should just sell and buy back lower. I'm all for hodling but it makes no logic sense just to watch your money decrease

You go to LSU?

Everyone on Reddit is a genius. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:46:56
If that's the case then why not pull out now then buy back when it's lower?
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:50:23
They take cash. I've used that exact machine before in BR

@_date: 2017-10-09 15:19:25
Oh brother this is scary. I wish they would just give higher fees
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:48:13
What is the halving?
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:48:11
Appreciate it thanks
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:47:55
It was a reasonable question. My post has urged much discussion which should be seen as a positive in this community. Sad to say the least
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:27:19
I bought for the first time about 2 hours before the initial drop 2 weeks ago. Fml
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:03:40
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:17:43
Yeah according to that bloconomics sight it's supposed to take 4:45 hours 
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:19:36
So you don't think it'll go under  3700?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:36:20
I bought a lot at $4,800, about two hours later the initial tank began
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:16:06
It's been 3 hours fuck my ass! Bloconomics just added another 5 hours
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:01:19
I selected regular. So how long would you expect this to take? Is it possible I lose it all together?
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:00:49
How long does the transfer to the bank typically take?
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:59:26
Well I'm sure the blocks have been found by now. Nevertheless, I am not even close to getting a confirmation 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:32:01
I'd be down
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:49:36
It keeps pushing back the time. I'm just hoping that it's today 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:17:53
Sorry I don't know much about bitcoin transactions. Wouldn't the blocks be found faster with a higher fee?
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:28:17
Got it thanks
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:17:46
I personally enjoy the price talk. You should enjoy things in life more.
