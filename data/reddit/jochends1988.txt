It will probably be something with the fee i guess.. I thought those things would automatically adjust. I do have the old Multibit classic where i am transfering my bitcoins tho.. So this means that i have to fee around 10$ to get it transfer? That seems insane for regular transfer happening all over the world.. Any way of transfer it from my one wallet to the new one without paying that much of a fee? I guess waiting till the network is slowed down? But how can i tell
I did a resend after 4 days of nothing but now i will just let the blockchain do its work..

They don't match... I did the same as you said tho
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:24:07
Thanks, i look into it. For the people who are also interested in this.
The link of eustan doesn't work and is the following:

Strange :/
Now i see on the same tx link that my 'received time' is 21th of may @ 17:01. I only did the transaction around the 16th. Isnt this going to be in a loop if he is automatically trying to push the bitcoins to the other wallet? My fee is very low and i don't think it will ever arrive. A cancellation with a newer fee seems more logical than?

People are saying Bitcoin is dead since 2013. 2017 already and growing. Hodl and see 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:58:57
Ok i see.. i suppose i better send the bitcoins from HD to Electrum.. To bad the unconfirmed transactions are so high now :(
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:47:37
Hmm.. Just did it the way you told, but the balance on Electrum stays on 0 ?
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:09:40
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:14:42
Does this also have to do with my old wallet i have sended with( multibit classic ) ? The reason i was sending from old to new wallet was to not have such a problems in the future.. I know many got this problems now but most of them got the coins back after 2-4 days.. i am on the 6th day now and the 'received time' is 21th of may again :/
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:48:42
I use Electrum now. Seems to be the best
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:19:17
Easy solution to that. I had different unconfirmed transactions for weeks. With the following link they were confirmed in +- 2 hours. paste your TX in it
You need to do this on every hour ( 1 time is enough )(17:00,16:00...) if you try it @ 1 minute passed it will probably be full again and you won't be able to make the transaction as a priority on the miner..

I am happy with Bittrex
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:23:09
This seems indeed to be the best option.. Try as fast as you can to open your wallet ( on another PC ) with your seed and send the coins to another wallet you create ( be sure to write your new seed )
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:16:29
Many people are getting a heart attack watching coinmarketcap now i guess :D
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:07:05
Found even this guys!
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:18:02
Try it @ every hour so the pool is empty to send your TX
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:16:44
If Bitcoin falls, other alts also fall it seems.. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:52:48
It was another server, but i changed it manually and it's still the same. Perhaps i did something wrong with that seed.. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:50:58
Let your coins stay in Electrum and wait for 1 august and the days after. Nothing will happen with your coins
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:52:56
We were so naïve :D
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:58:56
Hi. The seed in wallet is greyed out? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:21:44
Spread your money on different low crypto's en hodl hoping we can look back in 2020 and see a big increase again on those coins :D
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:13:55
Thats normal. You need to do it @ 17:00,18:00.... Else the pool is full again on 17:01,16:01 etc... 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:25:26
Indeed.. Noticed the same
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:45:12
I tryed exactly that.. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:52:30
Different blogs from that time
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:34:46
I don't understand. I have sended the coins to another new wallet and everything is fine now. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:00:08
 is the best for me. Do it @ every :00 ( 17:00, 18:00 etc.. ) than the pool is empty and you will be in the first 100 people to send your TX to the miner but you need to be very fast. I had several transactions stuck for weeks. This fixed it every time for me withing +- 2 hours
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:09:29
Electrum on the other PC has internet access and is online 
@_date: 2017-06-26 09:32:37
I'm a hodler but i saw my total coins went down with 2000€ in just 2 days. Only in Crypto! I thought i bought my last coins @ a good dip but seems otherwise now.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:40:11
Is without doubt the best
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:18:18
Same here with Bitstamp. Many newcomers i think
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:05:45
I think we need to stay hodling it because it's ment to be a payment system. If Bitcoin would increase much further you could use the Bitcoins as it was ment for.. Paying with it and buying things untill Bitcoin could get replaced somehow.. That's my opinium. If you think about how long you need to hodl it, it seems you're not really believing in the product itself.
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:55:40
You better send all your coins to Electrum. Having such an old wallet can give problems.. ( also change your fee on multibit classic in the options or you have to wait a long time for the transactions ). It doesn't go automatic in their
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:57:56
Bitcoin is rising 500$ in a few days = normal for most.
Bitcoin is falling 500$ over a day = BITCOIN IS DIEING!!
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:53:24
My deposit worked fine a week ago. You can try to send an email to the support or on Facebook
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:31:20
I tryed it also.. I can't believe it has to do with Ethereum tho.. Maybe something wrong with my seed? If i open my wallet file i can see my balance on the new PC and the receiving address is the same. When i try the seed the address is different and 0 balance. Any way to make a new seed for this? I have private keys, password, wallet file, can still open my proper wallet.... I guess sending the coins from 1 wallet to another can fix it but with the extra fee and the long waiting time i would rather have something easier like export/import
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:18:25
I did it a lot with transactions stuck for weeks.. Works every time if you get in the pool
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:23:53
Not if their are coins left in his wallet..
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:07:50
Yes it does show you.. You can change the amount of fee but than you can have a long time waiting for a confirmation if you set it to low. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:11:37
Same here. Different than the exchanges. Some problems with coinmarketcap i think
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:19:40
Even more nostalgia...

No.. We are Negan! 
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:02:09
Use something else than Coinbase.. Options enough. There is always a problem with Coinbase it seems.
