Lol he literally ordered hits on people; this goes beyond the war on drugs Reddit meme

He was never convicted because the hits were never executed. However, he was charged in a District of Maryland court. See "Count Two" in [this]( court document.

I don't think anonymous comments on Reddit do anything to either assist or detract from his case. I don't think he should be serving a life sentence but let's not pretend he didn't know exactly what he was risking when he started his empire. Part of the reason he was able to make so much money is because of the inherent risk involved in what he was doing. Whether or not he agreed with U.S. drug laws he knew the consequences of breaking them. They are a large part of why The Silk Road was so successful—he profited off mitigating risk for many drug producers and consumers.
His use of hitmen hasn't been proven but it's hardly incredible given the nature of the business he was doing and the sacrosanct anonymity of his clients. I'm not at all convinced of his ideologically pure motives—that this was all just an act of civil disobedience or "helping" drug addicts. Unlike other folklore hacker heroes like Edward Snowden, Ulbricht was a profiteer, and the war on drugs was directly responsible for both his success and his downfall.
