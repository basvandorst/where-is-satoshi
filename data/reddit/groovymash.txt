You and I are on the same page. I submitted this just 10 minutes ago to r/btc:
BIP-102.21 Blocksize-hardfork-compromise](
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:50:48
Yes, I agree. I think bitcoin's *value* is ultimately tied to real-world things, such as the energy required to mine. The people who are confused by the divisibility of bitcoin, are not wrong. If bitcoin is just *information*, then yes, its divisibility does make a single bitcoin indistinguishable from 1/1000th of a bitcoin. Just as one can store an infinite amount of information in a singe irrational number. But, when bitcoin is exchanged for a real-world object, it's value gets pegged to the world we live in. How much bitcoin will buy an actual cookie in the real world? That's where it's value gets determined. Not with how much bitcoin can represent a "cookie".
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:37:31
Nice summary.
When Segwit was released I initially thought it would activate quickly. But it hasn't. And it is unlikely to reach 95%.
Core developers and supporters might need to take a hard look in the mirror at how this happened. Segwit is reasonably good tech, and they had the incumbent *default* bitcoin client.
In my opinion, there has been a stubborn unwillingness to compromise from Core, which were handed stewardship of the Bitcoin client.
Now, we're at an impasse. And the lock on the "default" client is in jeopardy. We'll see how it all plays out..
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:54:54


That is the essential point upon which people disagree.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:43:58


Just my opinion, of course! But still..


Whether "that is the compromise" is not really up to you to decide for others. Obviously a significant amount of the community disagrees. I'm one of them, truthfully. I'll be fine if Segwit activates, perhaps even happy. But, I don't personally consider it a compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:30:27
I know. I haven't said anything new in this post. Maybe only the generals analogy. But, the notion of a pyrric victory would be good for everyone to keep in mind.
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:40:32
Could someone please explain:
How is arguing about miners vs full-nodes different that arguing which came first, the chicken or the egg?
I'm serious. We're chasing our tails with this argument. Unless someone can set me straight...
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:31:53


I see this slippery-slope argument a lot on this forum. The two are in no way equivalent! How many people read the white paper and thought: "Great idea. I love how the blocksize is limited to 1Mb so that decentralization risks are mitigated."
Everyone must learn the nuances and tradeoffs between blocksize and burden on the network as they understand Bitcoin more.
The 21 million supply, in contrast, is a premise virtually everyone learns about Bitcoin from the beginning.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:17:09
I agree. I doubt anyone can reliably measure it. That's why I think the false dichotomy is silly:




Duh. It's neither. Or both. Or, they are inextricably entangled.
One truth: It is easier to measure *miner* sentiment, than other participants and users of the bitcoin network. That at least, is indisputable. Or, maybe not these days..
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:31:41
Yes, that's the "plan". But, that plan isn't working so well. So, potentially adjusting the strategy is the smart move.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:58:25
Sure. In an ideal world. But the Bitcoin community is not currently operating ideally.
But it is also *very* technically feasible to raise the blocksize without Segwit. And, there is already 40% of the hashrate on board with a blocksize increase (BU miners/nodes).
Plus, since Core never released a blocksize signalling mechanism, no one really knows the support for a small blocksize increase among the Core troops.
My opinion: A small increase, with Core's stamp of approval, would win the day easily.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:53:40
This was a great compromise. A *year* ago. Now, I don't think core is capable of a compromise, in which they lose "face". Everyone pretends these arguments are all logical and technical. But, those caught up in their own intellects are the last to see the human side of their own beliefs.
Anyone who is open to a 2MB hardfork, should not fear BU too much. The plan is simple and somewhat elegant. Yes, it's "unknown", and thus feared by some. But Bitcoin, itself, was "impossible" when it first came out.
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:58:37
Let me clarify: Many people in rbtc *do* understand what you wrote.
Including myself. (Whether, or not, I read rbtc as well as rbitcoin.) I've been following bitcoin for 4+ years, very closely.
1) Nodes follow chain with most proof of work. (see 2 below)
2) Miners mine on the chain with most economic use. (see 1 above)
You could easily reverse 1) and 2). Thus, chicken and egg.
But, hey! I'm still looking to have my mind "opened". Your response didn't do it, however.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:27:13
Thanks for the answer. I appreciate it!


Yes, but what are "the nodes". Some nodes will have obviously updated (otherwise, why would miners switch?), while other nodes will not. Thus "the nodes" does not distinguish between the two categories.


That also assumes that nodes and miners are mutually exclusive sets. But, some miners will obviously be running "nodes" and be users of the chain as well.
Question: What is "a node", in your mind? Is that just a bitcoin user/business who cares enough to run their own node?
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:12:40
That still doesn't mean it won't be a Pyrric victory.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:45:19
OP, sounds like you are a reasonable person. Unfortunately, that doesn't count for much these days!
As for compromise: Any one person at any given moment can compromise in their own mind. Sounds like you have. It's a much more peaceful way to be.
As for others, some will never compromise. And I believe the lead developers of Core, and the hardliners of this r/bitcoin sub won't.
Thus, they are, themselves, architects of their own self-fulfilling "contentious" fork, should BU continue gaining.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:36:20
Actually, BU can't be killed. The notion of a flexible blocksize will *always* be there. It will ebb and flow in popularity and power, depending entirely upon the actions of those who hold-the-line on the blocksize. I (along with other posters I've seen), are simply recommending moving that line as a defensive measure.
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:26:50
Thanks for saying I'm right! ;)


You've taken my analogy to a whole new level! But, I'm going to stay neutral on what's the chicken and what's the egg. But, I agree, both rbtc and rbitcoin focus on one more than the other. Some of the focus is outlandishly extreme.
Bitcoin is a delicious chicken-stuffed-omelette. However, lately it's been tasting a bit spoiled...
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:54:24
Hi. I don't want to belabor my chicken-egg analogy too much. But..


If the "chain" produced in 2 is not the same as the "chain" validated in 1, then we need to use a 2 different words! Otherwise, it's apples-oranges. Not, chicken-egg.
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:44:07
Your statement has been repeated and repeated and repeated. Everyone has heard this. Here and on rbtc.
Yet, Segwit did not activate. Thus, there must be something else going on, don't you think?
Unless you understand the arguments of your opponents, then you don't really understand your own position.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:46:00
I appreciate the sentiment of your post. Core-supporters have made many mistakes this past year. Not voluntarily honoring the Hong Kong agreement was the biggest, in my opinion. Sure "core" didn't agree to it. But, it was the only "treaty" out there. Honoring it would have been a simple compromise. Now, the default client and protocol may be changing hands. I, personally, am fine with that. The stewardship of core has been abysmal, to my eyes.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:01:56


That's really an unenlightened misrepresentation of the concerns of people who want &gt; 1Mb blocks.


Perhaps it is time for Core to officially release a 2 or 4 Mb on-chain blocksize increase as an option?
That would prevent a contentious fork in the short term, buy time for 2nd layer options, and signal to the market that they are capable of compromise. As a side benefit, Core would maintain control of the "official" Bitcoin client. Who knows, maybe even Segwit would activate as well?!
In my mind, this is the obvious solution. But, too many people would have to swallow a bitter compromise-pill. I'm not sure this community is capable of that.
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:54:47


Fair point. However just because feelings are "not rational" does not imply they are irrational. And, when building consensus with human beings, the feelings of those humans are, indeed, relevant for development.
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:58:44
If you feel that way, my post would be more appropriately labeled "concern-trolling" than "FUD". ;)
But, I don't consider it either one.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:37:06
True. By the time exchanges have made a decision, it will already be a done-deal. However, if exchanges list both 1x and 2x, it will be hard to even get your 1x coins on an exchange if the hashpower is too low to create blocks with any regularity.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:19:43
Thank you for the breath of fresh-air reasonableness. It is in short supply these days!
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:12:08


(I somehow missed this point, the first time I read your response.)
It's a good replay that actually answers what I asked! Thanks.
My follow up: What is the chance that the nodes don't follow a 95% mining consensus? No one knows! (I'm guessing it's small.) Why would the nodes differ drastically from the mining consensus? But, even if there was a node-split of say 50/50, would a 5% hashrate be relevant to the main chain? Wouldn't 50% of nodes be enough to broadcast transactions for the main chain?
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:27:09
Hi. Well, I'm still looking for an answer to my question!
But, I'll answer yours: It's cleaner because you're not re-interpreting an "anyone-can-spend" transaction. But, truthfully, I don't want to get into technical nitty gritty. I'll leave that to the experts. ;)
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:27:25
Help me connect the dots! I'm not getting what you mean exactly.
Softfork gives miners control? (But, then at 95% activation, most of them would have to agree.)
Aren't small-blockers interested in the power-of-the-nodes?
Then according to your reasoning, isn't a softfork against this node-power? And thus, my question still stands: Why not a 95% hardfork.
Anyway, I'm not sure I've grokked your point, just yet.
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:43:03

@_date: 2017-08-10 12:34:13


That's an interesting point: Latent hashpower will come online. I hadn't thought of that. Will it be enough? Only time will tell..
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:38:22
Hi. Thanks for the answer. You believe that a hardfork is irrational?
Ok. I don't see that, myself. For a 75% activation, I can see the preference for a softfork. But, once you ask for 95%, I see the softfork/hardfork distinction becoming virtually meaningless. However, a hardfork allows a cleaner implementation. (Plus a potential blocksize increase, if that was desired, to bring in people who felt disenfranchised. But a main reason given for no blocksize increase was the *danger* of a hardfork)
Anyway, these debates can go on ad-nauseum. I still wonder at the 95% activation for the softfork. I truly wonder! It's such a high bar to meet, that you might as well gain the benefits that can come from a hardfork. But, I could be wrong!
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:07:57
I kind of agree. So, how does the 1x chain survive on potentially less than 15% of the hashpower? Does it just wait a long time for the next difficulty adjustment?
@_date: 2017-01-29 03:37:36
If you're gonna get all-logical on me, then:
Assuming: irrational =&gt; not rational
does not necessarily imply the converse is true:
not rational =&gt; irrational
But, human language is much more flexible than logic. A lot of logical people think emotions are irrational, when really emotions might just be: not rational, but emotional.
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:52:44


True. But that will be true of any block-size increase, as far as I know.
My thinking: Burning BTC for block-size would at least reduce the incentive to just create larger blocks, because the space is there to fill up. Also, it "pays" the holders of BTC by reducing the total supply of coins.
@_date: 2016-12-15 14:56:35
I read up on Bitcoin-NG. It's a very interesting idea. However, Bitcoin's protocol is pretty resistant to change these days. So, it's unlikely to be implemented.
What I like about this proof-of-burn idea, is everything else about the current protocol stays the same. Larger blocks just come with a price of some BTC. But, even if this idea stood up to further analysis, it still probably has 0% chance of being implemented
@_date: 2017-01-29 02:53:02
You're right. I don't know that. It is just my opinion. After the scaling conference in late 2015, I think a compromise could have bridged the divide of the community nonetheless, and made a hardfork virtually unanimous. But, no one can know that now, because it was never proposed.
I've read Paul's article that you linked, and I really appreciate his take on the cryptocurrency space. But, the idea that a hardfork of the blocksize represents "breaking an existing contract", is a little bit of a red-herring. None of the economic consensus rules of bitcoin is being changed. Just size of blocks containing *legal* transactions. So, I don't buy the slippery-slope argument.
However, I'm not of an opinion that a hardfork is "the way to go". Consensus is the way to go! If, with Segwit, the definition of consensus is 95%, then that high bar might have been reached easier with a compromise solution. And that compromise, most likely, would have required a hardfork to satisfy more of the participants in the bitcoin space.

Question: Do you think the same is true of the "recovery words" used in many wallets? If you have a 24 word seed list, and split it in half. Would the 12 word subset be safe from a brute force attack?
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:24:47
I think you're right, in order to achieve a 2 of 3 "multisig" paper wallet. Then you need 3*12 words.
But, just splitting the 24 words into 2 groups would give a 2 of 2 multisig, wouldn't it? Which might be enough. Especially if you're just worried about a backup paper being found by someone. If you're worried that you might lose one of your copies, then 2 of 3 would be safer.
@_date: 2015-08-07 04:23:57


Yes. Or it can be considered "Bitcoin". ;)
 
All the changes in rules, and percentages of adoption, and other pieces of the puzzle are just corollaries to the "wooden parts" of Theseus's ship. There will be a different "coin" after a fork. Calling it an altcoin, newcoin, or Bitcoin, will also be a matter of consensus.
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:58:53


I agree with that. I thought segwit would activate rapidly.
However, there is more than just one type of "monopoly" in the world. Question to you: Why is *segwit* the protocol upgrade people are considering, in contrast to others? That is where the potential monopoly power comes into play. Monopoly is not really the right term, to describe this. Instead, it's incumbency.
Core is the default client, for historical reasons. That history gives that client, and those who control it, much more power. It doesn't mean the power is necessarily used for ill. But, it is power nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:03:30


Well, you're throwing around a generic term, without specifying a monopoly of *what*.
    Core doesn't have a monopoly on banana imports.
    Therefore Core doesn't have a monopoly.
Core doesn't have a monopoly on hashpower, or who uses Bitcoin, or many things. It doesn't then follow that they don't have a "monopoly" on something else. However "monopoly" has such a strong meaning, that is almost tautologically never held by anyone in the real world.
Does Core have a *huge* influence on what protocols are even considered? Yes.
Does it have a "monopoly" on this? No.
In your OP, you claimed BU supporters have failed to respond to this. Well, here is a response. Do I need to be a BU-supporter to satisfy your demand? My statements stand on their own.
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:22:15


Easily lost? Not sure. I'm not here to quibble, but if bitcoin didn't *require* consensus among most of the participants, then it would be like having a debate about emacs verses VIM. Fun but meaningless, in other words. Core would not have the power it does.
I take the of lack of consensus for Segwit as a direct measure of whether that power was *misused*, to use your term. However, the news about asicboost did potentially call into question the validity of this "measure". So, Bitcoin continues it's quest to be the most interesting and frustrating technology of the past decade!
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:52:24

Core released code that *required* 95% of the mining community to approve it. Yet, where was the consultation with the mining community about their wishes? The hashpower voting came nowhere near 95%, until now, with segwit2x.
Building consensus was also a primary job of the "owners" of the legacy default client.  They have failed at that task in so may different ways.

@_date: 2017-06-05 21:29:47
Fallacy. I agree. Yet the slippery-slope has been used *many* times in this sub to argue against *any* increase in block-size. Such as:
* Then miners will vote in gazillion-megabyte blocks
* Then miners could raise the 21 million coin limit
Both of which are fallacious slippery-slope arguments.
The point is: Neither "hard" nor "soft" forks are safe or dangerous, without looking at the exact change being proposed.
The segwit-UASF is not "safe", just because it's a "soft" fork. It's potentially as disruptive as many of the alternative hard-forks proposed in the past. It should be judged on its merits. Not on its purported "soft-fork"-ness.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:00:54
Which is the "highly sensitive subject"? There are many in Bitcoin these days...
However, blurring the hard/soft fork distinction that has been used for the last three years obfuscate discussion is a useful exercise, in my opinion. That was the intention of my post.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:46:48
This is a good answer. Succinct and to the point.
OP: If you really don't understand something. Dig deeper.
Segwit needs 95% miner support for activation. Did core even query the miners to ask what they might want? I know of 3 measures of miner's wishes:
1) The Hong-Kong agreement: 2mb+Segwit
2) Current miner signalling: 40% bigger blocks/30% segwit
3) The latest 2mbSegwit agreement.
The real question is: Why hasn't core responded more effectively to this signalling?
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:41:48
It's my attempt at a slippery-slope argument. In general, I'm not a fan of those. But, the notion of that:
Soft-fork == safe
Hard-fork == dangerous!
can be dispelled by this coin-burning example.
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:49:47
True. That's why I suggested burning *any* early coins that haven't moved at all. But, my suggestion was merely rhetorical.
