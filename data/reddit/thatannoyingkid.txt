I've heard alot about electrum. Is it easy to use and navigate? I done a bit of research prior to posting this and I'm currently using exodus. It's very user friendly but my concern is security with the recent hack of nicehash. I'd love a hardware wallet like the nano ledger s but I don't have the money to be spending £70 to store bitcoin.

I'll have a look into switching to electrum for the time being until I can afford a hardware wallet. Appreciate the info!

Believe me, it's top of the list when I get the money to buy one, I've only read good reviews. How easy are they to use and do transactions to them work the same as to a normal wallet?

Thanks for the info man! I'll have a look into getting one after Christmas.

4% fees for buying and selling, so essentially you lose 8% to coinbase. Sign into gdax with your coinbase account details (they're a sister exchange or something) and save yourself on the fees. It's 0.25% fees on gdax and 0% fees if you do limit orders

Yeah, it's as simple as that. Instantaneous transfers between your coinbase and gdax accounts. As long as you have money in either and don't need to bank transfer or what not. It'll be an instant switch from one wallet to the other. Google it and read up on it but feel free to message me if you don't understand something, I'll be happy to help where I can.

Search the PC you bought the BTC on for 'wallet.dat'. Other than that the only option you have is to check through emails for any information on the wallet and try guess the password you used for it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:42:28
Yeah try this on the PC that you bought them on if you still have access to it

There is no catch. Most people don't know about gdax, some like coinbases dumbed down UI and some aren't big enough into buying bitcoin to care about the 8% loss. If you plan on investing more than $250 in total I'd switch to gdax or a similar exchange so you aren't getting shafted in fees.

You the man! HODL on

That's true, I can't see a massive crash but I reckon we're due a £500 drop soon then a big recovery. What do you think? Do you reckon it'll start to dip this week with the upcoming Bitcoin Gold release?
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:22:37
What exchange would you advise to use?
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:47:16
I'm only reinvesting 25% of what I have so I want to lift the rest out into my bank account
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:46:30
It'll eventually crash, so I plan to buy again then
