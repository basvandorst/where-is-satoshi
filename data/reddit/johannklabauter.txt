New egg takes crypto or bitpay?
The later is not really the same then the first.

Not how it works
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:36:00


That's a dictatorship and has nothing to do with socialism. You are an idiot, if that's your two believe.
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:56:02


That's not how socialism works. Stupid stupid Americans.
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:56:02
Your illiterat and purely talking out of your ass.
It's sad how little you know about Scandinavia, yet you speak. That's ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:01:40
For first world 20% can be difficult. That's generally unrealistic.
@_date: 2019-06-19 07:37:51
Your political spectrum is 100% wrong.
Socialism n such is left wing. Dictatorship is right wing. It's an extreme opposite.
  
Socialism is awesome, it's makes the population wealthy and rich. Look at Scandinavia these are countries with somewhat a socialism / social system.
Watch this learn more about why that's good.
Link: [Where in the world is it easiest to get rich? \| Harald Eia \| TEDxOslo](
Spoiler: Scandinavia, that's the only social countries on this planet.
  
Also everything in the USA is hardcore right wing. Neither of the two parties is even close to the center.
  
So I get it, your political view is fucked up. You don't know what socialism is, all Americans know is right wing shit.

No I'm not. You are just clueless.
  
Bitcoin is inflationary in supply until 2141. Because of mining.
  
And bitcoin is inflationary in valuation of goods. See last year.
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:49:03
Hilarious. All you can do is insult. Rational arguments are beyond your reach.
  


  
Do you know what double standards are?
We do know the inflation rate of the USD, it's public at all times just like Bitcoin. You could just as well say that USD has 2% unclaimed coins per year.
  
You are ridiculously simple minded for having double standards. It's ridiculous. Lol. 
Bitcoin inflates heavily, more than the USD. Your double standards can't censor facts written on a public ledger, the bitcoin Blockchain that is. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:51:58
No. The fuck are you clueless.
  
It was inflation and deflation in a row, that's a mess. Check the source linked earlier. The FED came into place to focus this shit show and provide constant growth.
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:08:53


Productive behavior such as HODLING? 
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:40:18


And much lower. The total supply is deflationary at times.
I know because I usually use the M1 supply as source.
I'm well aware of what types of supply, their meaning and the public pages to check the numbers.
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:10:29
Realising that one has double standards, right.
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:45:04


Of course, it's run by humans and such are imperfect. Shit will always happen.   
The point is that it was worse before then. 


It's a verifiable fact. But to know this you have to do some fact checking, that's something you have prove not to do.
The rest of your post is bullshit. Short cycles are not good that's just stupid every single crash is bad, doing something bad more frequent is worse not better.
If you have difficulties understanding this, well then you are an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:23:18


Clearly not.
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:00:31
Look at the first 100 years of the USA, that's the time without the FED. It was a Rollercoaster.
  
Ups and downs of ±20%. We have been there, we have done that. We know that the free market is not suited for what you desire.

It's data straight from the Bitcoin blockchain. Lol, you are hilarious.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:53:05


Let's fact check that on Google.
 
Link: 
Bitcoins generated per day: 1,800
  
Bitcoin inflation rate per annum: 3.84%
Bitcoin inflation per day (USD): $6,721,740
And it's 80% inflationary concerning valuation of goods, over the last year.
Conclusion based on facts: Bitcoin inflates in total supply and validation of goods.
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:22:05


Rest assured that I do my research before talking.  However that's some more hand waving nonsense, you basically say nothing.
What precise history are you talking about, provide some numbers if you can. I bet my ass that after the FED was established that the economy grow far more prosperous. However show some facts go on. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:09:09
I still hold some. So ofc do I want it to go up
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:57:32


No, I don't. You need to make sure you read carefully if you think so.
The dude was talking about supply. Concerning this Bitcoin is inflationary, or to be more precise it is disinflationary until 2141. 


That is inflation concerning the valuation of goods. Concerning this Bitcoin is down 80% over the past year.
If you read carefully through the original posts I responded to, then you will learn that the dude said it's deflationary concerning total supply what is wrong. But it's also wrong when someone says it's deflationary concerning valuation of goods. Either way, I was right and whoever says bitcoin is anything but inflationary is an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:36:39


Of course not. Just like there is no doubt about bitcoin inflation until 2141. 
Bitcoin miners, mine bitcoins all day. Don't you know that?
Your argument shows that you know nothing about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:00:08
It's inflationary concerning the supply until 2141. Get your facts straight.

@_date: 2018-12-28 18:27:27


I clearly do. The monetary inflation for Bitcoin is ~4% for the last year.
That's verifiable, it's taken straight from the blockchain.
  
If you deny this then you know nothing about Bitcoin and should not talk about it. Lol


Not yet. The distribution phase is not over. We still have miners creating 1800coins a day. That's monetary inflation.
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:38:06
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:14:04


And the economy after the FED was established worked even better. That's a fact. Economy was after that time far more prosperous. That is another fact. 
Do your research before you write.

Uh, I clearly did. But you don't even bother to click the sources you were given with direct links.
So either you are lazy or stupid.  I can share it again but walk you step by step through it, like a child would need it.
Let's start with a TL;DR:
**During the 1800s the USA had many short cycles of inflation and deflation. Inflation during boom years and deflation during recessions. Boom and bust cycles were more frequent than today and ressessions regularly went on for years.**
That's bad, this means the economy was doing good and then was doing horribly bad, it was jumping like crazy from year to year.
In detail:
Look at this link here and read it carefully, [
Look at that image on this page: [
What you see is that the chart has an horrible variance, it's a roller coaster. It's dangerous jumps from 40% inflation to -20% deflation.
The job of the FED is to control this, simply put everything extreme is always bad.
So yeah, I do my due diligence. And clearly you don't. You can't even be bothered to read direct links you were given. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:40:12
That is some serious hand waving with very little truth in it.
Like: Can you ensure that the growth rates are only related to the FED and nothing else? No, you can't do that. because you just did some hand-waving. 
Like yes the government should not have bailed out the banks, and shouldn't do it in general, like Iceland did last. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:34:05
Bitcoin inflates until 2141.
So it's inflationary in total supply and in valuation of goods as it's down 80%.
Know what your are investing in.
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:20:01
I don't understand what you wrote. Could you pretty please point me towards good resource to read up on it?
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:10:26
Yes, it's disinflationary.
Fiat is constantly 0-2%.
 
The disinflation makes BTC good. It's a minor detail shills leave out. 
Whoever says that Bitcoin is deflationary is a liar, because it's disinflationary until 2141.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:33:42


It's not a currency, so no there is no point in spending it.
However I took a profit in January, I'm not an idiot and so know how a bubble looks like. I hope everyone is smart enough to not hodl forever. 
  
If you think it's a currency then you should head over to the crazy dudes fighting over satoshi's vision. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
