Right now I'm wasting my time by doing this manually because I have no $25, if everyone could contribute some little encouragement here 19BPfE7Kkj1faepkt7xMqHbVZpfz4JRkpL then I would create BEAUTIFUL STAMPS which would help me &amp; my friends to put marks on 1 million rubles ($30,000) ;)

Bitcoin generates more transactions per each customer. So fake numbers can become real for Bitcoin once it will gain mass adoption.
* Bitcoin should be used for microtransactions like 1 cent &amp; should be free.
* Every person should have access for sending 1 cent even 1000 times per day
* Every teapot, every door, every dancefloor &amp; every living &amp; non-living creature must have a BTC address. No doors should be opened without BTC &amp; no device should be used without BTC micropayment.
1TB per day is pretty possible scenario in case of worldwide adoption. Bitcoin is useful because you can microtransact with it.
But you won't have to worry if Bitcoin scales to this point if you're not willing to become Bitcoin core developer, because even if Bitcoin lacks some bandwidth, I can spend my Bitcoin to purchase that bandwidth. &amp; if that bandwidth is expensive, at the time it will become mainstream, it will be possible to be covered by microtransactions.
So - more microtransactions means more bandwidth. More microtransactions is a luxury. Each small microtransaction uses bandwidth &amp; each bandwidth are just an infrastructure. And infrastructure is just a one-time payment. If its a one time payment, that means that microdonations can easily cover that type of expense.
So problem here is not Bitcoin. Problem here is how do we scale the Internet to 1TB per day. I want access to 100 TB per day already now for making my city rich of Bitcoin microtransactions. I'm ready to pay this price even if its really expensive price. &amp; I am getting my fiberoptics ready now, because I'm a qualified network engineer. I can find relatively cheap ways to scale to 1000 TB transactions per day. So don't worry about me or bandwidth. Do your own job, I will provide the rest.
I don't care how much space or electricity will be consumed for making sure the freedom for generations to come.

You have no idea that there's no such thing as international bank transfer.
Forget it.
It doesn't exists.
N O   I N T E R N A T I O N A L   W I R E.
We didn't invented that.
Never existed.
Why? Because it goes exactly like this: their crappy fees, their crappy delivery time (it takes 2 months to deliver 1 payment!), crappy bureaucracy (you have to sign 5 different papers &amp; must go to 5 different consultant in the bank where you should receive signs), crappy service, crappy fees ($150 sounds reasonable for 1 transaction?), crappy banking hours, crappy sanctions, changing political situations are just making it easier to send gold in regular paper envelope/shipping
&amp; Their services sounds almost like insult &amp; treatment like an animal.
If you still think that its exist, then probably you haven't tried it yourself :) Try it &amp; you'll doubt that we're living in 2015, no this banks don't figured out how to use any basic computers at all.

just learned that expedia is with Microsoft since 1996!!! This video is so crazy! Because at that time people did believed that by making information free Internet will harm the art, creativity &amp; other stuff which previously was sold by copyright legal entities.
I'm pretty sure at that time people listened to this speech &amp; thought "Well, that's (iTunes/YouTube/etc other micropayment platforms) never gonna happen. Maybe in 100 years, but very unlikely...". 
People at least considered his talk "too optimistic" "off the ground", "unrealistic".
But once everything happened, those near-sighted people just vanished somewhere... 
Be careful those trolls are still among us, they're watching you :D
TL;DR: I believe if Bill Gates learned (or at least got some cryptonerd talk about the idea behind) Bitcoin that day, he would make everything possible to make it priority for the next generation &amp; would even wrote the books about it.

you can use bitaddress.org brain wallet to create locks - e.g. "passphrase XXXX" where XXXX is random 4 digits number which you should forget &amp; where "passphrase" is some random phrase you shouldn't forget. If your 4-digits gonna be as random as possible, then to fill up all the passphrase possibilities will bring you 9999 payments divide this number on 365 - and you will have perfect 27 years to fill up all possibilities in your locker.
To increase difficulty for the locks I would recommend using pattern generation - e.g. enter passphrase, copy private key - reuse this privatekey to generate another passphrase to make a chain containing from generated private keys.

Yeah we don't want to be dependent from their willingness or not-willingness to censor/send withdraw or not to withdraw, deposit or not to deposit our money. But they have 1 thing - convenience.
I would really love learning to use mycellium local trader &amp; localbitcoins. But might be too complicated for a regular transaction.
What's interesting for me - is using checks/internal U.S. wire transfer to send people money through LocalBitcoins. That would be veeeery interesting.
You know why? Because that would mean partly independence from banking system! Because you can use P2P service from LocalBitcoins to handle this deal &amp; your regular bank will think that its just a regular transaction from your friend's bank to your friend's bank...
We're used Montain America Bank services which is established since 1936. I think their banking accounts are pretty much simple to use! Their customer representative was so much helpful in solving our problem with Online Banking problem yesterday. 
&amp; Login is so simple! I think this existing financial infrastructure could be really efficient way to send money if there would be the way to wire transfer with ability to finalize that wire transaction &amp; that's what guarantees your protection in a P2P deal. &amp; That's what gives you convenience because you don't need to go to meet someone in-person &amp; pay for his gasoline.

it takes implementing only 1 feature to stop me doing that: allowing me to chat without ever freezing my Bitcoins.
They already implemented this on "Buy Bitcoins" page. Why they can't do the same on "Sell Bitcoins" page? Why to have such a horrible left-handed UI?
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:01:29
I would recommend this TECH-SAVVY way to store your Bitcoins:
1. Go to "Brain Wallet" section in bitaddress.org
2. Think about very random, very secure phrase. Let's say its gonna be "My-VeRy-SeCuRe-BrAiN-WaLlEtT", but don't hurry up to use this phrase to create your keypairs, we need to increase encryption a little bit. See step 3.
3. Change your phrase to look like this "My-VeRy-SeCuRe-BrAiN-WaLlEtT 1348" - where 1348 is a random number which you should make sure to forget about it. Really. You must remember the whole phrase, but forget about this random number (and make sure its only 4 digits! not 5 and not 3/2/1)
4. Using keyphrase+numbers which you've just made up (My-VeRy-SeCuRe-BrAiN-WaLlEtT 348) generate your bitcoin address/privatekey:
a. Don't save your private key yet. Just copy generated private key into clipboard (ctrl+C)
b. Use copied private key as the passphrase to generate next Bitcoin wallet/private key. But don't save this private key, you must CTRL+C this one too. You are creating path from private keys chain to use them to create new pairs over &amp; over again.
c. Repeat this 100 times (but don't count how much times you did it, for the sake of your own security).
d. When repeated 100 times you don't save your complete private key - save only last 5 digits of that private key. Write this down in a spreadsheet along with links to public keys to see how much money you saved.
Use generated 1 public key only for saving small amounts of money! The smaller amounts you use, more secure you'll feel that there's no way to withdraw such tiny amount.
If you want to put more money, for each deposit repeat all 4 steps mentioned to make sure that you have very small amounts in every locker you've created for money.
Each time you're using the same passphrase with different locker combinations. I recommend using no more than 4 digits at then end &amp; I recommend not memorizing them, because otherwise you'll have a temptation to do them.
At the moment of retirement you will be able to process all 9999 locker combinations in order to find all of your deposits. Let's say you're investing $5 per each deposit. 9999 * $5 = $49999. Yeah you may have temptation to redeem such amount now, but multiple wallets will make this process so tedious, that maybe you'll back up from doing that today. &amp; That's what you need.

I used these pathetic theoretical plastic cards my whole life because I'm a freelancer &amp; I need ability to transfer money internationally because its my main source of income.
I have Payoneer card &amp; many other useless pieces of plastic from other companies who offer the same services. Those are taking fixed fees for every transfer fee, withdrawal fee, annual fee, currency conversion fee.
Very often I have a problem checking balance. These piece of plastic coming from payoneer often have no chips (0 security). Payoneer's Internet banking is CRAP.
Once someone sent me money it takes around 7 days before I can basically withdraw that money (2-3 days for transaction to appear on my balance &amp; few days for transaction to clear).
Most of the International card providers take 4% fee for each transaction + fixed $3 ATM fee. Last time my mom sent me $96 &amp; after cashing out to rubles I received only $78.
2 years ago they freeze my funds for 2 months &amp; required me to send them my passport &amp; some other documents to confirm my identity (That's why it took 2 months).
If I'm losing my international card it usually takes not less than **60 days** to recover it.
Very cheap. Very convenient.

This is Social Wallet. Once someone is registered in your social wallet, they solve 2 problems - staying online during your contracts - through internal chat; automatically providing you Bitcoin Wallet, giving users ability to send payments without revealing their Bitcoin address (privacy settings will allow send your Bitcoins to anyone you want, but without ability to see their Bitcoin address [ changetip concept ]).
Your main idea is sharing. And I think its very important.
That's the basis of how social networks work today.
Concerning drugs &amp; other comments - how about creating blockchain.info - like model where creators of social-network don't see user content because its encrypted from them (but that would cause some problems with spammers, though this can be solved by votes against these spammer &amp; by some smart filtration).
Also my idea is creating the social network where you can tag your photos with transactions - e.g. you've made a photo with your smartphone, then you're using tagging tools to mark the transaction on the blockchain (and transaction line must be shown right bellow the photo with time stamp when transaction made, with graph where funds coming from &amp; other information)
Also it would be really cool to have a social tool where you can comment on the transactions made. I think this type of ideas can potential to make a social revolution!

Actually wanted to make some quick video (then I've found out that 6 minutes - is not so quick) about how I regularly save my Bitcoins.
Usually I use BitAddress.org Brain Wallet to create passphrase like "PassPhrase0000000001" then I generate my private key, then I use generated private key as the next passphrase &amp; then I use generated private key as the next passphrase &amp; then I use generated private key as the next passphrase &amp; then I use generated private key as the next passphrase &amp; then I use generated private key as the next passphrase &amp; I'm doing this 100 times in order to make sure that I will follow the same process in order to redeem my Bitcoins.
This type of stuff probably could be really efficient if you're saving by small amounts (e.g. $10 every day) - you can put $10 on a new Bitcoin address everyday, and all you need to know is your master passphrases &amp; their order, e.g. they can be PassPhrase0000000001, PassPhrase0000000002, PassPhrase0000000003, PassPhrase0000000004, PassPhrase0000000005.
Not opening anything new. Just wanted to share that this way of saving helps me save Bitcoins myself, because I don't need to rely on my power of will, because I can be pretty much sure that $10 isn't big enough amount to perform all those routine 100 private keys rephrasing on BitAddress Brain Wallet.

I'm not Andreas, but as far as I know, M Pesa isn't a currency - M Pesa initially was a cell-phone minutes. When people started using M Pesa minutes instead of their inflationary currency, that's when people start talking about M Pesa as of a currency.
Andreas always outlined that even if provider of M Pesa would be not 100% fair about their supply controls, at least those minutes was a better choice. If you would bring some enough amount of dollars to this country, then probably this dollars would fast enough to disappear under corruption/law enforcement &amp; other internal forces like Mafia which would take away the benefits of such currency. Plus I suppose nobody would even try. So when people left with choice M Pesa vs domestic useless currency, that's when M Pesa saved people's life. For those regions these people will never look at Bitcoin's volatility.
In future there's no guarantees that human laws like hyperinflation won't be broken. So that's the chance for Bitcoin to replace the currency of some countries.

"With the thing he cares the most about" - Bill Gates said about his friend who's didn't wanted to learn about the Internet, and he tried to convince him that Internet was useful with spreadsheets, emailing /etc, but he could get his attention only "With the thing he cares the most about" - when he played bridge over the Internet, that's when he found out that Internet is useful! That's why I believe variety of apps in Bitcoin is very important.
Also Bill Gates spoke a lot about the nature of Evangelism &amp; why he's so Evangelic about the Internet (Remember, the same word we're using to describe Bitcoin users)
When Bill Gates built the Microsoft products - it was mostly software products, and people mostly used the Microsoft's software (more than the Internet). &amp; hearing from Bill Gates the word "Internet" itself was unusual - for some people it was like Bill Gates is advertising some company for money again (yeah people actually thought that AT&amp;T &amp; other Internet companies were paying him for that. Also this is the same way currently Bitcoin users are treated - like we're members of some sort of MLM-structured companies where you get paid to bring new customers to the network, when you're talking about it. But if you're a true Bitcoiner, then only you know that mostly you're not gaining from talking, mostly you're investing without receiving any return)

also you don't know how Russia is good at instant irreversible payments. The only that thing is capable of connecting more users to Bitcoin, because users in Russia definitely don't get bothered by consumer protection (they don't know such word), and that opens opportunity for large P2P business! We have 150 million+ people in our country. And I believe we are the most open in terms of regulations for Bitcoin. Pres.Putin will love Bitcoin for the international capital.

When you're talking about central database, you're thinking only about your already developed coutnry. But your country having less problems than undeveloped poor countries. This kind of service could bring really enormous opportunities for poor countries in case if it will get mainstream. E.g. once this kind of thing is adopted for regular cheap stuff in 1 country, there's no restrictions for applying this type of transactions for selling huge objects like cars &amp; houses.
Once it becomes popular, this type of system has potential to replace current existing system, because existing systems around the world are corrupted - there is black real estate agents all around the world who's killing people &amp; modifying ownership records for the houses, this must be stopped.

I already dealed with WebMoney certification system, and I can say it solve most problems that is by its multisig and smart-contracts can't solve.

No, this network won't be any sort of IOU. This network can easily follow the mathematical rules too the same way Bitcoin does. The only difference is that this sort of network doesn't require miners &amp; it can be perfect for small corporate payment networks.

Fun fact: 90% of Russian economy is a shadow economy, e.g. I never seen anyone paying taxes from rent. Russian government don't depend from taxes, Russian government depend from oil sales. We live on dollarz &amp; yen yall.

In the world where every single little item assigned to someone, people will have better education on the way they can check item before buying it.
Yes I know most benefits will be gotten only if everybody accepted this type of system. But to me this is the next logical step in evolution.
Public keys engraved on item can help current authorities to identify you as real owner of this item - so its already can be useful for real world purposes. Right now only paper documents can prove that you are owning something, but 80% of items manufactured in the world don't have any paper documents, so thief easily can say that he bought it and very often there is no way to prove that you're a owned an item before it was stolen.

The point is that there's too much jurisdictions, and in case if some central authority will own that database, so this means that you can't sell your stuff globally, only within your country, because only your country can keep those types of records.
While blockchain makes the whole experiment global, and you can even send your item using OpenBazaar or other eBay-like stuff. In case if all U.S. manufacturers will use system like this, its not very long to wait when all the other hippity hoppity countries will join.

What a coincidence. Today morning (2015-03-06) my grand father passed away, unfortunately last years he was unable to talk normally, he spent most of his time in bed.  I had very few chances to have dialogue with him, of course I never tried to talk on topics of Bitcoin, but he's my grandfather (my Mom's father).
Right now my mother is living in U.S. and since grandfather is in Russia, she even won't be able to visit him to say final goodbyes to him. And not being disrespectful, but if only grandfather had a Bitcoin wallet, my mom could sent some money to grandfather and showing him some respect remotely. With what kind of asset you can do the same with the same ease?
To give summary of the topic:
- Bitcoin has better qualities than gold, because if you put gold into coffin, it creates incentive for bad actors to steal it away by disturbing the grave of deceased. And since there's no way to measure how much gold was in the coffin, throughout the history a lots of graves was robbed just because there could be gold.
- Since there's no way to measure how much gold in coffin, relatives can't even estimate how much money is included to the death of the people. But with Bitcoins the whole family can see how much Bitcoins is invested to 1 wallet, just by searching the passed away address on blockchain.
- Morals. When you're putting cash into coffin, religiously its a mistake. This type of ritual supposed to be holy. But how the rithual could be holy if you're not enriching the right people? When you're burning your cash - you're mostly enriching not the people, but those who're printing enormous amounts of that money. When you're burning your Bitcoins you're enriching the whole planet.

Through concensus mechanism. There should be some way for trustless cryptographical picking any ECDSA key from the addresses of existing list of transactions on the blockchain.
I think its reasonable to pick 100 candidates. Within 3 hours the candidates should start their signing node. Whoever among 100s selected can start their node, but only one of them will be starting their node faster than everybody else. This signing node will be signing blocks the same way the transactions messages are signed.

You're blaming Bitcoin for emission. Basically when algo in Bitcoin says, new Bitcoins are created.
And yes you are true that emission is unfair. But you don't get the whole point: in many countries yearly inflation is over 15% which means that local currency normal devaluation rates are 15% - that's an outstanding 15% of the whole country's economy! Give it 6 times (6 years) and you've created the same amount of money which already exists! And that's happening in 78% of the world! 
And now you're blaming that Bitcoin is doing some 1% or 2% of emission.
I think the only problem you have is math.

I will try to focus on this two categories:


- Creating your own merchant directory for local merchants who's concentrated geographically around your area. Many well-known classifieds web-sites, coupon web-sites and other types of online marketing aggregators are competing daily with each other and customers are used to this types of format of advertising. So
 - the more merchants on your directory
 - bigger it becomes, more people will visit it by recommendation from friends.


I don't know about anyone, but since Bitcoin is revolutionary itself, I'm looking not only for accepting Bitcoin, but for these things as well:
1) Making it quicker to buy using Bitcoin than with fiat money. E.g. 1-CLICK purchase on a web-site where you don't bore customer with filling ANY types of forms - I mean really creating a 1-CLICK service where all customer needs to know is how to transfer Bitcoin to the wallet &amp; everything else is handled for him.
2) Giving UNreal prices. Offering HUGE DISCOUNTS at least for some products. By HUGE I mean discounts like 80-90% of average market price, even if it means spending your own money. Again I don't talking about working absolutely for free, but from time to time few people could be creating wallets only to use this type of service. And as a user who never heard about Bitcoin in this case, I expect to develop long-term habit and you need to have this type of offers last for a very long (permanently).

Actually it was a joke.
But since I know basic math, I also know that no matter what operating system I use, my Bitcoins are safe if I'm using **cold storage**. By the way do you know what is the motto of one my favorite &amp; by the way popular web-site called oldversion.com

Yet telephone isn't perfect instant communication.
Even though I born in 1989, I socialized with some of my friends by using physical letters in a childhood. We sent letters because letters was cheaper than telephone. You can't express all your thoughts in a telephone conversation, because that would require expensive minutes.
The whole past century people wrote letters not because they had absolutely no access to telephones. You could purchase minutes by finding at least 1 available telephone in your city. But that was an expensive pleasure, and very often even telegram was less expensive than a phone call especially when it comes the calls even for such short distances as 500 miles.
So saying that telephone was an easy way to communicate is quite incorrect. Letters was good for expressing long thoughts and that telephones was good for the quick way of hearing the voice, but it was expensive. People understood this difference, and they knew that its a "fragmentation" - you had to use different forms of communications to accomplish different goals.
So yes. Physical letters was replaced by email. And physical cash was replaced by Bitcoin.
Western Union could be compared to sending telegrams. Checks could be compared to letters. PayPal could be compared to telephone (because you still can't send money anywhere with PayPal - only in U.S. and only in limited amounts - not big amounts, and not small amounts). 
In Russia our money is fragmented way too much: very often I run out of physical cash while I have virtual cash (sometimes I get my salary on services like WebMoney, QIWI, Sberbank and Yandex.Money) - I can't use my virtual cash to pay bus rides, and I can't use my virtual cash to buy the food. And very often it happens that I run out of virtual cash - and then I can't pay for my mobile phone, and I can't pay for any online services which is required to pay ISPs, web-hosting and even utils.
Converting virtual currency into cash is always a stupid long procedure in Russia. That's what I call fragmentation. People waist around few hours a day doing only that, and from my perspective its a **stupid** religious ritual and you have to pay from 1,5% to 5% just to keep moving your money from virtual currency to physical cash and vice versa.

They will check ownership history, when it will be easy.
When it comes to every purchase, very often people get suspicious, where it comes from. There's nothing difficult scanning QR-code using smartphone then checking that scanned QR address match with engravings.
I won't buy your TV if you refuse showing me documents. In Russia (my country) people asking for documents when they purchase anything every single time! (Most often for the phones - because phones are the often subject for stealing and police in Russia can confiscate your phone if you are unable to show them purchase documents - ask anyone from Russia)
I've seen many want to know whether items are not stolen before purchasing used stuff, and they will demand such system once they find out that such thing is existing &amp; its up to them to use it or not. People may find this even more useful than Bitcoin.
