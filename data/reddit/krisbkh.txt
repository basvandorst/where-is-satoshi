Okay, so on your paper wallet you’ll have 2 QR codes (they look a bit like barcodes). One is you public key which is the address where people can send you bitcoin. The second is your private key (I can’t emphasise the word private enough). This can be used to export your wallet (I.e. your bitcoin) to another wallet. Basically you’ll need to find  another wallet (preferably an app) which will allow you to scan that private key and transfer your paper wallet to the new wallet on your phone/laptop etc.......
Maybe try the App Store, be careful not to confuse your wallet with a bitcoincash wallet. Once you do this then you’ll be able to transfer to Coinbase.
With that said, the fees at the moment may decimate your $15 so my advice would be to just leave everything as is. Maybe even take a photo of your wallet and hide it somewhere

I didn’t insinuate anything, it’s an actual fact! My point really is that, in the meantime, the powers that be in India are sat debating if they should ban crypto’s. When “on average” several children would have been raped, and possibly murdered, during their trivial debate.

No love, the value of gold is intrinsic and is only worth what people will pay for it based on its scarcity. BTC has the same property other than we know how many BTC will be created unlike gold as we have no clue whatsoever how much of it is in the ground. In the next few years you will have 300 million millionaires fumbling around to grab one of a few million BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-28 20:59:11
I bought in a £3.5k then a few days later Jamie Dimon made his speech about BTC being a scam and it dropped down to just over £2k. Man i was sick!!! But I held and still do......I watched BTC from it being £1500 always asking the question "should I buy in now" and never did. Biting the bullet when I did only to see it decimate in a matter of days was tough but I'm glad I did.....just hope the post puts it into perspective for people waiting to jump on.

There'll be some serious mutha fuckery happening in New York from Monday in order to drive the price down and there's one thing I would never do and that's underestimate the sheer greed that sits within a place like Wall Street. 
I genuinely believe that there will be a serious attempt to sabotage the price of BTC in the short term which will have a good chance at being successful........
Do not be surprised if the price plummets from Monday just hodl and ride it out.

Everyone will want ID to transfer fiat to BTC as it comes with risks to the sellers if you go off and start using it for weird, inappropriate shit which ironically you can do with cash anyway but no bankers get their collar pinched for that. You still get in shit for it

@_date: 2017-12-28 20:27:17
At this moment in time BTC is beyond the conventions of a currency and moving into the same realms as gold. You wouldn't take a block of gold in to a restaurant and start chipping pieces off when it comes to settle your bill. You wouldn't buy coffee with a piece of gold nor would you pay your barber with it......
And the fact the some of the worlds major financial institutions want in on this is a little bit more than "just" speculation as you put it.

Mate, do you think people who hold gold give a fuck about the fact you can make fucking jewellery out of it? Noooooo!!!! They hold it because it's scarce and has high intrinsic worth. They can sell it for cash and buy other things with it......not because it doesn't rust or because you can mould it into fucking pretty shapes hahahahahahaha
Thanks though, that made me actually LOL

No, Coinbase purposely held off on implementing segwit during a time when public interest was at its highest. Millions of people jammed the network after buying small amounts worth of BTC from Coinbase and attempted to withdraw their funds to a different wallet. Some noobs where being drawn into to buying small amounts thinking the gains would be astronomical.
CB did this on purpose because they are bcash whores and wanted BTC to fall over. Their CEO was in favour of bx2 which if you remember fell flat on its ass. It was an attempt to disrupt the BTC blockchain in an effort to kill it......
It failed

I very much doubt that is the case, you would have had to have a very deep understanding of cryptography, programming, economics and finance in order to create something as complex as bitcoin and the blockchain right from the ground up.
I personally doubt that 1) Nakamoto was 1 person  and 2) they not only knew about bitgold, they would have had to have been involved with its conception.

Bitcoin may not last that long, it may not even last to the end of the year. We need adoption and recognition. We need average joe to understand why he needs Bitcoin.
We simply cannot give a fuck about what happened in a 120 years because there’s far too much for us to do in the present......

Lots of people made lots of predictions. By the balance of probability someone will be correct at least once.
Just because this guy predicted $3k doesn’t mean he’s right about $100k
Even John McAfee’s made a few correct predictions. He’s also betting he’ll eat his own cock if BTC doesn’t hit something ridiculous like $500k by next year!

I cringe when I see people asking for “mass adoption”
I don’t think we’ll ever see “mass adoption” in the same way Visa has been adopted. Then again, we don’t need to!
No one buys coffee, cinema tickets or their weekly shop with gold. Yet it has a $7 trillion market cap. 
If BTC equals the same value then 1 BTC will be worth around $500k! And I bet then we’ll still be no way near “mass adoption” in the way people view it.
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:56:36
I honestly don’t trust this guy!
Call me cynical but If I invested LOTS of money in companies like Coinbase THEN it makes absolutely perfect sense to spread the word that BTC will impact industries in the way he describes.
There’s NO way this guy knows what BTC will be doing is 1, 3, 5, 10 years from now NO WAY.....Yet every time is see his face it usually has $100k Bitcoin in the tagline or 100X bigger than the internet.......
If this guy was just a HODLER then I’d be quite excited about the prospect of someone so successful spreading the word BUT this guy isn’t just a HODLER he’s personally invested in methods that average joes can buy BTC which is a conflict in my eyes.

It was never about block size increase, it was about the manner in which the block size was being increased. This was going from people outside of the BTC Core Dev team and they were essentially refusing to implement replay protection by trying to buy the onus on core. Basically whoever implements replay protection is the forked coin.
This was an attempt to hijack bitcoin itself. The block size increase may happen in the future but under better circumstances

I wouldn't trust Coinbase, they support the NYA so I'm very cynical that there dealings will be integral when it's comes to exchanging BTC for bx2.
As far as I'm aware they have stated that each Coinbase account will be credited an equal amount of bx2 for BTC but I haven't found anything which confirms what state your BTC will be in once you try to sell bx2
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:26:48

1) Buy 1 BTC
2) Buy Ledger Nano
3) Buy Safe
4) Move 1 BTC to Ledger Nano

7) Set reminder to check safe in 2030
8) Forget steps 1-7 ever happened

But it is, it’s their platform and their business reputation at stake. If you owned a streaming service they you would want users to have a good experience so they keep coming back. Not to be bombarded with inaccurate information.

I’m going to make 2 predictions, mark my words now. These 2 predictions WILL happen based on my logical approach to bitcoin and its chart history.
1) Bitcoin will go up; and
2) Bitcoin will go down
This will happen continuously!

Don’t forget after they bought everyone’s gold at $21 an ounce they then raised the price of gold to $35 an ounce meaning a lot of people lost out on a lot of money!
@_date: 2019-12-19 10:35:08
Is it “manipulation” or are they just selling their mined BTC to pay for overheads?

Don’t be surprised if we dip hard in the coming weeks
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:10:03
Scam? Imagine for a minute how many scammers target a crypto exchange such as binance!
They’re not scamming you, they’re trying to protect you! What if you’re a hacker who now wants to take full control over the account and use it for laundering.
How else are they supposed to protect you and themselves?
It’s like changing your address with your bank. You have to go in and sign a sheet to confirm you are you.
Get a grip man and give them what they want, or don’t!

@_date: 2018-02-12 19:15:31
I would personally wait for trezor to launch the wallets which support the forked coins. The fact that they havent launched a bitcoin diamond wallet yet indicates that they are not yet satisfied enough with Bitcoin Diamonds transparency. I hold BTC on a ledger and don’t really give a shit about other forked coins which ledger don’t currently support. When they do my coins will be there waiting.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:23:20

@_date: 2017-10-17 21:32:22
You need to be certain that you have these. If you don't then technically you don't even own your own BTC never mind any potential hard forked coin.
If not you can transfer to a paper wallet or buy a hardware wallet.
I would check the support section if your wallet provider and clarify where to acquire your private keys.

I might be wrong here so please anyone correct me but i think in layman’s terms it packets transactions together in order for them to be mined quicker meaning coins are sent to destinations faster

Why are people asking about moving coins "to" Coinbase?? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:47:30
Great idea 
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:42:58
Okay, Technically bitcoin isn't made from "nothing" i believe it's costing approximately  $1000 to mine 1 bitcoin at the moment and if you don't have the correct equipment to compete then your chances of mining a bitcoin at all is precisely 0%.
The technology that bitcoin sits on top of essentially allows bitcoin to govern itself. So even if bitcoin was a "scam" no one would profit from it, no one could profit from it. It's not some kind of pyramid scheme where you have to recruit so many investors. It's a currency. Just like the £, the $, the € or the ¥. The difference is it's not controlled or distributed by governments or much worse banks. This is where people have a hard time coming to the realisation that yes this is a legitimate currency and yes at this moment in time it has real value.

@_date: 2017-10-15 11:40:29
1) I have the same query regarding this so I choose "I don't know" option. 2) The ledger Nano s stores you private keys without the need to access them. This keeps them safe however there is a section on the ledger site which tells you how to access these. Personally, I wouldn't just incase.....3) the x2 hardfork is a bit different from the bitcoin cash hardfork. The August hard fork had strong replay protection. This x2 bullshit doesn't and is an attempt to hijack core. I'm not technical so it's took me a couple of weeks to wrap my head around. Basically the guys in the New York agreement have refused to to integrate this so it's a bit of a mess. A guy called jimmy song has wrote a few blogs about this so look him up.

At the end of the day, it will be the large corporations that will decide whether crypto is adopted not the governments.
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:24:22
What is the reasoning behind all this? BTC seems to be thriving at the moment it all seems quite risky

Give $12k for 1btc
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:49:35
Okay, definitely keep your coins of Coinbase. If a hard fork come which replay protection then they will keep your coins as they did in the bitcoin cash fork. At least bittrex had some integrity but while your coins are on an exchange technically they are not your coins.
The bitcoin gold fork is going to have replay protection from what I've read. This bx2 bullshit doesn't and is a disgrace some people have been able to code there wallets to protect them but I wouldn't have a clue where to start with that.
Long story short, transfer your coins to a paper wallet. If you hold more than a few hundred dollars buy a hardware wallet. Just make sure you have your private keys.......
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:06:46
That's crazy! There's no way one person can be Satoshi Nakamoto. Nick Zsabo and co started bitcoin......he even started a business in the late 90's called "bitgold" which used similar aspects to bitcoin

@_date: 2019-09-04 14:58:28
This is painful to read! At the end of the day you should only buy what you can afford to lose and realise that the swings are massive. Literally your investment could be worth 50% less than what you paid in just a few weeks.
If you buy in at $10k today and the Mrs asks you how much the price is next month and it’s $6k. How will that go down? If it’s going to cause tension, frustration and confusion then you need to abort this idea.
At least educate her and what it is and the price trends over the last few years.

Depends how much you have. I left around $300 on bittrex during the August HF and everything was fine. Bittrex credited my Bitcoin cash a few days later.
In reality it needs to be offline on a paper wallet

I’m not sure the ETF’s will be giving the green light this time round due to lack of regulation and the communities inability to stop manipulation in the market!
However, as some whose held just a shade over 1 BTC since Sep 1st 2017. If ETF’s do go live then it’s Paaaarteeeyyyy time mutha fucka’s!!!!!!

Do your research, understand what crypto is before you start throwing your money about. Learn about Bitcoin, where to buy it, how to manage your wallets etc.......
Don’t be getting caught up in the FOMO, especially of some shit coin like Libra.

Isn’t their physical evidence suggesting that this guy got into a negotiation with what he believed was a hitman and offered to pay them to kill people?
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:48:57
Well I don’t understand why people want him freed. He transferred funds to an individual under the proviso that a target would be killed. It sounds like people are saying that because no one was killed he shouldn’t be incarcerated but it kind of reminds me of these pedophile hunters who pose as young kids online to lure in sex offenders. These pedo’s get sentenced not because they have committed a physical sexual assault on a minor but because they had the intention of doing so and acting under the belief that they were grafting a child for sex.
What amazes me about Ross is that he’s managed to become one of the most dangerous criminals over night with fucking ZERO experience in being an actual organised criminal.

@_date: 2017-10-22 20:20:26
Coinbase won't give you the steam off their piss! Worst case scenario shift your BTC to bittrex if your ledger doesn't turn up in time. At least they will credit you the shitty BTG coin.......alternatively you can paper wallet your BTC however I don't know how that works once we pass block 491407

@_date: 2017-10-28 12:28:54
You'll pay $85 for a ledger and the wait time is about 2-3 weeks. If $200 is the most your going for the stick with paper, laminate them and stash them somewhere safe. However if you're adding an amount monthly then go for it.

I’ve posted something similar to this after I read a book called bitcoin, the future of money by a guy called Dominic frisby. He summaries perfectly why Satoshi is an entity of several people and concludes that the leader would most likely have been Nick Szabo but he then struggles to fully commit to this statement because he was unable to find any physical code wrote by Nick which he wanted to compare to the original BTC code.

So if there are Muslims which live in non Arab states then why couldn’t a large group of British Muslims pump the price of bitcoin?

You’ll never know when the next peak is. BTC could rally to $20k and you sell thinking that’s the top only for it to jump up to $30k and sit there for 3 years.
People who have tried what your implying have lost a lot of money

There’s no way this narcissist is SN! If he invented BTC like he says he did. He would have been singing it from the fucking hill tops right from the second he sent his first transaction to Hal Finney.

Honestly, if I read another post about Satoshi Nakamoto and who he/she is or isn’t. I’m gonna blow my fucking brains out......
I hold a decent amount of BTC and literally couldn’t give a gram of shit about who the creator of BTC is.
I’m too interested in where BTC is heading over which sweaty ass dev created it.
Fuck Satoshi Nakamoto!

The price won’t go to zero now, the genie is out of the bottle now and too many people buy the fucking dip.
It’s like saying gold, oil or real estate will go to zero. No it won’t because the minute the house market dips 20% you’ll get investors jumping in to get a fifth off the price of that condo they’ve been eyeing up.
Then you have the price of mining costs.
If you lose your private keys then it’s tough shit. Take extra precautions and have a contingency should anything happen.

Hats of to you sir!!!
What about things like insurances etc? Did you have any joy convincing financial companies to accept? I think that'll be the key turning point
