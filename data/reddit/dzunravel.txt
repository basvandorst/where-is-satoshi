I have small amount of BTC still sitting over there that I tried to withdraw eight days ago...  still pending.
Put in a support ticket six days ago, two days later the support response gave some vague BS to the effect of "our BTC withdrawal system is really complicated, please standby while we figure out how to make it work."
Not expecting to ever see the BTC ever again.
edit:  the day after I wrote this post, I attempted to withdraw several million DOGE, and the transaction occurred in less than three minutes, so this changes my opinion about the whole situation.  Maybe there actually is something going on other than blatant theft.  Don't get me wrong, they need to get that BTC withdraw shit fixed ASAP, but it's hardly an MTGOX situation yet.

One user does not a userbase make.  Srsly.  There's like 50,000 people actively posting in that subreddit.  Taking a post and saying "they" while referencing that community is a pretty sweeping extrapolation and generalization you are implying...  especially when every other user in that thread jumped down the guy's throat for being dumb.

The strength of bitcoin has never been and will never be its price.
If you're looking for get-rich-quick schemes here, it's no wonder you're disappointed.
