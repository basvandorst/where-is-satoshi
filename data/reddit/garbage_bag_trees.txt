You should warn them of the dangers of cash, and all the illegal activities associated with that, too.

True, but that fact won't stop people from trying.

I laughed. And then I stopped and realized that it's not impossible.

This is how you know that Bitcoin news is reaching a mainstream audience.
@_date: 2016-04-03 21:13:51
With Bitcoin, it's out in the open. There are probably already organizations dedicated to tracking money laundering and tax evasion done through Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-01 13:19:30
It's not a scam to, just to the people who had their credit cards stolen. Criminals can launder their money by buying keys in poorer regions of the world where the price is lower, and then reselling them to you online.
Of course, there's no guarantee that Bethesda or other companies won't realize that those are fraudulent payments, and invalidate the keys to discourage such activity.

My thoughts exactly. Seems like everyone is ganging up on them these days, but if they do more cool things like this then I kind of hope for a lighter touch with Senate reform.

It even says in the article that Buffet is somewhat biased against technology, and that he doesn't always understand it. Although the fact that he refers to to Bitcoin as a medium of transfer makes it seem like he's done a bit of research at least.
EDIT: Worth mentioning, Warren Buffet is a wizard of common sense, and investing in bitcoin is inherently risky, so there's that too.
@_date: 2014-12-26 22:08:03
If he ever invested in a bitcoin company, it would be because he thought it might help people, not because he expected a return. He understands enough to know that it can be used as a medium of exchange, but I doubt he trusts any other of its applications

Clearly, this is the GOP's fault
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:50:11
It is possible, but he/she would be doing it to test something different altogether. Maybe to see if anyone would make that connection, or maybe just to see if it gets sarutobi any extra publicity.
The intent would have been different than with a stolen credit card. When you have a stolen card, that gives you access to currency. When you have bitcoin in your wallet, nobody can restrict your access to it.

One thing that actual bitcoin and actual gold have in common? They're both difficult to use as bookmarks. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:39:38
Yes. Don't ask me how I know that.

My sarcasm meter is almost barely registering, as well.

I've never dealt with PC financial, but I've seen them in grocery stores. Is that even technically a bank? Or just a sort of credit card system?

Put this in your boot script, so you can be sure it will be run at least once every couple of years.

High profile PR agencies like this tend to avoid working for blatant liars. Assuming they were paid for their services, this still hurts them too.

But I thought Putin was a dictator...

No, he just got in his Delorean and returned to the future.
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:43:14
It sounds like he didn't have a way to publicly prove that he is Satoshi, and so saying that he would move coins was just a stalling tactic. The pay off for this farce is that he will have many people who still believe in him on an emotional basis rather than a logical one, and so he will be able to get money from them in further confidence scams.

Oh look it's this thread again.
Craig Wright is an Australian professor who claimed/implied earlier in 2014 to be Satoshi Nakamoto.
More recently, he went to Gavin Andreasen and several other Bitcoin Foundation members, had them sign NDAs, and then showed them proof on an allegedly untampered computer.
Several days ago, he went public, and also posted a script to verify his "proof". The "proof" was shown to actually just be a duplication of a transaction made by Satoshi long ago, and was not an original message by Wright.
Wright's claim continued to be supported, in particular by the BF members that had signed his NDA. But many people attacked his position saying that if he were Satoshi, he should be able to sign something with the signature of the genesis block, or one of the very early block like Block 9. Block 9 comes up as a block that was provably associated with an transaction between Hal Finney and Satoshi, the first known transaction between two people.
Instead of signing anything, Wright publicly stated that in the coming days he would move some early coin to demonstrate that he was Satoshi. But just today, he took down his blog and posted a message to the effect that he is no longer willing to provide proof, and good bye. And that's where we're at now.
To editorialize a bit: I don't think it should really matter who the real Satoshi is. Satoshi coins make up an expected 7% of all bitcoin, which is enough to initiate a possible market collapse. As long as that coin remains in one spot, it's not really a huge deal who the real Satoshi is, and ANYONE (not just slimy characters like Wright) who comes along claiming to be Satoshi is probably a scammer. But in a system like Bitcoin, authority is meaningless and crypto is everything.

Well, until you get to the point where they are at in venezuala because they can't even afford to keep printing money, because it's so worthless.

Every currency is volatile to some degree. Bitcoin will be used this way if/when it becomes less volatile than the USD.
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:06:23
You're right. You got us. It turns out, we thought he was a mathematical computer wiz who could perform basic actions that any first year computer science student could do, like prove his identity through public key encryption. Such lofty fantasies of our saviour that are apparently false.

Crashing an app is the first sign that more complex exploits are possible. If an attacker can figure out why a vuln causes a crash, they can figure out how to make it do something other than crash.
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:08:50
The unfortunate thing, some people will still believe he is Satoshi, and he will find ways to take advantage of them, too.
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:18:48
Only one that we know of. Satoshi could have had many addresses, we just don't know what they all are.

That would be kind of a dick move though. If he wasn't Dorian but claimed to be, it would ruin Dorian's life in so many ways.

As many people have already said, this wouldn't have happened if Evolution supported multi-sig as a primary payment option. Multi-sig //was// an option, but it required your bitcoin to go to be held by Evolution before the multi-sig payment, so it was almost like a fake multi-sig. Pretty disingenuous of them to even have it as an option.

Bitlocker is far from the 'trust no-one' full disk encryption solution that Truecrypt had strived to be. It is extremely unlikely that their recommendation was sincere.

The rumor is that it's Satoshi. He apparently even drew it himself.

Same here. I've been interested in Bitcoin back in the days when people were trying to talk their pizza delivery guys into accepting bitcoin. I first heard about it through a podcast called Security Now!. I was a poor student at the time, and didn't bother to get involved. I really wish I had at least gotten some free bitcoin from the bitcoin faucets, at least. To think I could be a millionaire now if I had gone all in. :(

They update Prison Architect pretty regularly. They post long videos on YouTube with every update. They treat it like a podcast, and it's pretty amusing.
