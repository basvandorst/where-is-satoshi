I mean, it literally is tax evasion...
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:42:51


No he literally is a criminal.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:40:51
So, tax evasion?

Who would win: 
A currency with a market capitalisation of billions of dollars
Some fucking autists who like cats.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:32:49
It takes 5 blocks to confirm a transaction, idiot.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:49:00
Dude ran a drug trafficking and document forging ring, nah he can rot.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:32:04
...A bank?

I would say that the RSPCA  is a great cause and unlike scumbag organisations like PETA they genuinely try to alleviate animal cruelty in a realistic manner.

Steve Jobs was a scumbag though...

Microsoft makes more contributions to Google's code projects than any other company, AFAIK

Legit question but why not use a vanity address? 1PBoy**** would take seconds.

Except it's Ver who's literally scamming people...
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:51:44
Funny meme.
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:02:29
It's not a hardfork of the blockchain though, is it?
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:22:56
Controlled inflation prevents people from just stockpiling money and never spending it, and ensures that money cannot be destroyed. Bitcoin does neither of those things. This meme is retarded.
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:03:55
How is Verge not top of that list of shitcoins, it's the biggest scam in crypto I've ever seen.
It's a shitty fork of a meme coin and the devs are totally incompetent.
They pushed a hardfork without realising it.
@_date: 2018-06-02 13:40:49
Call me up when a cryptocurrency can handle 24,000 instant transactions per second without requiring a hard drive the size of a small moon.

"Kind and free"
Aside from the drug and arms smuggling, and attempted murder...
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:19:46
Facilitating drug and arms smuggling, sounds like a great guy...
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:35:01
Does your hat come in anodised aluminium colour?
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:17:53


Gonna be a hard deny, a 1080 pulls around £2.50/d whilst using 180W, using about 4.3kWh/d, which is at most £0.50
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:22:25
Profits are down 50% from early January, though that's mainly due to Bitcoin popping than anything else.
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:29:21
Okay but it's not insider trading because Bitcoin isn't a stock... 
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:13:04
0.000001 BTC has been deposited in your account.
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:22:53
Drung and arms smuggling and attempted murder, no he should have life without parole...
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:16:59
Rot in prison you criminal scum, on what planet is drug smuggling and illegal arms dealing cause for celebration...
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:35:44


@_date: 2018-02-15 11:17:51


Downvoted and reported.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:21:05
Altcoins still generate far more profit than their electricity costs.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:48:03
CS suffers horribly below 100, the game is so twitchy that you need as low a latency as possible
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:15:13
40FPS is unplayable, especially in CS:GO
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:44:23
Did you miss that? A girl paid a guy to ghostwrite a cryptocurrency tracker app and then got a women in tech (prize?) for doing so
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:53:52
You can't "take" bitcoin anywhere, only your private key, just like you can for a bank account.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:05:02
Oh, never seen it, yeah probably best known for that then.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:58:20
Then get an account offshore in somewhere with favourable laws, like literally everyone else. Meanwhile Bitcoin is subject to exorbitant fees and a public ledger.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:47:31
Doesn't an S9 put out 14TH whilst using 300W less? AKA this board is less efficient whilst being on a smaller node?
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:13:53
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:10:37
No it isn't.
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:53:18
C'mon, an actor best known for playing a criminal mastermind with a history of deceiving the police? Totally not a scam bois.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:20:05
So fuck all real world gain despite being on a node less than half the size.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:05:42
I prefer Bcancer
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:05:37
That's idiotic, there's nothing stopping me from creating my own "security" and enacting racial genocide if I so desire.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:23:46
I do it stealthily, who's gonna pay the security to investigate?
