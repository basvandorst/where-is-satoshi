Take away 11 years and you've hit the nail on the head.

What a shame, I'm normally away at all the events I want to go too, but so far I've had some luck! Xbox One last week, PS4 this week and also BTC Expo London!

I showed my girlfriend silkroad before I told her that I was mining bitcoins... That was an interesting few days.
BTW, I don't use silkroad, it just interests me :)

Can't wait, should be a good one!
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:25:25
Should be a fun one, I hope to see you there!
I know, I paid in cash as I had some funds left over in my PayPal which I wanted to spend.
Saving my Bitcoins.

Would be good to meet you! Have you got a table set up or are you just mingling?

So pricey compared to BFL!!
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:34:36
I hope so. I'll buy you a beer and drink it on your behalf.

Focus Butterfly Labs, you have Bitcoin Miners to build!

OP will deliver, he must :'(
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:43:43
I'm guessing that's theoretically?
@_date: 2013-05-17 14:47:57
Yeah, have an upvote. I would tip you but I have no idea what I'm doing.
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:44:12
Okay, but still, thoughts?
