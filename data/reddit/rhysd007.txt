It's a solution if your problem is paying high fees!

It *has* appeared on Coinbase. Now people can buy it, pushing up its value. It's cheaper than BTC so no0bs may buy BCH instead (seeing the green similar logo), again pushing up its value.  
People can't yet sell it on the exchange. Most hodlers are worried that there is some shadyness going on, where the people behind Coinbase/GDAX are manipulating the price of BCH so they can dump at a premium ahead of everyone else.   
Will be interesting to watch...!

subsidised by the larger fees for similar transactions on sister site Coinbase

allowed the app to access your camera?

using Coinbase to transfer BTC.... Use the GDAX backend and you pay 0% fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:44:27
yeh, but subsidised by their Coinbase fees
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:41:24
sent -1 BTC, enjoy :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:40:26
it costs them to send it, why would they not charge a fee? Transfers to GDAX are free
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:25:08
0% means you don't pay fees. GDAX/Coinbase are paying the fees. Everyone isn't doing it because they don't know about it/ know how.

Does anyone have a list of old Bitcoin wallets online? I remember mining for about a month back in the day but can't remember where I stored the coins! None of the previously mentioned in this thread ring a bell. 
Thanks in advance
