is it possible to exchange money on the card into bitcoin like on e-coin website? I can't find the option in the android app.

can anyone explain in simple terms how this work? How will a "wallet" know that it has received a payment?

I hve done it with XAPO nd BIT-X debit cards. But both have major issue. Xapo take a very long time (about 14 days) and Bit-x took about 5 days for me but there was a 5% fee which is huge. Hope wirex is better. Will try it soon

if I choose sha, then will I pay only my bank fees ?
@_date: 2016-03-24 05:52:25


Yes with bit-x
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:12:14
It has been implemented by some miners only

What wallet has this feature?
I remember seeing this as well but can't remember with which wallet
@_date: 2016-01-29 11:19:08
Yes, that's true with the seed. Electrum uses 13 words. But shouldn't it work with multisig wallet? Because here it is the xpriv and xpub which are being (BIP32) not the seed. Or am I missing something here?

what to you mean? 
@_date: 2016-03-16 19:23:21
probably a ddos attack
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:10:37
That's seem great. Will it be possible to send SEPA transfers as well?
@_date: 2016-02-10 06:38:15
Useless post
@_date: 2016-02-26 03:57:09
glad to hear it
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:24:52
I mean that unlike trezor and ledger, I cannot use bitlox wallet with third-party wallets like coinkite, mycelium, electrum ....
Hope this change soon though
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:26:28
damn that's sucks. There should be some kind of standards between wallets or at least a way of changing them.

no way you're gonna find a bitcoin atm in cuba. Bitcoin atm do not even exist in many countries. If you want to pay with bitcoin you can try to get a bitcoin debit card from a provider outside the US like xapo, wagecan, cryptopay, e-coin etc... You should however check whether visa or mastercard will work there ( Tripadvisor says that non us visa card will work. And mastercard releases  a statement a year ago stating that it will allow cuba to use their service.
Bring some fiat with you to be on the safe and tell us if the card work if you decide to use one

This was the case with version 1.2 and prior version. Now they are using BIP44 (root m/48')
@_date: 2016-02-26 16:41:56
was hoping to have a multisig feature on the android which could be use as a second factor authentication
@_date: 2016-02-24 05:21:36
Unfortunately it does not work with third-party wallet like trezor and ledger

I am trying to create an account, but when I click subscribe, nothing happen excepts that all the field become blank. 
Also will it include features like receiving and sending wire/sepa transfer?

What documents do they required for verification? Do they ask for ssn?
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:15:11
I don't think so. As soon as mtgox start selling its btc the price will decrease. 200 000 btc is a lot and they won't be able to sell the coin for $2000 each
