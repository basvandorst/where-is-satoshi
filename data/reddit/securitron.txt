I like this Pierre guy.

This is my first step when doing anything. Worked out pretty well so far.

With the amount of money flowing through cryptos, there's much to be gained by manipulating the minds of the masses with repetitive messaging. It takes people with good mental b s detectors to see through it, to remember that 2x and BCH have some very bad, even hostile actors backing them. Throughout history, people have done the most vile, cruel things they are physically and mentally capable of just to gain or maintain a bit of power.

Thanks to all the testers helping find bugs!

Pretty scathing, but clear.
I feel we are witnessing history in the making this month.

I respect that level of maturity. Take an upvote.

Installed, thanks for the link!

Won't it pretty much be a non-event since BIP148 does (I think) about the same thing as BIP91? Excuse my lack of education on this subject if I'm woefully incorrect.

If the 2x part somehow becomes the rational and more logical path forward, then yes. Currently, no.

I'm not sure how that bot works, sounds like you may have had to sign up with something that gives you a wallet so that the bot can gift you the BTC.

After more research, it seems that Bitcoin cash (ABC) forks 40 mins before the UASF date on Aug 1st [source]( I'd guess that's the actual event, watching BCH fail to become a thing.

What percentage were they formerly at?

How is it not a hostile takeover? You have miners that can cheaply get mining asics that cheat the system (mining empty blocks) and they enforce their patent on those chips so nobody else can do the same, then they use that hash power to block a very helpful update that benefits everyone else. Also, bip148 _might_ create a fork which would fix itself through a reorg later if it turned out the majority of blocks were bip148. The 2x nya _WILL_ create a fork if it goes through. Also if the code for the 2x blocksize increase comes from the same people who made BU, it's probably going to be buggy as hell and they'll have to do a roll back anyway.

I think I'm not getting a reference to something.
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:49:45
The idea is to prevent it from being taken over by hostile miners.

I've only read the first part of that article, and there are some neat sounding ideas there (at least on the surface), but BitcoinXT / UL both have such a negative stigma attached to them brought on by the perception of why they were created, that it overshadows this whole "sidechain" concept. Some would even say that Bitcoin XT / UL were created to attempt to hijack the currency away from its current trend of decentralization and centralize control of it around just a few individuals.
