Doesn't matter to me, just thought it was funny.  My coins aren't going anywhere for a while.

Always called my step mom "Mom" growing up so my mother ended up that way in my phone.  I don't actually call her that.  My brother on the other hand does though and mostly certainly could be compared to Norman Bates.

No worries man, I don't post often so I dont mind a little back and forth.  Was up on a late 6 hour emergency call for work anyways... (I work in IT so no human emergency,  just a stubborn server!)

I'm flattered you think this is fake!

I mean she owns stocks?  Do you really think no mother would ever use that verbiage?  Ever?
Seems like a ridiculous statement.

I'm not sure if this is serious or not, but if it is it's rather amusing!

She most certainly did.  I actually just texted her saying that despite that tweet, it's up 4%.  Not that itll only go up from here but just that Bitcoin does it's own thing and doesn't always behave as you'd expect.

No need for the reasoning, everyone loves a good joke.

I am on the latest firmware and this story scared the shit out of me.  Went to check my wallet this morning and everything is there no issues.  May move funds elsewhere until this is sorted out.  Keep us in the loop.  Sorry for your loss.

Trezor One.  Used the only method I know how to update, plug it in with both buttons pressed.  Web update from wallet.trezor.io.  I did not get the Bitcoin only firmware, as I used all default options.

Awesome initiative!
