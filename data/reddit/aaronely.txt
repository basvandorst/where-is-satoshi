Bitcoin will get manipulated, there will just no longer be a central bank that can create limitless amounts of it to manipulate markets with... That's where the current system is really messed up... Markets will always be manipulated... But have unlimited quantities at your disposal to do so is ridiculous...

.. But maybe holding onto our money is a responsibility we should all uphold to ourselves... Lol... Same goes for keeping others from taking it. Stand up and learn how to fight. But who wants individual accountability? Wed actually have to do real work...Lol
