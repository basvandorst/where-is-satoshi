Because Bitcoin didnt mind his stance to the outside world. It has grown to sloppy to fast. Now we are thrown back three years and hope for another glooming on the horizon.

Bitcoins potential is enormous. Everybody can begin on  his own and trademark it. If we believe as humans we can make the right decisions as a consumer bitcoin is a great product. If not bitcoin is a big fail. It also is a solution for privacy issues where governments and orgs are stealing our information for free. Let them pay for it. It's my information! Instead of let me read a kind of shady disclaimers. If every market has his own coin this will br become some sort of fund people agree to invest in. Insurances are not needed anymore then and are medieval.

I disagree the great power of crypto is multiple coins for different groups under an economy. On the other hand I think altcoins should be connected more to fiat and not to bitcoin. However it could be that bitcoin is as just as dependable on alt coins as alt coin on bitcoin.

It’s an alt licking pump orchestrated by exchanges to kill shorts and get some achievements to attract new investors. Whales over whales. It will also drop hard.

Although Crypto is going in the wrong direction this year. Still to volatile. Not user friendly enough and criminal activities, the biggest problem seems to grow and the mainstream hears of this phishing, ransom ware and dark web activities. There were also a few coins this year that have a high amount of total coins, worth nothing and rose very high. Like bytecoin and digibyte. This only means the value of crypto increasingly doesn't account for the fiat spend in it. Bitcoin needs to be critical of itself if its needs to survive. It's a wonderful opportunity for mankind.

On the spot he seems a gentle men. Normal and down to earth, enjoys life. but the more I read about him the more I think he's bad news. Like shedding people with enormous dogs and punish those who want them gone is not normal
Behaviour. It more like Ramsay Bolton. I am not gonna invest in Ramsay Bolton. But i think Jihan Wu is still a Nov person for sure. I am not sure about roger.
