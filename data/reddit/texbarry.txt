I know you're half kidding, but just know that the student loan problems in America are largely the students' fault.
Yes, many schools are WAY more expensive than they need to be. But you can get a college education much cheaper if you don't go to the school that dumps all of their money into their college football program.

People fail to see this. Even if the government is paying, you're still paying. Nothing is free.

Go away with that shit.

Ok, so when I use my debit card at the gas pump and they place a $100 hold on funds for $20 of gas... I should put Joe Mobil under citizens arrest eh?

You sound like somebody who has watched Fight Club too many times and have a brand new account. I feel like you're just trolling at this point.

This was me at 10k last week. I bought, and am now +33%. Who knows man.

I don't know how accurate that is. Does that take into account VAT? We don't have a federal sales tax.
And while I agree we could definitely stand to spend less on the military (and I spent 13 years in) let's not forget the good work and security our massive defense spending has provided much of Europe throughout the last 100 years. 
We don't spend nearly as much (as a % of our GDP)  than a lot of other countries on military spending. We are big, we do a lot of stuff around the world, that costs money.

Please tell me where I said that it is bad. The first words I actually said we're "I like Bitcoin".

I like Bitcoin... BUT, gold is actually useful and rare. That's what it is backed by. Utility and scarcity.
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:32:33
Gold can do things other elements can't is my point and I think you know that. Bitcoin can only do those things because of its scarcity. Gold is an excellent conductor, it is malleable, ductile, and corrosion resistant.

But it's his responsibility not to lead with the helmet which he did. Should have been called for helmet to helmet.
