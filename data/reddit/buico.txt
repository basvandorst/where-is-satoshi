Right now, almost all of our merchants are from the U.S. Since we use coinbase to handle bitcoin transactions (and they don't allow you to connect a bank account outside of the U.S.) it can be a hassle for foreign merchants.

Awesome eCommerce site! What pushed you to accept bitcoin and how was the integration with BitPay?

Nice to see more recognition in the bitcoin startup world. Will only help global adoption.

It's interesting to see the interest demographics on Facebook as well. Using the ad creator you can see that there are 440,000 with interest in bitcoin in the US. 
340,000 are male, and 100,000 are female. This doesn't necessarily mean these people have bitcoin, but at least gauges interest.

We do not as of yet. That is definitely something we will look to incorporate as we grow.
Currently we have stores that do very well, but it's about finding a mix of products that cater to the bitcoin community.

From an eCommerce standpoint will you have to report the value of bitcoin at that time for each transaction?

We prefer to not be the merchant of record. There are more tax implications and we want our shoppers to have a direct relationship with our sellers.
