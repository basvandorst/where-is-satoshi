How so? I have been using Paypal for the last 5 or so years and never once had a problem with it. I know that transferring money between two Paypal accounts is free so I really do not understand how it is that bad.

Same here, currently in the process of hopefully being able to get a whole Bitcoin in my wallet someday.
This whole situation is really exciting to watch unfold!

Well as myself as the person who is using my paypal account to give someone else money in exchange for their bitcoins, as long as I'm trustworthy everything should work out, correct?
Also, what is the longest amount of time someone can wait and still chargeback? Just wondering.
Edit: added a question.

You mean like what happened ~5 hours ago?

That would be quite convenient. 
Any ideas for online stuff such as: 
I will buy 3 of f_bastiat's Bitcoins for 100$ each and you, f_bastiat agreed to such an offer, now what happens?

I know this is not directly related to the original post but, how do you make your address available for other people to tip you? Or is it just all private messaging? Thanks in advance!

I expect to not be able to trust the banks or government, but I expect that I should be able to trust a fellow human being....or at the very least fellow redditors who want to see Bitcoin grow and prosper into the amazingness that it very well has the potential to become.

Just tried clicking on the the account number (click here to send funds directly)
And it links you to a dwolla site and it says that account is unavailable. 
Tried this less than a minute ago.

Personally, I would raise red flags if someone's account was less than two months old, but would still consider trading depending on the circumstances.

What's brown and sticky?
A stick.
I'm so sorry...

What do you do when you see a Mexican with a bike?
--Stop him, its probably your bike.
What do you do when you see a black with a bike?
--Stop him, it is probably your black.
I will see myself out now...1129

I suppose, I wish people could just trust others easier and keep to their word.
I was raised that if I agree to something, I better darn well do it.
