Moe is probably gonna have a hooker drown you in pussy juice, motorboat you, and suck your balls the after party to repay you for tonguing his asshole so very vigorously in these threads about the conference.

I think everyone knows penty about drugs, no more education about them is needed.  You would be hard pressed to find someone who doesnt know heroin, meth, or crack is bad for you.
I cant believe this is really your argument.

You must be josh garza then, its clear hes the only one who made a profit over there, lol.

Even if thats the case, the interview shouldn't be withheld from the jurors.  Its the prosecutions job to prove that theory right?

Have you tried the search function? I provided you with the basics but im not gonna spoon feed you the whole story. Search for josh garza, GAW miners, and paycoin.

1. Attendance might be higher if he had higher quality speakers and sponsors.  This isnt a chicken and egg situation, the boycot started because moe accepted money from josh.  To boost attendance, get rid of the scammer, boycott is over.  
2. I agree for the most part, but its important to note that the negative attention moes business relationship with josh garza has brought upon this conference is hurting moes pocketbook.  Give josh his money back, sell more tickets.  Its not like moe even tried to crowd source the money, or say he could get rid of josh if he sold x number of tickets.  All moe has done is damage control, trying to paint himself as some free speech warrior, which is insulting to the members of this community's intelligence.  
3.  We dont know how much moes expenses are, how much he took in, or what the contract with josh is like because moe doesn't reply and post in these threads he starts.  Moe is just talking at us, not with us.  We would know the details if he was being more transparent, and the lack of transparency and unanswered questions from the community leads me to assume the worst.  My house uses less than 150 a month in electric for a whole month, and i can get a whole pizza to feed my family of 5 for less than one of your "pigs in a blanket".  If moe is willing to pay for resources at 10-100 times over the market value of the resources, then i would question his money management abilities.   If there are no good venues to have the conference in miami at a reasonable price, then find a new (and possibly less trendy) city! Why would my name be getting me banned?  I read the rules of reddit and i see nothing about being banned for unsavory usernames.  
4.  Being a friend of moe is an obvious bias you have and i think it prevents you from looking at the situation objectively.  I dont know moe, but his lack of transparency and his business relationship with josh garza that he wont end (or tell us the details of) leads me to assume the worst.  
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:57:49
Thanks for letting me know the police showed up. Ive been contacting them like crazy saying all kinds of insane shit, but its hard to see what kind of response im getting without eyes and ears on the ground in miami. It warms my heart to see garza had to pay for body guards and im so pleased to hear they actually sent over a group of officers. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:44:59
The money will come from moes bank account, a personal or business loan, crowd funding, ticket sales, or a combination of them.  
We wouldn't have to guess and doubt if he could make the cash in tome if moe had even tried.  Better to have tried and failed than have done nothing at all. (changing it to a Q&amp;A counts as nothing at all in my book)
There are ways to cut costs, it may not be comfortable or ideal but there are ways to do it.  
Josh Garza wont do an AMA for the same reasons moe wont do one.  If i was in moes situation, and really a victim like he claims he is, i would let it be know that i oppose garza and im doing all i can do rid myself of him or at the least distance myself from him.  Moe ignored every hard question, from people who are definitely not trolling him.   Ive seen you vouching for moe, but the rest of us dont know him, and what we know of him looks pretty bad.  What does he have to lose from replying to some of the questions people have asked of him?
Moes reply (or lack of reply) to the criticism has been horrible as well, this isnt about free speech at all.  There is no one who needs a debate to see if paycoin is a scam or not, and suggesting as much doesnt win him any brownie points within the bitcoin community he professes to care so much about‭.

Im always surprised at the number of people in this sub who worship the state.  
Herp derp, thank god the government is here to protect us from people doing drugs in their own home!  Herp derp, how dare he not contribute his taxes, the untied state needs their revenue, how else are they suppose to continue interjecting themselves into every single fucking issue all around the world.

Moe is probably gonna jerk you off, drink your cum, and rim your asshole at the after party to repay you for tonguing his asshole so very vigorously in these threads about the conference.

Im not sure i understand. First of all im not blaming his family for anything, rather i have been making threats against them. I hope josh had to pay more bodyguards to protect his family last night.
How will his family also be a victm, has he extorted them for money too or are they enjoying a higher quality of life becuase of joshes scam? Will his family be going to jail with him? Im on that Christopher Dorner shit, hit em where it hurts most.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:47:38
Its not about moe seeing it, its about reposting it every time a mod takes it down.  I will not be silenced, even if other people find me offensive.  I am sorry to hear that moe will not be joining you and your husband for sex, you seemed kind of excited.
Dont get me started on change tip, why centralize and trust a third party when you dont have to?  Why not just use the bitcoin network to send directly to an address?

All of the stipulations that you put on the venue are self imposed.  No one is forcing him to have it at a certain arena, or a certain weekend, or even in miami.  
But moe knows now, and he has decided to make the people who attend his conference his own victims.  In b4 you say "oh the contract" cause i know its coming.  Thats all speculation, moe hasnt said a word about his contract with josh.

I dont doubt that there is a contract, the details of the contract is what im interested in.  As i said in another reply, moe isnt talking with us, just talking PR at us.  He could come reply to the thread he started and let us know the details so we dont have to assume and speculate.
And by the way, place time and location do matter.

Just stop what?  The case and evidence is weak, i doubt they will be able to get a conviction.

My first time using the merchant app was the other day when i was trying to buy a sandwich.  There was a tab on the top that prompted me for my email, and there was a tab next to it with the plain text bitcoin address.  There was no QR code by the plain text bitcoin address.  The shop owner said if i enter my email they would email me a QR code but i didnt give up my info so i dont know if thats true or not.
The bitpay merchant app seems much easier to use.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:16:56
I did end up doing exactly that.  I had to type in exactly how much bitcoin to send to the merchant though, and i wasnt sure if the exchange rate on my app was the same as the exchange rate the merchant was using.  I didnt want to short the vendor.
I also was worried that the vendor was trying to instantly convert to cash.  I didnt want him to end up holding bitcoin that he didnt know he had, bitcoin that he though he had converted to cash to cover his costs.  I saw a post about a florist who had some issue and was complaing about being shorted on an order when in realiy they still had bitcoin in their wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:04:09
Lol @ fud.  Im reporting my experience using a coinbase merchant and other people in this thread have reported similar experiences, must be FUD.  Instead of trying to improve our service, lets attack the credibility of people reporting problems.
by the way, it was on an ipad so you dont offer a merchant app to this vendor.  Im gonna go back monday and get him signed up for bitpay.
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:42:29
Thats how i eventually paid the guy, but it left it up to me to send him the right amount to his wallet.  I wasnt sure if my mycelium app had the same exchange rate as coinbase was using at that time and i didnt want to short the vendor.  
I think this vendor used the "request payment" button.  It wanted an email, and there was was a tab next to it with a plain text bitcoin address with no QR code.  It would be awesome if it could just pop up a QR code with the amount of bitcoin requested in the QR code like a typical bitpay transaction.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:11:07


How would a user moving their bitcoins between personal wallets be "scamming us"?  That sounds like someone using bitcoin to me.....
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:00:07
According to coinbase, their code is closed soruce so you have to take their word for it.  
On an open source wallet you have all the same features, and you dont have to trust a third party.
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:18:47
I know thats not why you built it, by why not add the option for in person payments?  People are clearly using the wallet for in person sales.  Adding that option would have made my transction much easier.  
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:07:19
Right on, especially about the merchants.  When i told a merchant i didn't want to enter my email last week, it flustered the poor guy.  He ended up passing his ipad over the counter to me so i could dig deeper for his bitcoin address and pay him for his food directly from my mycelium app on my phone.  Coinbases data mining is hurting bitcoin adoption by making it way more complicated than it has to be.
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:27:17
I refused to enter my email so i dont know what the process is after that.  I would have paid with cash before i gave coinbase any identifying information.  
The sandwich was $6.  This isnt about "know your customer" laws or any fincen regulations, its just coinbase data mining.
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:53:38

Why would coinbase not put a QR code in peoples "personal accounts"?  It seems like an easy change that would help out vendors using an ipad.  Like i said in another post there are a few people reporting this issue in this thread so im not the only one encountering this issue in the wild.  
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:37:04
Well yeah, that would be pretty clear cut theft. I doubt that any criminal with the savvy to pull off a crime like that is going to cash out via coinbase without any tumbling. And if it was really that easy the first guy wouldn't sell the bank account info for $5, they are pretty good at spotting fraud.
If he had said, "we track bitcoins that have been stolen from us" then i wouldn't have spoke up. What he said made it sound like they track everyones transactions for "linked accounts", looking at who is transacting with who.  Following stolen coins is completely different from data mining your customers transactions. I was just trying to get a clarification on the sentence in parenthesis up there.  
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:52:15
Great find, thanks for the info
Coinbase should put the QR code in with the request bitcoin function to make it easier to use.
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:19:35
Yes, i am 100% serious.  I had to either enter my email (aka give coinbase my identity) or enter the bitcoin payment address manually one letter at a time.  There was no QR code at all for me to scan and sent payment to.  Why on earth doesn't coinbase pop up a QR code like bitpay does?

@_date: 2015-02-21 18:42:24
I went to a coinbase merchant last week to buy a sandwich.  When it came time to pay, the merchant was prompted by the coinbase software to have me enter my email. Why would you ask for my email, this is crap.  You dont need my email, you  should have just  popped up a QR code.  I dont want to enter my email to buy a sandwich when i can just scan the dude's ipad, Cut out the data mining already!
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:09:45
When im prompted for my personal info, i assume the worst.  Its not provably false, we just have to take your word (and coinbases) word for it.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:07:45
The vendor passed his ipad to me.  Both of us were unable to find the QR code to submit payment to.  We spent about 5-10 minutes standing there looking for a way to pay without an email.  There is no reason the QR code isnt the first thing that comes up when accepting payment, it should be the default setting.
