Should I be worried about Bitcoin Unlimited? 
How likely is it that they will do a hard fork without enough consensus and essentially split bitcoin?

How about you tell Roger Ver to stop spamming the mempool

Hmm, good point

Only the idiots (like you) think this way. There are steps for bitcoin to evolve into a proper currency. First it needs to become a store of value, a proper trusted store of value. That's what's been happening over the last few years. People are becoming conditioned to hoard this asset, people need to actually *want* to receive this asset and hold this asset in order for it to become a currency. No more playing hot potato of "I gotta sell this ASAP before it loses 50% of its value!" like 2013 days... now people want to hoard it because they see its value and the future growth potential. Now they will be more likely to accept it as a means of trade compared to 2013 and before. The more the network grows by these hoarders, the more useful it become and less volitile it becomes making it a better currency. There are steps, and it's heading the right way. 
Get your short sighted bullshit out of here

I don't know, it's probably here to stay as well but it's more risky than bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:56:22
Here's the thing.... people will tell you to max out your 401K and IRA, as if there's zero risk involved in betting on the market. What if I told you that you're taking a bigger risk NOT having some skin in the game of crypto. The best/safest way to have some skin in the game is with Bitcoin, It's not going anywhere. I would even argue that it's not as risky as some people make it out to be.

THIS!! 
I hate it when people like u/DoiF come out and say shit like "*oh you had NO idea where bitcoin was heading!*" 
No actually some people did have an idea, and they did realize there was a huge risk involved. But the risk to reward ratio was too good to pass up, that's what most people don't see. Stop acting like this was exactly like going to Vegas and betting on red in roulette

1. What are miners running to mine bitcoin.... is it a program? Like a software you install on windows and just run? Or is it something else. 
2. Who is hosting the code for bitcoin? I don't really understand how "open source" code works. As in, the code is hosted by someone or some platform that is centralized right? Who gets to decide what gets accepted in the latest code? I guess I just need a general understanding of how this process works and how it's decentralized
3. Fees --&gt; Miners don't decide on the fees right, is it all based on the user? How are fees determined?

This is why most people are confused as fuck on what's going on with bitcoin ;)

TL;DR of fix?
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:58:09
So segwit will make mining more decentralized?

We need this in the USA

Doesn't seem like many are talking about it there. One thread with typical clowns doing damage control for Bitmain

This... what the fuck happened to this guy?
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:02:57
Oh, so you haven't even passed kindergarten level english? 
got it, don't need advice from you then

Yeah I'm talking about 60 BTC. I won't get a Trezor/nano in time before the July 21-Aug 1 drama that might result in a split chain. 
And yeah...I just installed a fresh copy of Windows 10 in this laptop. 
But even if I install the electrum wallet in this new laptop, I still need to connect to the internet to connect the electrum to a server in order to generate my wallet address right? 
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:52:24
Ok, I will 'loose' 60 coins
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:38:19


Oh what?? 
Is it still safe to keep my BTC in an electrum wallet without going though tailsOS? I tried installing tails once and it just didn't work.. I got stuck during the complicated installation. 
I have a laptop that has never connected to the internet.. is it safe enough to install the electrum wallet there and send the BTC to that wallet?
