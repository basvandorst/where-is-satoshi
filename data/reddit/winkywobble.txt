You a condescending bunch. Ever heard of first mover advantage? Copyright? Ownership rights? Trademarks? If those projects moved over to bitcoin they'd have to carry their existing investors over, and they'd be issued their own tokens on the lightning network. Coins with use will not simply go to zero because they switch to another network ��
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:18:45
Market prediction can be used in any market in the world. You think trading of commodities for example will just cease to exist?  And yes, any smart contract written by anyone whether on lightning or any other platform, will have a demand for security audits. You two clearly don't have a clue about this crypto stuff beyond... duh bitcoin is duh best.

If bitcoin is mass adopted it means a large supply of fiat will be dumped for bitcoin, reducing its value, causing a cascade of people buying bitcoin. Stores will stop accepting fiat and will accept bitcoin instead. That means in order to live you will have to spend your bitcoin. It also means the price will level off, reducing its usefulness as an investment and increasing its usefulness as a means of exchange. People won't hold bitcoin in the future, they will spend it. The same way people hold/spend fiat today.

You have the completely wrong attitude. Try telling that to investors in 2014. Looking at the value of your cryptocurrency in terms of fiat is just a sign you're another speculator. The only investors I know of that still look at their bitcoin in terms of fiat value are post 2017 amateurs.

If you believe in the tech, your quantity of coins has not decreased. You still own a percentage of the supply, you've lost nothing. Price is irrelevant.

US debt is increasing faster than actual US gdp. It is mathematically impossible for it not to crash sooner or later. I never picked a winning crypto, I'm saying at the current time we are still to reliant on fiat. You can own 10 000 btc or ANY crypto, but when a crash happens you won't be able to convert to fiat, because of credit freezes and other problems that occur during these.kinds of crises.

Bitcoin will still work, its decentralized and therefore robust. As op said, it'll be useless because you won't be able to convert to fiat. My argument the entire time is the inability to convert to fiat.
Accepting reality as it is doesn't make you a nihilist.

Thats true. However some people value their time with family/friends etc more than the opportunity cost that may require time trading/researching etc. My point is the original op is obsessed with the price, and fails to take into account value, time, or long term price. Many people are down in fiat value at the moment, and don't really need the 100th jackass telling them they losers. Some people are perfectly happy with x10 returns every 2 years or the direction crypto is going.

Not just greed, the market crashed double digits twice in the months leading to the parabolic move. New investors would have had no clue what was coming.

Comments like yours come around every cycle. Nothings changed. You'll probably be screaming tulip bubble within a year.

Lol getting a lecture from a guy who doesn't understand basic biology, you also compensating on the climate change comment because I've said nothing about it other than its not anthropogenic. I don't care what low iq clowns who believe the above stupidity think of me

Thats true, I'm talking about in maybe 5 years from now when a 10% increase in price takes 100s of billions dollars, as opposed to being able to easily double it with that kind of money.

Huh? I'm not a JP fan, and I didn't say a thing about free speech �� That said, there's nothing "academic" about being a tranny, and the idea that I have to shut my mouth about these mutants IS a violation of free speech. Also I believe in climate change, but I outright reject the idea of it being anthropogenic. And no, this isn't a discussion of my personal likes/dislikes/beliefs, but a response to some of those things you called criticisms of the guy.
