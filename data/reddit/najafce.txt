Only if one can identify peaks and valleys.

Seriously, I have been waiting and waiting to buy more at 10k but its not dropping. I guess that's one way of staying optimistic.

I think the part where supply of bitcoin vs that of Fiat tied "crypto" is different will come in to play later down the road. Like I said, its good for awareness and the trust people will develop in the so called "Facebook crypto currency".   
From Facebook's point of view, its only an "in-house" coin that will be used for payments and the biggest advantage to them from having their own coin is to track who is spending where... more fucking DATA!

I have limited knowledge about crypto and facebook's coin but here are my my two satoshis..
\- Facebook's "crypto" is tied down to fiat currency and sounds like its far from what actually crypto currencies are.
\- It will help in raising awareness about crypto currencies overall even if Facebook's coin is not 100% what cryptos should be

This comment about SO supporting crypto is one the most important one because no one talks about the feelings of their SO being supportive or otherwise while investing their hard earned money into something that is not really clear to everyone yet. 
DCA, no doubt.

Its actually great to see people with a lot of money and good stuff. If they have it, they deserve it to the fullest. Happy for them. And, we will get there too &lt;3
