This may be a dumb question, but even if they had bitcoin, would they be able to use it? Its not as readily usable as regular currency. I guess all they would really need is a phone? I dunno doesn't seem like theres many smart phones in this area

Ohh I see, so the person would go to that bogus website and it would say they had to deposit a little bit to meet the minimum withdraw amount. This image makes it sound like its a geographical issue. Thanks

This might be the dumbest thing I've ever seen
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:49:13
Dumbest post I've ever seen. "Bitcoins been around for years but I just took the year with the most growth, there you go"
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:30:36
Appreciate your time man, I really do. So like how do I even begin to get on your level. I don't know what vaporware even means. But I appreciate you telling me that bitcoin is the way to go. I might drop a couple grand on it. Any literature or videos to help gain some intellect on this subject is greatly appreciate. How did you start?
