How much of Bitgo's resources have gone into this? How much of a haircut are they taking? I only used your exchange because it was meant to be the most secure. Now it gets breached and they aren't taking responsibility or taking a loss but all those unaffected on your exchange take the loss...

Facebook is launching their own cryptocurrency. The name Global Coin has been thrown around but it looks like Libra will be the name of the token on the Libra blockchain.

It's basically a 'put your money where your mouth is' price discovery mechanism, for both the post fork price and the chances of the fork happening. If you think the likelihood of segwit2x is greater than say 10%, but the BT2 token is trading at 5% BTC value, you would be happy to buy that token, thus creating price discovery just like we saw with Bitcoin Cash trading on viaBTC before it launched.
