We should just take $ for it. Makes it easier to convert ;-)

Just create a revocable living trust. I don't think it's worth to do more and you can just add everything you own to it. You're still in control and it's good to have anyway for inheritance purposes (e.g. the basis for captial gains resets in certain cases).

Especially if you see that the Swiss banks not only lend out your money but they also give you minimal interest if at all and charge you monthly fees to have an account with them (besides PostFinance).

There is a difference between high six figures and six figures are high. But I don't care. My point is that there is free education and that I support it. I want everyone to have the chances I had and  have more people that think and not just attack others without any argument.

It would be OK if the US would require you to pay taxes only if you live in the US like every normal country does. IMO it's fair to pay the taxes where you live and not where you're born.

I would call my education in Germany free. My parents payed nothing for Kindergarten, nothing for elementary and high school (and also there where no expected donations or extra property taxes like in Palo Alto which makes the school system very unbalanced and gives kids of high earners a better chance in the future). I payed nothing for university and even got a free loan to use at my discretion but didn't need it so gave it to my parents (everyone can get this in Germany if their parents don't earn enough). My parents never went to high school and still I had the chance to go to university because everything is free and you don't have to think about it. The only thing I payed during university was ~150 Euro every half year which included full public transportation for the whole 6 month. So the only real costs you have in Germany (and Switzerland) are living costs that happen no matter what. But education itself is free and they also help you in lots of ways to earn a little bit extra to pay for whatever else you need. Now I earn the same high six figures my privileged colleagues from Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley, etc earn but I could invest my money instead of paying back 100k+ student loans. I'm free to work whereever I want (e.g. in my case Singapore, Sydney, Zurich, and San Francisco) because I had free education.

Agreed. It's also amazing how little goes into education here and how disfunctional infrastructure planing is in the US.

Income tax in Switzerland (at least Zurich, Zug, Schwyz) is a fraction of what you pay in the US and you get free education, good affordable heathcare, perfect transportation. Not sure where you get your 50% from. Besides that you also earn more in Switzerland while paying less taxes than in the US. It is expensive to live there but everyone can afford to because you'll get a good enough salary in contrast to the US.

It would just be nice if the metaphor would be something more worthwhile. If you really love cars they're great things to own but for most people it just shows lack of imagination and a poor life goal like wanting to be the next top model or teen idol. If you really have FU money you should figure out how you really want to live and not care about what other people think about you (which really is what most people do when they think about a Ferrari, Lambo, etc).
