Its 16.50 and falling. It has been falling non stop since this morning. Smart people are getting out now.
@_date: 2011-06-12 13:03:52
And what is stopping this from happening again? Now that the price has rebounded some everyone should get out now. People are going to be left holding the bags when this hits sub $1.
@_date: 2011-07-02 05:10:03
Just don't IMO. This will probably not be popular but unless you already have trading experience but the pros are going to take your money. This market is even more dangerous than say stocks because of the level of market manipulation is through the roof. I don't think most 'traditional' advice on trading or daytrading works with Bitcoin because of the extreme level of market manipulation.
Please don't waste your money.

Downvoting for asking a question is awesome. Seriously WTF.
@_date: 2011-06-21 06:01:45
God I wish I could upvote you over and over again.
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:36:27
Yet we can't see what people are willing to pay for it because of the dark pools. That is entirely my point.
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:58:32
Thats not the point. Of course its voluntary. The problem is when people sell a large amount of stock it should be reflected in the price. With Dark Pools it is not reflected because the trade is hidden from everyone. This makes the actual price of the stock completely different than what it would be if all the trades were in the clear like every single market ever.
@_date: 2011-06-13 05:47:39
I'll concede to you on that. I
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:26:38
Sell them all. $80+ bucks ain't bad. Or just try and buy/sell on the exchanges for fun.
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:53:00
Its open source so yes someone tomorrow could make 'ByteCoin' or whatever else. You just have to get people to start using it, and for merchants to use it.
There's only going to be a limited number of bitcoins ever mined, so soon we are going to be hitting the point where its incredibly difficult to mine for the few coins left and generally people won't be mining anymore. Mining is just how the currency is 'seeded' into the market.

Yea I meant how much initially put in in USD. Not the current value.
@_date: 2011-06-13 07:02:19
TIL. Thanks for not downvoting. Apparently there is a lot I didn't know.
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:18:06
After seeing this how can anyone trust these clowns? Holy shit that was BAD.
@_date: 2011-06-13 22:06:08
It could be $1 in a few days. I think that's pretty bad advice for something so volatile.
@_date: 2011-06-13 05:00:38


How? Seriously you make no sense. The entire point of the dark pools is so the average joe schmoe can't see what is going on behind the curtains. This goes against every open market principal there is.
@_date: 2011-06-13 06:48:28
You are seriously delusional if you think this is how it works in a real market. There is nothing close to being a 'dark pool' in a real regulated market, which is a good thing.
The difference between buying and selling in the dark pool and regular market is that one affects the price and the other doesn't. If you don't understand this you are completely ridiculous.
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:28:54
Stop calling it an investment. You are straight up gambling. 
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:38:22
The fact that any large trades can cause a panic shows me this currency is nothing but a sham so they have to hide the large trades.
@_date: 2011-06-12 16:09:44
One large sell off by one player almost killed the market. How is that not a huge red flag to you guys? Seriously get out now while the price has rebounded.
@_date: 2011-06-13 20:44:39
This is crashing.
@_date: 2011-06-15 01:34:02
Yea thats right. I forgot thats how the transactions work.
@_date: 2011-06-15 01:33:18
It doesn't but its being treated more like a commodity than a currency at this point.
@_date: 2011-06-13 05:49:21
I guess I keep forgetting there are other markets than Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:37:23
Those are physical assets. You can't trade gold and USD over the market without everyone being able to see.
@_date: 2011-06-13 09:13:17
I've used Slush.
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:34:00
They are just going to get harder and harder to mine. They would just be losing money due to electricity when they are good at making money by selling products.
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:29:52
Its no use in getting through to these people. They will understand when it crashes to near zero.
@_date: 2011-06-20 01:26:43
Maybe. From the looks of things I don't see the price ever going back to what it was before. Maybe it will stabilize at the pre-hype prices of a few dollars because of the true believers, but this is going to drive a lot of people out of bitcoins altogether.
@_date: 2011-06-12 16:16:27
1) There is no real utility. You can't really spend bitcoins on anything.
2) 95% of the people mining/trading bitcoins are pure speculators.
3) Volatility. This is the most volatile market for anything I have ever seen in my life. Bitcoins are going through the boom and bust cycles over periods of HOURS when a regular investment vehicle will take months. You are seeing fluctuations of up to 40% over a few hours. Its just absolutely insane.
4) One player, selling a large amount of bitcoins almost crashed the entire market. The bottom could fall out from this at practically any time. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 12:59:35
Not really no. There is practically zero utility as of right now and its almost pure speculation. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:10:00
Some of these people will believe anything other than the fact that they put a lot of money into a website with basically no security to buy an unstable 'currency'.
@_date: 2011-06-14 17:11:39
Paper loss. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 01:23:36
Sorry but this has destroyed pretty much all confidence in Bitcoins as a whole. It was the failing of one exchange but it was by far the biggest exchange and will affect the others. Once it comes back up there will be more panic selling as people try and get their BTC and cash out of MtGox. This will drive the price down to worthlessness and will most likely never recover. 
@_date: 2011-06-13 09:16:31
The thing that it will for sure do is to stop legitimate businesses from ever accepting it for their products.
Sell your bitcoins before they are worth nothing.
