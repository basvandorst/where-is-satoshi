Technically you have to move your balances between coinbase and gdax, but those transfers are instant and free

There's lots of places to *spend* Bitcoin, but Circle seems like the easiest way to *buy* bitcoin

I would have left this line out, no need to advertise that your company is a small startup
other than that, great ad

I'm not trying to get rich off Bitcoin, I just like to use it. The convenience is worth a small fee
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:35:53
Can someone explain this?

If you don't want to take the time to link your bank account, fill out forms *and* wait for verification, you can turn your cash into Bitcoins in seconds, for a small fee.
And with the volatility of Bitcoin, a bad price today could be a great price tomorrow

Simplicity. It's much easier to make a centralized system than a decentralized system. 
The decentralized nature of bitcoin is incredibly complex, that's why it's such a breakthrough

I think it was actually "Can I *light* my e-cig with my Bitcoins, please?"

Cash can't be used for electronic payments, so you have to use credit cards. Credit card fees drive up prices and make microtransactions impossible
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:48:54
It's still only $0.01.
Consumers don't care if their money goes to transaction fees or not. Magazines can charge $0.09 + $0.01 processing fee

I don't get your point, everyone here still uses credit cards for the convenience, but appreciates that Bitcoin is a better system

Random story:
A couple years ago I was living in NYC and got invited to a random party. Turns out, it was at Nouriel Roubini's penthouse in the LES.
It was the most uncomfortable I've ever been at a party. I was by far the youngest man at the party (mid 20s), all the other guys were older men. And boy were they pretentious, economists and architects and property investors.
The girls, on the other hand, were all attractive 20-somethings. I actually had a nice conversation with a couple young Russian girls, I wonder if my young nerdy self stood out among a bunch of old stuffy men.
I'm sure this type of old-rich-men + young-attractive-girls party isn't uncommon, especially in NYC, but it was eye opening to experience it first hand.
TLDR: I'm a little weirded out by Roubini

I don't think the PS4 will ever be demonized like these other technologies. It's too consumer friendly.
Bitcoin &amp; encryption sounds scary and unnecessary to your average American. Playstations, on the other hand, well known and popular toys.
