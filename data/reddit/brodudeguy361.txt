Yeah, Coinbase is relatively safe. I meant don't keep them on bitfinex since they might lock all US accounts
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:35:20
Just in case, I'd still make sure whatever coins you do have get put into you own wallet

Most erc20 tokens will be disabled. 
"Pursuant to the recent report of investigation issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Bitfinex is taking the proactive step of barring U.S. customers from trading certain digital tokens that may be deemed securities in the eyes of the SEC.
The restriction will generally apply to ERC20 tokens issued through "ICOs" and will go into effect at noon UTC on Wednesday, August 16, 2017. No trading of these tokens will be allowed for U.S. customers. At the time of this post, the tokens active on Bitfinex that will be subject to this restriction are EOS (EOS) and Santiment (SAN)."

Thanks for your thorough reply. Personally, I don't know enough about Ethereum, let alone cryptocurrency as a whole, to offer a rebuttal. I'm still trying to gather as much info as I can. Your comparisons to the Nasdaq's dotcom bubble was definitely a helpful reminder to stay grounded and to do my best to avoid any emotions regarding getting rich quick. Also, thanks for the book recommendation. Looking forward to checking it out
The difficulty bomb is odd and concerning. So are you saying, they can simply abandon Ethereum as a whole if they really felt like it? Is the bomb open source so others can pick up where the devs leave off (if they abandon the project)?

Any specific wallets to use or is it ok to leave in coinbase?
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:26:19
Will check out Mycelium. Thanks for the info!

 What's your opinion on Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:47:37
No guarantees but depending on which funds are chosen, the risk is relatively low.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:05:05
What's the interest rate?
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:48:52
Congrats on making it out of addiction and homelessness. What kind of job did you land btw?
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:46:14
Ethereum and Litecoin are relatively successful 
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:56:52
Nice! Good to hear. Good luck on your future Bitcoin investment. I'd also look into Ethereum while you're at it
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:59:32
Why the hate?
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:33:44
He'd be better off diversifying into certain mutual funds and live off that interest

Any drawbacks to mining with them (Giga-Watt)? I can buy 1 Panda Miner B3 Plus (to mine Ethereum)  with them for $2030, and their calculator states I can make about $5,700 a year in profit.

Why can't you use Coinbase anymore? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:01:02
That quoted explanation is still over most layman's heads lol
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:28:33
In what way?
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:28:19
Why wouldn't anyone just use Purse.io instead?
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:28:46
Let us know how it goes

He wants to sell! Don't help!
But seriously, I wish I could help.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:39:19
Speaking of folding @ home, has it led to any scienrific advances or anything yet?
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:42:46
Can you elaborate? Sure corrections may happen, but ALL the way to ~$0 seems a bit unlikely.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:48:27
Although, this has some aspects of fear-mongering, it's good to at least highlight these possibilities
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:43:42
Good point. Although, they are convenient.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:46:14
Well, was it a good upper? lol
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:50:25
Oh, now I get it. Didn't know they needed a photo of the person also now
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:59:23
That would be about 10% cheaper
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:42:54
How do they know what you actually look like? Have you tried resubmitting the license with a higher resolution such as a scanner? It's odd that they won't accept a valid license
Edit: just re-read you post and saw that your account is locked. So my advice wouldnt apply. Sorry about the mixup
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:29:23
It's a way to raise funds.
