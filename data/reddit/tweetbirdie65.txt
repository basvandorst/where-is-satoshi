IDK, but can only assume he lives w/ his mother and subsists on a diet of consisting of nothing but Funions, Doritos
and Mountain Dew. All though, on occasion he will borrow his mom's car for a 10 mile journey(round trip) to buy $15-20 worth of Taco Bell.

not sure, but I bought BTC last night, about 30 hrs after I made that foolish BTC transfer from CB -&gt; gambling....so if there is a block on buying ethereum right now, then that's prob the issue.  The acct is currently empty of anything so I'd have to buy some BTC or deposit USD in my wallet to see. I guess could try buying $10 of BTC and see if it goes thru.

Actually think it's the credit card and maybe CB didn't flag it.

I was thinking that yesterday after the S2X news dropped. Basically the top 10 posts were just twitter links.

Ver just likes the attention at this point. I think once someone has the money to live an incredibly lavish life they then are just consumed with image. 
His only way to improve his image is taking chances to change the infrastructure of what made him incredibly wealthy. It is a chance to flaunt his genius in the face of "Joe six-pack" or the reasonably intelligent investor who's made a decent amount off BTC or other cryptos. 
With that being his only feat to accomplish, while also having plenty of money to hedge his bets. So, by backing it up the plenty of BTC he still holds to make sure he is still very wealthy, he creates Bitcoin Cash. Like the sports analyst who picks a ig underdog knowing that worst case scenario he looks a little foolish for making the choice, but at the same time if he hits the pick he looks like a genius and is revered by the cryptocurrency community as potentially the smartest of the bunch. 
Small risk/High reward for Ver...that's why he is going through with this unnecessary charade. It is not about anyone, aside from himself. Believe his pitches for Bitcoin Cash as much as the slimey politicians will say anything to reach their desired level of power.

...do you mean CB's ETH wallet is locked, or if not who's?mine? This was actually first time I attempted to buy a little ETH.

Really, now that is even more ignorant of someone to have that much invested in btc but not be on top of the current events that will manipulate it's value. 
I think the OP is saying he is well versed on the "going-ons" of BTC and perhaps other cryptocurrencies. But, if he has 10 good friends he converses with on a weekly basis, that maybe 1 knows a thing about bitcoin and there's a good chance that they none of them have a lick of an idea about it &lt;----(that's just to make a hypothetical example of what he OP is getting at).
I think just not knowing about it is quite common, it's not really to the point yet that I'd expect if I asked 10 random people on a city street what bitcoin, that mroe than 1 could give me even a vague description of it and most would have never even heard of it. But, to invest hundreds of thousands and not know about the (currently cancelled) S2X fork would surprise me much more.

I agree, forget people trying to understand the intricacies of bitcoin when the vast majority of people have little knowledge of the fiat system and combined with having a rudimentary grasp on economical (and basic) mathematics. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:30:22
No I tried to buy a small amount of btc, 10 bucks. They cancelled that on me, too. It could be the credit card, but its the only one I have to use on there, CB won't accept my debit card for some reason (maybe b/c I use a small bank w/ only about 6 or 7 branches). Not going to try a wire deposit because it takes a damn week(5 business days) for the coin to arrive, even though they withdraw money from your banking account within 2 days,

I don't doubt your optimism, but give it at least a month. A spike to 9 or 10K could occur the course of 2 weeks after it dips to below 5K. I actually expect this. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:14:01
It's nice to think it so easy, unless you're a true to life(and I don't believe thye exist) soothsayer. So you are buying now, then it drops another 1 or even 2 K in the next few days and you're thinking. FML I should've been patient and known this bear run was gonna keep going. I invested somemore yesterday, a decent amount in the 7.6 to 8.5 range. And now looking and thinking I am an idiot b/c I could've saced all that I've spent over the past 48 hours, drop it all on the current price and potentially made/saved hundreds. 
But if it jumped back above 10K before I made that move. I'd be kicking myself for missing that chance. The volatility is fickle. I guess you have to just buy when you know it's dropped enough to justify buying and hold on. Of course I boy in the  a bunch in the 8Ks yesterday thinking the bounce back will be very soon, now I feel dumb. In 2 weeks it could be at 14K and it'll seem like the prudent move to have made, OR, in 2 weeks it's at 4 or 5K and I need to show the patience of a monk, believing it'll find it's way back to into 5 figures eventually. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:08:00
Pretty much been doing that. I'm not necessarily done buying so I'lll wait and seee on the what my avg buy price was during the dip. Nothing worse though than than getting it at 7.6K, thinking you aren't going to catch a better deal than that. But, it drops to 7.2 in an hour and you're cursing yourself for logging into that 1 hour earlier, or else you'd have caught the better deal.

Valium would be good for thermal regulation and blood pressure. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:32:52
Yeah I get that. It's like the people who work for an employer that is implementing computer technology and CPU inept employees bitch that they don't get it, but never put in a minutes effort to figure it out. Then they insist someone walk them through it or do it for them...or they just insist "things worked fine before this, why do we need to change?" How about because it's 2018, you moron.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:26:32
I was rhetorically calling people who won't take time to figure the relatively simple process of living in the year 2018 and understanding advances in IT. Like the people I work with who try to push away tech advances and keep out-dated ways of conducting our business as morons. I was not referring to you.

It correlates with the endorphin release if you own bitcoin and google it. All the good news and praise when it was near that 20K mark was probably made it a very satisfying task to google bitcoin if you owned a substantial amount. Also the more it is worth, the more it's worth googling to check up on it and make sure it doesn't plummet 200% in a few months.....and here we are.
I'm joking, of course. And this chart is a joke, obviously. There is not a direct correlation to bitcoin's value and the amount of times people type the word into a google search.
