Despite all the evidence Barr saw of very bad crimes at MtGox, there was a "higher purpose" that made Barr ignore it. Of course it is immoral and he should be prosecuted, maybe with some leniency for speaking out, finally, but that hardly counts now that the damage is already done.
Anyone who doesn't see the continuing prevalence of scammers and crooks in coin markets as a deadly threat to the longterm viability here shares Ashley Barr's willful ignorance and is in peril of repeating the same kind of immoral behavior while thinking it is for a greater good. If you say "forget about it and move on" you are just as wrong as Ashley Barr. I used to laugh at all these "death of bitcoin" articles, but after reading Barr's AMA I think of it as a zombie.
Exuberance over technology is far too easy a vector for pernicious  ideology to get its hooks into us. The cryptography might be unbreakable but when we think tech "solves" something about humanity we're the ones getting dissolved into a doubtful solution. How many people lost, bigtime, because Ashley Barr wanted to see the good in bitcoin? How many silent souls committed suicide after losing their fortune to these hucksters?

I own coins, care, and believe every word in this post to be an honest and authentic representation of how I feel about the mess. However, I'm also consciously saying what no one wants to hear and dressing it up in clothes (predictions) that seduce them into reading. So yeah, Trolling, but not like you say.

In fact I thought that advice was kind of already there in the post above, but hey, read between the lines or don't: the peril is not mine.

If you read that as a psychic prediction, I feel bad for you son.

Yo dawg, ever read Althusser?

Oh, I'd say sooner than later maybe. Not trying to win upvotes with bogus prediction, but if you want my investment advice I'd say grab as many of the cheap coins (or shares) up as you can and dump the old fat ones.

Looking for and making predictions (especially the one linked to currently upvoted to the front page of is exactly the behavior I'm exploiting and criticizing at the same time, in case you missed it.

Crypto-determinism operates on theory which exists in the realm of the mathematical and ignores the aleatory material necessities, i.e., exchanges, markets, governments, investors, and so on.
