You're officially a retard in my book. You have no idea what you're talking about. Most of what you said makes no sense.

Lol this has to be the most retarded post i've seen on reddit in a long time...people have lost bitcoins using every possible method to store coins.

I can send you many links but I'd rather you find them. Search Trezor lost coins or Ledger lost coins on google and reddit. You'll find many. Flaws lies behind the user using "things", whether it is paper, offline wallets, trezor, Users who don't use them well will end up losing their coins.

I've seen more posts of people losing coins using other methods. This guy's account age is 2 hours old, it must be you spreading propaganda. Why do you have to create a new account to do that? Your post got 35 up votes in 24 hours. You clearly see no one agrees with you. This is a real example of FUD! You're clearly trying to advertise something here and you have no idea what you're talking about. Blaming Javascript and such, you clearly have no idea what programming is.

No one reads your website anyway. Ranked 41k on alexa. And I will make sure we get rid of you and replace you with someone else that accepts people's opinion. Bitcoin is not yours. You do not decide anything for it.

I want to fight for Bitcoin's subreddit freedom. We should not allow someone like create such posts and pin them for propaganda. We need to do something about it! why would you even go as far as pinning your opinion. Why didn't you just post this thread and let it die in peace because no one agrees with you. You're trying to push your opinion into people's mind. Not only that, most of what you said makes absolute no sense. Javascript is insecure? Who are you kidding?

This has to be a joke. Can any one please tell this guy to download an antivirus!!!

Why is this even pinned? People have lost bitcoins using every possible known methods on earth (cold storage, hot storage, client wallets, online wallets, ..., everything!). I've been using paper wallets for years and never had any issues. This thread really doesn't make any sense.

Also, I haven't seen a notable bitcoin developer say that. You're hallucinating or something. You're the only one saying that in this thread. With a total of 70 up votes in 2 days, it's official, more people disagree with your opinion. Also, you should not be allowed to post retarded articles such as this one for a decentralized coin. You are forcing your opinion on users while most developers and users disagree with you. You suck.

Another retard that doesn't know how to use a computer.

The guy is already mentally challenged to not realize he's doing something wrong with his paper wallet. He's getting "hacked" for $40. What you described is too hard for such user.
