Tell that to those FIFA dudes. Mt Gox had US customers and exchanged US dollars... the US can absolutely claim jurisdiction. It would still be up to Japan and the treaties in place to go along with it. But depending where their servers were setup, the US could have gotten cooperation with even a different country.

It's not a "real" price drop... if you wanted to buy coins at $180 you couldn't have. Unless you happened to have a $180 buy order on the book before the "flash crash". Bitfinex has leveraged positions, and when the price is going down it hits peoples automatic stop-losses. That means LARGE sums of BTC can all hit the market at once to sell at market price. They said there was very little on the books below $225, so as it chews through the order book (open buy orders at various prices) it means people who had low-ball orders on the book got lucky. It's really a matter of poor liquidity on bitfinex. It's seems there is enough support at &gt;$225

Great contest! I love my Ledger Nano... Ledger doesn't get enough love here. My estimate: **$220.88**

XT adopts BIP 101, which is very different (starts at 8MB and doubles every 2 years).

How exactly does Coinkite make it safer here? If customs takes your ledger, they still can't access your BTC w/o your security card or phone, AND your pin. I believe the ledger wipes itself if you enter the wrong pin 3 times. Simply get a new Ledger, and restore from your recovery key.

Exactly, which is why 8MB in 4 years might be woefully inadequate, and we could be right back where we are in 12 months.

I think pseudonymous small charitable donations is a great app for bitcoin, and this should eliminate one more barrier to entry for charities to accept bitcoin donations.

Can I clone my Nano to the Unplugged (by restoring from the same seed)? This could be useful to keep my Nano w/ my laptop, and the Unplugged in my wallet for use with my phone. I have a OTG USB adapter and that works great, but realistically I don't carry it around with me.

Bitcoin price is still falling and has you feeling down? Don't think of it as thousands of dollars of your hard-earned money. Think of it as a screwdriver for the military.

* Restate my assumptions: One, Mathematics is the language of nature. Two, Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers. Three: If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns emerge. Therefore, there are patterns everywhere in nature. Evidence: The cycling of disease epidemics;the wax and wane of caribou populations; sun spot cycles; the rise and fall of the Nile. So, what about the stock market? The universe of numbers that represents the global economy. Millions of hands at work, billions of minds. A vast network, screaming with life. An organism. A natural organism. My hypothesis: Within the stock market, there is a pattern as well... Right in front of me... hiding behind the numbers. Always has been.

This was news to me, they've been airing this story all day on 88.5 WAMU in DC.

I guess the theory is that it would be pretty ineffective to manually make a mass CASH contribution in $50 increments. Bitcoin makes it trivial to send a massive number $50 transactions. One of the beautiful things about bitcoin :)

You are correct, but bitcoin does meet the definition for tender: "something that may be offered in payment" or "an offer or proposal made for acceptance"... and in the context of campaign contributions it is now an accepted, or legal, tender. But no, not "legal tender". Again, not my wording but it was probably a poor choice for me to repeat it. In this context, though, I don't think it's misleading.

"He has never even been allowed to speak to the public in any way. He has not really been given a fair chance to respond to the claims made about him."
I believe he declined to testify...
All the DPR circle jerking needs to stop. SR is huge thorn in bitcoins side. There aren't enough conspiracy anti-gov idiots like yourselves to make bitcoin a success without broader support. Ross is a convicted felon, and the case was irrefutable. Public support is not on your side. The general public does not want open air drug markets on the internet. If this is the best use case for bitcoin, we are all fucked.

I had a similar story, except I had mined a bunch of litecoins when litecoin first launch. I lost interest after a month. Fast forward 2 years... when I see the story about Silk Road being taken down, I check the price of bitcoin and litecoin and I was shocked. I went through all my old drives looking for wallets. Ends up I had liquidated them on an exchange, but it was less than the minimum withdrawal amount in USD so I just left ~$40 sitting in an exchange instead of letting it ride...
It would be worth about $8000 now.
