What does this mean for apps that are already installed?
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:50:46
That is one of the worst written articles I've ever read
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:20
Best comment I've ever seen
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:23:21
Fake and gay!
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:19:14
Should have put everything into Tether
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:23:42
Be gone with them!

Also, I looked up name of the username (Luka Magnotta) and found that there is a Canadian man with that name who was convicted with the murder of a Chinese man in 2014, a year after this was posted. Weird.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:09:06
This man goes out of his way to be hated
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:06:06
You done goofed
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:20:48
Congrats brotha

This man is brilliant.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:00:14
It's just getting started. Can't expect widespread adoption immediately
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:36:07
Hey it's me, your Uncle Brad, remember me? I'll take care of those for you
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:20:26
Definitely keep your job. Like he said, you never know what will happen with the market. I would just try to use up as much of your free time to learn as you can.

Considering that Version 1.4 claims you'll be awarded 1 BTC per day, I would say don't trust it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:17:36
Any time you see "Internet Money" you know a person has no idea what they're talking about
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:30:13
Ultimate troll

You didn't post a link

They have been dealing with a lot of new traffic recently. They added 100,000 new users in one day for example, but they are working on it. It is still the most trusted and widely used exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:15:53
According to him, all you have to do is read a book a day and you'll get rich! It's that simple!
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:22:44
Completely agree with the technical analysis part. Never understood why people try to apply that to crypto
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:57:30
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:17:27
Lol hate to break it to you but you won't find one

Watch videos by Andreas Antonopoulos, he has a lot of videos catered for beginners. Do as much as your own research on bitcoin and blockchain technology as you can. Read articles, book, watch videos, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:28:18
Tether, Bitconnect, Bitcoin Gold
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:46:19
Should have loaned it all to Bitconnect
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:35:50
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:26
Decide yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:09:12
Watch Bitcoin videos by Andreas Antonopoulos to gain a better understanding of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Do as much of your own research and reading as you can. As for getting started, I would recommend Coinbase, as this is the easiest and most secure way of putting money into bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:50:49
Lol the newcomers really coming out of the woodwork with these questions
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:06:28
This was all very helpful. So from my understanding, if I don't cash out, I don't have any taxes to pay. Because I plan on hodling everything.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:41:22
Let me buy one
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:39
This is madness!
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:01:47
Wtf hahahah
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:48:08
You need a lot of equipment. Excavators, dump trucks, bulldozers. Not cheap, tough to turn a profit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:53:31
Wow this is creepy and almost spot on
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:30:26
Are you this guy 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:20:55
Yeah, ironic since they used to shit on crypto
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:48:02
Ohhhh Jim

That is weird. The other night I had to replace my phone and forgot to disable my 2FA. Once I realized that I was essentially locked out of my account, I submitted a support request and surprisingly they resolved the issue by the next day. I had heard about them taking forever to resolve issues though.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:44:26
I saw one at my local mall the other day
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:03:02
Cannot stress how important this is.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:23:43
This is great
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:50:43
This article is so bad it's actually quite funny
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:03:44
Wow this is great, good work
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:39:02
Why I just bought shares of Overstock.

Another solution: If you have access to a Bitcoin ATM, withdraw cash from your bank, then directly deposit the cash into a Bitcoin ATM. They will never know.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:04:12
That thing is dope
