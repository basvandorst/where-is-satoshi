Definitely agree that moving btc around from wallet to wallet isn't a taxable event.  But, to make sure people don't get the wrong idea - per the IRS notice on virtual currency ( spending btc is also a taxable event (an "exchange" since btc is considered property).  If you have btc with a basis of $10 and spend it on $100 of pizza, then you have a $90 capital gain that needs reported. 
At this stage though, I imagine the IRS is just looking at folks who cashed out big amounts on coinbase, because doing anything more isn't worth the effort.

It's logically consistent with income taxation generally though. It's never mattered if someone pays you in dollars, gold, diamonds, or bananas - the IRS has always considered that income and taxes are due in USD.  Otherwise, you'd see multinational corporations operating on the barter system.

FYI, this is simply the IRS providing clarification. There's a presumption that anything of value not otherwise classified by the IRS is a capital asset. Take a look at the definition of capital asset here: 
Objectively, why would the IRS grant immunity from back capital gains taxes to someone who bought a thing at $100 and sold it at $900?

No you wouldn't. There was no appreciation in that fact pattern and therefore no capital gains. If you bought a bitcoin for $600 and then bought $700 worth of goods with it, then you would owe cap gains tax on $100.

Hopefully in two weeks there will be shorter lines.  The max cash withdrawal will also go up starting tomorrow. Primarily though, just make sure you can pay for all your accommodations with a credit card.  Also, while there is a premium, if you arrange a taxi through your hotel it'll generally be rolled into your bill so you won't have to pay cash for that either.
I actually saw my first Rs 2000 note in person today so it's starting to get out there.  Guy said he only had to wait about 1.5 hours for it.  Funny thing is that no one can make change so if you get one of those, choose where to spend it carefully....

I'm a foreigner who has been living and working in the Delhi area for 3 months.  For anyone who is middle class (and doesn't have black money of course) this is mostly an inconvenience.  Cards still work, lots of stores started using a credit system, some places will still illegally accept the old notes with a slight haircut, and electronic payment options are fairly big here.
It sucks a lot more for tourists and the poor who tend to rely more heavily on cash for their daily activities. Only way for tourists to get legal tender is to line up for 3 hours at an ATM and even then it's capped at the equivalent of about $30.  Taxis, guest houses, tourist attractions, etc. often only take cash so it's pretty big hardship if you're here to do normal tourist stuff.  Foreign credit cards also don't work a lot of places.
Indians without bank accounts are also in for a bad time since they face long lines and low exchange limits for the new notes even after the dust settles.  But for the moment, everyone is lacking cash. Most of my white collar coworkers are just completely out but don't seem too concerned about it because of the alternatives mentioned earlier and they have the luxury of simply avoiding situations that require cash.

Same.  I remember overhearing my aunt brag, in all seriousness, about how beanie babies were going to pay for my cousin's college education.  I was 12 and thought she was an idiot.
Luckily my cousin became a drug addict and had no use for the beanie baby college fund.

In most situations no one would owe federal taxes on a house (or bitcoin) sold for $1. There are only three types of tax that I could see people thinking might apply:
* Capital gains - Selling a house for $1 would not trigger capital gains tax for the seller, since it's less than he originally paid and there is no gain. End of story. 
* Gift tax - The actual fair market value in excess of $1 *would* be considered a taxable gift, however, it just dips into the seller's unified lifetime gift/estate tax exemption (the first $5.4 million is tax free). 
* Income tax - Gifts are never taxable income for the recipient. As an added bonus, they also get to keep the giver's tax basis, rather than having it reset to $1.
So no one is paying any tax at the time of sale. The buyer might eventually have to pay capital gains down the road when he sells the house, if the proceeds are greater than the original seller's tax basis.
All things considered, I think it's a pretty fair and reasonable outcome.

Why do you think greenaddress is a bad idea for a wallet?

A couple years ago, I recall "low fee" being a much touted advantage of bitcoin.  I always thought that was odd considering I pay zero fees for other common payment methods, but now it's just ridiculous.

There are benefits compared to a local software wallet.  The trade-off is that if they disappear, you can't access your coins for X days, where X is defined by your nLockTime settings.
