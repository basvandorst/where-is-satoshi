I call shenanigans, what kind of European would think banking works the same all over Europe?

That's the point, anyone could then have a wallet with a big button that said "attempt to reclaim" spending a small transaction fee in the hope of getting the money back. Sure it wouldn't work every time but most of the times it would work.

Because nobody would be willing to wait for transaction confirmations at a vending machine and anonymous petty theft would be trivial to perform and too expensive to pursue.

Because Mark Karpelles is a fictional character from a tv-show that wants to give clues to the audience?

Sadly enough, both are impossible.

Well, given a block reward size, a marketvalue, an expected lifetime relevance^* for any equipment, the total power of the network and the number of block rewards per unit time then you need to buy equipment for less than:
    marketvalue*reward size*relevance*reward frequency/total power
To break even.
Which with my best estimates is approximately 600 USD/GHps (600 US dollar per gigahash per second).
*Relevance is a linearization of equipment lifetime and its share of the network power, formally an approximation of the integral of 1/f(t) from t = now to now+expected lifetime of the equipment where f(t) is the total network power.
EDIT: Corrected a minor error with my figures

Anyone who actually believes in these figure and isn't taking out a second mortgage to buy up as many bitcoins as possible is either lying or dumb.

Since people were looking to frame him it wouldn't have mattered for them if it got past USPS or not. Therefore it getting past USPS this time is no indication that USPS is secure in this respect.

This is the most stupid graph I've ever seen. Given arbitrary cutoff points and scales you can fit ANY stochastic process with any other stochastic process with probability going towards 1.
Hell if the stochastic processes aren't discrete they can be fitted perfectly with probability 1.

Realistically, no. During the war you would be able to spend on ever fragmented bitcoin chain, and even if it did survive, being unusable until we manage to rebuild after the war would make its value nill.
