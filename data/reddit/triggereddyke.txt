Companies on the stock market have to make money for growth. Bitcoin isn't a company that needs to make a profit, it could be compared to gold but that's not accurate either. Gold has uses and as long as there isn't something that does it's job better for cheaper it'll always have value, but Bitcoin can always adapt to do it's job better than anything else since it's just code. There really is no downside to Bitcoin in terms of remaining relevant or having a use.
What other product is completely adaptable? Bitcoin is a whole other beast, how is risk modelling it anything other than guessing at this point?

Department of Treasury has it, it's an unclaimed fund.  is a good resource to print off forms to bring in and collect your funds. Note that the state's database of names and properties is shit, so many names and addresses are misspelled when they did their data entry to create the database. A state worker will not search for alternate spellings or misspellings, as a licensed finder I did search for that stuff. I'm no longer licensed and can't help with that part but you can use the above site to search for misspellings and use the "*" after the first few letters of your last name to get a batch of names similar.
I used to give people back their money that the state was collecting free interest on for a living.

Don't they legally have to tell customer's if their data is mishandled as soon as they find out?
