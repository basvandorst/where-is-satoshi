I do not trade chart patterns, this is simply not my style. This is a personal choice and I could be wrong. To me patterns are too subjective. I only use the indicators I developed with my team.
I only express my opinion and I can be wrong when I say that Bitcoin looks bearish :)

Hi mate!
Thank you for your concerns but our short is doing very well and is still in good profit. We always welcome constructive criticism and feedbacks, we believe this is the best way to learn. However criticism without arguments is simply a loss of time for both of us.
We would love to have a constructive debate with you. Unfortunately, we are still waiting for your arguments for being bullish (TA, fundamentals etc).
We are still bearish and stick to what we said. You will find updated versions of our chart here [
Trade safe.

Bitcoin starts looking slightly bearish to me. Waiting for CME to open, it usually set the tone for the coming week.
Do not forget that Bakkt will be launched in exactly a week. Despite reading interesting posts on Reddit I am still split. There are very good reasons to be bearish as well as bullish.
Trade sage guys!

I am waiting for the CME to open before taking any position, but I am preparing myself to short. Once again, this is only my opinion and I can be wrong :)
Trade safe guys!
