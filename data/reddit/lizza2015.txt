I didn't import that private key.

I didn't input my encrypt key yesterday. Shouldn't be virus.

and that didn't explain why Gavin is involved in that address. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:23:06
yes I know this address is public. But I really copied it from the Bitcoin-QT. see the screenshot.

I'm not new to Bitcoin and I have no reason to lie.

The btc transfered to 16jum8CHKv6g1rLiCzrcP9Qc7k1ww4XXgx . But why 3QJmV3qfvL9SuYo34YihAf3sRCW3qSinyC also sends money to this address? 3QJmV3qfvL9SuYo34YihAf3sRCW3qSinyC should be owned by Gavin. It's written in the code. https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fgavinandresen%2F3966071

I really couldn't remember I imported any private keys.  I'm downloading Sophos.

No. The address was generated in Bitcoin-QT.

Maybe I imported that address while reading that Chinese tutorial. But it should be long time ago and really cannot remember that.
Then the thief monitor that address and stole it. Gavin's testing address was also monitored so small amount of btc also transferred to the thief's address.
I fucked up. Expensive lessons
