Wow, that's amazing, i though uneddit only restores deleted content. Thanks for that.

I've read somewhere that the spelling mistakes are intentional, so as to filter out the people that are not credulous enough to begin with.

Good summary.
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:06:29
If people will work on projects and accept payment in bitcoin, there should be friction only on the donator side, not the whole bid-ask.
There are many places where this phenomenon got rolling. One being but there's also other sites.
There are also sites (mostly local) facilitating peer-to-peer exchange, where there's even less and potentially 0 losses on exchange for potential donators.
Hopefully in some time, one could do business *inside* the Bitcoin network, without going in and out of it, losing on exchange. Think long term, one year ago, all this happening was inconcievable.
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:49:45
It's a good summary, but I think you should add this as well. It's one of the other comments he made but promptly edited:

Determine if it's Bitcoin or litecoin mining rig first.
Litecoin mining uses/used ordinary graphics cards, bitcoin uses fancier equipment. 
Google "bitcoin mining hardware" then "litecoin mining hardware" and get a general idea.

JordanRobocoin1 posted a screenshot of payment of 25k. There was an attempt of line-shadowing some parts but i would imagine one could easily make out what the characters were (top and bottom was still visible). Some information was not even attempted to be covered.
 I have it saved for evidence, if the OP needs it, ~~please pm me~~ *I pmed the OP with this post*. I will not publish it.
@_date: 2014-04-03 10:27:49
The answers he's giving and the way he's denying are next to trademark for lying. Victimizing is also a huge piece of the puzzle.
I was wary about this business ever since i noticed the flashy ceremonies, conferences, graphics  and media exposure while it had next to 0 achievements. Pump and dump.

If you end up homeless, you might consider you have a gambling addiction. If you risk more than you can lose, or worse than that, borrow money to risk them , you have a gambling addiction and the price of the Bitcoin should be the last of your concerns.

3-5% is still quite a lot.
I would've imagined they'd coinsider 1 year discounts or something.
Especially since these are not cash atms that have many mechanic componets that could potentially leak more energy.

By the way, here's proof of his latest admittal of responsibility:
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:52:59
He did. I messaged the mods about it and they said they can't do anything about it. The most I can ask them I think is to point out the exact time of submission (not x hours ago). I don't know if they can or will though, but i'll try now.
I happened to notice his initial post quite fast, i replied and it was edited in a span of a few minutes after my reply. 
That's all I have, sadly.
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:36:51
I'd partly agree with you if this was a matter of days or weeks. And OP did seem more than generous with his time and expectations. Asking for restocking fee of 5k??
I do agree that the rental space was probably not the best idea.
All in all, it's a good thing all this happened, if not, we wouldn't get to see how shitty Jordan behaves.
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:03:45
Given how he edited something just now because I called him on it, i doubt he was shadowbanned.
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:59:25


Not the right actions, **but the only actions he has left**. And he got there by fucking up 3 times in a row. He got to where he is now because people called him on it, not because his conscience was taunting him.
He did the intelligent thing.
@_date: 2014-10-15 15:49:40


Haha, so you're sorry that you were caught.
Why did you delete your other reply, btw?

Well i'm part of the community too, should i start pushing my own agenda too, since i could be paid in Bitcoin?
There's no scent of shameless pluggery, it mostly shamelsss pluggery, and there's no some posts, it's most.
Not that i have any problem with what she's doing, i wish her well, but this is not the place to do it.
We know already Bitcoin allows for microtransactions and can close the gap between customer and service provider. It's one of it's best incentives in my oppinion. This obviously can apply to adult industry, and this could have been emphasized by OP in a much toned down version.
@_date: 2014-10-15 20:12:28


It's called exposing a fraud and it's healthy. The way the system works today, with companies being able to get away with 0 liability is/should be long overdue.
Could he have managed his risk better sure? Next time he will.
**Would Robocoin not resort to shitty practices in the future had they not been exposed?** No. They had no reason not to. Just have a look on how their CEO [tried to brush it of initially]( and you'll understand.
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:38:39
I'd go meta for this:
Bitcoin is **appreciation** for any other person's work or contribution, that is **relevant to YOU**. Doesn't matter if it's merchandise, service, donation. You benefited, **Bitcoin transfers your thoughts of appreciation seamlessly into action**. Removes friction.
@_date: 2014-07-23 14:39:20
That's the version that i had in mind. Apart from this contest part where it gets more into marketing side, even though someone asked, to my understanding.

I assume getting cash out of the ATM is the mechanically challenging part. And this topic is about one way (ingoing cash) ATMs
Don't know too much really, it's just that i figure a regular withdraw (cash) atm consumes more energy than a deposit one

First of all, i doubt this is even true and they can't and/or are not allowed to do it, it's more judiciary/PR gymnastics to distance themselves from the whole privacy issue.
If it would be possible, that would mean that evidence should be inaccessible without the consent of the entity that is withholding it in the first place. All this happening under warrant, i'm not talking about system failures.

While the question of "how far down that road one goes" is a legitimate concern/ observation, the fact that **one went down that road in the first place** is in no way an indicative for responsibility as you wanted to put it. 
Not to mention he also **deleted** his former posts and edited others to his own benefit.

I'm sorry, but i'll disagree with you.
And this is not related with mass surveillance, at least of what i'm aware on Apple. If I remember properly, Apple was suggesting they could now push encryption that even themselves can't crack and it's only up to the user to allow access (that includes providing evidence to authorities).

Unless you know 100% it will work, no. And what works closest to 100% is a paycheck, or any other low risk investments that return ~5% year, not incredibly volatile assets that swing +/- 3000%.
I don't know much about you but i really feel this train of thoughts of your could get you into trouble. Google gambling addiction and figure this out man.

@_date: 2014-10-18 02:20:25


No it was not. You went one way with an example and the followup was spot on. Abuse hapens in every system. If it was by your logic, we should've thrown away everything that makes a society a long time ago.
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:02:21
I messaged the mods about it.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:04:47
Thanks for your help so far. Still nothing.
I've used Undelete to recover data, i've found a wallet.
Digging further, i've used DeepScan feature to search again and found another entry for wallet, this time in windows.old\...appdata\roaming\bitcoin so it appears the file was originally backed up but then deleted (i'm 100% positive i haven't deleted it).
Now i have two wallets, both same size ~152kb, none work when copy-pasted in Bitcoin folder (by replacing the new, empty wallet). I get ”wallet.dat corrupt, salvage failed”
Another redditor told me to try opening it with a hex editor, and now i'm trying to find a way to work it from there, although this is far from my expertise and i expect i won't be able to do much.
A data recovery would cost me ~140 USD and it would still be a gamble, so considering there was only 0.4xx there, i don't think this approach is feasible. I'm considering looking for a redditor that can try the recovery and split the btc there, if he's interested.

Aren't you supposed to blur their names/faces though?
@_date: 2015-01-12 10:45:57
Doesnt seem like it, but ill keep searching. I was not familiar with backups.
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:35:03
Thank you. ICare does seem to scan more thoroughly, it's estimated at 6 hours as opposed to 5-15 minutes from Undelete. 
I guess i can only wait and see.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:04:05
@_date: 2015-01-12 09:06:54
There is no wallet.dat other than the one created yesterday by installing the client again.
I;m not familiar with backup and i'm rightully paying the price for my ignorance now. I am looking to see if there was a backup set automatically and how i can access one, if any.
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:14:57
found two wallets with undelete, one is from litecoin. Both had status overwritten but it managed to retrieve them.
Once i tried to replace the new wallet with the old recovered one, Bitcoin client fails to start with the error ”wallet.dat corrupt, salvage failed”
Ill start looking for potential fixes for this. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:13:19
Disk is SATA 5400rpm 1Tb. 
The biggest mistake is having defragged it 2 times before realising bitcoin wallet issues.
@_date: 2015-01-12 10:08:44
No, there isn't
@_date: 2015-01-12 09:19:23
I refreshed windows 8. I then reinstalled the bitcoin client, as it was not there anymore.
@_date: 2015-01-12 09:25:11
Good advice, but i've aleady defragged C: 2 times without realising this, being concerned about the HDD.
I will stop using it anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:21:04
It wasn't encrypted, i remeber wanting to encrypt it once but getting scared to modify something. So it's just plain.
@_date: 2015-01-12 09:34:40
Thank you, you are right. Folder was hidden.
appdata\roaming is there but searching for wallet still returns nothing. 
Searching for bitcoin returns a path to \appdata\roaming\microsof\windows\start menu\programs which is empty also.
After refresh, contents of Downloads, Desktop etc folders were not affected, everything was in in place except apps.
@_date: 2015-01-12 13:14:38
I meant that unsave found two walltes, one is from bitcoin, one is from litecoin.  
What ive said was regarding the bitcoin one.
I havent encrypted the file for all i can remember. I had only 0.4 btc there, so i don't think it's worth going to a recovery lab.
After having recovered the files with unsave, can anything else be done (except recovery lab) or i can start using the laptop again? as i have the recovered files saved somewhere else now.
edit: i've also used DeepScan feature in Undelete, it found many wallets, but i imagine some are windows related?  walletframe.cpp or .h , wallet model, wallet stack etc.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:36:15
Most definitely, the mistake is 100% on me.
Also, enable the backup function in OS.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:55:07
Just made a topic, maybe someone will try.
@_date: 2015-01-12 09:24:00
Thank you. I've checked there, \users has Admin, Public and &lt;username&gt;
Admin and &lt;username&gt; have only desktop, documents, each are empty and favorites which has a Links folder, which is empty as well.
Searching for wallet.dat in windows.old returns nothing also.
I will look for GetDataBack, i'm not sure how to connect my laptop drive to something else though. Poor odds though, considering i've defragged it already.
