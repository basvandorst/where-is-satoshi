Well said. Here's a related, short video that I'd recommend everyone watch:
It might look like a cheesy YouTube nonsense video with the tree of life clips, but I assure you it's worth the watch. It really changed the way I look at life.

It can be a metaphor. I grew up poor, and I didn't get to literally "see the world" until I was in my late 20s and could afford to go to Europe, Asia, etc.
But, when I was absolutely piss-poor in high school and college, I still "saw the world" in my own way. I learned new things, I met new people. I read books. Hell, I'd argue that exploring your town, not just by driving through it but by REALLY exploring the communities and people and things going on, can be just as rewarding and mind-expanding as hopping on a plane to Paris. Hell, even moreso in many cases.
I know a lot of people who have never left the states who have "seen more of the world" than other trust fund kids I know who have been everywhere. Physical movement isn't the same thing as travel in my opinion.
I see where you are coming from, and I'm not trying to be overly philosophical. I've just seen both sides of the coin, and the best memories (and most of my intellectual growth) happened when I was excruciatingly poor. I think that when people say "well I can't do xxxxx because I'm poor," it says more about their attitude than their wallet. Sure, you might not be able to take a month of work and fly around Asia, but you can still do amazing things.

This is an ad, for a coffee shop that only accepts bitcoin. It's a lame "viral reverse psychology ad."
That said, it's kinda lame. Let's admit it, guys. There was once a dream of an anonymous banking network, but that dream is dead. Bitcoin no longer serves that purpose. It's just weird e-speculation at this point. It sucks as a means to store or transfer money, and I don't see Mr Joe Schmoe bypassing the banks with bitcoin any time soon.

Well, no. If that was my entire comment, then sure. But it was simply an establishing statement for the rest of my comment.


Because I was very interested in bitcoin back in the day and still own some. I occasionally use bitcoin to play poker and pay for stuff. I like to follow the news. I'm still interested in bitcoin, I just don't think it is poised to "tear down financial institutions" here in 2018. Are you arguing that you can't subscribe to unless you have absolutely nothing critical to say about it?
The only question that is being "begged" here is "why are you so fucking upset?"

I wasn't saying it as a revelation, was just starting my point with the obvious.
Everything else you said wasn't really an argument.

You're a ridiculous person.

Ever heard of a win/win? They get a discount for buying in bulk, and they give a portion of that discount to you.
Just because they are winning doesn't mean you are losing. That is a really stupid way of looking at the world.

I'm dumber for having read this. Thanks, asshole.

Making an over-simplified, oddly-worded conservative talking point on That's a bold move. Let's see how it works out for ya.

Yes, and it's a much lower bill. 
Source: Am American and currently live in the UK. Have such lower Healthcare expenses in the UK that it's mind boggling.

Solid anecdote. Here's mine:
I was working in a country with Universal Healthcare and I got in a motorcycle accident. At every step of the way (ambulance, ER reception, wound cleaning, MRI area, pharmacy, etc), the people were extremely nice, professional, and helpful. Blew my mind, actually. Best medical experience of my life. 
Anyway, let me put this in another way: America is the only modern country in the world without socialized Healthcare. Are you saying that America is the only place in the world with gold Healthcare?

Right, so when everyone has "insurance," it becomes even cheaper. Especially when you don't have to pay out of pocket for poor people with preventable diseases and emergencies
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:09:27
Let's have a sit down, I need to explain to you how insurance works. This might be difficult to hear....
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:23:20
Nah, just dumb people. Educated people who have traveled the world are very aware that socialized Healthcare is superior. Dumb rednecks who have never left Alabama pretend they understand the world and vote against their own self-interest.

I mean, pretty big difference between $4k (when it was $1k last month) and $4k (when it was $10 last month).
That's not how any of this works op
