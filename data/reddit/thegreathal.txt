IANAL, and certainly not a California first amendment lawyer, so correct me if I'm wrong. But I'm under the impression that the national standard is that if Dorian isn't a public figure, he doesn't even have to show actual malice, just negligence from false reporting.
That said, Dorian might be a limited public figure. Okay. You still have a shot at proving actual malice. Fabricating quotes? Ignoring a whole body of previous Nakamoto research? Basing this entirely on speculation? And not even saying that Dorian might be Bitcoin Satoshi, but publishing his personal information on a cover story that decisively dubbed him "Bitcoin's Face" and led to even greater exaggerations from other news orgs? This, after a huge story like this should have been vetted by a team of editors? Would it be so hard to get media experts to testify that this was a cynical ploy from Newsweek's new owners to make up a big story on their debut?
Considering how Newsweek is attempting to reposition itself as an upmarket publication, a lawsuit would (rightfully) reflect poorly on them and they might just settle quickly anyway.

1. "Reputation" in the legal sense is different.
2. Since Dorian worked with classified information, a story implying he's secretly a subversive international man of mystery does adversely affect his ability to make a living.
3.

No kidding. I'm sure legal action seems scary but this article was beyond reckless. It passes the extremely high standard for winning a suit against news organizations in the US. 
edit: blorg is aggressively sowing doubt but I don't think he's correct.
