Punish them for the bullshit they caused and everyone will start playing again.

Is it just me or does the idea to raise money without a plan for said money sound like a way to abuse a position in order to pocket some dough?

If it's repetitive I'd call it spam, but if the bot makes sure to do it only once per user I'd call it advertising.

Nice Meme.

Bitcoin only works when you can buy your coffee with it. If the user base splinters to dogecoin et al, how is a brick-and-mortar merchant supposed to support all that?

I liked the part where he busted out strategic dominance and you countered with value proposition. Now *that* is a conjecture-based conversation! When he asked you what the value was though I think you missed the obvious answer which is... momentum, for lack of a better word? If I'm trying to buy a physical product it doesn't matter what bitcoin's transaction fee is if the merchant doesn't accept litecoin. Hell, Visa charges a flat fee plus a percentage of the transaction!

Okay but seriously, when someone is making conjecture about the future, "prove it" is an inappropriate response. By nature of the topic, proof is impossible; the best anyone can do is point to the past, but even that isn't proof. Unless you're a moron you know this, which means you're making deliberate non-sequitors. Bad form. If you don't want to participate in a conjecture-based conversation you don't have to, but to go into one with empiricism is just derailing.

How so?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:16:32


Why is that a need? This is another assertion without justification.


Bitcoin has a hard cap on the number of bitcoins available; for this reason It's actually *deflationary*. There is no need for a central authority to control inflation because the control is already built into it.


Currency is worth what you can buy with it, capacity of a country has nothing to do with it.


It is, in fact, a real coin. The exchange rates are based on the faith in the currency, just like any other stock. In fact, fiat currency works the exact same way: the value of a dollar and a franc fluctuate based on people's opinions of the situations in those countries, and it is possible to make or lose money by playing these exchange rates.


Not sure what you mean here.
Bitcoin is actually a lot like the gold standard. Bitcoins continue to increase, getting more scarce over time, until eventually there are no more to be mined, exactly like gold.

It's not that they're not received well, it's that your arguments make no sense. I don't mean to be insulting by saying this, but 011010110 asked the right question when he asked whether you understood the technology. Because if you did, you wouldn't be saying some of the things you are.
You are talking about a need for "control" without explaining why. I can only guess that you think people will forge bitcoins somehow? Actually it is easier to forge fiat currency than it is to forge bitcoins. To forge a paper dollar you just need the right materials... paper, ink, etc. I know they've made the currency complicated in order to make this difficult, but it's still possible given enough time and money to create fake dollars. With bitcoin this is impossible. Every coin is tracked in the blockchain from the moment it is mined through every exchange it makes. If I try to give you coin  your wallet checks the block chain and tracks down coin  and says, "wait, you don't actually have coin  User Abc1 has that coin, he got it from Def2 who got it from Fbd6 who got it from Bbq12 who initially mined it! Rejected!"
In response to my question elsewhere you mentioned someone needs to control inflation. Bitcoin already has inflation control built-in. There is a hard limit on the amount of bitcoins that can ever be mined. Once they are all mined, that's it, no more new bitcoins. This makes bitcoin a deflationary currency, not inflationary. Now deflation does have its own set of problems... but inflation isn't one of them! And to help this, bitcoin is able to be split down to 10 decimal places so as deflation occurs it can still be exchanged in smaller and smaller amounts.
As far as taxes, the fact that every bitcoin client is aware of every transaction that occurs in the entire network makes some aspects of taxation much easier. The fact that wallet addresses are anonymous, however, makes some aspects of taxation harder, although people can already anonymously exchange cash. This is a whole different discussion and I'm sure there's a lot of good answers out there already.
So I think your concerns about bitcoin are less economic in nature and more technical, which I think could be resolved by learning more about the currency. If you have any questions I'd be happy to explain.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:15:34
I'm not trying to insult you dude it's okay to not know about something as long as you're willing to learn.
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:54:47
You're right but BTC is always going to go up in the long run because there's a hard limit on the supply. So in your example if you make 5 BTC just don't sell at a loss...

It could be that I'm the one who is ignorant, but I don't know where the gaps in my knowledge lie.
@_date: 2013-08-08 19:47:48
I'm sure much smarter people than me have already had this discussion, but isn't there a danger in not requiring all wallets to hold the full blockchain? I thought bitcoin's distributed nature was its greatest strength, doesn't incomplete blockchains undermine that strength?
@_date: 2013-06-23 05:20:17
You're right I'm being foolhardy.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:16:50
I'm completely missing the point here with my jealousy veiled as concern. This is a really awesome event for bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:09:04
Yea what he said. Why does it need to be regulated? You keep making that assertion but I don't see any argument or explanation.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:31:18
Right, we got off the gold standard because it prevented us from, say, increasing the money supply in response to the needs of the users. That's a very real problem with bitcoin, that the money supply will never increase after a certain point (around 2140).
However, there's also nothing stopping people from just starting from scratch with bitcoin2 at that point, assuming a better solution hasn't come along in that time.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:52:49
Oh yea, I'm sure he does, and as long as he's continually making enough bitcoin (or other income) he'll be fine. In Virginia the property tax is 4.25%, which on a $208k vehicle comes out to about 10 grand a year. And then there's insurance! Well, I'm sure the guy is aware of all this and can afford it, but I know I sure couldn't!
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:58:22
This is really cool, but the taxes on that thing are going to be enormous. I hope the guy can afford it. For that reason, if I got rich with bitcoin, not sure what I'd actually spend it on. It would need to be something I can't be taxed for. Still, I'm sure I could come up with something, I wish I had bought some bitcoin back in the day!
