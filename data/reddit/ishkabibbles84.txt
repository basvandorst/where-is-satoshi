Just curious, but why did you decide to start accepting bitcoins?

Or you know, you can learn how to read a graph and see that there was  HUGE sell off of bitcoins before the announcement was made by GOX. Any logical person could come to the same conclusion as OP.

I swear if they hire all these people and still can't setup a better verification system for instant buy, I will never use their site again.

Is it weird that I like to know who the fuck I'm entrusting to do work for me?

I think part of the problem why bitcoin is dropping so low (besides all the crap from china) is that there are more businesses beginning to adopt BTC then there are people who are using BTC to pay for things. This will eventually not be the case.
