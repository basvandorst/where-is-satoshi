Oh no that sucks..
Like someone had access to all default keys on those wallets? (Someone in the factory)
Or op bought a 2nd hand wallet and the previous owner can't believe his plan worked.

As others said, 0% chance coinbase will give you anything back.
So you found your phone back 2.5 weeks after and it was still powered on? How much battery left when you found it?
Also i dont know about iphones, but with androids and google it will by default record your gps positions over time. Might give some idea about where the phone went?
Also if they have wifi at the gym, do they log? (And was your phone set to join it auto?)
With your mac address you could see when exactly it quit the gym and when it came back.. and maybe correlate that with someone.

Interresting.  you are the only one talking about btc just deposited being used by someone behind the scene.
I know banks do this all the time but was convinced any btc deposited were dormant until traded..

To my knowledge nobody received anything back yet.
A bunch of mtgox btc were sold, but not yet redistributed to creditors.
