So your saying bitcoin cash is monopoly money. if that is the case then how come many companies are accepting bitcoin cash as a payment method

No troller but shilling faketoshi. Craig Wright already filled out the paperwork claiming he is the bitcoin creator. so he must be it

I bought 5 bitcoin in 2017 at $12,800 each. and another 3.2 bitcoin at $16,800 each. I've been hodling since 2017 even after the crash and never sold yet. How high do you think it will get. I don't mind hodling for another 5 years or so.
