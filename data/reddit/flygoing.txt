I'm not a cardano person, but your second sentence makes no sense. Why is Bitcoin needed to trade other cryptos to cash?  I can sell eth for usd whenever I want without Bitcoin being involved

That's not a good source. The datadir is where **all historical states*** are stored, e.g. the state of the EVM at all past blocks, and this is unnecessary unless you need to do queries on past states. The actual blockchain only grows ~10-20% faster than the Bitcoin blockchain. It's currently somewhere from 30-50 gb, depending on the client.

It's actually pretty easy. You probably can't do it on a raspberry pi, true, but you can run it on an average laptop.

The exception being that all intermediaries need to be online, which isn't a huge deal, but it's definitely an important thing to note. The general solution in Lightning network is to have fairly centralized hubs, which are still trustless in the sense that they can't steal your funds, but they must be online.

Read through all the comments. AntPool does answer. But this is silly and doesn't 100% confirm anything

With the Bitcoin Cash fork that just happened, the Segwit2X fork in November, and the general scaling issues in Core, there will likely be a lot of price volatility (even more so than usual). Your investment will likely be safe mid-term though because Core has more users and support by services.

if you transferred it after the fork block, then coinbase will have it

So yes, they will give people their BCH balance. They haven't explicitly said they're working on buy/sell, but that's my assumption when they say they're working on support for BCH.
