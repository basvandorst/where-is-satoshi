Agree, the current massive amount of obvious and open trolls is unbelievable, not any other subreddit or even any other place on the internet tolerates this blatant amount of trolls. They manipulate votes upvoting themselves and downvoting everything else. Many of them are watching and active for so many hours a day that is difficult to believe they are not getting a monetary incentive to do so. It is time the moderators step up and start cleaning this mess. For satoshi's sake!, even if they can get rid of the top 10% more active trolls, that would make a noticeable difference. Let them at least go through the effort to open new accounts and have limited posting ability.

jstolfi is a well known troll, the indian guy is bullish on digital currencies and states that inevitably they are moving to a cashless society, he is establishing a surprising ultra-liberal financial landscape for India. Very interesting video and well worth watching.
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:23:27
With a new account you have a lot of different limits and obstacles for posting, that would slow them down and discourage them greatly...or at least make them work harder for their money ;o)
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:35:27
Why not all? (As his post history  would suggest)
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:45:30
Wow, that place is packed! Interest in bitcoin is definitely growing almost everywhere. Do not mind the price for now, just keep buying small amounts every week. So even though I'm not making money right now, I'm happy that the whole world has the chance to buy at this prices. Same with gold and silver, very cheap right now. Thank you for the superb job you are doing!

No, a troll is somebody who posts 100% negative, destructive comments and misinformation, nothing to to with a constructive critics.
Would you allow home invaders in your home? Why do you use a lock?...That is censorship!, Should anyone be allowed to walk in and out your bedroom as they please?
So...some  basic rules make sense and banning trolls is not 'censorship' at all.

“Why bitcoin is poised for big momentum in 2015”
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:10:04
That is not how it will work, there can't be "paper/fake" bitcoin like in a gold/silver  ETF. In GLD/SLV you can't see the physical metal and the price is manipulated by dumping tons of paper/fake gold on the market and triggering 'margin calls' producing a cascade effect where your 'stops' get obliterated. They can do that since for every ounce of physical metal there are many, many more of fake ones on paper.
With bitcoin they can't play that game behind the curtains, since each bitcoin can be followed on a public ledger (Blockchain). This level of transparency is really revolutionary and paradigm changer.

If you would go to a "dollar" or "credit card" forum, you would find every single time somebody was robbed of their dollars or have their credit card info stolen.
It is up to you to keep your dollars and bitcoins safe. With credit cards you can just do so much on your end, but hundreds of millions of CC's info have been stolen on the seller or provider ends.

Agree, but I think it will go to 5,000 and then "collapse" to 1,500 and stay there for around 6 months before the next spike to over 10,000. Remember all, this year we have coming in the corporate investments, ETF's, and Wall Street. The spikes are sudden and fast, the way down is 'choppy' and slower, stabilizes...and the cycle repeats once more.

they are the best option for people who can't secure their coins by themselves (which is the great majority). Coinbase Vault is super safe and free service.
