How did you remove willy?
@_date: 2015-12-07 09:16:35
But why would there be more hashing power put into bitcoin if the price weren't rising?
@_date: 2015-06-29 07:57:43
Also greeks just straight up don't know about bitcoin and don't trust anything that isn't cash. So it's important to promote education about it first, not just encourage people to buy into something they don't know about.

Hey, thanks for the feedback. I agree with your point, but I guess I'd rather not change it now, as the results will be biased towards the original options.
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:36:45
I think that if you think a survey like this can lead to a result like that, then you are definitely right to not participate. Thanks for sharing your thoughts here though, I will take that into consideration in the future.
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:28:53
Circle is great. I have just noticed that at all opportunities and strange moments you really laud that service and bash others when really they're all awesome and great. It seems like you have an incentive and it is easy to notice because you post so often. You can use the news as an easy mask but it's been going on for a while.
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:59:47
Yes, probably. The results should probably be taken with a pinch of salt. :)
@_date: 2014-07-22 11:48:04
Great point - I just changed it. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:44:20
Hey, thank you, this is good feedback.
As for the silk road, I am interested in that too, but I thought too many people would then see the survey as trying to find something out about them, and get paranoid and not take it. I decided I didn't care enough so I left the question out. But maybe a future survey!
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:26:06
The fee you are talking about is one charged by a private entity on top of bitcoin for the convenience of converting from fiat. It is not actually a fee in bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:46:25
There is actually a pretty good spread so I'm happy with the ranges I chose.
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:50:01
My target is not a scientificly accurate demographic.
I expect most respondents will be people who are into bitcoin, and probably a small part will be those who are not.
That's fine and that's the goal.
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:22:35
You are the guy who keeps dropping the word "circle" when it's completely unnecessary all over this subreddit. What's your deal man. Can you tell us, because it's annoying.
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:42:43
It's a metaphorical question. The question is really: will the next generation use it?
Sorry, I thought this would be understood by more people.
@_date: 2014-07-22 12:08:23
The survey is hosted by google docs, I have no way of obtaining IP addresses from it.
@_date: 2014-07-23 22:34:38
Thanks to everyone who participated. I hope there are some interesting things to be found in the data.
I tried posting this to HN as well but it was filtered out for some reason. If somebody wants to take a stab at that it'd be cool, but no biggie.
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:41:23
But as far as this subreddit is concerned they're basically the same thing. Anybody promoting ease of use over ABSOLUTE TOTAL ANONYMITY is an outcast.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:44:24
Of what?
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:12:42
It depends on the transaction. For example, if there are 50 inputs and 50 outputs, but only one input has value, and only one output has value, and all others are zero, then it's pretty clear how things were transferred.
Obviously this isn't the case everywhere. It is only to say that there are a subset of transactions which clearly contain information on the flow of bitcoin. There is nothing saying whether the transactions in question were outside or inside of this subset.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:44:16
It's fully within the bounds of legality and morality for the business to look into user accounts privately. In fact they may be compelled to do it even if they don't want to to comply with local KYC regulations. If they notice something, it is their responsibility to reach out to the appropriate law enforcement. I'm not exactly saying they should do it out in the open.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:46:17
Bitcoin transactions have inputs and outputs. You check the inputs.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:45:08
Who is MK? I would also assume the same thing about an internal theft, so I don't think that means anything.
@_date: 2015-04-15 07:35:56
The future: where using money is more difficult than it is today.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:45:49
Yep, but that's very difficult to do to the tune of *800,000* without *somebody* along the line leaking something.
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:24:05
Precedent or not, it is inevitable. Traceability is built into bitcoin; to assume that it can be avoided by the good graces of the general public to not attempt tracking is to deny the actual nature of bitcoin and the blockchain. On the contrary, anyone conducting transactions in bitcoin should assume that their publicly viewable information can and will be viewed by the public.
Inspecting public data for evidence of crime is a good precedent to be set.
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:20:27
That's right. That's why I advocate sharing with law enforcement, not other private entities for their own advantage.
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:23:49
Just so nobody's unnecessarily scared, this seems like a new article about old news.
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:55:36
The question that burns in my mind is still whether it was an external theft or an inside job, and this post doesn't seem to shed any light on that.
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:34:50
"Vigilante justice" is when you attempt to carry out the justice yourself. Handing over suspicious information to authorities so that they can enact justice at their discretion (they may find nothing wrong) is entirely different.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:48:03
I don't think anyone is advocating this anywhere. The implicit emotion here is that thefts should not be investigated.
This is beyond any concept of "liberty" and "anonymity" and just loops back to outright crime. You are advocating crime.
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:51:43
The price will continue to fall until there is no hope left. It will only go up when it can't go down. Not enough people have given up yet, we still have further to drop.
@_date: 2015-09-29 08:00:59
In the long run won't that openness reduce it to a commodity service?
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:19:32
I already agreed with that.
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:14:57
Exactly, it's law enforcement's problem to handle. And if they have a problem and can't do it, then great. So I'm not sure why you're advocating not sharing with them, if sharing with them will likely end in futility for them anyway. There are lots of scenarios. The one you mention is only one kind. Others are much easier, and if there is a chance that you might have a lead to an easier one, it seems rational to at the very least offer it as a lead, since a simple offer generally requires very little effort for either side.
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:54:41
Great point. If we know the addresses that the coin was sent from and we know what exchanges it wound up at, it shouldn't be too hard for those exchanges to find the incoming bitcoin, see what accounts they were going to, and connect them to bank accounts / personally identifying information. But why hasn't that happened?
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:18:25


Yes, in the case of prostitutes' personal accounts, and marijuana businesses.


This just means we have to help them get big enough to be able to ignore or pay off the scrutiny like the big guys. :) The alternative is getting regulations relaxed but that's about infinitely more difficult.
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:07:23
If by "working with the feds" you mean "compelled to comply with US federal regulation, just like any US-based money transmitter" then sure. This will be true for any and all bitcoin businesses that connect to the traditional finance world in any way.
How this is a surprise to anyone or seen as particularly bad at this point is mind-boggling to me.
There's this huge effort to make bitcoin companies seem like big, dark, anti-user conspiracies actively trying to hunt down innocent users and destroy bitcoin, ignoring the fact that it's in the exact opposite of their long-term interests.
Also, Don't fool yourselves that even this kind of "news" doesn't have a corporate bias. Much of this stuff is pushed in these forums by the kinds of bitcoin companies who really only have "privacy" to rely on. They can't get banking relationships and pretend not to want them, and in turn try to burn everything around them by spreading FUD and screaming that everything else is anti-privacy, in hopes that everyone is a tinfoil hatter and will run to their pure browser-based, un-pooled, secure-it-yourself wallets and that they will be the last buildings standing.
Of course this is futile, because if you can't even buy bitcoin in the first place, then you can't use *any* bitcoin service including their own. In reality these efforts just result in people who are curious being scared off and not picking up bitcoin at all.
It's also the kind of thing continuously pushed by the trolls who want everyone to be worried about everything all the time. Buttcoiners, government agencies Snowden leaked docs on, who are trained to hang out in forums and psychologically derail ideas they disagree with, etc... Obviously that doesn't mean this doc is lacking real content, but it's also framed in a way that's designed to scare you.
Obviously the things talked about here are things we should all know about. But what's actually new here? There really isn't anything. If you've been using these services with the assumption that any information you submit can and will be taken by force by the government (which is true of any business connected to the internet - it's not even strictly limited to finance companies), then this is simply non-news.
So we get an anonymous wall of text from somebody telling us what we already know. It's supposed to be scary, but it's just not.
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:19:06
I don't know enough about margin calls. Is this a bug that happened? Or something natural that people didn't foresee?
@_date: 2015-10-19 03:07:31
Liquid does't do fiat either so I'm not sure what your point is.
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:18:57
Why not just send the bitcoin?
