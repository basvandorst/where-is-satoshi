You can show some sort of proof now that you're not a troll without revealing your identity, otherwise I will assume this is a joke.

Are we just in complete denial in the sub that the coins we already have will also be cheap?

Good call genius, got any more "investment" advice you want to share?

What Warren Buffet knows is what his team of hundreds of the worlds best investment experts knows. I'm amazed that you would be so arrogant as to suggest you know more about an investment opportunity than the most successful living investor and his whole team, many of whom will be in their 20s and fully understand the potential and risks of Bitcoin better than 99.9% of people on this sub. Get out of your own ass and accept this for the legitimate bad news that it is.

Any proof that you can actually pay for 300 Bitcoins? I hope hope someone takes you up on your bet.

A screenshot of an account balance showing you can purchase a BRK share.

I'm glad someone here has the sense to point this out

Lol keep telling yourself that it's up 9000%, how many people actually bought at $0.5? I garantee OP didn't

Where's the proof I asked for 24 hours ago, you responded to my comment then downvoted me and didn't provide proof you can even afford $190,000 in shares. How is anyone going to trust you now?

Dude you're obviously not aware that everyone makes money on bitcoins without anybody ever losing money. Us sophisticated investors are so certain of this fact that we know you are trolling, we're definitely not in denial. 
Anyway enjoy your downvotes, nobody wants to hear about someone losing money. I'll save my upvotes for a story about someone making money because it suits my agenda.
