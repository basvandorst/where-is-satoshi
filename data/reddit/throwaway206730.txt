It's not the banks that are slow, it's the merchants.  It'll be late 2015 before merchants take it seriously and start requiring PIN CC transactions.  Meanwhile it's simply cheaper to let the fraud happen.
With fuckups like Home Depot, my bank has to send me a new card about twice a year now.  But I never lost a dime to CC fraud, so I'd say credit cards work pretty darn good.

Actually total_product_recall makes a lot more sense than OP, which is confusing several different issues and is not really posing a question that can be answered.

The Circle buy price handling works fine, much better than fighting the Coinbase price change dialog.

You are thinking of something called "cash".  All forms of electronic payment leave a trail that can be audited.  And I think the reporting limit may be $3K now (since 9-11), not $10K.
Don't fuck with the tax man.  If you are making enough money to be on their radar, then it's best to report properly and pay your taxes.

The burden would be that of possible further losses, I'm guessing, because it costs nothing to hodl bitcoin.
Really you just threw away a lot of potential upside for a little prevention of further downside.

It's a BS explanation.  The simple bitcoin transaction is a secure way to transfer value between trusted parties.  When the parties don't trust each other, a 3'rd party is needed (google multisig/escrow); however a 3'rd party is not required.  So now we have half-assed implementations like the Newegg payment by bitcoin option, which doesn't have escrow.  And then Circle tries to explain it like this and the poor user is left with misinformation and FUD.

The number of BTC users is somewhere between 0.005% and 0.025% of the world population, so 0.01% is probably a pretty good approximation.

You can look cool and impress the girls when you are able to use something as complicated as bitcoin instead of a simple credit card.
Other than that, there are no real benefits for consumers when using bitcoin.  Credit cards offer protection, cash back, and the ability to dispute a transaction.

Circle is not an "authority", it's just an exchange.  But it does need to be trusted.  The presence of Circle enhances bitcoin by increasing competition and decentralizing the business (avoiding a monopoly).

Ok, but would it be possible for, say, a country to effectively firewall bitcoin so that it would be cut off from the real world?  Could bitcoin continue to go on inside that country and be a part of the real world bitcoin system somehow?

Bitcoin nodes are organized as a distributed network that implements a replicated database (the blockchain).  On top of that you have the bitcoin clients and miners, and since they can connect to any node the whole thing acts as a huge decentralized network service.

blockchain.info will also do multiple recipients (select "custom" transaction and hit "+" to add more recipients).

Yes, Circle will have a certain amount of "control" of your bank account, and that could be a risk.  That is, if Circle gets hacked the bank might choose to close your account (or maybe even all accounts linked to the exchange).  The risk is small, but something you should consider.

Hopefully the rest of your family is wealthy.  Otherwise, just think what they could have done with the money you lost.  And think how much you could have made if you worked a regular job instead of playing day trader for endless hours.
Next time you have money to gamble, just go straight to Vegas and have a good time with it.

Use bitaddress.org Wallet Details (offline) to verify your private keys give correct public keys.  Then use blockchain.info (online) to verify that the public key is not already in use.  You are then good to go, bro.

Interesting that Coinbase accepted a credit card that doesn't belong to the Coinbase account holder.
But yeah, basically you can't buy bitcoin using a credit card at Coinbase.

Visa would not like that, plus it would not get your cash back.
Better to call a Code 10 next time and stop the fraud before it happens.

Go get this offline SHA1 calculator (it reportedly works with Win8 too):  and put it in C:\SHA1.  Put the bitaddress.org.html file in the C:\SHA1 folder too.
Run C:\sha1&gt;fciv -sha1 bitaddress.org.html
It will spit out the hash, which should match the value found in package.json.

Bitcoin costs me 1% to use and gives me no consumer protection.
Credit cards give me 1% back on most purchases and protects me from fraud (and my own clumsiness too).
I like bitcion but I'm no fanatic.  So I am one of the majority that will not regularly spend bitcoin.  For now.
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:00:15
I believe BIP38 is safe for any practical amount.  That said, I wouldn't keep a huge amount of BTC in one address no matter what.  And if I was going to put a large amount in the physical coin, I would not put the public address on the coin.

Virtual cards do work to prevent fraud, BUT they blow up when your physical card is compromised and has to be replaced; all your virtual card numbers go away too.
A virtual card is NOT a push transaction, it's just like a regular CC transaction.  Paying with bitcoin is an example of a push transaction.

Instant bitcoin buys are instant.  You get bitcoins right then.  You can spend them, you can move them, etc.  The exchange (coinbase, circle, etc) is extending you credit until they get paid via a bank transfer.  That's why they really would like to know who you are and that you can be trusted.
It's not a matter of virtual or abstract coins (is there really such a thing?), it's a matter of who has custody and control of the coins.

You can feed the decrypted private key back into the bitaddress.org Wallet Details page to make sure it gives the correct public key.  Then try the public key in blockchain.info to make sure the address is valid and not already in use.  That's about all you can do.
