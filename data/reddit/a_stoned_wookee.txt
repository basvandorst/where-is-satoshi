On the other hand it is a pretty low-cost marketing to get attention of possibly 10+ thousand young people.

I have played with the thought of different projects in the field of crypto, but I think the biggest ‚problem‘ is always the regulatory framework.
What are you allowed to do, what not, permissions, etcetc.
This is obviously most of the times a problem in emerging markets.

50%? Ye, estimated 50% of word population are women but 50% into crypto?
I honestly believe only ~5% maximum of the world population is participating in the crypto era until now, and 5% of those 5% are women.
Just my humble guess.
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:14:44
In the same boat.
Since crypto is essentially a financial product wouldn‘t one need to have a license as a financial advisor to do stuff like this?
