This is what's killed most of my interest. I got burned and lost a small number of coins when Tradehill went down. I was an "idiot" storing my coins on an exchange, and there was no recourse (I emailed several times to multiple different addresses various people on here and elsewhere suggested, to no avail.) There's basically no recourse if a third party does something shady with your coins, which makes the idea of using my coins generally unappealing.

I spent a lot of time on the last version of this and it was quite a bit of fun. :)

Historically, Apple takes extremely risk-averse positions with regard to what it allows in the app store. I suspect it's not hate or competition as much as it's fear of lawsuits, negative press, and poor user experience. If crappy bitcoin apps lose/steal someone's money, apple doesn't want to be in the position of being held legally or psychologically responsible. There is also a legal and public perception grey area given how much the press associates bitcoin with Silk Road and the last thing Apple wants is FUD stories about "how your 13 year old can buy drugs with their iPhone."
Apple usually turns around on things like this when something becomes more mainstream and lack of support threatens their market share, but they are rarely a leader in this arena. Recall that apps with adult content were banned for quite a while, even if the adult content came from external downloads. Now that's been fixed with a click-through warning.

I'm a little surprised this went quiet here. I'm having fun, despite frustration! :)

I was on sabbatical away from the Internet when they went down, so I was very late to the party to try to get my coins back from them. I've sent a few emails to claim at tradehill dot com over the last few months (most recently, last month) and have not heard back. I'm not terribly optimistic at this point.
