I can buy all that without cash.

JFYI: The Greek currency is the EURO. It has fallen a bit compared to the USD, but it is still worth something.

I was wondering that, too. But would it be legal? To seize assets of Grrek citizens that have bank accounts in German banks? Would the banks be required to reveal that inormation?
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:45:19
Are you a German citizen? Or only a German resident with greek citizenship? Depending on the amount of money it might be illegal for you, to operate a bank account for you father. Be careful! Also IANAL.

Thanks! It seems I haven't been looking diligently enough. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:58:50
It would be interesting to see that go to court. Has that ever happened? 
Is there anyone stealing bitcoins and selling them without mixing them first?
@_date: 2014-08-22 09:24:02
I don't know this app. But it is possible to have a wallet without downloading the whole blockchain. It is called simplified payment verification (SPV).
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:06:00
So when 1a5f9842524 deleted his account, he also deleted the details of this vulnerability. Where can I find them elsewhere?
It seems I cannot comment on the original post.

How much are these fees?
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:20:04
The difference is you do not have to give your private key to everyone you're paying. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:35:02
It also supports NFC. Since everybody seems to be raving about NFC these days...
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:25:07
Did you implement two way communication via NFC on Android? So are you speaking from experience? What I meant to say is it is less inconvenient for the user to do it in this hybrid (nfc/bt) way. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 00:46:52
Buying Kaiten is a great way to support the k-9 developers. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 20:37:50
You are right. It is possible to make a payment without giving the equivalent of a private key to the merchant.
When you pay online you give all the information needed to make a payment: card number, expiration date and CVC. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 11:08:04
Using NFC only for this would be quite complicated and take more time in which you would need to keep the two devices very close together. That's why Bitcoin wallet supports having the payment reqeust url point to a Bluettoth address and transfer the payment request via bluetooth. That way it should be possible for the buyer to be offline. The seller still needs to be online though.

The one in Room 77 is not there anymore. But you can still pay for your food and drinks with bitcoin there.
@_date: 2014-01-26 00:49:50
That is just wrong. It supports IMAP idle.
@_date: 2014-08-23 23:18:10
1. Where can I find more information on how exactly the password works? 
2. In   it says the source code is available. Where can I find it? I only found the kryptokit chrome extension on github. But since it also works on Firefox, I wonder if that is all the source code available.
3. How do make the QR code button work in Safari on iOS?
@_date: 2014-10-26 22:05:23
Probably by adjusting the exchange rate a little bit.
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:32:32
The point is to have more choices to get Bitcoins. How do you get cash fiat money? 
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:12:52
There is no problem in using old BT for sending and receiving payment requests. It can be on all the time. It is only drawing more power (than BLE) while a connection (e.g. rfcomm) is established and data is send. BLE is better suited when a device is supposed to send small amounts of data (less than 20 bytes) every now and then. Old BT is perfectly capable to transmit payment requests and Andreas Schildbachs Bitcoin Wallet already supports this. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 23:09:33
But that is the exception, right? When I used an ATM (The one in Room 77) it had no recognizable fees. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 09:54:46
The wallet software creates a signed transaction that is send to several full nodes and then spread around the bitcoin network by them. Yes. 
If you want a better understanding of what is happening I'd recommend looking at the bitcoinj library examples. BitcoinJ is a Java bitcoin library that supports SPV and is used by several Android and Java wallets. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:26:31
It was moved, as planned, but I do not know where.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:46:39
How do I use the NFC API directly? Do you have a source sample how to do that? I hear it should be possible but I haven't seen source code how.
@_date: 2015-01-31 08:32:58
Why do you think this project ist laughable?
@_date: 2014-11-05 11:04:59
Which aren't?
When using Android Beam the format of the transfered uri specifies which apps will respond. And BIP72 is even backwards compatible with BIP21.

I received the same message from Bitstamp and tried to get any information about it from DB. 
They did not confirm any refusal to receive Bitcoin related payments. They asked for a time and date at which Bitstamp allegedly tried to send the money. 
So I asked Bitstamp to provide this data. Then Bitstamp told me, they did not even try. Hard to make DB accountable for this. 
But Bitstamp was negligient in not telling me immediatly when they employed this policy of not trying to send SEPA transfers to DB. They knew this before I tried to make the transfer and they did not warn me about it. 
Does anyone know if Bitstamp tells their customers, when they open a new account with Bitstamp and use a DB account?

I was thinking about running an XT node on Digital Ocean. How is their infrastructure handling it? I don't mind my node being ddosed or going down for some time. But I'd not want to be kicked out by Digital Ocean because they cannot handle it.

I am sure you can be  an entrepreneur and a thief at the same time. What makes him a thief? What did he steal and how?
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:34:45
And what is Andreas Schildbach? Is he also a for profit developer? He also had to remove his donation buttons from Öffi and Bitcoin Wallet because of fear his apps would be kicked out the app store if he didn't. I assume he does both projects in his free time. But still he would appreciate financial support. And the TOS are really not clear. I read them and I would not assume they disallow donations.
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:36:00
Are donations via in-app payments really allowed? Also for non charity organizations?
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:08:40
I really hope Deutsche Bank keeps it that way. I would not want to switch to another bank...

BitPak - 
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:08:54
Coinjar seems to be only a hosted wallet. Is there a real wallet for iOS in the App Store?
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:35:32
Coinjar is (at best) a hosted wallet. That does not count as a wallet for me.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:31:22
Did you read the article about Bitpak? That is not what they told him. They told him it'd illegal in some countries. But they would not tell him in which countries.
If the reason for banning bitcoin apps is because you could send or receive bitcoins with them, then how is that not anti bitcoin by Apple? What is the key feature you want in a wallet? Send and receive payments! 
So let me clarify: Apple is anti bitcoin-wallets :-) 
They might allow useless bitcoin apps like tickers. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:24:59
How do you manage a real wallet with a browser? Only if the walled is hosted. On Android I can manage my wallet completely on my phone. I do not want to host my wallet on some server that I have no physical control over. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:58:28
And you really think any web service that you use from your insecure mobile phone can be more secure than a local app? Having a web app (that you authenticate against from your smart phone) is just adding one more attack vector to your wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:13:12
Seriously. Which rules did it violate?
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:55:25
Then why does Apple not allow it in countries where Bitcoin is considered legal. Like Germany for example? The App Store allows to restrict distribution by country. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:22:30
What about bitpak? ( 
This was a wallet that did allow making or receiving payments in bitcoin. AFAIK there was no way to buy or sell BTC itself. Whay did Apple ban that? Why did they not allow it in countries that obviously treat BTC as something legal? Like Germany for example.
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:33:13
Berlin has (at least) two regular Bitcoin meetups:
* Bitcoin Stammtisch (round table) 
* Bitcoin startups Berlin 
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:09:55
You mean the rule that no bitcoin app is allowed? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:22:51
This also applies for Germany. Can't speak for other european countries.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:31:58
Can I make payments with Coinjar?
