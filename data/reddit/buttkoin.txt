Not giving up my coins to some random, no thanks.

Who cares, stop bitching, downvote it if you don't want it at the top.

It's convenient for me and others, and I don't have to trust mixers not to steal my coins. I don't see why everyone on this sub is out to get BC.I.

Go suck a dick, you're only sorry that you got caught.
