Oh I agree, it would just be better for those of us who want to buy in btc but also not want to pay 6x the usd rate. If the point is to stimulate btc economy the incentive has to be there. Honestly if I were a company I'd let so many orders a day go through for btc even at a lower usd ratio because of btc upside. If there is one thing people can't resist it's sales. People get credit cards with 30 percent apr just to get a fee bucks a month in gas "rewards"  I'm saying price incentive could really rope in the coupon mom crowd.

I'm not trying to be mean. When I read this I pictured it ws the plot of some super cheesy lifetime hallmark movie. The six sense kid played your son, you were Bruce Willis and you golden retriever also you were a decorated veteran. Your wife had the body of an 8 but like a 7.5 face, also she is kind of high strung at times. Also grandma has cancer and she died just as bitcoins reach 1 million usd. Hailey Joel osmett or whatever his name is sad because btc went to the moon but grandma went to the grave. The sister is played by Miley Cyrus. She gets eaten by a worm that lives underground. It's sad but like everyone is like "Hey it would be sadder if that worm ate Hailey Joel osmett". Also your son gets bullied at school for being a nerd but then he gets so rich that he makes a robot dog to be his friend because no one else likes him now. He is so misunderstood and mature. Kids just can't understand his deep and profound love for magic Internet money. He wears bitcoin boxer shorts, he chews bitcoin flavored gum. The robot dogs name is bitbark or something. Also I'm really high. So I don't know if any of that makes sense.

I agree. I am not thrilled about seeing memes and the same "is not too late to buy"  threads every day. I just think it's a normal cycle, people are getting more and more familiar with bitcoin every day, as early adopters let's try and be reasonable and understand not everyone will be ready to have non price related discussions or concerns until this whole thing calms down. It's exciting and I expect this kind of fervor.

BitBuyBit. Com 
Has the opportunity for most annoying /catchy jingle. Plus alliteration. And wordplay.

How do I receive the btc? I'm registered and downloading it as we speak. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:17:47
. 1 BTC though, so really a better deal to just pay fiat

You expect people that have 10s of thousands hanging in the balance to be calm and collected in one of the biggest market fluctuations they'll probably ever be a part of? I understand it gets old seeing the same shit over and over but the more understanding and educational we are with new members the quicker we can get them up to speed. We were all kids once remember that.
