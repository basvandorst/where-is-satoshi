@_date: 2015-06-15 06:00:08
Few problems with this service:
* Since it's peer to peer, the person streaming has to have an absolutely insane internet connection to stream to a large amount of people at once without problems.
* There's no description of what the hell the stream is.
* There's no preview of the stream, so why would I want to pay for it when it might be nothing worth watching?
* There's no directory of live streams.
* There's no free streaming mode for those who are new to the service and want to try it out without having to bother with Bitcoins.
Some people may not want to be listed in the directory (for private streaming sessions), or they may want to password protect their stream. The option to unlist and the option to have a password would be nice additional features.
Also that blue/green bubble background is ugly as hell.

@_date: 2015-06-18 05:40:39
According to an analysis by Tradeblock, at ~2.3 transactions/sec (TPS), we'll begin experiencing confirmations that take &gt; 1 block.  -- According to this, we're ~75 transactions/min (TPM). 2.3 TPS = 138 TPM, so when TPM increases from 75 to 138 (~85% increase, 1.85x), we may begin experiencing issues.
If we want to allow transaction volume to spike by 5x (as quite a safe limit for now? since during the late 2013 rally, transactions spiked by 2x regular volume), then that's 75*5 = 375. Then, 375/138 = 2.7. So, increasing block size by 2.7x, or from 1 to 2.7 MB, would appear to be a safe block size increase for now.
A block size of 2.7MB, or 4MB if rounding up to the amount Gavin said was "OK" during the Chinese miner talk, seems like a good stopgap measure. It should not be controversial to increase from 1 to 2.7 MB (allowing a 5x spike over average volume), or 4MB (allowing a 7.3x spike), both far exceeding the historical 2x spike in late 2013's monster rally.
The point being, if a bubble occurs, when this new volume comes through we WILL face big problems. These problems will, more than likely, kill the bubble in its track and hold Bitcoin adoption back years. You don't have a problem with this?

I implore all of you to watch the referenced video from this point instead, which gives Mike Hearn's statement some much needed context: 
In summary:
* The Lightning Network does not address the issue of block size. Block size is still an issue even if the Lightning Network is implemented and working we will still need much bigger blocks.
* The Lightning Network security model actually becomes worse if the block size limit is not increased.
* The Lightning Network is not a solution to the block size issue.
* The Lightning Network will not deliver any solutions in a time frame that is necessary.

This needs to be prevented on a protocol level. It's silly to rely on people to be thoughtful. It's like leaving your keys in your car and asking everyone around you "please don't steal my car, you know that's the right thing to do", but not everyone is capable of that level of morality, and in this case that level of rational thought. It needs to be enforced. 
If the entirety of Bitcoin can be brought down by something as simple as this then to put it bluntly, it has no future. That might sound like an exaggeration, but it's really not. This is a gaping hole, and a big one at that. If you think it's a problem now, imagine the problem if half of the world was using Bitcoin. You can't leave the integrity and security of an entire economic system in the hands of peoples "good behavior". Not only is the system vulnerable to the bad choices of the pool owners, but anyone who wants to take down Bitcoin could target the pools, hack them, and using their resources perform double spends to destroy Bitcoins integrity. Bitcoin devs, we need you!

@_date: 2015-08-10 15:05:34
You're being downvoted, but I tend to agree with you, considering the attitudes of the devs and the things they have said themselves. For example, Luke-Jr has specifically stated many a time on IRC that they won't settle for any size increase. I pitched the idea of a 2mb increase to them for compensation purposes, so the debate can be resolved in due time, and his response was that it was a waste of time to have to do it twice. I pitched 4mb and he said the limit is too high. The group of devs on that side of the fence don't want to see an increase, no matter what it is, seems to be the sentiment. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:53:21
I've seen that, it doesn't contain the quote in mention. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 05:15:07
Both of these groups of developers (pro-Blockstream versus XT) are polarized on opposite ends of the spectrum. What we really need is for them to come together and meet at the middle and put their agendas aside for the betterment of Bitcoin. All of this political drama is such a drain and a waste of time. We don't need XT, and we don't need 1mb blocks. We need a slight increase in the blocksize without a hard fork, an adequate plan for periodical and automated block-size increases, and to go forward with great technology like the Lightning Network in due time. How many times do we need to point out this conflict is not solving anything? Why can't they work together like grown men? How long is this nonsense going to go on for? 
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:24:44
Luke-Jr doesn't work for Blockstream, but he's part of their camp in the sense of their philosophical alignment regarding the direction of Bitcoin. Maxwell is on the same train of thought as Luke-Jr is, and he works for Blockstream.

Is this the sort of thing we have to look forward to under the direction of the current devs? Do people actually WANT this?

That's a very weak reason to call it a scam. The only reason it hasn't got as much adoption as Bitcoin is because Bitcoin was first on the block. When Bitcoin. If Litecoin had first mover advantage then Bitcoin would be the "scam", according to you.

Calling XT an altcoin is misleading and disingenuous. If anything, old Bitcoin would be considered the "altcoin" if XT reaches adoption consensus. What's disappointing is that you have explicitly ruled out showing any kind of support for it, even if the community desires to move in this direction. In other words, you're not operating this subreddit, your bitcointalk forum or your bitcoin.org website in a democratic fashion, you're operating them in a dictatorial fashion. Which is, ironically, precisely what you criticize Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn for doing for proposing XT to begin with.

If you go to  on IRC and ask them why they don't want a block-size increase they will say "we want a fee market". I've specifically heard this from gmaxwell, LukeJr and PeterTodd on multiple occasions. As Jeff Garzik says in that twitter thread: 
"The recent, yet unannounced pattern of "let a fee market develop" diverges from years-long policy in opposite direction. 1/"

You're describing Luke-Jr, Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell. If you ask them on IRC they will proudly admit to driving Bitcoin in this direction. If you don't believe me just ask them yourself. They're doing this openly, and they've got an army of trolls to support them now. The question is whether we will stand by and support them in this decision, or if we will resist and fight for a different direction. Either way, it looks like they don't really care what "we" think, and they're going to go ahead and do it anyway.

It's easy to claim things, especially without any proof. What is the proof you have that Litecoin is a scam? I think Coblee would take offence to this, considering the amount of hard work he's put in. Litecoin is a hedge against Bitcoins potential failure, and the constant bickering and divide between the current Bitcoin devs (you included), and the fact that you guys have conflicts of interest, is proof of why we need one.

Sounds like confirmation bias. You no doubt consider yourself a "skeptic". I've seen a lot of extremist skeptics by the way, so to say that all skeptics care about facts is not correct. A lot of skeptics only care about facts that fit within their worldview or bias. I will also mention that the type of skeptic that browses Natural News considers your type of skeptic to be a phony. Once again, both differing sides of the coin.

Thanks Mike. Just a small increase would be nice. I think if Gavins proposal was more realistic (say an increase to 4mb without the automated future increase system) the other devs would be more receiving. But maybe I'm completely wrong here and the other devs are entirely resistant to ANY increase, in which case we're screwed and it looks like the only route will be the XT fork.

You don't know that. It very well may. A lot of the big pool owners support it, a lot of Bitcoin companies support it, and a lot of the Bitcoin community support it. We won't know what happens until it's released. 


No one is calling anyone a liar. All I've done was link to a post where devs are saying he has been censoring things. If he says he didn't censor something then so be it. I'm not going to argue with him over that.  


I'm calling him a dictator because he has refused to allow the majority to decide the direction of Bitcoin and instead is making all of the decisions himself. For example, this recent policy post:  -- nothing to do with the XT post censorship stuff. 


@_date: 2015-07-22 02:15:41
LukeJr is definitely the most vocal on IRC about the reason they don't want to change the block size being because they want a fee market to develop, but I've also heard gmaxwell and PeterTodd say it on there multiple times as well.

"The recent, yet unannounced pattern of "let a fee market develop" diverges from years-long policy in opposite direction."

That's what market manipulation has done. Scared off all of the investors. The bears are greedy. Oh well, was fun whilst it lasted. Pity the whales don't realize that by taking greedy profits here they're ruining their potential for all future profits because Bitcoin won't have survived their manipulation, so there won't be any engine to manipulate in the future. You can't have a system so out of balance and expect it to continue to feed you forever. You need to maintain the balance or it will die, and that's what's happening here with Bitcoin. This is what happens when immature teenagers are exposed to fast money.

That's fine, then we'll have a market with reasonable prices. 20% is far from reasonable, it's theft, and the only reason it's happening is due to a lack of competitors. If it was actually difficult to do I'd change my tune. Prices should be based how difficult it is, how long it takes, and what the costs are to the provider, not just made up numbers out of greed because "I can get away with it".

I should have specified "without changes to the protocol". But, I also wasn't aware of BIP70. Does it already exist in the protocol or is it a 'proposed' feature?
The description of it is interesting: 
In the end anything can be overcome, it just depends on how much has to happen. Hopefully Bitcoin can solve all the problems before a competitor comes along, or at least be quick to adapt in that event.
Also I just watched this from Andreas, he covers the 'irreversibility' problem: 
So I'm going to just say that I trust his judgement over mine, the man knows his shit.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:18:00
Well, if you had 1000 Bitcoins, then yeah 20% is pretty steep. Really a flat rate would make more sense, or a tiered system depending on the amount recovered. I'm sure there are plenty of people who can crack wallets quite easily, usually it's not a really laborious task.
@_date: 2015-02-27 04:35:22
Thanks Gavin, you're the man.
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:39:11
It's more in the event of an accident. If you accidently send Bitcoin to the wrong person how are you supposed to get it back? Ask them nicely? Is that anonymous person really going to care if you ask them nicely? Bitcoin is like the wild west in this regard, and it's a problem. Unless you introduce centralization (transacting through Bitcoin banks that trust eachother for example), I don't see how it can go away.

The internet is a way to connect machines without limitations on what data can be exchanged. Bitcoin is a limited means of information exchange (only certain data can be stored in the blockchain). The problem the internet solves is larger than that of Bitcoin, connecting the world in any conceivable digital way versus a limited protocol for transaction exchange.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:00:42
Well I think it's disappointing the "reputable" people are charging 20% for this kind of a service. All they do is slap the file on a server and run an application against it. Now I'm starting to consider starting a competitor if that's the sort of profit I can expect, but I'll charge 10% instead.

Nope, that's called encouraging the growth of the Bitcoin sector. And I was considering it if I could bypass CGT, in which case it would have been a better way to cash out.

The entirity of the cryptocoin ecosystem is a bubble. Bitcoin is no different. That's what a speculative investment is. A bubble. The media drives it, 'silver for bitcoins gold', it's a recipe for success. People want to get in on the next 'big thing', and lots of them feel they've missed the Bitcoin train. The Litecoin train is next.

I like the amount of effort you've put into this, but I wouldn't be able to take such a device seriously. It sounds like a novelty. Perhaps if it wasn't really shaped as a gun, or described as a gun, it may have some appeal. But when it's described as a gun the first things that pop into my mind are 'clumsy, toy, novelty'. Perhaps if it was a small handheld device or something it'd have some real value, or something that plugs into a smart phone like the credit card scanners. But in saying that, the price of the item would outweigh it's benefits, I'd rather load up an app than pay $50 for a tool that can send payments faster.

So, normally to buy a Lambo you'd convert your BTC into USD, pay 50% on CGT, and then buy the lambo with the USD. 
Now, can you avoid paying the 50% on CGT if you pay with BTC directly? 
Please, someone tell me! I'm seriously considering it.

This is ridiculously stupid, these guys are idiots of the worst kind. Greedy individuals. Why can't you focus your energy into something that betters the Bitcoin economy, not destroys it.
Bitcoin devs, can you PLEASE start working on an implementation of Zerocoin (or something similar). I've said it from the very beginning, if we don't do something about this now, slowly but surely, this sort of thing will sink its teeth into the Bitcoin framework. It's going to be too late to do anything about these sort of attacks if they don't take swift action.
As it stands at the moment there are a huge large flaws with their plan though, firstly, donating small amounts of "dirty" coins to clean addresses could effectively render the address useless. 
Secondly, there will always be the option of exchanging coins with others. Why could you not just claim you swapped your clean coins with dirty coins? Not to mention all of the day traders using exchanges would be getting a bunch of dirty coins at some point, no doubt.
The Bitcoin network REALLY needs a mixing standard. Otherwise, it's going to be easy to track EVERYONES buying habits if the system becomes widely used. That's recipe for disaster. I can't look at other peoples credit card purchases, why should the entire world be able to look at my Bitcoin purchases? DarkWallet is a great start, but it needs to be built into the protocol.

Seems a bit presumptuous. How do you know they weren't planning on using it a few years from now? Or when they were in some financial trouble? It should be treated like cash, you can't back cash up, and if the receiver loses it or decides not to spend it that's their problem.

It may exceed Bitcoins rate of ADOPTION, but it will never exceed its market share. Litecoin will never get to a point where it's as valuable is Bitcoin, because as the price gap closes interest wanes due to the lack of incentive.

Yea u mad.
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:23:26
Yeah I'm going to keep my day trading coins, I'll probably end up moving those to cold storage and quit the day trading.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:00:56
Lol. In good faith, if you really are confident in your obscurity, you should leave the Bitcoin in the account. But in saying that, I agree with you, if it's obscure enough statistics will prevail.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:24:34


Yep, but that's ZeroCoin was created, and why CoinJoin has been devised and implemented in some places, and that's why the devs are looking into alternatives to these as well. Also green lists destroy the fungibility of Bitcoin, a necessity to being a currency. I don't see them being successful at this. Also, I hope they do buy all the Bitcoins, because then I can sell mine at a nice profit ;)
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:38:28

Somebody doesn't understand what day trading is. 2000 BTC is my cold storage long term position coin, I play with 200 BTC on the exchanges for income. Good thing you took the time to analyze my comments and still come out wrong though. And the 'troll here' comment was clearly a joke, it wasn't even a response to a Bitcoin thread...

Nah, the irony is in the fact that:
 You were going to post it on Youtube instead of alerting the site founders, yet you claim you would feel bad if people got ripped off.
 You point out something as obvious as "some people will scam people if given the opportunity".
Thanks for your awesome post buddy.

@_date: 2013-11-21 23:03:55
The value of the dollar does not come into account when doing fiat refunds, but the dollar is fairly stable around its price, so it's an interesting question. If I was the merchant I would feel ripped off having to refund more coins because of the exchange rate increasing, and if I were the customer I'd feel ripped off if I didn't receive the equivalent value because now I can't buy something worth the same amount.
I guess it'll come down to company policy, you'll have to have a policy in place that says for refunds you will only return the amount of Bitcoin used in the purchase, and not the USD equivalent. Also keep in mind that it goes both ways, I mean, if the price goes down and you're returning the USD amount you're effectively giving them less money, but if you're returning the BTC amount then the worth of those coins is more than they originally purchased for.
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:02:38

@_date: 2013-12-15 23:15:07
Thanks. Can you give a technical walkthrough of how it works as far as the programming aspects are concerned? Do you have custom APIs for every site? Do you have custom APIs for specific sites, and a 'generic' API for the ones that aren't covered? Do you scrape the page for form data and use that? Etc. I think the idea is great and the implementation looks smooth from what I can tell by the video, but I'd like to make sure I don't see any holes before I'd be comfortable using the service.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:48:51

No it doesn't. Shares aren't currencies, they're speculative assets. The same as Bitcoin would be in a country where it's not classed as a 'legal currency'. i.e. every single country in the world at the moment... Just because it's not a 'legal currency' doesn't mean it can't be traded for goods either, otherwise it would be illegal for me to trade my hat for your shirt should you deem it a fair trade. This whole legal currency circlejerk thing is just confusing people.

Bitcoin is 95% speculation, Litecoin is 99% speculation. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:23:06
This is stupid as hell. You're basically like "hey guys, I'm worried that Litecoin may be impacting my Bitcoin returns", so you list out a bunch of ways for encouraging the growth of the Bitcoin price.
I hold both coins, and I think this whole 'Litecoin is a threat' thing is really immature. It's been said countless times before, they operate in unison. You're just another person looking to protect your own interests by spewing fear. This circle jerk is starting to get really old. I hope the newbies can see straight through you.

Oh god yes. I'd use this, presuming the Fiat never touches anything I own, or is identifiable to me. In other words, presuming the USD doesn't go into my bank accounts or anything. Otherwise we'll have to pay ridiculous amounts of tax on every purchase we make with the card, and it'll all be traced by the banking institutes, and for purchases over $10,000 they'll be reported to the 'fraud' related departments automatically. If you can get around this and keep it anonymous from the banks and governments perspective would be the only way this can succeed. So yeah, please give priority to this aspect, it's an important one.
