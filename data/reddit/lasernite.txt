Ah you're right! I was thinking exponential, but that would be continuous, so I guess poisson is the discrete version of an exponential distribution. Thanks :)

Sorry, should've backed this up with some numbers sooner. To keep this simpler, take the five blocks just up to the fork at block 478558. During the preceding period of ten minutes up to the fork, five blocks were mined, blocks 478554-478558. The independent probability of 5 events occurring in the period during which one event normally occurs is e^-1 /5! by a poisson distribution, or approximately 0.31% or &lt; 1/300. The probability of 5+ events occurring is about, 0.37% or &lt; 1/270.

Not sure anyone actually cares, but I was happy to find a resolution, so thought I would share. From  earlier
You can see in the top graph, the seconds between blocks around the split don't look any more abnormal than anywhere else today. But the variance looked unusual to me, so I generated the lower graph which buckets number of blocks today by number of minutes between, and you can clearly see that the distribution is not normal around ten minutes (600 seconds), but is instead exponential. This explains why you could see lots of blocks below ten minutes with higher probability than I had suspected, as although the mean is around 10 minutes, it's due to the long tail, with the mode being more like 3 minutes.

Looking for entries at $4k in nine months? :P

Also getting the same thing, did you find any resolution?
