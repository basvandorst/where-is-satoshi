Studied in Botswana back in the day. Absolutely love that nation. However, be careful bc even though it's much more developed and progressive than almost all African countries it's still run on a system where money talks.

I thought this was a joke bc MGMT has a song called thank you... Or, wait, is it called congratulations. Nvm. This is funny, though.

Hmm, that's a very interesting statistic. I think there are people in the rural area that are struggling but nowhere near other parts of Africa. HIV/AIDS is a huge problem and it's the too nation in the world for the STD. Botswana has done an AMAZING job redistributing the wealth of the diamond trade there. Everyone at the uni I was at was not only receiving free tuition, board, etc but also a monthly allowance - I paid to attend and use their facilities for the year I was there... However, I didn't pay what I should have bc I just bribed a few people here and there. It's extremely disorganized compared to western standards but they're trying in the sense, but nepotism is a HUGE problem. Work and time do not take priority. It's definitely a "I'll get to it" type of culture. Nothing wrong with that... Tbh, I wish the whole world would just take a breath and realize money isn't everything for the soul of the human... However, it's a huge pain like I said to get any work done if you actually want something done.

In your opinion, when do you think we will see this "bubble" pop or "come down rapidly"?

We're just curious what others think. I use to work for an investment firm and before any major decisions were made an associate would always veer over to ask another investor what they think. Why should those who buy bitcoins be any different?

How? I can't figure out how to buy bitcoins! It's a roller coaster even being able to buy...

Thank you!

Now you're a neutral creative man!

What's that? Serious question - I'm new here.

You're about to make me a very rich/poor man.
