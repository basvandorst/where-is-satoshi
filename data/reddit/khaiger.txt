Look at what Jihan just did in the past couple of days.
Jihan's the master of BTC price manipulation.
Do you honestly think it's coincidence that BTC price tanked to &lt;1900, then began bouncing up when Bitmain's tweet to signal Segwit2x came out?

Yes there is a lot of core bashing in China atm. They are siding with miners. I was merely pointing out lack of awareness of such circumstances on the part of the author.

The author doesn't really have a deep understanding of the circumstances surrounding the drama and the possible ramifications the current predicament. The author doesn't seem to be aware of the face that SegWit2x is pushed by miners and that the Core is against it. Plus, he doesn't understand the lengths that Jihan Ver would go in their attempts to profit from this (I presume they're holding large amount of LTC at the moment and could even attempt to purposefully drop the value of BTC to buy them back cheap; this has been Jihad's motive behind the past 2 deliberate BTC dumps). All in all, the author can't distinguish between the different scaling options and isn't aware of the financial motives of the miners, not to mention the political/ideological tension between the two camps (miners vs. users &amp; core). Ignorance is bliss.

it was good. thanks for the video.
my 2 cents are just keep the music volume down so we can actually hear what he's saying.
