That's too bad for you, then. "ethics" is the closest thing to a legitimate purpose that GG even has, even if it is fundamentally misguided.

Right, hence all the GJP e-mails that have come to light where games journalists discuss writing "gamers are dead" articles together.
Oh shit, _that never happened_. And a large number of those "gamers are dead" articles (most of which didn't actually say that gamers are dead, but GG doesn't care) were written by people _not even on GJPs in the first place_.
People saw the Leigh Alexander post and Dan Golding's Tumblr and decided that they wanted to have similar content on their own sites. There's your conspiracy.

You _should_ talk to me. You might learn something.

Whoa! Thanks for the gold!

I don't think I've said anything to you about "harassment" or "misogyny". 
What I have pointed out to you is your utterly broken understanding of the ethical concerns of games journalism.

You _must_ be joking. What corrupting influence are you proclaiming that Mattie Brice has here? The corrupting power of making a joke?

No, dumbo, they're not a source of most of the corruption. That's why nobody in the business treats GG seriously. Because that claim is just so fucking stupid.The source of the corruption in the gaming media is the AAA dev studios and the publishers they work with. They're the ones who decide who gets copies of games to review, they're the ones who spend advertised dollars, they're the ones who have been proven, *by games journalists*, to have an extreme and undesirable influence over games journalism.SJWs? That you suggest that shows how desperately little you know about the games media.
