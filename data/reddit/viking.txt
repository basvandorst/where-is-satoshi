How does the length of futures get agreed upon? Both sides come to an agreement to any length of days? Can it be as short as a day? Hours?

So, monthly trading terminations? Seems all these people expecting a crash on Monday are overreacting.
Then again, I'm really not familiar with futures at all..

The entire chain is just under 160GB as of today. You'll want to go bigger than that to leave room for it to grow. I used a spare 320GB. Also, you may want to download the chain via torrent on a different computer as it can take a looong time with a Pi.

[MrChrisJ's guide on Github]( was a fantastic resource to get a Raspberry Pi running a full Bitcoin Core full node. It will be command line only (no GUI) so you'll have to be fairly familiar with SSH and Linux commands. I used the latest Raspbian image (2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch.img) You can pretty much follow it line by line. Just replace any command that says version 0.13.2 with 0.15.0.1
For example, 
    git clone -b v0.13.2 
    git clone -b v0.15.0.1 
You'll need:
* A Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
* A large external drive
* MicroUSB power cable/wall outlet
* Network cable if not on Wifi
* Patience while running the "make" commands and while the node downloads the blockchain
While you do need to connect the Pi to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to do the initial setup, the Raspberry Pi will be headless. This means it will only need a network cable (if not on wifi) and power cable once it's all setup - it does not need a dedicated monitor, keyboard, and mouse. You will SSH into the device to check the status.

I've never tried it, but Powershell can now run BASH (common Linux command line). Not sure how that script would run.

No one knows what it will do after the fork - that's the nature of Bitcoin.

That might have the answer you are looking for. Are you worried about your ISP seeing your transactions? I don't think you need to be worrying about this.

Look into Electrum. Have you already ordered your hardware wallet? If so, wait for that.

Coinbase/GDAX hit a high of $6149.75.

There is no exact date. It's whenever block  494,784 hits.

Well that's not true at all. The whole point of a VPN is encrypting your traffic between locations.

Do the reccuring buys have the same fees as a one-time buy on Coinbase?
