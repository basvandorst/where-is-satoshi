Hello! Raising capital, capital markets, is typically a very regulated environment. For example, in the United States, if you wish to list your company on a stock exchange and/or offer a private offering, the company will need to hire rather expensive investment bankers (with their attorneys) to create proper paper work. Nevertheless, we probably need to do some legal research, before we go that route. This is all new for us and we want to make sure we don't break any laws and do everything in a legal way.
