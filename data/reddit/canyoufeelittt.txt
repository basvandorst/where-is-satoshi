I think Bitcoin can be "successful" in the same way that gold and checks and money orders are "successfully" being used in society. It might not be an all-encompassing thing but it will be very important in the future for some (or a majority, even) of commerce. It has some very effective use cases.
The thing is, bad money drives out good. In the beginning, ancient Athens used to mint very high-quality gold coins, but as they progressed and went into wars they debased their currencies. The new copper-minted coins were seen as inferior to the earlier coins so eventually the earlier coins became worth multiples of the most recent coins.
People valued the earlier coins more, and saved them (took them out of circulation) so eventually the bad money (copper coins) drove out the good money (gold coins)
Bitcoin is perfect money. Which leads me to believe people will value it, but will not use it for everyday transactions

A finite supply is not necessarily bad either. It all depends on what type of situation you are in. Inflation can work in some circumstances. Deflation can work in some circumstances.
A finite supply does not necessarily restrict economic growth. The concept of a "deflationary spiral" is just that. It is a concept. There has been no evidence of a destructive deflationary spiral ever occurring in history.

You seem pretty misguided, actually. You have to understand that most of modern-day economic theory is simply the study of central banking. Economics is not a science, it has not been around nearly long enough for anyone to know everything... Central banks have only been around for a couple hundred years!
Do you really think simply deflating the monetary supply is going to end the world? Lol! Yeah because people are going not buy food and starve because "zomg! It will be worth more next year!" No. The market has a way of balancing things out...
The fact is that the notion of continuous inflation of the money supply being "good for the economy" relies on many assumptions: 1. Continuous population growth, 2. Every person being born contributing positively to the economy (people can contribute negatively, like prisoners who live on tax money, for instance), and 3. The government spending the extra inflated money wisely. It is pretty clear that  and  are not always correct.
Inflation steals from the people who currently holding currency and rewards the people inflating the money supply (the people who get to use the "new money"). Not only is this morally questionable, the impact can also be unclear when considering that there are different methods of applying inflation. For instance, what do you think about a currency that has a 2% inflation every year, but EVERYBODY (not just the banks like in our current system) gets the new money? By that, I mean we have 2% inflation of the money supply, but the new money goes to EVERYBODY, i.e. everybody's money/bank account increases by 2% every year. (I know this is not actually possible in real life, but consider it a thought experiement.) Since everybody's buying power remains the same (because each individual's slice of the pie remains the same), would this have the same effects as a fixed money supply?

Of course it is. It is a direct consequence of inflationary money (referring to fiat inflation, AKA money printing). Explain to me how during **every period of fiat inflation in history**, income inequality rose? And during **every period of fiat deflation in history**, income inequality shrank?
Fiat inflation is **the most trickle-down policy** ever created. Trickle-down economics doesn't work and this has been proven time and time again.
The problem with fiat inflation is, who gets the new money? The Fed creates it, then ships it off to 3 sectors: Wall St, the military industrial complex, and federal programs. Every dollar you have in your pocket comes from one of those 3 places. People contracting or working in these areas (generally privileged, rich people) get to use the money before it's filtered through the economy and prices have risen. In the case of Wall St (where the vast majority of the new money goes), most of the money doesn't even make it to Main St and stays in the banks forever, inflating stock/asset prices and making the rich even more rich.
Inflation ends up being redistribution of wealth from the poor/middle-class to the rich via taxes

You may want to brush up on your facts. In the case of QE which now accounts for the vast majority of the monetary base, this is exactly how it happened.


Would the demand for US Treasuries be what it is without the Fed in the market as the largest buyer? Absolutely not!


Nothing, except for having Moby Dick pump up their bonds and stocks and assets to never-seen-before highs!


This is not the real problem. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Give the Fed the power to create money unhindered, and of course they will create more than necessary! The long-term solution is to take this power away from the Fed.
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:38:58


**How is this actually being done though?** Currently, by simply giving the new money to the banks (mostly). What you said would be fair if **everyone** got their fair share of the new money. But instead, only the banks get it.
It's illegal for you and me to counterfeit money. It's not illegal for the banks to do it, however.

If you are a federally recognized bank, a more accurate description would be, “Sure, most vendors won’t trust a receipt from me, but they have a gun held to their head so they have to. Meanwhile nobody else can print receipts except me! I have all the guns! I get all the free money!”
“Furthermore, if the receipts don’t get paid back, we’ll just do a bailout or tax all Americans a little more to make up the difference! There’s literally no way I can lose!”

It's not only unenforceable, it's unjust.
During a chain split no income is  actually created or realized because both chains share the same miners,  same users, same ecosystem. A chain split is exactly analogous to a  company splitting in two, with no change in ownership (which current tax  laws treat as no income gained or realized).
Furthermore chain splits actually result in losses, because two smaller networks  are not as valuable as one big network (Metcalfe's law).
There  was only one chain split EVER where the value of both chains rose after  the split and that was Bitcoin Cash... now the IRS is treating that as  canonical whereas it's actually an extreme exception (beginning of a  bubble)

Monetary inflation always leads to
a) inflation in goods/services (CPI)
b) inflation in assets (investing)
QE may not have affected a much, but it did affect b

No, it encourages investing in shit/inefficient companies which then blow up causing even more loss to the economy.
Whereas without inflation, shit companies don't get started because there's no artificial incentive to invest in them.

\&gt; Deflation is a problem in a debt based economy as the price of the debt increases.
Not true. When charging interest, lenders take inflation/deflation into account which zeros any advantages.
@_date: 2019-02-17 16:54:20
Also, the components/ratios in the CPI are a joke. If using past definitions of CPI, the actual inflation rate of goods/services is 9% or higher ([shadowstats.com](
An increase in the money supply always leads to inflation of everything that is not money. Which piece of the pie will be affected more than others is anybody's guess (usually pre-determined by govt cronies), but the whole pie always inflates.

\&gt; Inflation is necessary. When money is hoarded by the masses, the economy can collapse.
Wrong. GDP is a totally flawed measure that doesn't account for levels of happiness, leisure, freedom (China has a high GDP)
Most devastatingly, GDP does not account for the destruction of our environment.
Under 0% inflation, people will still buy food, necessary goods. Technology is inflationary (TVs get cheaper every year), this doesn't stop people from buying TVs.
All inflation does, is encourage investing in shit/inefficient companies which then blow up causing even more loss to the economy. Whereas without inflation, shit companies don't get started because there's no artificial incentive to invest in them.
Under 0% inflation, we'd have a more environmentally sustainable, happier, non-warring, non-consumeristic world. People would work 8 hour weeks (and would be doing this now, were it not for the banks inflating and stealing the rewards from all our productivity gains.)

Very nicely put. I do believe that even if the government budget were balanced, the timeliness is that the government still needs to borrow. i.e. borrow the budget at the beginning of the year, pay at end with interest

QE is an unfair, disastrous, totally trickle-down method of introducing money to the economy. The ECB buys government bonds with newly created QE money thus benefiting ONLY bond-holders (which are banks). The banks get to use the new money first before it trickles down to the rest of the economy and prices have inflated (Cantillon effect).
A truly fair method, would be to just deposit the QE money into every citizen's personal bank account. This way everybody gets to use the new money first (essentially some form of UBI).
But an even bigger problem than QE, and one that's entrenched in all modern finance systems today, is the creation of money as debt. What the government should do instead is just print money debt-free like Lincoln did with greenbacks, rather than borrow the money from the Fed (a pure middleman) who fleeces all the taxpayers with interest. Simply put, just print money without involving debt: the "default intuitive" method.
Eliminating debt from money printing means no banks benefit from it. It's simple, and the default position. You really have to wonder who started the "money as debt" delusion a long time ago and got other fellow exploiters to buy into it so thoroughly that any other kind of system nowadays is unthinkable (at least in mainstream economics). These guys were diabolical geniuses.
This is why the existence of treasury bonds only benefit the banks. Because the government doesn't need to issue bonds to get funding, it can just print money like Lincoln did in the Civil War with greenbacks. Instead, we have a roundabout system where the government issues bonds, the Fed/banks create money to buy these bonds, then the taxpayer pays interest perpetually to the banks.

No. The OP did not clearly think this through.
Firstly, definitions.
Monetary inflation = increase in the money supply. Monetary inflation ALWAYS leads to the below:
1. Inflation in price of goods/services (CPI. What most people mean by "inflation")
2. Inflation in assets (investing)
It could be one, the other, or both. This is because the newly created money always has to go somewhere.
The current implementation of inflation is not fair. Because the Fed/banks print the money so they get to use it first before it's filtered through the economy and prices have inflated (Cantillon effect). If you or I tried to print money, it'd be called counterfeiting.
So, think about the absurdity of what the OP is saying. For the economy to be "healthy," a THIEF (the Fed) needs to STEAL 2% of money from everybody every year and give it to themselves???
That said, there IS a fair way to inflate. The fair way, is to just give everybody their fair share of the new money. Just deposit the new money in everybody's bank accounts (basically some form of UBI). But then, mathematically, we'd be back to where we started- if everybody's % share of the money supply remained exactly the same, it has the same effect as 0% inflation.

I believe confidential transactions should be the  priority followed by LN for scaling because fees are getting too high and crowding out many possible uses of the blockchain. Confidential transactions seem like they will enable many ordinary users and gamblers and bitcoin porn site customers to use freely and not worry about Coinbase/Circle digging into the finer details of their usage.
The holy grail would be features that will enable a noob who got their coins off Coinbase to send to a gambling site in 1 hop without Coinbase knowing. I understand this might be hard but anything that brings us closer to that in terms of easy user experience would be help.
