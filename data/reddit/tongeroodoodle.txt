I got in late and only have 225 coins right now.  I think once wallstreet gets in, we're in for a wild ride.  As crazy as it sounds, 1 million in 2018 is not out of question.

would be a good idea.  Your 401k will average 8% per year?  Take the penalty and grow it for real.

im not joking.

yea, just not much you can do with 1.5 million.  Getting to 3 or 5 million is a really big deal.  At 1.5 million you can still live nice and be set for life, but with 3-5 you get more leverage and have some entry into private investing and business deals.  I just want to use my wealth to leverage business.  I don't really care about possessions or having ego-related bullshit.

yea if i would have bought in just at the beginning of this yea, would have 1000 coins.  It's hard to get over.  I think I would be pretty happy if I could cash out 3.5M and maybe keep 200 coins or so.  As it is right now, I stand to lose everything, but only got 225 coins.  o well that's life

TFW I PUT MY LIFE SAVINGS INTO BITCOIN @ 2200 AND HOUSTON IS IN THE WORLD SERIES :D :D

225 coins is only 1.5 million.  If I didn't have my head up my ass the past 7 years, I would be an extremely rich man right now.  It hurts to accept, but I'm here now.  I have to sit around and watch these other bitcoin billionaires wave it in my face.

you mean when.

wallstreet doesn't play games.  This has been a market by amateurs for amateurs.  The traders are about to get their shit pushed in by the pros and the people who didn't buy in are sure going to regret it when we reach 1M/coin soon  
  
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:26:29
no, you don't understand.  We will likely see bitcoin go to over 10 million for one coin.  I would bet at least 30 million, but probably more.

wall street crash will boost bitcoin, as it will gold
