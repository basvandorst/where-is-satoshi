Nice, some schmuck pays 16.95 for mBTC, only to pay 16.95 to transfer it to his wallet smh

My gf knows that I'm invested in btc, but I'm pretty sure she has zero fucks to give regarding it.  I know she has no interest in the technology part of it and she seems oblivious to the fact that the price has tripled in the last 4 months.  The last thing I want is for her to see my account and get the idea to cash it out to start spending it on trips and shit.

I agree with this.  The current scenario is a trader's wet dream.  Two assets that perform the same function at two giant price discrepancies.  Expect prices to see-saw at least until the end of the year.

Agreed.  But we'll still get posts complaining about how they missed out once btc rebounds

It's not sustainable if you are serious about combating global warming.  I would say going forward, this along with the scaling debate are the biggest obstacles Bitcoin is going to have to confront.  It's also funny to see this exist for 11 hours and have 6 posts while the 100th post about 7000 has over a hundred comments

My understanding from the comments in their github was that BCC never implemented Segwit, so the Replay Protection code couldn't be integrated easily.

The timing is bizarre though.  At least wait until after the fork to market your shitcoin.  Garzik just made everyone who signed the NYA look like pawns in his scheme.
