Fasho the answer is no, bro

LN.. let's build a network to sidestep the transactional design because a bunch of institutional money wants to cripple and control the asset. Block size goes up, no mo problems ��

Or maybe you could understand that the LN *literally* makes bitcoin operate like existing institutional transaction networks that don't actually move funds. There are plenty of scaling options and tech illustrated by other coins and tokens to fix bitcoin's problem. Increasing block size is a fundamental part of that solution.  And based on the other parts of your fact-less rebuttal, I'd say you're a LN troll ��

And that's why it's soooooooooo awesome. Creating a network to work beside another network with a scaling problem.. that could've been fixed, if it had scaled... 
but wait! A version of the blockchain did, and it's called Bitcoin Cash.. and it's proven to be more efficient, lower transaction fees, and doesn't need an entire network (regardless of whether smart people made it) to make it feasible as a currency. If you understood anything about banking you'd realize the LN is basically the traditional financial model glued on top of Bitcoin. 
This absolutely ruins its purpose. That's why it's garbage and why anyone that defends it has no f'n argument in my book.  Institutions have paid good money to try and ruin any competition. The situation with bitcoin and the lightning network is a prime example of rich people paying smart people to cripple a technology that threatens their profits. ��

Nope, not gonna happen, and it all you're doing is spreading crap ��
I hope you get hit by a prison bus full of convicted goat rapists.. and subsequently maimed into the shape of a goat.. and subsequently left in their custody like a ward of the state.. and subsequently violated for the next 40-50 years.. in the bum

I bet you do.. at this point this stuff is just hilarious. Amazing that bitcoin struggles to break 9k and Bitcoin cash is over $1375 and climbing. It has 50% more relative value against BTC than it did during the December boom. LN is a bunch of crap created by shills.
