Especially because time is of the essence if you want to maximize your mining capability.   Having a 10GH/s rig now means a lot more than having a 10GH/s rig a year from now. 
When I'm computing cost per GH I'm going to look at what I can get right now on eBay or Craigslist, not promises from a manufacturer.  I can't mine with promises.  I've found that there's not much difference in cost per GH whether you get a ton of erupters or you buy an in-hand high end piece of gear.  You're going to pay roughly the same amount per GH no matter what you do.  (between $150 and $200).  The premium for high end gear is more aimed towards lessened power consumption and infrastructure ease of use (easier to manage one server blade than 200 USB erupters) rather than extra GH per dollar spent.

An erupter costs me $0.006 per day tops (at $0.05 kw/h, admittedly far below the average) to run.  It yields me about a hundred times its cost to run daily.  Difficulty would need to increase a LOT, even at its recent 20% spikes, before I'd need to consider shutting it down.  Yes, its yield will decrease at time goes on, but I think difficulty will reach some sort of equilibrium or at least slow significantly before it gets to that point.

USB asic miner prices are plummeting as well, not a month ago they were $100.  Price got dropped to .6BTC a few weeks ago and I heard something about them going down to .35..  this morning they were $65 shipped/BIN on ebay, now they are $55.
You used to pay $300 or more per in-hand ghash/sec, now you'll be able to get the same for like $100.  Cheaper processing means difficulty will continue to explode.  I feel really bad for anyone sitting in a BFL queue right now - by the time they get the gear it's not going to be worth the price they paid.

Bits.. bitcoin.. I see what they did there

I don't think difficulty will go DOWN but I think the recent difficulty increases are unsustainable - ASICs are only now becoming readily available to the general public and as it has created such a massive gap between electricity cost and BTC return compared to what we had with GPU mining, the market is really just undergoing a correction.  Once the 'gold rush' ends the curve should likely flatten. 
Also keep in mind that the cycle we are about to enter is the first one where electricity costs will finally outstrip return from GPU mining and we will see all remaining GPU miners leave the market over the next few weeks.
I think as the return on mining lowers it will converge on the average cost of electricity WRT ASICs (which will force people out of the market if they live in areas like New England or California which have much more expensive power on average.)  The future of mining will probably involve returns of a mere few cents daily per gh/s after electricity costs.

Better to spend $300 on 1.5 gh/s that you can have now than $300 on 5gh/s that you'll get a year from now.
The erupters will have paid for themselves in that year (or as close as they'll ever get to doing so) whereas when you finally get that BFL rig difficulty will be so high at its current increasing rate that you won't even come close to recouping the investment.
Aside from electricity costs, opportunity cost is the next most important consideration as to whether to take up mining.

Right now there's a big enough gap between difficulty and income such that it's still even mildly profitable to GPU farm - not to buy GPUs to farm with, mind you, but if you found one on the street and took it home to farm with the income would still outpace the electric cost.
This window is fast closing, though and I see the big difficulty changes as a sort of market correction because there really is that huge gap between the average power cost and what an ASIC chip can make per day.  In the coming months I see farming becoming more cutthroat and the winners will not have the highest hash counts per se but the cheapest power.

I get the feeling that it would be incredibly easy to throw up a mockup of a site promising the next wave in bitcoin mining, set up pre orders, take the money, and run.

Where did you get the BFL equipment from?   
I really want some, but everything I hear is that BFL is taking eons to ship their machines out and looking at Ebay even the 5gh/s Jalapenos are going for $1k as opposed to the $300 from the main site.   USB ASIC miners are also dropping to .6 BTC tomorrow (supposedly) and I have a guy that will sell them for $50 a pop if I buy in bulk and pay in cash.  At least for now, I'm getting a far better deal in terms of $/GH by just stacking ASIC erupters rather than paying the grossly inflated fees for BFL off of eBay or ordering through the site and missing out on months of mining time.
I suppose there's still the threat of BFL gear getting more readily available and making my USB rigs obsolete but since I pay so little for electricity (free at work office, less than .05/kwh at home) I'm not too worried about the erupters getting outpaced before I make my investment back.

I thought it did.  Fail the pass entry too many times and it says "you are doing that too much.  Try again in X seconds" - at least in the UI.

Maybe that's the best use of our block erupters.. save money on heating costs in the winter
