Bitcoin makes life worth living, a new meaning to money.

As well as expensive cars.

I meant no fees from the bank once I exchanged sterling to DKK and the bank charged me £9.50 just for the transaction. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:18:38
They make tractors as well.
@_date: 2018-09-29 20:13:54
I thought the idea was to get rid of the banks not make more of them
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:25:48
I have a euro currency account to buy bitcoin using the SEPA transfer method. No fees except the exchange rate! It’s great.

I wonder what to get for mothers day, Maybe some bitcoin.

So do I.
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:37:19
Or spend on food and water and expand the currency then take over the euro sterling and the dollar. And bankrupt the banks I probably won’t be alive when it happens but i wish I was.

I was about to ask this
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:51:51
I found out when I was 17 at college I was studying Media and my friend was studying I.T. think just learnt about the dark web and the deep web told me to download Tor browser so surprisingly on the college computers i did it (their firewall sucks dick).
Found the link for Silk Road before it was seized by the US government think it was Silk Road 2.0 that’s how we found out what bitcoin was thought it was something weird with all the decimals so there I was just browsing through the pages pf drugs and illicit activities 0.02 for some meth 89% pure. Really wish i got in bitcoin and crypto sooner.
Won’t tell me how much scared of the IRS even though we don’t have them in our country.

@_date: 2018-07-29 16:06:16

@_date: 2018-04-16 12:58:29
Bitcoin should be at the top

And when the bitcoin account is promoting how to use bcash in a video virtually the same as the bitcoin v2 video.

I fucking love Switzerland! Better privacy, better banks, better gun control. It's clean you can go skiing in winter and mountain biking in summer. The only downside is everything is expensive, but everything has a price.
