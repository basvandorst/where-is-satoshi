I come to this sub just to see how divorced from reality the posts can become.

I see...


This is exactly what I'm talking about. You're unwilling to even consider the possibility that there are people who understand Bitcoin, have philosophies on investing that to not align with it, and have chosen not to participate. When low intelligence is the default criticism for anyone that disagrees it makes this place sound like @_date: 2014-03-31 18:39:59
Just to clarify: are you familiar with Buffet's investing philosophy? If so, you should understand why he's not interested in speculative assets like gold and bitcoin.
Cherry picking gold as an asset with remarkable gains over the last decade--a decade that, as you said yourself, saw extremely unusual economic conditions--is *not* a reliable indicator of Buffet's investing prowess. His entire career shits all over your point that he's not a good investor.
If we were in any other sub besides this feedback loop, others would be chiming in on your gold-since-2001 timeframe.

Here's some reading that sort of makes my point: 
Key passage:


There *are* very smart people who are not interested in Bitcoin, as foreign as that seems to you.

That's *the worst* cherry-picked time frame to examine gold through.
You have to understand that Buffet doesn't like speculative assets, period. Gold, by definition, is speculative. (Bitcoin is as well.) It's not a dirty word or anything, but that's not the kind of investor he is.
So, two points:
1. On a longer, more appropriate timeframe, gold is a very poor performing investment. This is fact, not opinion.
2. Noting how much gold has beaten Berkshire is not an appropriate measure of how good or bad an investor Buffet is.

You pay no attention to anyone who disagrees with you. Thank you for proving you have zero perspective.


Take an honest look around this sub, and tell me you don't see any cognitive dissonance. I'm not anti-Bitcoin by any stretch, but it's quite clear you are wearing Bitcoin colored glasses.
Are you saying the world is divided into people who have invested in Bitcoin and dumb people?

I used it asking a rhetorical question, representing your views. You answered by saying, yes, anyone who hasn't invested is dumb. One of us is saying all people of who disagree with me are unintelligent. And it ain't me.
