Is there some sort of list of rudimentary things one needs to understand in order to fully understand how bitcoin works? 
My problem is this: I want to memorize and fully understand how bitcoin works. I can choose from many topics, but if I start at UTXO, or ECDSA, I might get a bit confused and not know the best route backwards to fill in the gaps. 
So, assuming someone has a basic college level understanding of mathematics (calc, algebra etc). What's a good place to start? Understanding what hashing is? Then what next? 
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:22:19
Whenever bitcoin picks up popularity, there always seems to be a lot of these 'found my old wallet' posts, and here's a pic of my wallet when I bought bitcoin for $10 posts. I think there is an entity out there that believes these posts have a psychological effect on new investors, in that the entity believes (or has been led to believe) that it discourages new investors. I think that if this is true, that it's really cute and adorable that that this entity is trying so hard, thinking they're sly, when really it's super opaque and cringe, and they should probably hire a new psych lead.

TBH I don't really quite totally understand what fungible means, I couldn't explain it to a five year old. My loose understanding is that fungible basically means that whatever fungible item you have can be divided into smaller pieces, and those pieces can be interchanged without a bunch of resistance....am I getting this right?

Oh cool what a great example, thank you for taking the time to write this out. It happens to be an example I really get because I know a bit about crude (WTI vs other types and why they differ in price per barrel). 
I have a bit of a learning disability so these sort of examples really help me out, I appreciate it very much, cheers. 
So to test my understanding, elements are fungible right? Because you can't really distinguish 1 gram of gold from some shady deal, from 1 gram of gold that grandpa has in a coffee jar, because the atoms in gold can't be individually traced (unless you're god or something).
Edit: oh one more thing, is divisibility a component of fungibility, or is divisibility its own thing? On a side note I'm trying to figure out if fungibility is on a spectrum, or if it's black and white.
@_date: 2019-07-25 06:08:37
Ya, because it was all bullshit. Color me surprised.
@_date: 2019-07-08 00:18:34
Oh ok, I see. Is fungibility on a spectrum, like, something can be somewhat fungible, or just a little bit fungible? Or is it binary, A funguble, B not fungible?
Also, suppose prejudice were applied in some areas of the world and not in others, would atomic swapping to something more fungible like monero or the mimble wimble family of coins be a way of sidestepping that fungibility issue? So suppose india blacklists specific coins with some 'shady history', could someone just atomic swap for grin, and then atomic swap grin for ₿ with a person in a more liberty friendly country for clean coins?
Edit: This makes me think that newly minted or long time dormant bitcoins might be more valuable for a period of time, if prejudice is applied in some countries, and not in others. Thank you for your time.

No I just need to fill some gaps in my brain. I've been into bitcoin for a while, and have a pretty good understanding of things, but sometimes people ask me basic questions that I don't have the fundamental understanding to answer so that *they* really understand. I want to be able to give the answers that a good teacher would give.

@_date: 2019-07-07 23:34:42
Oh ok so it's an if/then thing. So if prejudice is applied then it becomes less fungible, but for now still fungible. Got it.

You aren't really making a good argument that they aren't accepting bitcoin. You'd just rather see companies not use 3rd party payment processors for bitcoin. I get that. 
Bitcoin doesn't require pretty GUI mobile wallets either, it's all about convenience. Some people enjoy the convenience of the 3rd party payment processors, because they make it easier for non technical business owners to accept bitcoin.

Could old US military payment certificates be analogous to tokens issued on blockchain's liquid? Like, USD is base layer (liquid), and the MPC is a sort of token that the Military issued? 
and I do mean loosely analogous. Very loosely, because I know that if I issue my own grouchy bonds on liquid, that there's no legal obligation (currently no legal obligation).

You can't see the private keys on coinbase. If you use the send feature, you can send it out of coinbase, to another public address. Sort of like sending an email from gmail to your icloud inbox, except when you send the email, the email is permanently deleted from the gmail inbox. That's because bitcoins have scarcity, and emails do not. 
It's good you're afraid. Always be afraid when it comes to bitcoin. That's the best policy for us non technical types. I think even software engineers would agree, from a disaster mitigation perspective, that a non technical person should maximize their fear when it comes to bitcoin security. Max fear, should lead to max security, or at least, max fear will lead to a higher probability of not losing any funds. 
That being said, there are some cheap hardware wallets out there, but there are downsides to the cheap ones. 
You could use an open dime. I think they're like $30 if you just buy one. I pulled that number out of my ass. The downside there is that if you lose the open dime, you lose the private keys, you lose your money. 
Being your own bank is hard, but the benefit to all that trouble, is that you get to be your own bank.

Just kinda seems like a publicity stunt to get advertisement on the r/bitcoin front page. 
This always happens when there's a surge in new subscribers in r/bitcoin. I usually report these opaque attempts at sly advertising, but I figure the mods want this out in the open for some reason, and I trust their judgement. 
For roger and his cronies, I guess any publicity is good publicity. There are plenty of people who will be totally convinced by the lies in r/btc. His buy-in cost for all the BCH he holds is $0. He literally printed them out himself, cloned his own massive bitcoin holdings, so anything he can get for them &gt;$0 is a win in his book. 
At this point I'm pretty tired of fighting them. They're really good at selling this scam to people, so good for them, at least Roger is actually good at something, I'm happy he found his true calling. What a dipshit. lol

I think the do 'do you accept bitcoin' thing is a little annoying. It's annoying to me because you're kinda sidestepping what you really want to ask. 
The way I phrased it was 'you ever consider accepting bitcoin?' and they'd either say yes and we'd have a chat, or they'd say 'Bitcoin what's that?' and I either go with 'don't worry about it' or 'digital money, google it, bye' and leave it at that.

The problem I'm having is people knowing that I was into bitcoin in 2013. "Oh you bought it in 2013 you must be loaded" "well...no actually, I'm still just making it by..." People don't really get math. Even though I knew about it in 2013 I'd still have to have had tens of thousands of dollars (fucking around money) to throw at pre-mt gox bitcoin in order to have made enough to retire early. I did not have that sort of change to be risking on things like bitcoin. But anyway, that's my story.

Well if the rate of new money entering the market is equal to the rate of new coins produced you would have stasis in terms of price. If the demand exceeds the rate of supply the price goes up. 
It's an interesting concept, where a maximum rate is a new type of hard coded limit. Bitcoin has max velocity, this other coin has max acceleration. 
Edit: sorry for being a dick at first, got you confused with someone else.
Edit 2: I had the exact same initial reaction upon seeing the emission rate, but thought about it some more, and realized that new coins as a % of total in circulation constantly goes down over time, so the new coins matter less and less when compared to the whole, over time. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:32:21
So many people were interested in grin when it launched, there will be no 'satoshi's coin stash', which is nice IMO. I don't really care about satoshi's coins TBH, but it's worth mentioning there is no founder with a huge huge stake mined early.

A lot of them, not quite all of them. There are still other ways to market a coin to having advantages to bitcoin. 
Anonymity is one thing, data footprint is another. I'm hoping that there is a block size reduction once the LN is fully established and kicking major ass. 
Edit: Do you realize that the focus of marketing could shift entirely to data footprint in the blink of an eye? All it would take is some sort of issue with one of the other coins that happens to have a gigantic fucking data footprint (because hey hostless hordable digital cats are the future) where there is a loss of user funds due to something having to do with that data footprint.

@_date: 2019-02-28 03:26:03
No it's the most brilliant thing since bitcoin. In fact, I think bitcoin had to exist first, before a maximum rate could be considered like a max cap. It's a new concept, but if you think about it, a fixed rate beats the arbitrary rates of central banks any day of the week. 
So, think about it, if you start to see the brilliance in it before others, you can capitalize on that. So do your homework, and try to think of the steady drip of 1 grin / sec not as infinite inflation, but rather, a new concept of time-money.
Also, consider that with a fixed block reward for eternity, you get pow for eternity, pow works as we've seen for 9 years of bitcoin history. Also, the new coins as a % of total is always in decline. I don't know if you ever took calculus, bit imagine bitcoin but instead of reaching 21 million, it approached infinity, or like if the halving schedule continued on and on. 
Edit: A fixed eternal supply rate seems odd to those in favor of sound money, but what makes money un sound? It's that it's printing is arbitrary, subject to the whims of a few people, unelected people. Velocity of money is a good thing, and this carries the velocity of sound money for eternity.

I think the fact that its still around, is just a testament to people feeling like there aren't enough bitcoin to go around. Which may or may not be true, I don't know. I guess it depends on how much fake fiat there is in the world, but if the price gets over a dollar a satoshi, it's going to become an issue. That's why I'm starting to embrace certain alts, that, at a minimum act in symbiosis with bitcoin if not flat out supplement it in a fully bitcoinized world. There are some really interesting projects involving mimble wimble that I like, I was delighted to hear about the partnership litecoin foundation made with beam foundation.

No it's more along the lines of the fact he would have been a multi billionaire yet none of the coins have moved since his disappearance, and none sold since his disappearance either, not a cent.
Any *reasonable* person would have taken profits, so it's not unreasonable to assume that Satoshi is either dead, does not have access to the wallets, or just doesn't want to re surface, move coins, and effectively kill the project. 
Satoshi not moving his coins and disappearing is the only reason I went through with buying bitcoin for the first time.

Create an altcoin off some trumped up charges about the core developers and small blocks, spread misinformation via the use of paid shills, slowly dump your cloned bitcoins on fools that listened to you, and for bonus points have a buddy fork your coin then dump those and run arb bots the whole time. That should get you your 2 dollars.

Yes I suppose there is a chance Satoshi is just the worlds most  patient troll, who also happens to not care about money, and is just waiting for the right moment to dump on everyone for the lols. Sounds perfectly reasonable, you're probably right. I am going to immediately sell all my bitcoins, Satoshi won't be deriving any keks from me. 
Haha, thought you'd get away with it eh satoshi? Well you won't be getting the best of me Mr. Satoshi, *if that's your real name,* thanks to my new best friend outofofficeagain, who is very smart, and not retarded at all.

taking risk != risking it all
People can take a calculated risk on bitcoin, keep their jobs, homes, belongings, and still potentially have a much more awesome future. If the price goes to where many think it's going then you don't need to have 50 bitcoins (like the guy in the video) to retire and buy a lambo. You would only need 1-3 bitcoins, and if all goes south, you can fall back on your old fashioned career and try to be happy with your boring life. Even having 0.25 BTC can make a life changing improvement to your financial security if bitcoin hits $250-600k.

@_date: 2019-09-12 03:01:15
The only annoying thing that I can imagine governments doing is mining/buying a shit ton of bitcoin to try to control the market. I was just reading 'The Bitcoin Standard' and I think it mentioned that governments hold 1/6 of the total gold hoard, and that they're ready to sell if they need to protect their currencies from any rapid/large increases in the value of gold. Enough demand could eat up their gold sell orders, but still, it would be annoying to the person (investor) who saw how stupid their fiat game was...and bet on its demise. 
So basically governments could suppress the price of gold, to cover their central bank's failures for a while. If those same governments are smart about this new sound money (bitcoin), then buying or mining up a bunch as a preemptive move would be smart, especially at these low prices. Even smarter would be to induce a large crash (ehem, mt gox) so they could buy even cheaper. Who knows if China/US central banks are buying, I doubt they would disclose this information. 
My tinfoil hat theory is that the 2017 alt-coin bubble was just another trick for China to cheaply accumulate bitcoin for later use. There was a surge in the number of exchanges.... exchanges that could be 'hacked'...I digress, in the altcoin bubble They basically harvested bitcoin from the folks who wanted to get rich quick. The move was kind of low, considering they have a money printing press, and probably could have just used that instead...they're probably doing that too. in fact, like Andreas said, bitcoin is going to be attacked from every possible angle. My gut says that they already started that attack, but not as an attempt to destroy, but an attempt to accumulate for use in suppression later. Who knows, this is all so much fun!

Its intrinsic value IMO is that it's lightweight and nearly impossible to censor transactions. 
It's easily transferrable, easily stored, try moving 100k + in gold out of Venezuela, you'd probably have to put it all in your butt, not fun for most people. Now think about how you could move 100k out of the country with bitcoin inside your mind rather than your butt.

Sure, someone wants to get someones password, they phish for it, in this case all bitcoin holders (including Roger Ver, who has a lot of bitcoin, and who is a big proponent of Bcash) got Bcash at a 1:1 ratio to their bitcoin holdings. So, the potential 'phishers' like Roger Ver, with ample supply of free bcash, are basically able to sell their cloned coins to the phished. Are we done now? Or would you like further schooling?

I wonder if any of the pumps/dumps have been state sponsored experiments to see how the market will react to certain stimuli. If you have a predictable enough emotional response, then maybe some state could code up a whale bot to try and suppress the price. The problem there is the demand is increasing, the state could only push so much back into their own hands, which would fuck up the market killing feedback loop that they'd be trying to create. I guess that's probably the best option at this point for states trying to attack the network. Because once you figure out it's not working, well, you've still got lots of bitcoin left over from your retarded experiment. If you can't beat em, join em!
