PLEASE try and make me...would LOVE for you to try.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:55:21
Was this resolved?
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:21:21
We need to know the grading criteria. From what i see tho..there is none because everything is all over the map.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:29:41
well..you have a point there.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:31:42
My problem with ETH is that Vitalik DID give ETH back to those people that lost it.
But thats like a bail out for banks and GM in the USA.
This isnt good IMO. Thats like having endless funds or, printing money.
I could be COMPLETELY wrong, but thats why I dont really hold much ETH. I struggle with that.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:34:34
Because hes posing a few thought provoking ideas and it makes you feel..."uncomfortable"?
Come on man...grow a pair.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:00:20
Well...i was skeptical in the first place.
I mean...to rate ALL of those coins?
Youd have to have a BIG ASS team to do real indepth research and to come to sound conclusions.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:20:31
no, there were actual facts, weak and oversensitive assclown.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:19:08
While i dont think BTC is an A, it sure as hell isnt on Doges level.
The chart is really all messed up and no one knows the criteria for grading.
Thats what we need to know, what is the criteria.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:37:05
So, because BTC doesnt get an A+ like you think it deserves, theyre being paid?
Are you, yourself, bias and falling prey to that very mentality, based on your own personal beliefs instead of the reasons that they give?
Careful, not to become the thing you claim to hate...
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:26:55
So...bitcoin is perfect, flawless and godlike?
Er...let me ask you this, what flaws does bitcoin have if any?
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:33:40
Does Bitflyer accept fiat to crytpo and/or credit cards?
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:22:06
Well..it is a part of the financial system. That cant be avoided.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:39:15
I agree with you and i dont hold any ETH lol. But i have a diff philosophy as to why im not into ETH.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:38:39
I thought NEO was a B?
But yea i think well have some SERIOUS issues if Lightning doesnt arrive.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:36:24
Does Bitflyer accept fiat to crytpo and/or credit cards?
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:43:07
Thats what I thought, internet tough guy lol...moron.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:10:52
Ok but people want speed. For now, the LN isnt really for public consumption quite yet so in the current state, and with the high fees, that may knock it down. But not an A man.
We do need to look at the criteria tho.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:15:21
I like your perspective, Pepper_Jack, you look with a critical eye and so should we all.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:58:38
hm. ok.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:27:51
I do have a speculative eye to the longevity of BTC but..ill hold my judgement for now.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:36:36
lol the stupid ass still speaks!
you probably own like what .00003 BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:04:43
I was going to fully join until they said you need your social security number.
FUCK that.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:47:37


@_date: 2018-01-25 16:17:31
Dude you got downvoted...wow and you only spoke truth.
People are weak and can NOT handle ANY type of criticism.
But yet..everyone on the interpreter wants to appear as being strong.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:56:01
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:23:03
Considering it.
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:56:27
you are a liar and a moron.....you spam all the time too kadudukie...
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:14:08
If he has several alt accounts...it wont make a difference.
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:43:56
how do you send BTC to a wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:13:15
You need your phone number.
Thats what i was missing.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:16:56
Im definitely seeing that.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:14:48
Well i sure as hell dont want to keep it on their location. I want to send it to my personal wallet immediately.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:59:17
ah ok. thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:03:03
Why didnt you just use a 100 dollar gift card to test it out?
Your bank was the issue it seems.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:55:41
Well you should consider Paybis. Hits high as hell but test it out.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:40:27
If youre from the USA and you pay via gift card with cash, you are pretty much COMPLETELY out of the IRS loop.
So, if you create an acct for BTC through exodus, get a gift card paid for by cash, use paybis, then youre pretty much set because your funds never see a US bank in connection with BTC other than the cash that you take out.
Its going to be damn near impossible for the IRS to track you if you have a complete history of going through Paybis because again, your money never really touches the US banking system other than the cash you used to take out. 300 bucks could be used for anything, groceries, hookers etc..theres no way in hell theyre going to know.
I really wish i had actually started off with that.
Id have zero taxing issues with regards to crypto.
Dont cash out tho lol and its probably best to use only BTC supported shopping.
Quick question, for credit card tho, is paybis higher than using a gift card?
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:31:29
Coins such as NEO, Ethereum.
But you need to research WHY these are good to get into. What makes them unique.
For example, IOTA is insanely bleeding edge and completely different from blockchain technology and has a shit ton of potential that baffles the mind....but then it could crash as all coins can.
Is the coin youre interested, the company, what are they ACTIVELY doing?
But overall, you cant ever go wrong with BTC.
It seems to be damn near bulletproof. Its still around and has been through hell.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:33:38
Im with u on that...scary stuff lol.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:23:35
Wait so..where are they getting their BTC?
And if theres no address, what wallet are they using?
Where are the BTC funds being held?
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:52:54
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:34:02
I dont see any option for bitcoin like they say. I have the app, but theres no BTC on the upper Right at all...
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:36:00
At least you can see an option to buy bitcoin, i cant see any option to purchase bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:23:54
Well..its my turn to deal with this shit.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:36:52
You can find the company who has hired the valet.
You can probably find the valet through police help.
You can sue the valet company and press charges.
Have a cam installed (especially if you have that kind of $) in the car.
Its WAY easier to get away with theft via crypto.
So..no..not exactly apples to apples.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:31:57
Not all of it....
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:33:07
Im in the same boat...trying to get 1 BTC but damn...it goes up so damn fast!
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:59:31
I had a buddy that did lol
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:47:40
Well,in all fairness...i never thought BTC gave two shits about China.
I have holdings in NEO, and let me tell you...my ass was hurting.
Didnt sell at all..actually bought most in when gas was at 8 bucks and NEO was at 23 but i learned a lesson.
Diversify lol!
And govt that has that much control is not comforting.
And buy more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:25:53
Ontology (ONT)
$0.545730 USD (-5.28%)
0.00015563 BTC (-2.30%)

Kadookie!
