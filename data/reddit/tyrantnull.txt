Software is never finished agreed, however production releases ARE.

says in literally the first article you linked that this statement is untrue, quote: 
"However, the ITRS believes this does not mean the end of the concept behind Moore's Law, as manufacturers find increasingly innovative ways to squeeze more switches into a given space. Take 3D NAND, for example, the idea of stacking sets of transistors on top of each other to create "3D processors".


Not that it's relevant because this subject matter is so surface-level, but I did actually study software engineering and applied physics at a respected Technology university in my country Australia. 


I don't blindly follow anyone, in fact I typically do code analysis myself on the different blockchain projects that interest me. There is no need to turn this conversation into insults, civility is free.

Yes. You should buy more

Lucky the mining algorithm we're discussing is most efficient on the custom-built ASIC architecture, not gaming GPUs


The impact on storage costs against the whole market will be close to zero. The increases we are discussing here are insignificant when compared to the storage industries capacity at large.


"Why follow Moore's Law when I perceive this untested, unproven scalability solution to be somehow superior"

Moore's law is based on many decades of computer hardware and software development progress. It's as much of a "theory" as gravity.

Forking is ending a war. Two separate communities going different ways. I don't know how long you've been around for but this blocksize civil war lasted years.

*clears throat*... WRONG! 
BCH can scale from current 8MB blocks all the way to 32MB on its current live chain. We also have 1GB blocks or "gigablocks" successfully working on the test net.

Bullshit fam. Mempool was over 200k unconfirmed yesterday, there's no fucking way you paid 75c for a transaction and actually had it parse.

lmao it's almost like this story is bullshit hey
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:58:57
calling bullshit on this story. You would have traded the BTC/BCH pair instead of "selling your BTC at X, then buying your BCH at Y". 
no one whos been in crypto for as many years as you claim to have been would listen to a single person or subreddit's advice alone. they would form independent critical positions from all sides.

Maybe sold to guarantee my initial buy in and let the profits ride but I already do that with equities too. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:19:19
we out here
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:46:33
but not looking back on gains you "could have" had isn't ignoring data around you. that's looking at something in which you don't own, and beating yourself up for "not holding a bit longer" or not selling at the "right" point. taking a 20% profit off the table will never be a terrible investment strategy. if you can do that with 100 different equities and only lose a small number of times then you're doing better than the majority of the investment professionals.

What would the chain size problem be exactly? As in the size of the blockchain itself? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:35:56
She is already gone bro
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:30:22
Not really. Storage is cheap and plentiful. Especially when you compare it against stuff like mining hardware, or most other PC components.

This is the fuckin gayest shit I've read all night

It was still after the difficulty adjustment.

This already happened with SHA-1, that's why it's now deprecated in internet browsers (https websites). Once computers can crack SHA-256 quickly and cheaply enough then that suite will be deprecated in favour of a more advanced one. 
Although admittedly quantum computing does expose theoretical issues with the elliptic curve method as a basis for PKI, new cipher suites are being built that are resistant to quantum attacks.

OP I am willing to try and get these coins back for you - my commission is 10%. PM if you're interested.

Going to link my previous comment here if you don't mind. I have seen this same question a few times in the thread and believe I can address it.
