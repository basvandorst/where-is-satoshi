I'm aware of his argument (which no academic Austrian agrees with, I might add). There are literally about four Mengerians, and everyone else is Misesian on money. Several of the Misesians are anti-Bitcoin, but have made very bad arguments. Konrad Graf and Peter Surda have the best published works on the topic, and mine is forthcoming. Peter and I have submitted papers to the Austrian Economics Research Conference, so hopefully we'll be presenting there in March.

First let's get the obvious out of the way; some trade is criminalized by states. The claim here is that trade *shouldn't* be a crime, because trade itself does not violate rights. I'll explain:


No, the use of these weapons to violate rights should be a crime. Trading them hurts no one, and these are items with legitimate purposes.


Not even a little bit. Neither the trade nor the use of drugs violates rights.


The victimization of the children involved is the violation of rights, and thankfully darknet markets tend to prohibit and select against the trade of child pornography not because trade violates rights, but because the items themselves are the crime.


No, the theft and unauthorized use of these items is the violation of rights.


If the human organs are stolen, then the theft is the crime. If they aren't, there's no crime at all. We *should* have markets in organs; the fact that we have organ shortages is caused by this prohibition.


The enslavement is the crime.
Trade is not a crime. Violations of rights are crimes, but let's be specific about where rights are being violated. The trade itself never does this.

It sends price signals that help in the formation of market prices. Markets function best when those market prices (in this case for stocks) reflect the realities of firms' fundamentals.

So what if barter is a basic human right? The government has guns, and is a walking violation of human rights. That's why we should get rid of the state; in the mean time, don't be an idiot. If you're not careful, they will audit you and ruin you financially. Take as much precaution as is needed (even including paying, if necessary) to avoid that.

Assassination markets can implement a modified dominant assurance setup to defeat the public goods problem, but at the same time that setup, due to low transaction costs of the processing medium, isn't all that weak to the public goods problem. You can expect that those who offend more people a smaller amount will see an underproduction of killings (which is a bad thing?), but the degree of this underproduction isn't likely to be large.

It's an analogy that can help you understand it a bit, but it's not technically correct; money is neither memory nor obligation ("favor token"), from an economic point of view. Money is accepted for its own sake because it is more efficient to do exchange indirectly than directly. No one is, however, obligated to accept money, either at the exchange rate at which it was obtained or at any other.
Take this for what it is; an interesting analogy that can help you go from zero understanding of money to a general understanding of what it resembles on the market. If you get any deeper than that the analogy falls apart.

They threatened to unleash the state on a lot of innocent people.

@_date: 2014-03-14 05:19:28
I agree that his math is incorrect (the BTC would have to be bit off of the market, which would probably bid up the price further, among other considerations), but yours is also incorrect. Bitcoin taking over the remittance system would incentivize massive adoption among businesses whose customers benefit from remittances, which incentivizes the firms up their supply chain, etc. Because the transaction costs are so low with BTC, assuming developments in the infrastructure to improve security and usability (which is a fairly safe bet for an idea with this much money and interest floating around it), network effects turn massive adoption in one sector into an incentive snowball.
Also, people tend to hold currencies over time to alleviate uncertainty. Particularly in remittance-flooded markets, even the current level of Bitcoin volatility (which would ebb with constant demand from international remittances, if they were to adopt Bitcoin) doesn't look terrible next to many currencies in the developing world.

Even if all the mining from here on out were done by the NSA alone (which would be immensely costly even without significant competition, and realistically impossible even if the NSA were to begin mining from quantum computers tomorrow... which don't exist yet), even in 2140 they would have fewer than half of all Bitcoin. Furthermore, nothing is forcing people to use Bitcoin. If people want to switch to a new non-state currency, they are free to. This gives people the potential to invalidate the NSA's entire investment in controlling Bitcoin mining.
As soon as the NSA reached 51% of the mining power, they would be able to double-spend or invalidate transactions, making Bitcoin worthless. This is not a serious concern, as it would cost more to them to do this, and Bitcoin users could simply fork and then merge to a new coin using a proof of burn to approximate the coin distribution from the original blockchain.

If it becomes clear that they are printing money rampantly, the dollar will lose value rapidly and become worthless.


There is no feasible way for it to gain that monopoly in the first place, and this would still leave it incomplete control of the supply and price.


Not really, no.


No, I didn't say they could do it easily.


Incorrect. Users could switch to a different proof method in order to counter whatever the NSA was doing.


Probably not true, no. There are methods of analyzing traffic and invalidating it, for one thing. Additionally, the new cryptocurrency could take only coins deriving from blocks prior to the NSA's mining, and then cease production outside of burned coins, fixing the money supply there. That would prevent the NSA from having *any* coins via mining.

How do you think these guys make money to do all this? Violence costs money, and incurs risks. What happens if someone sues them? This isn't a state - they aren't going to be able to keep money in any deposit accounts, because the banks will (in order to be insured themselves) need to have agreements recognizing arbitration, etc., and that money would be seized. They don't have income tax withholding, and they can't instantly collect taxes from digital merchant transactions. They don't have a central bank to print money (or none that anyone will accept). How are they paying for a Baghdad-style occupation that becomes necessary to get just the basic fees necessary to survive? How do they prevent those they are imposing their rule on from, instead, paying (in Bitcoin, perhaps) for a company to come oust them? It's simply not a viable business model in the modern age if there's no already-established tax structure and state-based legal structure to fall back on.


Individuals granting jurisdiction and paying for services, and more generally the reputation of institutions. If a dispute resolution organization has a reputation for making reasoned judgments that aren't later found to be incorrect (which would make their insurance companies liable, making them less competitive by raising costs), then enforcement agencies can be relatively sure that they will not incur liability by acting on those decisions.


People who want those services, and people (like me, and I assume you as well) who care about making those services accessible to others.
There is an absolutely massive academic literature behind this idea - it's not just a pipe dream of angry teenagers who hate "the system" and don't recognize any authority figures because daddy was mean. The problem we're running into here is that polycentric law is a very, very complex idea that takes some study to understand (as the current legal system you're under did in middle school), and you're trying to critique it (with condescension) while having read nothing about it. It doesn't generally make for productive conversation.

There is a huge difference between acceptance in a physical community and acceptance among a bunch of people on the Internet. This isn't an insult to Bitcoin by any means - its just economic reality at this time. Markets for goods that accept Bitcoin still only accept it in terms of its purchasing power in other currencies. There is virtually no endogenous Bitcoin market at this time, and it is going to take time for that to build. It doesn't need worldwide acceptance, but it does need universal acceptance within a physical region.
Gold isn't money either, though it is universally accepted among goldbugs. Litecoin is universally accepted among the litecoin community. See? You're just defining the thing to be true. It's a truism, and tells us nothing for economic analysis.

Maybe, maybe not. I'm skeptical of the idea of BTC being overtaken by "the next big thing." People are just getting used to the idea of this one - they're not going to hump to another unless there are *huge* advantages (such as, for example, acceptance on Amazon - that would probably be enough to drive a V2 cryptocurrency). 


Would Facebook integration be enough to drive another cryptocurrency? Let's look at why people use Bitcoin - it's anonymous (or can be), and it can't be inflated. Assume *ad arguendo* that Facebook limited the power of inflation somehow, such as Bitcoin's method. It'd still be linked to personal profiles, and Facebook has a long history of giving information to law enforcement. I would never use a Facebook currency, and I think many others would feel the same way.


Irrelevant. At one point, gold had a market capitalization measured in dozens of eggs and weights of butter, which was "small fry" for some merchants. Why does that matter? Bitcoin may reach a market capitalization in the hundreds of billions (I'm skeptical, but it's possible). Who says Thiel isn't already invested? If not in BTC itself, what about Bitspend? That's right up his alley.
Again, I'm not saying that Bitcoin will succeed. I'm just pointing out that your argument is just opinion, and may not be worth much. You might be right, in which case I'd work on figuring out how to short Bitcoin.

That's a bit off. If the government merely makes a definition of what weights should be used, they're merely defining a method of measurement (which is replicable by any private party) and not defining value. If the government isn't declaring what the value is, it's not fiat.

What do you mean "tank?" In terms of dollars, in a situation of hyperinflation, *everything* (including Bitcoin, gold, etc.) will go up. The change is nominal, of course, but the purpose of diversifying in a case like that is to protect your wealth rather than growing it. The dollar is decreasing in prevalence as a reserve currency, and will continue to do so. At the first sign of even 10%+ inflation, that process will speed up. There might be a global recession, but that doesn't mean that we're going to see a return to an economy centered on essential commodities and gold. That's simply nonsense.

I didn't add the GDP per capita up? Go back and look; it's right after the country name.


Erm, as I've explained, it's a stupid and misleading point.
And actually, it's also wrong. African or Indian adoption could do a lot for Bitcoin stabilization (positive) and price (neutral), as the remittances markets are quite big, and corrupt states make interstate trade tough. The fact that GDP per capita (and absolute GDP) is low doesn't change this at all; the Bitcoin market is tiny, and even 100M Africans or Indians (a small proportion of the population) doing minor trading in Bitcoin would actually have a huge effect on the Bitcoin markets.

Note that trading volume is going up, not down, as would be hypothesized if your theory held. People aren't buying Bitcoin to hold - they have no guarantee that it will be worth anything in a month. They're buying it to spend.
Assume for the sake of argument that you are correct - Bitcoin is being hoarded. The people selling their dollars for Bitcoin are doing so because they want to consume in the future. If there's no liquidity in a few months because everyone is holding, then Bitcoin will decline in value, and people will begin to spend more (ceteris paribus). Problem solved.
In a situation where Gresham's Law is taking effect, the "good" money is traveling *out* of the system; a small amount is hoarded within the country, but most goes outside the particular market (as in the case of gold and silver in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the US - gold and silver each took turns flooding out of the US into Europe). With Bitcoin, there's no "out" of the system. It's a global medium of exchange.

They would hire private security firms, but to secure their own property. It's not efficient to make war; the only reason the military-industrial complex makes a profit doing it is because someone else is footing the bill. Conflict is almost never productive unless you can force the bill onto someone else (which requires a large state apparatus).


None of them are both (a) true and (b) in accordance with the criteria I set.


Not coercion. Protecting your property is not coercion. If they are allowed to coerce and get away with it, then they are also privileged by a state, and thus don't meet the criteria.


Since I actually have studied sweatshops and haven't just surfed r/politics, I know that the vast majority of sweatshops are not like this. The remainder are allowed to do this in violation of the law by (drum roll) governments, and thus fall under disqualification B.


There are many examples of corporate conscience, so your claim is untrue just on that ground. Secondly, libertarianism is not "the absence of some regulatory framework," so your claim fails again... and then you trot out the meme that corporations will use guns and bombs when not privileged  or funded by a state. Examples?

Well, yes, and this is one of the things I'm covering in-depth in my paper, though I think it's a different distinction than what you think, as I'll discuss in a second.


While gold and silver have usefulness, this is not the reason that they were used as money (though it comes from a mutual source). After all, diamonds and cows are both useful but are not generally used as media of exchange, so what separates them? When a person accepts something they do not wish to consume in exchange for a good because they know the good will be accepted by others, they are using it as a medium of exchange. Some items, such as gold and Bitcoin, are extremely useful for this purpose because they possess in greater quality the secondary factors influencing the suitability of an item as a medium of exchange (relative scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, etc.). The reason they are used as money is because of these secondary factors, and not because of any "inherent" value (a spurious concept).


That's simply not the case. First of all, value *as* a medium of exchange is qualitatively different than valuation by individuals because something *would* make a good medium of exchange. One is about acceptance and market value, while the other is a valuation of usefulness to the individual. Secondly, there are other reasons Bitcoin can be valued; it can be valued as a neat concept (surely the first person to buy a bitcoin did not pay for its value as a medium of exchange when it had never before been exchanged on the market), as a way to transfer smart property, as a means for ideological change, or simply as a way to get around the government. If it has *any* value to *anyone* whatsoever outside of exchange and comes to be a medium of exchange without state intervention, it's a commodity medium. 


False equivalence. The Bitcoin protocol can't force you to use something for payment of debts. That's what fiat is. People are using Bitcoin because it's useful, and not because someone said they had to.


It is a decidedly academic distinction, because we're talking about complexities within an academic discipline. Economic analysis has different things to say about the status and progress of moneys as opposed to media of exchange. It's not going to act like money if it's not yet money. This isn't important to the average Bitcoin user, but Mr. Tucker, I, and many others here are interested in monetary theory in addition to Bitcoin itself.


Please don't try to play "gotcha" on an academic subject you don't know much about. "Legal tender" status is an important characteristic for economic analysis because it changes the way things operate. The fact that a judge didn't know the difference between a medium of exchange and a money for purposes of SEC jurisdiction is totally irrelevant, because it doesn't have an effect on the economic analysis.

Money, particularly by Menger and Mises, is examined at a national level. Rothbard (as an anarchist) was necessarily a little more fuzzy, but all three were at least looking for something that was generally accepted throughout a certain society. While we may say that Bitcoin is money on Silk Road, it would certainly be incorrect to say that Bitcoin is money in Western society or in America.
While there is an "international community that trades, accepts and spends bitcoin," it is smaller even than the international communities trading the vast majority of other non-money commodities. Bitcoin, of course, is being used as a medium of exchange, but many of these commodities also see some use in that regard. It's a murky area of definition, since it's not praxeological but rather descriptive.
When everyone (or a large majority of the people) in a large, clearly defined societal boundary or group accepts Bitcoin, then it's clearly money. It's contextual, but in Mises' and Rothbard's use in applications to historical instances of money, it's never applied without near-universal acceptance. Media of exchange that are almost at this level are known as "quasi-money." In writing this paper I consulted with several prominent Austrian economists, and one thought that term was already applicable (though in looking further at the traditional usages of the term, I don't totally agree). I think Bitcoin has a bright future whether or not it is money by an Austrian definition at this point in time.

All media of exchange are "bad" if considered in general. I'm American, so for me, krona aren't a good medium of exchange. This is a useless statement, though - it doesn't tell us anything useful other than that krona aren't a common medium of exchange in the particular markets with which I engage.
If I want to buy drugs, however, or if I do a lot of business with libertarians (which I do), Bitcoin are a great medium of exchange. In fact, in particular markets, they are the *only* medium of exchange. This means that, in relation to those markets, Bitcoin is money, and Bitcoin is a good medium of exchange, in the same way that krona is money/a good medium of exchange in Stockholm.


You're engaging in a common misunderstanding of Gresham's law - it only applies in the case of fiat exchange rates. If there's no dictated exchange rate, the legal tender status of one currency over another will merely add to the *market* value of that currency for exchange. One does not drive out the other.
What you're currently seeing is just deflation due to an increase in the demand to hold money. As microeconomic theory would predict, there is significant holding going on because of anticipated rise in value. This does not, however, mean that Bitcoins are not being spent. Bitcoins *are* being spent - on dollars and euros. When demand is sated - when there's a lull in new people entering the market - there will be spending elsewhere (and, judging from Facebook activity I've seen today with my merchant friends, this may be beginning).
What we're currently seeing is a healthy market correction. People value BTC at the current exchange rate more than they value their dollars/euros, and so are (quite rationally) making that exchange. This will not continue forever, and it is not the end of the world. It is a necessary part of a new currency's life - the revaluation as individuals become aware of it and decide that it might be a good thing to acquire.


Viewing money's role as a store of value in *only* its historical context is silly - it misses half of the question entirely. When one judges something as a store of value, they must look not only at the past, but at expected value at the future (something Mises put quite a bit of weight on in TOMC). If I have reason to believe that massive gold deposits are about to be found, is gold a good store of value? By your account, yes, but I might be left holding the bag when gold drops 20%. Obviously we must look at the future.
So, looking both at history and at the future, is BTC a good store of value? I think there's a case to be made for that, but ultimately that's up to individuals to decide. There will be more agreement on the matter once there is more history, and once there is less uncertainty about how states will treat this threat to their monopoly. If the future is so uncertain, then the "buy-and-hold" Bitcoin owners will sell their Bitcoin. I know a very nice lady who sells mail-order sweets and baked goods for BTC, and she'd love their business.


We're buying money that has value on the market, has value today, and can reasonably be expected to have value tomorrow. Furthermore, what kind of money are we buying when we buy dollars or euro with our labor? Comparing Bitcoin to perfection in a vacuum is useless - it's what Demsetz called the "Nirvana Fallacy." We have to compare Bitcoin to what we have. I value anonymity, and I value the inability of bureaucrats to inflate the money I'm holding, and so Bitcoin works for me (though I was caught with no BTC when it started rising, so I'm temporarily BTC-poor). If it doesn't work for you, don't buy it. It's not like you have to pay taxes with it on April 15th.

"Value of the coins **as** money" is the claim I made.
You seem to think I'm calling for a gold standard. I'm not. I'm just saying that the gold exchange standard is not, in the Austrian view, "fiat," even under heavy seignorage. See *Theory of Money and Credit* Ch. 3 (I'm 95% sure that's the chapter) for the citation, particularly the discussion of "nominalists." Bob Murphy also talks about it in his study guide of the book, and has an extensive discussion of it in the second lesson (near the end) of his "Mises on Money and Banking" class from Mises Academy (and I can dig up the link to those recordings if you need it).

That is incorrect, and vitiates your argument.
Bitcoin has aesthetic value to some people; some people originally wanted to have Bitcoin because they thought it was a neat idea, and as a sort of badge showing that an incredibly hard math problem had been solved. This is not value as money *qua* money.
Bitcoin has ideological value. I value Bitcoin even as a token or as payment processing (non-monetary) because it helps me to get around the state. This is not value as money *qua* money.
The Bitcoin protocol has use value. Using the protocol, I can facilitate extremely complex, self-executing contracts or control and transfer control over smart property. This is not value as money *qua* money.
I'm very, very familiar with ToMC... and I'm also familiar with later monetary theory, both Austrian and neoclassical. "Intrinsic" is *not* a proper word in this context. While it would seem to follow correctly from modern language, it is absolutely incorrect in this context, because "intrinsic value" is its own concept in economics, and was rejected completely by the marginalists. It's like the use of "theory" in science. Outside of a scientific context, you may have a theory about something, but if you enter into a scientific context, your "theory" probably isn't one. This is Economics, and we have a particular vocabulary here. If Schiff is talking about what Mises referred to as industrial value in ToMC, then he just doesn't know much about Bitcoin. If he's talking about the Marxist/goldbug notion of "intrinsic value" as used in economics, then he's an idiot. Either way, he's failed, and is using the wrong words.

Money is *only* a tool of indirect exchange. That's the entire point. You can't have indirect exchange with two people.


No one, including the Austrians, has ever claimed that the only kind of money is commodity money.


Interestingly, the Austrian view of what money is happens to be much more mainstream than this guy's. He's advocating a view of money that has been out of style since the early 1900's (the view of money as a claim on society; a collective tool).


And the whole point (well, one of them) of a capitalist system is that it needs prices in a unit of account to most efficiently allocate resources. That's precisely the problem with systems that can't calculate prices.

One problem with that distinction between commodity and fiat, and not just from an Austrian perspective.
"Fiat money" is money that is unbacked by a commodity and has value due to legal tender status, while commodity money bases its value on the value of the commodity itself (both for industrial/other purposes and for suitability as a medium of exchange).
ALL money, and everything else as well, gets its value "from the belief that it has value," or more specifically, from the subjective imputations of value by individuals on the market.
While many observers see the similarity of Bitcoin to fiat money in its intangibility, the fact is that Bitcoin has its value because of natural market valuations for its properties, and not because of a government's stamp of special status -- it is a commodity money.
People are calling Bitcoin "money" because they see it functioning as a medium of exchange, which they are only used to seeing when it is done with money. The distinction between the two isn't even something most Econ majors would know. The reason I even brought it up is that I know Mr. Tucker does know, because he's very well-steeped in the literature on that subject.

No, it's not. There's literally no agreement. The value of money is always changing - no one has to redeem it. Furthermore, there's no "society" that can agree to things - only individual. Money is just something that people accept in exchange because they *think* (to some degree of certainty) others will accept it, but there's no pre-existing agreement that they *will* accept it.


Other than the "agreement" part (which is just a misunderstanding of the mechanics of indirect exchange), the Austrians agree with you - it's the neoclassicals who place the emphasis on the secondary characteristics as definitions (store of value, fungibility, etc.).


Well, actually that's not possible, as much as the Venus Project types would love to believe it is. It's not possible because there are real upper limits to the speed of processing power, and so resource allocation among a population larger than tens of thousands can never exist solely through a computerized system, as a[ new paper demonstrates](
From the abstract:


data is given and production is ignored, the size of the computational
problem makes large scale central planning a practical impossibility. The
size of the problem to be solved and limitations on computer processing
power do not allow for computers to provide a solution to large scale
economic problems in a time that is useful. For example, even under

To another company, and to a court who will bring charges. If there's evidence, your insurance company will have to pay up, and then will raise your premiums. At the same time, you're not going to be able to find people who will do business with you because you're an asshole who breaks people's legs. How are you going to get money from me if I don't want to give it? You can't withhold income taxes, and you have no IRS division. There's a good reason that occupations are expensive - it's virtually impossible to make enough money to keep an occupation profitable through seizure. The Italian mafia actually had to provide real services (often better than the police monopoly) to stay in business, and don't forget that it's an example of what happens *under* a state.


Nothing in my Political Science or Law degrees has lent any validity to the idea that there is any real control of the populace over the actions of the government. What's more, it's a one-size-fits-all system. You have no functional power over the government. You're many times more likely to die in a car wreck on the way to the polls than to change the outcome of any election, and those elections will be between two similar candidates.


Again, that's not true in some cases; even if it were in others, the mob was an outgrowth of *state* prohibitions.


How is this protection racket going to prevent me from paying someone else and not paying them? It's hard enough for the massive state apparatus in modern Western countries to do that. How is a local protection racket going to manage it? Occupation isn't economically viable without a massive exogenous tax base elsewhere to fund it (as U.S. forays in the Middle East have very viscerally shown in recent years).

I think what you're seeing is this:
If you're an economist and you don't like Bitcoin and think it's a bad idea in terms of economics, then you can say it's going to fail.
If you're an economist and you do like Bitcoin and think it's a good idea in terms of economics, you can't really say it's going to succeed, because it's hard to say. There are way too many variables to be able to predict it. I would *like* for it to succeed, but I can't tell you if it will or not.
Most economists who have taken a position are in the first camp, but it's not because they're bad people. Most of the profession genuinely believes that deflation is a disastrous prospect, based on the idea that aggregate demand is what drives the economy. They're not just spiteful people; they think Bitcoin will be bad for society. The minority of economists (mostly Austrians) disagree.

That's an interesting and plausible narrative, but I don't think it's supportable by the historical data.
Basically, there have been two general situations for government commodity coinage (except under debasement, which is a different issue altogether). Either private banks created coinage alongside minted coinage (which was the most common scenario) and would change coinage for customers at no cost so they could pay taxes, or the public mints would exchange bullion for crown coinage at par.
Again, *other than in a debasement situation*, cases in which bullion traded significantly below legal tender (which didn't even exist in many periods) are extremely rare.

SmilingDave has a vendetta against Bitcoin. He *does not* understand economcs (and has repeatedly been destroyed by other Austrians such as Peter Surda), and has gone through half a dozen or more explanations for why Bitcoin is terrible. When one is debunked, he either ignores the debunking or moves on to a new attack.
He's using, for one thing, a bad definition of "bubble." What he's describing is speculation, and *can* be a bubble, or *can* be an important part of the setting of market prices. 
Those with better information than much of the rest of the market (i.e., those who know about Bitcoin and can perform analysis of its fundamentals, like many on this subreddit) think that the value of Bitcoin is going to increase dramatically as information about Bitcoin spreads. Because of this, we buy. This sends signals through the price mechanism giving the market (through exchanges) the information that Bitcoin may be undervalued.
The rising price of Bitcoin then gets the attention of other high-information investors who aren't already familiar with Bitcoin, who analyze the fundamentals of Bitcoin, and either buy (causing upward price pressure) or short (causing downward price pressure). So far, these investors have been primarily buying, because the fundamentals look good in spite of regulatory uncertainty.
At the same time, *people are using Bitcoin*. They're not just hoarding, and Smiling Dave just pulled the 97% number from his cavernous nether-regions.


That is one of the stupidest things I've ever read, and really underlines Dave's economic illiteracy. The price of Bitcoin, like the price of anything else, depends on supply and demand. The demand for dollars of sellers is a small piece of that, but to say it is the only piece is a rejection of the entirety of price theory (both Austrian and otherwise) in favor of sheer idiocy.

Good article, but I have one nitpick:


In an Austrian sense, this is not quite correct. It is being used as a *medium of exchange*, but without general acceptance, it is not money (at least according to Mises, Rothbard, and most modern Austrians). That doesn't mean that it couldn't or will not be money at some point, but that point has not yet been reached.
Speaking of which, I hope to be sending along a draft paper for QJAE  within the next few weeks that you might be interested in taking a look at.

Doesn't hold; the use of Bitcoin helps to accomplish libertarian purposes by itself. Use of the internet doesn't inherently help accomplish government purposes.

That's half of an indirect exchange. The other half is when someone goes to redeem the money, and there's no "agreement" that anyone within a society will take it. You're playing with words without understanding the underlying concepts.


The value of *any* money in terms of *every* commodity is always changing. Money is just a very widely accepted medium of exchange. If you are inventing some other differences, then it is you who don't understand money (at least in the context of academic economics, which is the relevant context for this discussion). Also, don't use QED if you don't understand how it should be used.


Which still requires a unit of account for economic calculation to occur. The paper I cited doesn't require a post-scarcity economy such as those described by TVP, so it applies to pretty much any theoretical construct you could be referring to in which there is centralized economic calculation by an electronic system. If you think you have a way to get around that, feel free to try - futurists have been puzzling over that for decades to no avail, because they're trying to reinvent a wheel that works quite well (and is working better every day).

I know [Dandy Lion Studio]( does some Bitcoin work under the table if you're looking for something you don't have to put together yourself.

It's almost like you didn't read what he just said.

You know emailing someone to tell them you aren't "high-risk" probably means nothing to them, right?

It is very, very rare for police to seriously investigate the death of a homeless person in our current society. However, in a potential anarcho-capitalist society, both you and I (and presumably others) would care about putting resources into providing such investigations, and could thus put funding into having that happen. Worst case scenario, we're no worse off than in the current society. That's the *worst* case.

I agree that the victims deserve little pity, and I agree that it is a negative for the SEC to butt in. My only issue is with your contention that it was a voluntary exchange.

Lol, I was about to say who, and then saw your username.
