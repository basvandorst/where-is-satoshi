People have been saying bitcoin will crash since the beginning.  
I’ve been following since November. 
Price goes up “see sign we are in s bubble”
Price goes down “see sign we are In a bubble”
Price stays in the 10k to 12k range for one money “see sign we are in a bubble”
Look, there will never been a sign we are not in a bubble to some people.

I signed up for coinbase back when bitcoin was under 100... Now that we are being honest here... I simply didn’t buy any because it was “too hard” to set up my bank account 
The look my wife gave me when I told her that was not a good look. 
As some others have said if I would have bought a lot of coins back then I probably would have sold at a much lower price than it is at today because I wasn’t aware of it the wider ramifications of crypto 
Also i believe nothing can happen other than it does so on some cosmic level it was meant to be this way 
Just my two cents 
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:49:56
Somebody should tell the Japanese that bitcoin is a bubble, they made it an official currency 
Somebody should tell Argentina and Zimbabwe they it’s a bubble, they use it to literally survive where their fist currency crashed

2018 is going to be *the* year for crypto. I predict it will make 2017 look like child’s play. 
Consider this... from the time it takes to go from “hey I want me some of dem der bitcoins” it takes at least a month to actually buy them 
You gotta research where to buy them, get verified. Figure out which coin to buy... gotta get that Bank account set up. Theeennnn, gotta convince the old ball and change to make the leap. 
So what I am trying to say is that there are a lot of potential buyers circling the parking lot looking for a space... so to say 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:02:03
My two cents, I feel the same way. I dig all the altcoins and the entire crypto space. But bcash is just doing shady stuff. It’s that simple. 
Spreading coordinated  FUD in an attempt to dethrone bitcoin... its bad juju in my opinion. Very bad juju 
“Is very bad to drink jobu’s rum, is very bad” 
I don’t think they really believe the party line of “following stoshis vision”. That is just a means to an end. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:52:20
My two cents... 
How so bcash supporters think someone calling themselves “bitcoin Jesus” is s good marketing strategy. Sure, like maybe a crypto enthusiast comedian calling himself bitcoin Jesus but somebody who is attempting to portray himself as a respectable business man? It sounds ridiculous 
Also, I think bcash people are giving to much credit to the coming wave of adopters... those people have no idea what the fuck he is talking about. 
I think this just muddies his own waters. I think the next wave hear that interview and the take away is “bitcoin is not as good as the others for some reason I can’t understand” 
I think this could push people more toward the other alts... ether, ltc, ripple. 
I’m just not seeing how the average consumer is going to be able to discern bitcoin from Bitcoin Cash. If they hear bitcoin is bad it stands to reason they will associate that with bcash as well. 
This is all just such bad juju ... karmas a bitch.

Ok. Please keep in mind that the first precious metal coin was not spent in the normal fashion that we spend coins or how we see them being spent in historical movies

I agree. People are confused about the evolution of money. 
The first precious metal coins were not used for small transactions. The first precious metal coins only changed hands after a ton of labor was rendered (plow the fields, build a barn, etc)
Meaning one precious metal coin was a huge store of value. It had to go through this phase before becoming currency used for everyday purchases.

I think you may be missing my point. Fiat currencies are paper money not backed by gold. 
I didn’t Bring up fiat currency anywhere in my post. I’m confused as to why you say I am making a comparison to fiat currency. 
You didn’t seem to address the fact that the first precious metal coin was simply a huge store of value, as is the first digital coin 
The market back then did not care they precious metal coins were just a huge store of value. 
If this comparison is apt (and you didn’t address the comparison I’m making) market  will not care for many years that bitcoin (and most of the top cryptos) are stores of value and not used for small everyday transactions.

I do point out that the first precious metal coin was not used for small transactions. 
I think people assume the first precious metal coins were used like we use coins today. (I thought that until I learned the history of them)
So they weren’t exchanged for small things like a loaf of bread. 
One precious metal coin only exchanged hands after a crap ton of work was rendered. 
For example, you plow my field, build my barn and house. And then one precious metal coin was given to the person who provided all those services 
Meaning, precious metal coins evolved into it being used for everyday transactions over hundreds of years 
Now let’s parallel this to the first digital coins. One coin (for almost all the top cryptos) is already becoming worth a large sum of money. 
One bitcoin  is worth a lot of goods and services. In a way it was for the first precious metal coins. 
It simply seems this digital coin is In the early stages of its evolution similar to the first precious metal coins.

His obsession to have his coin be “the bitcoin” is odd...to say the least. I don’t think money is the only thing in play here... kinda like a white whale. Bizarre. 
It seems he could make more money with a less odd obsession. 
Do you guys really think he believes his coin is “the bitcoin”? I’m guessing he isn’t that dumb and is just using that as a marketing angle 
Also, do you think they thought this attempt would get the so called flippening to occur? 
Or are they just going to keep attacking bitcoin until they win or run out of money or die of old age?

Can somebody please tell me a little more about the attack. 
There is a post in /BTC with detailed step by step instructions of how to do a spam attack on bitcoin. 
Can somebody please explain to me how to post a link to another subreddit, and I’ll add it. Sorry, noob here. 
So they do spam attacks, and coordinated pumps and dumps, media FUD but they only really have CNBC bc some dude high up in bcash has a wife that is an executive producer there. 
They have used the “stoshis vision” thing to create a devoted following of zealots with one goal, to destroy bitcoin. That’s useful but I think they overestimate the fact that the coming wave of new adopters.... simply- will.not.care. About stoshi’s vision or the white paper (which I think they have a skewed reading of anyway) 
So aren’t they limited to how they can attack bitcoin? Meaning, isn’t there only so much they can do? 
My question is this, when will they give up? 
I’m seriously asking. Surely this has to be not worth the time and effort. 
Yes, they stand to make a lot of money but doesn’t it at one point stop being worth the capital involved and the effort? 
I’m guessing the thrust behind it is a weird Moby-Dick white whale type of thing. I mean, at some point do people involved just be like “yeah Rog, it was fun while it lasted but I’m bored now, I’d rather race lambos”
Is somebody involved in this bitcoin coup project ready to spend every last dollar they own in their attempt to destroy bitcoin? Are they all willing to spend all in their desire?
And they have bitcoin.com where they tell people Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin

I would wage that less than 5 (full time, professional strippers) own more than 1,000 bitcoin ... id wager less than 20 own 500 or less 
I’m not talking just a casual stripper thing, who knows that number 
Also, from the stats I have read only 100 some people in the entire world own over 10,000 in bitcoin. That is a staggeringly low number 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:14:17
Not following 
Yes this will let more people know about it. But, perhaps we could say the episode signifies that now public awareness begins so the bubble can start 
Also, keep in mind the show is about tech geeks. It’s not a show about suburban moms looking for bit coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:26:17
I can understand. This is watching a historical moment unfold before our eyes. We now have so much more awareness of the effect of disruptive technology that we are now more aware when one is occurring. I had a similar feeling watching the internet swallow up everything. It’s a fad they said... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:49:34
It appears bitcoin has shrugged off the Great bcash offensive of dec 17 as it is hovering around 17 at this moment 
So can we just expect this constant attack from bcash for eternity now or do they ever give up? 
To all the lurkers... this bcash thing is shady. Just do your research and you’ll see 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:36:59

 I don’t think being able to spend bitcoin matters as long as people (especially newbies) are getting a return on their investment.

Hmmm.  The closet graph is gold. Hmmm and some people say bitcoin is gold 2.0. Hmmm still. It must be a bubble.

True dat yo... I think we are just feeding the trolls. I’m pretty sure they know what they are doing. I don’t think they really believe their party line of “bitcoin scams with high fees” “we follow stoshi’s vision”. 
I think this is clear by a lack of debate on it. You always get this glib one liners like 
“We follow stoshi” “we have low fees” 
I’m also assuming their is a fair amount of paid shills involved in this whole thing. Probably paid by the response not by the actual content

Scam is a stretch... is google stock a scam because it costs 300 per share? Have no idea what the cost is currently, this is an example. 
Might actually be a sign that it is the opposite from broken that you need to invest 1,000 or its a waste of money... so we want bitcoin to grow or we want bitcoin to fail? I think the success of bitcoin is confusing people’s thought process some. 
Look, I think BTC is a worth while investment even at 100 with high fees. 
But if you think it isn’t. Why not move to another coin and quite bitching about it on -a subreddit forum

So here is the deal. I’m new too... one theory is that this is money 2.0. That fiat currency (paper money not backed by gold) has seen its Day and is almost over. 
If this theory is correct then you may shoot your self if you didn’t invent now, just sayin. 
Watch the doc the rise and rise of bitcoin  and google s curve of bitcoin 
Should you jump in . My vote is yes. Be prepared for wild fluctuations. But overall the price is on the upward trend 
The key term is HODL
Slang around here for hold. Meaning buy in at whatever price point and hold until this thing hits mars (already hit moon)

goog point. It is so transparently obvious the game bcash is playing, playing up the whole thing of bcash being a currency like stoshis vision 
Look, nobody ... at least no casual user is going to use bitcoin, bcash, ether, LTC as currency when the prices are so high. 
All the top cryptos are just stores of value now. Them being used as currency is way down the line

I’m just not so sure we are correct in thinking this futures thing = whales shorting bitcoin. A futures trader on here seemed to explain that futures really doesn’t work this way

@_date: 2017-12-22 07:58:49
I essentially agree with OP and the notion that bitcoin is the mall and alts are the food court 
Try and burn down the mall and you might loose a few customers. People who think they are more clever than they really are can be dangerous. 
The public’s memory is very short so I think this will blow over by Jan so I’m still very bullish about cryptos heading into 18
As far as paid shills being a conspiracy theory... sorry to burst your bubble but internet shills are just marketing tool used in business and politics. 
Simply google  paid internet shills and you can read all about it. Saw a story on Vice about a dude shilling for the tanning industry. So, the tanning industry uses shills and bcash isn’t? Y’all, we aren’t talking the earth is flat. We are talking paying a few hundred bucks to some college kids to make a few posts on Reddit. This is good cheap and effective guerrilla marketing. 
When I am trying to figure something out I always google “widget 2.0 + Reddit” because that is where people in the know post. And in the crypto space Reddit is even more valuable.   
Ok, call us conspiracy theorists but I’ll call you naive to not be suspicious of all the bcash posts on this subreddit from Reddit users who are two days old and just throw out one lines “stoshis vision” “high fees”. 
Also, I’ll say this. As much as I detest ver’s antics I don’t want bcash to crash. I think that would be bad for the entire space. 
Also, at this point I would assume ver and company have cashed out so it’s just the little  guy holding the bag now  but who knows maybe he drank the cool aid
So I don’t hope any cryptos crash because that would hurt the entire space. 
I just wish the coordinated attack against bitcoin (the mall of crypto) would cease and they would go back to trying to create the best restaurant in the food court. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:19:16
This is a good point. It takes about a month of getting this set up so you can start buying. People don’t have a ton of free time to wait on hold at coinbase for 1 hour plus. And coinbase is swamped. This might be keeping the price below 20 right now 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:36:07
The public perception is that bitcoin is crypto. Perhaps cryptos wouldn’t go to zero if bitcoin crashed but I’d wager they loose at least half value. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:37:34
This is a great idea. Look, my opinion politicians aren’t against bitcoin per se
Remember politicians only want one thing. Votes. To get re-elected. If you think they actually “care” I think that is naive. 
So if they say they are against bitcoin then they are just trying to find the next bogey man to protect the sheeple from so they can say “look I saved you from evil terrorist money”. 
Just show them bitcoin support = votes (or donations) and just watch the tide turn 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:18:00

@_date: 2017-12-21 11:30:38
If you’re willing to pay the fees then it is... I personally think it is sill worth it to invest as low as 100 with fees included. 
But If the fees are too much for you, then why not just move on to another coin as opposed to complaining about it on a bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:09:04
Ok. Looks like the guy was just trolling when he implied Lee wasn’t an honest guy. I see no response here where he gives any reason to believe otherwise. 
So until somebody gives me evidence that lee isn’t an honest guy (like say saying on national tv that insider trading is a non crime as did ver) then my argument that lee selling his coins actually means he thinks litecoin will gain a lot of value in 2018

I think people are missing the fact that the next wave of crypto investors will for the most part simply buy bitcoin on coinbase, transfer to their vault and be done with it. 
I don’t see them caring to send it anywhere. Buy coffe with it, etc. So I’m not seeing how the high transaction fee effects the next inflow of investors who are more likely to simply buy as an investment and hold
I’m sorry. The next wave are not concerned with an interpretation of stoshis vision (which I don’t agree with bcash’s read of stoshis white paper) and how buying bitcoin as an investment violates that. 
If somebody thinks otherwise I’d like to see someone address my points, haven’t seen them addresses yet

I have heard some claim we are in a similar environment to when we were heading to those crashes. 
So, I’m just wondering where all these safe investments are, seriously. Somebody please tell me where it is and I’ll put it in there. 
Here is my advice to OP-
Knowing what you know now about crypto, can you emotionally deal with this stuff mooning when it is actually a new monetary system that transforms the entire planet and you didn’t put money in...
...Or you lose your 12k (I think you get taxed at 25% when you withdrawal early) because this was a tulip bubble?
Would you be able to handle seeing that you would have become wealthy if you had only took the plunge?
Will you be able to handle losing 12k?
Which can you live with the easiest and do that....

You’re missing the point entirely of the crypto space and bitcoin particularly. The paradigm of buy low and sell high doesn’t really apply here
Also, some hardcore bit coiners will never sell as they feel the bubble of fiat currency is about to pop.

My theory is that one Gov by end of next year will start buying bitcoin to anchor their currency ... this will start a herd of governments rushing to buy bc if they are left out their currency will crash. 
This gov bull run will push price to 1mil by 2020

I don’t think the bitcoin Is MySpace analogous works bc this is a different medium. 
Buy let’s say it is the MySpace of crypto... we still don’t know how far off we are from the next Facebook. 
Could be 2 years,5 years, 10 years...
Also, remember Facebook never said “we are better than MySpace”. To them MySpace sucked so much they didn’t even mention it. 
Look at bcash’s marketing “we are the Facebook to bitcoins MySpace” 
If we are sticking to this bitcoin is MySpace analogy we would need to look at a coin that is just chugging along and doesn’t have their whole identity tied up in being “better than bitcoin”
The coins that are following the way Facebook overcame MySpace are more analogous to ETC and dare I say it, ripple. 
I like litecoin but it still defines itself in relation to bitcoin 
And still keeping with this analogy... that bcash is the Facebook to bitcoins MySpace 
Everybody moved over to Facebook. 
Not- “MySpace plus” 
People moved to google from altavista not “altavista super super”. 
These analogies that bitcoin is the MySpace, the altavista of crypto just means that Bitcoin Cash is the wanna be MySpace, wanna be altavista.

The first precious metal coins were NOT used for day to day transactions. They were NOT passed around by the average joe, hand to hand. 
One coin was exchanged after a ton of labor was rendered. Plowed a field, built the barn, etc... then the coin was exchanged. 
It was until much later that people possessed individual coins and exchanged them for their bread  milk and eggs 
Bitcoin (and all cryptos except for doge coin or something) are just stores of value. 
This is not a bad thing. This is just the stage of evolution we are in right now.

The next wave of investors will not be concerned about using their bitcoin for this type of purpose. 
The next wave will buy on coinbase. Move to their vault and move on with their life.

Look, bitcoin has moved way past the $50-100 investment phase in its growth. 
If you can only afford 50 to 100 invest in bitcoin then move to another crypto with lower fees. It’s that simple. 
For good or for ill bitcoin is now more for people who can invest in at least 4 figure chunks.

“The phrase Procul Este Profani is usually associated with Virgil's epic poem The Aeneid. When Apollo arrives at the Temple of Apollo, the prophet Sibyl utters the words "Procul, O procul este profane" before the pair descend into Hades, where Aeneas is told about the future of Rome. “

I find it so funny that people are  actually buying that the leaders of bcash actually believe in “stoshi’s vision”... come on, really? 
least admit it is a clever marketing ploy... I would be more okay with this assault if people actually didn’t believe it was all about staying true to “stoshi’s vision”.

HODL has become a mantra for not selling, which helps the overall growth of bitcoin. Typically with stocks people buy low and sale high. 
The HODL mentality is almost the opposite... they always say HODL and buy the dip
IMO the HODL mentality is the X factor in this whole thing 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:13:03
My thoughts exactly! Don’t see bitcoin dipping below 5,000 ever again... unless trump decided to arrest every bitcoin owner and turn their bodies into the border wall. 
The stock market was pretty risky for me when I lost 30-40% in 2008.... I think this is the next incarnation of money after gold and fiat... I will be better able to deal with losing my investment money in crypto than playing it safe and seeing this becomes a reality.
Also... I called it that podcasts would be the next big thing when it was the dude from mtv news who was the biggest star... ;)
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:54:12
Ok. I appreciate all the info for new comers. 
Here is a question that may help further noobs ... 
Ok, I bought bitcoin on coinbase. It’s in my wallet there that you say is not safe. And I understand why that is.  
Ok, I downloaded the bread wallet on my iPhone. So is bread wallet offline and is this called cold storage??
Ok, so how do I transfer my coins off coin base to bread wallet? 
And what is a seed?
I’m just kinda confused as to what exactly “is” the bitcoin. 
Like, I’m confused about all the addresses and stuff. I mean I have figured out how to convert cryptos (I’ve bought some altcoins) buy using evercoin. 
But still just confused as to what thing represents my coin? What is the difference between my coin wallet address and the “key” to my coins? 
*Edit- spelling mistake 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:17:10
I never said old money was “bad” ... that would be a moral, value judgment on this situation. I am merely observing the current environment and what appears to be a new situation that thereby  requires a new type of currency. 
“Old money” (silver coins) was one of man kinds best achievements, inventions, etc ... I live in a town that minted some of the first silver coins in 500 BC. I don’t think that is “bad” at all. Quite the opposite. 
Moving from The gold standard to fiat also can be argued was another advancement on money ... because it showed that money didn’t have to be backed by a shiny mineral to have value. It just needed to have trust.  
Are you saying that cryptos are a slower way to move currency around the globe than fiat?
If so let’s do a test. You send me 1 USD with the current  means (PayPal whatever) And I will send you 1 DOGE coin. 
I’ll provide you with my wallet address and vice versa and I’ll send you my info to use PayPal. 
I’m new crypto but I’m pretty sure I’ll win 
I’m curious how you conceptualize the internet as decentralized.

I agree that that this is important on a psychological level. Also, what about referring to 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 of a bitcoin with a unique name. 
For the sake of argument call 1/8 a Bostro, 1/4 a Bhyme and a 1/2 Bippa
Talking to your grandmother about Bitcoin... 
Me- grandma you should but coin
Grandma- Can’t one coin cost 50,000
Me- sure buy you can afford to buy a Bostro of it
Grandma- what’s that?
Me- 1/8 of a bitcoin
Grandma- then get me on the internets and buy me one of them der Bostros!!
Obviously these names are just place holders. I found them on Finnegans Wake... which is where the name “quark” was found by the scientist who discovered it. 
Then websites could also provide the price of 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 ... this makes it psychologically easier to take the plunge 
i think it works better for 1/8 to be a Bippa, 1/4 to be a Bhyme, and 1/2 to be a Bostro

I agree with this so much. 
I posted my idea for names a few days ago. 
I think this is so important for buy in after the new year. We are getting so far away from what ordinary people can afford to buy. 
I proposed we come up with names for 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 of bitcoin. 
I propose- 
1/8 = Bippa, 
1/4 = Bhyme
1/2= Bostro
I came up with the names by looking at Finnegans Wake. As you may know this is where the name for the quark was found. 
My thought was to keep everything with a B.
I still think we are a ways from referring to it in terms of stoshis but prob in 2019 it will start to make since bc numbers will be so huge

In the spirit of helping the cause, I’ll share something embarrassing to admit. I have found coinbase easier than the other exchanges, in part, because the font is bigger. I know it seems trite (or maybe it’s not) but this makes it easier to navigate for me. I am in the process of setting up on kraken and my head was spinning. So much text... so small :-/
Maybe there are simpler user interfaces than coinbase. Is GDAX good?

It hit me that we are in a economic paradigm shift when I told my friend who is a fancy economics professor. (She told me amazon had no value in 2002, lol) that I know someone who became rich off an altcoin. I said he bought it for pennies and it is now worth 300... she said he should cash out. 
When I told her he was holding she couldn’t believe why... the rules say buy low and sell high. This is not stock, this is something different. Now the thought is, buy when you can. Hodl, buy the dip, hodl... when has that mind set existed in stock market history ... I’m seriously asking...

It’s actually kind of really important 
It is a philosophy that you don’t sale your coins until ... well until a new economic system is in place.
This throws off the conventional wisdom of buy low and sale high. Around here it’s HODL and buy the dip

Your assuming I found setting up an online bank account was easy ;-)
I think you are onto something... that it sounds scary. Yes, it is new and different so it is more difficult to overcome that. It clouds the intellect. 
Setting up a wallet. Ok, that’s easy. But first you have to learn what a wallet is. Google- what is a crypto wallet + Reddit 
Ok then you have to find a good wallet. Google, what is a crypt wallet + Reddit. 
THEN you are ready to go. That is a fair amount of research to just get a wallet. 
I told a very intelligent friend about bitcoin. He is average to above average in computer skills and holds a professional job...”doctor lawyer Indian chief type thing”
He says I’m going to buy some. Hangs up and calls me 30 mins later... asking how he buys bitcoin on shapeshifter...so I have to explain what that is. 
Understanding crypto is like a paradigm shift and until you have that shift it’s hard to grasp.

I know quite a bit, AMA ;)
I was skeptical of astrology before I got my birth chart done. Your birth chart uses the latitude and longitude of where you are born. I have found the accuracy to be uncanny. 
Before you poo-poo it I encourage you to give it a try and then make your decision. I have had people not interested in this sort of thing do it and be amazed. 
I read about the astrologist that did this chart. She is accomplished in the astrology world. 
Surely one finds it somewhat interesting that the she describes *exactly* what bitcoin visionaries have predicted??
She says it’s all about Uranus passing through Taurus... symbolized as a bull (not a bear)
From the article- 
“Uranus in Taurus and April-May 2017 – Our Money Revolution Preview
Story filed April 4th 2017 and updated June 18th 2017.
 In around one year from now, on May 15th 2018, Uranus, the planet of revolution, enters Taurus, the sign which rules money, staying there until April 26th, 2026.
 These are the specific dates, below. The financial revolution that will replace your own country’s notes and coins with one global internet currency will seem radical in 2018, to most people, but be mainstream by 2026.”

I feel your pain...although not that much. Ouch. I opened a coinbase account when it was at like 300... I chickened out and lost track of bitcoin. I only heard this altcoin thing had taken off 3 weeks ago. 
I did my research and have decided that this is the future of money, money 2.0. I honestly believe it will go to 1 mill by 2020... when it hits 10 I think it’s gonna start a slow jog to the space... when it hits 50 at the end of 2018 it will create a sprint of big money into the space and 2019 will be the year everyone remembers in history as *the year* 
I’m transferring my Money out of stocks to crypto. Fuck the stock market. I dont want my money contributing to a system I feel is corrupt. 
I plan to HODL till one million. I want consider selling until then... we’ll, maybe at 500,000 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:15:41
I have figured it out. I have also figured out how to buy crypto currency (besides the ones on coinbase) which was difficult. 
The average skill level computer user can buy coin on coinbase but not the other alt coins. No way.
I think tech people are ignorant to just how ignorant normal folks are of computers. When I first got into bitcoin, looking to buy I was frustrated by just how complex even the beginner guides were. 
It almost takes a intermediate person to explain it to the noob. Y’all are just on another level of understanding which makes it hard to dumb it down. 
Just offering my two cents as a above average... perhaps just slightly... computer user

Welllll... interesting that you say mention it  ...as I learned today that in Hebrew gematria Nakamoto = 233 which is the numerical value of “AI digital angel” 
At least it means digital angel and not demon! ;)

I agree... 
do want to point out that I’m throwing out there that possibility of one singular stoshi be called a FUD
So then on stoshi day you can be like dude, you waited so long you can’t even afford one FUD
Just a thought

I’m holding to 1 mil. I propose we will see a dip at 25k to 100k when a portion of Original HODLers cash out this will lead to dip and more buy in for early majority. 
So for example it goes to 75k... early HODL cash out and it dips to 50k then new round of early  majority buy in and price starts to rise all the way to its next plateau, 500,000 - 1mil 
Or maybe it has simply gone vertical gone y’all. And this shit just ain’t stopping until the entire monetary system is transformed 
Money is a virus. Looks like this virus wants to WIN
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:15:05
We may have hit vertical in the s curve. Maybe no more big dips for a very long time if that is true 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:55:09
I love these type questions. If we are going by those percentages then we are still in middle to early innovator stages... 
The more I think about it the more I don’t think we are in early majority  phase. 
At  most we are leaving innovator  and entering early adopter phase 
My two cents 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:30:34
It is a fair point. If we take this from a historical perspective (and the end game is complete restructuring of the entire economic system. 
Then We might say that we are leaving the innovators and heading into early adopters phase. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:05:06
Ditto. Have another 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:03:37
As a noob I’d like to offer my experience to help y’all kind of get an idea of how this is looked at by the coming adopters. It’s looked at as a investment. It’s sooo difficult to figure out even how to freakin buy it as a newcomer much less start buying shot with it. 
And I have above average computer skills too. So good only knows for people with below average  computer skills 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:03:32
When we hit 10k have we gone vertical on the s curve ? Or are we already there. Think we are heading out of the knee of the s curve 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:57:07
The struggle is real with convincing the wife. The technique I used was by saying - your opinion on this matter is not valid until you watch this certain video and read this certain article/essay 
She would say “yeah but it’s a bubble, we lost our chance”
I say- “did you watch the bitcoin doc? Did you read the essay on the s-curve”?
She says- no
Then I said “you’re opinion is not valid until you read these things”
This approach worked 
It puts the ball into the other persons court to actually do the research instead of just randomly throwing out opinions based on no facts
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:53:32
How is this off topic?? Also... this is like the exact opposite of FUD, lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:22:59
I’m not saying it want be used for transactions... I think the stoshi will be used for transactions when bitcoin reaches the million dollar values 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:04:00
I think this tweet demonstrates we are not in a bubble because all the experts define a bubble as when everybody has bought in, this clearly illustrates how we are just in the early phase. 
Here is my go at it ...
2017- how do I buy bitcoin 
2018- show me how to buy bitcoin 
2019- no turkey for you unless you help me open a coinbase account to buy some 
2020- what’s an altcoin
2022- show me how to buy altcoin
2023- you’re sitting at the head of the table this year!!
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:40:25
I agree. Big money is already moving into the space...that futures trading stuff, twinklevos twins, big banks working with ripple... this is all good. It means the Blockchain virus is spreading and it will transform the whole system. Just y’all watch... remember seeing old abandoned blockbusters? Imagine that with banks. 
Hodl y’all. I know I am... the Bible mistranslated it- the Geeks, not the meek, will inherit the earth. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:17:43
Yes changing the terms for how we talk about it important for this next stage 
I propose these names-
1/8 Of bitcoin. A Bippa 
1/4 of bitcoin a Bhyme 
1/2 of bitcoin a Bostro

Hey lurking bitcoin newbies. This stuff is legit. Keep researching then buy some.

The following is from another astrologist’s reading. 
At a glimpse, Uranus in Taurus is going to be about a change, usually very unexpected, in the way that we use finance. This could mean something like a new currency such as Bitcoin or a new form of taxation. Whatever it is, at the time is will seem revolutionary, but soon it will become our regular way of doing things on a financial front and we will wonder how we ever did business without it.
In astrology, Uranus in Taurus basically means ‘follow the money’. The planet Uranus represents freedom and when it is in Taurus it is asking us how we are being chained down by money issues and how we can escape this. We will see this on a global scale starting in 2018 and it may be that people start to get fed up of rising prices and the inability to afford housing, as an example, and will start to fight against this through demonstrations or other kinds of civil rebellion.

I like to joke (to myself) that I am the last early adopter and the first of the early majority. 
I think it is wrong to assume the early majority can’t grasp what this whole thing is about.  I *get* it and others will too 
Just be patient with us early majority and teach us thy ways 
For the record I think in the history books Jan 2018 will be the mark of the beginning of early majority. Or after 10,000 k Mark. 
Just saying... I like to guess specific dates for this type thing 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:04:14
I agree. A rising tide lifts all ships. I think we will look back at these days and be amazed that any top 10 crypto every traded below 100. Research ripple. The banks are adopting it to replace SWIFT. And stellar lumens, which is a break away form of ripple (what do they call it when the coins spilt?) 
Stellar lumens up 48% at the time of  writing this. 
So we are a little late to the party... the meat lovers pizza is all gone but plenty of cheese slices left. This is just my opinion 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:32:20
The theory is that we are moving to a new form of currency. The theory is that because this is a reality...all bets are off. 
Can you imagine when the first silver coin was minted? What, 499 BC or something. We still essentially use something that is not that different, fiat...And you can honestly argue that humans will not evolve past this form of money? 
That in the age where people have magickal devices in their hands 24/7 that let them access all of the worlds media environments  past and present at the touch of a thumb ... that in this age, the old form of currency is not going to become obsolete? 
Money is like living organism... it’s flowing where the better food is so to say. 
Maybe I’m wrong. But I’m willing to bet it all that we are moving past shiny round objects and colorful pieces of paper as the dominant form of currency 
Could be wrong. Let’s check back in on 2020 ;)
If I’m wrong... you hiring dog?? ����
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:19:23
I’m trying to do the same. Slowing turning on the wife... at least I can turn her on somehow these days, rim shot
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:36:26
Do the Bitcoin Cash people really think the coming new hoard of adopters really cares about using bitcoin for transactions?
Why is it still an argument that bitcoin is not just a store of value and is gold 2.0?
 I’m guessing they are just saying this to drive up price of Bitcoin Cash and try and spread FUD over BTC... 
Bitcoin will be used for transactions when a Satoshi equals one USD

Oh. And they tulip mania graph is not “accurate”. It was just drawn randomly. They doesn’t look like legit 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:43:15
Great point op. When the stock market keeps tanking and cryptos are still holding their own... if you don’t think people are going to start more seriously investing in crypto then I honestly question why you are here. No offense
