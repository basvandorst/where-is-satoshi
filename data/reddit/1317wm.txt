Thank you!  You are correct, it was a rough draft.  So, you don't buy those supporting concepts? They don't make any sense to you?  Thanks.
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:02:34
Happy HODLidays!! I'd like to create some lntips without running a LN node myself, is it possible?  Thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-24 14:44:53
Thanks for your honest feedback! All the best! Happy HODLidays !!

No shitcoiners here.  The concept was passed on to me from a Bitcoin OG. Did you read the supporting concepts? Maybe the format was not as professional, but the idea can be considered. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:43:32
Thanks for your kind response and lntip! I was thinking if I can just use the eclair Lightning wallet to make the deposit, no? I will run a node when schedule allows.  Thanks so much!
Testing this wonderful tool as well.  Cheers!!

That will be fine then as I only want to deposit some satoshis here to share with my follow Redditors, not looking to get them back... :D 
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:50:36
Thank you for doing this! It is very cool.  I am also exploring to lntip the redditors here.  Can I do that without setting up my own LN node?   Thanks.
