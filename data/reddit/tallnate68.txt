For my crypto portfolio(20 different coins) I’m as cool as a cucumber. But this one deal I need now and the slow transaction is setting me potentially past the “redickulasly profitable for the rest of your life” line in the sand. It’s painful.

I did! Haha

This post...this post. 
I am a stone cold buyer and seller after seeing the rise and fall of the markets over the last 3 months. 
For an example the Coss coin is .80 cents. It was at $3 at its highest. It’s a dividend coin and if Coss.io does well it will easily be $20 a coin. I’m not panicking and I don’t care what it is right now. Forget the emotional up-and-down‘s I’m holding and I’m going to make $200,000. 
I’ll report back this year when it happens.

The amount of upfront coins I can get rapidly decreases with each hour that goes by that the Bitcoin network takes to process my money. Time is so crucial right now.

The next 2 hours are going to break me I swear.

Are you sure you’re mining Bitcoin? Unless you have Antminers you will do way better mining a lesser known crypto currency, sell or trade them for Bitcoin.

I found the guy that trusts his Government way to much! LOL

I’m not sure what is going on. I have a few ideas, but I’m holding. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:11:10
I’m holding you to this!!! Haha
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:43:56
HODL going well guys!!! Haha

I see what you’re saying, but all the good and amazing stuff that blockchain technology can do is going to be fun investing in new amazing start ups that are changing our world.

I do own 1 tasty bitcoin so I’m not rich, but I do have enough to buy a nice steak dinner! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:34:16
My wallets have Eth, Ltc, Xrp, Btc, Bch, and a few crap coin. I plan on diversifying more but definitely agree. 
Keep HODL friend! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:54:24
We will see.

Thanks for your input!

I have butterflies in my stomach from how fast we’re dropping, but we are still flying.

You know that you can buy Bitcoin from Coinbase at a set price. I purchased $7500 of Bitcoin at .5750 when Bitcoin was $12,800 a coin. There is a fee but if it’s been exponentially growing you make that money back in a week. My fee was about $110. Bitcoin is pushing $15,000, I’m glad I bought in at the set price I did, and I have already made my money back.

Maybe next week I’ll try to explain in terms they can understand that I have a mining rig running 6 1070 GPUs mining Ethereum that I buy more Bitcoin with. Hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:55:08
Thanks friend.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:46:32
Bought a mining rig, waiting for all the parts to get here so I can set it up and get going. Purchased Bitcoin around $7200, have $5000 more to invest in crypto currency. Not sure if I want to buy just Bitcoin or maybe some Ethereum too. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:55:56
Thanks friend. 
I’m going to start mining Ethereum unless that jumps up and becomes not worth it.
