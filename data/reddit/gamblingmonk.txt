Still sitting on cash. That $500 price is getting closer...

I'm expecting a big bounce soon, particularly as tech stocks are currently getting hammered and I think people will be looking for somewhere else to put their money rather than ploughing it into equities as they have over the past 8 years. However, I don't think that bounce will come before we've had a full on crypto panic. The turning point will be when all the HODLers finally throw in the towel. So although I think we'll see 20k again by the end of the year, this won't be before BTC has dipped sub 1k first.

Well we've not had a stock market crash yet so let's wait and see. Of course, if the bull market in stocks continues then the crypto fad will probably pass altogether.

I agree. You've got to look at the context of the rise in the first place. I remember in the summer when people were euphoric that the price was hitting the heady heights of 3500. I'd call it a crash when we're back to around 1000 levels.

Well dollar cost averaging is 100% the way to invest in anything so congrats on that - averaging your purchase price over the long term will definitely result in a reasonable purchase price.
As far as I'm concerned the current price of BTC is so out of whack of the long term average that you could safely suspend your purchasing plan until it's dropped back to (or below - as these things always over correct) its long term average. Which is currently around 500ish bucks. Possibly 250.

Those who bought at $500 and are going to buy back when it gets there again.

I'd hardly call that pennies. Little more than 2 years ago it was 250, and people considered it high then, so I'd say 500 is still quite expensive. But I do think it'll be a good long term investment around these levels.

Fair enough!
