As a rule, they should only promote high trustable ICO's or private ICO's with IRL share, in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:39:14
I don't know about the overall price but it would certainly estabilize BTC big volatility imo
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:39:29
This is a rule for everyone, I'm not even saying I follow it thoroughly, but yeah... I try, at least.

Crypto Investors: BTC IS DEAD PARTY IS OVER
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:00:00
There are computers that can play while mine completely fine (the biggest games are generally low-specs anyway, like Fortnite, DotA 2 and LoL).
But don't let this get over you, the gaming community is very dedicated, even more, when that means they are going to be earning in-game! And with greater propaganda and acceptance of BTC, even e-sports is gonna be using it somehow! In my humble opinion, it's the best ground for crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:34:14
Worth it!
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:29:21
Investors, companies coming up with a reliable platform, further market research, a stronger acceptance of cryptocurrencies, etc.
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:45:53
I see, thanks for letting me know! Do they teach about miners too?
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:44:36
They gonna be able to trade cryptocurrency for in-game credits/products, that's a big plus for kids that have no responsibilities or concerns, I would often leave my computer running when I was a kid doing automatic chores, so I could have what I wanted in some online game. In this view, things haven't changed much, there are many games desperate to find solutions to increase their income, in fact, many online games have died because of the lack of selling options.

I'm not talking about technical knowledge, but gamers are the young people that use technology these days, so they are used to research, browse social media, they got contacts to assure, there is no group of people more prone to use BTC for items than the gaming userbase itself.

@_date: 2018-06-18 01:30:02
I went to write that, then I saw it's in the first comment, in a flash of a second I thought I was being a smartass, am I actually dumb?
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:32:52
And there goes the hype...
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:15:03
Indeed, literally anything can change value given different situations. Perhaps with a increase of userbase and a market cap of 1 trillion this might change.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:54:39
Why are we focusing pokemon that was literally the only "failure"! It laid the foundation for a new generation of fans and ideas that Nintendo are currently working with.

That still can be a lot of money, depending on the perspective, also, is there not a way to actually trace Satoshi? Like, seriously?...
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:08:15
Inst such arbitrary argument the way that how you're facing the issue? Market cap exists for nearly everything countable on the market.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:35:23
Confess?! Is that a crime now?! Jokes aside, good thing, people like Tim Draper can rise awareness and trust among users to increase BTC demand again

If we are millionary when we reach the Moon, what about Mars?
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:14:11
Yes, so it's only natural the market might be going bad for now, BTC is bound to reach it's true value soon.

Did you buy the wagen with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:54:19
Reddit model does not allow that.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:21:11
Indeed, what happened with cryptocurrency is just unprecendent. "Also, why would I buy anything with it if it going to double on value tomorrow?" that's not what normally happens, that's why BTC is a risky investment right now.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:39:17
Especially the memes, stop over\-using memes for God's sake, it gets tiring really fast and sometimes it doenst makes sense.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:42:56
Very high considering you can end up in a bullish market in few months and most of your effort will have give you tons of profit.
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:38:51
Some News are just not spredead out enough, maybe just few Dutch investors and people here on Reddit know about that, and it doesn't make enough difference to change the market flow.
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:26:00
It's called inflation.

This is still very good, where I live most people still think bitcoin is some sort of digital scam.

Has someone tried to ask Satoshi what symbol he wants for himself?
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:39:09
Investors especially the newcomers don't look much at the product but at it's profiting potential, it just happens bitcoin is a bit different from the general product they invest on.
