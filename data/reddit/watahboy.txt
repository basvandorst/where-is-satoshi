Anything you read is speculative bullshit, we're all just along for the ride trying to reassure ourselves we've made an educated decision.

Are they in any way close to a web or mobile interface? I've looked at it before but I don't want to download and install software for a low volume (although noble) exchange.

In the arduino ide if you have installed and added the esp32 board you go to the menu and sketch/include library/manage libraries and it should come up if you search from there. I just wanted to be clear I was not using the adafruit library. 
Alternatively you can get the library here as well. 
I hope that helps!

So the sketch successfully uploaded and that is what the oled is showing? Maybe you skipped over the wifi settings in the sketch? Make sure to place your wifi info into the quotes.
If I get some free time, probably the weekend I can make a guide if you are still having trouble. I'd hate for you to have bought the board as a waste. 
    // wifi settings
    const char* host     = "api.coindesk.com";
    const char* ssid     = "PUT YOUR SSID HERE";  // REPLACE THIS TO YOUR WIFI SETTINGS
    const char* password = "PUT YOUR PASSWORD HERE";  // Ditto

Sorry I might have assumed that people would already have the esp8266 board installed if they were going to work with the ESP32. 
Looks like it is included in the Arduino esp8266 libraries. They list it on github  there are various installation instructions there , I hope that covers all the libraries you will need.

I'm a huge fan of your books and lectures, probably because the nerds in this space find you very easy to relate to. I am very excited for your new book coming out. I just wanted to say thanks for explaining things and using examples that make it easier for me to annoy my friends and coworkers with cryptocurrency rants. 
Any chance of an AMA in the near future? I'd just like to see how the questions and responses would change since your last one 3 years ago.

I read your whole response in your voice. Hearing from will be the  highlight of my weekend. I see all the videos and traveling you are doing and I'm just being cheeky. I love your work and you help me relate to what is going on. You do an amazing job and the mic won't stop me from subscribing. I hope to see you around Boston again.

Yup just delete the following lines at the end

I power them off usb with no issues at all. There are also some variants that use an 18650 battery or a lipo pack for power as well.

With all the bitcoin hype and these board available on the cheap I had to get one working.
I took the code from  and modified it for an esp32. The real author of the code, I simply modified it a bit. 
Using Arduino IDE 1.8.2
Assuming the esp32 board is installed in the arduino ide. Set to WEMOS LOLIN32.
Using the Oled Driver from library manager "ESP8266 and ESP32 Oled Driver for SSD1306 display"
***Using the Webserver.h library from 
Just copy and paste the code below into the Arduino IDE and make sure the libraries are already installed
The built in oled is already SDA gpio5 and SCL gpio4 so you can change that to an external oled if needed.
Then put your SSID and Password into the sketch before uploading.
The final delay in the code is the refresh period in seconds, this one is set to every 15 secs. If you plan on using a battery or want to save power you can increase that. 
I'm still new at all this and I'm planning on adding led's and want to use the touch pins to switch cryptocurrencies but this is a start....

I wish I had the space for a 3d printer or a workshop. Also my attention span keeps me perpetually prototyping so I almost never finish my project builds in fear blocking the way for further improvements. There are other versions of the esp32/esp8266 with oled (attached or separate) with a more square foot print that might be neater to box, but these are what I had lying around. I am trying to get more familiar with the ESP32 and migrate away from the ESP8266 boards since they have become so much more user friendly lately. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:30:44
I'm a little tired and gonna head to sleep but I'm sure you can use the "price" variable to set alerts and modify the api call to get other coin info. It's on my list of things to do when I have down time. Overall its very simple code, I'm very new to programming and even I can almost understand it all and there's lots of room for improvement or features.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:42:43
Its really any of the esp32 oled models, more commonly called the "wemos lolin esp32 oled." In reality this is not made by wemos at all, but that is still the common name to find one. You can find them even on amazon or ebay. If you end up with an esp8266 unit, you can still use the sketch from the github I linked.

there currently are billions and a billion of hackers over-riding the mainframe of the lightning network through obscure scuzzy connector ports that were left unchecked leaving the megahertz vulnerable. If you have a rooted android device you can crack the lightning network in seconds with the free twitter followers app. Make sure to change your passwords on all your iot toilet paper *sheet by sheet, a new backdoor exploit has been found.
Don't you think someone putting 50 btc into ln nodes would consider the risk and is inviting attackers? That's how bitcoin started.

Thanks for leading me to read back into the posts from 2009 on. That is one wormhole that makes me feel dumber the whole way down. Satoshi sure had a lot of shit figured out who/what ever it was. That is some damn good reading though. It brings ideas and concerns that are still discussed today to the surface and shows how the whole space was shaped by a bunch of nerds trying to find ways to kill it.
