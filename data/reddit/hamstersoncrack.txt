I don't get it. If the company can make a device that spits out money without any skills required to operate it, WHY SELL IT?

According to the numbers on the title it takes only a single week to get back the investment (with 0 electricity prices). You should also take into account that it costs the company way less than $1.3K to make the said product, so the real 'in the money' time would be even less than a week.

You do have a point, titty-fucker, but the thing is, once a inferior product pops up in the market, this 'money printer' selling business also go down the toilet.
Although a shitload of publicity for setting a new performance standard isn't that bad.

FTFY. When arrest and seizure order is null and void, taking one's property is called stealing. Just as if for example I would kick your front door, take your TV and tell you that I'm seizing it for .... uhhhm.... inspection of immoral viewing habits.
