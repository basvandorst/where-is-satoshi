What does greed have anything to do with being unlucky using BFX?

Yeah, I've always used Bitquick.  I tried out localbtc in the meantime, but didn't feel the user experience was as smooth.

I've sent them two emails and a third one this morning, but the only reply I have gotten from their support two days ago was:




Ongoing Transaction Malleability Attack. More info:


I need your address confirmation.


My first transaction with them worked fine, but then did a second one two days after and ran into this dilemma.  It's only approx 0.5btc that's being held up but it's still money regardless.
