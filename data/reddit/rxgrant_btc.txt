Bruce gave his attendees a privacy expectation, and you do not need to try to violate it.  
Here is a very short summary of a three hour long public discussion on bitcoincore slack about privacy expectations for the Satoshi Roundtable participants, versus exposing important technical reasons for disagreement:

 Thanks for your post.  It's not informative as to why those who want more capacity are not satisfied with the HK proposal.  This is why I'm asking for more.
* [Bruce Fenton](
 per your earlier question - not all objections were technical - some people just don't want to work with core and want the team switched

Gavin, *opt-in RBF* offers a mechanism for reliable transactions, at a cheaper cost than CPFP alone, and working in conjunction with it.  
Since larger blocks come with other centralization concerns, opt-in RBF seems like a part of the least harmful solution to make transactions reliable.
Do you have objections to opt-in RBF?

of Classic and this letter will convince the Core devs to compromise
and work together to come up with a scaling plan that most people will
be on board with.  If this last ditch attempt doesn't work, then our
**only option is the nuclear option** of overthrowing Core with Classic.
Dear Charlie, you jumped from "I don't agree" to "our only option is
  the nuclear option".  Want to fill us in on why you're feeling a
  little *ballistic* today?  
What are the intermediate stages of the
  argument, that cause you to suffer nuclear-level harm, if A before B
  rather than B before A?

I demand a pony instead of a horse.  If you do not take your horse back, and provide the pony in 78 hours, I will collapse Calinfornia into the ocean.
*  This is a clear and overwhelming demand.
*  This demand has no substantial technical merit.

Cute use of a nonstandard 10-day volatility window.
