It's a trade off really. 
Like anything, it's probably not the greatest to have a central point of failure/loss. You could always forget/lose your private keys, and alternatively something could go wrong with bitgo resulting in them losing/running away with your bitcoin.
I'd have some safely stored on a hardware wallet and some with a service like NEXO, Wirex or Luno to make it easily accessible.

See if you can contact DALA to work together

DALA will take on Africa. Free and fast micro payments with the help of the Raiden network.
It’s an incentives based financial platform allowing those in emerging markets to have free access to financial services (loans, remittances, savings, insurance)
If you know the market, you’ll understand why that’s such a big deal. You’ll also be able to buy prepaid data, tv, pay bills etc

Look into DALA who operate out of Uganda and South Africa. They’ll soon be in the UK. Free transfers between users and Ugandans can already use their DALA to cash in/out of fiat and pay for services like mobile, tv amongst other expenses.
Otherwise you could use Luno, the coinbase of Africa. Also free transfers between users and will soon operate out of the UK.

$200m was the profit figure for the last quarter. 
Revenue for the entire year (or 8 months of operation) would be drastically higher.
But I understand your point. Just thought I’d point that out.
Sorry to be a buzz kill!

He could have picked from 1500+ cryptocurrencies and decides to mention Sweatcoin (not a crypto).
In the words of the millennial generation, “I can’t even.”
