A scam that uses open source code and has a very intelligent community following it... right. How is it a scam *exactly*?

So, to be clear, you're saying this benefits Bitcoin because it allows people to move in and out of a fiat derivative, which lets traders stay in the crypto ecosystem. No KYC or any of that crap?

You can use just Proof of Time but currently only Intel has the patent on those chips. So, as the Chia guys say "it's more like proof of Intel". To get around that, they use proof of space. I don't know all the technical details as I've only just started researching it, but you should check out Bram Cohen's talks on YouTube. Personally, I remain skeptical because I think tape drives can *possibly* be used in the same way ASICS are used with Proof of Work. I need to do more research.

I find it annoying that Wikipedia is constantly begging for donations. Their organization has become needlessly bloated. You don’t need 100 million dollars per year (actual target they set) to maintain a volunteer driven database. Even at Wikipedia’s level of popularity, it should cost a tiny fraction of that.

Odd... Have you sent them an email explaining the situation?

"bloody hard" sounds awfully Australian to me. Just sayin'.
