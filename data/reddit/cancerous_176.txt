How does a Telcoms power to block website assist in innovation? When we didn't have NN look how well the Telcoms treated their customers privacy. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:42:51
After the fact. With the NN laws they can't happen so easily because it's illegal. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:38:40
The monopoly is here to stay, like it or not. At least NN will protect the consumer 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:54:30
I think I have as a matter of fact, I've justified my point that it protects the consumer and causes minimal damage to the ISPs. Now, justify why it the changes shouldn't be in place.

Shitty smudge job dude it took my 3 seconds to undo. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:20:52
Made me audibly chuckle in an otherwise quiet library, have your bloody upvote. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:21:41
Oh so my precious BTC babies are safe? Sorry I'm a newb. XD
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:49:09
No. The ISPs have a monopoly in my area because once an ISPs lays cable in a certain area another in order for other ISPs to lay their cable the have to determine the ROI to be high enough. If the area is completely ATT versus another are that hasnt land Fibre yet, they're obviously not going to go for an area with competition. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:01:43
Okay, so your saying that the internet will be more open if companies can legally choke out other businesses. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:30:41
How does it specifically? It doesn't stop the laying of cable, it doesn't stop increase of speed through development of tech, it doesn't halter ISPs from offering a better routers.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:23:53
I don't think you understand what I'm saying. Facebook and Google are defending NN and sprint and Verizon want it gone. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:35:28
Oh great another bloomin apple user./.s
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:27:02
I'm not saying it causes no burden at all. What I'm saying is it causes a lot less burden than not having it. The burden the ISPs face is a lot less than what consumers face without it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:00:33
Tell me what innovation has to do with Net Neutrality? Just because there's been leaps and bounds made technologically that doesn't take away from the necessity of Net Neutrality.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:37:17
NN supports other businesses. If NN prevents ISPs from blocking other sites tell me what's wrong with that? Why would you not want a law that prevents ISPs from blocking the competition on their service? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:47:42
Oh, on Android I think its tied to your email. Maybe log into the same account that you downloaded the app with? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:51:04
Sure and if your system prevails and we all have to buy a bottle of water for 90 dollars because Arrowhead owns all the water bottle companies don't came crying to the Govt to break up the monopoly because remember you think regulation is bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:11:10
We've done it before and we can do it again. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:31:44
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:44:36
I think gdax/Coinbase will grant. Not sure though. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:34:05
Yes because thats what Fibre can do. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:19:40
Why is NN post 2015 bad for the US? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:40:56
Lmao. I run a tor node, run all my internet connections through vpn, don't use social media besides reddit and Twitter, I don't run windows, I use signal and proton mail for communications and  a privacy OS on my phone. And as for NN and blockage of websites tell my when NN wasn't in place Verizon and ATT blocked Google wallet from their phone and supported the payment service named isis. As for infrastructure investment tell me why companies have come put and said Title II has largely unaffected development. The CEO of Verizon even stated to his investors that Title II 'does not influence in the way we invest. I mean to be clear we are going to continue to invest in our networks and out platforms, both in wireless and wireline food and where we need to... Nothing will influence that'

@_date: 2017-11-26 04:20:00
I thought so too. Just thought it was a good idea kinda
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:21:02
How does NN hurt ISPs? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:46:27
Purchased. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:38:59
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:56:46
Like a fine wine
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:06:43
If corps stand to gain from NN why are they publicly opposed to it? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:05:44
I have ATT and that's it, no other providers will come to my area. And maybe I gigabit internet? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:46:18
What changes have been since 2015
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:15:16
Yes it was as a matter of fact. There has been multiple documented times. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:47:07
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:57:46
The ISPs could legally put the slow down of connections in the TOS and the Govt couldn't do anything about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:38:22
Okay, let's take this argument of burdensome regulations and apply it to the food industry. If I am a farmer who now can use harmful chemicals to grow food because the crops grow easier with it and because there's no backlash of a regulation it will be the obvious choice regardless of the consumer. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:18:07
App? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:10:37
App? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:49:17
Lets just suppose NN is shut down. If you are Verizon and you just started a service and you notice that a majority of your customers are using a competing service, but you realize that you can legally slow connections to your competitors don't tell me you wouldn't. Verizon/att/t mobile did already and don't tell me they will again. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:40:46
Does this have anything to do with ethers block chain lighting tech? Sorry I'm a newb. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:40:31
Lmao. All you laissez-faire capitalists are hilarious. Do you really think it would be better without regulation. Believe it or not you're whole idea that without regulation monopolies wouldn't form is BS. If you truly believe that companies wouldn't became one conglomerate if there wasn't  government regulation in the market place you need to learn more about econ. An industry will eventually have a monopoly without regs and if you think a monopoly is better for the people than regulation you don't deserve a seat at the table. This is the problem with all you hardliners, your all about 'oh the gubment telling me what to do'. Regulations are what keeps consumers safe. Things like the FDA keep your food safe, the DMV maintains that everyone driving legally has be certified, the TSA ensures that people don't walk onto a plane with 25 pounds of C4. If regulation is so bad let's just say fuck it and abolish all regulation. Yeah, seat belts are for dumbasses, right? Oh well let anybody sell anything on the market because we don t have to worry about people eating food that kills them because a seller grew a tomato on some chemically treated lands. And let's let anybody on a plane no matter what theyre carrying. Sure, 15 pounds of C4 and an AK? Come right in because that's what freedom is. If you actually believe that's freedom all you've created is a state in constant fear.

It was a joke m8
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:31:52
Hypothetical burdens? I gave ten examples that happened. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:05:40
NN takes away ISPs privileges. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:25:56
Oh, but then from what I'm getting I can transfer my BTC into the new coin or no? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:21:50
The difference between your argument and mine is that mine has been supported by citation and all you have said is 'oh it hurts companies' and 'oh big government'. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:36:59
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:30:04
From what I've read, ether is actually the coin that'll end up winning the race due to this tech, is that true in your oppinion? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:24:59
Um. The monopolies are here to stay, like it or not. At least NN protects the consumers. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:29:59
Does LOS support gigabit Fibre speeds and reliability? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:16:21
You have not one iota of evidence except for your personal ideology. You have lost this argument. Whether you like it or not what you've said in this debate hasn't been supported with any citation whatsoever, it's only been supported by your personal rhetoric. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:57:46
I thought Authenticator was tied to and email not a phone number. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:08:59
And those things shouldn't be defended? Why don't we remove all the things that protect the consumer while we're at it if 'think of the children' is such a cliche reason. If my points are so terrible it should be easy for you to disprove them. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:33:58
I can't go anywhere when they have a monopoly in my area and to suggest moving is absurd. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:06:55
Your suggesting I use a cell phone connection to provide internet for some 30 devices at my house? And satelite doesn't support gigabit yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:26:45
One where ISPs can block and slow connections to places that are competitive on a whim is? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:42:33
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:59:56
You asked to cover the entire industry. I did. The Telcoms provided in that list are a majority of the providers in the US. And in lot of areas you don't chose your isp, it's already decided by who owns the cables in that given area. Just because the list I gave was small that doesn't mean the Telcoms haven't done more and one time is enough for me. If I murder someone they don't just say 'okay, you did once. We won't punish you for life. We'll just let you off with a slap on the wrist. ' and as a consumer I should have the power to access whatever I want whenever I want. The idea of the web wasn't something that could be restricted at the whim of a carrier, it was invented for information to flow and be free.
