How can I best protect myself here? I believe I have relatively good basic security - but this is a whole new world for me.

I may be part of that 100,000, but in at $6400

Based on all the comments it seems I should get a wallet, considering security has been my biggest barrier to entry

That's what I'm understanding, got it.  Like I mentioned, I'm not dropping any major cash on this.  Just looking to get on the train! 
Is there any security issues/ bank issues when be connected to these various sites?

I'm hoping so, but we'll see! Volatility seems like a weak argument against that sentiment, but the limited statistics in an immature market seem like the greatest concern.  As we move into a bearish market (and potential recession in the next couple years) it's hard to tell how the currency will hold up through a recession.
My knowledge of Bitcoins' purchasing ability is limited, so I could very well be wrong.  But hey, that's why I'm here to learn more!

What is the problem with Coinbase? From a casual investors perspective it SEEMS like a user friendly app.  I understand the fees are silly.
I've read into the wallets and get that it's safer, correct? 
My largest concern is keeping my actual money safe - I.e. Not linking money to some scam
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:10:26
I definitely will - considering the immaturity of these Coinbase like apps and the potential upside of compromising these institutions seems like a strong potential

Have they not begun to invest? I understand it's an extremely immature market so the volatility will scare institutions away, but again I'm very new.
And yes, what I'm investing is excess savings :) 
So ethereum, litecoin etc should be off the table?

Ok great, it seems that I made the noob move, but that's ok.  
I'm very new to even the key system, so after reading up I just wanted to make sure I was on the right track! 
Thanks friend

That's kind of why I pulled now. Was very strongly considering buying at $3000, so I'm bummed I missed that mark.  This makes me feel better about pulling the trigger still - thanks for the help friend
