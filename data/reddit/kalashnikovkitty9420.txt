Yes. If you care about your coin and truly want to own it get a ledger s nano. Reset and secure your keys. 1st rule of bitcoin is your keys you bitcoin, not your keys, not your bitcoin. Don’t be a fool. Grab a ledger and secure yourself.  Any exchange can get shut down hacked or lock your account. By taking your coins and securing them yourself the only way your coins will get stolen is if you fuck up and post your private keys somewhere

I know it’s not smart but I usually have 2-5 k on exchange. My long term hodls I keep in cold storage, but for anything I’m not willing to hold a bag for more then a couple months I keep on the exchange with stops set just in case the market crashes. Examples, I keep my btc ltc and eth on my ledger, while my xvg and trx are left on exchange with stops set. And besides dogecoin everything I buy on cryptopia I leave on exchange, cause most of those coins cost nothing and can fluctuate +\- 200% so I have sell orders and stops set

Thanks for the info and link ! I was more talking along how much knowledge does it take, like if I start a regular btc node is it much harder/ more time to set up a ln? 
I’ve never been into computer science, but as soon as I understood what bitcoin is, and the implications it brings I quite my job as a welder and have taken online harvord and mit classes to learn basic computer science,  programming, and database/ distributed systems and networking skills. It’s a really steep learning curve as all I’ve ever used computers for was to look at porn, cats and guns, but now it’s all I care about
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:42:59
I wanted to see your sources. As others have stated with renewable energy tech growing, and more effcient processors this shouldn’t be an issue. Plus this is a mainstream article, and was written by a fuckboy with no knowledge whatsoever

You should really look into it. From all the research I’ve done it’s sooooooooo close as secure as you can get to a paper wallet while still having excellent security and being able to access your funds easily yet safely.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:56:04
I quite my job to have the time to understand what is going on in crypto, and to understand bitcoin. I’m nowhere near close to understanding 90% of it when it relates to technical aspects. People with master degrees in  computer sciance and distributed systems like Andreas Antonopoulos have spent years understanding it and still learn new shit everyday. 
It takes time and dedication to learn what is going on here. A simple underthought shit post will not help you come close. If you want to know more ask for resources or just google shit. That’s how you learn. You just sound ignorant saying that is a abstract thought that no one understands.

They have invested heavily in software to help track down shit on the blockchain . Honestly just like with cash, it’s kinda up to you. Do you wanna run the risk of them auditing you and the irs making your life a living hell? You may get a away with it, but do you wanna be looking over your back for the rest of your life? Or do you wanna just pay the taxes? Only difference with blockchain is there’s usually a way for them to track you down. Depends on how you wanna live

@_date: 2018-01-17 03:41:34
High fees are due to miners picking the highest fees to prioritizes putting transactions on the block. You can send cheap fees but unless both wallets are segwit it’s not gonna be as quick

How else will they sell their shitcoin? Ln is on the way, so their days are literally numbered. Once we have lightning nodes like we have btc nodes, with segwit and lightning what purpose is there for bcash? 
So yeah they are gonna shill and mislead at every chance they getas for information 
And I agree yalls news sites are good. but I’d go a step farther and say YouTube guys for news. cause they usually cover the news stories but are real and honest and point to shit that is relatable and not mentioned in the main articles. Plus each one of the following has their own thought branch or skill set they bring to the table.
Cryptobobby 
Ivan on tech 
Decentralized tv
And if Andreas Antonopoulos would make new material or cover currant shit I’d say him. But for the record he’s pretty much covered anything that could happen. For the most part. I love the man.
Just my 2cents
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:26:03
It’s very scary. But by doing due diligence you can sleep soundly at night knowing your safe. Cause if managed properly, crypto is the safest asset out there. 
When you get your ledger reset it. That makes a hole new 24 selection of words that you know and no one else does. Some people get ledgers where other people have already set up the seed words so they know the 24 words. This they also have access to that wallet. By resetting it once or twice and setting it up yourself, you are making sure that no one else has those keys. Which is why you need to write those words down and never screen shot or save them in an email. Write your keys on paper, reset the device by and restore using your seed words before you put any money in there to guarantee you have your words written correctly.   
If you don’t know what a private key is, you need to educate yourself or someone will take advantage of you and steal your shit. Watch videos by guys like boxmining and Ivan on tech. They will show you how to do things. Michael at boxmining  does a great job of this in a couple videos.

A lot of the calculations are based on weak assumptions that overestimate and cause extreme over extrapolations (just like similar studies did when the internet started up, which caused get companies to buy  way more infrastructure and hardware then needed) as technological advancements made things easier to scale and more efficient. 
  It would be folly to think that advances  in technology and renewable energy won’t contribute to reductions in energy consumption for mining. 
And regardless of that fact, if you look at the industries bitcoin will replace, think of just the trucks carrying gold and fiat currency from bank to bank on a daily basis, all over the world 24/7. Just getting ride of armored trucks saves the environment 5000x the damage that the trucks cause. 
So like it says in the video if you watched it, Bitcoin will probably be the greenest thing we can do for our planet.
Anything else ?

Well I understand where your coming from, from an ideological stance. I assume you have been watching listening to Andreas Antonopoulos? While the idea is to change the world through financial revolution, first we haven’t get mainstream  and mass adoption. The people throwing money on lambos mansions yatchs and bling are just doing so as a show of wealth. And as early adaptors, I am a firm believer that you should benefit for taking such a risk. But know that for everyone who buys a lambo there are 10 people who paid off debit, bought houses for their family and paid their families medical and houseing bills. But you don’t hear about that cause the world we live it doesn’t place that on the front page of YouTube. I’m a very pessimistic person, but I’m glad that we see this shit, cause it only puts us one step closer to mass adoption. 
 
At least that’s my 2 cents. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:04:07
Can someone post this on r/btc I’m banned
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:10:32
Well for starters your not locked out of your funds. You have your 24 word seed, you can access your crypto from a million wallet apps, on the weird chance your ledger isn’t working.
I have about 9 nano s, and none of them have had failure such as yours.
Have I run into update issues? Yes. Did I have to spend some time figuring out the glitches and issues? Yes.  Did any of the issues leave my wallet not permenantly not  working? No. At anytime we’re my funds not safe? No .
Your complaining cause you have had a technical issue. That happens. This is literally the pinnacle of technology. Blockchain and crypto is a new tech, and glitches and issues happen. I’m not a computer tech, don’t work in the industry, However 30 minutes and some google and I always resolved my issue. 
Had the leg set nano s, just got the x. Owned Trezor and keep key. By far my favorite(and from my research most secure) is ledgers products. 
I get you might be having issues, but I firmly believe it’s a user error (as it always was with me) and not a hardware or soft ware issues. Regardless to go an spam every crypto board saying how the ledger is useless and unsafe isn’t fair at all.
Hell going back to your first post you state you don’t even have your 24 word seed...... which is 100000% your fault. If you did you could reset your hardware wallet and it would probably work fine. Don’t blame a company cause you fucked up.
Lol it all makes sense now, your an xrp fanboy lol
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:53:19
I’d recomend ledger. I have 25$ a week I send to my cold wallet for long term hodle. 
If you don’t want to spend the 60 dollars to protect your potential fortune (if you had been buying since 2017 you would have over 3/4 of a bitcoin by now, putting you in the .01 percent of people who will EVER own that much bitcoin in the history of the world), which I would advise (ledger has a sale so you can get a ledger x and nano s for 150), there’s a couple good desktop wallets, like samurai, mycelium, exodus and electrum. 
How are you setting your reoccurring purchase? The wallet you use won’t do much for fees until you go to spend your bitcoin. Biggest fees you’ll run into is where you buy it and what they charge as a fee to sell it to you and then what they charge when they send it to you. 
I advise buying your bitcoin on coinbase pro. They have the cheapest fees around (for example to buy one bitcoin in coinbase you’ll pay 117$ in fees, and then they charge you to move the bitcoin off their site and into your wallet. However if you bought a bitcoin on coinbase pro it will cost you 28$ in fees and they charge nothing to send to your wallet) lol o spent thousands on fees till I figured this out lol
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:59:40
Congrats man! So glad your moving to actually holding your crypto. Cause Robinhood doesn’t even payout in crypto lol
And don’t worry it’s not dumb to do when your new to the space. Lol when I first started I just left my bitcoin on coinbase...... it’s only dumb if you know you don’t own your keys and still leave it on the exchange. 
Congrats on being one of the crazy people who see what’s gonna come. 
Also + for daily cost average. I read a study that said if you invested 15$ a week from 2018 to now you’d have 3/4 a bitcoin. Putting in a little every week is the best way to go, especially if your just stacking sats to hodl untill you can just buy whatever you need with bitcoin

Sigh..... how man gun deaths do you have? Cause In the us it’s only 40k. Half of that are suicides and gang violence, a quarter are justifiable shooting situations/ cops killing people , so we are only looking at an insanely small people (&gt;10k our of 350 million) murdered by guns. 
CDC shows here in the US there are 300k-2 million defensive gun uses a year. If only 1/10  of those defensive gun uses saved only 1 life, then were still looking at more people saved then murdered by guns.
I know it sounds callous to say, it’s a shame anyone is killed by another human. But the gun isn’t the issue. It’s a tool that enables more people then hurts. But statistically it’s not an epidemic, and it’s such a small percent that there many more things killing people that we should worry about before going after guns.

No I don’t think just printing more money will help. 
You make great points. But at the end of the day our economic issues are much bigger then giving poor people money. Our actual money is being inflated yearly while the interest rate doesn’t even cover shadow inflation. We have criminal organizations (banks and the fed) that are screwing these people so much more. 
My answer would first involve switching to a superior currency. Aka bitcoin. This will force the government to be at our will, since they no longer control the money supply. They will also have to get better about budgets since we can see where everything goes 
Then end the drug war. I don’t think people realize how much money that would save the taxpayer, as well as take a lot of violence off the streets. And  then sin taxing all the substances you just unbanned would generate insane revenue for the state, like in Cali or Colorado. 
Also decriminalizing drugs would put more families back together, and further help reduce gang violence, and increase odds of better education. 
And honestly I’d rather spend that 1.2 million on education so that small town can become more valuable and productive. Because educated people tend to avoid drugs,  getting involved in gangs, having too many kids, budget better,

See I’m calling bullshit on you again. In the first post you link you say you don’t have keys. 
If you had your keys resetting the ledger shouldn’t be an issue
And I’ve been on the ledger sub reddit. There’s always a ton of people having issues. And when I go and look into their accounts, most are noobs who don’t understand even 10% of how this stuff works and the security needed. Not saying you don’t. But 99% of the issues I’ve seen or encountered are user error issues.
I know that sucks and all, but this is literally the cutting edge of technology. I’m a tech noob but I understand that playing with tech this new and untested, well it’s gonna lead to bugs and issues. However as long as the security is there (and I’ve yet to see compelling research that says otherwise) it’s a risk that I accepted when I decided to get into crypto. I hope you find your answer, but for real spamming a ton of subs and saying different things in different posts doesn’t help. 
And I’d be pissed if some kid who just got into crypto reads all the things like this on the ledger sub and decides must not  work, and just keep his coins on exchange, and then the exchange gets hacked and they lose everything.
 
Your keys your coins. Not your keys not your coins. Real simple.

Depending on how busy the network is once you send it to your wallet you should have it in a couple minutes to an hour. However coinbase can be weird, I’ve bought btc on there and it’s taken a week before I could move it off exchange
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:39:03
No problem friend! I love helping people discover all the ways crypto can empower them. It’s a steep learning curve, but it’s soooo worth it. I love giving people the resources so they can spend their time learning and not hunting for truth and good info like I’ve spent hundreds of hours doing. 
I have been watching Andreas videos for 2 years now and his knowledge is priceless. Check out his books the internet of money volume one and two, you can find them online for free, or buy them ( great coffe table books and books to leave in the crapper for reading) if your more technical his book mastering bitcoin is great as well. 
I won’t ask, and do not feel obligated , but If this advice really does help you,  you can always tip a couple sats via lightning (a new tech built on bitcoin that enables you to send fractions of a cent for almost nothing) I only mention this because it will get you more accustomed to using bitcoin, and will help you understand the lightning network and its implications. 
I also believe that tipping a few hundred sats will be the future of how people interact with each other. Instead of sending likes, we can now give insanely small amounts to people who we appreciate or give us valuable insight. 
Imagine if all the laughs you gave people, all the info knowledge and good conversation all got given a tip of .004 a cent? If your connecting to thousands or millions of people, that .004 can add up real quick. 
If this idea appeals to you  pm me and I’ll send you a ln invoice for whatever you wanna do. Again I don’t need/want your bitcoin, but I love the idea of starting this trend

They don’t delete the bitcoin. 
But if you send the bitcoin to an aderess you don’t own the private seeds (keys) for, them it’s basically lost forever. There is no unsend button with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:39:52
Ahh I thought all the links you provided were yours. I apologize for that. I see now that they were all from different users and the first one you linked talked about not having keys. so I hope you’ll understand my being a bit of an ass, but I have very little patience for people who can’t even manage their private keys lol! 
And after rereading my  comment history I see that the other posts regarding this topic was not you either, so sorry again for calling bs, I thought all those posts were you just spamming subs, and talking shit and saying untrue things. So again my bad buddy. 
As for your issue, I would say keep playing with it. I had 2 that ran into similar issues but it just took a lot of resetting and playing around with settings. But eventually everything synced up. 
It sucks running into these issues, but such is the price for being in on the ground floor of tech that will change the world. I hope your issue gets resolved ��

“Tier 1 – Basic hunting rifles and handguns
Pass a background check
Pass a basic hunting/firearm safety class
Provide a receipt for an appropriately-sized gun locker, or trigger lock per registered gun.
Tier 2 – Semi-automatic rifles
Have a Tier 1 license for at least 1 year
Be at least 21 years of age
Pass an advanced firearm safety class.
Tier 3 – Advanced and automatic weaponry
Maintain current restrictions and definitions (National Firearms Act of 1934)
Ban high-capacity magazines
Require submission of fingerprints and DNA to the FBI
Submit to a gun locker inspection to ensure it can house the weapons
Undergo yearly refresher trainings on the use of these firearms.”
“Those who currently own any firearms will:
Be grandfathered in with their current license, and for the 1-year requirement if they decide to apply for a Tier 2 license
Receive a one-time “Good Gun Owner” tax credit for adhering to the additional requirements implemented by the new system
Be allowed a tax write-off for the purchase of any equipment required to adhere to the new standards
Be allowed to register any currently unregistered firearm without facing any penalties.”
“Prohibit the manufacture and sale of bump stocks, suppressors, incendiary/exploding ammunition, and (yes, this is currently legal) grenade launcher attachments.”
Are you kidding me? Look how many times he talks about registration..... A FUCKING GUN REGISTRY!!! That’s literally what the fuck we’ve been fighting against FOREVER!!!
Require dna and finger prints to the atf and fbi for every gun I own?!?!
Require a weapons locker inspection? So then during their probably “random unannounced  inspection” so can they check every serial number of every gun I have to make sure I don’t have anything they don’t know about?!?!?
Ban high cap mags, suppressors and bumpy bois?!?!?!
How the fuck do you think he’s pro 2A!?!?!? Thanks for posting, cause even I didn’t know what a fucking stepper he is. 
If  fucking government won’t respect its citizens right to self preservation how the fuck you think they will be cool letting you be your own bank?!?
Either you are a secret stepper or your lying to people cause you don’t understand the implications of any of these things. But he is literally not pro 2A
Please correct me if I misquoted or misspoke but I’m pretty confident in my arguments that he’s a fucking stepper
Edit: so I misread about the finger print and dna stuff, that’s the status quo as is with nfa items. What confused me was how it mentions banning high cap (standard cap) mags right before the fbi stuff. So does that mean only full auto guns can’t have high caps?!?

@_date: 2019-07-06 12:21:18
Ok so lots to dive into here....
First, go to coinbase pro on your internet browser. It does not have an app. It’s only a website and you can access it on your smartphone or computer and GUI for either isn’t bad, but it provides more tools and such, as well as has alt coins that coinbase doesn’t. But the biggest draw is MUCH cheaper fees on every side of transactions 
Second, the 60$ is the price of a ledger nano s, which is a hard wallet (cold storage). It’s the cheapest and most secure way to store your coins.
  
The first rule of bitcoin is your keys, your coins. 
If you have never herd this I implore you to immediately  google andres antonopilous. Watch or listen to as much as you can, the guy is a genius and one of the smartest/wisest people in crypto. The amount of knowledge he gives, and the way he breaks down complex things into simple to digest bits is amazing, and if you watch even 1/4 his videos you will be wiser then 70% of the people in this space. 
The best way to illustrate the difference between a ledger wallet (or any wallet that stores keys) and an exchange or custodial service is this:
When you create a wallet with a ledger, or any good crypto wallet, you get a 24 word pneumonic seed. When you have those 24 words in the proper order, you own that wallet and literally the laws of thermodynamics protect it. You can get on any bitcoin wallet (samurai, exodus, electron, liberty, mycelium, etc) and input those 24 words and you have access to your crypto. So if tomarrow any one of those wallet apps or services stopped working or got shutdown, you could take your private seed and go to any other bitcoin app, enter your seed and have access to your bitcoin, on any device (including sms phones) anywhere around the world at anytime. 
However with coinbase or any exchange, they hold your crypto in a wallet they control. They do not share those seed words with you. If coinbase shut down, got hacked or just decided to not allow you access to your crypto (maybe government laws), you would be fucked. There’s nothing you can do, other then beg coinbase to give you your bitcoin. Exchanges get hacked all the time, shut down due to government regulations, stop for maintenance, freeze funds cause they see them as suspicious, cut you off cause of new laws in different locations, all sorts of stuff. Hell some exchanges just up and leave, and scam exit, stealing all the money on the exchange. Not saying this will happen leaving your coins on coinbase, but why take the risk?!!
So by owning your keys you actually own your money. This is one of the biggest and most powerful aspects of bitcoin. It requires responsibility (don’t lose your 24 word seed, don’t ever expose it online or share with other people) but it literally gives you super powers ( the power to be your own bank)
So long story short, by owning a hard wallet you are storing your crypto in the most secure and easiest way. All you have to do is protect your 24 word seed and your funds will be in your control. 
I always tell people if your investing more then 100$ in crypto why not spend the extra money to make sure that it’s still there when you need it. Don’t trust exchanges, even though I like coinbase and they have never did me wrong, what brought me to crypto was the freedom to be my own bank and control my own finances. Don’t give up freedoms for convenance .

Yeah I didn’t do the math on that statement. But after some research my  guess is because we have so many gang and suicides with guns involved. When you consider the impressive 400million plus guns in our country id say that it’s pretty small all things considered
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:03:42
Everyone likes to shit on Coinbase. I’m not gonna suck their dick but they deserve a couple good strokes, in as for as your points
A) Coinbase has contributed heavily to bitcoin by providing US residents a safe and reliable access point to immediately get into the crypto game. Hundreds of thousands of people own bitcoin just because Coinbase is the only phone app that lets you get coin without evening knowing what bitcoin is (for better or worse)
B)Coinbase did give the government records on 14k people or some number like that. But that was after fighting tooth and nail for months. Government first wanted all thier info. Coinbase said fuck you and fought, and got moved the number of inquiries from all to 500k to less then 20k. I’d give them some props for that. Sure they were protecting their image and neck at the same time, but still. 
Long story short Coinbase is for newbs like OP or people who are complacent or not smart. It’s just like everything else in life. The first car you get is probably ok, has some issues but it will get you around and do what you need to do. But once you get experience you want something that performs faster and is more responsive. 
And to OP, don’t be a bitch. If you really think your personal information isn’t already out there and for sale your either ignorant or stupid. Obviously it’s smart not to hand out your personal info. But for real someone already has your personal info. Coinbase is probably safer then the doctors office that keeps all your personal info. I mean for fucks sake eqifax and credit karma got hacked, and all they have is info. If someone’s hacking Coinbase it’s to steal your btc not your identity.

The guy is an absolute fucking saint. If your ever unsure or worried find what he has to say about it ( if it’s an issue he’s addressed it. Yet to find anything he hasn’t talked about. ) I really love him and his lectures and knowledge has super saved my ass. When btc hits 50 k I’m getting a tat of him and a bitcoin. He’s really helped spark the passion for bitcoin I have. 
Sorry for the money you lost moving your money around and paying fees(we’ve all be there, done it andlearned from the mistake) ,  but don’t completely turn your back on altcoins (some have huge real world applications if the tech develops, look at substratum,  ven, etc) and never pay any attention to bcash. I hate bcash shills, and those that attack btc just to further their own monetary gains. 
The fact that you realized all this and wrote this post shows you have some commen sense and learned from your mistake, which is the best thing you can do. Just keep that in mind. Honestly the longer your in this game the less stress it is. 
When I first got in the game I’d look at my phone every 2 minutes. Now I’ve gone days without checking the btc price, just cause I know it’s up lol. I do check my alts a lot though, mostly since I don’t hodl most of them. 
But good luck and hodl strong brother!

Look into those alts I mentioned. And your not wrong there are a lot of pump coins, but it’s similar to the internet. For every pets.com there is an apple. You just need to read the white paper a coin has, and do the research. Alt coins will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, because they are not btc. It’s a healthy ecosystem. Just do your research! 
And keep in mind while I hate lump and dumps, if your smart and buy coins cheap earlier on you can make a lot of money.

What would stores have to sell you? 99% of store point of sale machines would be down, item tracking and ordering applications and management would be down, shipping infrastructure would be down. People would have no access to information as their social and communication networks are down, and if your lucky maybe your water is still running. 
If your getting week long power outages bitcoin is the least of your problems  
If however a single isolated areas power grid is down, ie a small town, city or municipality, then smart people will have solar power devices that enable them to charge their phones. For example in a village in Ghana (a friend of mine has family there) they have very little in the way of electrical power. So a couple of them have  solar powered phone chargers that they use

buy 500 in bitcoin and take 200 of that btc and put it on an exchange. Trade or invest in some alts. If you do your research and work hard you can make that 200 into tens of thousands of dollars by investing in the right companies and setting goals. If you lose it all in a week, or you have weak hands then your not a trader and just can’t do thatc. And that’s fine.  Not everyone can be that guy. I’m not. But at least you tried. 
And honestly you’d have to be really dumb to lose all your 200, which I don’t think your dumb ( your 14 and interested in bitcoin, you gotta be at least a little smart)
But the most important thing here to remember  (and this super applies to you because your young and have potential (maybe?))  is the most important investment you can make in bitcoin is an intellectual investment. Learn with bitcoin truly is, learn about the tech, don’t smoke tons of pot and drink alcohol  and do other drugs and fuck hookers. You can do all that after you’ve made millions. For now truly learn all you can and gain the most power you can with knowledge. You do that and you’ll be set!

My buddy recently turned me down that rabbit hole. If this is the case we’re already fucked. Best option is to play the crypto game as aggressively as possible make your millions and get property or your own island and fortify it against said AI.Eventually the AI will use crypto to buy and build its own factory to manufacture nano bots or build scary ass robots to kill all sentient life on earth. So being in a remote location or on a island will buy you some extra time.

Some of these projects could have useful applications and act as stepping stones as we transition into a decentralized world. 
That being said idk if we will get an alt season like last year but I figure even if a small handfull of projects take in five percent of established industries (gold, product tracking, digital lending, p2p payments... etc, the entire crypto market cap will be above a couple trillion. Most alts will die as much as a crypto can (people are still buying bitconnect wtf lol) but I believe some good ones and a couple shitcoins will revisit there ath and push farther

Recent fud would be that bitmain owns over 1 million bcash, along with satoshis unclaimed bcash , as well as mtgox bcash and that’s a lot , in addition to all the lost bcash generated from bitcoin. 
So it’s a very real possibility that bitmain could just super dump and reck bcash price whenever they wanted.

If btc disappears that probably means world war z is happening and I’m to busy killing walkers and fighting evil humans  for food  to care lol
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:38:10
That is true. In a recent talk Andreas Antonopoulos mentioned how good ideas don’t need promoting. 
However bitcoin is still a growing tech. If tomarrow the us dollar failed and caused a domino effect recking other countries, and everyone flooded into bitcoin it would break the system. Look at the bull run at the end of last year. Binance was down, Coinbase was down, everyone wasn’t even allowing accounts to be created. Tx fees were very expensive, the meme pool was flooded, and tx times were hours. 
Are we stronger now? Of course. Exchanges are batching orders and most are segwit enabled, and lightning is making leaps and bounds. 
However each influx of new users is a stress test on the system. For now it’s not capable of the strain of being used as a world wide currency.  And that’s ok. 
As each swell happens we get stronger, more agile and faster. We’ll get there, but a little help doesn’t hurt.
And it goes worth mentioning that banks are not doing this for the benefit of their customers/hostages. They are doing this because they are greedy and only see the short term benefits and profits from taxing people. They realize that they can only ban themselves from crypto and the money it brings. So even if it’s their downfall, they will promote it to make their last quick bucks lol

@_date: 2018-08-19 21:09:06
Wow I never thought of it like that. Better sell all my bitcoin and buy bitmain cash!!!!
Lol I’ll say this, regardless of the fact that in the past he’s come out trying to steal the bitcoin name and miners, regardless of the hefty amounts bitmain and he owns, regardless of the fact that he rage quotes when you call it a better name (let’s face it bcash is a great name and they should have rolled with it from day one) this video isn’t that bad. Granted I’d argue a couple of points with him, but I can to some degree respect his approach in this video. 
If he had started bcash from day one with the calm collected view of we believe in bigger blocks,  yada yada, were gonna start implementing the cash aspect of bitcoin now, were starting our own coin, with our own logo, miners  ...etc, I would have totally respected (still disagreed) that opinion. I’m open to new ways of thinking. 
But coming out and trying to claim that his fork is now bitcoin, stealing miners, attacking bitcoin core developers, attacking bitcoin, misleading people with by taking the bitcoin website, and just being an all around doushnozzel I can’t give him any real credit. I know he’s a crypto og who has helped out tremendously in the old days, but he’s lost himself. 
And now they lost their greatest benefit, cause the words out about bitmains holdings and that’s kinda fucky
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:33:40
Lol andreaous Antonopoulos just release a video about [if we are early adopters]( (about 5:30 into the clip)
I love his point, cause at this point we are still the lunatic fringe. Early adopters are just around the corner
@_date: 2018-08-17 21:31:52
In relation to the first one, the reality is they will need to control as much bitcoin as possible to maintain the illusion of power theoretically. 
Let’s say bitcoin is hittting mass adoption, and bitcoin is 1 million dollars. The government decides to fud the crypto industry by going after and shutting down tether (maybe even getting more coins from saying people owe back taxes or fines for using a counterfeit currency, idk just spitballing here). People freak out and a mass selloff begins, and bitcoin drops to 500k now the government or nefarious actor can come in and buy as much as possible. Sure they won’t get an even 2x as many coins as they could at 1 million, but by doing this multiple times they could gain increased amount of bitcoin vs buying during regular dips.

@_date: 2019-03-07 02:19:30
Only having to carry you phone instead of your wallets nice. You can’t overdraft with bitcoin, and most importantly it puts your money where your mouth is by taking your value out of a institutionally run carrels ecosystem. When you trade fiat for bitcoin, your value is exiting the  system of oppression, blood, and lies that the government and traditional closed institutional systems  carry with out with it. And finally your showing that you support bitcoin and the message it brings.
That’s what I tell my pops about it
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:13:52
You don’t think that will help reach a wider spread of the population? 
@_date: 2019-03-15 09:03:17
They have been into crypto for a long time now, they were buying bitcoin at under 1 k so they have a good stockpile. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:53:49
If bakkt does that it wouldn’t be printing more actual bitcoins. It would be a sidechain or 2 way pegged right? 
I’m fine with options like bakkt, cause if it down the road it replaces the current system then there public accountability ( we can see they hold x number of funds and have a fractional reserve of y loaned out, checkable on the blockchain explorer) 
Although I’m not an expert and haven’t done enough research on the topic to answer with confidence 
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:01:24
Guns and ammo. Both hold or gain significant value if you invest wisely, and will be priceless if the dollar or bitcoin fails. They last forever and can add a level of self accountability, self reliance and responsibility that all bring great amounts of satisfaction. Plus they are really interesting prices of history, and fun to play with in the right environment.

They can’t. They are sitting in a wallet and they cannot be recognized as valid by the network
@_date: 2018-10-17 21:22:37
That makes sleep better at night for sure. Eventually tether will either go big (show real bank statements) or go home (go the way of bitconnet) and the fact that now smart people are going with bank proven stable coins if it does collapse it won’t matter that much

@_date: 2018-10-17 11:15:35
Thanks for the link, if true that Definatly helps me feel more confident. 
I still don’t use tether,  it’s been a big worry for me since last year. If it was a fraud my fear is that tether going down could potentially pull 20-50 billion out of the overall market cap of crypto and cause at least a 6 month bear cycle.
However if everything is above board with tether our next booming bull run could happen sooner then later, although I still worry Richard heart was right and we’re getting a 2 year bear market after last years bull run

@_date: 2018-10-11 11:35:44
Why would I want to broadcast that I own btc and make myself a target? That’s like verifying I have over a million dollars by taking a picture with it in my possession with my drivers Id on it.
Sounds like a great way to make yourself a target. If I ever saved up a full bitcoin I wouldn’t risk it to join a club to brag about my wealth 
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:49:50
Hell yeah. I just showed that to my buddy who mined a couple btc back in 2013 ( lol he had them on a computer he forgot about until like 2 months ag. I started my bitcoin rant and he was like I think I have some what’s it up to now? I told him it hit 20k and his face went pale, but he’s still happy cause he has like 15 and that’s a lot even today) and now he’s getting a license for his car saying 1% lol

Only place that doesn’t kyc or aml you are bitcoin atms and local bitcoins. Both carry a 6-15 % fee
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:49:12
For guys who cost average in these are the times to buy. I’m fairly confident that in 1 month, much less one year we will be well over this price, so seeing a quick drop of 1k is nice. 
I mean if your goal is to hold for a year to get those Lorne term capitol gains tax buying at dips like this is great. 
I haven’t seen any news that bitcoin is technically flawed or compromised, the fundamentals are all the same. So if the price drops without a catalyst that would reflect it, I see that as a sale 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:50:46
If your looking at the dick eating chart then yes 40 % would be right, even more reason to buy. But I was just talking about 15% from the weekly high, and even hat I was just roughly guessing. Not a math professor here lol and Definatly not a financial advisor lol

If you have a PayPal you can make a Coinbase or gemeni  account (not using your PayPal to pay, but the debit card your PayPal is attached to), both are safe easy and fast and will act as a fiat on ramp. I usually but my weekly cost average at one of these places
Almost no one who is smart will accept PayPal since you can pay them and hey send the crypto, and then you go to PayPal and have them cancel the transaction. And since crypto is non reversible the person selling the coin will be out the crypto and money.
Might be easier to go and meet someone in person and just give them 20 and have them send you some then and there. 
@_date: 2019-08-25 18:17:40
Most collages have policies against this. Even if you did regardless, your better off buying bitcoin. Even dude who were mining in 2013 wish they had just bought btc instead of mining it.  If you buy mining hardware (probably at least a couple grand if you wanna mine btc) it’s gonna take weeks to months to get your miner and set it up, and  months to years to recover your startup cost even with free electricity. Do yourself a favor and just buy bitcoin.

Have you looked into the legalities of doing so? Do you already know what model atm and what services you will use to keep it operating? 5% is an insanely low margin. I’d do 10-13%.

I got in at the 3500 mark, but I hope once Wall Street gets involved it jumps to 50K a coin. Pretty sure we’ll see it at 10-15 k by the end of the year alone. It will dip I’m sure, but I’m super hoping that if it drops 1k it shoots up 4K

Why you keep coin in Coinbase wallet?!? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:09:20
It doesn’t cost that much. I just did a 3000 dollar transaction and it cost me 90 bucks...... that’s fine for me. And everyone’s cc gets denied the first time. Call your bank and get it settled out. Plus if you have the right credit cards you can get sweet deals and cash back (have one card that has 60 k miles on it from buying bitcoin and another I got 450 bucks cask back) just be be smart not to abuse it and get into to much debt. Don’t blame Coinbase cause you haven’t kept in touch with your bank and ironed things out
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:01:39
That’s what I do. I have a card with no interest for 12 months, and gives me miles for flights, and another that gets me cash back. Just don’t charge more then you can payoff in a month

@_date: 2017-11-15 21:55:17
Start up cost will run you much more then 10k. The best machine will cost 14 k, and you need to have cash and bitcoin to stock the machine. Depending on your locality you might also need a money transfer license. If you can make things happen it will defiantly be worth the investment. Putting 10k into bitcoin and hodl would be a lot less work and stress with hopefully a very nice return 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:10:02
I literally just got a credit card to do this since it will give me 20k free air miles and no interest for a year and a half. So if I just let it sit I’m pretty sure I’ll be rich. If not I lost 1 k but got free air fare to my snowboarding trip that bitcoin paid for already

@_date: 2019-02-04 23:27:57
First off don’t buy anything more. I’m a firm believer we’ll see new ath again, but I don’t think the bull market will start up for another couple months. Probably won’t peak till like next year.
I’m not 15k negative on each coin, but I did buy a lot around 6 this year, and I’m down 50% now. I sold 1/10 my position so that I had extra fiat to buy more if we go to 2k or even 1k. If you mortgaged your house you should have a lot of coins. Sell 2, eat the loss (should have done it last year so you could declare a loss on taxes) and pay some bills so you don’t get foreclosed or starve. But hang on the the rest. If you can survive another year or two you’ll be happy you did.

Yeah call your bank and get it sorted out. Most banks do this as a favor to prevent unauthorized access. Because if it is you, you’ll a call and wonder why your money got declined. And honestly that what you want. I’d rather get declined and have to call then find out someone jacked my card and racked up 10 k in debt in my name. So Get it sorted out and then you’ll have your coin literally instantly in your wallet

I just got a card that will give me a shit tons of  flyer miles for spending 1 k. And I have a snowboarding trip in February. The card has no interest for 1 year. I could pay it off immediately.

Because litecoin trades fast and it holds its value pretty well, so you can trade it for btc when the memepool clears, without much , if any loss. Where if you keep them as bch, you might come out ahead when you can dump them, or shitcoin crashes and they are worth nothing and now have no trade value. Right? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:02:22
I asked the same question in August at 3000 a bitcoin. So I popped in 1. Now that’s turned into 2300. So your call. You really think bitcoins peaked out without real wallstreet investment?

Is that you matt?
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:23:16
I’m not gonna argue that at all. Very irresponsible thing to do, but it’s paid off handsomely for me and I mean he asked. I did this just to churn and get tons of free miles on my card, and another gets me .03  cash back. I’ll admit I have the funds to just buy it outright, and always pay the cards off well before due. I guess I should have mentioned all that as well
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:30:27
I never thought of that

Idk I think the higher we go we’ll still see the same gerneral price correction, so if it corrected at 10k we’ll go between 8 and 6, and if it goes till 15k it will drop to 13-10
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:28:17
You can get a credit card with no interest for a year and pay small monthly increments of it off out of pocket. By the time the no interest will be over your bitcoin will be worth 10x that much
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:38:26
Well I justified it because I could afford to pay it off, and netted me immediate results. Another question for op to answer is how much he wants to do. I know it is very risky and not smart but if OP only wants to loan 1k then a year is more then enough time to pay it back. Iv know panhandlers who make that in a week lol, so even if op is homeless he can pay it back lol.
Now that I think about it I’m about to stand on the side of the road with a sign that says homeless please donate btc!
@_date: 2019-02-03 19:01:38
Well bitcoin needs to go lower cause I have more dirty fiat to get rid of 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:19:05
I thinks we’ll see a price correction of 1-2k so get your money ready

I did the same exact thing! Only my card gives me 25k for spending 1000 the first 3 months, and has no interest for a year. My only question is how to use the miles. I just spent 1100 on bitcoin now trying to figure how to get my miles. I have a snowboarding trip in February, so really trying to get the tickets sooner then later to get them as cheap as possible
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:18:24

Yeah it’s based on the cars and how much you have used it
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:28:09
Today’s ath are tomarrows dips. So they may “lose” money atm, but after it dips and we’re trying to break 25 k in 2 months they will be so happy. Unless they don’t hodl. In which case they kinda deserve it, from a Darwinian perspective
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:19:08
8k? You mean the moon? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:14:39
Gdax and coin base are not running at full operation. I was worried too, but if you go to Coinbase you’ll see it’s not at 100% for bitcoin transactions

Dammit I don’t understand the hint
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:19:12
Yeah I thought the price correction would drop us down to mid 6k, but  seems 7k is a sturdy floor. Waiting for a new credit card then I’m buying another is worth

If we get to 6000 I’m putting getting a loan on my motorcycle and car 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:48:03
I thought about that. My buddy is saying ripple, but as true in regular tradeing, it’s hard to beat bitcoin. It will dip a couple ks, but it will be back up to what I traded my coins into wayyyyy quicker then I think ethierium will will rebound to the price that I trade my alts into it
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:37:27
I’m gonna be pissed if it does I wanted sub 3k bitcoin

@_date: 2019-04-02 14:19:30

@_date: 2019-04-02 05:46:45
Coinabase pro. Buy a full bitcoin and pay like 10 bucks in fees
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:22:30
Idk from all the research I’ve done they are marking a product in a way that no one else is. Their approach to things is interesting at the very least. Not the biggest Charles fan but the fact that they are investing heavily in 3rd world countries excites me. Crypto will defiantly get a boost from the big players on the globe but having poorer countries actually adopt it will be huge I think. 
Just my opinion 
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:44:33
I have the ledger Nano, just set it up today. So your saying that if I keep my bitcoins on the ledger Nano , that when it comes out with a 2x wallet I’ll be able to split my bitcoin and receive the same amount of b2x by transferring my bitcoin to a exchange later? 
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:11:03
Come on ada
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:01:16
Buy high sell low it’s easy
@_date: 2019-04-18 10:37:16
Yeah it will be a way for them to maintain a presence by funneling their untold fortunes into a asset that Connor be seized. Think about, right now they can just print money and buy bitcoin with it. Eventually exchanges will stop accepting the hyper inflated US dollar as it becomes worthless. By then banks will probably already own a majority of crypto and will be looking for privacy features so they can resume being criminals. 
Just a random thought but one that’s intrigued me recently
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:32:47
If you live in American it’s not as fast or reversible as visa or traditional bank/ financial tools and the percentage of Americans with bank accounts is kinda high so not as much incentive to bank the unbanked. But this will be fixed as America continues to inflate and devalue their currency
@_date: 2019-04-06 06:05:44
Lol what are they gonna do? If miners somehow collude and change code the majority of exchanges would have to decide to update to a fucked up rule change. And then  point of sale merchants would have to also decide to jump to this shit chain. And the. Users running full nodes would also have to decide to jump to a fucked up chain. That’s a whole lot of collusion to do something that would hurt the price of bitcoin. I don’t see that happening and I don’t think you understand consensus.
If your implying that governments decided to make mining a state funded venture to 51% attack the network, that seems highly improbable and again they would destroy all the capital and infrastructure they invested to attack it. And even then all said parties (miners, merchants, exchanges and master node runners) would just take a snap shot before the 51% attack and jump to a new chain where it didn’t happen or invalidate or freeze that address. Again not a threat. 
In every case it’s better to play with the rules in the network then try to work against it. 
And I’m not taking the time to check your user history but if your implying bitcoin cash is any better have you been living under a rock? How about that steaming dumpster shit show aka the bchsv fork. Come on man either learn more before you talk  aloud, or go home

Don’t use Coinbase to buy. Send fiat to Coinbase, move to gdax/Coinbase pro. Take a couple days for the cash to enter the system , but Allows instant purchase and withdrawal of crypto with less fees. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 09:02:14
Lol either way they are fucked to begin with taking out student loans...... and depending on the major they got if they finished school, buying the right crypto will probably be way less then a gamble lol.

@_date: 2019-01-21 19:37:16
Shit I missed that haven’t bought in a while. But still way cheaper fees then regular coinbase 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:25:22
Yeah they are waiting for your bank to clear payments so they know they have your money. After that are sure they do they will realease your bitcoin. 
But if you send them the money first it clears quicker.

21 million bitcoin, 9 billion people. With less then 1% adoption in the us, we still have a 10k bitcoin.  As GUI becomes better, as “legitimate” companies adopt, and custody  and legal lines are made, I don’t see people stopping. If you look at how the internet grew, it was by small upgrades over long periods of time. 
Just imagine 5 years from now when there’s sensible crypto laws, financial giants have the infrastructure needed to feel comfortable enough to tell customers to buy bitcoin and hold it for them. The interface is so easy your grandma can send and buy btc.  Bitcoins tech and hashrate are the strongest they have ever been. And Lightning’s still in its early days. If we’re still in the same spot in 2 years maybe I’ll get out of bitcoin. But because of said listed facts I’m very bullish on bitcoin for the foreseeable future

It’s also worth noting the horrible comparison of having tons of altcoins to the current situation of usd being the global standard and having a bunch of other fiat currencies. Yeah the dollar is the best, as bitcoin is the global best. However with crypto unlike the bolivar, or Zimbabwe dollar, crypto gives you the choice to use it. People in Venezuela are not suffering because they have too many choices of currency, it’s because the government that rules over them forces them to use this shitty money. They cannot hope on a forex and be trading any currency they want. They were born in a shit county and might be able to trade their shit money for better money (usd) if they go to a black market or otc exchange in their town. If they (the government) had their way they the bolivar would be the only currency in their country because they control it. They don’t want better money coming in. 
Crypto allows the shit money to be weeded out. You can bet your ass if they could hope on a phone and trade into whatever currency they wanted they would take any better money as soon as they could.

Start with andreaous anotonopolois. He talks in more vague terms to give metaphors and analogies to help you understand the principals. And when you understand the principals his book mastering bitcoin is insanely technical and will Definatly let you now what’s happening. 
Also great to watch on YouTube is boxmining and Ivan on tech (for more technical details and general news) datadash (great for learning the financial aspects of btc as well as the trading and understanding of markets) and of course I love crypto daily cause he’s hilarious and not so serious, Doug old is also pretty funny too. And if I’m shilling also check out Richard heart, he has very interesting ideas, although most people either love him or hate him. And Jackson Palmer, the creator of dogecoin has great insights. 
I watch or listen to about 2-3 hours of crypto most days to keep learning and stay up to date with what’s happening in the markets and in this space. 
Long story there is a a million shills, scammers and frauds. Be careful, and never trust just one resource. Always cross check between 2-5 different sites to verify something. 
And no problem! I love seeing new blood enter the space. Everyone here was once in the same position as you. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 00:11:55
Well that’s one way to think of it, but I wouldn’t call your idea wrong, just your opinion. And you sound kinda condescending assuming I just trade crypto and do not actually care about tech. Sure I came in before the big bull run last year with hopes of the moon and lambos, but even after the crash I never lost faith and only dug in deeper. I’ve watched every single Andreas M. Antonopoulos video and am struggling my way through mastering bitcoin. And just to point out, we can’t have mass adoption without increasing price. It’s literally a fact. Richard heart talked about this recently and put it very well. 
However most people will or cannot stay for the tech. The smartest people in the world are working on this, and to try to enlighten yourself to their levels is literally impossible unless your a savant. Learning about the tech is important, but talking from your high horse comes off as arrogant. That being said....
IMO special abstract and niche use is what will define crypto. Walmart, McDonald’s 711, they will all have coins or tokens. Using them will get you discounts on things, and reward brand loyalty. Some stores will only accept their token which you have to buy with bitcoin, while some will accept a wide array of coins. You won’t know or be involved in this as the wallets of the future will interact between the register and your phone and will do everything except sign the signature to finalize your purchase. 
Having multiple coins doesn’t hurt the system, it helps. It enables people to earn tokens in various environments that have value determined by the free market that can all be exchanged with each other to fit into that certain environment. 
Andreas said it best, money is just a form of communication, a linguistic abstract that we use to interact with each other.
Imagine your a content creator. You accept tips in any currency, but you mostly get paid in steamer bat by posting and interacting within the platform of that native token, because those tokens play by specific rules.  Maybe your a web hosting database guy, you run substratum nodes and  provide decentralized internet (still ways off but you get me). Or you host storage like siacoin or storaj. Each of those systems has specific rules and environments that are either unsuitable or cannot work with bitcoins code because of the environments rules and structure. But the beauty is that you will be able to go to a decentralized exchange without thinking about it (or use a wallet that does atomic swaps) to exchange it for bitcoin. 
And to further illustrate this is my rebuttal to your Ltc comment. A lot of testing for btc is done on litecoin network. Until we get lightning network running, litecoin serves a huge use. When tx fees where through the roof, it was much easier and much faster to move btc I needed to send with Ltc then btc. I know that’s a fixable use, but it’s a valid one. Also maybe I don’t want people to be able to see how much btc I have. Using litecoin is a fix to that (not as good as monero obviously but it’s a valid option).
And to say to just wait until bitcoin has those features is silly. I believe that bitcoin will have scaleable, privacy features implemented one day, but that could be years off.  To only hodl btc until it’s perfect will have you miss out on millions of good opportunities to increase your bitcoin stack. 
I’m not saying go out and jump into bitconnect, I’m saying it’s wise to DYOR, make informed decisions , and allot 5-20% of your portfolio into risky options, as they increase your rewards substantially.

@_date: 2018-07-25 10:37:14
Andreas talks about that. Technically if someone is willing to pay the fees for to get included in a block then they it’s not spam. They could potentially put a bunch of low tax fees to try to clog the network but people who really wanted a tx confirmed would just pay a higher fee to be included. And because the fees change who ever is trying to spam the network would have to pay large amount of money. Eventually they would run out of bitcoin or lightning network would get developed and problem solved
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:21:10

How long did it take, and what fee did you pay if you don’t mind me asking
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:13:46
I’d argue that. Until bitcoin has lightning that works and an GUI that is user friendly so your grandma could use it other coins might work better in the interim. Until snore signatures, zk snarks is implemented to improve privacy, monero or other privacy coins might fare better. And platforms like neo, eos and stellar can do things bitcoin was just not ment to do. 
Plus you get the gains alts have shown during this last run make it desirable to try to diversify to get quicker returns, although this requires setting sell points and being able to get in and out of markets quick, or at least sticking to pre thought out plans. 
Example I bought verge (super shit coin I know) at 100 sats. It went to 2000 sats in less then 2 weeks. I sold at 1200, 1600 on the way up and 1900 on the way down. Those gains eclipsed my btc gains (got in at 3400 usd). If I had bought 1 bitcoin worth of verge, and sold at all time highs, I would have made 200 bitcoins (if my math is correct. And that’s insane.
Also an important factor to glean off this is that trades like my verge trade netted me considerable bitcoin gains (my main goal in trading) by diversifying jnto alts, you can grow your bitcoin stack tremendously, which is a huge benefit. If you just buy a bitcoin and hodl, the only thing at will change is your usd comparative. But by diversifying you can grow your bitcoin stack, which I believe is the most important thing.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:59:16
Larry can just buy the bitcoin. He can access it literally anywhere in the world with internet access on any device , exchange or cold wallet. 
If he is smart He can memorize 24 words and be anywhere in the world and use any ledger on any computer. 
If he’s a technical genius he can get access with no internet and a cv radio (I’m assuming he’s not since your asking a question for him about a very essential aspect of bitcoin)
The whole point is that once your own your private keys, you own your bitcoin. 1st rule of bitcoin. Your keys, your coin. Not your keys, not your coin.

Oh Definatly. To see mass adoption we’ll have to continue to scale with 2 and 3 layer solutions.

I’m a big fan of diversifying. Yeah I won’t 2000x on one coin and be a millionaire, but by making smart picks you lower your risk by spreading it around. By internet bubble analogy, Sure I might be picking some askjeeves and pets.coms, but by having a couple options I hopefully should also pick some googles and apples. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:09:07
I use to be a bitcoin maximalist, however my opinion has changed slightly. There are going to be millions of coins in 10+ years I think. Coins will cover specific niches, and it will be a long time before bitcoin can even do something as simple as privacy for example, so in the meantime coins like monero will fill the void. 
While yes last years bull run was an orgy of greed and speculation, I do believe there will be and was coins that were created that have interesting designs and architectures. Will any replace bitcoin? I highly doubt it. Right now what bitcoin does nothing else can compete with (decentralized global immutable secure p2p permissions less store of value, and sometimes cheap and fast transactions) and as it ages more features will be enabled on top of it. I cannot stress enough that I believe bitcoin will be the dominant crypto going into the future, and the means by which we judge all altcoins for the foreseeable future. However, bitcoin just isn’t designed to do why altcoins can be designed for. And that’s a good thing. 
And yes while some stocks went to zero (something very rare in the crypto space (even bitconnect still gets pumped). I do believe some alt coins will reach and exceed their ath though. Smart investors will see the niche environments coins will start to fill and be happy to speculate. I mean Big vc firms literally make their money investing in 9 projects that fail just to find that 1 that brings in 10000x returns. I’m willing to take those risks to bring in the greatest rewards. The key here is to allocate the portion of your portfolio that allows for the risk you want. Hence why 10-20% of my portfolio is  high risk alts. 
And you say maybe they will put their money into btc and another high valued asset. 2 years ago some people would have said etherium was a trash project. But the innovative investors who took that risk cause they could see what it became made insane returns. 
The thing is we never know what could be a world changing tech until it is. But by doing research and a bit of luck you can  position yourself to possible grow in ways that only buying bitcoin couldn’t. 
As for my verge trade, it was a total risk. At the time wraith protocol was on its way, and the cheap hot alts buy /pump trend hadn’t started yet. Will it every reach ath again? Maybe, maybe not. But I do know that even if it goes to 0 tomarrow (and for the record it’s still around 300 sats so I’m still up 3x my initial investment and have time to pull out  and still be ahead of my initial 100 sat investment price if something negative happens (like they turn out to be frauds or take the money and exit scam) I still made satoshis and grew my bitcoin stack cause I took a calculated risk, paid attention to the market and stuck to my plan. The whole point of this type of speculating/trading/investment only works if you go into this thinking you already lost your money. 
Long story short though, it’s not just greed and speculation with alts. Some of these alt coins will be googles and amazons, and positively impact the world, of that I’m very certain. And because of that certainty, I think it’s smart to diversify a small part of my portfolio to high risk coins that can generate high gains.

That’s two months of revenue I’d be missing out on, and I’m not exactly rich, so that’s money I could use now to feed my family and buy more bitcoin. And who knows? Today might have been the last day ever you could get sub 10k bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:59:16
First off welcome! 
I got into bitcoin to make money in September of last year before the bull run (3500 btc) I made some money on the run up to 20k, but I stayed for the tech. 
A risky way to get more bitcoin is to allocate a small percentage of your currant btc (example putting .1 of every full bitcoin )  into altcoins trading. If your smart and lucky you can grow your bitcoin stack greatly doing this correctly. 
Also one of the best ways to make bitcoin is to accept bitcoin for goods and services you make or do. If you mow lawns try seeing if people will pay you in crypto. Wash cars, baby sit, make 3d printed toys or parts, offer cloud storage or database management, hell even a lemonade stand, whatever you do. 
One of the smartest things I’ve ever herd is how much of my wealth should I invest in bitcoin? The answer was to invest as much as you know. 
Investing knowledge in bitcoin is the best investment you will ever make. It’s a steep learning curve but well worth it. 
To learn more listen and read the stuff andreaous antonopolous. His entire works are pretty much online for free on YouTube and around he web. Although I would recommend paying 20 bucks for his books (as I believe he is worth supporting) the internet of money volumes 1-2, as I believe it’s super well worth the price. 
Now that you have bitcoin start thinking about how you wanna store it. The first rule of bitcoin is your keys your bitcoin, not your keys not your bitcoin. Learn about storage from exchange hot wallets to hardware wallets and cold storage.
And don’t be discouraged! I got jnto bitcoin and quite my day job to spend 14 hours a day for 6 months learning about bitcoin (bitcoin payed for me not to work cause it went on such a huge bullrun so quick I got lucky) however I didn’t go back to work cause I learned everything there was to know about it. Some of the smartest people in the world have spent years learning about bitcoin and still to this day are learning something new everyday. This space changes so quickly and requires constant learning. But in my opinion it is well worth it. 
It’s hard but don’t get discouraged. Everything worth it in life is hard and takes time to understand.

That’s fine. They can’t continually dump btc though, with a finite supply eventually they will try to dump a bunch and it will be eaten up. Uneducated guy here though so I’m probably wrong. But the only people who will suffer are the idiots with weak hands
@_date: 2018-07-22 23:22:18
Yeah it’s huge. Even artwork about crypto is booming 
@_date: 2018-07-18 01:19:33
Well my favorite things to do is do a 50 50. If you think it’s gonna go up buy half what you want now, and that should satisfy your feelings of fomo, but you’ll still have cash on hand in case it drops more. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:50:58
FUD. Mt gox can’t forever crash btc. And people forget they are selling them to buyers who know that any price they buy them is pennies compared to future value 
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:14:18
I turned $100 into 1 .5 btc. I’ll tell ya how I did so for 50 doge. Pm me if interested
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:57:56
Correct 
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:56:46
You can buy a pizza today from some places for the equivalent of 10-20 usd. 9 years ago it cost 10000 bitcoins for that same pizza. 
See where I’m going? If you wait another ten years the bitcoin you have will be worth more, and you will have to spend less precious bitcoin
That being said if you have have a chance to change your life today for the better because of bitcoin take it. 
However that saying usually goes for when bitcoins up spectacularly. We haven’t even started going up, I’d hold a year and keep paying your mortgage if you can afford to
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:06:04
You can ban yourself from bitcoin, but you can’t ban bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:41:47
Exactly. I only use it for my super long term coldest of cold storage. But eventually it will become so easy to setup and use I believe a lot of people will do similar
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:33:39
Have you tried local bitcoins? Or bitcoin atms?
@_date: 2019-05-03 01:02:58

For those wondering I’m just looking to get a couple alts for cheap now. I have full faith binance will reopen and be just as useful as before

I mean if we don’t revisit 4K I bought as much as I could afford to during the last couple months so I don’t have any regrets at least. But if I could get one more big position I’d be very happy
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:36:38
I’m hoping 4 something so I can accumulate more before it goes to the moon and we never see 3-4K again
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:41:03
Haha yeah I didn’t get into it until 2017 in September. Fucking crazy time to be in the space
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:53:31
Coinbase pro
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:31:55
No one except merchants will use this. And even then probably not, I imagine point of sale machines would be more likely to run full nodes. So maybe good for mobile stores , but even then I find it hard to believe. 
Love bitcoin and anything that helps push adoption helps but I don’t see any real users buying this for this feature. But I can wait to see what projects like this will lead to eventually
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:10:11
Thanks for the for the reminder of the importance of good security

Well lighting is 2nd layer and what I was referring to
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:57:28
Congrats. I would have kept a couple bitcoin though lol, especially after having it that long I’d have kept a couple wallets no one knows about
And why did you sell on coinbase? You must have paid a ton in fees. Should have used coinbase pro, they would have only taken 400 bucks
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:53:12
I’m thinking 75k this time. We need lightning adoption above 40% I think to really see 100k
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:04:48
That is true. But your paying a premium to avoid kyc and aml. Nothing in life is free. All just depends on what works for you.
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:24:56
Main chain? Or lighting network
@_date: 2018-12-24 05:15:47
Everyone keeps saying bull trap. I’m torn. Wanna accumulate more. But also could use a 50k bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:26:19
I’m down with it

I’ll spend my bitcoin. We’re only a few years away from being able to buy anything with it. And when it gets to that point bitcoin is gonna be worth a lot
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:01:38
You should store your crypto in a hardware wallet, first rule of bitcoin is not your keys not your coins. 
Also when you buy use coinbase pro. Fees are sooooooooooo much cheaper
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:52:18
Yeah simple as this. Loaf of bread? 200 sats. House? 4 bitcoin. Coffee? 500 sats. Car? 50 million sats. Easy as pie
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:53:55
Forgot about all the forks yeah your right
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:40:36
Thanks that’s good to know. Always smart to have a stash of bitcoin that’s not kyc and aml
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:22:15
1. Andreas talks about this. If your capable you can use smoke signals to do a transaction. There’s a million ways with no internet connectivity from sms to mesh networks. 
2. In 5-10 years everything will require electricity. And I’d dare say the places that lack electricity will be hard to find as technology advances. Plus have you not herd of visa and MasterCard servers not having electricity? Paper fiat is the only system that doesn’t need electricity, although in reality it still does. 
3.lightning network (and banks charge fees as well, at least my fee is a choice and set by market forces )
4.lightning network. Adoption will increase and will become easier to do. 
5. (You made 2 # 4s) not true. Banks get hacked all the time. And stolen identity/credit fraud happens all the time. 
6. Yeah you get a hotline. But you don’t actually control your money. I’m willing to trade convenience for freedom.
Also worth noting that unlike fiat my bitcoin is censorship resistant, global, 24-7-365. Good luck trying to send fiat to someone’s 2 am that the government declares a terrorist in another country around the world.

@_date: 2019-05-13 17:05:29
That’s cause your going through an institution that requires that. If you buy crypto from a million other sources you won’t have to. And these institutions are just with as while we do this infrastructure inversion. Institutions are just using a skeuomorphic system because they can’t invision a world without kyc and aml
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:25:22

Set inflation rate,
Censorship resistant,
Doesn’t require user to identify themself (don’t even have to be human) ,
Hard to strong arm rob
Not transportation fees ,
Works 24-7-365,
Global ,
Faster transfer,
There’s more but those are my favorite

Well guess bitcoins dead. Everyone time to go home, the bank guys said bitcoins dead!

Yeah but he’s willing to pay the cost because of his kyc concerns. So an atm is his best option
I don’t blame him. I hate the kyc aml bullshit. For every 100 I buy from Coinbase I buy 25 from random bitcoin atms
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:52:38
Also sign up for coinbase pro. Fees are like 80% cheaper
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:06:25
It’s worth 1 bitcoin

Use Gdax /Coinbase Pro. Usually with a 100 dollar purchase on Coinbase you pay 3-5$, if you just put usd in your coin base and then transfer it to gdax(for free) and then buy the 100$ you’ll pay 10-20 CENTS. I realized this after hundreds of dollars to Coinbase for fees. 
I know it sounds like a lot, but I can buy bitcoin or any other asset they offer instantly and cheaply in 2 minutes
All that said because of this post I will defiantly try out square

That’s the thing. It’s not a company. It’s an option people can chose to use for whatever reason they want. 
You may not need it now. But one day every currency inflates to nothing. Literally has happened to almost every currency in existence.

@_date: 2018-12-22 05:26:25
It’s not stored on the internet. If your private seed words are never exposed to the internet, [this](  shows the odds of them randomly guessing your keys.
How safe is the ledger? There’s various opinions, but some of the smartest people out there use ledgers or trezors (with multi sig) to store millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. It is a million times safer (from the perspective of hacks or theft) for the average joe to use and store crypto then with a hardware wallet then to trust to an exchange or 3rd party, and paper wallets can be sketch since you have to enter the keys on a screen which could be recording your monitor. The ledger signs transactions on the device itself which prevents the keys from being exposed.
At least that is my belief, I am by no means an expert. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:28:24
Uhhhh Bart market? 
Idk. Bear market means more accumulation for me. Bull means I quite my day job and start days trading again lol
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:28:50
I’m sure it’s gonna be glitchy with everyone starting to fomo back in. At the peak of 2017 every exchange was swamped and performance on all sites was trash.
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:06:07
It’s popular with learned users. Even after studying bitcoin for a year I only have it used for a couple of my wallets. Also ease of use is still kinda complicated for the average joe. But as new wallets come out that make it easier to use I think we’ll see it used more often
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:06:36
Yes it’s owned by the same company. And I understand you don’t want to spend more on the hardware wallet then your btc. But at least store your crypto in a wallet where you hold the keys. Tons of good free apps for that like trust wallet, Jaxx liberty, mycelium and  electronium wallet are all good Mobil apps
