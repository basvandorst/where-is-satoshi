Yes.

I don't know about the article, or much about bitcoin, but this outlet shouldn't be called a newspaper. It is renowned for exaggerating and is very politically biased (ie it will have no qualms about fabricating a story to suit its own ends).  
In other words, get another source on the story before taking it too seriously.

I'm not Chinese but I will have a go:  
Bicoi go a moo!

I think people downvoted you because they disagree.   
 I just wanted to let you know that your comment made me think, and added to the conversation - even if I am not sure if I agree.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:00:08
Good point well made. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:32:26
It should at least put the name of the xposter.

I wonder if anyone can guess the first word I ever put into Yahoo's search bar?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:11:09
Oh it's you again! You stalking me?
This item has not been posted in this Subreddit, get your facts right.
Or - as I told you last time - downvote and move on!
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:53:54
I think I worded that slightly incorrectly.. 
I can't help thinking that by spending some I will be helping to strengthen it and increase confidence.

I think there is more dip to come. Especially tomorrow. After that I think it will climb again - I, for one will be looking for it to go lower on Mon/Tue and then grab a slice.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:54:40
Totally with you. I was very interested when I saw the title, a lot less so when I read it.

Please don't take this as a recommendation, but it was certainly quick and easy for me; I bought a relatively small amount very quickly from: 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:51:16
Approx. $6m surely?

Man I feel so much sympathy for your family and school friends.

3 days ago or something it was all like: "Yay! $1000 dollar mark broken!" Now it's: "Oh No!! we have gone below $1000!"

It's literally the charts that I have difficulty in comprehending. They look interesting but I don't know enough about them.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:36:48
Was a good time to grab - 1111.11!
I kind of get the top chart - until I zoom in and then there are weird green/red ghosts on the current value line - but the bottom chart makes no sense to me - neither do the grey bars in the top chart.

This is my problem with Bitcoin at the moment, I have so much confidence in it that I don't want to spend any - yet I know I should.
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate that confidence may not pull through, but if not, at least I am supporting the concept.

Wonder how you got your name?
You really need to take another look at what you just typed.
Reddit is about community. Imagine other scenarios - I don't know, let's say a bird spotting club... "Does anyone know a good location for lesser spotted grebelwarts?"  "aah, fuck off! You don't know that? There are libraries out there with that information, You're stupid!".
I totally understand the search feature, but Reddit is often about conversation - Maybe you need to go hang out elsewhere - or downvote and move on?
Luckily, not everyone is on the same wavelength as you, and my question has been answered numerous times. I now know more than I did before - You got a problem with that?
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:02:31
Thank you. For some reason I am interested in charts and statistics, but I have no real reason to use them in my day to day life - besides, my intelligence and concentration levels leave a little to desire.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:07:35


When I hover the grey bars, they kind of highlight but don't "do anything"... Are there other charts that I can look at to see the contents of that grey bar - if that makes sense.. I would like to see how big those transactions are or how many there were etc.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:49:02
Oops, missed that one - I did look, honestly!
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:41:32
Thanks, that helps a lot.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:18:13
While you are asking...
Any idea why this peak at [21:00](
Or even better, how I would get to find that info out for myself?
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:41:35
My guess (read hope) is that a lot of retailers made a lot of money on Black Friday and they cashed in some of their loot, and why not.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:53:13
Firstly, I haven't posted this anywhere else until this post.  
Secondly, neither had anyone else.  
Thirdly, downvote and move on instead of being a dick with half an attitude.  
Fourth, if you must stay around, at least learn some Reddiquette.  
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:05:52
Thanks for taking the time out to explain.
