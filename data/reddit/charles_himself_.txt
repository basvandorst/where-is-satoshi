I hope yall got some gold calls too. Diversify! Honestly, Im so tired of BTC vs Gold. We are on the same fucking team.
Gold is BTC father.

I'm in flagstaff at NAU and would love to visit the Tempe operations. Perhaps a tour? Learn the real world side of things!

OP please fix potato quality. I want to show my GF who is also a teacher, and just as skeptic, but I think she would find this a bit harsh...

The day I heard him on JRE podcast, is the same day I invested 1200 dollars into BitCoin. It is going to change our world in the same way the internet did. BitCoin makes it too easy to not use it.

It's a fair example.

I want to use this as a currency. Not like stocks.

It'll be a year in June.
No more acne
I have a six pack with literally zero physical effort. (Trust me, you will never see me in a gym.)
Overall consistent ass kicking energy 7 days out of the week.
Life's good :)

What are the fees for using one of those ATMs? I would appreciate a range, plus a median if anyone knew.

Are you bulletproof?

This reminds me of bioshock!!!
WELCOME TO RAPTURE

I've integrated bitcoin into my DNA. Lol jk.
It's called Bulletproof diet. For some reason reddit really hates it and the guy behind it, Dave Asprey.
Honestly the guy is a genius. IMHO.

So they could have bought a hundred million a month for a year... the market cap was around 4 billion dollars. There's ways Im sure they could have done without splashing the boat. You need to get real.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:22:35
Hold, it’s literally working for 100 percent of the bitcoin population at this moment.
Even with stocks, the crash comes but if you -hold- then you will win with the key ingredients of Time and patience.
I once regretted not buying Tesla at 40, seeing it at 90 I thought, now it’s too hot. Again at 180, no way I can get in, and so the same story continued...
It’s now near 400....
Do your homework on how bitcoin can become the IPhone, meaning it’s so good why would I ever use android?
Things like that.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:03:47
Do you really think they would have bought a billion dollars worth all at one time? Cmon people think.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:32:15
I sorta get what you’re saying. Gold won’t ever stop being a solid asset, so you’ll always be able to buy bitcoin with Gold.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:01:11
You’re not wrong
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:52:44
They would have profited 30 billion dollars then...is that what you’re saying?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:51:03
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:30:53
A hundred million a month isn’t a pailful, so they still would have profited tens of billions of dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:32:24
Forever. Imagine you have a sandwich, you eat it, then it’s just gone.

Btw, the BTC community shouldn’t dislike gold. It’s literally the analogue version of bitcoin. If humans exist Gold will always be worth it’s weight so to speak.
Not to disrespect anyone here in this community, but it would be completely foolish to think there isn’t enough room for both Gold and Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:21:08
A valuation of 14 trillion dollars?
@_date: 2015-03-20 00:53:47
Everyone should add this to their watch list. Give Amazon a data spike on Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:24:07
Yes when considered a global currency it is feasible under those numbers.
