Late reply, but I'll go ahead anyway: people were, this subreddit is just so circlejerky that it's become hard to find level-headed discussions.

I don't think this is the time to convince him of anything related to Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:39:12
Nah, lol. Even if they managed to buy 100,000 coins, that would still only be 3 milllion profit, which is basically nothing considering how difficult it is to buy and sell such a large amount of coins in the current state of the market.

OKAY 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:47:30
While I agree with your point, the growth we saw in April was nothing like earlier, and there's a reason the talk of bubbles increased so drastically over the last week.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:32:45
You're one of those...
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:37:19
I can't help but think that if this is indeed a DDOS, it was intended to happen at the same time as MtGox went down, or at the very least when MtGox just went up again. It makes little sense do it now, when the price has already stabilized.

That's a problem. By the time their accounts are verified, Bitcoins might've hit a new high, and they will all conclude: This shit sucks, maybe if I was verified earlier I might've bought some, but now it's too late. 
And then they never look back. I mean, it's not like you hear about Bitcoins and then buy later that night when the idea is still hot in your head. You might have everything from five days to several weeks to cool off and then decide not to "risk" it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:22:20
Wait for MtGox to come back online. Then wait another ten hours or so, and you should have a vague indicator of where Bitcoin is going.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:11:38
The problems starts arising when you're not in the US, not in a country that's part of the EU and not in one of those random countries who seem to have it easy with buying Bitcoins just in general...

"Some people just want to watch the world burn."
I mean, these last hours have been pretty top notch if you consider it entertainment.

I know this probably will have no effect on you, as you are already aware of what I will say by the time you reach the full stop I will put at the end of this sentence in just a moment.
Don't. 
Thousands of others did the same, they might feel the same as you do; regret and helplessness. You really just need to forgive yourself, take whatever you can from this crazy ride you have experienced and bring it with you when you make new decisions. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:16:39
Darn, I don't have a smart phone...
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:14:50
That's how it is right now. Verification for various sites, queues are long, the entire process tedious and old-fashioned. This entire thing reminds me of the internet way back, not 2013.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:25:00
Because collectors are crazy people and they are willing to spend a lot of money on their collectible of choice. How does a stamp which originally was only worth 10 cent suddenly become worth hundreds of thousands of dollars today, for instance?
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:55:50
Yeah, it's just a joke.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:57:50
So glad MtGox takes days to verify your account and days to get an international wire from somewhere else than the US and the EU through!
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:50:52
Remember the meme posted merely three days ago, the matrix one?
"What if I told you bitcoins aren't going to crash?"
Remember the other meme with the guy sitting in front of a computer eventually turning into a skeleton because he was waiting for Bitcoins to crash?
Both of those were at, close to or over a hundred upvotes and had several comments approving of the message. No, when Bitcoins were doing well people got delusional.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:12:14
Well, I did the comment karma for bitcoins thing, and I couldn't even figure out whatever I was supposed to copy that was worth money. There are now 0.0037XXXX bitcoins floating around in the internet cosmos that will probably never see a day of use.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:03:04
Thanks for being the one sound guy I was looking for in this thread. This "Spartans... Hold!" thing is just stupid if you have enough Bitcoins to change your entire life.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:14:59
"Only", haha. It's funny to think that it's actually over $300.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:35:42
Not entirely sure of the phrasing, but it was one of those bitcoin circlejerk phrases "bitcoins can't crash", "last night doesn't matter" and so on.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:51:53
I make some sense of this, but really, it mostly becomes a confusing mess of words that I simply cannot put together. I downloaded Electrum or whatever it's called and try to do the ./ $ importprivkey XXXXXXXX (name) , to no success and just gave up after googling for a comphrensive guide (which does not exist apparently) after that. For Bitcoins to succeed, there has to be some easier way to do this.
