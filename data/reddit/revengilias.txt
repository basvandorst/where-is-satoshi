It's because this is borderline fud, when op is just a jerk off.

Bitcoin isn't meant for pizza. Sure it can be used for pizza, but if you buy bitcoin just so you can use bitcoin to buy pizza, I would actually ask what the fuck you are even doing?

No, seriously though. Go to moneymart and then use Western Union to send some cash to the pizza place and let me know how well that works out for you. Then come back and bitch about the inefficiency of what you were doing.

Yeah, right under where Satoshi wrote "I'm designing this for retail purposes, so that you can use it to buy pizza"

I'm glad knobs like you are getting frustrated with bitcoin. It's a public settlement system. Your fucking jerkoff pizza debt does not need to be settled with bitcoin. Use a credit card like a normal person.
If you want to send $10,000,000 from China to Ireland, then use bitcoin.
If you want an infallible public record of a specific transaction, then use bitcoin.
If you're intelligent enough to know how bitcoin works, then you're intelligent enough to know it's a goofy way to buy pizza.
What a shit post.

I had no idea this was even a thing... I've used bitcoin, dogecoin, litecoin to gamble, but I've never attempted to connect those addresses to a coin supplier, but I was thinking about it recently. I guess I'll make a new wallet address for that.

First off, we don't put money into a bank, we put *currency* into a bank. Secondly, that currency is only there as long as they're "too big to fail."

The FDIC is a joke with less than 1% of insure deposits on hand, and banks get taxpayer bailouts, that's not any kind of security I'm interested in.

Just had this happen to me, it returned my coins. My fee was too low.
