First off, I respect your opinion.  That being said, Satoshi's whitepaper describes "forking" as the mechanism we're supposed to use in order to make changes that don't have perfect consensus.  It's not pretty but it's working as intended.  While it may hold back all flavours of Bitcoin in the short run, in the long run it makes Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem stronger.  That's the point of this whole thing, remember?  To take back our money!

I'd say Maxwell is way more appropriate.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:57:59


Yeah, I'm pretty angry about this.  Coinbase should have had BCH available on their platform waaaay sooner.  At earliest, a few weeks after the fork so people could sell if they wanted.  At absolute latest, a few hours after segwit2x was canceled.


Miners are supposed to be greedy.  That's how we know we can trust them ;) 


Amen to that.  The good news is, their greed and deception in acquiring Bitcoin will be their downfall because as long as we're vigilant, there will never be more than 21 million coins.  They can't steal from us any longer.

@_date: 2017-02-15 01:05:14


Can you elaborate?  I'm by no means an expert but I was under the impression that bitcoin had seen a number of hard forks in the past to recover from exploits/bugs found.  Either way, why would a successful hard fork mean Bitcoin has failed?

The issue is, they believe they are actually Bitcoin and are therefore entitled to the name.  They think the Segwit upgrade was a departure from Satoshi's original whitepaper.
Me personally, I appreciate the overt confrontation.  At least you know where you stand.

Big blocker here.  I'd gladly pitch in some BCH for this.  This Tether issue effects the entire ecosystem and I'd love to help.

There's not a doubt in my mind that Bitcoin and it's proponents **were** independent thinkers but that immediately changed when the money started rolling in.  I knew people were malleable ... but fuck me.  I had no idea that some of the most idealistic and socially radical people could turn on a fucking dime the instant they saw green.
When I first read the whitepaper back in 2012 I knew the technology was sound.  I knew the only type of attack Bitcoin was susceptible to was social in nature.  The part I didn't expect though was how inexpensive that attack would need to be.
*"Oh you don't need to fight them.  You just need to convince the pitchfork people that the torch people want to take away their pitchforks"*
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:01:06
Holy shit.  This is incredible!  Do you have any plans to support BCH?  The crypto space has needed this for so long!
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:03:06
It's silly to argue that changing paths now is a bad idea only because so much work went into getting us where we are now. Isn't that called the sunk cost fallacy?
Furthermore, if the devs hadn't dismissed the concerns of an enormous portion of the Bitcoin ecosystem, their work wouldn't have been wasted in the first place.
Regardless of what happened in the past, everyone wants Bitcoin to succeed. Let's start now building a compromise that doesn't alienate big blockers / miners. Core still has tons of leverage and big blockers /miners would be satisfied with only a modest blocksize increase.
Forget about the past. Let's move forward.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:12:38
A lot of people are feeling abandoned and betrayed.  You became a hero to some of us because you helped us understand Bitcoin's potential to shed light on some of the darkest parts of our society.  The attacks against you are unfair.  You've done more for Bitcoin than most of us combined.  
That being said, it's easy to see why people are so hurt. 
 Regardless of the validity of the ideas being suppressed, your refusal to call out those responsible for silencing legitimate discussion is being seen as an endorsement of that suppression.  You of all people should understand that if we can't talk about Bitcoin's problems, it's doomed to fail. I will continue to fight for Bitcoin and I hold out hope that you will too.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:49:03
Because it's the only good news at the moment and it's a great distraction from the giant elephant in the room.
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:16:03
I wasn't aware of this.  Although I've never seen it, I do believe you.  If you're willing to supply links or sources, I'll use them next time (and every time) someone claims otherwise.
Also, I don't think there's anything to be gained by anyone by "increasing the drama".  I think it's more likely that there is a genuine lack of understanding of the facts.  I'm open to hearing how I'm wrong about that though.
Either way, trust me when I say that both camps continue to look to you as a positive and influential voice in the community.  You might be one of the few people in the world capable of helping both subs overcome the attacks on open communication they've been facing.  I'm working with some people who've got great ideas on how to do this.  Send me a PM if you're interested in hearing more.

This response is everything that's wrong with the Bitcoin community. Put forth just a tiny bit of effort when talking shit about a deeply established business.  There are many bad words that can be used to describe Coinbase. Scam is not one of them. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:34:30
I should have been a bit more diplomatic in my response.  Sorry for that.  I think my point stands though.  Scam is not the right word to describe Coinbase.  How about unchecked oligopolistic exchange with piss poor customer service?  Can we agree on that?

Doesn't the action of tumbling require additional transactions which necessarily makes the capital gains short term?
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:54:53
It drastically depends on the level of Bitcoin activity in the area.  In most places I would expect the number of face-to-face sellers to be pretty strongly anti-correlated with Bitcoin ATM markups.  So if you have a lot of face-to-face sellers, you'd likely have cheaper Bitcoin ATMs.  That's just a hunch though.

I almost built something very similar last year. I used to have chicken in my backyard. In the summer it gets incredibly hot. I thought it would be neat to set up a webcam and allow people to shoot a water gun at them for Bitcoin.
You could also do something like "feed the puppies at your local animal shelter.

If you want to buy Bitcoin but the exchanges are making it too difficult, bypass them.
Step 1: Withdraw money from a cash machine in your local currency.
Step 2: Find a local seller using localbitcoins.com or Mycelium Local Trader (feature of the Mycelium wallet mobile app)
Step 3: Meet in person to make the trade.
Here's some friendly advice.  If you plan on buying a lot, split it up into multiple meetings and spread them out over a few days if necessary.  It's unwise to tell agree to meet up with a total stranger carrying large quantities of cash.  Spreading a $1000 buy into five $200 buys reduces both parties incentives to cheat.  It also reduces tension and more than likely leads to more pleasant and safer meetings.

Clone them all with the dd tool for Linux. Then mount them individually and perform a low level scrape of the filesystem to find it. Deleted or not, it might still be there.
