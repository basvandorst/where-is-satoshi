Yes, segwit is an increase. What don't people understand about that? Segwit could be implemented with a 1MB cap, but it wasn't, because it created an opportunity do do a block size increase with a soft fork. As soon as segwit starts getting some use, miners can start making blocks that are larger than 1MB. Many people have estimated that blocks will be averaging about 1.8MB once segwit is active.
Now maybe you are unhappy with 1.8MB, but if you say that segwith is not a blocksize increase, you are saying something that is easily shown to be false.

It would be nice if you could optionally import a long hexadecimal sequence with no checksum. I'd like to roll a 16 sided die to create the master key, because that way I know the randomness is good, and I can input the same see to two computers and confirm that they generate the same addresses.
Right now I do the following:
1. Roll dice
2. Use bitcoin-bash-tools to convert die rolls to WIF and addresses
3. Use bitaddress.org to double check that WIF was calculated correctly from the die rolls
4. Use Bitcoin Core to double check that address was calculated correctly from WIF
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:25:22
Oh hell no. Bitaddress is used on an offline, air-gapped machine in an vacuum-walled Faraday cage. Kidding about the cage, but I would never connect to any network with a computer that knew my private keys.
But this is more than about creating high quality entropy. I'm confident that Core's entropy source is perfectly fine. This is about *personally* creating the entropy, which provides not just confidence, but *certainty* about that critical link in the chain. Throwing dice is quite cheap, so why not?
This is also about enabling multiple independent verification. Even if all of the pieces of software above were written by hackers trying to steal my bitcoins, they would all have to collaborate to do it. In the case of bitcoin-bash-tools, they would have to make sure to put a back door in my copy of Linux, and I could just hang onto some raspberry pi from 2013 with my copy of bitcoin-bash-tools and use that as my double checker indefinitely, meaning whatever attack "they" want to do they had better already have done it.
So to me, this is the ultimate method of doing cold storage, and I can't think of why I would settle for anything less.

The issue is that miners can cheat by creating blocks that contain zero transaction fees. They can still get paid under the table, but they do not have to send any money to a sync flag. Because of this, sync flags are not funded and not worth mining.

I don't know enough to disagree properly, but I keep seeing a hole in the way you are phrasing your comment. Is it possible that MW has smaller data requirements than CT, by virtue of the fact that participants need not interact to merge?
i.e. you could say MW has larger requirements than CT for a given transaction, but be leaving out the fact that highly efficient transactions with multiple non-interacting groups are feasible in MW but not in CT?
If you can get 10000 effective transactions merged into a MW block, and you would need 100 separate CTs because of the logistics of getting everyone to cooperate, doesn't that mean MW uses less data in practice?
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:16:35


Does this mean that you need your wallet.dat file with all of your bitcoins to be sitting on a networked computer? That seems kind of bad... you can import a watch-only address I guess but that seems like a bad workflow.
Does 0.13 support import of master public key for a watch-only HD wallet? That would make it practical to use bitcoin core to validate cold wallet funds.

This weekend I want to think a little bit about maybe saying that sync flags have to get paid with a fixed fee, and then the fee gets targeted based on how long sync flags are taking to produce. (i.e set sync flags to have equal difficulty to blocks, and then if they are being produced more rapidly than blocks you lower the fixed fee by a percentage, and if they are being produced more slowly than blocks you raise the fixed fee.)
This might need to relax that "no progression" rule, replacing it with two parallel blockchains that tend to be similar in length based on this fee feedback loop.
@_date: 2016-08-22 15:59:19


Last I heard, this was not true -- version 0.13 implements HD keys (BIP-32) but does not implement a 12-word mnemonic (e.g. BIP-39). 
Also, version 0.13 does not support export/import of the master key, so you are still going to need to rely on a backed up copy of wallet.dat to recover your coins.
Great release though. 0.13 contains some major improvements!

There is some concern that if people have this option, they will use it rather than conscientiously backing up their wallet.dat. Then if wallet.dat is lost, they lose important transaction metadata would could, for example, damage their privacy.
That argument should also apply to deterministic key generation though -- after all, metadata is created when you make transactions, so you should be backing up your wallet.dat regularly anyway, so what's wrong with key pools?
This argument stems from the "make it impossible to use wrong" school of thought. I think it strikes the wrong balance. If people find using the Core wallet too awkward, then they will just go use some other wallet.
All wallets should support backing up the bitcoins with a passphrase. Sure, the metadata may be lost if you get lazy about backing up your wallet.dat. I'd much rather lose my metadata if I get lazy (or my flash drives fail, or are destroyed in a fire) than lose my bitcoins!!!
Anyway, in case there is a fire that wipes out my electronic media, I can always emulate the current core functionality and preserve my privacy by destroying my passphrase. ;-)

I see KeepKey is down to $89. That's a huge drop in price! Hope they are able to stay in business, because it looks like a great product.
For me, the ideal hardware wallet would:
1. look like KeepKey
2. let you enter 64 dice rolls (while it's not plugged in naturally) as the master seed
3. hand the xpub to the wallet on the computer, which could monitor generated addresses to provide an independent check to confirm they are derived from the master seed
You could verify the xpub was generated properly with a separate piece of offline hardware if you were a paranoid freak. A malicious hw wallet could still stab you in the back if you didn't use multisig, but that will always be true, and the above should protect from any hardware/firmware failures.

In this scheme, it is not necessary to mine the previous block hash.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:43:51
I'm thinking my proposal crashes and burns because of the dynamic describes here. Miners can offer to put your transaction in a block at a discounted rate if you pay them under the table, and thereby avoid sharing fees. I keep forgetting about that.
@_date: 2016-04-24 01:19:41
I really like the dash idea.
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:17:06
I have no problem in principle with reducing the block interval down from 10 minutes, but at some point you run into a problem. If you reduce the block interval to 1 second, for example, then whoever finds the next block has a massive head start on finding the subsequent block while the solved block propagates to the other miners.
So there is some lower boundary that it is not safe to go below. But this method allows you to cut that safe lower boundary (whatever it is) in half. As you pointed out, it does increase complexity, which is bad but maybe not very bad.
@_date: 2016-04-22 21:42:20
That is a problem. The clumsy solution would be to avoid if possible, but make multiple transactions when necessary.
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:02:17
Maybe the way it works, is you request incoming transactions are on the phase you prefer, based on the fee market per phase?
@_date: 2016-04-25 21:44:08
Actually, nothing says the two phases must use the same hash algo. In fact, one of the phases could even be proof of stake.
@_date: 2016-04-25 19:03:29


Mining more blocks improves decentralization by reducing the advantage large pools have. Solo miners have to wait half as long before mining a block.


If you key off of the txid, an attacker could form two different transactions that spend the same output, and both transactions could be mined on the two different phases. This would cause a double spend to receive 1 confirmation. The double spend would then cause the chain to be invalid, so the miners would lose revenue, which could open up additional attack vectors against the miners.


The chain cannot progress until both phases get mined, but it seems clear that the hashpower would concentrate on the more profitable phase first. Other effects make this more complex -- for example miners may not all receive the most profitable phase simultaneously, and which phase is the most profitable may change from moment to moment as transactions enter the mempool.
Is this a problem? It looks pretty gnarly, but hard to say for sure it's a problem.

No, this idea doesn't involve modifying the block size. For example, if you want 1 MB blocks, then you could mine 2 500 KB phases every 10 minutes.

What do you think of incorporating the occasional Proof of Stake block to publish transactions that are being censored by the miners?
(Or to discourage censorship in the first place by ensuring that it cannot achieve the desired effect.)

@_date: 2016-04-22 13:48:04
Ah, indeed you did! Yes, I think it could help deter transaction censorship.
I was considering something else last night -- a half baked idea but maybe interesting -- to say that perhaps effective block interval could be reduced and decentralization could be improved if blocks could be split into phases and outputs could only be spent in one of the phases.
For example, imagine a block at height 10. Rather than mine the whole block at once, we mine it in 3 phases. Call these 10-A, 10-B and 10-C.
Outputs are tagged when they are created as A, B or C outputs. "A" outputs can only be used in phase A and so forth.
In this way, the miner who is mining block 10-B does not need to possess block 10-A. They can begin mining as soon as they receive block 9-B. To fasten the three chains together, the miner of 10-B would also commit to 9-A and 8-C.
Perhaps a scheme like this could enable increasing the rate of discrete mining events while preventing "progress" caused by an unhealthy ratio between transmission time and propagation time.

The comparison is not simple. MW, as I understand it, permits transactions to be merged by third parties, maybe resulting in much less witness data to accomplish the same set of value transfers? Also, CW does not permit validation after pruning, but MW does, which means that the blockchain grows much slower, or could even shrink.

An important property preserved by my formulation is that all of the hashpower validates both shards. This is not primarily aimed at improving scalability, just safely increasing the number of independent mining events.
Typically sharding aims at scalability and implies that miners do not validate all shards.
Also, I would argue that it is important to be able to move coins between shards, to prevent the development of an unbalanced fee market between shards.

I think one great part of this is that a malicious manufacturer would provide plenty of proof of their crime. The hardware could be examined, and the back door could be pointed out. The back door could be discovered before any coins were even stolen.
This is significantly different from the Casascius model.
However, counterfeit open dimes are a potential weakness. I'd like to see someone use a signed un-reproducible process to deter counterfeiting. For example, the [shattered glass wallet]( has the manufacturer snap a picture of an un-reproducible artifact, create a fingerprint from the picture, and sign the fingerprint. This physical artifact cannot then be counterfeited.

Increasing the blocksize makes it more expensive to run a full node, and we depend on lots of people to run full nodes to keep the miners behaving properly. Increasing blocksize makes it easier to identify and penalize full node users. Also, we have other options for reducing fees. (batching, lightning, off chain tx) Also, high fees are important for a sustainable system over the next 20 years as the block reward gets cut over and over.

I disagree. The whitepaper appears to suggest that participants would resolve disputes about consensus upgrades by voting with their hash power. I think Satoshi (like Gavin) assumed that it was economically impossible for a minority fork to exist for more than a few blocks.

Lol "When SegWit was activated, it caused [us to] hard fork"
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:10:17


The whitepaper appears to touch on exactly this topic:
*"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."*
*"They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."*




Not so. What Satoshi is writing, as I interpret it, is that "Proof of Work solves the problem of what rules should be added to the protocol, because with the Proof of Work rule in place, branches that apply rules that the majority disagrees with will quickly be abandoned by profit-seeking miners and stop growing."
Clearly Satoshi was wrong about this. Minority hashpower chains do not get quickly abandoned, because they can apply a new retarget algorithm and become equally profitable to mine as the majority hashpower chain.

Bravo for changing your mind. Quite rare on the internet!
Even though the whitepaper was an amazing achievement, Satoshi didn't know everything that we have now learned about building a currency with a blockchain.
Similarly, even though they invented the first real airplane, the Wright brothers did not know everything there is to know about how to design an airplane.
It doesn't make any sense to evaluate an improvement to an airplane by asking whether or not it matches the design of the Wright Flyer, and it likewise doesn't make sense to reject a change to Bitcoin *on the basis* that it doesn't match the system described in the whitepaper.
However, if one is going to **make** that mistake, and stick to the whitepaper, one must admit that the Whitepaper implies that 'validity' is defined as 'the rules on whatever chain the majority hashpower chooses to extend' and that the chain with the most work is always the true Bitcoin, and that therefore Bitcoin Cash is an alt coin.

And if you do something about it, 99 times out of hundred it comes back to bite you.

I don't think so. I'm not sure exactly sure what is the motivation behind your suggestion to make it the default to store 1 year and prune earlier. Maybe if you explain the reasoning behind doing that rather than for example pruning everything, then I could comment better on your suggestion.
I am not an expert in how this works, but my understanding about pruning is that it works as follows:
1. Download all block headers and fit them together into the chain
2. Download and validate blocks. You start with the genesis block and work forward. You build the UTXO database. As outputs are validly spent, then can be deleted from your computer
The normal pruning approach thus begins at the genesis block and works forward, validating blocks and updating the UTXO database along the way.
The approach I am advocating does not begin with the genesis block and work forward -- rather it begins with the most recent block and works backward. Rather than build your own UTXO database, you would request a copy from a peer. You would hash it and compare the hash to a hash the miner's added to the recent block. After verifying that you have the "official" UTXO database, you would validate blocks in reverse order. The advantage to doing it this way is that it is more important to validate recent blocks than it is to validate old blocks -- so we should prioritize the validation of recent blocks. Ideally, if your node ran for long enough, you would get all the way back to the genesis block, but as a practical matter if you validate all blocks in the previous year it is plenty good enough, because there is no chance that a 1 year reorg will ever be permitted to happen.

This scenario increases the value of bitcoin because:
1. You must pay mining fees to transfer ownership. That means you must go to an exchange and buy bitcoin.
2. You must hold (or burn) some quantity of bitcoin to manage the colored coins.
3. A system like this helps bitcoin be more widespread, which increases the perception that it will be around for a  long time. That makes it more attractive as a long term store of value, which leads to people buying more of it.

If you can build the database from the pruned blocks -- which I actually think you probably could, because the unspent parts of the merkle tree should be there -- then you're good to go. If you cannot, then perhaps at some point UTXO set commitment will be included in blocks, and those can be used to verify that a UTXO snapshot you got from a stranger is valid. Or at least that the miners accepted it a year ago.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:20:50

Utxo commitments. You have a full year of blocks, and you can request the utxo set at any point in time, and validate it by checking the hash in that block.

They can't pre-broadcast the transactions. Someone else might mine them and get the fees. So they have to broadcast a bunch of transactions with the block. That would be slow to propagate, and maybe another miner would be slow to build on it?

You could argue that the block size should be reduced to just the coinbase and one other transaction. Then my god! Think of how high the transaction fees would shoot up to! But transaction fees can only go as high as transactions are valuable, and transactions are only valuable insofar as the network is large.
Blocks should be as large as safety permits. If attackers spam the network, then transaction fees will rise as people try to rise above the spam. Which is what you wanted to achieve by constraining block size, only now the bonus is that spammers are wasting their money.
@_date: 2015-06-12 03:17:05
Cap size should not be a function of demand. Cap should be as high as safety permits. If 10MB is the highest safe cap, then we need to improve the tech to permit a higher cap. Fixed increase schemes don't make sense, and Bitcoin had better evolve to be able to safely fail to meet demand for on-main-chain transactions, because that demand could easily go sky high.

@_date: 2015-06-12 02:28:27
You need a couple more assumptions in order to make my statement work. First, let's say you need more than 50 transactions. Let's say you need something like a "typical" sized block. So let's say it's 2 years from now and blocks are typically 10mb.
Second, you need to assume that broadcasting whole transactions takes longer than broadcasting references to transactions already in the mempool. Like hashes of transactions or something.
With those two in place, you can see that there could be a substantial propagation penalty to stuffing blocks with transactions that no one else knows about. While they are waiting to receive and validate your weird block, someone else might solve the block with pre-broadcast transactions, and orphan your block.

The alternative to war is morality. That is to say we try to persuade each other that one answer is incorrect and try to come to consensus. My point was just that it might be nice to formalize (as a community) what we think would be a rational consensus building procedure, so that war can be avoided. "No change unless everyone agrees" is not realistic and instantly devolves to the prioritization of some people's opinions over other people's. Best if that priority process is out in the open for scrutiny.
Sure, war is always there as the last resort, but as Adam Back and others have observed, Bitcoin may be permanently damaged during a contentious fork.

I think this analysis approach is not valid. There is no clear connection between demand and safety. I don't think we have a real solid analysis framework for computing the maximum safe blocksize, but an example might go like this:
"Decentralized validation of the entire blockchain should be possible with a typical computer on a typical home internet connection. It should take less than than 10 days to complete, and cost less than $50 in data and energy expenses. From this, and based on current technology trends, we expect that this goal is met with a block size increase function of F()"
There are lots of rigorous formulations of the safety goal, based on your beliefs about the way the world is and preferences about how it should be. Plenty of debate to be had there. But the first consideration should be safety, not meeting demand.
Now you could have an adjustable anti-spam cap that is lower, and maybe that is what you are talking about.

You and I probably agree on almost everything, and I agree that the Bitlicense is probably a bad regulation that doesn't have moral authority. I disagree with the libertarian/anacap way of talking about these things though. I see it as an anti-thesis reaction to the statist thesis. Because it is a reaction, it is colored by the motivation to get away from statism, which makes it not a clean evaluation of reality. Consequently, it finds itself getting dragged back toward the statist position, and having to come up with clumsy rationalizations to avoid noticing what is happening.
The core supposed epiphany is that the State is a human institution like any other, and that it does not have any special prerogative that would enable it to justifiably initiate violence. I think that mental model is too simple to handle reality.
Anacaps want to say that it is always wrong to initiate violence, but then I ask them what should happen if someone steals their car. Should jackbooted thugs deprive the thief of liberty with their awful truncheons and pistols? How is that not the initiation of violence?
Well, naturally it is the thief who has initiated violence! By, um... getting in a car that the State says is yours and driving it without your permission. Not normally what one would recognize as violence. This is the kind of redefinition-as-required that hints that you are starting from a set of primitives that are not adequate.
So what if I drive drunk and I get home safely? No car crash, no victim, right? Or what if I do not have adequate safeguards of client funds, but nothing bad happens. No harm no foul, right?
Wrong! To expose a person to inappropriate (defined by who?) risk is to make them a victim! The concept of "victimhood" must be expanded, because it is held as a dogma that only victimization justifies interference from the jack-booted thugs.
What is happening here, as I see it, is a totally appropriate movement away from the libertarian anti-thesis toward synthesis with the statist position. But to save face words are getting re-defined so that people will hopefully not notice what is happening.
I just think that is lying to yourself to save the assumptions you would prefer to start with, and that is why I don't like the libertarian way of talking about things.
It would be better to frankly admit that the leviathan is here to stay because we need it, and we had better figure out how to have regulatory systems that improve over time, rather than shouting out the front door that the whole thing is illegitimate, while secretly letting it back in through the back door.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:02:17
I know it's a rhetorical question, but I'll bite. Generally speaking, the benefit you get out of regulation is that *other people* are forced to do things that they would prefer not to do, which creates options that did not previously exist, and enables certain productive configurations of human behavior which otherwise could not exist. Another way to say this is that now you have the opportunity to give your bitcoins to an exchange which is regulated by the bitlicense, which you previously did not have. Now whether that is worthwhile or not is a conversation worth having, but I think it's a little immature to pretend to not understand the value proposition that regulation theoretically offers.
Similarly, I might ask what good it does *me* that I am not permitted to rob a bank without men with guns coming for me. Of course it does not do me any good, but I consent to be regulated so that other people will also consent.

I actually think Gavin's approach is the right one. He seems to have gone about it by saying "what can a home internet connection comfortably support?" and then worked backward to determine a block size. Combine that with a growth factor based in the expected advance of technology. I don't know if his numbers are accurate or not, or what kind of safety factor he uses, but the approach seems right to me.
The only quibble I have with 's approach is that he does not factor in the bandwidth required to get the entire current blockchain. pounced on that right away, and I agree that it should be in the analysis.
Now there may be viable alternative instead of getting historical blocks via the peer to peer network. For example, they could be archived on blu-ray disks at libraries, or available through the mail from organizations that care about it.
Another approach, which does not come up for reasons I cannot guess, would be to have nodes simply go back to an old checkpoint and stop there. If the checkpoint were old enough (e.g. 5 years old) and if the node could verify that everyone has been mining on that chain for the last 5 years, then it seems effectively as good as going to the genesis block to me. UTXO commitments might help here. If you determined that there had been some hanky panky 5.5 years ago, and the whole world somehow didn't notice all this time, I don't see how anyone would say "oh boy, time to rewind 5.5 years." A node that goes back to genesis cannot provide any additional actionable information that a node that goes back 5 years cannot provide.
Relying on checkpoints in this way seems to me to be an effective way to mitigate the ever-growing-blockchain dynamic.
@_date: 2015-06-12 18:28:30
Yeah, I think we need a cap, because we need to avoid a situation where it costs $50,000 to validate the blockchain, so only a handful of independent actors in the world will do it. On the other hand, the proper cap is unrelated to demand. It is a very hard decision to make, and it may require a couple of failed attempts, but the right questions to ask are:
1. How expensive (max) should it be to fully validate the blockchain?
2. How can we increase capacity by making full validation cheaper (per transaction)?
There are a lot of unknowns, and  a lot of room for arguing still, but addressing those questions would help determine the proper cap-size-over-time function.
Also, I think Meni really nailed it when he focused on the "how do we handle demand that exceeds capacity" question. Gotta fix that no matter what, and "by bursting into flames" just isn't very professional.
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:49:31
AFAIK, the problem with getting pruned blocks from more than 1 year ago is that you cannot validate the blockchain by looking at pruned blocks. You need the original blocks. I don't know whether you can build a UTXO database from pruned blocks or not.
Now maybe validating the blockchain back to before a year is not an important goal -- and your suggestion is basically very similar to my suggestion regarding ancient blocks but just uses a different technique.

I would try to avoid making any statement like that, which would be a gross oversimplification. However, "external regulations" defined perhaps as "rules that pre-define how violence will be administered within a society" definitely help motivate businesses to put policies into place that will secure their customer funds. I think there are a lot of examples the bitcoin community could point to where a business lacked sufficient motivation to secure customer funds.
In some situations, businesses may find it impossible to secure customer funds, because the expense of doing so would put them at a competitive disadvantage and they would stop existing. In those cases, it is very helpful for the business to know that their competitors are forced to play by the same rules.
I'm not trying to defend the bitlicense, which could be a terrible set of regulations for all I know. I'm just trying to say that the attitude of "this regulation is stupid because it makes me pay money without giving me a reward" does not facilitate productive conversation or progress toward a world with healthy regulations rather than stifling or corrosive regulations.

Priority schemes should favor transactions that pay the most fees, but not all transactions are created equal. If miners want to keep bitcoin healthy, they will charge higher minimum fees for transactions that:
1. Consume more block space
2. Consume more mempool resources
3. Use young outputs
Personally, I don't think miners should ever accept transactions that do not pay a fee and I would be surprised if that practice does not end before long.
Miners are unfortunately in a bit of a weak negotiating position on fees until we start seeing full blocks because some other miner may defect and process transactions that are not paying sufficient fees. I think there is value in having the protocol suggest rational default minimum fees. Of course, it is up to each miner to decide in the end.

You could also favor pools that use getblocktemplate. Or minority pools. It doesn't necessarily need to be p2pool. It would be nice to have some way for ordinary users to promote certain pools though.
The downside would be that people would also be penalizing the teeny tiny pools that no one chooses to give any fees to. But maybe that is a tradeoff that is worth it. If we had 4 huge pools with 25% each, and they are all using getblocktemplate, and we have a way to threaten them by revoking fees, we may have the decentralization mostly fixed.

6-sided die rolls -&gt; You need 50 rolls
10-sided die rolls (my personal favorite) -&gt; You need 39 rolls
It is hard to produce a truly random string of characters. Use dice.
Bitcoin can use up to 160 bits of entropy, or 49 rolls of a 10 sided die.
I like a 10 sided die because you can easily produce very very random digits that way, and because it is easy to distinguish the symbols even with sloppy handwriting.

In my experience, people start saying "intrinsic value" when they want to assert that one kind of thing is different than another kind of thing, because the second kind of thing only has value given to it by an external "valuer" whereas the other has value because of its intrinsic properties, independently of anything external to itself. This particular distinction between things is absurd, because all value exists in the interaction between the particular properties of a thing, plus a living thing with thoughts and desires.
One might make useful distinctions without resorting to the muddy concept of "intrinsic value." For example, you might say that a particular thing is not essential for life, and you would be correct.
In the case of Bitcoin, I often hear people say that bitcoins do not have intrinsic value, unlike gold, which has intrinsic value. When pressed, they explain that gold can be turned into jewlery or electronics. Here, it turns out that what is mean is not that gold is essential for life, but rather that gold has uses that do not involve being a medium of exchange. If people would say "Bitcoin has no uses apart from its uses as money, but gold has uses apart from its uses as money" then they would be correct.

If people just use it to send USD, and they hold it for as little time as possible, then more of the 21 million BTC are "in play" and the total amount of money in transit will be represented by a larger number of BTC. (That is to say, the price will be low.) If people also use it to store their wealth, then the less of the 21 million BTC are "in play" and the total amount of money in transit will be represented by a smaller number of BTC. (That is to say, the price will be high.)

Good point. If you are ok with taxation, then you may very well accept taxation via inflation.
Then again, you might object to inflation because people are less able to comprehend it than regular taxation, or because the inflation level is set by a private organization (the fed) rather than by Congress, where the constitutional authority to tax resides. (Assuming you are in the USA as I am.)


I don't think that's right. The tax due to "artificial" capital gains applies equally to stocks, real estate, gold, bitcoin... anything that isn't the dollar. So it doesn't distinguish between uses of your money that stimulate the economy and uses of your money that do not.

An idea from for us non-miners. Set the mining fee to zero and just include a .0002 donation to P2Pool, or to the address of one of the other big pools.
Depending on who you donate to, you may have to wait longer for your transaction to get into a block, but at least you will not be supporting ghash.
Edit: I know this is an inconvenience and could make your transaction take a while to confirm. I'm not suggesting that you do it for all of your transactions. Just where you can tolerate the downside. This is a suggestion for people who want to do their little part, rather than just nag miners to give up profits.

It depends on your definition of speculation. I am defining speculation here as holding an asset for the purpose of making a profit. Demand for bitcoin as a "store of value" (to make it so that you do not have to purchase something the second you receive the funds) will still exist even when the price does not increase over time. By contrast, there is no motive to speculate if you do not expect the price to go up in the future.
Edit: Obviously if you use Bitcoin to store value, you are "speculating" that the amount of purchasing power will be equal or greater in the future to what it is today. The point is that this level of demand is sustainable, whereas speculative demand is unsustainable.

Let's take an example that I am a little more familiar with. 
In a Bitcoin transaction, there are only two parties, right? That's what I keep hearing. There is just the sender and the receiver. Except that that is not true at all. There are three parties: the sender, the receiver, and the generalized participant in the bitcoin economy. Everyone in the Bitcoin economy is affected in some small way by every transaction that takes place.
For a direct example, every time there is a transaction, everyone who runs a full node must validate the transaction and store it on their hard drive.
To handle the problems associated with the "commons", the Bitcoin protocol levies two taxes on users of the protocol. First, it charges a tax on wealth, by giving out new BTC to miners and thereby inflating the money supply. Second, it charges a tax on transactions.
Now if I do not like those taxes, I am free to not participate in the Bitcoin economy, but it would not make any sense to refer to them as "theft."

@_date: 2014-03-14 19:20:15


The argument is that people may object to taxation via inflation because they feel that taxation should be simple to understand. Saying that tax law is complicated does not address the argument.




Very well, it is a public-private hybrid. Congress has the authority to tax at the federal level, and it is important that taxation be supervised by elected officials that can be voted out of office. If they delegate the power to tax to the Federal Reserve, or to the CIA, or to the Post Office, or to the local Wal-Mart night manager, I think an argument can be made that the administration of taxation has been shifted to the wrong place. Apparently this is complicated by the fact that the Fed is not transparent, even to Congress, so it is not clear how they provide the necessary level of oversight.


The same tax would apply if I shifted my wealth to Euros, or any other fiat currency. So it apparently is not a penalty for keeping your money in a non-scarce item.

A single market advantage does not mean victory for the parasite currency. People may be adverse to storing their wealth in MoochCoin because the value is more volatile for example.

I am very skeptical of POS as well. However, the possibility of an alternative to burning energy is very compelling.
I have made the same argument you are making -- That POS fails because you can generate a counterfeit chain with the same genesis block. I think it is true that therefore checkpoints are required.
Perhaps it is sufficient to have just one checkpoint, which could be hard wired into the client. After this point, centralization would not be required.
For example, you could pick a block in the bitcoin blockchain and make that the "anchor" block for your POS coin. You could say that influence on the POS coin is proportionally allocated to private keys according to how much bitcoin they control at the time of that block.
Then you have a good decentralized starting point. An attacker would not be able to control a majority of these keys, and a counterfeit chain could thereby (handwave handwave) be distinguished from the chain that actually has the votes that can trace their lineage back to the bitcoin anchor block.

Here is a serious error:
You say that the only reason a person would purchase a bitcoin is if they thought someone else were going to buy it for a higher price from them.
This is not true, and it is the difference between bitcoin and a pyramid scheme. Bitcoin has other uses than just to make a profit off of a "greater fool".
1. You can purchase one with the expectation of *losing money* on the deal, if bitcoin allows you to transfer value across a distance, or between parties who do not trust each other, and it is the cheapest or most desirable method for you at the time.
2. You could purchase bitcoin with the expectation of it losing value relative to other goods, if you believed that your other currency options were going to inflate, or if you wanted the peculiar features of a bitcoin. (Easy to store and transport, incorruptible, immune to bank failure, un-confiscatable or whatever.)
3. You could purchase bitcoin to allow you to automate your business, so that you do not need so many employees. (Seems to have worked for 4. You could purchase bitcoin, or opt to be paid in bitcoin to allow you to get around currency exchange fees. E.g. you work at a bar in Germany. The bar takes bitcoin, and pays you in bitcoin, and you send it to your poor aunt in Botswana. Or you save it for your trip to San Francisco. Or to order stuff from the website that only takes USD and bitcoin. This gets more and more powerful the more widespread usage becomes.)
5. You could purchase bitcoin for ideological reasons. Many people hold bitcoin purely because they prefer holding bitcoin. They do not care about profit, they just don't want to participate in the dollar or whatever.

If transactions follow the Pareto rule, which they probably would, then 20% of the people will generate 80% of the transactions. Big transaction producers include exchanges like Bitstamp and payment processors like Bitpay. If these organizations decided to stop Ghash from getting any of their transaction fees by instead donating to several other big pools, it could have an impact. This gives these exchanges a way to throw their weight around, which is good for decentralizing control. Exchanges could let users opt in too. A broker like Coinbase could simply have a checkbox that says "Check here to stop Ghash from getting the transaction fee. Note: First confirmation could take several hours."

Hi Dad,
Just wanted to keep you posted on recent bitcoin news. A major trading site, mtgox.com shut down last night after halting withdrawals for the last two weeks. This does not affect bitcoin directly, but has dropped the price in the short term from $800 where you bought to about $500.
Nothing too surprising has happened, and long term prospects remain unchanged. This market is very volatile and we are still tracing out the aftermath of the December bubble pop. I expect we will resume exponential growth in the next couple of months, at which point speculators should start to pile in again.
A little background on mtgox. At this time last year they were the largest bitcoin exchange. Last April they got a lot of bad publicity when their servers were unable to handle high volumes, resulting in many people not being able to log in and do trades. This was the catalyst for the April 2013 bubble pop. A couple of weeks later they had $5 million seized by the US government because they failed to register as a money transmitter. Shortly after that they halted USD withdrawals, leading many to guess that they were insolvent. Somehow they managed to limp along until January, with huge delays on USD withdrawal. A lot of their customers left them for better-run exchanges, such as Bitstamp, or for brokerages such as Coinbase.
Recently, mtgox announced that they were halting bitcoin withdrawals. Apparently a bug in their accounting system resulted in automatically paying out bitcoins multiple times to the same withdrawal request. As a result they lost quite a bit of money, although they have not said how much. They should have noticed this problem quickly, however they seem to be pretty sloppy and it is possible that they were bleeding money for a while without noticing or reconciling their books.
So anyway you may hear news stories about mtgox's failure, or inaccurate stories that place the blame on bitcoin itself. The bitcoin protocol is doing fine, and there are many indications that there are more and more places to spend bitcoins worldwide, which is the most important predictor of success.

If you would define "intrinsic value" we would be able to have a productive debate. I don't mind if you want to copy and paste from your post history.

I know this is rank heresy, but hear me out:
The costs of securing the network fall eventually entirely on people transacting. People who save get a free ride. This doesn't seem right to me. Bitcoin is providing a service for savers by preserving their wealth. That service costs money to provide, and savers should help pay for it.
So how about you hold a vote to decide on the proper inflation rate? This is a more powerful version of the assurance contract.
Possible implementation:  Savers could vote by locking coins for a specified period of time. Votes are weighted according to ( locked)(time of lock).
System self-regulates. Savers do not wish to set the inflation rate higher than necessary, however if the mining seems inadequate, savers may want to pay a little bit (and vote for everyone else to pay) to boost the network security.
System captures the wisdom of the crowd about the proper interest rate, and also weights votes according to how much the individual will be directly affected.

Imagine there is a big room with 1000 people in it. In the middle of the people is a 3 ring binder full of papers that describe who has given money to whom.
There is a 25 bitcoin reward available for the first person who gather up some new transactions, and write them down on a sheet of paper, and add it to the binder.
To prevent everyone from trying to add a sheet of paper to the end all at once, you must prove that you solved a puzzle before anyone will agree that your sheet of paper is valid.
So if you want to add a sheet of paper to the binder, here is what you do:
You go around and ask people what transactions they would like included on the sheet of paper. They pay you transaction fees to put their transactions on your paper. You write down transactions on your paper, and then you have to solve a math puzzle before you can put the paper in the binder. The math puzzle is specially designed to require a lot of guess and check. On average, someone in the room will get the guess right in 10 minutes.
This lucky person adds their sheet of paper to the binder. Everyone else who was trying to add that paper gives up because the reward has been claimed. They all start working on the next paper.

This is a way of conceptualizing the topic that I do not think is helpful, and is producing incorrect predictions about the future.
The important point to notice is that those are uses of bitcoin that cause people to choose to purchase bitcoins, even though they do not anticipate making a profit. This is the key difference between bitcoin and a pyramid scheme.
For this reason, bitcoin does not require a rising price in order for demand to be maintained. Now it remains to be seen whether bitcoin will ever have a stable price, but it will not fail in the regular pyramid scheme fashion.

I haven't read the ruling, but here is the scenario that I think would be unfair.
I earn $3.30 after taxes
I buy $3 worth of bitcoin, and pay $0.30 in GST
I use the bitcoin to buy a coffee for $2.72 + $0.27 GST
In this scenario, GST is applied twice, just because I am using bitcoin.
Are they not doing that?
Edit: The problem with charging GST on the "purchase" of money is that GST is applied when the money is used for its end purpose. This is like charging GST on firewood when you purchase it, and then charging it again when you burn the firewood.
Another way to think about it is to say that the purchase price for money is the exchange fee. That would be under 1% typically, and I suppose Australia could charge GST on that and not look ridiculous.

TLDR: People will not use Bitcoin because it goes up in value so they will have to pay taxes on all the profit. (derp)
This is an opportunity for a company (like Coinbase) to provide tax accounting services. Coinbase could compute gains on your bitcoin sales, and on purchases made in Bitcoin. At the end of the year, Coinbase could simply sell some of your Bitcoin and cut you a check to give to the IRS. Sure, your wealth would go down in Bitcoin terms, but not as much as you gained through appreciation vs. the dollar.
Also, this really makes the fact that the government is taxing us via inflation stand out sharply. Consider: You receive $100 in bitcoin for a job you do. A few years later, you spend the bitcoin. In the meantime, the dollar has been devalued through inflation. So now the bitcoin has similar purchasing power, but it is worth $110. Here comes the insult:
The tax man sends you a bill for $3 based on your $10 "gain". But it wasn't a gain with respect to purchasing power. It is only a gain relative to the devalued dollar. You are escaping the full brunt of inflation but some of it still gets you by being converted into additional taxation, even if you never own any dollars, because you are required to pretend that you converted to dollars to make the purchase. You are taxed on any inflation that you dodge by not holding dollars.
**That's a real bitch.**
Consider it in a hyper-inflationary scenario, where your $100 of bitcoin is worth $200 a couple of years later. Now you get to choose to have your wealth in dollars, where they take away 50% of your purchasing power via inflation, or in Bitcoin, where they take away 15% of your purchasing power via taxes. This is actually an inflation-adjusted capital gains tax rate of [infinity]( since the inflation adjusted capital gain is zero. I guess it's pretty hard to (legally) escape wealth destruction via inflation.
Even if you believe taxation is ok, it seems like you should only be taxed on your inflation-adjusted capital gains.

I concede the point. Savers do not get a free ride in every sense of the word possible. I will drop the phrase.
Let's start over:
Savers are getting a lot of value out of the security of the network. If the network needs money to keep it secure, savers represent an interested party who could be asked to fund the project, because they care, because they can afford it, (and assuming there are no competing crypto-currencies which offer a better cost/benefit ratio -- hat tip to Peter Todd).
This could be implemented in a democratic way by asking savers to vote on what rate of inflation they believe is needed to provide adequate funding for mining. If the alternative was for mining power to dwindle until the network fails, this strategy may be seen as attractive.

1. Right. It is customary to render numbers in hex in computer-land because of this.
2. Displayed where? Any display meant for human consumption would use hex. If you actually looked at the blockchain itself, I think you would just see binary though. (And the hashes would occupy 256 bits of storage.)
3. Yes. It is is called SHA256 because it outputs an integer that is between 0 and 2^256. (I'm guessing...)

I am not trying to be nasty and tell you to leave. I am telling you about an alt-coin that takes your concerns seriously and implements the only solution that I am aware of, which is Proof of Stake. I have many times argued for adding Proof of Stake to Bitcoin, but I do not believe it will be implemented here unless something catastrophic happens, like there is a malicious mining attack, which I believe is unlikely to happen because there is no incentive to do it.
Edit: If I believed that a catastrophic mining attack were probable, I would take my advice and buy Peercoin while it is cheap, and then wait for that mining attack to kill Bitcoin.

Perhaps, or perhaps the difficulty will be so high from people heating their homes that even this very efficient arrangement will not ROI.
Consider -- the only cost of POH when the waste heat is warming a house is the difference between the cost of running your furnace compared with running your mining rig, per unit heat. That cost could get very close to zero, especially in homes that already happen to be heating with electricity instead of fuel.
An electric water heater, or anything that uses resistive heat instead of a heat pump would produce the hashes for zero marginal cost, and earn the owner bitcoins. Your power plant arrangement will need to be exceptionally efficient to compete against *free* energy.

It's ridiculous, and sad. If I do not enter into New York, and interact only with people who tell me they are not from New York, then what I do should not be any of New York's business.
Suppose Saudi Arabia passed a law saying it is illegal to sell liquor to a Saudi. Do you expect American businesses will start asking for identification to confirm that people are not Saudi? People would look at you like a crazy person even to suggest it.
The maximum Saudi Arabia could possibly claim, would be that Saudis cannot buy or sell liquor, or that people visiting Saudi Arabia cannot. What jurisdiction do they have in Houston, over the residents of Houston? Or Madrid? Or Tokyo? There is no formulation of the idea that even comes close to making any sense.

Here's a compromise for Ben Lawsky. Companies like Bitstamp put a checkbox on their website that says "By checking this box, I indicate that I am a resident of New York."
New Yorkers can simply self identify by checking the box. If a person from New York fails to check the box, then by all means, prosecute them for fraudulently evading regulations.
If you check the box, Bitstamp can politely inform you that they cannot legally serve you.
New Yorkers would then be in the driver's seat. They could:
1. Decide that the regulations are worthwhile, and only use compliant services.
2. Lie and use non-compliant services, and face the threat of penalties.
3. Pressure their representatives to remove the regulations.
If a person fails to self-identify as a resident of New York, it seems that Bitstamp would not be under the jurisdiction of New York law.
Something tells me that if Lawsky took this route, the proper feedback mechanisms would be set up, and everything would come out ok.

Bitcoins intrinsic value is not zero. Bitcoins offer you a convenient way to transmit value so that you can spend more time with your children and less time filling out forms. Bitcoin is a cheaper way to transmit money, which saves on fees. Bitcoin offers you a safe way to store value that you don't want to spend immediately. Everyone wants to store value for future use, and in many countries Bitcoin provides the best option for doing this.

We just have to develop technical solutions for those who want to pay taxes. Wallets that track gains and export to turbotax. Online wallet providers could issue 1099s.
Online wallet providers could also give you an account to hold dollars. You could buy your coffee by instantly buying bitcoins out of your dollar account and sending them to the coffee shop. Kind of like a reverse bit-pay. When your dollar account gets low, an automatic top-off event could be triggered, selling bitcoins from your bitcoin account and realizing a capital gains event.

As far as I can tell, Gox sent people bitcoins when they asked for a withdrawal. Due to a bug in their software, Gox thought that the transaction failed, and re-attempted with different inputs. Both attempts in fact succeeded, so the first set of inputs were spent (which Gox did not realize.) Then gox tried to re-use the first set of inputs to handle someone else's withdrawal request, and that failed because they were already spent.
As a result, their accounts got all screwed up and they had to stop transactions for a while to figure out what happened. Also, they paid some people twice, so they lost some of the money, but we don't know how much. Possibly some sneaky people noticed that they could be paid twice if they quickly broadcast an edited version of a withdrawal transaction.

By vigilante I just meant a private citizen forcibly punishing another person for violating social norms. In stable societies, the punishment function has been delegated to the state. When punishment is administered by private citizens, what you end up with, as far as I can tell, is a vendetta cycle because the opposing parties have similar amounts of power.
I'm not saying that being a vigilante is always wrong. Sometimes it may be the best option, but you run the serious risk of retaliation.

I agree with your definition of "intrinsic value" but disagree with your conclusion that bitcoins have none. Bitcoins have intrinsic value in the same way that the services of a notary public have intrinsic value. People are willing to pay the transaction fees because they like having a way of quickly and securely transporting value.
This is not so different from the (relatively meager) intrinsic value of a piece of gold as a material to make earrings or semi-conductor package wires out of.
For some other slightly closer example, imagine old postage stamps. They may have a face value of 5 cents, and be traded around for $10. One could properly say that they have an intrinsic value of 5 cents, because an individual can buy the stamp with the intention of consuming it by sending a letter, rather than with any intention of using it to acquire some other thing. Bitcoins are somewhat similar. You can buy a bitcoin with the intention of making an international online purchase go more smoothly. You might even pay a premium for the bitcoin to reflect its "intrinsic value" of helping you make your purchase.
The whole intrinsic/extrinsic dichotomy is a poor way to conceptualize the value of a bitcoin -- or of any good that is being used as money. The value of the coins in transit cannot fall below the value of the commerce that is in transit, which creates a totally different mechanism for establishing a reliable "floor" value than "intrinsic value" does. Furthermore, there will be demand for bitcoins to store value, with no particular profit motive, just because you want to spend in the future and not right now. This is another source of demand which is indefinitely sustainable, even if the price stops rising. The fact that bitcoin is deflationary, which sort of magically gives you a small portion of every bitcoin that is destroyed somewhere in the world, gives it an immediate edge over most or all other currencies as a store of value.

Most people would draw a distinction between theft and taxation, although there are many similarities as you pointed out. I'm not going to allow the differences to be thrown away by using the same word on both.

Who needs such an ecosystem? I certainly do not. The masses of people being economically fucked into an early death by the wealthy power brokers of the world certainly do not need such an ecosystem. Bitcoin represents a rare chance to level the playing field a little bit, by depriving the parasitic financial industry some of the blood it has gotten used to sucking out of everyone. If these people work against that vision, then as far as I'm concerned they cannot go to hell fast enough.

Why would anyone want coins that can be spent some places but not others? Why would I, as a buyer on bitstamp, want to buy the limited use coins?
Perhaps if they cost a little less, I could be persuaded to buy them.
So then there would be two different prices available. You could pay 100% for the whitelisted coins, and 60% for the coins that work some places but not other places.
So now if you are accepting coins for your socks, you need to know what kind of coins the person is paying you with, so you know how many coins to ask for.
Are you really going to just accept whatever they give you and not check whether the coins are worth $600 or just worth $360? That doesn't seem like an attractive choice either.

Everyone who is in Bitcoin should already have factored in the risk of a 51% attack to their expectations. It is specifically described in the original whitepaper. Despite what the ad says, Bitcoin is not actually a magic investment that goes up with no risk. The reason that it is not already at $100k per coin is because it could go to zero. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose.

Haven't watched the video but I just debated the shit out of this earlier in the week. Basically, when folks say "intrinsic value" they (the best thinkers among them) seem to mean value that can be consumed by a person without trading the object with another person. This strikes me as a worthwhile distinction and concept, even if "intrinsic" is a confusing label.
One kind of thing can be "used" and the other kind of thing is just a token that cannot be used but only given to a person to motivate behavior. (Which, it must be admitted, is sort of "using" it.) The idea is that the token is fragile because people may stop responding to it.

We need a "dirty" blockchain. We need a blockchain that has blocks in it that the *majority would prefer are not there.* We even need a blockchain that contains blocks that the majority label **criminal.** The same cover that criminals hide under is the cover that shields rebels and upstarts from the crushing feet of the tyrants, and new-entrants from being smothered by the entrenched power-brokers.
Find a math-based solution to the double-spend problem, or live with the risks. Do not reach for a solution that is too political in nature, or that invites or enables ambiguous "judgement calls" that so often are used to mask the subtle, intentional, persistent localization of power.
1. ~~Requires that the hashpower be de-anonymized. Now the governments of the world always know who to go talk to when they decide to impose licensing, fees, "guidelines" on what mining is deemed orthodox, and ultimately armed men with handcuffs.~~

3. Allows the majority opinion to extinguish the minority opinion, rather than forcing the majority to accept some proportional representation of the minority.

@_date: 2014-05-05 16:16:26
Gavin mentions that his objection to Proof of Stake is that the "rich get richer." This strikes me as odd for a couple of reasons.
1. He has said before that the biggest problem with Proof of Stake is that there is nothing at stake -- i.e. it cannot actually force consensus because people can use their stake to vote for more than one fork. This would be the reason I reject current POS systems. I hold out hope for the "proof of burn" idea, which could burn bitcoins instead of electricity, and be designed to force people to commit to a fork. Even if POW does not consume much energy from a planetary perspective, consuming less would obviously be better.
2. The problem of the "rich get richer" has always struck me as being much worse in a POW system than in a POS system. In a theoretical POS system, poor people can earn a little money by securing the network with their stake. Rewards can increase linearly according to how much stake you use. In a POW system, if you don't spend thousands of dollars on your mining rig, you are likely to lose money by mining. It is a game that only the rich can benefit from, and the richer the better. The profit grows non-linearly with the size of the investment. In other words, with POS, everyone has the opportunity to get richer. In POW, only the rich get richer.

1. Maybe you're ok with picking a pool that has 20% hashing power and then waiting an hour for the first confirmation. Note that once you get that first confirmations, the subsequent confirms come every 10 min.
2. Ideally, you would modify the protocol so that you can include a list of approved pools to receive the fee. Then the pool that actually mines the transaction would get the fee, if they were approved. The extra information in the transaction would be small - maybe 16 bytes per pool, - and perhaps an acceptable cost to avoid a mining monopoly.

I always find it amusing when people try to grab the moral high ground by calling something "theft." Like when so many on this sub refer to taxes as theft. For there to be theft, there must be a social consensus around the structure of property rights. It's like if someone said that a particular clause in the constitution were "illegal." It may be immoral or unhelpful, but to call it illegal is just to be confused. If we are debating the social consensus and the structure of the protocol, it makes no sense to talk about theft.

If security is high enough from transaction fees, then you don't need any inflation. You only need inflation if security is not high enough. Perhaps such a scenario cannot happen, and if it cannot, then we will not need a plan to deal with it.

It is not moral to accept funds that are stolen.
It is for this reason that Amazon.com, for example, is required to evaluate whether or not I stole the money I used to pay for my new iPad. They don't do a very good job of this right now, but perhaps this is why they are introducing their new phone. This phone has several cameras built in, which look all around. Soon every Amazon customer will be required to carry one of these phones at all times. Amazon cloud servers will use these special cameras to monitor your environment 24/7 and determine whether you are stealing money.
If Amazon determines that you are not stealing any money, then -- and only then -- can they morally sell you the iPad and accept your money.

Bitcoin doesn't have a "huge" intrinsic value. The thing is, it outperforms other money transmission options on cost, speed and security. So the total number of circulating bitcoins is going to end up representing a lot of moving money.

I agree that the marginal cost of storing a UTXO is zero. But the cost of maintaining the **value** of the bitcoin stored thereby is for the miners to keep on mining at a high enough level. And the saver does not contribute to pay for this cost.
People do not care about the UTXO being preserved per se, they care about the preservation of the access to value that the UTXO provides.
Presumably the saver would be disappointed if the miners stopped mining and the saver were left with a key to a worthless UTXO, and presumably they could be motivated to pay to prevent that from happening.

This is awesome. People think of full nodes as protecting the network, and to some extent they do that. More than that, though, full nodes protect the person who is accepting bitcoin, because they allow the transaction to be validated all the way back to the genesis block.
Sure, you can connect to some anonymous node and trust them, but why not get a fully validating node and know that you're fully protected? A standalone device basically eliminates any risk of getting hacked, and it could have Quality of Service rules ready to go so that your Netflix doesn't slow down.

 Depending on your definition of "intrinsic value" I may agree with you. If you could define intrinsic value for me, I could better know whether to agree or disagree with you. Here I am defining "intrinsic value" as "value in a thing that the person can consume directly, without converting it to some other thing." Here the "extrinsic value" is value of the car you purchase with the BTC, and the "intrinsic value" is found in the convenience and security of the transaction, which you get by using Bitcoin.


Bitcoin has a lot of advantages over gold, actually. It is easier to physically secure for example, and easier to transport, and it doesn't occupy space.

If gold dealers need your identification they can just request that you provide it. How does that involve Bitcoin at all? If I pay for my gold with cash, do they need me to tell them where I obtained the cash? This is all bullshit.
Edit: I feel like regulators see the blockchain and start drooling. Since one could theoretically trace each bitcoin back to the day it was mined and see if it was involved with any nefarious activities, well then now we need to use bitcoins to establish people's identities. False! There are ways to establish a person's identity. Leveraging the blockchain to establish identity is not necessary and threatens fungibility.
Similarly, the fact that my bitcoins passed through a tumbler does not stop the gold place from asking for a photocopy of my driver's license.

The subtle bit (which is capable of appreciating) is that the effect of savers limiting the money supply does indeed drive up the value of each coin, which of course increases the value of the block reward. However, we are talking about the future, where there will be just transaction fees. Transaction fees do not increase in value with the appreciation of the currency -- the value of these are instead set by demand for transactions and supply of space in each block.
If the value of each satoshi goes up, the miners fee just requires fewer satoshis.

There is nothing preventing them from applying bank-level security to the dollars. In fact, I think they would be legally required to do so. They could use multi-sig or some of the other cryptographic ideas that are still maturing to protect the bitcoin side of your account. They could simply not have the private key at all, like blockchain.info. Then the top-off would require you to sign a transaction.


The dollars in the dollar account would probably only be converted to bitcoin from your perspective. From the perspective of the wallet provider, no conversion probably needs to take place since they probably already have bitcoins handy. That might help make them more competitive than Visa/Mastercard/Paypal.
This is equivalent to asking why you would want to pay in bitcoin at all. I guess there is no one answer to that. Maybe it's because that's how the merchant prefers to be paid. Maybe the merchant offers a small discount like some merchants do for cash payment. Maybe you are paying a freelance person who takes bitcoins, or buying something off of craigslist. Maybe you are purchasing gyft stuff for the discount. Maybe you don't like giving out your credit card number. Maybe you just like bitcoin as a political statement. Maybe you are traveling in a different country and are avoiding currency conversion fees.
Or maybe no such conversion takes place at all. Maybe the dollars just get spent as dollars using a debit card, and you therefore can "spend your bitcoins" anywhere that accepts Visa.


To simplify capital gains reporting, primarily. However, having a debit card account that gets topped off from bitcoins is a nice bonus.

Yes, you could choose to not accept non-white coins, and you might want to have the power to screen out non-white coins.
In order to screen out non-white coins you are going to have to run the coinvalidation software.
But notice what has happened here. Now **everyone** must run the coinvalidation software. Because if they don't run it, they will run the risk of failing to notice that they are being paid with non-white coins.
Also, consider the timing of the classification. What if you buy some coins on the exchange, and then the next day, whoops! Those coins have been classified as non-white, because we discovered they were sold buy a hacker. So sorry for you! They were white when you bought them, but now they are non-white, and now you have coins that are worth less than what you bought them for.

Recovering coins from dead wallets is not necessary for the bitcoin economy. However, it would help keep the size of the unspent transaction pool smaller, which could theoretically become important, and it also could be promote more mining, if for some reason the transaction fees were not paying for enough security. It will probably not be a pressing issue for a while, or forever.

The central idea here is that if the original manufacturer can make a duplicate, then in principle the thing can be counterfeited. So you start by finding a manufacturing process that cannot make duplicates, and then you just measure it and sign the measurement. I don't know whether it would work in practice, but in principle I think it offers a unique strategy to prevent counterfeiting.

That's just my standard advice for cold storage. You might find some ideas in there that you like.
I do recommend generating the key with dice. The consensus is that bitaddress.org uses adequate entropy, but it is easy to roll dice and why not cut out a potential source of problems?
Also, I think you should keep a paper copy of the private key. If you don't want to print it, copy it by hand in two formats (WIF and HEX). Electronics are just not as durable as paper.
I stamped the dice rolls into a metal plate and can re-create all of my private keys from that plate.
I don't bip38 encrypt, because I store my paper wallets in a tamper-evident envelope in a bank safety deposit box. Encrypt if you think there is a realistic possibility that someone will snoop the papers, but remember that you could forget your passphrase.
If it's $1000 then you can probably cut corners. If it's $50,000 then it's probably worth taking every available precaution.

They can wait until you broadcast a transaction, and discover your public key. Once they have it they could feed it into their quantum computer. If they can use it to crack your private key within a few seconds they could create a new transaction and double-spend your bitcoins. If they get it onto enough nodes, they could steal your bitcoins.
This seems pretty hard to do, frankly, and pretty unlikely. There are proposals floating around for making bitcoin quantum-proof, but they involve much larger blocks, which would entail some more centralization than we currently have.

"perjorative" ... where was spell-check when I needed it?


Not self evident. If I thought it was self evident that my proposal was a death sentence, I would not have made it.
Anyway, I was not proposing a permanent high inflation rate. I was proposing that when people have some bitcoin to save, they can vote on what interest rate they would like to pay. The average interest rate that people are willing to pay would be adopted by the protocol. Presumably this would be just high enough to satisfy people that there is adequate mining, and no higher.
After all:

Nothing is stopping anyone, and this has been done many times. The problem is that the resulting blockchain is not accepted anywhere. It is not accepted by any merchants, and no one will give you any money for the coins that are mined.
Edit: Well, that's a little too black and white. If your particular blockchain happens to catch on, like dogecoin for example, then it may become valuable. However most people believe, and I believe, that Bitcoin will account for &gt;90% of the crypto-economy, and the remaining 10% will probably be dominated by a single alt-coin, with the remaining blockchains competing for a small fraction of the total economy.

If you want to try out what it is like for your poor overheating mining hardware, go here:

Note that it ends with a zero. That is the first number (represented in ascii) that I found that created a hash that ended with a zero in hexadecimal. One out of every 16 numbers should do that on average. (The next one is 38.)

Agreed that security is crazy.
If it ignored the die rolls it would be discovered very quickly. You could input a test sequence of die-rolls in a javascript wallet emulator and see that it didn't come out the same. If it generates the private keys from RNG then verification is much more difficult.
Insecure nonce only hurts you if you re-use addresses, which is discouraged anyway. Also, everyone is scanning for the nonce vulnerability, so people do not have an incentive to do that to a hardware wallet on purpose, as they will probably not be the one to profit from it.
Trust is not a useful concept to me. I'm trying to make choices to minimize the probability of being harmed, while also factoring in the cost I am paying for security.

Solution --&gt; Make bitcoin illegal!
Then they won't be able to buy anything with their bitcoin unless they use the black market! Poof! No more terrorists!
Seriously, though, this question is the same as asking: "Suppose terrorists start using cell phones to coordinate? How do you stop this from happening?"
The answer is, you cannot stop this from happening. Like cell phones, Bitcoin makes things easier for all people, including bad people.
You stop terrorism by making the world a nicer place to live, by improving political conditions, and by spreading the idea that "religious faith" has no predictive power and produces people who are not mentally equipped to deal with the world that actually exists, and who are a danger to themselves and others.
Better technology has the potential to actually reduce terrorism by making the world a nicer place to live.

I trust Mycelium, and I use their android app to spend bitcoins from my paper wallets, rather than create my transactions offline.
After a few thousand people use Entropy for a few months, I would feel pretty safe storing money there. Making a paper wallet can be a pain, so I might even use it.
Most of my bitcoin will probably be in dice-rolled paper wallets. For small numbers of wallets with lots of bitcoins, there is just nothing Entropy can offer me other than less certainty that my private key is known only to me.

I agree that it is probably not politically viable. However, I think it is a shame that the bitcoin community has developed a reflexive "if you don't like it, get out" mentality.
I'm not suggesting that we make changes unless the majority agrees that they are an improvement.

I think the problem is that this assumption is shaky. What tends to happen is that the hardware owners will stay with the pool, and hope that some **other** guy will move his hardware.
And that's because the cost of switching is so high.
But if the cost of switching were not high -- like if you were selecting who to target your fee to -- then maybe altruism could nudge the balance so that the bad pool was less profitable.

Yeah, and I don't think you would need to roll dice for every transaction. You could probably roll dice one time as a seed value to stock up the entropy of the wallet, and then it can just make private keys and nonces forever just with formulas. If that is not possible, maybe it could ask for more die inputs when it is running low on entropy.

Hashing means you take the block and you run it through a math function that turns it into a totally unpredictable 256 bit number.

Not begging the question, using logical induction based on observable history. Human societies work this way. They start with private parties competing. Pretty soon the competition gets intense and violence is used as a competitive tool. Power accumulates into coalitions, which come to an uneasy truce, laws are drawn up to punish dissenters. This has happened everywhere, in every epoch, is the observable fact of life in every single corner of our planet, and is not unique to humans. As far as I can tell, the human brain is based on the same architecture, as is every single multi-cellular organism. This is just the way things operate in darwinian universe.

Don't confuse the cost with the exchange rate. The cost of using a bitcoin is the same whether the exchange rate is $1 or $1000. (Cost being foregone purchasing power.) It is the mining fee, which the market sets to maybe 20 cents or so for a prompt transaction. Plus the exchange fee, which might be 0-2%.

If you haven't already checked out my [secure wallet]( post, I think it is worth a read.
It's my belief that Bitcoin can't make use of more than 62 die rolls, due to the RIPEMD function. Personally I would prefer rolling 62 times and taking the SHA256 than rolling 99 times and using the integer converted from base 6. No point in rolling 37 more times!
Also, I rolled 1 high entropy integer and then just keep re-using it by appending a password and an index and hashing to get a key. That lets   me keep a copy of the seed in a safety deposit box and a copy on an offline computer. From the seed and the index I can re-create any address when I need it.

Also, it has a very hard-to-quantify mechanism. Miners cannot actually blacklist any transactions with this, as it is not a chain reorg. It is actually worse than black-listing, because to the degree that it works at all, it works by causing self-censorship out of fear of being penalized. I would suspect that under self-censorship the swath of transactions that get passed-over is even larger than the ones that would actually get explicitly blacklisted.

So now you have your "choice".
You can either choose to opt out, which means that people will dump non-whitelisted coins in your lap that you cannot sell. Or you can choose to opt-in and run software to screen out those coins.

Mike: "Are you going to have steak?"
Me: "No, the menu is going to be all vegetarian."
Mike: "But steak is so awesome. How are you going to get any customers in there if you don't offer steak?"
Me: "Well, we have some delicious vegetarian dishes, and some people don't even like eating steak. Some people prefer vegetarian."
Mike: "Dude, you aren't going to get any customers. Steak isn't just awesome, steak is *intrinsically* awesome."
Well now Mike has just mis-used the concept of *intrinsic* to come to an incorrect prediction about the viability of my restaurant. I suppose it would be pedantic and petty of me to point out that no food is *intrinsically* awesome, and that what food people like is not a fact that resides within the food itself but rather partly in the properties of the food and partly in the properties of the eater.

SHA256() returns an integer. The way you want to display it is up to you. You can display it in base2, base10 or base16 or whatever. The website just displays the integer in base16.
When you are talking about "how many zeroes" you need to specify the base. One base16 zero is as hard to achieve as 4 base2 zeroes.

You send coins to the address without exposing the private key to an online system, yes. If it gets confirmed by the miner, then the coins are there. If you have a private key that maps to that address, then in the future you will be able to move the coins. That's how Bitcoin works.
The only thing you have to fear is if your private key does not actually map to that public address. You can verify that the private key works by using an offline computer and a copy of bitaddress.org or most other paper wallet generators.

There are a lot of places that electrical resistance is used to heat stuff. So install SHA256 in those places.  Perhaps there are places and circumstances where electrical heat is cost competitive with fuel. Perhaps natural gas will become more expensive over time, and electricity will become cheaper.
There isn't enough money in the mining business to split it up among everyone who takes a hot shower anyway!
I find it hard to swallow that it is settled that we cannot kill the profit margins of big players by soaking up people's need to heat stuff.

For spending cold storage I have a dedicated android phone that has no cell service. I did a factory wipe of the phone and then installed Mycelium. Most of the time the phone is powered off.
When it's time to spend from cold storage, I scan the private key using the cold storage feature and immediately spend the coins. I never use that private key again. It is "hot" for less than a minute. Also, each cold storage address has a reasonably small amount of money so that if anything went wrong it would hurt but not be horrible.
That's good enough for me. I want to use something like Mycelium because it is very popular, and therefore any problems with the software will be noticed quickly.

The IRS has a rule called the "wash sale rule".
Let's say you buy 1 bitcoin for $600
The next day you sell 1 bitcoin for $500
The next day you buy 1 bitcoin for $550
It would *appear* that you lost $100 on your sale, and you could apply that loss to your taxes. However, the wash rule says that in this situation, you cannot claim the loss yet. (Otherwise people would have the option to get favorable tax treatment by taking losses by selling and then immediately repurchasing a security.)
Instead of taking a loss, what you do is add the $100 to the price of the second purchase, giving it a "cost basis" of $650 instead of $550. Then when you sell the second bitcoin you will be benefiting from the loss.
The calculations get freakish when you are buying and selling un-equal quantities.

No one mentioned any guarantees. If a guarantee was required before something was a good investment, then there would be no good investments at all.
Bitcoin has been roughly exponential for 1251 days on that chart. There is no indication that it is starting any kind of transition.
Bitcoin still has a very small market penetration. I think it is rational to expect the next 365 days to behave similar to the previous 1251 days. (A period 3 times as long.)

To me, "waste" is not a useful concept for understanding something, because it has all of your values and conclusions baked into it. It is definitely true that bitcoin will consume those resources, and it would be nice if we could find a way to get the security without sacrificing so much energy.
Beyond the mere consumption of resources that we could use for some other purpose, Bitcoin accelerates our consumption of non-renewables, which could accelerate a population overshoot collapse of our civilization. Of course I hope we figure our shit out and switch to renewable energy sources in time to prevent that but we've never run this experiment on this scale before...

Yes. Almost any random number from 0 to 2^256 will be fine. For example, the number "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001337" is a private key, which corresponds to the bitcoin address "1BouazM6y9R62FBUTN7q1W12qJHoRzsvGK"

Bad, bad branding. Coins should not be validated. If I sell a used car to someone, and they give me bitcoin, there must be absolutely no question whatsoever in anyone's minds that those coins have zero significant history. Period. They have zero risk of being frozen. They will not increase the odds that I will be investigated by law enforcement.
I don't care if they were used to fund hit jobs. As soon as they move to a new address they are clean. They aren't even the same coins. The hit-job coins were melted down into raw monetary energy and cast into brand news coins by the transaction.
That's what fungibility means, and any compromise on this principle is completely unacceptable. Ideally we would have a zero-cash like technological solution implemented.

Bravo. Sorry, you caught me in a bad mood last night.


This is the kind of statement that makes me think it is not worth trying to defend my position. You are hearing things that I am not saying. What I said was that it was "a little like", and what you heard was "it's on the exact same level as".
And then I went on to say in which specific aspect they are alike:
"Everyone keeps asking 'But what is keeping the [thing that we are worried about from happening]?' and the answer is that you hope that the people with their fingers on the triggers do not have the incentive to pull them."
I did not compare the effects of nuclear war to the effects of a 51% attack. I did not compare the probability of a world leader initiating nuclear war to the probability of a world leader initiating a 51% attack. You are responding to messages that I did not intend to convey, and which in my opinion, the text I wrote does not convey.
The message I am trying to convey is that there is no technical solution available that will make a 51% attack impossible. What we have instead, is the conjecture that the people who are capable of pulling off a 51% attack are not motivated to do so. Nuclear war and a 51% attack have this feature in common.
If you think it is offensive or sacrilegious to point out this similarity, given the vast difference in the magnitude of the effects of nuclear holocaust and of bitcoin getting trashed, then I understand, and you are certainly entitled to say so. However, there is nothing illogical about my statement.

This could all be easier if each person had a Unique Identification Number. They could just input that number as part of the transaction.
For convenience, you could tattoo it as a bar code on your arm.
In fact, I don't see why people don't have numbers emblazoned on their shirts, so that if they commit a crime, and it is caught by CCTV, they can be instantly identified. Of course, you would probably want to mandate orange shirts so that the number is legible in lots of different lighting conditions.

There is an important factor that this analysis does not take into consideration. If you run a miner, your total energy bill goes up because the miner is not as efficient as the heat pump, but you get paid in bitcoin, so it could still be worth doing if the difficulty is low enough and the price of bitcoin is high enough.

If they can figure out how to do this, they will solve most of the issues that makes bitcoin impractical for buying stuff in brick and mortar stores.

Bitcoins are not owned, they are controlled. If you "own" a thing, that means the society you live in acknowledges your right to control it. Welcome to the difference between sovereignty and serfdom.
Edit: to be more clear, Bitcoins are "owned" in the sense that the country you live in probably has an opinion about whether you should be in control of the Bitcoin or whether someone else should. But Bitcoin can operate without this  this old social technology we call "property" and since governments will find it difficult to separate a bitcoin from the person who controls it, "ownership" is less important than control.

The "Proof of Work" requires you to do a hash function on the block you are trying to add to the blockchain. "Difficulty" is measuring how many zeroes the result of the hash function needs to begin with. The more zeroes, the more guesses are necessary on average before you find the right number to add to the block so that it satisfies the requirement.
The goal behind Proof of Work is to find something that the network is capable of doing (executing 6 gazillion guesses in 10 minutes) that an individual node cannot do. If the nodes were capable of creating a block in 10 minutes, then there would be no way to pick just one to add to the chain.
The difficulty graph is exponential because hashing power is being added to the network in an exponential fashion. This is partly because the equipment is getting more powerful exponentially over time, and partly because the price is going up exponentially over time. (So more electricity can be spent on each block and you still make a profit.)

I am happy to see experimental anarcho-capitalist enclaves being tried out, and the more individuals can control the parameters of their own lives, the better.

@_date: 2014-01-24 19:58:50
I hear you, but let's see what happens first. The assumption is that a transaction fee market can pay for enough mining to secure the network after the bootstrap phase. Above a certain level of mining, we would just be wasting energy, not providing meaningful additional security.
Also the assumption is that a deflating supply of useable coins will not lead to an unstable economy. This setup is simpler than trying to fiddle with a re-mining mechanism, and it may work out just fine.
Edit: Another possibility might be to use the dead coins in some sort of lottery given to people running full nodes. Peercoin does something like this to incentivize running a full node. Again, you don't want to make the protocol more complicated to solve imaginary problems, so we'll have to see whether there are enough nodes without any reward like this.

1. Ordinarily you would store bitcoins in one or more addresses in one wallet. A wallet is just anything you use to manage your addresses.

I deny it. All the government needs to do is to pass a law that says that employers are obligated to withhold income tax, and vendors are required to charge sales tax. Normally the government does not find it necessary to take assets electronically from people's bank accounts without their consent.
They do not have to petition the people for funds. They pass a law mandating that the funds be turned over, and then imprison people who do not comply.

Yes, I see where you are coming from, and I am sure you see where I am coming from.
However, just to restate my observation, you say:


followed by


I would point out that of course an unloaded weapon cannot go into full-auto firing mode, as it is incapable of firing. Which means that by an unsophisticated read of your statement, an unloaded weapon is not an assault rifle.
I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse for no reason, but rather to highlight this point. Some pieces of machinery cannot be made into an assault rifle very easily. For example, a revolver cannot be modified in any practical way that would make it into an assault rifle. Neither could a shotgun or a bolt-action rifle.
There is a meaningful distinction to be made when you are talking about a weapon that is specifically engineered to be capable of being used as an assault rifle. It is my understanding that the difference between a gun that is not in this configuration and a gun that is in this configuration is the swapping out of a couple of parts. This is not so trivial as the difference between being unloaded and being loaded, especially if the parts are difficult to obtain, or difficult to obtain without informing the government. However, this is a source of confusion and confused language, whether or not there are anti-gun propagandists in play.
By the way, I am not particularly anti-gun. I have owned a 12 gauge for home defense, and enjoy shooting. I don't think guns stop many crimes, or deter the government, but nor do I think that prohibition would stop very many deaths, just as drug prohibition is counter-productive.
Also, I don't think that "assault rifles" are any particular category of dangerous to society. It is fair to say that someone armed with a weapon that can fire rapidly and has a large magazine is going to be able to kill a lot more people than someone who does not have these abilities. But that describes a larger set of weapons than just assault rifles. If the anti-gun crowd wanted to settle on a term, they could adopt RFHC or "rapid fire, high capacity" to describe a weapon that can achieve 10 shots in 10 seconds in the hands of a person without exceptional skill. That would be rigorous and useful enough to form a coherent target for the anti-gun crowd to focus on. Personally, if I'm in a crowd and someone is shooting into it, I want that son of a bitch to be armed with a muzzle-loaded gun.

You might be interested in my "uncounterfeitable physical token" idea. Make your coins out of wood. Use the wood grain as a fingerprint. Have a piece of software that can "recognize" the wood grain fingerprint by digesting it into an integer. Sign that digest with your manufacturer's private key. Write the digital signature on the outside of the coin. Enclose a private key inside the wood block in a tamper-proof way. (E.g. cut it in half and glue it back together, maybe with some kind of dovetail joint arrangement so that it would be a total mess if you pried it open.) Write the address on the outside.
1. Anyone can verify that it is indeed made from wood. In other words, no one can ever duplicate the grain pattern.
2. With the help of an app anyone can take a picture of the wood grain and compare it to the signed code, and verify that you issued it. (Even if they don't have a connection to the internet during the transaction.)

Check out Proof of Stake, which is one possible way to reliably incorporate a large number of people into the consensus process. The idea is that it is very difficult to amass a large fraction of the coins of a successful crypto-currency.
The problem with POS seems to be that no one has come up with a completely satisfactory algorithm for implementing it.
In a recent video, Mike Hearn suggested that nodes produce a zero-knowledge proof that the owner of the node possesses a government-issued passport. This innovative approach could make sybil attacks much more difficult, but relies on some cutting edge techniques.

I don't know how Mycelium handles change, but it either sends the change back to your paper wallet (unlikely) or to a new address that it generates. You have to trust the software, but they do provide you with a way to back up the keys it generates, so that you can recover if you lose your phone or accidentally uninstall the app.
If you are dealing with a lot of money, consider the following practice. After you import your paper wallet, go ahead and export whatever you will not need to a new paper wallet.
If you are dealing with tons of money, you should probably be cold-signing your transactions using an offline computer running Armory or Electrum.

No doubt the NSA can be very sneaky in how they subvert crypto, but if you start with a die-rolled seed value, and then compute private keys based on a known formula, then there is no risk of NSA meddling.
As a simplified example, if the hardware wallet simply produced a private key by taking SHA256() of the sequence of numbers produced by the dice, then you could confirm that the wallet operates this way by running several tests. As soon as it produced the "wrong" private key it would be obvious.
In the actual hardware wallet, you could take a SHA256() of the die rolls to get a master private key, and use BIP38 to generate the rest of the addresses. As I understand it, another piece of software that lives on your computer could validate that every public address produced from the hardware wallet is properly derived from the master private key, based on the master public address.
At any rate, if the hardware wallets started deviating from the advertised protocol, someone somewhere would notice.

Whether ASIC mining is possible or not, mining will centralize. If it is not ASICS, then it will just be big farms running general purpose computers under optimum conditions and buying their hardware and power and cooling in bulk. Operations like that would drive the difficulty so high that a person without a lot of capital could not turn a profit, same as we have now.
Also, with CPU mining there is an incentive to do criminal botnet mining.
Proof of Stake could help, but there is controversy over whether a successful decentralized Proof of Stake algorithm has been invented. Apparently Peercoin and NXT both have not demonstrated that they can operate without centralized checkpoint authorities.
Proof of Burn offers an interesting algorithm where you can be rewarded by burning coins and placing a bet on which chain will be successful. If you are right, you get your coins back plus a reward. That avenue seems very promising to me.
If you buy into bitcoin or any POW coin, you are making a bet that the consolidation of mining into a few big players is not a problem.

Well, there are a lot of ways for us to misunderstand each other on that point, as the terms are so overloaded. What I am saying is that making a secure transfer of value, especially at a distance, is a problem humans have. Like the fact that it will rain on your head sometimes. Just like you might build a house to keep out the rain, you might want to use bitcoin to  send some money somewhere. In order to build a house, you need to have some bricks. That gives bricks intrinsic value to you. You don't go get the bricks because you are going to use them to motivate the butcher to give you a pork chop. You get the bricks because you plan on using them for some purpose.
In order to transmit some value, you are going to need to have some satoshis. You need to know a private key that unlocks some satoshis. You are going to need to pay someone to give you them, or you are going to have to mine them yourself.
The concepts are all very entangled, unfortunately, but consider this example.
Let's say you want to buy a computer from tiger direct. The computer costs $1,000. To make my example work, let's say Tiger Direct will accept a money order, or bitcoins.
Solution 1: You go to the grocery store, and buy a money order with $1000 printed on it. This costs you $3 to purchase. Also, you had to go to the grocery store. Now you buy a stamp to mail it. That's $.45. You have to put it in an envelope and into the mailbox. Now you wait a week and they get the money order and send you your computer.
Solution 2: You log into coinbase and you buy enough bits to get the computer. Let's say you spend $1000 for the bits, and they charge you $10 for a fee.
You weigh the two solutions, and decide that you're going to do solution 2. You do this because even though it cost you an additional $6.55 to do it with bitcoin, you avoided the inconvenience of going to the grocery store, and you get your computer delivered a little faster.
So it was worth it to you to spend $10 for the use of those satoshis. That's the intrinsic value to you. You used them, just like if you used a homing pigeon, or a bike messenger.

If feels like an awkward way of wording things to me, and I think it confuses a lot of people.
An "assault rifle" sounds like a thing, like a "shotgun" or a "pistol" or an "air-rifle". But it turns out it is not a thing after-all. It is more like a configuration.
Consider this -- if I had an assault rifle, and I unloaded it, you might say "now it is not an assault rifle." And I would say "What? How is this thing not an assault rifle?" And you could reply "That weapon is not configured to be an assault rifle, because it does not have all of the necessary equipment. It has no bullets." That would seem a little nutty, and I would wonder whether there wasn't a little manipulation of language happening on both sides of the gun debate.
Edit: 
Part of the problem is the word "assault" which does not describe anything physical about the gun, but rather what it is being used for. We use sloppy language like that frequently, like if I said I went target shooting with my "hunting rifle." I suppose it wasn't a hunting rifle at the time, as there was no hunting involved, but that kind of slop is ubiquitous in language.
Is there a handy term for a weapon that is designed to be optionally used as an assault rifle, but which has been configured not to be automatic?

Yes, sorry. I was responding to the proposal as Peter framed it.


Software encodes human judgement in an audit-able form. The problem is if you have a system that allows miners to basically reject old blocks based on their private discretion, and their ability to apply pressure to other miners. I am not afraid of people making decisions, so long as the decisions are mathematically formal and everyone can detect deviations from the consensus algorithm. (And that there is a penalty for deviating!)


It is very possible that we will live to see a dictatorship of machines. And it does not strike me as improbable that Bitcoin will play an important role in bringing that to pass. I do look forward to the dis-empowerment of our smug, self-aggrandizing politicians and their rich patrons, but time will tell whether we all end up as slaves in some tantalum mine, groaning under the whips of our graphene-brained masters.

As a simple first draft idea, you could say "If the coinbase is not paid to address x, destroy the fee"
If, for example, you chose a BTCGuild address, then the fee would not be able to go to Ghash miners.
Theoretically, BTCGuild and Ghash could both be controlled by illuminati, so this cannot provide a 100% guarantee, however I think as a practical matter it could help.

Yes. This was clearly the wrong way to introduce the idea, and lit up everyone's reptile brains.
We already have a concept that is pretty close to this with the dust limit, which makes some UTXOs unspendable. However with the dust limit, you can't erase the dust from the UTXO set because someday it might have enough value to not be dust. This method allows it to get deleted based on the fact that (based on the recent average transaction fee) the dust is worthless right now and we are justified in ejecting it from the pool permanently. I like the idea of deleting unspendable dust. I also like the idea of gently motivating people to think about how many UTXOs they are creating. If you don't put a price on something, people just gobble it up. That's fine if you can afford that, but based on what Gavin recently wrote, it may in fact be the limiting resource in Bitcoin.
This is a soft fork. I'm going to see if I can code it and create a pull request. Might take me a long time, but I could see creating a node that refuses to relay transactions that do not pay the calculated minimum fee.

Right. I get a little twitchy when I hear the "free market will fix it" being intoned like a religious mantra. Network effects and economies of scale can both provide the market leader with enormous power to restrict the choices of consumers. Companies like Wal-mart or Apple are so powerful that they can often swoop in and cut the balls off of competitors through networks of entirely consensual agreements. Some of these structures need to be broken up by making certain practices between consenting parties illegal, or we end up "taxed without representation" to rent-seeking corporations -- not because they can throw us in jail for non-compliance, but because they have destroyed all alternatives.
That said, I think the free market will take care of Apple. Partly because of HTML5. Partly because Bitcoin is just so great, and partly because consumers have viable alternatives in jail-breaking and in Android.

Fine, let's go with the google definition:
"An economic system in which prices are determined by unrestricted competition between privately owned businesses."
Forms of competition will always be constrained by laws, and consequently, there will never be a free market. The closest thing we have to this definition are areas where private groups are powerful enough that they can oppose the government successfully, (E.g. Mexican drug cartels) however even these extremely powerful groups are subject to pressure from the Mexican government. (Which restricts their options, therefore the market is not unrestricted as per the definition above.)

One more reason to tumble: It is the only way to make it impossible to track and block individual coins.

Freicoin charges you based on how much money you have. I think it's something like 5% per year. By contrast, Bitcoin charges you based on how many transactions you have. What I am suggesting is charging you based on how many UTXOs you have. If all of your money is in one output, this would mean that you would pay something ridiculously small, like less than 10 cents per year, no matter how much money is stored there. If you hog up everyone's mempool by keeping every bit in a separate output, then you would pay that 10 cents many many times. So it prompts you to consolidate your money if you plan on holding it for a long time. Which is what we need people to do if the mempool is under stress. I appreciate you asking. :-)

I recently broke up a paper wallet using blockchain.info. I noticed that they swept my old wallet and filled my new wallets in the same block. I assume this means that they broadcast transactions to fill the new wallets before they got a confirmation that they had swept my old wallet. Could I take advantage of this behavior with a replace-by-fee attack -- by sweeping my old wallet out from under them while still getting my new wallets filled?
Also, if Blockchain.info does not control does not anyone's bitcoins, and if they had zero confirmations on my in-sweep, then whose bitcoins did they send to my paper wallets?

Before getting into this bitcoin stuff, I never realized that there really are fences there that keep you from making money in certain ways, even if it is consensual and beneficial to everyone involved. I always felt free in this country, but now it seems like if you get too creative with how to earn money the cops show up. It's like there is a fence around "rich boys club" and you can only go in through the doors with the toll booths.
I mean, consider this. If Jake buys diamonds with 10K dollars, and then sells them to Mary for bitcoin, and then Mary sells the diamonds to Bob for dollars, that isn't money transmission, is it? But take the diamonds out of the equation and suddenly it's money transmission?
Do I need to apply for a money transmitter license to give cash to my barber? Are we all felons for spending more than $20,000 per year while not being licensed?

@_date: 2017-02-07 18:48:09
Words are our slaves, not our masters. People asking for consensus on what "Bitcoin" should mean are looking for political leverage over YOU.
But if I were going to make a stab at it, I would say that
* Bitcoin is the decentralized cryptographic system people use for controlling who can spend what percentage of the total value represented by all bitcoins, where bitcoins are the set of fungible tokens which are the result of incremental modifications to the system started in 2009 by Satoshi.
Pinning the definition of Bitcoin to the genesis block hash isn't the greatest, because that can be so trivially replicated by a system we would not call Bitcoin.
Pinning it to a particular POW makes no sense to me. SHA256 would need to be abandoned if it were broken -- would that be the end of Bitcoin? More likely it could be replaced if the dominant source of SHA256 mining were to begin acting in a way that the users of bitcoin found intolerable. It is true that changing the POW would be difficult, but there is no function that SHA256 serves in Bitcoin which could not be served by a different algorithm.
Finally, though I acknowledge that it is almost impossible to imagine the community ever deciding to change the issuance curve, if they ever did decide to I can't see how it would make sense to declare bitcoin dead and scrounge around for a new name.
The problem some people would have with my definition is that if there were a hard fork, then both sides might be "Bitcoin". I don't think this is due to a defect in my definition -- rather I think it reflects an error in our common-sense notion of the nature of "identity." Identity is way of thinking about reality that can fail to be useful in certain edge cases:
In the  we feel conflicted about whether the ship has retained its identity because all of the constituent parts are substituted over time. What is happening is that we are being confronted with the fact our concept of identity, which we enter the world quite confident about, is an over-simplification that can fail us.
In  it is not clear which person walking out of the teleporter is "you" since both of you have claim to the same history. This is almost exactly like the case in a Bitcoin hard fork, after which it can be possible that there are 2 Bitcoins with equal claim to the name.
This problem inherent in the nature of identity itself is a big problem for people who want to say that "because there is an obvious answer to the question of which chain is Bitcoin, hard forks can be expected to sort themselves out" which is what I suspect Gavin is getting at.

Bitcoin does not have to be anonymous at all. **AT ALL!!** There is nothing stopping me from asking everyone who sends me money to also please send me their identity. This option could be built into the payment protocol very easily.
This is like Bill Gates saying that he doesn't like money, because money can be used anonymously.
What we must refuse to do, however, is to make it *impossible* to use bitcoin anonymously. That is what these folks really want. They want to make the "authorities" aware of, and have a veto vote in every single transaction you engage in. This is like wearing a video camera on your head, with a direct feed to the FBI, while wearing a taser necklace to prevent you from doing anything unauthorized.
We cannot give in on this point. If bitcoin ever goes mainstream, people will need it to live a normal life. Obsolete alternatives will atrophy away. If the government has a "kill switch" on your ability to spend money, then it's like if they had a kill switch on your ability to breath. This absolute destruction of privacy that is being contemplated is an obscenity, wrecks the balance between the individual and the State, and we must point it out again and again. The boundary line between the interests of the individual and the interests of the collective must be continuously negotiated, and this kind of thing shackles the individual and destroys all of their leverage in that negotiation. You can expect further stark stratification of our society into the few masters and the many slaves. Do you want to live in a dystopian novel? Because this is how you get into a dystopian novel. Expect your rights to be revoked and your interests to be ignored if we go that route.

That's a perfectly legitimate message, but the way I would phrase it is that the economy might find another way *other than letting the miners do the voting.* In my opinion, this is not a way of thinking about it that needs correcting. To the contrary, the idea that we should not think of the miner signaling as voting because after all they are just a proxy for the desires of the desires of the community is an oversimplification that reduces our ability to understand what is happening.

The difference between firewood and bitcoins is that firewood is ordinarily consumed in a way that is not subject to GST, while bitcoins are ordinarily consumed in a way that is subject to GST. If people did not burn firewood, but rather used it to trade for other goods, then firewood would have a double-taxation problem. This problem would probably kill the use of firewood as money, just as it will kill the use of bitcoin as money in Australia.
If we lived in a world where firewood (or some other consumable product) were used as money, then laws would probably be written differently. For example, the law could say that you pay GST when you buy firewood, but you are exempt from GST when you pay using firewood.
Since bitcoin cannot be consumed for any purpose other than to purchase something, it should be immediately and blatantly obvious that bitcoin should be exempt from GST or VAT.

You got it This is the compromise plan that everyone has been waiting for! Let's tie segwit together with a block size increase!
There is widespread agreement that doubling the capacity to 2MB would be safe. Segwit gets rid of "block size" as a concept and substitutes "block weight", but if we set the max block weight to 4000000 we should be able to achieve a similar throughput. So let's implement segwit with that value.
You know what would be even better? If we could implement your idea in some clever way, where un-upgraded nodes would not get forked off the network. I don't know how we would do that, but I bet that there are some very smart people out there somewhere -- smarter than me and maybe even smarter than you -- who could find some way.

Pretty scary as we are riding the logarithmic dragon. If coins are $100,000 before the next halving event, that burns $2.5 billion dollars in energy per week. On the plus side, that creates a pretty big industry with some clout to cover Bitcoin during the bootstrap stage. If nothing else, it gets the energy companies to have skin in the game, and they are a powerful lobby.

Perhaps not. It might be that segwit is being held hostage simply because it is such a valuable improvement, and the miners think they can get big concessions in exchange for allowing it to activate.

Thank you! I always feel like I'm throwing half-baked ideas into a black hole on this sub so it gets a little discouraging. But I think brainstorming can keep the fire of conversation and creativity lit, and maybe someone will read one of my ideas and it will inspire them to think of an idea that is actually usable. :-P
The "pay miners directly" thing has bee knocking around for a while. For instance I posted about it more than 2 years ago here: 
I have young children so I have no discretionary time, but when I can sneak it in, I plan to code up an implementation of this in python using the stem library to run it as hidden service: 
Something like this, if widely used, would provide a way to anonymously funnel large numbers of transactions to segwit miners.
The mempool issue is something worth thinking about. I suspect the core devs will always want to preserve the condition where previously unseen transactions appearing in blocks will not cause significant disruption. Also bear in mind that these transactions would presumably be present in the mempools of most segwit miners, giving segwit miners an additional advantage when building on segwit blocks.

I think it is not important, unless we're in a situation where the US gov tries to apply KYC to miners. That's the kill shot. Miners are the part of the system that blindly moves value from the control of one person to the control of another person, which is exactly what the authorities would prefer not happen.
If that happens, bitcoin would change character dramatically and perhaps die out pretty quickly. However, some lower-traffic alt-coin could perhaps carry the torch as an anonymous method for transferring value.

I don't see how that follows. OP probably just meant that if segwit had not improved scaling in any way or been pitched as an improvement to scaling, it would not have gotten caught in this political tussle. I think that's likely.


The main thing segwit does is fix 3rd party transaction malleability, which is crucial for building many smart contracts on top of bitcoin. Additionally, segwit hides the witness data from un-upgraded nodes, essentially sneaking a block size increase under their noses. Also, segwit penalizes non-witness data 4 times harder than witness data, because non-witness data is a heavier burden on nodes, and because this encourages people to treat mempool space as the expensive resource it actually is. There are a couple other notable improvements in the segwit release, such as signing input amounts and providing a mechanism for script versioning.

and can keep repeating that the miner signalling is not a vote all they want. The fact is that miners decide whether or not to signal, and signalling decides whether or not the policy goes into effect.
The word 'vote' is normally the word we use to describe this situation, but since we aren't supposed to use that word, I say we use the word 'zote.' Maybe someone can enlighten me on the distinction between voting and zoting.
So the miners have to zote on the proposed soft fork. If 95% of the hash power zotes for the fork, it will activate. Unfortunately, non-miners do not get to zote.

The People to which you are referring have various different reasons. It is my opinion that the thought leaders in that community actually are not motivated to oppose segwit because it is a kludge. Actually, they are motivated to oppose segwit because it does not increase the block size by very much. These people want the block size to remain large enough to keep fees very low, like 1 or 2 cents per transaction. That is going to mean 2 MB, then 4 MB, then 8 MB, then 16 MB, then 32 MB, then 64 MB, etc. Segwit doesn't provide this, so segwit is not a scaling solution in their eyes. They don't want to accept a bump to 1.8 MB, that is a pathetic excuse for scaling.
The whole "kludge" argument emerged later, and I don't find it compelling at all. The way segwit is implemented is not a kludge, and I think the people who go for the kludge argument are either technically incompetent, or lying, or are being fooled by motivated reasoning.

I don't understand why it would be necessary for an ordinary person or business to have a searchable, indexed blockchain. If bitcoin is electronic cash, then the blockchain exists to stop double-spends, not as a more general record of history. It would not normally be considered reasonable to expect accounting software to maintain a searchable index of all of the transactions on the planet, rather than just transactions relevant to your business.
If you are in some kind of niche role that requires a blockchain index, I assume you would just pay the costs to create it. Am I wrong here?

Even though some people do hold this opinion, there appears to me to be widespread (though not universal) agreement that 2MB would be ok, assuming compact blocks, no quadratic hashing, etc.


Limiting your peers makes your node less valuable, but doesn't make it a non-contributor.
Default is 125 peers max. If you cut that to 62 peers would you say you are not really contributing? What if you cut it to 32 peers? It seems to me that anything over 16 peers counts as making a contribution. So I would find the interesting question to be for example, what does the bandwidth vs. peers curve look like?

Yes, there are two separate concepts:
1. You can mark inputs un-spendable after a certain number of blocks (I've heard 50 years proposed.)
2. You could promote additional mining by distributing the un-spendable coins in the block reward, according to some agreed schedule. This would not violate the 21 million coin promise that everyone bought in on, however hopefully this would never be necessary, as transaction fees would provide sufficient mining for security.

It gets harder to make clean distinctions depending on how subtle you want to be. I'm ok with saying that segwit has a *similar* problem.
Compare two scenarios:

Sizeable fraction of other miners say yeah, that's a good thing. Full nodes upgraded to segwit call bullshit. Full nodes not upgraded to segwit go along for the ride. Chain splits. 
2. 95% signal for segwit hard fork. Activation occurs. Uh oh! Major players in the economy were running non-segwit nodes! Chain forks. Poloniex lists both coins. They start trading against each other. Whoops! Minority chain has more than 5% hashrate because 95% was achieved with a little favorable variance. Minority chain actually has 8% hashrate. Majority chain blocks happen every 11 minutes. Minority chain blocks happen every 2 hours. Minority chain emergency hard forks a difficulty adjustment down to 10 minute blocks. Chaos! Cats having sex with dogs! Two Bitcoins now going forward! Each side points finger at other side! and both burned in effigy!

It isn't absolute nonsense. Users can modify the code anytime to whatever they want. That is true but irrelevant. The same could be said for the block reward. Users could set the block reward they prefer, and then have their client accept blocks with a higher reward if a branch that goes above that gets long enough. What is the problem with this? Just giving all the power to the users right? *Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others* right?
The problem is not the change in the code. The problem is the change in user behavior. It is only by banding together and unanimously rejecting a higher block reward or block size that users have any power at all.
As an analogy, consider workers going on strike. You could say "Each worker should be encouraged to decide for themselves whether or not to join the strike. That way they have the most power." The problem is that by exercising that one power, they lose all of their power in the negotiation against management, and their total power is greatly diminished.

The only reason I can think of is that the miners think the core devs are too conservative in what blocksize they will agree to. The miners have a different risk tolerance, and they want to apply pressure to the community (and core devs) to get a larger block size increase than would otherwise happen.
As for the increased runway time, apparently they don't mind waiting if the end result is more favorable. Or maybe they do not appreciate the risks of hard forking to BU or Classic. Maybe they feel confident that they can successfully spend money to crush the minority chain.
I don't have time to work on it right now, but I hope to code up an implementation of an [Anonymous Transaction Relay]( that could safely funnel transactions directly to miners who support segwit, or any other proposal the users care about.

If you are proposing penalizing blocks, and not mining entities, then I guess you don't need to de-anonymize, which is good.
Also it is imperative that a computer can automatically classify blocks as "valid" or "invalid". I am more worried if corruptible human judgement is involved with the classification.


Presumably right now there is some proportion of the blockchain that consists of blocks that contain Finney attacks. There is some proportion of the blockchain that consists of blocks transmitting illegal purchases. Some day there may be some proportion of "non-whitelisted" transactions getting mined. This is a kind of proportional representation. Not everything has as much overwhelming consensus backing it as the 25 BTC rule.
If miners know that, if they mine a certain transaction, then after a suitable period for the wheels of political influence to turn, the other miners will revoke their reward, then it encourages a kind of self-censorship and conservative attitude that in practice I expect would prevent the mining of transactions that the majority doesn't like. Whereas now, the majority must grudgingly accept transactions that they do not like, or risk being left behind in the real-time hash race.

People are not under any obligation to go along with that just because the vote passed. However, the only other option they would have would be to accept it, go down a separate fork, or stop using Bitcoin.


If I were a non-mining user I would feel a little disenfranchised. The thing is, though, that *saying* that miners are not voting wouldn't help me be less disenfranchised.


Our sense for who should be able to vote has expanded over time, but centuries ago in the USA it was normal to assume that only white male land-owners would vote. That is different from the ideal way to vote, but I don't see how that makes it be 'not voting.'


There is weird backroom dealing that goes on in Congress... prior to voting on bills etc. This also is not a persuasive reason to not call something a vote.


I feel like there is a much better analogy for this, but because it is not coming to me, I'll say that this seems a bit like bringing home a dog but framing it as a cat. You tell everyone it's a cat.

It doesn't use the litter box or the cat tree Nothing stops us frome all agreeing to call it a cat. The problem with doing that is that it is not the cleanest way to think about it, and it is blinding you to the true nature of the animal, so things are more confusing than they could be.
Similarly, trying to frame this as 'definitely not voting' when it has many of the same dynamics as voting is not helping. I could be wrong, and this could be a wise move after all, but I don't have the sense that it is helping.


Not every proposal is going to be judged the same from a technical point of view by everyone. And even if there is consensus about the technical worthiness of a change, different groups may be winners or losers in the tradeoffs the change will introduce. This necessarily introduces an element of politics, and it is then important to look around and notice who has the power, and what do people want. It is in this political aspect especially, that thinking of the miner signalling as voting helps.

Edit: The rich have positioned themselves so that the value that other people produce belongs to them (the rich.) They rent people like donkeys, and society is structured with interlocking agreements that prevent anyone from ascending without enriching the people above them on the way up.
I, too, wish that I had so much power that other people who would agree to be my livestock so that they can eat the crumbs off my table, and I can feast on the fruits of their labor.

Miners could be considered a notary service. Is the lawyer that witnesses a contract being signed a money transmitter?
I think the key difference here is that miners have so little control. They do not hold the money and cannot steal it. Pretty much all they can do is decline to include a transaction in a block, but that usually just means the transaction will be in the next block.

This is another example of the kind of misrepresentation that is evidence that you are arguing in bad faith. I said that:


What about that says that Bitcoin cannot succeed? Bitcoin cannot do certain things. It cannot create energy from water. It cannot cure the common cold. It cannot get us to Mars. It cannot scale to global usage. To say that it means Bitcoin cannot succeed is to silently inject your definition of success and pretend I have already agreed to it.
Bitcoin can be successful or can fail at doing the things it has the potential to do. Bitcoin cannot scale to global usage while retaining it's independence from the legal system, which is the only reason for giving it the expensive architecture it has, and which allows it to be a neutral, censorship resistant bulwark against meddling by rent-seeking folks and officials who are greedy for too much power.

No, it can't, because after a short time only one of the chains will have more work, and both chains will look valid to unupgraded nodes, so nodes will switch to the heavier chain. At least that is how I understand it.
 
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:54:00




There is a certain kind of sense it doesn't make. Specifically, it doesn't make sense as any kind of action recommendation or wish for an alternate history, because as you say it is impossible for segwit to have been implemented in a way that does not increase the number of transactions per second Bitcoin can process.
There are a couple of ways it can make sense however.
It could be taken as a sort of wistful thought experiment on a hypothetical but impossible situation, as a way to emphasize an ironic aspect of the opposition to segwit. That is to say that the people who oppose segwit activation say they want more throughput. The irony is that segwit gives them more throughput, which they say they want, yet they oppose segwit. Furthermore, if segwit did not increase throughput it would not have entered the contentious scaling conversation and would have probably been deployed without resistance.
Secondly, if you restrict the conversation in way that I find unhelpful, but which is nevertheless very common, and ignore lightning, schnorr and MAST and simply focus on vanilla on-chain transactions, it would actually be possible to implement segwit in a way that doesn't increase the throughput at all. Specifically, you could make a rule that says that the sum of the segwit and the nonwit must be less than or equal to 1 megabyte per block.
A proposal like that might be what the OP had in mind, and perhaps would have been less contentious. However, such a proposal would have been problematic for other reasons.


Hiding the witness data from un-upgraded nodes is how the block size is accomplished as a soft fork. The weighting issue is not where the hiding comes from.
For example, you could choose to weight segwit and nonwit exactly equally. Unupgraded nodes would see &lt;= 1 MB full of nonwit data and would be oblivious to the segwit data. Upgraded nodes would see &lt;= 1MB of nonwit data and (let's say) &lt;= 1MB of segwit data. It's better to penalize nonwit because it is more burdensome, but there is nothing mandatory about that design choice.

Agreed. I am not saying that the state is correct or morally praiseworthy. I just find it counter-productive when people refer to taxation as theft instead of as taxation. What tends to happen is that they lump unjust taxation that does not have adequate force of consensus behind it, with reasonable taxation that people by and large are ok with paying.
Calling it "theft" is a cheap rhetorical trick which attempts to win the argument by simply defining taxation as evil. It is also an absolutist position, and encourages the thinker to ignore information in favor of gobbling up opinions that have been digested for them by other people.

I had a really positive impression of Gavin 4 years ago. He seemed like a benign, humble shepherd for Bitcoin. He seemed to have good instincts. Over time my impression has changed considerably. More and more he seems to be in the best case scenario too naive. He talks about trusting miners and trusting governments. I think concepts like "trust" and "faith" are inferior ways to think about risk, and are most ardently promoted by con artists.
When Gavin says "I trust the miners not to harm bitcoin" what I translate that to is "I am willing to accept the risk that miners will harm bitcoin." That has different emotional consequences for how we think about it. Less mammalian brain. More frontal cortex. When you say "I trust them" you tend to let your guard down. When you say "I accept the risk" you are more likely to continue monitoring the risk and working to reduce it. You keep the possibility that "they will screw me when conditions are right" alive in your mind. The problem is not whether we trust Jihan Wu to hold a kill switch for Bitcoin's decentralization and not use it. The problem is that Bitcon's value proposition is that no small party has such a kill switch.
I don't see why I would ever want to use trust. There are other ways to think about the problem, and trust damages your objectivity and greatly increases the chances of getting fooled.
Gavin has done several things that bend me toward thinking he is potentially not just naive. It's not compelling evidence, but the needlessly aggressive blocksize increase in Bitcoin-XT, the Craig Wright thing, the "gee shucks what are you talking about" gaslighting when people raise reasonable concerns about his statements. I don't feel confident anymore that Gavin is fully honest about his analysis and motives. Gavin talks about trust, and he wants us to trust him. He seems like a nice person, but you gotta keep the possibility that "he will screw you when conditions are right" alive in your mind.

@_date: 2017-02-27 18:14:11


"Practically free" is hyperbole, especially since everyone is simultaneously complaining that segwit will not do much for the terribly high fees we are all paying. "Extra stuff" is also hyperbole, since all transactions contain witness data, so it would not be extra. If we are talking about specially crafted attacks, we should be discussing the 4000000 max block weight cap, not the expected increase in throughput under typical usage which would approximate a 1.7 MB block.


Probably no one has answered you because it isn't the right question to ask. The right question is "how much of the typical usage is witness data?" not "How much of this particular transaction is witness data." The answer to that question is in the chart I linked -- more than half is witness data. The fully digested factoid you are looking for is 1.7 MB blocks, which has been widely cited and is the answer to the question which gives the insight that your question will not.


Assuming 1 TB monthly data per 1MB block size, that is the equivalent of watching more than 6 months of high definition video every day.
Why would Comcast deploy this technology? This is kind of like saying that you expect that in 10 years Toyota will be selling cars with 20,000 horsepower, or Apple is going to start selling phones with 60,000 pixels per inch. Technological trend lines flatten out when the technology is good enough. Companies do not usually sell products with thousands of more times more power than what their normal customers need, because it is a waste of money.


That is a fair point. It's a complex interaction. More people -&gt; More nodes. More bandwidth -&gt; less nodes. More people -&gt; more bandwidth. More bandwidth -&gt; More people.

Again with the exaggeration. It doesn't facilitate productive conversation. Nobody is saying that we won't see any tech improvements or reduction in cost over 10 years.
If you want to increase the bandwidth requirement, I think it is up to you to demonstrate that it does not jeopardize what makes Bitcoin a worthwhile project. And no, saying "Well if you think that technology is going to grind to a halt then we are going to disagree" does not go very far in demonstrating that ordinary internet service is going to comfortably allow customers to watch 1000 movies at the same time 24 hours per day every day within 10 years.
It doesn't make me some kind of Thomas Watson to observe that technological progress in the consumer space is driven by consumer demand. What consumers demand is the equivalent of watching several hours of high definition TV per day. The human nervous system is the bottleneck here. Just like with cell phone pixels there is not much point in going past 500 PPI, and with bicycles there is not much point in building the frame to support more than a ton of force. Could we build phones with 1000 PPI and bicycles that could support a pickup truck?

Segwit IS the compromise. It provides a block size increase, even though small block hardliners like luke-jr and petertodd think it is dangerous. The other side just put the concession in their pocket, said that's nice but now instead of 2MB blocks we demand unlimited blocks.  
Segwit also avoids a hard fork, and enables lightning, shnorr and MAST, all of which increase the TTPS (trustless transactions per second)

I'm not sure that is what they are saying.

They are trying to blind someone to the power that the miners have in the current context. Maybe they are trying to blind themselves. Maybe they are trying to blind the miners. Maybe by fostering this interpretation they are trying to prepare the way for popular outrage if the miners exercise this power.

I think the distinction you are trying to make is worthwhile, but I wish there were some other way to make it. First of all, the 'signal' *is* binding in one direction. If the miners signal to accept, segwit will be deployed. A miner decision to veto is less binding of course, but as a point of comparison -- Congress can vote to reject a bill, and the bill can be rewritten and resubmitted for a new vote. So does Congress never vote? Americans voted against Hillary Clinton in 2008, yet she ran again in 2016... therefore the 2008 action was non-binding and therefore not a vote?


Users do not have any good options for overruling the miners that I am aware of. If you are talking about changing the POW then I have to notice it is a risky, expensive and difficult-to-coordinate strategy that may not work. For one, the hard fork could fail to gain consensus. For another, even if the POW changes, large miners are arguably the best positioned people to quickly deploy hardware that executes the new POW -- and they would see it coming from a mile away during the consensus building phase, so it is hard to be confident that there would be any interruption in their control.
More extreme alternatives (e.g. POS) exist but getting consensus behind them would be even more difficult than switching to a new POW. Personally I would like to see POS get added to Bitcoin in such a way that you use POS to somehow purchase a 'hunting license' to try to mine certain blocks, but I haven't seen a lot of hybrid POW/POS systems in the wild, and the algorithm for retargeting POW and POS when both are in play is unclear to me.
@_date: 2017-02-13 15:47:21
Because when that date passes, nothing important about segwit's status will have changed.
Version bits automatically expire after a year to coordinate the end of a soft fork attempt. It doesn't mean that the soft fork attempt must end on that date.
If we haven't activated segwit by that day, you can bet that the same version bit or some other bit will start signaling for segwit. If you want to call it a due date for something, I guess you could say it's a due date for the 0.13.1 implementation of segwit.
Edit: Due date, not deadline

You're right -- I went back and edited.
I don't want to get hung up on semantics, but I do want to emphasize a couple of points:
1. The "timeout" is a feature of the activation signal for segwit. It is not a feature of segwit. 
2. The "timeout" is self imposed. It was wise to pick a timeout date for coordination purposes, but if we get close to the timeout and nodes still want to give miners the option to signal for segwit, we just pick a new timeout.
Your point that if the timeout expires the segwit proposal will be modified is better support for calling it a due date for segwit, but that assertion needs support.
As a general rule, it does make sense to try something else if enough time passes and what you are trying isn't working, but I feel pretty confident in guessing that some implementation of segwit will make it into Bitcoin even if it hasn't happened by November. Segwit is generally regarded as a good fix for transaction malleability, and the core devs are very excited about it.

I think they should. It is a diaster for ATM machines to keep pumping money into a stolen address. You could do it with the blockchain but it would require a fork, plus all the bloat. It could be incorporated into the payment protocol instead.
Probably should be using a payment handshake of some kind anyway rather than blindly lobbing btc at an address.

Although I would prefer to be reassured that the blockchain is inviolable due to the laws of physics, I think POW will rather defend the ledger against petty vandalism, make fraudulent transactions impractical and ensure that actual attacks will be small enough in number that they can be successfully elevated to the consciousness of the community and resolved politically.
Furthermore, I have proposed that people vote with their coins on the appropriate inflation rate. I would be ok with paying up to 1% per year if transaction fees weren't cutting it -- especially if part of that was being soaked up in real terms by lost or destroyed coins.

Could the principle be the same? Bitcoin would act as an SPV client to the sidechain and would release locked funds when the transaction was buried under a suitable amount of PoS blocks.
A couple of twists come to mind to avoid confabulation of the history by prominent early stake holders:
1. The coins could only be released to a chain that matched the history of the chain into which the coins were issued.
2. Stake holders could include people who hold bitcoins on the main chain, not just people who hold tokens on the side chain.
3. Commitments could be made to the Bitcoin blockchain to provide proof that the chain has existed for a certain period of time.
Maybe the best answer would be to say that if we are serious about using this to buttress Bitcoin, then the soft fork enabling the creation of the side chain makes Bitcoin nodes fully validate this side chain. Remember that this side chain could be quite small and we still get the benefits. It just needs to be big enough to have enough transaction fees to entice stake holders into participating.
My vision is for Bitcoin to be a brute fact about human society that no-one thinks there is any practical way to dislodge. If we are going to make the block size larger, we may as well ask for security with heterogeneous layers in the bargain.
Pitching this to bitmain would be enjoyable -- "Hey Bitmain! We're going to raise the block size! But you won't be able to collect any of the additional transaction fees, and PoW miners will have less power of what chain is extended, or what transactions are mined. But you're cool with that because it's good for Bitcoin, right?"

One problem, which pointed out, is that if bitcoin is inflationary, people might prefer to store their wealth in a counterparty-like token that uses the bitcoin blockchain but does not inflate.
Because of this parasite token, the market cap of Bitcoin would be correspondingly smaller, thus the inflation rate would need to be higher to achieve your 1T goal, which would result in more people using the parasite token. Hypothetically, this positive feedback loop could result in a situation where no one uses Bitcoin as a store of value, but more like a postage stamp that you buy to send a transaction in the parasite currency. This would mean a very small market cap, and you basically have to pay for most of your security with transaction fees once again.

Then make the grace period longer. If activation occurs and full nodes allow 90 days before they start enforcing, then false signalling miners have time to clean up their act.

It also supports sending over tor, so you don't have to reveal your IP address when sending your transactions.

Bitcoin the payment rail can never handle all of the worlds transactions. That much should be obvious.
Can Bitcoin the "unit of account" become the world reserve currency? Possibly, though I expect it will always be more volatile than the leading government issued currency, which makes it undesirable as a unit of account.
I think it has a reasonable chance of becoming a global store of wealth to rival the dollar, but I think the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions will occur off chain, as they have for a long time.

This is as good as it gets. There is no known way for miners to cryptographically prove that they have validated a block. And if there were such a technique, it would not be useful, because if you prove that they have validated a block, you have proved that the block is valid. If you have proved that the block is valid, you no longer care whether or not the miner validated the block.

Again, I can't really criticize the paper, or even understand it at the moment, but I am reminded of something that happened at work recently. The plan was to siphon some water into a tube. No big deal. To my astonishment, however, the siphon just sat there and no water flowed into the tube. At a high level, it sounds great. You understand how siphons work, you expect the water to flow into the tube. But this tube was fairly thin and about 100 feet long, so friction completely stopped the siphon effect from happening. I was standing there holding my end of the tube 10 feet in the air, and nothing was coming out the other side. It was like a watery rope trick.
Now if you come to me and tell me about how siphons work and what to expect, then that's high-level and that sounds reasonable, and I'll say "yeah maybe."
If you come to me with fluid dynamics equations, and materials science, and table compiled from experimental data, and finite element simulations etc. then that's low level stuff that is more like what engineers rely on to build systems.

Yes, or as I might say, one feature of ISM/BIP9 is that miners vote for the soft fork.


I'm a little fuzzy here, but I don't think nodes can do a soft fork in the same way that miners can. The reason miners can do a soft fork safely is that a majority of miners can starve a non-conforming chain by refusing to build on it, resulting in unupgraded nodes getting pulled onto the soft fork by the weight of the work. Nodes do not have this power, so if miners continue building on an 'invalid' chain from the perspective of the nodes attempting the soft fork, a hard fork results between upgraded an un-upgraded nodes. This is not what I would call a good option -- especially if the majority hashpower devotes some power to sabotage the soft fork chain by mining empty blocks on it. Which, rumor has it, they are prepared to do.

I see your point, but for the sake of argument...
When deciding whether an industry is highly regulated or not, one should evaluate the entire industry vertically, not just the last mile installation, and score the amount of regulation some how, and compare that score to similar industries in other government jurisdictions.
It is no good in this conversation comparing the ISP industry to, say, the ice cream truck industry, and concluding that the United States highly regulates ISPs. Also, it is no good comparing the ISP industry to the hypothetical "ideal" situation of the government making no rules at all and allowing everyone to string fiber anywhere they want. Both of those are pretty useless meanings for the term "highly regulated" in my opinion.
I think the best strategy I have heard, as far as ISPs go, is to provide municipal fiber that can get attached to whatever provider the user prefers.

His opinions do not appear to have changed.
I think cheaper transaction fees (larger blocks) will make Bitcoin cheaper to use, and therefore find more uses, and therefore result in greater mining reward overall (see [Jevons Paradox]( and that is good for bitcoin. On the other hand, you want to enable anonymous mining so that Bitcoin is censorship-resistant.

As for whether words are our masters or our slaves, I think there is a big potential to talk past each other based on ambiguity in the word "words". In one sense, your words are a big part of what constitutes "you." In another sense, however, it is important to realize that concepts can be modified or discarded if they are not useful, and the concept a word can point to can be changed so that a word points to a more appropriate concept.

This is a very interesting calculation, but the label "valuing bitcoin" doesn't appear to apply to it. When I think of the "value of bitcoin" the first definition that comes to mind is the value of a bitcoin. You could express *that* in joules you want to, but it would be a different calculation than the one you are doing. Alternatively, it could mean the value of all of the bitcoins that have been mined.
The calculation you are doing is more like the value of mining a block. It might be interesting to compute that two different ways -- first by doing the hash to joules calculation, second by figuring out how much energy the block reward could purchase in various locations. I would bet that the second number would be lower than the first number.
Maybe what you mean is that you figure out the energy consumed to build the block and divide that by the block reward to get the joules per bitcoin?

I can take what I dish out. Feel free to correct me when you see me exaggerating.


That diminishing return is what makes my other analogies apply exactly. I expect the same thing to happen to internet bandwidth, for exactly that reason. Once ordinary internet service can satisfy the sensory demands of the ordinary human beings who are using it, you had better bet that bandwidth will stop dramatically increasing. Most users of the internet are not bitcoin miners, so your argument that there is no diminishing return does not work for most users. They (and all full node operators) will need specialized internet service, which is what you challenged me to show. Specialized stuff cost more than mass-produced stuff -- usually way more.

Then there is the meta question of how do you decide to modify the coin vote score mechanism if it starts to look like it's leading to bad outcomes that benefit some handful of people. With a coin vote?
Coinvoting provides hard-to-fake information about what people want, and that is perhaps valuable to have -- but Bitcoin is an extremely different beast than how we think about governance. There is no "President of Bitcoin" who can look at the coin voting results and pull the lever to do something as a result. Inputs have to be wired directly to outputs. When Gavin says "I'll put forward a proposal, and if it doesn't gain traction, I'll just throw my weight around" as he did wrt the block size increase, or when Charlie Lee says that "we'll do a POW change if necessary" they are thinking about it like they are in charge. They aren't in charge. Nobody is in charge. Even though Pieter Wuille -- probably the most respected developer in Bitcoin -- merges segwit, which is widely applauded as a great technical leap forward, here we are stalled out 3 months later, with a path to deploy segwit unclear. No single party is able to call the shots, which I find really fascinating. Bitcoin is in charge of itself to a degree you don't often see in designed systems. It's much more like a government with no president, using cryptography and economics to make things impossible rather than using force to make things illegal than an engineering project.

Everything about bitcoin requires miner consensus, and soft forks only require 51% consensus in order to succeed, although that would be ugly.

It raises it by 50%-80%. Even more for the complex transactions layer 2 solutions are going to tend to use. Whether it's 'barely a dent' or is pointless to argue about. If you think that segwit barely makes a dent then it seems likely that the block size you have in mind would make a full node require a business class internet connection. Have you looked at the posts people have made measuring their full node bandwidth requirements? 1 MB blocks translates to something like a terabyte per month. That isn't a big problem, but just notice that you have to multiply any change you make to the blocksize by about a *million* to get the monthly impact. Bitcoin blocks are NOT like web pages. They constantly keep coming, whether you are sleeping or waking, and requests for copies keep coming in from peers around the clock.

For a soft fork there is only one likely failure mode -- the one you are describing, where signalling is insufficient and nothing happens.
For a hard fork there is the additional failure mode where although miners do signal 95% hashrate and segwit activate, there is a significant portion of the community who don't want segwit and are running BU, Classic or XT and the chain splits. Sorry if I wasn't communicating well, but that is the failure mode to which I am referring.

In this example, if you have not validated in 30 seconds, you stop mining the block. If you determine that the block is invalid, you also stop mining it.
"Validationless" mining would mean that you mine without validating -- you just assume that invalid blocks will not get created. This is what caused some miners to wander off on an invalid chain for 6 blocks in July.
Edit: When segwit comes along, this method could maybe be modified to say something like "Stop mining if you do not receive the non-witness within 15 seconds. Stop mining if you do not validate within 30 seconds.

One confirmation comes. Two confirmations come. The bitcoin seller starts flicking his eyes nervously at the door and drains his coffee cup. "Can I go now?" he asks... "You can see we have 2 confirmations..."

But your client thinks that anyone can spend these transactions, which is clearly false. Seems like we need a special definition of "trick" to use here now.
If anyone sends you a payment, you cannot tell whether or not you can spend it. And if you want to send anyone a payment, you have to make it ANYONE_CAN_PAY but your client does not know how to form the segregated witness, so anyone can steal the money.
So basically you don't have to upgrade, so long as you are willing to stop using Bitcoin...

Control over the definition of words is quite obviously the source of great political power. Words are the labels we give to the conceptual programs running in our minds. Minds are connected to muscles through nerve fibers. Muscles are connected to ATP, which is connected to glucose, which is connected to solar energy, which is connected to nuclear fusion of hydrogen.
In the end, words obtain power by virtue of an asymmetry in time wherein on one end the universe is in a highly unlikely state and on the other end the universe is a highly likely state. In the transformation from unlikely to likely we are able to harness energy, which is residual unlikliness that can be transformed into some other unlikely condition that we find conducive to our goals.


Yes. Diffusion of power is a good thing. I encourage you to make your own tentative definition rather than submit to Gavin's or mine.


Agreed, but nailing down definitions can be a serious impediment to understanding the nature of a thing, especially a new thing. It is better to keep an open mind about what conceptual models are going to be helpful. Gavin is not making an attempt to understand, he is making an attempt to influence a technical conversation by seizing control of the conceptual tooling.

If you are hashing on blocks that you have not validated yet, then this is clearly the wrong behavior. At a minimum, it is in everyone's best interest (especially the miner's) to immediately abandon any chain they know to be invalid.
1. Miners could abandon a chain after T seconds if they have not validated all blocks prior to the one they are mining (T = 30 in Gavin's proposal)
2. Miners could abandon a chain if they have not acquired and validated a block X (X = current block minus 4 in my suggestion, but more conservative might be better)

Suppose the Chinese government had been working for the last 2 years, and has discovered a single block, containing the genesis hash, which has more POW than the entire current blockchain.

I agree with you. Generally, when I hear people accuse the other point of view as being "ridiculous" or "silly" that is a big red flag. If the speaker feels the need to help you view the opposition's views as silly, usually it means that the speaker is using sophistry to distract you from the fact that a reasonable person could actually agree with the opposition. Besides all that, plenty of things which appear silly at first turn out to be true, so even if the opposition's viewpoint is silly, it doesn't reliably indicate that they are wrong.
In fact, my rule of thumb is that when someone's ideas are decried as "silly" I try to take those ideas even more seriously.
Also, refusing to get your kid vaccinated is selfish, arrogant, and/or shows that you lack the skills to evaluate evidence in a way that leads to correct predictions. (Totally not using sophistry here.)

You do realize that bitcoin miners burn like $500 million per year in electricity, right? You could launch a new satellite every few months for what Bitcoin spends on security.

Sorry Gavin, Nakamoto consensus means the longest *valid* chain wins.

I think the core devs have demonstrated over the years that they want Bitcoin to be very successful and to do as much good in the world as it can do. To me they appear to care primarily about making the essential functions of the Bitcoin protocol stable and reliable. That itself is a big enough challenge, as Bitcoin is a target for many adversaries.
If people want features, let them submit pull requests, or create their own projects. If miners feel that Bitcoin is lacking some solution, and if they have Bitcoin's best interest at heart, then let them pay developers to create such a solution. We don't need to beg the core developers to create things that are low on thier priority list.
To say that their interest is in science and technology does not persuade me of anything. There are dozens of people who submit to core. Furthermore, there are thousands of other people on the fringe with various backgrounds. One of them put lightning forward as an idea. One of them put tumblebit forward. One of them put Mimblewimble. Core devs grab the stuff that makes sense and use it if they can. If an economist makes a case for something, everyone is listening. If the case is persuasive or the economic community is of one mind, then perhaps it will be adopted. Anyway, economists are generally Keynsian and against deflationary currencies, so if you go by them generally you should recommend that Bitcoin's inflation curve be managed by a central bank.
This idea that the devs are paid by some shady business and that it is reasonable to suspect a conflict of interest -- well go ahead and show me what actions they have taken and explain how they are evidence of a conflict of interest. They have suggested we keep the capacity constrained and that there be a second layer. I think their arguments are persuasive.
Miners interests are not perfectly aligned with the interests of users, and in fact there is a very dangerous misalignment in the fact that individual miners want to get a larger share of the hash rate, and users want individual miners to have a smaller share. Furthermore, large miners want miners to have more power, and user want users to have more power. Miners do not need users validating the blockchain. They can just tell users with their hash power which blocks are valid. Miners can possibly tolerate much larger blocks than users can tolerate. These are all easily observable conflicts between what is good for miners and what is good for users. Furthermore, what BU recommends is not that miners code something up and we shall all decide whether to accept their proposal. No, BU suggests that miner can at any moment start producing larger and larger blocks, and tier by tier users will be dragged onto the chain.
Segwit is a great solution that kills several birds with one stone and makes very rational decisions about the incentives which support a protocol that is strong and stable. There may not be consensus on this future, but consensus is less critical for a soft fork than for a hard fork, because it is far less likely to split the network. This vision has not been rammed through, and in fact as it is currently implemented, it cannot activate without 95% of the hash power behind it. The non-consenting faction of Bitcoin has effectively stalled it for now.
I trust miners sufficiently to carefully consider whatever software they publish, and based on the merits of that software I will run it or not. I trust bitmain's software, and I run it on my mining hardware. No problem. As far as I know, the miners have mainly backed BU, which frankly gives me a very good reason to not trust them in the future.
Bitcoin unlimited doesn't suggest to fork right away. Tell me, when does it suggest to fork? The answer is, that BU doesn't say when to fork. BU says that the miners should fork when in their judgement it's a good time to fork. See that's the kind of power I think it is not appropraite to award to miners.
I appreciate that you would be happy with a 2MBhard fork, but right now what is on offer is a ~2MB soft fork. Soft forks are safer than hard forks, so I suggest that you agree to the offer, or create your own patched client embodying your compromise and offer it to the community, as the core team has done. It is not necessarily their job to code up your proposal.
The technical debt caused by segwit is insignificant in comparison to the added safety bought by deploying it as a soft fork. Bitcoin is not like other projects. You have to consider deployment carefully in the equation about how to make changes. It is unreasonable to expect to be able to change the protocol in exactly the same ways you might if you were just doing it for your company web page. Furthermore, I have not heard anyone articulate important downsides of the soft fork implementation of segwit as it differs from the hard fork implementation other than to say that it is not identical and to repeat the words "technical debt". Just because you do something slightly diifferently or with a few more lines of code does not make it technical debt worth worrying about.
Upgrades via hard forks may be necessary in the future, or perhaps not. Some have argued that we will never actually need to do any hard forks, and I think that may be true.

I'm thinking of using the spacecraft as a way to notarize a high-bandwidth sidechain that would execute most bitcoin transactions.
In that scenario, if there are not enough transaction fees to pay for a spacecraft, then that means there is probably not enough demand to support a half-billion dollar per year mining network either.
Furthermore, if the plan got off the ground, it could be a proof of concept for replacing mining all together with something far cheaper.

You should not be so condescending, and you are wrong again in asserting that I have not read the white paper. Don't you get tired of being wrong? Or do you just never notice? Or you don't care about the truth?
I did not say anything about how Satoshi designed Bitcoin. What I implied is that less than 1% of the users of bitcoin control the majority of the hashpower, and therefore proof-of-work *cannot* 'solve the problem' of determining representation in majority decision making. Proof-of-work puts the decisions in the hands of a tiny minority, not in the hands of the majority. It would be more accurate to say that "The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in decision making, by taking representation away from the majority and giving it to 3 or 4 leaders of major mining pools." But even that would be inaccurate, as other participants in the economy wield power by deciding when to buy and sell.
I'm not saying that the statement is not in the white paper. I'm saying that with the benefit of 9 years of empirical data we can see that the statement is clearly false. What persuasive power is there in quoting false statements even if they were written in the white paper?

Not sure exactly how that relates and too lazy to re-read the wiki, but basically as you get more and more work out of a resource, demand goes up not down because suddenly it's economical to do all kinds of other stuff with the resource. So if you make the blocks bigger, the amount in transaction fees goes UP because more people make more transactions, instead of DOWN because the available supply of block space went up.

The question I want to ask is "who is willing to pay for security." To me, that is the question relevant to making a coin that actually works properly, reliably and sustainably.


So if I am a Coinbase customer, and I pay another Coinbase customer in Bitcoin, then... what? I should fund mining somehow? That is why the question of "should" is less relevant here. Rather, how can we arrange the system so that people are willing to pay, because it is the only way to accomplish the thing they want?
 


This case is so extreme that it loses aspects of the problem which are relevant to deciding what to do. The fact of the matter is that in order to be a valuable currency, it must remain possible to spend Bitcon. That takes mining. And that takes money. If no one is transacting, and savers refuse to pony up the money in the form of inflation, then the empty blocks being mined will be very low POW. Consequently when the day comes that they finally *do* want to spend some Bitcoin, there will be no secure way to do it. As a result, the currency will not have the critical properties that give it value, and the real value of their savings will be destroyed. Which they do care about. So they are willing to pay I bet.

I disagree with this. If &gt;50% of the miners started mining 10MB blocks tomorrow, the entire rest of the network would simply ignore these blocks, and follow the chain being produced by the mining minority. That is what makes this a hard fork. By contrast, if &gt;50% of the miners started mining 500KB blocks tomorrow, the rest of the network would continue using the chain they are producing. That is what makes this a soft fork.

So what I hear you saying, is that Bitcoin can compete just fine against another coin that has a lower inflation rate? In other words, Bitcoin's network effect does not depend on it having the best inflation rate, right?
As for what security aspect would require inflation to operate -- my position just takes that as a given. If inflation is not required for security, I think the case for inflation is far more difficult to make.
But since you asked, I'll give you an example. Let's say perhaps that due to very efficient layer 2 protocols, very few transactions are done on-chain, and there is not enough revenue to buy good security.
Another example -- let's say that miners find that with no inflation subsidy there is no reason to hash for the first 1 minute a block arrives. This is because the mempool is not sufficiiently enriched with transactions offering relatively higher fees during that period. Let's say this created an undesirable situation, where hashpower could be cheaply purchased by attackers wishing to undo some transaction that made it into the prior block.
One more observation -- we have never seen what happens to mining when the inflation rate is down below 1%, so we should be cautious and keep an open mind. Maybe it performs just fine. Maybe not. We can make informed predictions, but we won't really know for sure until we get there.

Depends on how large blocks get. At about 10 MB blocks, I think that there is considerable risk that almost all normal users would stop running full nodes. Only miners and exchanges would remain. Users are not going to want to buy a special internet connection just to run a full node. Most busineses would find running a full node to be a pointless added expense. And exchanges already follow KYC regulations.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:48:08
Or not. Since the difficulty on the 8% chain will fall dramatically, but the reward remains roughly the same, miners may find it profitable to stay on the minority chain. Depends on the price difference between the two tokens.
If you were a miner, would you want to switch to a chain with a much higher difficulty but the same payout?

Me too. He has proposed making miners prove that they have the entire previous block before they started hashing. I think that is a bad idea as I posted [here](
Whatever the yet unarticulated risks of head first mining are, they must be weighed against the grave risk that comes with giving the miner of the last block a huge head start.
@_date: 2016-03-18 02:58:24
I don't understand what you mean by "shuts down the entire honest mining indefinitely" but a while ago I [posted a suggestion]( to force miners to provide evidence that they have the whole block that was mined 4 blocks before the one they are currently mining. I think that plus Gavin's 30s rule would be very solid.
In that post I argued that if you force miners to validate the previous block, , as Peter proposed, then the rational move for most miners is to outsource the validation job experts who specialize in having low latency connections and the ability to validate quickly.
Getting miners to be honest is going to come down to eliminating any profit that can be obtained by skipping validation, and by setting it up so that miners who end up on the wrong chain are mining worthless coins.

Bitcoin should be willing to use inflation to achieve security. In fact, Bitcoin *does* use inflation to achieve security, and will inflate for the rest of our lives. The question is what the inflation curve should look like, and I would accept a perpetual inflation rate below 1% if it were necessary to secure the network. A stake weighted vote could determine how much inflation HODLers think they should pay.
In fact, and this is probably anathama to this community, I think that a store of value with a small (e.g. 1%) inflation rate may actually result in a better society than a non-inflating store ov value, beause it could result in smaller wealth inequality, and encourage people to take more risks with their wealth to seek a better return, which can put people to work building things that are of in aggregate valuable.
The major flaw with Peter's analysis here, in my opinion, is that the equilibrium point he speaks probably produces bigger blocks than an ordinary consumer internet connection would support, which unacceptably harms decentralization.   
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:28:36
There is an unstated assumption in my argument. I'm assuming that to consider the fork "successful" the rest of the network continues to recognize and use the chain you are building.
In a "soft" fork, the majority hashpower does not need the rest of the network to make modifications to their nodes. In fact, the rest of the network could theoretically not even notice that a soft fork has occurred.
By contrast, if you hard fork without anyone's consent, then they will presumably not modify their node software, and as a result, the rest of the network will not follow the chain that you are generating.

If you want big blocks, you need to keep transaction fees low so that people will make lots of transactions. If you keep transaction fees low, spam attacks are cheaper to accomplish. There is no magic 'criteria' that will allow you to automatically filter out spam. Other than raising the cost of transactions. By capping the block size. Which miners have not shown that they are able to do without a node enforced limit. Miners blew through all of the default soft limits (e.g. 250k and 750k) as soon as sustained demand hit them. BU basically means that there is no more hard limit (hence the 'Unlimited' in the name) so we would be justified in expecting miners to continue raising the block size whenever it is hit.
To sum up, the end game of BU is that everyone who uses BU will be completely trusting the miners to validate the blockchain. Even if you spend the money to run your own full node, and you detect an invalid block -- who cares if everyone else in the economy accepts it? Why would you even bother? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:31:33
I am making the implicit assumption that the level of support for BU among SPV users is less than 100%. That is a defensible assumption.
Remember, without block size detection, 100% of SPV clients will follow the chain with the most hash power, which is likely to be BU, at least at first.
Also, the users who do not express a strong preference will probably just follow the defaults their wallet provides. If, for example, Multibit were to implement this idea, and default to the Core chain, then any Multibit people without a strong preference would just follow along. Otherwise, they would all become BU users until they abandon their SPV wallet and switch to a full node, which they may be reluctant to do.
I think that it's pretty clear to see that this feature will significantly impact how much of the ecosystem BU can easily pull along for the hard fork.  
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:13:20
It's just a question of how you define good and bad.
If I decided to come into your city and convinced the local officials to sell me the city park, and then I ripped out the playground and trees and turned it into a huge smelly landfill -- I guess you could say that is my perrogative and just the way things work.
Alternatively you could say it resulted in a worse world to live in, and can validly by characterized as an attack on what makes the city a nice city and should be resisted by the city dwellers.
I would say that situations like this is why we have the concept of 'attacking'. I mean, when a wolf chases a bunny and eats it, is it 'attacking' the bunny, or just having dinner? 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:26:21
It's no problem for SPV users, but for BU users who want to validate the BU blockchain, they will find that it takes more and more bandwidth to do so. Currently, a full node at 1MB blocks and the default peer settings consumes more data than 99% of internet users in the USA. Your ISP might have something to say about it if you are consuming 10 terabytes per month because of a (cheap to launch, because hey blocks should always be large enough to not be full right?) dust spam attack from unethical vandals loyal to Core. Also, your internet is going to be sluggish if you want to play games or stream movies.
It mainly means that more BU full nodes will drop out and be replaced by SPV nodes. Which will put more bandwidth pressure on the remaining BU nodes to serve the SPV node requests.
But that's ok, since BU people say that the chain with the greatest work is the valid chain by definition. Based on that definition, you actually don't need to run a full node at all, because any time your full node disagrees with the longest chain, your node is wrong by definition. So the only people who need to run full nodes are miners. Not even all miners actually. Just the set of miners who together make up more than 50% of the hash rate. No one else's full node has any impact, so small fish miners can safely be more profitable by eliminating the wasteful expense of running a full node.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:00:34


Those sound like reasonalbe arguments.


I have confidence in the developers in aggregate, because they have produced a lot of great code, and although their intentions cannot be completely known, I feel like they can be adequately guessed at.
Also, the amount of trust I need to place in the developers is quite limited. It is an open source project. The developers can only write code, they cannot run it for everyone, without everyone agreeing. All of those individual decisions to accept a change are an important safeguard. Finally, I agree with the developers. People should be able to run a full node on their home internet connection. 2MB blocks is fine. 4 MB blocks is pushing it. 8 MB blocks may not be ok. Let's start with 2 MB and then collect more data, and then proceed to 4 MB if it looks safe.


Yes. And the best way to do it is with a soft fork. Which is why I support segwit.


One way to do it is to try to predict how many significant chains will exist after the fork. If you predict that there will be 2 significant chains, as I do, then there is not consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:48:56

@_date: 2017-03-22 13:59:48


Again, this should not be done in the absence of overwhelming consensus. The only circumstance that would trigger a POW chain is if miners start attacking by mining empty blocks or reorganizing the chain. If that happens, it will be change the POW or die, and I think people will rather change the POW than die.


I don't think it's a good idea to set a precedent where miners threaten us and we agree to make the block size larger. Also, I think the 1MB block size is fine for now. Block space needs to be constrained to cause people to pay transaction fees, and we need to start working on the layer 2 structures that Bitcoin requires to safely scale up.

Yes this is correct of course. I am not making a moral judgement when I say is is abnormal. I am just observing that  only a small minority run full nodes, and the people who don't care very much are already not running full nodes. The people who run full nodes care more than normal.

No, this is more like saying "SPV wallet users should be able to choose which chain their wallet follows. If they want a wallet that follows the BU chain, they can choose that. If they want a wallet that follows the legacy consensus rules, they can choose that."

Rather, people are basically arguing that by taking the risk of buying bitcoins, or investing time and energy in the project, everyone is signaling that they agree with the 21M cap. That is simply not true. For example, I have done those things, and I think the 21M cap is stupid. If you are so confident that everyone has "bought in" to this social contract, there should be no problem putting it to a stake weighted vote, as the vote will always tend to be zero.

What they are proposing is that we consider the longest chain to be the valid chain by definition.

This is not at all what I am saying.

This is not an example of a true Scotsman fallacy, even though it reminded you of that fallacy.
I challenge you to show me how what I am saying is actually a true scotsman fallacy, rather than simply recite the fallacy and tell me you are reminded of it.
It is not a controversial statement that an invalid chain, according to the rules of the protocol, is not Bitcoin, even if it is longer. I am pointing to the important fact that what we are arguing about is what *validity should be* and when that is what you are arguing about, hash power does not settle anything.
Here is more of my opinion on the topic:

@_date: 2017-03-22 12:43:21
Part of what makes the BU fork so damaging to the core chain is that SPV clients will follow BU if it has more hash power.
This proposal enables SPV clients to learn that a block &gt; 1MB and reject it. That puts control back in the hands of the wallet developers and the users, rather than in the hands of the miners.
The clock is ticking for BU. Once this proposal makes its way into wallets it will be far more difficult for BU to succeed.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:59:26

* Bitcoin is the decentralized cryptographic system people use for controlling who can spend what percentage of the total value represented by all bitcoins, where bitcoins are the set of fungible tokens which are the result of incremental modifications to the system started in 2009 by Satoshi.
Based on my definition, the fact that everyone moved on and I am abandoned means that my chain is not the chain that "people use". Nobody other than me uses it. So mine would not be Bitcoin. That is the reason I put that clause in there -- bitcoin is the name of the network that *people actually use* to move the value around.
Furthermore, the other chain, with the majority, is not an alt coin by my definition.


It's not possible? That's a pretty strong claim, and I'd like to know what makes it impossible. Even if it needs to be amended to reflect some details of the work scoring algorithm, I think the idea being expressed by the thought experiment is a valid test of the commenter's definition.

To remove that subjectivity, *you are proposing* using POW, and I am rejecting your proposal. POW can be used to determine the order of transactions. No problem there. POW cannot be used to determine validity, because that would place the definition of validity solely in the hands of the miners. That is unacceptable to me, and to a large chunk of the Bitcoin ecosystem. In effect it makes all other participants SPV nodes.
We the *users* of bitcoin run full nodes and we decide what tokens we will accept in payment, and what tokens we will reject. That is the way it should be. Users, not miners, get to say what is and isn't valid -- just like customers, not merchants, get to say what is and isn't worth buying.
Edit: The original whitepaper recognized that full nodes confer that ability to detect and reject attacks from powerful miners. This would make no sense if the definition of a valid chain is the one with the most work.

I would say it only partly depends on your perspective. Whether or not the attack damages bitcoin is partly an objective question, dealing with predictions about what will happen.

Users should have the option of running full nodes, and governments should not find it trivial to detect whether or not someone is running a full node. Right now, in the United States, I think that means a max block size somewhere around 10 MB.


Not so. Users have a reason to run a full node -- it is the best way to confirm that the money you are receiving is actually in the blockchain.


Sorry, I don't find dogmatism persuasive, and we know more now than Satoshi did in 2008.


They gave it a pretty good shot! If we had done what they suggested and activated segwit in December, fees would not have gotten so high in the short term. Furthermore, many of the prominent core devs indicated they thought it would be realistic to achieve 8 MB blocks in the near future, once various prerequisites (e.g. no quadratic hashing) were deployed. Also, I suspect that at least some of the high fee periods we have experienced were due to transactions created for the purpose of driving up the fees, to encourage the community to call for larger blocks.
So no, I do not think that the blame for high fees can be laid at the feet of the core devs, and neither do I think that they are ignorant of the very basic economic ideas you have described. You have to have observed that guys have an incredibly solid grasp of mathematics -- yet you think that they don't understand what supply and demand is? I mean, maybe the reason they disagree with you is *not* that they are so stupid that they don't understand concepts you learn as a freshman in college.


I want miners to have as little hashrate as possible. I want there to be 1000 independent miners, each with .1% of the hash rate. Yet what do we have? Bitmain and Avalon, but mostly Bitmain is producing almost all of the hardware available for purchase. There are reports that Bitmain is *already* controlling more than 50% of the hash power. This is not unprecedented. Whether it is Ghash.io or F2Pool, or Antpool -- these pools have gotten so large that now you have a situation where Jihan Wu is able to singlehandedly block segwit and boost signaling for BU by how much? This is bad for Bitcoin, but still the miners do it, because it is in their interest to roll the dice with all of our money. They risk killing the golden goose, sure, but if they do not, then some other miner surely will, so they may as well be the ones in control.


Most of the talk about PoW change that erupted recently is directly in response to discussion among BU supporters about plans to try to sabotage the Core chain after the split. Most people seem to agree that a PoW change is undesirable, but would be preferable to being destroyed.


Yes, and that is fine. I suggest you buy some of the other coins. However, I notice that it is Ethereum and Dash and Monero, and not, say Litecoin that are rising. Why do you suppose that is? Litecoin offers much higher capacity than Bitcoin, and would be a suitable coin to use if you cared about fees. Is it a coincidence that the coins that are rising are ones that have other innovations *besides higher capacity?* Specifically, Dash and Monero offer better privacy than Bitcoin. Ethereum and Dash offer different governance models than Bitcoin, and perhaps people are hoping that they will do a better job of avoiding being torn in a civil war like Bitcoin currently is.


If the miners start mining blocks higher than 1 MB, Bitcoin will split. So I guess it is up to them whether to split it or not.

A simple answer is not going to do this question justice, but I'll start by saying that blocks are determined to be valid or invalid by an automated process defined by the c++ code you run. It is either/or. Blocks cannot be more or less invalid than other invalid blocks.
I run bitcoin core, so I would not accept a bitcoin payment that occurred on a chain with a &gt;1 MB block.
As far as my willingness to change to a different c++ codebase? Yes I would be willing to change to a &gt;1MB codebase, but I would be unwilling to change to a bad-sig codebase.

Your questions start treading into philosophical territory that I enjoy visiting:


The more people, the more correct it is to call it Bitcoin. I subscribe to concept of 'truth' that allows for fuzzy logic. For example, suppose I have an apple in my fridge. I take a bite and put the apple back in the fridge. Now do I have an apple in my fridge? How many bites can I take before I don't have an apple in there? I think it's acceptable to say that after you have consumed half of the apple, it is *partially true* to say that you have an apple in the fridge. This is because our minds manipulate compressed conceptual models, not high-fidelity copies of the universe.


Yes. For example, I would have no problem in stating that Ethereum split, and now exists as two blockchains, both of which are Ethereum.
To shamelessly repeat myself from the comment I linked you to earlier:
The problem some people would have with my definition is that if there were a hard fork, then both sides might be "Bitcoin". I don't think this is due to a defect in my definition -- rather I think it reflects an error in our common-sense notion of the nature of "identity." Identity is way of thinking about reality that can fail to be useful in certain edge cases:
In the  we feel conflicted about whether the ship has retained its identity because all of the constituent parts are substituted over time. What is happening is that we are being confronted with the fact our concept of identity, which we enter the world quite confident about, is an over-simplification that can fail us.
In  it is not clear which person walking out of the teleporter is "you" since both of you have claim to the same history. This is almost exactly like the case in a Bitcoin hard fork, after which it can be possible that there are 2 Bitcoins with equal claim to the name.
This problem inherent in the nature of identity itself is a big problem for people who want to say that "because there is an obvious answer to the question of which chain is Bitcoin, hard forks can be expected to sort themselves out" ...
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:06:44
Or in other words:
"Exchanges should think carefully before they try to take power from us miners. It would be very unfortunate if it caused a disasterous hard fork."
This is *the guy* who would decide whether or not to do the hard fork. Over what? Segwit? He must really hate lightning.
We should be sending our transactions *directly* to segwit miners and only to segwit miners. With generous fees. To support them and to starve miners who are not aligned with the economic majority.
Here is my idea for [permanently reducing the power that miners have.]( with a side chain and a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:57:47


That is just not true. For example, sometimes you can withold cooperation until someone makes a concession. That would be an example of pressuring someone to do something without coercing them, and is sufficient to show that your statement is false. Also, merely giving people information changes their behavior sometimes. It's not like you can "unlearn" information once you have learned it just because you wish you had not learned it. Is that coercive? Also, to the extent that people care about what other people want, sometimes simply making your wishes known can modify their behavior or their desires. Also, you can point out to a community someone's bad behavior, causing them to lose status if they choose to continue the behavior. There are a lot of different moral tools, including engaging in an argument in a reddit comment, which is the moral tool you are attempting to use to modify my opinions, and which would be much more likely to work if you were on the right side of the argument.


That is not necessary for me to publicly say that he is being ridiculous and point out to him that he does not have evidence for his claims. But who said that it was only Luke I am attempting to persuade? I am attempting to persuade people who are capable of being persuaded, which may include people who read this thread and find that I am making sense to them. It may be the case that Luke has hardened himself against persuasion. That is an immature thing for him to do, but I cannot know that it is the case without trying. Perhaps he is a better man than the evidence suggests.


I am not certain about anything, and I encourage you to view certainty as an emotional state that promotes intellectual laziness. And no, I am no where near confident that Luke cannot be reached. I used to be a religious person myself, and I was reached.

In this thought experiment, there is nothing invalid about the block mined by the Chinese government. Also, the Chinese government would need to control the majority of the hashpower in order to construct such an alternative history.
This is not a totally far fetched prospect, since the majority of the hashpower is manufactured in China, and as far as I know most of it is operating in China, by permission of the Chinese government.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:18:08
As an example, if a miner produced a block which spent outputs that were spent in an earlier block, then that block would be invalid. Suppose someone mined an alternative block at the same height, but without the double spend. This block would be valid. Now if miners for whatever reason continued to build on both blocks, and if for whatever reason the chain containing the invalid block got longer, it would be incorrect to call that chain Bitcoin, even though it is the longest chain.

What happens with UASF if a non-segwit block is mined on top of a segwit block? Because if the UASF nodes accept that, then it seems like they will be on the majority hashpower chain, at least while &lt;50% of the hash power is anti-segwit.

If you have fraud-poofs for every important policy, then it is much less important for everyone to run a full node -- as Satoshi noted. Perhaps that is the future we can look forward to.
The whitepaper, however, maybe assumes more decentralization in mining than has actually ocurred, due to the emergence of ASICs and pools.
I still don't think we should hand the block size decision to miners, and that the best thing to do right now is activate segwit, deploy schnorr, MAST and lightning, get working on those fraud proofs, and work on incremental hard forks for flex cap and upping the block size to 4 MB blocks, then 8 MB blocks so we can gather experience at each stop along the way.
However, I'm willing to admit that with comprehensive fraud proofs we may be able to get by with drastically fewer full nodes.

@_date: 2017-03-17 13:53:14
You have misunderstood or misremembered. Pretty much every core developer agrees with raising the block size more after segwit. They vary in how much, and how fast. A bunch of them even signed the Hong Kong agreement to that effect. Adam Back's original idea was to carefully do a 2-4-8 blocksize over time, iirc. Peter Wuille had a geometric blocksize growth BIP to account for improved hardware. Core devs want to grow the block size as fast as safety permits. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:09:54
So to be clear about thing, segwit and lightning is fine, and you don't like RBF and full blocks?
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:19:15
Couple other things:
1. After the hard fork, the community will immediately have access to 2 MB (1 MB for core, 1MB for BU) which may crater fees on both sides. As soon as core activates segwit that goes up to 2.7 MB.
2. BU wants to expand the block size so that blocks are not full, further reducing the need to pay fees to get on the BU branch.

I appreciate your gracious, serious and thought out answer. And I agree with you that Satoshi's original concept, expressed in the white paper, was that design disputes would be settled automatically by seeing which chain was the longest.
However, I do not believe that Satoshi anticipated the current context, in which we have a small number of people controlling a majority of the hash power. I do not see how bitcoin is "peer-to-peer" in any sense if the peers are stripped of any meaningful influence over the system, and all power is given to these hash-kings. Satoshi spoke of 1 CPU, 1 Vote, and the assumption in his design was that mining would remain a very distributed activity and that miner preference would be a good proxy for the opinions, wisdom and desires of the users.
So although I think Satoshi was a genius and I think the design of Bitcoin is beautiful, I think these are weaknesses in his original concept. I am not familiar with all of Satoshi's writing, so I cannot speak for how his opinion may have evolved over time.
But what should I do about these facts? Should I say "oh well, Satoshi made mistakes, but these properties are either unchangeable or at a minimum it would be wrong to attempt to change them?" That appears to be the position of some -- if you don't like it, get out. Go find a coin you do like. Leave Bitcoin alone.
That is one option, and it is understandable if people want to tell me to go away and leave them alone with their Bitcoin. In fact, there are other coins which I think achieve a better design than Bitcoin, and I buy those. However, I also hold a lot of Bitcoin, and I do not see anything wrong with advocating that Bitcoin improve over time, even if that means abandoning aspects of the design which seemed reasonable 9 years ago, or taking on new design features which serve to spread out the power and influence over the system.
You mentioned Proof of Stake -- I think that is an excellent idea and I wish it would be incorporated into Bitcoin. It would be very good to know what the major holders of Bitcoin think about various proposals.
Furthermore, like it or not, Bitcoin is embedded in a larger game -- a game of politics and economics, which includes such things as reddit, and twitter, and the legal system. These things all put their pressure on the decision that the economic participants make. When Satoshi said that the longest chain resolves the dispute, he clearly did not envision a contentious hard fork which results in two competing versions of Bitcoin which we are apparently on course to experience. I think it is important for individuals to run full nodes so that they can stay on whichever side of the fork they prefer.
The ability of users to have full nodes to fully validate the chain is also part of the design, so in particular I cannot support BU which would allow miners to raise the block size so high that this becomes too expensive for most users.

5. Who can't run a validating node

To the contrary, this is a great plan.


Ver is a dishonest person who has failed at convincing people so is now attempting to buy their cooperation. That is your definition of generosity?
I mine at a loss to support the network I believe in. After the split, I will be on the Core side no matter what.
Also, if my plan succeeds, any BU coins I mined would be destroyed, resulting in a total loss unless I had the good sense to dump them on the market immediately.


Miners should at least switch to BU for the bribe so long as the BU hash power is safely &lt;50%. At that point they need to decide whether to help drag things out to tease more money out of Ver, or help push BU off the cliff without real wings.

Yes, that's fine. When I said that users must go down a separate fork, I mean separate from the miners, not separate from the blockchain they were on prior to the fork event.


This is correct, but note that nothing about the scenario demands that the majority of users are not willing to go along with the miners. We could be talking about a scenario where the economic majority agrees we should raise the inflation rate, and I am both on the wrong side of the miners and of the user consensus. Should I go along? Depends on your definition of "should" but I don't think there is any obligation to go along.
Coin voting is attractive, but it has some problems.
One problem is deciding how to score the vote. How much do you weigh 'time held'? How much do you weigh 'amount held'? How much do you weigh 'transactions performed?' How much do you weigh 'transaction fees paid'? How much do you weigh 'transaction amount?' Different scoring vectors would give more or less vote influence to different groups of people. If you give people vote power for performing transactions, do they spam the blockchain grinding for votes?
Another problem is that it amplifies the voice that custodians (e.g. exchanges) have -- because they could decide to use the coins (or transactions) under their control to vote for something which the legal owners do not want to vote for.
Another issue is that coin-voting has an important limitation.
To understand what I mean, let's say you hold a coin vote and determine that the users want Feature Z. Let's say you want to be sure the miners are on board, so you set an activation threshold of 95%. Time passes and the miners do not signal for Feature Z.
Now what? What did coin voting actually achieve here? It tells you what the coin-voters want to happen, but to execute the decision requires another step.
One step you could take is to program the nodes such that a supermajority vote for Feature Z will generate a flag day, after which full nodes will fork to accept Feature Z. This is a risky move, because it automatically creates a possible hard fork on the flag day. Now you are playing chicken with the miners. If the miners refuse to build on Feature Z fork, then the nodes will end up on a branch with minority hash power. This is not a nice branch to end up on because miners can attack it with a portion of their hash power and halt it.
Perhaps this is not something to worry about because the miners always give in and implement Feature Z before the hard fork happens. After all, the voters have spoken, and the miners understand that they may end up mining economically worthless coins. However, this is inherently more risky than a simple miner-led soft fork.

As far as I can tell, the downside to head first mining is that SPV clients take a bigger risk when they participate in a non-reversible interaction after 2 or 3 confirmations, right? Obviously they can't trust 0 conf, or 1 conf, and by the time you get to 4 conf enough time has elapsed that simultaneous validation would have notified the miners to abandon the chain.
The downside to not hashing immediately is that you give the miner that found the previous block additional head start equal to the validation time plus any delta between header and full block transmission time.
I suppose reasonable people can disagree about which of these is worse, but the answer seems pretty clear to me. If you are in a business that wants to accept 2-3 conf transactions you should be validating.

Or a hard fork. That's a veto over any changes in the Bitcoin consensus protocol, unless users are so exasperated that they reach for the difficult, risky and costly 'nuclear option' of changing the POW. Which they are unlikely to do. Veto power not only means that you get to say "NO!" it also means that devs take your veto into consideration when crafting their proposal, and may feel the need to leave out the parts you object to or sweeten the deal with other things you want. So it indirectly means you get to influence what proposals are even included in releases of Bitcoin Core.

"Ownership" of bitcoin is something quite different. It is enforced by physics instead of by violence. So yes, in the case of bitcoin, property is possible without violence. But I wouldn't call it property, I would call it control.

Some ideas tho to make mining more decentralized:
1. Proof of ability to use waste heat profitably
2. Proof of money not being used right now (e.g. proof of stake, proof of time-locked coins) 
3. Proof of underutilized hardware (e.g. proof of storage, proof of bandwidth)
4. Proof of transaction fees sacrificed
5. Reputation-based systems
6. Increase number of discrete events to mine (GHOST, high block frequency, sharding, treechains, less winner-take-all)

One of the reasons Bitcoin is fascinating to me is that it finds news ways to coordinate human behavior that do not involve punishment. It is more like a lock on your car door rather than the threat of putting someone in jail for stealing. This is a superior way in my opinion. It is more effective because bad behavior (and the suffering it causes) is made less possible, and also because punishment also harms people and imposes various costs on society. Also, because punishment tends not to be handed out in an impartial fashion, and powerful people can make themselves above the law etc.

If someone sent me coins in a block that was 1.1 MB, I would not accept those, because I would be concerned that other people would not accept them from me. Those coins would not be fungible with coins from blocks under 1.1 MB.

That's interesting to learn, however I don't think that it really interferes with the thought I am trying to experiment with. Let's change the thought experiment to incorporate this, and suppose that China suddenly springs an alternative blockchain with 457000 blocks and more work than the current blockchain. There are no transactions other than the coinbase transactions.
This blockchain is valid. It isn't a hard fork. It isn't a soft fork. Is it the real Bitcoin, and we have been using an alt-coin all this time?
It isn't according to my definition of what "Bitcoin" is:
* Bitcoin is the decentralized cryptographic system people use for controlling who can spend what percentage of the total value represented by all bitcoins, where bitcoins are the set of fungible tokens which are the result of incremental modifications to the system started in 2009 by Satoshi.

The difference is *consensus*. If Bitcoin blocks were coming slowly enough, there would be broad consensus to hard fork to a lower difficulty. If the blocks were not coming slowly enough, consensus would not exist.
If you try to hard fork in the absence of consensus, you just end up with two chains, like happened with Ethereum and like what apparently is going to happen to Bitcoin when BU forks. That outcome has a very high cost, and should generally be avoided.

Maybe it would be good, but here are a couple of things to consider:
1. If miners were required to report KYC, then they would need to know the identity of every person who is transacting. This would be a very effective way to not only spy on everyone, but also be able to instantly seize their money. No problem so long as government officials are angels that always do what is good for everyone, but if government officials are corrupt or do not put your interests first it could be a problem.
2. Governments may not appreciate having a deflationary currency such as Bitcoin. Miners could be compelled to change the inflation schedule to conform with whatever the government decides is healthy for everyone.

I think the intention was, or at least should have been, that the decisions miners made are worthwhile insofar miners are a good proxy for the desires of the users. The idea that what miners want and need is somehow the point of bitcoin, or the most important consideration is the part that I say is absurd. A world without bitcoin mining, all other things held constant, would be a *better world* because mining consumes a lot of energy, and is not an intrisically worthwhile activity.
The white paper does not make a careful distinction between the desires of the users and the desires of the miners. You could say, as I take your meaning, that this is because the desires of the users are irrelevant. Bitcoin exists to serve the miners. I think it is more likely that Satoshi was aiming for a system where if the miners pursued their own interests, then the desires of the users would be fulfilled by the clever game.
What we have now is a situation where reality is calling that assumption into question. Mining power is not widely dispersed, as appears to have been Satoshi's intention. Rather most of the mining power is consolidated into the hands of a couple of people. This is good for those miners, but bad for the users because it creates an unstable situation, where the miners are too powerful and are control points for governments to apply pressure. These people have decided to block segwit deployment, because although it is good for users, they predict it will be bad for miners because it will enable second-layer protocols to divert fees to intermediaries. They have also decided to put their support behind BU, which takes control of the block size limit away from the users and places it in the hands of the miners. This is good from the miners' perspective but bad from the users' perspective.
So you have three examples where the interests of the miners and the interest of the users diverge. Now I ask you -- whose interests *ought* to matter in this conflict? I say it is the users, and we should look for ways to help the users gain more power in this situation.

I'm not sure it would kill the network effect -- if I introduced a clone of Bitcoin that only inflated to 10 million coins instead of 21 million, would that kill the network effect?

Good point. Also, it is my understanding that if the Core chain overtakes the BU chain, the BU nodes will reorganize back to Core, halting the BU chain.

I think it's not analogous to a bitcoin exchange being hacked. The whole architecture of Ethereum is to be an unrestricted base-layer platform on which to build smart contracts. If people cannot build smart contracts that they know are safe, then what is Ethereum for? So is less stupid (though an oversimplification) to say that Ethereum has been hacked. I'm not saying this is the end of Ethereum or anything. After all, Bitcoin was hacked once upon a time. :-) But people have long worried that a scripting language that is too powerful makes it impossible to trust the resulting code -- and this hack is a good example of how a subtle exploit could be catastrophic.

That's good, but there are a couple of reasons this could be better:
* Every node is an "exit node"

* Might be more convenient to run a program like this than configure tor usage?
* I want to introduce a new piece of software anyway so as to enable remote control of the destination of the transaction so that transactions can go privately to miners signaling advocating a particular soft fork
* ATR nodes could talk to each other via tor for yet another layer of security

Right on. In terms of fraud reduction, Bitcoin's irreversibly can mean that some transactions can take place much faster. e.g. you can settle financial trades in hours instead of days, you can fund your gambling or trading account much faster than ACH would permit. Cross jurisdiction contracts can be tricky, because if anything goes wrong I have heard it is not worthwhile to seek compensation through the legal system. Bitcoin could help in places where the legal system is too expensive or inconvenient.
Also, the fact that you can spend a miner fee and irrevocably publish timestamped information to the blockchain gives bitcoin value -- though it doesn't seem like this use-case is taking off.
I expect most of the sustainable value, though, to come from being a way to protect wealth from being eroded or seized by governments or banks. Which is what Satoshi had in mind, based on my read of the message in the genesis block.

It's like shredded wheats after a halving...
But to address your point that I am asking someone to throw out logic, reasoning and current facts, let me try to support my initial sentence:


Transaction fees are currently less than 10% of the block reward. In the scenario where we are discussing a boost in the subsidy of 1000% I think it's an acceptable back of the napkin estimate simplification to ignore transaction fees when deciding whether or not the subsidy increase is insignificant. I don't agree that it amounts to throwing out logic, reasoning and current facts.


This is contemplating an aggressive hard fork by more than 50% of the miners and a suitable economic majority, in response to a looming crisis in 12 years where the block reward gets too low to secure Bitcoin against block reordering attacks. I'm arguing that we should not be dogmatic and stay on an insecure chain just because we "hate Keynesians" or something. In such a scenario, it would not require throwing out logic, reasoning and current facts to imagine that the modified chain would conceivably have as much market cap as the legacy chain.
I'm not suggesting a hard fork today to permanent inflation. I'm saying that Bitcoin should have been designed that way from the beginning, and perhaps within the next 10-20 years it will become clear that we cannot afford to continue halving the inflation rate.

Yes, I was incorrect. You could do a blocksize increase even if you weighted segwit data and non-segwit data equally.


I think a nuanced understanding is important here. Yes, all bitcoin design choices have a political aspect from them. That is not in the same category as saying "people don't like segwit because some developers signed the HK agreement." I could say that I refuse to adopt segwit because Luke-jr. would get some of the credit, and he is a Catholic, and I dislike Catholics. That is the kind of politics that I think should not get involved. Similarly, what is happening with the HK agreement is that an upgrade is being held hostage as a political football, independently of technical merits, or game theory/political ramifications.

I like satoshis too, partly because the term shortens to 'sat' or 'sats' which is one syllable and not an overloaded term. E.g. lunch is 152 kilosats seems cool, atom-punk, and clean -- like it has cleared it's phonological orbit.
By contrast 'kilobits' has baggage because it is an overloaded term and it has connotations from the over use of 'bit' in branding in the IT sector. Just in crypto currency there is over use of the term 'bit' for things that are not related to the conception of a measure of value. To me it feels dorky, dated and muddled with too many connotations and denotations.
Yes, I am aware that bit would be recognizable to people 150 years ago as money, or possibly 'a little of something' but I don't really see the payoff of borrowing that extinct tradition.
Also, the 1/100 relationship between bits and sats offers no actual advantage beyond superficial familiarity. It is just one more oddball conversion to have to learn and do arithmetic on.

To be fair to me, you could notice that I was responding to dellintelbitcoin's point. Not to yours. Maybe you would state your argument a little more clearly and give me a chance to respond to it?
As a historical data point, Ethereum hard forked and the modified chain walked away with 90% of the market cap. And that was not with the strategy of halting the unmodified chain with a merge mine attack. (Yes, the miners on the losing chain would have the option to throw their hardware in the trash and start over with a new POW, but why wouldn't they just say to hell with it and join the new chain they already have hardware for, and which has a higher block reward, and which is a more secure and fair coin anyway?) So I'm not sure why it's unreasonable nonsense to assume at least a 50% split in a Bitcoin hard fork.

I'm not sure how it would all shake out.  Perhaps a USA miner would only be asked to do KYC on blocks they mine. Or it may become impossible to legally mine in the USA.


I think a hard fork that results in miners having control over the block size is a big step toward a future where there are only a handful of important miners, very large blocks, and those miners are almost the only ones validating the blockchain. In that world, miners look much more like money transmitters than they do in the current world, and it would be much more practical and tempting to regulate them as such.

That's interesting -- I ran a rpi for a while and the number of peers hovered in the 9 to 11 range. I always assumed it was because my pi was some kind of poor performer.
My pi took more than 3 weeks to do the initial sync. Shutting down bitcoin before rebooting the pi after installing updates always seemed agonizingly slow. Part of why I got the NUC is I figured there will be a blocksize increase one way or another in the next year, and that would likely be the end of using the pi.
But I'm glad you're having a good experience with it!

This would require hard forking Core into 2 chains -- one with replay protection and one without replay protection. There is no way such a hard fork would gain conensus to do safely in less than 3 months. Core doesn't have a magic wand to make everyone agree to a hasty hard fork!


That doesn't follow. Everyone who hold coins before the fork ought to desire replay protection. S2X is the one deploying forking code. They have the ability and responsability to implement replay protection. If Core ever decides to deploy a hard fork, then it had better have replay protection, and I fully expect that it would, because Core is under the control of careful, conservative programmers who don't take foolish risks with other people's money.

I don't have a knock down argument against that, and of course adversarial design means that any plan should be thought all the way through and air tight. It makes an interesting thought experiment.
Here are a couple of things to consider:
The idea that B-Block miners will not be in a competitive situation and will have extra money to launch expensive and unprofitable attacks on the network strikes me as implausible. We have seen that mining is an insanely competitive industry. The dynamics of difficulty adjustment will, I would assert, assure that there will be only small profits for the top tier B-Block miners, and losses for the bottom performers.
The idea that solo miners will, therefore, have on hand some huge pile of ASICs, with leased rack space, just to occasionally and unprofitably divert their electrical power and attack the A-Miners seems implausible.
When would they launch this attack? When they magically sense that A-Miners are working on a disfavored block? Trying to orphan an already mined disfavored block?
Bear in mind that if the solo miners divert their electricity to their latent A-Mining capacity, they must either switch off their B-Mining equipment, or have huge latent electrical power capacity. The scale of large solo mining operations may make having all of that optional electrical power expensive as well. This is not like plugging in your vacuum cleaner; these large mining operations might need to contract with power plants ahead of time or they can create local brown outs or have their service deactivated. For miners parked near remote hydroelectric or solar installations, extra capacity may simply not physically exist.
Furthermore, the scenario where solo miners have all of those A-block ASICs, and spare capacity, and can have them on all the time, etc, ... well that is simply not the scenario I am pondering. In that scenario, the solo miners have 100% of the hashpower pointed at B-blocks, and 50%+ of the hash power pointed at A-blocks. With 75% of the total network hashpower, of course it is game over in this game design, as it would be in the current Bitcoin design.
If, rather than have spare capacity, the attacking B-miners divert power from solving the B-block, they give B-miners who are not participating in the censorship initiative a grace period to mine with less competition, and possibly include undesired transactions that way, creating a kind of whack-a-mole situation. 
Last thing, it may not be very efficient to try to instantly power up ASICs and start hashing, compared with ASICs which hash continuously without being powered down.

It isn't appropriate to call raising the block size in this way an 'upgrade'. It's a security downgrade, not a scalability upgrade.

No, if it is a spinoff, you would pay capital gains tax when you sell either asset.

If that was more than a year ago, LT rates would apply.  (IANAL. This sounds like the reasonable treatment to me, but sometimes regulators don't act reasonably.)

Both are good points, but I'd put transaction fees in a different category from the subsidy. Subsidy is more like "OMG this thing no one actually uses is burning up the world's energy." With transaction fees we can tell that people are repeatedly making the decision to pay them, presumably because they are the cheapest option for securely transmitting value. If that is the case, then any other option would be more wasteful than chosing Bitcoin.

Good criticisms but I'll be devil's advocate:


Version bits are not so much a statement about which rules will be enforced in the future. Version bits have two other more important roles. First, they indicate the rules that are being enforced by the block whose version it is. That is to say, a block in the past, not the future. It would be highly dangerous for a block to signal one version, but not actually play by the rules of that version, I agree with that.
Second, they indicate what rules the miner prefers. Let's say we get to 95% and segwit activates, I suspect that the remaining 5% of hash power will NOT continue mining non-segwit blocks only to have them rejected. In other words, these last holdouts were not using the version to signal the blocks they intend to mine in the future, rather they were signaling whether or not they think segwit should activate. That sounds like voting to me.


Yes, but consider the scenario where a soft fork is on the brink of activating. &gt;90% of the hash power is signaling for a soft fork.
* If there is only a small amount of voting going on, then it is not a major economic incentive
* If there is a large amount of voting going on, then it probably indicates widespread agreement that the soft fork is a good idea for Bitcoin
* Miners do have an incentive not to set version bits fraudulently out of laziness. An accidental hard fork is bad for business. Also, they need to be prepared in the case of activation not to start mining blocks that will not be accepted.
* Is the argument here that once activation occurs, the miners will suddenly reveal that they lied about being willing to activate? So they could get more fees? What happens to them now that it is time to go through with their nefarious plan.... they start mining blocks that won't be accepted? Or they hard fork the network? Doesn't seem like a strategy a rational responder to economic incentives would follow. If they have some other objective to execute a hard fork than as the undesirable side effect of scooping up more fees, then we are already vulnerable to that attack anyway.
* Signaling a particular soft fork isn't just a message about what rules your block followed about about what you will likely do in the future. Signaling a particular soft fork *can help cause the fork to happen* which is the voting aspect to it. If miner who does not want a soft fork to activate votes for it, they help it activate. Once it activates, they are not necessarily in control of what happens next. The upgraded nodes all flip over, other miners start enforcing rules, etc. If they signal for a soft fork they don't want, they take the risk that they will GET the soft fork they don't want. They also open themselves up to playing chicken with miners who are not signaling but who do want the soft fork and will suddenly start signaling at 90% etc.
As you pointed out, I would not find it difficult to pay miners to signal a certain version. I don't need this mechanism to do so. In other words, the economic incentive you are worried about can exist today. Who is to say that some philanthropist is not offering cash money to pools to upgrade to signal segwit. So new risks are not being brought into being.
I've often thought about paying particular miners, but I don't like the fact that it forms a white list. Small pools / solo miners are unlikely to get paid this way, and it seems like a bad idea to punish them for trying to improve decentralization.

If you ignore transaction fees, in 2025, a coin with 1% inflation and a similar market cap can afford to buy 100% of the hashpower as Bitcoin. In 2029 it can afford to buy 300% of the hashpower. In 2033 it can afford to buy 500% of the hashpower. In 2037 it can afford to buy 1000% of the hashpower. These are probably not negligible numbers, even after you add back the transaction fees.
In the hostile takeover I alluded to, miners create the coin with inflation and merge mine it with Bitcoin. They simultaneously launch the inflation-coin and start mining bitcoin blocks with zero transactions on the legacy chain.

The legacy chain could attempt to add replay protection, but replay protection necessarily requires a hard fork, and it is not reasonable to demand an existing chain initiate a hard fork simply to add replay protection against an undesired backward incompatible upgrade attempt. It is impractical to deploy such a hard fork on a running chain, likely to actually further fragment the legacy chain, and doesn't actually prevent the newcomer from making the necessary changes to *do replay attacks anyway!* 
The new chain by contrast is causing the crisis, already is opt in and already is a hard fork. There is zero legitimate argument to have that they do not bear the responsibility to add RP protection.

@_date: 2017-01-01 02:54:56
Consider a scenario:
* 60% of the hash power is owned by a handful of solo miners
* 40% of the hash power is controlled by a few pools
This is a bad situation for Bitcoin, because it means that if you want to censor transactions, all you need to do is control a handful of solo miners. You do not even necessarily contact the pool operators at all.
If you switch to the scheme I have outlined, the hash-power should get allocated as follows:
* 50% of the hash power will be allocated to A-Blocks, and 50% to B-Blocks. This is because the reward on each phase is equal, so if it is noticed that the difficulty on one phase is lower than another, more hash power will be moved there.
* 100% of the B-Block hash power will be large solo-miners. Only large miners can tolerate the variance, and the work cannot be outsourced to un-trustable (that is to say, un-punishable) entities.
* 80% of the A-Block hash power will be pools, 20% will be large solo miners.
I would argue that this is a superior situation. By rounding up all of the small miners and focusing their power on only half of the blocks, you put them in greater control of those blocks. Forcing these little guys to censor transactions is much more difficult, so it is likely that otherwise censored transactions will be mined by them. In fact, the continued existence and relevance of these little fish is a deterrent to attempting censorship in the first place.

I think you're confusing the past with the future there. Pools representing 93% of hash rate may have committed to running S2X. I don't know what the actual number is or the pools involved. But pools can change their minds -- especially since the whole Bitcoin Cash thing has happened. Pools may also change their minds if exchanges refuse to list S2X because it doesn't include replay protection. Perhaps more importantly, the individuals who work for the pools cannot be bound by the promises the pool operator makes.
You can expect the hashrate ratio to tend to mirror the ratio of value between mining blocks on each chain. That will depend on the difficulty and the exchange rate.
As for the 2016 block difficulty adjustment, I'm not worried. I expect at least 10% of the hashrate to follow Core. If half are segwit transactions, that would provide roughly 20 megabytes per day of transactions (14% of today's capacity), and that will be enough to sustain Core until the difficulty drops. Most of the value of Bitcoin is in holding and trading on exchange. Those use cases require very few transactions. Also, the lightning network is nearly ready to deploy and could come into use before November to provide a way to batch transactions and offer high fees to miners on a per block measurement.
So I don't see why I would be worried.

They certainly should have. Right?
I think their plan for replay protection was that the majority of the economy would get on board, and that would force the majority of the miners onboard, which would reorg the other chain out of existence after a short period unless the other side hard forked. If they failed to achieve majority hashrate, they should have been prepared to switch to a hard fork with replay protection.
Edit to say that the other alternative to a hard fork if they could not muster the economic majority (which presumably would pull in the mining majoiryt) would be to abandon the UASF, which was shaolinfry's recommendation as I recall.

My apologies if I have excluded other common arguments. It was not my intention.


I was not aware of it's status as the primary complaint, but I have not browsed in a while..


I'm not sure what the criteria was for picking the witness space discount, but have not seen any rigorous analysis of it's effects on the fee market.
I have not seen an argument put forward yet that convinces me that there would be any problematic economic consequences for the mining fee market. Of course it is always wise to study things like that out properly before charging forward with a change.
Are critics of segwit also worried about the economic effects of the blocksize increase segwit will create? Maybe you can point me to the academic publication by an economist analyzing the impact of this increase on the fee market? If not, perhaps this should be listed among the primary complaints against segwit and other blocksize increase proposals.


I was just laying out what is fresh in my memory. No sinister intentions, and I want to be fair minded. I would appreciate a little charity in discussion and am willing to give some. I have read a fair bit of over the last year, but less lately. Feel free to add whatever you think I have missed.


If SegWit proposed with 0% discount, then it would not be a blocksize increase. This is kind of Charlie's point as well. With a 75% discount it gets you to something similar to 2MB -- an increase that pretty much everyone seems to think the network can handle.


Modifications such as segwit should be evaluated and adopted (or not adopted) based on technical merits, not based on political calculations. It may be impossible, unfortunately, to keep politics out of Bitcoin, but how does the HK agreement have anything to do with whether segwit is good or bad? Sounds more like a compliant against the people who signed the agreement than a complaint against segwit.

Back of the napkin calculation:

Never fear! These scientists have the solution! Just lower the difficulty! That will allow miners who are currently unprofitable to join in and burn more ... electricity...

No, hard forks should include replay protection. What you are suggesting is a bit like saying "People who ride in my car should take responsibility for their own safety by bringing a seat belt, because my car doesn't have any." No, the car should have seat belts. It is reasonable to consider seat belts to be the responsibility of the person with the car. And to make the analogy closer, you have a situation where passengers are forced into the car whether they like it or not!
Ethical drivers and drivers who care about their passengers will supply seat belts. Ethical developers and developers who care about their users will supply replay protection when they deploy a hard fork.
Splitting your coins when there is no replay protection takes time, knowledge, effort and money. It is not something that every user is capable of. If someone loses their coins due to a replay attack, yes, I will tell them they should have taken responsibility to educate themselves and split their coins properly. However, I will also tell devs that they should include replay protection. It is possible for both sides to deserve blame.

Yes. And insofar as your proposal preserves the ability of legacy nodes to validate all transactions, I applaud your proposal. However, forward blocks do *not* achieve this by increasing throughput. What they would achieve by increasing throughput is to weaken the ability for full nodes to validate every transaction.
If we take my line of reasoning, then every block size increase is a security downgrade, and fails to achieve something worth calling a scaling upgrade. Which is roughly correct.
And yes, I absolutely include segwit. That segwit increased the block size was a *downgrade* not an *upgrade.* It was a compromise that unfortunately necessary to activate segwit and get the *upgrade* parts of segwit, e.g. fixing malleability, weighting signatures less than transaction info and script versioning.

"Transactions are keyed to phases" means that when I create a transaction, I must select which phase may validly mine the transaction.
Let's say you are an A-miner, and an A-block is mined. Now what do you do? Do you power down your hardware until a valid B-block is mined? Once a valid B-block is mined, you must validate it before you can start mining, which puts you at a disadvantage, especially if the block interval is only 5 minutes.
It would be great if you could just start mining the next A-block immediately. You could mine an empty A-block immediately, because you have the previous A-block header, and the B-block header immediately before it... However, you do not know which transactions are about to be included in the B-block currently under construction. If you duplicate their work, you will not be paid for it.
This last problem goes away if roughly half of the mem-pool cannot be mined by B-miner. You stay away from those transactions and you are probably pretty safe.
As for big miners rendering their previous investment void -- I don't think that is any problem. Mining equipment is obsolete very quickly. Just give everyone enough runway and a gradual cut-over and it will be fine.
The much bigger (insurmountable?) problem would be getting consensus on a hard fork, but I have a suspicion that a change like this could be done with a clever soft fork, since apparently almost anything can.

I should have addressed the topic explicitly, but I admit I was not paying close enough attention to it.
The UASF position was as follows, from [


Some prominent developers (e.g. and perhaps realized what kind of fire we were playing with better than I did.
It is impossible for a soft fork to implement replay protection, so it is impossible for a User Activate Soft Fork to implement replay protection.
Soft forks with a majority of hashpower do not need replay protection, because the legacy chain can be expected to die off and be reorg'd back to the fork chain.
So the question is whether or not it is ethical to do a soft fork when the majority of hash power has not agreed to it.
The justification UASF sought for itself was that if the vast economic majority can commit to a soft fork, then majority mining power can be expected to acquiesce and thereby provide replay protection. Furthermore, you could argue, although I think it is a weak argument, that the miners who choose to buck the will of the economic majority should bear the blame for the chain split. I think that's weak, because the counter argument could be that the forkers could have chosen a hard fork design.
If widespread user consensus could not be obtained to deploy UASF, then (as it says on the website) it should be abandoned and a hard fork option, with replay protection, should have been pursued.
But frankly, I did not think it through as carefully as I should have. So I accept your criticism and will try to do better.
The situation is easier to judge when you are talking about a hard fork instead of a soft fork. Hard forks can and should always implement replay protection.
If you disagree, and you think that UASF without majority hashrate, or economic majority is ethically responsible, or if you think that hard forks need not implement replay protection, feel free to make your argument.

Using a scarce resource more efficiently is preferable to using more of it. Especially if it is not known how small the block size needs to be to protect the network from attack.

This is your signal to turn on the humility. When you see someone that you have good reason to believe has extensive technical knowledge saying something that sounds technically incorrect -- that is the right time to carefully consider the possibility that you may be the one who is wrong.
As far as segwit goes, yes, it could be done without any capacity increase. You could simply say that by the rules of the soft fork the regular block, plus the segwit data, must add up to less than or equal to 1 megabyte.

That is technically true, but not very important if people are doing segwit transactions. The component of the transaction that is counted by legacy nodes would be smaller, because it would not include the witness.
So legacy nodes would see the same number of transactions per second, but they would all be very small transactions, such that the total block was (to use your number) 600k instead of 1000k. Meanwhile, upgraded nodes would see and count all of the "missing" data, ensuring that the two add up to the same thing that they *would* have added up to if they had all been placed together in the old format.
This account oversimplifies a few things:
1. Not everyone will switch to segwit transactions immediately
2. The 4 bytes counted as 1 byte discount on witness data is a positive change that somehow encourages mempool consolidation, and would not be had under this scheme.
3. I think the actual TPS would be slightly smaller than it is currently, because a little bit more information is required to do a segwit block than an ordinary block. Very small effect though.


Not so -- old nodes would not reject the 600k blocks filled with "anyone can spend" transactions. This would be a soft fork.
I think this is a point that a lot of people have lost sight of, so I am happy to harp on it. Segwit does not require a blocksize increase, but is does offer a way to accomplish a blocksize increase of similar size to Bitcoin Classic without the risk Bitcoin Classic carries of splitting Bitcoin into two competing currencies, as happened with ETH/ETC.
Opponents of segwit are worried about three things that I can see:
1. They view the change as a kludge incurring technical debt. In a non-consensus system I might agree with them that it is not the most clean way to make the change, but consensus is paramount, so sometimes it's safer to bend over backwards a little bit for it. There are a lot of things in bitcoin that it is better to leave alone rather than tidy up because it would jeopardize consensus. Anyway, the messiness is quite minimal and basically entails looking for the segwit merkle root in a surprising place. It's more like annoying to OCD types than it is real complication from a computer science perspective.
2. They view soft forks as inferior politically to hard forks.
3. They want much larger block sizes than 2MB, and view the segwit boost as resolving the immediate capacity panic in a way that does not leave the door open to far larger blocks in the future.

Hi slush, how about some kind of scheme like this. We have 2 or more different algos -- say SHA2 and SHA3 for example. And you key your transaction to be minable by a particular algorithm. In this way, the users of bitcoin could decide which algorithm to fund.
Where it gets interesting is that solo miners must decide which chips to purchase. They could select a 50% mix for example, but that would leave them vulnerable if a large fraction of users decided that the miner was too large. The users themselves could boycot one of the algorithms -- not sending it any transactions, and rewarding miners who have more of the other rig.
Edit: less extremely, users could adjust the profitability of one of the algorithms by sending out two copies of their transactions with two different fees, or by adjusting the rate at which they use each algorithm, etc.

Yes, certainly. Probability makes the best sense conceptualized as a truth about the state the *oberver* is in, based on observations made so far.
The SEC will either approve COIN or the SEC will not. Only one outcome will be observed in due time. We do not anticipate that the SEC will 25% approve COIN and 75% disapprove it, or that there will be a superposition of partial realities or anything spooky. As you say, there may **already** be an observer within the SEC in a position to say that COIN absolutely will not be approved. In which case, they can make a prediction with close to 100% probability and we cannot. The fact that there can legitimately be multiple separate probabilities (as many as there are observers, really) shows pretty clearly that probability (the way we ordinarily use the term) is not an attribute of the observed thing, but of the observer. (Or even more precisely, it is an attribute of the set of observations which the observer has made.)

Just to make sure we are talking about the same scenario:
1. 75% of the hashpower evaporates
2. After a preset number of blocks, the timestamp starts being compared block height and a decision is made whether or not to change POW.
3. The chain decides to change the POW because the timestamp is advancing too slowly.
4. From the 75% of miners who were not mining on the Core chain, they reveal that they were secretly witholding an alternate chain, that has more work than the public chain. They try to reorganize the Core chain to this other chain.
Under **that** circumstance I argue high consensus would switfly come to switch POW and avoid further shenanigans. The miners would have shamelessly and explicitly attacked the core chain and there would be almost no argument to make in favor of remaining vulnerable to them. Complete consensus? No I guess not. But a comfortably high percentage of the users.

This might be true if you have the *market* supermajority, that is to say people are unwilling to pay much of anything for the new coins. BTC1 does not claim to have that. It claims to have the hashrate super majority, which is very fickle.


Go back and look at the Ethereum split. There was like 1% or less hashpower on the legacy chain at first. Then it got listed on Poloniex and got a market price, and the hashpower rebalanced according to the market price of the tokens.
Do not underestimate your enemy and *DO NOT* underestimate the team of developers that made Bitcoin what it is today, most of whom have expressed their disapproval of btc1. The legacy chain is going to continue. November is 3 months away, and just as one scenario to consider, the legacy chain could probably use lightning nodes to continue operating even if there are only 10 blocks being mined every day. And holding coins, which is what most users of BTC are doing, does not require any transactions at all.

Yes, I admit there are serious -- probably insurmountable downsides to changing this attribute of Bitcoin so long after it was launched.

I wish it had been designed and marketed with a small permanent inflation target, but we are where we are.
My goal in these conversations is to chip away at the absolutist attitude that says inflation is a non-starter. Inflation has problems, but I think it is could be an ethical and viable way to pay for Bitcoin's security if transaction fees cannot do it.

Often, especially when you get to abstract concepts, words do not have a single "correct definition" derived from some platonic reality, which I am therefore guilty of the sin of deviating from. It's not like I'm holding up a pickle and calling it a bicycle. Words are more similar to the names of variables in a computer program.
In fact, words are more like the names of software applications that run in your mind and operate in various ways on the other software already in memory. The fact that the piece of software you instantiate when the word "heretic" comes up is different from the software I instantiate when the word "heretic" comes up does not make me guilty of inappropriately redefining anything.
All of us customize our concepts to try to "divide things by classes, where the natural joints are" to borrow Plato again. It is only objectionable to the dogmatic mind, which would rather put a halt to this process of understanding things better and better, under the misapprehension that people or gods from the past got it right the first time and we can do no better than to copy them.
I do not object to your own tailoring of the meanings of words. You understand things and define things in whatever way makes the most sense to you. I request reciprocal charity in that department. But I am not going to get into a battle of semantics with someone who has unusual interpretations of words *and who will use deviations from those definitions to show that his opponent is wrong.*

Bitmain has emerged as a major threat to the decentralization of Bitcoin. They control too much of the production of mining hardware. They control too much of the hashpower.
I know very little about China, but I remember a podcast from a couple of years ago about how big business works there, and it matches my observations.
Basically, the way it works in China is you throw all of your money at growing your business into a near monopoly. Once you win the war of attrition and all of your significant competitors are bankrupt -- then you can start thinking about turning a profit. Until then it's all losses.
Here is an example from the solar panel industry:
Recall this quote from KNC Mining:


It seems likely that Jihan Wu's strategy is for his company to, for all practical purposes, become the source of **all** of bitcoin's hashpower, and one way or another, collect all of the transaction fees.
If that is the strategy, a couple of things start to make sense:
1. The core developers are a major threat to Bitmain's dominance, because they can code a way out from them if they become abusively rent-seeking or an obvious threat to decentralization, or begin censoring transactions at the request of the Comunist Party. The core developers are the only group in position to credibly lead an initiative to change the POW algorithm for example.
2. The lightning network is an important competitor for fees, and a threat to censorship which must be strangled in the crib. All of the fees must be paid to Bitmain, and it is intolerable for lightning nodes to siphon off fees. All transactions must be subject to a veto from Bitmain -- opaque batching is a no-no.
3. Threats to centralization are irrelevant. Bitmain's ambition is to deal with the trust problem by **winning** and controlling the hash-power. Not by cultivating a decentralized ecosystem and separation of power. For the rest of us, well we have to trust Jihan to act in our best interest.
4. Blocks are going to need to be bigger. MUCH bigger, so that Bitmain can process more and more of the world's transactions and get a larger and larger amount of fees. Your ability to run a full node on your home computer is not a priority.
5. The Chinese government probably doesn't have any problem with this, and possibly is throwing money at Bitmain to make it happen. After all, they will ultimately be able to steer Bitmain, and therefore Bitcoin, in whatever direction is beneficial to the Communist Party.

No! The difficulty for the miners will not go up. The rate that blocks are found will go down, but the rate that each individual miner finds blocks will *not go down* because the difficulty does not change.


Again, this fact does not change the profitability of mining the coin. Only exchange rate, amount of fees and difficulty affect profitability.


You haven't described any reason why they would be losing money.


Note that they are switching to a chain that most miners are not mining. Which makes my point again.


I actually think they will do nothing, unless miners actively attack the legacy chain, in which case they will change the POW.
Bitcoin does not need 144 blocks per day to retain a high market cap, because most of what people use Bitcoin for is trading on exchanges (which doesn't require transactions) and holding their coins (which doesn't require transactions.) Furthermore, segwit is going to double capacity (meaning that we could drop to a block every 20 minutes and have the same capacity) and enable lightning (which will offload a lot of transactions off chain, and could be heavily relied on during a period of slow blocks.)

This is not about whether Bitcoin can improve. This is about doing everything we can to eliminate the possibility of a fork that results in non-fungible tokens.
Any hard fork is going to create the non-trivial potential for someone to continue mining the legacy rules.
I think the default way to do changes that will create invalid blocks from the perspective of un-upgraded nodes, therefore, ought to be to migrate everyone to a merge mined side chain.
Yes, Bitcoin can certainly improve. Migrating to a side chain should be viewed as a superior path to improvement over hard forking.
**Edit:** I think it could be argued, in fact, that segwit is essentially an opt-in merge mined side chain, and that we might be able to do everything this way without ever hard forking.
To argue for a hard fork, I think you need to assume that the legacy chain will probably continue, and then make the argument for why the tokens on the upgraded chain should not be fungible with the legacy chain.
The only time when you wouldn't approach it this way might be when there is some catastrophic problem which is obviously imperative to fix but requires a hard fork. Or possibly (possibly, but probably even this situation is risky) the situation where the changes are utterly boring and could not resonably be expected to form the basis for anybody arguing that the old chain is worth mining.

Also, I think the whole article is resting on the assumption that the fork does not have equal claim to the history of transactions as the legacy chain. If I wanted to argue that the BTC tokens are the "income" and the BCH tokens obtain the legal identity of the coins purchased in the past, what would prove me wrong?

Haha, this is quite a diplomatic way to put it. I have a lot of respect for Peter's ability to think like an adversary, but treechains has always been more of a wistful sigh than a concrete idea. Your observation cuts straight to the point. Miners must fully validate the transactions they mine, so that they know whether or not they are collecting fees. Miners must be able to know whether the block they are mining will be accepted by the network or not. The "center" of the network, therefore, must fully validate all transactions, and the "economic majority" must stand ready to eject invalid chains.

People will be mining the minority coin.


I expect at least 10% of the hashrate to follow Core. That would provide roughly 20 megabytes per day of transactions (14% of today's capacity), and that will be enough to sustain Core until the difficulty drops.
I also expect the market price of Core coins to be higher than the market price of Segwit2x coins, which will cause miners to defect to Core fairly quickly (e.g. within 1-4 days)

I agree that there can be higher layers built on the bitcoin protocol, and I agree that structuring the blockchain as a tree intuitively feels like a step toward a successful sharding strategy, however let me point out that your rejoinder does not address the fundamental problem. The miners who does not wish to rely on trust must fully protect themselves against double-spends in the system of tokens in which they are paid. That implies that the miner must fully process every canonical transaction in the base layer of the currency. That implies that there can be no sharding at the base layer. And that is the model that bitcoin has currently, with all of the consequent scaling challenges. The solution is going to have to involve aggregating transactions in some acceptable way and settling hundreds or thousands of them with every base layer transaction.
At the higher protocol layers, I can see how I could prove that I have coinz, but I cannot see how I can prove to Cherry-sue that I have not spent my higher level coinz to someone else without enumerating all of the transactions that occurred in the higher level and observing that no prior spend exists.

Agreed, there are important differences, and internet bandwidth is it's own beast, particularly when you consider the gradual substitution of fiber optics in place of copper.

I don't want to be overy harsh or have a knee-jerk conclusion drawn from naive analogy that internet bandwidth is going to plateau soon.
However... I see the argument put forward all the time by the folks who are dismissive of the concern about bandwidth that tech inevitably gets better in an exponential way, and I do not think that is a safe assumption at all, especially when you are talking about tech that is deployed for mass consumption -- much less a self evident argument winner that it is sometimes played as.

When you run a full node you get the following benefits:
1. No one can feed you false history, because you have validated all blocks back to genesis. It is not very probable that this attack would happen, but if we are talking about lots of transactions, or lots of money, the risk might be enough to worry about.
2. Because no one can feed you an invalid blockchain, you are helping maintain the integrity of the bitcoin, and confidence in the integrity of bitcoin. The more people fully validate payments, the less likely any invalid-block fraud can be perpetuated by a miner or a man-in-the-middle. Running a fully validating node is good citizenship for this reason, even if you run a pruned node and do not do forward any transactions.
3. Improved privacy, since you will not be sending your transactions to a third party for broadcast. A dedicated attacker could figure out that you were the first node to broadcast a transaction, but at least you aren't giving the info to some rando running an electrum server.
4. If you have a decent internet connection, and are willing to get your hands dirty technically to keep your node running, your operating system patched, and your bitcoin software up-to-date, running a full node can be a way to feel like you are making a positive contribution to the project.
5. Running a full node can be a way to express your opinion during forks.
Are those reasons good enough to justify running a full node? Not for everyone certainly, but for me they are. I've been holding since 2013 and I feel personally invested in the success of the project. I would feel uncomfortable not running a full node, and it gives me a sense of pride to be an actual peer in the peer to peer network.

That's an interesting way of analyzing it -- to say that theft is defined as taking something that "belongs" to someone without their permission, but not assume that theft is not justified.
The part that gets a little sticky in that formulation is in defining exactly when someone owns something and when they do not. Traditionally defining that is the role of the legislature, and a lot of lawyers get involved when you are talking about something more complex than me giving you a beer at a bar, but you could come up with some rules of thumb that would cover most situations.
Edit: For example, what if the United States government asserted that it was a corporation that legally owned all of the land it controlled, and then asked people to pay rent. Would this be not taxation then? It's important to nail down exactly how "ownership" is properly calculated.

Moral reasoning is one of my favorite topics, as you may have guessed. As far as I can tell, morality comes down to the methods humans have for persuading each other that they should behave a certain way. And there are objectively better and worse ways of behaving, based on the desires that people typically share. A moral person, in my definition, is a person who considers the desires of other people to be as important as their own desires and who acts accordingly. Moral evaluation of actions follow from that definition in a way that I find very satisfying and I think most people will.
I find the argument that "taxation is theft" to be an unfair rhetorical move that frames the question in a way that the framer instantly wins without going through the hard work necessary to win legitimately. The right question to ask is not "is taxation theft." The question is "Is taxation good or bad."
Anyway, "theft" is so trite a comparison. And really, taxation would be "robbery" not theft.
But again, the question is really "who has a right to the money?" and that cannot be answered by begging the question.

Absolutely! In fact, since the covert use of ASICBoost cannot easily be detected, one of Bitmain's competitors may already be using it to gain an advantage over Bitmain. They should be pretty excited to keep the competition, many of whom may not hold themselves to the same high ethical standards as Bitmain -- from eating their lunch.  I mean, if people had chips that could be silently flipped into a mode that used less electricity, and no one would be the wiser -- well that would take an exceptionally virtuous miner to abstain from using.

@_date: 2017-04-06 21:18:22
Let's not get carried away here. First of all, no one is using covert AsicBoost. Anyway, there is very little evidence that anyone is using it. More or less the evidence you would expect to find if someone was using it. Except if Bitmain were using it, they would just say so and not tell us they aren't using it. So let's get that straight first off.
Secondly, let's say Bitmain *hypothetically speaking* was using ASICBoost in some of their massive mining facilities that slurp up all of the electrical output of a nearby hydroelectric generator. I'm using my imagination here because we know they aren't. But if they were, and if suddenly they required 25% more electricity to achieve the same hashrate, it wouldn't be totally obvious where all of that spare electricity would be made, or if it would be the most profitable thing to actually run the chips 25% hotter ya dig?

That would be nice -- but I think the most reliable way to help the hungry is to just hand out free food to be eaten on the spot. I guess you could give them a kind of crypto-meal-ticket, but anything that could be transferred could be bartered for something you don't want them to have.
Unless.... Maybe you could make a token that could only be transferred once? They would have to redeem it for food, and could not transfer it. The only way they could give it to someone else would be by revealing the private key to them, and you could tie that to reputation or something.

@_date: 2017-04-06 14:49:14
What I mean, is that users are not going to be motivated to protect the competitive advantage of any particular miner. In fact, what users would prefer is that miners are all roughly equally profitable, because that lowers the chance that a single miner will come to dominate the mining scene.
Users would prefer it if miners could score technical proposals using the method that the users themselves would use. Covert ASIC boost is something some miners may care about, but users do not care about. This misalignment means that these miners and users may disagree about what path to take. Users should find this disagreeable, and should be motivated to make changes to the POW that bring the interests of miners into closer alignment with the interests of users.

Check out my post for more elaboration, but basically the problem is that during a soft fork the blocks they create are considered "bad" by upgraded nodes but "good" by nodes that have not upgraded. If enough miners are SPV mining, they can build on the bad chain for long enough to accidentally split the network. In that scenario, it is even possible that the miners who mined the "good" blocks end up with the worthless coins, depending on whether everyone powers through the soft fork or reverts to the pre-fork rules.
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:03:17
I agree with you on most of this, but I disagree with the drive to say that BIP9 isn't a vote. I think that it's simpler to just say that BIP9 is, as it turns out, a vote, and that is a problem to be tackled.
It's like if someone designed soft forks to be rolled out based on a vote, and then people said "well we don't want it to be done using a vote" and the designer said "No problem, we won't call it a vote!" but didn't actually change anything about the design.
0.14 nodes measure how much hashpower "signals" for segwit, and activate segwit if 95% signal for segwit. To me, it seems straightforward to describe the nodes as implementing a policy in which miners vote. If we want a different activation criteria than miner votes, we need to change the nodes, which is what UASF does.

The fact that there is a high barrier to entry on fabricating ASICS, and a steep  cost to getting chips made with a smaller die **IS** a big problem, and a major contributor to centralization of Bitcoin. And we should eliminate this dynamic if we knew how! Indeed, many coins have tried to find an ASIC-resistant POW.
But this covert ASICBoost technique has three additional properties that should motivate us to take action:
1. ASICBoost is patented
2. Covert ASICBoost is standing in the way of segwit and other improvements
3. Unlike with smaller dies, we can stop this

Fair enough, you are in charge of your own conclusions about what is and is not a problem. Here is an example for your consideration though. You have Wang Chung, who manages F2Pool and controls 36% of the Litecoin hashpower. He has publicly said that he does not own any Litecoin -- in fact, as I understand it, he admitted to *shorting* Litecoin prior to tweeting from time to time.
Wang Chung certainly has a lot of power over Litecoin, but are his desires really the ones we want to be in control of Litecoin?
Personaly, I do not subscribe to the idea that "might makes right", and I think Litecoin will be better if the desires of the users and holders of Litecoin take priority.  Furthermore, I think that in the long run, the desires of the users of a currency *will* take priority over the desires of the miners.

Are you telling me that you think it would take 24 hours to validate a block?
@_date: 2016-02-09 14:46:31


If miners do not have access to or cannot afford a very low-latency internet connection, then they cannot receive and validate the block fast enough to be competitive. Most miners who are not profitable will stop mining.


It is not trivial to receive and validate a block in as close to zero seconds as physically possible


It would prevent bad chains from growing to more than 4 blocks long, and would force miners to deploy code to do the validation. Once they have deployed this code, there is no additional cost to do the validation asap, rather than wait until the last second. Practically speaking, this means that miners will stop mining on an invalid block as soon as they can finish validation, which will usually mean before they have built one block on it.


Thanks for the heads up

I dont have anything against Bitmain designing their chips however they want. Similarly, they should accept that users get to define the protocol any way they want, including to make changes that help erode Bitmain's advantage, or help bring miner incentives into alignment with user incentives.

At 42:50 Peter Todd refers to SPV mining as a "nasty thing" and then at 43:34 he explains why it is nasty, by saying that if one miner screws up, the other miners will follow them.
I keep hearing this, and it's annoying because it seems so obviously wrong.
The July 4th fork which caught everyone with their pants down is a good example of the worst that would happen. In this case, it appears that a 6 block invalid chain happened that penalized F2Pool more than $25,000 for failing to validate.
Such a large invalid chain can easily avoided in the future if miners would just start validating and mining at the same time. It seems likely to me that this is what they are all doing by now, as it is their best option.
Also note: validating nodes would not be fooled by these bad blocks at all. And SPV nodes (which already trust their data sources) could simply politely request that they only be sent data from validated blocks.
So there is really no unmanageable downside with SPV mining, as far as I can see. Maybe can point out where I'm wrong.
And SPV mining makes it possible to start mining immediately, without waiting for the full transmission and validation. Which is a HUGE benefit.
Segregated witness allows an even more attractive scenario.
1. Miners start SPV mining an empty block the moment they receive a solved header.
2.  Miners optionally use bloom filter magic to start including some transactions that they know aren't in the solved block.
3. They receive the complete non-witness message, and they provisionally update their utxo set.
4. Finally, they receive the segregated witness and validate the previous block to ensure that they are not mining a chain that will eventually be abandoned.
The change being proposed here, of requiring that the block demonstrate knowledge of the previous block contents, makes SPV mining impossible and requires the entire block to be communicated before work can begin.
It is imagined that miners will be forced to validate the previous block, but most miners will not be able to validate fast enough to be competitive. There is evidence that this is true even at 1MB. If you enforce this, most miners will end up depending on specialists who are well positioned to validate extremely rapidly and then hand out headers. This is a major new centralization vector if you ask me, and it is in exchange for no practical benefits at all.

Well take up your complaint with the speed of electrons then. Miners cannot receive and validate the block instantly, and ordinary miners will be at a disadvantage to miners who can get a head-start by getting the block faster. They cannot afford to sit on their hands *not hashing* while miners with better internet connections are furiously hashing away. What you will get is miners who will just pay someone else to validate for them.
Why is introducing anything that allows miners to "make progress" toward solving a block a deadly sin, but this proposal, which allows certain miners (especially the one who solved the last block and already has it and knows that it is valid) to get a head start is a-ok?
From a practical point of view, miners who are forced to validate B - 4 will just go ahead and validate immediately. The software would be there, ready to go; there is no point putting it on a delay, and once they discover a bad block there is no point building on it.

You said that the fee should be byte for byte, but you didn't specify which bytes you were talking about. I said mempool but I misspoke. What I meant was UTXO database.
Unspent transaction bytes are arguably the most important bytes. They need to be stored in RAM, partly because miners need to be able to call on them to validate and construct blocks quickly to preserve decentralization, and partly because all full nodes would take a big performance hit if UTXOs had to be read off disk. RAM is far more expensive than hard disk space.
Also, as you pointed out, witness data can always be pruned as soon as it is used to validate a block. Admittedly your node cannot help other nodes bootstrap if you prune all of the witness data, but you can still fully validate the blockchain and know that everything is there, and fully validate future blocks.
So witness data does not consume any of the most expensive resource (UTXO RAM) and can optionally consume very little of the cheap resource (hard drive). It is this difference that creates an economic distortion if you apply equal weight to witness and non witness data.

That is not necessarily true. Being a miner does not mean that you have invested in Bitcoin. It means that you have invested in  *mining equipment*. When the price of bitcoin goes up, it makes the hash rate go up, which makes your mining equipment find a block less often. If segwit kills your ability to use ASICBoost covertly, this could also drastically reduce the value of your investment. And please stop implying that I not aware that I could be wrong. I get it. I can be wrong. You can be wrong. That isn't an argument one way or the other.

So you gotta be careful when you say that if bitcoin needs inflation, it has failed. Bitcoin uses inflation to distribute the coins, and Bitcoin uses inflation to subsidize security during this period in which transaction fees cannot generate adequate security. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has not failed.


Bitcoin consists of many goals, some of which have to be balanced against each other. Why should I think that when the system is mature the transaction fees will be adequate? Because you say so? Because that was Satoshi's guess? Shouldn't I (and shouldn't you) be open to the possibility that the market cannot ever generate enough revenue from transaction fees alone? Savers get a free ride -- the security that guards their money is paid for by the people who are making lots of transactions. Why would you expect a market with a built in free-rider problem to operate properly?
After all, in the only world we can observe, the one we live in, the world of today, the market as a matter of fact *cannot* generate enough security by transaction fees alone, and bitcoin does have inflation to pay for security. So you are talking about a hypothetical world here without backing it up with any reasoning or evidence -- just assertions.


I agree with you, but I'm talking about a particular scenario. In the scenario I am contemplating, let's say 2 more halvings have passed. The block reward is 3.125 bitcoins. And crucially, in this scenario we assume that transaction fees have not picked up the slack, and there is general agreement that there is not enough mining to really secure the system. You can talk about a different scenario if you want. That's great. Yes, in a scenario in which transaction fees are high enough, we can afford not to have any inflation, and it would be pointless to pay for more security than we need.


Or not. For example, the inflation number could be done with a vote weighted by stake and by time. This could work well with lightning, where people routinely lock bitcoins for periods of time. E.g. if I lock 1 bitcoin for 30 days, I could say I think .5% inflation is the right amount. My vote would be cast for .5%, and be weighted by 1 bitcoin and by 30 days. It would be summed up with other votes happening at the same time to determine the proper mining subsidy. (For safety, you could have a 1% inflation limit you don't exceed no matter what the voting says.)


Satoshi envisioned having enough mining to secure the network. Also, I think Satoshi was sophisticated enough to admit when he guessed wrong about something and make a change.


This is just a trick of language. 


By who? By God? By Satoshi? Who cares? The current users of bitcoin can use it for whatever they want, according to any rules they please, and that is what they *will* do. Passive voice about some unnamed entity that never meant to change something about bitcoin doesn't impress me.

Unless we are in a soft fork, the network is not harmed when miners do not validate, because full nodes will just throw away the incredibly expensive invalid blocks, and SPV clients can request that the block be marked as validated or not validated. Sure, people could lie to the SPV client, which is why they need to connect to several peers.
Miners need to validate during a soft fork, because the network is only partially upgraded and is extremely reliant on the miners.
Also, I apologize for the internet equivalent of yelling, as your response was reasonable in the face of a proposal that miners do not need to validate. I deserved the downvote.

The reason you want to pick exactly 1 candidate is that you do not want the miners to have a choice about which PoS block to mine on top of. If there are two candidates, miners could choose the one they find most favorable. If miners have this power, then minters will have a reason to make their block favorable to miners, which defeats the point of this design. As a strategy to get exactly 1 qualified candidate we are going to score all candidates and pick the one with the highest score.
It is true that during this scoring step the candidates cannot be hidden. If a candidate were hidden, it introduces the possibility that everyone will make a mistake about which candidate has the highest score. However, it is not necessary to hide the candidates in order to prevent the miners from censoring them. You can make it so that the miners do not *want* to censor them. For example, if creating a bitcoin transaction makes you a candidate, then the only way miners could censor candidates would be to prevent everyone from making transactions except for the miner themselves. Obviously the miners are not going to want to do this, since if they did no one could buy and use the Bitcoins being mined.
I do worry about other things with this design though. For one, I worry that the scoring calculation would take a long time. Right now there are about 60 million utxos. A normal CPU could maybe do 30 megahash/s? So that means the scoring step takes around 2 seconds!
For another, I worry that many PoS blocks would simply never be created, because the owner of the coins would not be paying attention when their opportunity happened.
Both of these problems can be somewhat mitigated by reducing the set of candidates. For example, you could say you only consider the utxos created recently (last 200 days) and only the utxos that hold most of the bitcoins (e.g. sort the utxos from the last 200 days by size and pick the largest of them until you have selected 50% of the satoshis)

Nah, it's not that bad. Especially not compared to "microbitcoins."

You could say the same thing about "dollars." Where I come from, people seldom say "That costs one hundred thousand dollars."

Banks are much more highly regulated than private individuals are. Maybe I can help fix your analogy a bit:


It would be risky, but I expect it would probably work out just fine.
Perhaps more importantly, while it might be tricky to get the bank to give me large quantities of federal reserve notes in the USA, I *can* purchase $10,000 of gold coins whenever I want, or silver coins, or bulk copper, or resalable corn, or oil, or used cars, or firearms, or for that matter Bitcoin, whenever I please, and I don't see that changing any time soon.

On Wikipedia, it says that:


Therefore NAP is *defined* by with an exception for property. I think this introduces a fundamental confusion into what we are talking about which is problematic.
In one way of nailing down the NAP to some specific concept: by including an exception for property, it just makes the NAP a meaningless rule. It's like saying "I think people should not hurt other people, except in cases where they should hurt people." and then never getting around to defining what those cases are.
The more straightforward way to define aggression would be to say that it is the initiation of violence, or to credibly threaten to initiate violence unless someone behaves a certain way. In that case, the above definition isn't meaningless, it is incoherent. It's like saying that the non-aggression principle is that it is wrong to initiate violence, and that it is also not wrong to initiate violence.
To give you another analogy to help you get a feel for how the NAP sounds like weird doublespeak to me, consider if the United States issued a proclamation back in 1830 called the "Non Aggression Commitment (NAC)." This proclamation stated that the united states will never initiate violence against the native Americans, unless the native Americans violated Unites States territory, which extended to the Pacific Ocean.

My problem with NAP being the sum total of a metaethics is that (if actually applied) it makes the concept of property meaningless. You are able to see that clearly with copyright, e.g. don't watch "my" movie, but the same idea applies with physical property, e.g. don't walk on "my" beach. Don't drive "my" car.
What "Property" is, partly, is the definition of when it is ok to use violence to stop someone from using something.
To me, ancaps want it both ways, like someone who believes in the NAP, but thinks it's ok to "defend my honor, it It is attacked" or "defend my way of life" if attacked" or "defend my god against blasphemers".
In other words, they say they value the non aggression principle, but they unconsciously subscribe to a different set of values.

Based on the traffic charts you see posted here on periodically I would guess that typical full nodes serve approximately 1 million blocks per month -- or in other words 1,000 GB pre segwit and potentially 1,700 - 1,800 GB from now on. That is **uploading** approximately [10 times more data]( than an average home in the USA **downloads** per month, so you can bet that Bitcoin users stick out like a sore thumb to ISPs.
I haven't done the research, honestly, but my guess would be that normal people would not run nodes anymore if we were producing 10 MB blocks, and small businesses would outsource the task to a trusted 3rd party, who would be a tempting target for litigation and regulation. The number of full nodes would shrink to a couple hundred at most, run by die hards and bitcoin-specific businesses, making the coin much more vulnerable to being attacked or hijacked, seriously damaging its value proposition.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:05:25


Yes, but for two examples that serve US clients -- and possibly will underpin a lot of institutional investment next year, Coinbase and Gemini, have both said that they will give the BTC ticker to the chain with the most accumulated work, even if it is not the chain with the legacy rules. Under that policy, if we change the POW, we are instantly disqualified from being considered BTC. I think that is wrong, and I'm trying to show my reasoning for why it would be wrong.


In the scenario we are discussing, both dominant chains would be "invalid" from the perspective of pre-fork clients. So how do you determine what the new "valid" is? You say "The chain that forked defensively in response to a hostile external force." No problem, says Roger Ver. Segwit2x is a defensive fork in response to the hostile takeover attempt by Blockstream, who have smothered and subverted Satoshi's perfect vision. See what I mean when I say "ambiguous?"

If we have above a certain hash rate (e.g. 20% or more) probably the best thing is just to wait it out. If hash rate goes to low, the best thing would probably be an EDA. If the other miners mine disruptive blocks on the BTC chain, obviously there is no choice other than to change the POW. Which would make me sad for the SHA256 miners who just want to mine Bitcoin and get hurt, but I would be very happy to see the big pools get the door slammed after they exit.

You listed the following disadvantages of OPENDIME:
1. not reusable
2. unable to recover key onto a device
3. private key has to be revealed to a PC which can be a security risk.
4. supports only Bitcoin and Litecoin recently
5. the design might not be appealing to everyone
I think the Opchip addresses some of these:
1. Is reusable
2. Still cannot make a backup. You lose it -- it's lost.
3. Designed to plug into a hardware wallet, not a computer
4. Supports any coin that supports hash locks
5. More freedom in design because verification is done electronically not by visual inspection
I actually imagined this being a kind of removable media cartridge that you can plug into your hardware wallet. The hardware wallet does the necessary verification, protects your laptop from untrusted hardware, and automates the process.
You say OPENDIME can be easily verified visually. I disagree with that. Visual inspection doesn't actually get you anything. You have to plug the OPENDIME into a computer to really know that it is not counterfeit, that it is still sealed, and what address it has the private key to sign for. Also, you need to look up the current balance of that address, so there is going to be a computer involved in the transaction.

The problem is that there is equivocation on the word "hurt". If I say that I will not "hurt" people with my fists, unless they "hurt" my feelings with my words, am I implementing something that can be called "a non-aggression principle" with a straight face?
If I say I will not "hurt" people by beheading them unless they "hurt" my religious experience by drawing a prophet, is that non-aggression?
If I say I will not "hurt" people by throwing them in a cage unless they "hurt" me by walking into my penthouse apartment, which I never visit because it is an investment property, and then attempt to defend themselves from police officers who are physically assaulting them?
What if someone "hurts" my ability to walk on my beachfront property alone? What if someone "hurts" my reputation by making a secret about me public, or by claiming something about me which is untrue? What if someone "hurts" my safety by cutting corners and selling a seat belt that fails, or by driving drunk down the highway? What if someone "hurts" my ability to make a living by writing by selling bootleg copies of my book? What if someone hurts my ability to create a brand that people trust by putting my logo on an inferior product?
None of these things involve other people doing violence to me, or threatening to do violence with me, but through the magic pixie dust of careful definition, all of these could be thought of as "aggression" and could justify a physically violent response from me or my delegate without me being defined as the initiator of violence.
In other words, this boils down to saying that it's ok to initiate physical violence, so long as the other party "started it" by ... doing something that did not involve physical violence.
So many complex real-world scenarios, which grappling with as a practical matter results in the criminal and civil justice systems and representative legislature as a way to make laws that make sense and track the desires of people generally. -- all get sidestepped by just glossing over everything and uselessly abstracting everything away.

It's not a plausible scenario. Most nodes are going to receive the block and never send anything. And you aren't counting transactions that are broadcast but never get mined. 


Visa is a for profit, regulated financial service business and can afford giant data centers, so they can afford all of that. I doubt they are moving 7,000 petabytes per month though. (5000 nodes moving 1.5 petabyte monthly each, which is 1.5 GB times the observed 1 million blocks per month) Bitcoin has small transactions, but is disgustingly redundant.
I'm not opposed to 8MW blocks, but it seems to me that we ought to hang out at 4MW for a while and see what it's like.

Here's what I think will happen.
1. Fork happens in mid-November.
2. Hashrate splits to something like 20% Legacy and 80% Segwit2x.
3. After 24 hours, price settles at around $4000 Legacy and $1000 Segwit2x.
4. Segwit2x becomes the longest work chain.
5. Segwit2x price rises to $2500 and Legacy coin falls to $3000.
6. I sell my Segwit2x coins for Legacy coins.
7. In less than 4 weeks the hash-power shifts to about 60% Legacy and 40% Segwit2x.
8. Legacy becomes the longest work chain and Segwit2x never recovers that title.
9. Slow bleed down for Segwit2x price and hashrate.
10. Legacy coins resume upward march to $6000.
I think things are going to come out fine and by January it should be crystal clear that the Legacy coin is what most people will call Bitcoin.

Three ideas similar to what you are proposing are are coinjoins with Schnorr signatures, which you may be able to do in Bitcoin by the end of next year after the Taproot bip gets activated, or cut-through transactions, which you can do on mimblewimble and which makes the Grin blockchain (for example) remain small. I don't think there are any plans to try to compress ECDSA signatures -- especially with Schnorr coming.
The other possibility is called payjoin, where you enter into a coinjoin with the recipiant, and which might save bytes sometimes by reducing change outputs.

I like precision. I feel that being careful to only say things that are correct has many benefits. It can help refine your concepts, avoid mistakes, and keep you from being trapped by your words.
So when you say that "Governments making bitcoin illegal" is the  threat to Bitcoin, I take you seriously, and will engage with what you said.
That is a somewhat nebulous and unsettling scenario you are referring to, but let's put our feelings about it into perspective. Nuclear armageddon would be worse for Bitcoin, and is arguably a more probable event than that "governments" (all of them?) would outlaw "Bitcoin".
Litecoin too? Monero? All crypto-currency? All peer-to-peer business interactions that involve a cryptographically secured data structure? What is the language that captures the intent and justification, and doesn't simultaneously announce it's own totalitarian mainsprings?
The USA is so dedicated to free speech that the legislature cannot even pass a law preventing Russia and Saudi Arabia from running advertisements to tell Americans which president to vote for, so I see banning crypto as pretty implausible for now here. Perhaps similar in probability that banning cryptography that lacks a government backdoor.


That is not the question for you. The question for you is, would you get into bitcoin to avoid having your life savings confiscated for the 'greater good' (e.g. to recapitalize JP Morgan) or inflated away?
In the places where the government is tempted to make crypto illegal, citizens must grapple with these questions, not with whether to buy acid online.

No, my whole point is that payment processors should try a different business model, as the current one does not appear to be effective. Rather than give the merchants a favorable rate, payment processors should charge merchants a rate that is competitive with other payment processors and give customers a favorable rate.
After all, this is what credit card companies do. They give bonuses to the customers to entice them, they do not distribute them as savings to the merchant.
The savings to the customer come from replacing an expensive payment processor (VISA) with a cheaper one, and an inefficient security model (credit cards and chargebacks) with an efficient security model, and an expensive option that the customer may not care about (3rd party chargeback arbitration) with the cheaper option to request a refund from the merchant.

This seems like a plausible scenario. The counter-argument would be that citizens of nations with crappy currencies might have options other than Bitcoin available to them. For example, they may be able to buy dollars, or whatever fiat currency dethrones the dollar. It's really a fascinating question that hinges on how volatile bitcoin will be, and whether or not local governments will take effective measures to discourage the use of fiat alternatives to their own bad currency. Bitcoin is probably well positioned to operate in the context of a hostile, weak government.

But to answer your question, suppose a ruling came out from fincen saying that miners who have control over the contents of a block are classified as money transmitters. This would not require any new laws even, just an opinion from fincen. Then the pool operators would have to comply with US law, or be jailed. At that point, these pool operators could be told that they should only include transactions that include identity information to comply with KYC laws. The pool operators could be told that they should not build on any block mined by a non-licensed entity. etc. etc.

I didn't realize I was talking to an actual merchant who has actually accepted bitcoins, so let me elaborate.
As you no doubt know, there is no point in asking merchants to accept bitcoin if there are no customers who want to use bitcoin to buy things. That is why I don't think the strategy of giving merchants a cheap payment processing method is effective.
You have to figure out some way to make customers want to pay in bitcoin. Once they want that, then merchants will have a reason to add bitcoin as a payment option. Even if the costs are similar to Visa, if enough customers like using bitcoin, merchants will be willing to accommodate them.

Could be, but I think what he wants is for people to develop technical solutions to the vulnerabilities he sees, rather than take the "easy way out" and resolve them with political consensus. Bitcoin's core value proposition, in Peter's view, is that it is protected from being controlled by the state and therefore saddled with the expensive responsibility to police its users. If bitcoin leans too much on political workarounds to function, then it will eventually just become subject to the same responsibilities as legacy systems and will consequently be out competed by more efficient, centralized, permission-based systems.
As a political actor, you might not want the world to go that way, because societies need to enable dissent to remain capable of positive change.

has one the brightest strategic minds in Bitcoin, but too stubborn to get talked out of a bad idea sometimes. I think this is one of those times.
A simple, sudden change to a new PoW would impose a large cost on big and small miners -- but it is the big, well capitalized miners who would be best positioned to increase the proportion of hash rate they control as a result.
Big miners might not *want* this outcome. They want more **profit**, not necessarily more percent of the hashrate. Too large influence over the hashrate has downsides for miners. Above 50% they just raise the difficulty against themselves. Close to 50% they make themselves targets for regulators, bring on bitter criticism from the community, and undermine confidence in Bitcoin.
The prospect of a PoW change means spending a ton of money buying new hardware, for little upside -- especially for big miners who are close to the 50% ceiling. Even if, when the dust settles, their share of the hashpower increases, it may not be enough to recover the costs of the new hardware. So a PoW change could be bad for Bitcoin *and* bad for Bitmain. On the other hand, they may like it because they could sell the new miners to everyone else...
It is totally reasonable to presume that a company like Bitmain, located close to the hardware production, with all of that money, and relationships, and experience, would be the first company to fabricate ASICS for any of the proposed algorithms. In fact, they may be the only company with the motivation and enough resources to do the engineering work on multiple PoW candidates before the hardfork even happens, and then go to production with the winner immediately. At which point every miner around the world will line up at their door to pay them to replace their now worthless SHA256 hardware. And the suddenly worthless GPU rigs that they just bought a couple of months prior.
They have a freaking engineering pipeline for making algorithms into asics, and according to their website already have miners specialized to SHA256, Scrypt, x11, Blake, CryptoNight, Ethhash and Equihash. These miners all look almost exactly the same.  A PoW change would not change anything about their manufacturing process other than to email a different CAD file to the chip foundry.
So no, this idea has far too much risk of backfiring spectacularly  and burning small miners while giving Bitmain the best possible opportunity to increase their dominance.
I've heard Luke float other ideas like having competitors include secret extra code for doing alternative algorithms that users could come to consensus on. Calling this kind of idea half-baked would be generous. Likewise with grasping for straws with optical computing or other exotic fabrication techniques that hope to do something other than giving the network to Bitmain on a silver platter, but which really just introduce a lot of new uncertainty about what can go wrong.
This is just a failure to think adversarially -- like thinking you will win a fight by punching the other guy. Bitmain is ready to punch back, and they are the Mike Tyson in this area.
TLDR: Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.

Multinational corporations only run on a profit model in the context of there being state-enforced property rights. What corporations, and any other dynamically stable entity, really runs on is a survival model.
In the context of a state, profit determines survival, because wealth confers ownership, which allows you to request that the state defend your stuff. Outside the context of a state, there is no such thing as profit, because property is not a meaningful concept when, for example, there is no government to look at the deed to your house or the invoice to your machinery and be thereby persuaded that you are entitled to have it be defended. In the absence of a government, physical force determines survival.

I said "things that are not happening but theoretically could."
Governments are not making Bitcoin illegal. They theoretically could.
Also, we have *used* nukes during wartime, and come to within a hair's breadth of nuclear armageddon more than once, so I don't know why you think mocking the analogy makes any sense.
Finally, it is not clear that making Bitcoin illegal would cause people to stop using Bitcoin. It depends on whether people feel like they need to use Bitcoin. If they really want to use it, they will use it, like with drugs, and the technology will make it very hard to find and punish them.
If they don't want it very badly, then it doesn't even matter very much that it is illegal.

Yes, you will want to make sure that each of your 2^160 private keys are equally likely to generate any of the 2^160 addresses or there is a problem.
I'm resting on the assumption that SHA256 (which your random seed goes into) actually outputs to 2^256 with a flat distribution. Again, I'm not the most qualified to evaluate that assumption (probably very few people are!) but I'm satisfied with it.
Perhaps I should publish those caveats when I mention 2^160 -- but I feel justified in saying that your coins are very likely protected at 2^160.

I'd define a failure of bitcoin as being one of either two things:
1. Bitcoin converts to a closed, permission based system. It is no longer possible for Joe Shmoe to just start up a mining rig and anonymously mine for whatever blocks he pleases, and have a proportional chance to get on the chain. Joe needs to go ask someone for permission to do this.
2. Mining reward becomes so small that attackers are able to destabilize the system through mining attacks. E.g. they short the currency and then mine empty blocks to stop transactions.

They are perfectly welcome to use some other definition. This is the definition I use, and I think it is a good one.
Or did you mean that there are people who do not agree with the social/political consensus about what should and should not be owned? Well, then there is a disagreement. What more can I say about it? These people are mining on their own chain so to speak, and that is something that happens.

Default max peer slots for a full node is 128, but peers come and go, and most are leechers. I'm reasoning from measurements of actual node traffic in my comment.
Even if you figure serving 140k blocks per month, that's ~250 gigs uploaded per month. That buys us like 7 on-chain transactions per second.
It is a design that fundamentally does not scale. It's like if the way email worked was that you downloaded all emails sent by everyone and then scanned the pile looking for yours.
You gotta find ways to not need to look at every transaction, and that means you need to take transactions off chain. If you consider every BTC&lt;-&gt;USD trade on every exchange to be a bitcoin transaction, we already support hundreds or thousands of transactions per second. It's just off chain, so it doesn't screw over node operators.
People have done research into this and figured out how many nodes will stop validating at various block sizes. There was a paper at a bitcoin conference a couple of years ago that made similar conclusions, that is to say the system changes form drastically in the 5 to 10 MB range. I don't recall the specific numbers.

Meaning that if at some hypothetical point in the future, the blockchain that most people look at to determine whether or not someone has paid them has blocks in it that require permission to create, then bitcoin will have failed at achieving its original goals, and will likely get out-competed by cheaper systems to the point where usage will go down year after year until having bitcoins doesn't have any value because so few people want them.

That's fine, but it isn't a lie, and I didn't feel any need to defend that idea because you didn't say what you found wrong about it, except to say that it was wrong.
I am referring specifically to the libertarians I hear around here who say that their guiding principle is non-aggression, but who nonetheless think private property is a good thing. Property does not scale to large groups of people without the credible threat of the initiation of violence, and these people choose not to acknowledge this fact.
This is their blind spot, and it causes them to not appreciate that while it is far from perfect, government to a very great extent reduces violence and prevents strong people from preying on weak people. Abolishing government functions without installing substitutes that have been demonstrated to be effective is just what these feudal lords are hoping will happen, because it amplifies their power at the expense of weaker people. Naive libertarians are unfortunately playing right into the hands of these powermongers.

This would only be true if the miners never validated the blocks. I am saying they should start mining immediately and validate when the full block arrives. If the block is invalid then of course they stop mining it as soon as they know. This should have no impact on spv nodes.

I don't think you are picking up what I am putting down yet. We did not get a chain of 6 invalid blocks *that way* as in, the way I am proposing. If miners start validating mining and also validating simultaneously, then they will know they have an invalid block within a few minutes and will be rationally motivated to stop mining. They would never mine on a bad block for more than the time required to receive and validate the block, and they certainly would never mine on a chain with an invalid block a few blocks back.
Also, I disagree that miners can save *a lot of complexity* by not validating at all. It's not that complex to run a full node, even as a non miner with no economic incentive to do so. And it does not cost any time if you start mining and validating simultaneously.
Finally, as your 6 block example shows, it may not be realistic to expect miners to validate before they begin mining. Maybe software should accommodate the more realistic scenario of mining immediately.

No one that I know of is making a hardware wallet that works this way, but I think this is the absolute gold standard for secure cold storage. And it's something that a person who is not technically capable can do.
Just tell them to roll a die 50 times and type it into the wallet. Wallet then shows you a mnemonic seed to write down and lets you type in an index to the address that you want. Type the index and it produces the private key and the address.
Turn off the device and it forgets the key.
Sure, it's not that convenient or sexy but god damn is it simple and secure. Holographic foil, signed firmware and power-up SRAM are all good, but I feel best if the device just performs a deterministic operation on a random value you yourself provide.

Which is what makes it ironic that many of you have a big blind spot when it comes to property rights.


I said that many of the libertarian folks have a blind spot with respect to property. I did not say all do, and I would need to evaluate each person's opinion on a case by case basis to tell the difference. Also, this smells a bit like argumentum ad populum to me.


You appear to have high confidence about your guesses about my personal history, yet you do not have evidence to justify your confidence. Which is the mistake that you are accusing me of making.


Just because you disagree with someone does not show that the other person is a liar or a spreader of lies. People honestly disagree with each other. Give people the benefit of the doubt. You may one of these days find out that you are actually wrong about something.


This is a bit like saying that a person is not an actual thing, but just a concept used to describe a bunch of cells. Or saying that the blockchain is not an actual thing, but just a concept used to refer to a bunch of blocks. It is legitimate and necessary to talk about collections of things as things in and of themselves, and to think about the properties that emerge (or at least become recognizable) at higher levels of organization.


I don't think about it that way. To me, a theory is a model of reality that predicts which futures can or cannot happen. "Property" is more like a way of talking about the future that we prefer, rather than the future we predict.


I agree that rights, the way most people think about them, are an illusion. When I say "rights" I am usually referring to whatever the consensus currently is about what the appropriate treatment of people is. Or at most, I'm talking about systems of dealing with people that tend to avoid outcomes that we would (generally speaking) consider terrible. I'm not talking about some kind of god-given or transcendent entity.

No need to apologize, and the answer is not simple.
When you run a full node you get the following benefits:
1. No one can feed you false history, because you have validated all blocks back to genesis. It is not very probable that this attack would happen, but if we are talking about lots of transactions, or lots of money, the risk might be enough to worry about.
2. Because no one can feed you an invalid blockchain, you are helping maintain the integrity of the bitcoin, and confidence in the integrity of bitcoin. The more people fully validate payments, the less likely any invalid-block fraud can be perpetuated by a miner or a man-in-the-middle. Running a fully validating node is good citizenship for this reason, even if you run a pruned node and do not do forward any transactions.
3. Improved privacy, since you will not be sending your transactions to a third party for broadcast. A dedicated attacker could figure out that you were the first node to broadcast a transaction, but at least you aren't giving the info to some rando running an electrum server.
4. If you have a decent internet connection, and are willing to get your hands dirty technically to keep your node running, your operating system patched, and your bitcoin software up-to-date, running a full node can be a way to feel like you are making a positive contribution to the project.
5. Running a full node can be a way to express your opinion during forks.
Are those reasons good enough to justify running a full node? Not for everyone certainly, but for me they are. I've been holding since 2013 and I feel personally invested in the success of the project. I would feel uncomfortable not running a full node, and it gives me a sense of pride to be an actual peer in the peer to peer network.

Like "intrinsic value", "fundamentals" is a term with extremely high potential for generating confusion. If you have a precise technical definition for "fundamentals" I suppose you may not blow your fingers off. Perhaps you can explain to me what "fundamental value" is and how it is distinguished from, say "what people are typically willing to give in trade". Is there a particular scientific instrument I can use to measure a kilogram of petroleum to determine whether it has more or less "fundamentals" than a kilogram of plutonium, or a kilogram of van Gogh paintings? Or is "fundamentals" merely a way to win the argument by definition, by smuggling in a conceptual framework in which your view is the correct one?


Are there not currency ETFs? Is Bitcoin not a currency? I don't see how I'm shifting away from the topic.




Only if you are a motivated to cherry pick. The average daily price in 2013 was $186. The average daily price in 2016 was $516. Different people will draw different conclusions from the chart, but to me it appears reasonable to say that bitcoin is structured in such a way as to retain value over time.

Then keep the block subsidy. Quit being dogmatic about this.   Savers, not just transactors, enjoy the security bitcoin offers. Savers, not just transactors, should fund it. It is fair, it is workable, and I believe it must happen if bitcoin is to continue operating safely.
One proposal: From block 630,000 to 839,999 the subsidy will be 6.25 BTC per block. That works out to 1.7% inflation at the last block. Starting at block 840,000, rather than dropping to 3.125, instead drop to 3.9 BTC and let the block reward be 1% inflation per year.
1% could be made a hard cap, and we could take a vote to determine the desired inflation rate. The vote could be weighted based on coin age, so that savers (as a group) have direct control over how much security they want to purchase.
More points:
1. Bitcoins are destroyed over time by being lost, converted to un-spendable dust, or burned. These coins are, as far as purchasing power is considered, subtracted from the nominal inflation rate of 1%.
2. If the original idea was to emulate gold, well this still sticks to that vision. Gold, after all, has something like a permanent inflation tail, rather than topping out at some particular tonnage.
3. Inflation is an important part of bitcoin. The current inflation rate is about 4%. Everyone accepts, this, so everyone accepts that inflation is a necessary evil. All that is left is to determine what amount inflation is necessary, which is an empirical question, not an ideological question.
4. The argument that changing the inflation rate violates the "social contract" of bitcoin is invalid. First of all, the term "social contract" refers to the willingness of individuals to submit to government because they realize that it is the only way that society is going to function. So I'm not sure that the libertarians really want to have that concept around. I understand that they want a respectable sounding label for what they are trying to say, but "social contract" is the wrong label. Secondly, what they really mean is that bitcoiners bought bitcoin because they thought that they were getting a particular inflation curve. To that I say boo hoo. Bitcoiners who thought that Satoshi's inflation curve produced a secure cryptocurrency made an error. This is the same type of argument the crowd makes when they say they bought into a bitcoin where infinite secure on-chain scaling is a reality. Boo hoo. Nobody has invented that yet. Get over it.
5. It is irrational to dogmatically insist on Satoshi's inflation schedule, if it destroys the security of bitcoin. The point should be to have a peer to peer cash system and store of value that continues to exist indefinitely, not to nobly go down with the ship when we discover that Satoshi's design choices are unsustainable.

Both derive their worth primarily from the expectation that there will be buyers in the future. That doesn't make bitcoin a ponzi or a security. That is just a fundamental property that all stores of value share.
Additionally, both have a non-monetary use case. For gold you might say jewelry. For bitcoin you might say cross-border immediate payment, or publishing data to the global immutable ledger. Both of these functions are valuable regardless of the monetary value. i. e.  bitcoins would have a price even if you used them as a kind of stamp with which to transfer dollars.
Edit: jstolfi might be consistent, so long as he would argue similarly that GLD and SLV should have never been approved.

Are you willing to assert the contrary? That if we switched to zero inflation today, bitcoin would be ok?
Is 10 years distant enough for you? In 10 years inflation falls below 1%.


Yet Satoshi was unable to engineer around inflation, and no one has come up with a plausible replacement for it, if transaction fees do not do the job.


There is no worthwhile distinction to be made here.
@_date: 2016-10-21 17:48:47


Yes, but the point is that if we learn that those features cannot all be delivered, we should be willing, in principle, to make compromises. Compromise can be good, if the situation you can achieve via compromise is better than the situation you can achieve by insisting that no changes be made.

Two more points:
1. Bitcoin and gold could be considered a worthwhile thing to own despite the fact that they cannot produce any new wealth, and with no expectation of selling to a "greater fool". The useful service they provide while being held is simply to enable delayed consumption. This is a critical service that everyone requires, and a person could rationally be willing to pay for it if necessary. They may consider the risks of volatility, or even some degree of loss of purchasing power the price they pay to be able to defer consumption.
2. Insofar as bitcoin functions as a free floating currency, it has the attributes you describe -- fat profits can be made if its value changes relative to other currencies, and it could incur utter loss of value in some scenarios. You judge central banks to be competent to preserve the value of the currencies under their stewardship, but that is not an uncontested or self evident proposition, and there are many counter examples that could be cited where central banks were not able to stabilize the value of a currency. Other people predict that the structure of Bitcoin is such that it will demonstrate the ability to retain value indefinitely. Whether you place your confidence in central banks or game theory/algorithmic scarcity/network effect is and should be your call to make.
It is not desirable for "the authorities" to always and everywhere be charged with deciding what is good for society and what is bad. Better is when there is a healthy tension between the authorities and the emergent behavior of the masses. Structure is good, but a little chaos is also required if we are to have positive change. Both are good, which is why I welcome your comments to the SEC, but I still do disagree with them, and I hope someone is able to do a convincing job responding to them.

First of all, it's an honor to be speaking with the lightning guy.
As to what we can do, I think the answer depends on what role we are playing. I do not yet see the harm in advocating the following:
If you are a miner: If someone else broadcasts a header for the block you are mining, and the POW satisfies the target, drop what you are doing and mine the new header whether you have validated the block or not. Validate it as soon as possible, and if it is invalid or builds on an invalid chain, stop mining it.
If you are a developer of mining software -- implement the above policy as default.
If you are a bitcoin researcher -- check that the above policy does not have other subtle, terrible game theoretic consequences.
People cannot be counted on to be sensible, but they can usually be counted on to be lazy. So if the applications, frameworks and libraries implement good policies out of the box, and the policies are compatible with what is economically rational for miners to do, I think it will be ok.

I can imagine three scenarios where it might be useful.
1. You do not have internet access, and you don't have any pre-arranged agreements for relaying your transactions. You could broadcast your transaction by ham radio. You could receive the blockchain via satellite broadcast or tv-tower broadcast. This depends on such infrastructure existing of course!
2. You don't have reliable internet access. Maybe it's filtered somehow.
3. You don't want to trust anyone. No tor and no trusted nodes. Maybe you are prevented from using tor somehow. No one could use any kind of analysis to trace the origination of the transaction back to you. You just take a portable radio to a public place and you broadcast from there.

Yes, which could conceivably make the data-farm architecture that does not monetize the waste heat unprofitable.


Presumably most data furnaces would not run a fully validating node, so it may be sufficient to hijack the pool operator nodes, which would be fewer in number.


Another target to shoot for is that the consent of representatives of different kinds of people is required before a change can be made. You want to aim for good coverage of the desires of the participants, so that a subset cannot roll out rules that favor themselves at the expense of others.


Yes, it will be very interesting to see how the transition to fees happens. That's one of the major chasms Bitcoin must cross on its way to world domination, and perhaps the biggest remaining question mark.


Yes. Although the mining effort will continue to waste energy equivalent to the entire block reward, no matter how efficiently they hash, and no matter how efficiently they can use the heat generated by the rigs -- nevertheless they may waste less and less energy as the block reward goes down, while achieving higher and higher hashrates and possibly better security.

If people made an error in predicting what bitcoin would be, then that is their failure.

Would be nice if running a full node were required in order to mine so that getblocktemplate was the norm. To me, that seems like a superior solution versus making block rewards undetectably steal-able, which would kill off pools, the only currently viable solution to the variance problem.

@_date: 2016-10-13 21:05:06


That sounds like a sensible definition to me. I would reiterate that at least a few legitimate sources of fundamental demand (so defined) could be said to exist for bitcoin:
1. To facilitate delayed consumption by protecting purchasing power over time. A person could be of the opinion that it is "stupid" to buy anything other than dividend paying stocks to preserve your wealth. Other people prefer to hold some percentage of bonds, money market funds, precious metals, collectibles, treasuries, TIPS, or just cash. The particular mix you hold depends on your beliefs and the particulars of your situation. Bitcoin offers a unique mixture of properties (e.g. a known inflation schedule, the ability to store any amount on a small scrap of paper) that people might desire. None of this depends on demanding a positive return on investment, only the preservation of purchase power.
2. To pay miners to append to the blockchain. Only time will reveal the value of this service, but it's easy to imagine someone wanting to do it. (e.g. to prove the existence of a document at a particular point in time)
3. To do what bitcoin is designed to do -- facilitate the transfer of value from the control of one entity to another. Achieving this is not a trivial task, and people are willing to, for example, pay money for armored vehicles, or pay western union to help them. This is an especially tricky problem when value is crossing from one legal jurisdiction to another, or in other countries where legal systems lower in quality or bribery-style corruption is a significant problem. The aggregate "in transit" value, plus any value tied up for convenience on either side of a transfer represents a fundamental floor for bitcoin's value.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:12:59
When you use your paper wallet generator (e.g.  you have the option to encrypt the private key. Then you print the encrypted version. An attacker would need to get a copy of the printout, and would need to guess your passphrase in order to steal your coins. This type of encryption is designed to be impractical to try multiple guesses because each guess takes a computer a long time to try.
Still, I would prefer to use a friend's printer, rather than a public printer like at Kinkos.

The definition of success is different for a miner vs. a holder on several points. Some examples: a miner wants difficulty to go down. A holder wants difficulty to go up. A miner wants to gain a larger fraction of the hashrate. A holder wants every miner to have the smallest fraction possible. A miner is focused on the next year. A holder might have a longer timeframe. A miner is subject to legal considerations that do not affect a holder etc.  
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:44:08
Just because an entity chooses the configuration of a node they distribute doesn't mean a sybil attack is happening.
Nor does selling the hardware along with the software make it any kind of attack. No one is forced to buy a Bitnode product. Bitnode is not taking it upon themselves to secretly deploy a fleet of them and thereby gain an inappropriate amount of power.
Nefarious activity could be detected and destroy their reputation, just as it would harm the reputation of anyone sneaking backdoors or unpopular policies into any node software. Furthermore, node hardware distributors have financial incentives that encourage rational behavior and the generation of ideas and conversation about the protocol.
All that said, yes, they should make the nodes open source and easily configurable. However, most users buying a node-in-a-box are probably going to just use the default configuration, meaning that the node provider is going to find themselves in a somewhat privileged position as a practical matter.

These guys do not get it at a very basic level. The idea behind Bitcoin is to build something that no one in particular controls, yet which performs well as a currency. It's less like engineering and more like taming a giant mathematical beast and finding out whether or not you can get the thing to work for you.
As soon as these dopes start working on a proprietary coin they have shirked the part that is new and difficult. There are plenty of mature solutions to manage data in a proprietary context. They can just fork Beenz and call it a day.
It's like when Bill Gates says that Bitcoin shows that low cost digital currency is viable, and then sneers at Bitcoin because MtGox collapsed. He cannot have it both ways. If MtGox shows that Bitcoin is a joke, then Bitcoin has failed to demonstrate the viability of low cost digital currency, and instead demonstrated the need for expensive centralized trust systems.
The fact is, though, that MtGox does not show that Bitcoin is a joke -- it shows that the technology and culture around securing digital currency is not mature yet. When it is mature, *then* Bitcoin will have demonstrated that low cost digital currency is viable, and by that point the issues that caused MtGox will have been successfully resolved, such that bringing it up will no longer be a legitimate criticism.

Google getblocktemplate. The idea is that we don't want pool operators to control what is in the block. Getblocktemplate is a way to allow the individual miner to decide what transactions go in the block. However most miners do not use it because it is not convenient. If you force them to run a full node, you get everyone 99% of the way to using getblocktemplate.
Another way to take power away from pool operators is to make pools impossible by giving the miner a way to steal the money. But pools provide an important function of letting little miners have a voice.

Actually, all of the mobile wallets could add this feature right now -- you check a box saying you want to use your home full node, then you input your IP address and violà.
Even better if Bitcoin Core display a QR code that would create an encrypted channel between your phone and the node.
This project will be a lot cheaper when pruning gets deployed, as you won't have to buy a spacious SD card.

On August 1st, miners will have a choice to make. They will understand that some users will now reject blocks that do not signal segwit. All users will accept blocks that *do* signal segwit. What is the best course of action for that miner? Will &gt; 50% of the miners take the risk that they are mining a doomed chain?
If a majority of the miners decide not to take that risk, then segwit will activate with &gt;50% of the hashpower, and no fork will occur. That is the scenario we are hoping for.
If a majority of the miners decide to *take* that risk, then a hard fork will occur, and there will be segwit coins and non-segwit coins. Which chain will be more valuable at that point? Note that the segwit chain will be the one with larger blocks at first -- at least until BU can figure out how to get Emergent Consensus to, uhh, emerge. The segwit chain will also be the one with segwit. You saw what that did to the price of litecoin. The segwit chain will also be the one with the majority of the users, potentially. So you tell me which chain will have a higher price.

Yes, I'm not suggesting that the transmitter is a paid service. The transmitter would be (illegally?) broadcasting their own transactions.

Shout out to Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchain.info, MIT, Stanford, Google, Microsoft and everyone. Would be super hep for you guys to set up APIs for requesting a signed copy of the last 20 block headers. Nodes could hit this for a second opinion and discourage this kind of attack. Also, bitsats and terrestrial redio sources could emit the latest block headers. I find it absurd to think that any node could get forked off while within 10 light-minutes of planet earth.

Quite right. I was abusing the language to refer to a universe where "free will" cannot cause anything which has not already been caused by physical laws and chance. (You could argue that chance and law are compatible, i.e. the  law says that an event has a certain probability, which is a "determinism" of a sort, and there are compatibilist conceptions of chance as an artifact of the observer's ignorance rather than of the universe. I am not a quantum physicist.)
I think free will can be usefully defined, but that it should be used with humility. And I disagree that we should  (or indeed that we mostly do) act as though we have complete freedom, whatever definition of that you have in mind.

Proof of Work is a reliable chain selection mechanism when there is no disagreement about what the validity rules are.
When there is disagreement about what chain is *valid*, Bitcoin uses the market to allocate hashrate to different subchains.

A typical node might request blocks from 8 peers, and serve blocks to 24 peers. How much money could be obtained this way is a matter to be decided by the market, but to the node operator it does not matter if the 24 "in" connections are SPV wallets, bootstrapping nodes, or ordinary nodes. In this over-simplified scenario, for every satoshi your node pays, you could expect 3 satoshis as reward.

If you only manage 1 key, then yes. However if you have more than one private key, making sure you have backups of them all can be more treacherous. You must carefully, manually track where every coin and change output went. Not so hard, but we are all able to make a dumb mistake. E.g did you realize there are compressed vs. uncompressed addresses, and it might matter?
Easier to let the software handle it, and have backups to cover the unlikely event of hardware failure.
Also easier to instruct your heirs in how to access a wallet.dat file, vs. how to use your personal manual system.

I don't think it's sidechains you would want to worry about, as these are pegged to the price of bitcoin. If bitcoin were inflating it would inflate the sidechain too. I'd be more worried about counterparty tokens, or some "stealth" token, the movements of which cannot be detected by looking at the blockchain unless you have extra information.
Personally I suspect Bitcoin could afford a low inflation rate -- something less than 1% -- without seeing people defect, and I hate that any technical decisions that could be helpful are off-the-table for ideological/political/emotional reasons. Bitcoin is expected to deflate due to lost/burnt coins so a little inflation might not even alter the real value of the coins you hold.
Small transaction fees should always be viable, simply because it is impossible to build a decentralized system without a spam penalty.
Other stabilizing forces that could potentially come into play are proof of stake + reputation hybrids (see Vitalik's POS with weak subjectivity, or Delegated Proof of Stake) or even legislation or taxpayer funded state mining operations if crypto really becomes they way earthlings conduct their affairs.

I went back and read  I agree that violating the 21M cap is politically impossible for the forseeable future, but I do not think that it is unfair to long-term savers. I'll grant that long term savers do not require a lot of new mining to protect their precious bitcoins from malicious mining attacks, because they are buried under so much proof of work. However, long-term savers absolutely need confidence in the network to be maintained, because this confidence is critical to maintain the value/price of the long-term stored bitcoin. That confidence depends on the ongoing mining effort, and long term savers can be justifiably asked to pay for that ongoing effort. In fact, they will be getting an unfair free ride on the backs of transaction-fee payers at some point in the future when the inflation rate gets low enough.
So the argument that inflation is unfair is not valid. It is quite the opposite. Lack of inflation is unfair.
The better argument to be making is that people might just opt out of paying the inflation charge by using a different currency that free-rides on the blockchain. Whether they would do that is hard to know, since bitcoins may be able to demand a small premium via inflation if they can offer better network effect and/or long term appreciation. Or if people just felt better about themselves by using bitcoin and not "cheating".
Another mechanism you could consider is a two-currency system like Seigniorage Shares or Bitshares/BitUSD in which perhaps you could charge a fee for the valuable service of providing a stable store of value -- and perhaps that fee could be passed onto the miners to aid with security.
Maybe -- and this is really a half baked idea -- but maybe the blockchain could actually *loan* money to people somehow, and could charge interest on the loan.

You do not need to force people to run code in order to break consensus.
Segwit2x is breaking consensus between the miners who provide the hash power, and the developers with a track record for safely improving Bitcoin, and a sizable chunk of Bitcoin users who argue that allowing attackers to create 8 megabyte blocks accepts excessive risk for little reward. That is true regardless of what software you personally choose to run, and is likely to produce a chain split.
Or alternatively I could respond this way:
"Forcing" someone to do something means that you take action to constrain opportunities such that they must either do it or face an unpleasant alternative.
In this case, segwit2x "forces" people to either run the new client, or continue on a chain with minority hashpower, which is an unpleasant alternative. In fact, some of the influential supporters of segwit2x have not been bashful about saying that they will use hashpower to attack and halt the chain of people who remain on the legacy chain.

We sadly live in a world where people can build their opinions on what are clearly unsound epistemological foundations, but then through a mixture of motivated perception and elaborately tricked out fantasies avoid ever getting shown where they are wrong. Bitcoin, by contrast, is so incredibly refreshing. Think the tech is going to succeed? Buy it! Sure the price will crash? Short it! Think you can get consensus behind your idea? Publish it! Think your code is better than Core? Run it!
And the time scales are to die for! Sometimes you only have to wait a few *weeks* to see the most confident pronouncements erupt like a pile of gasoline soaked laundry, and the panicked hucksters running in all directions and burping up excuses.

Lower. The. Cost. Of. Running. A. Full. Node.
I want easy-to-configure blackout times so the full node isn't talking to the network while I'm watching House of Cards. If a full node could just run while you are asleep, I think you would see more people doing it altruistically, and you might get good coverage as different timezones go to bed.
I want easy-to-configure upload caps. I want a continuum between a zero-impact node that just uses up 8 inbound peers and connects to 8 outbound peers all the way up to connect-to-everyone mode.
I want it to be easier to open port 8333 on my router.
Headers-first sync and pruning should help.
I want more/better wallets that use bitcoin core. Maybe an electrum wallet bolted onto a bitcoin core node for example.
There are a couple of simple things that can be done to make running a full node convenient and painless, and it will increase the number of altruistic nodes.
Altruism is currently the only incentive to forward transactions to the network, and altruism is a weak motivator, so you need to get the perceived cost down as close to zero as possible.
Ideal case would be a website where you click a button and it downloads a full node and sets it all up to turn on at night and attach to 16 outbound peers maximum, and it has a big nag screen that asks them to open port 8333 if it isn't open, and gives them access to tutorials to show them how.
Thanks for the gold Edit: Ok, when I get some time to sit down and figure it out, I'm writing a batch file to make windows schedule bitcoin core to do outbound at night and inbound-only during the day.

Yeah, I saw that. Not sure that I agree that the orphaning is 'gratuitous' because UASFs can only occur by threatening to orphan blocks that do not conform. If Greg doesn't want nodes to threaten to orphan non-compliant blocks, then Greg doesn't believe that UASFs are a legitimate way to modify Bitcoin.  Instead, he believes that (because of safety and liberty considerations) soft forks should always be lead by miners.
I said that UASFs can only occur by threatening to orphan blocks that do not conform. That statement requires some support because the truth of it is not obvious.
To see what I am talking about, consider the following scenario:
Greg proposes to use BIP-149 to soft-fork segwit. Let's put BIP-149 and BIP-148 on a level the playing field by assuming that Core decides not to deploy BIP-149, and users are left to adopt it on their own initiative.
The fateful flag day arrives, and 13.5% of the nodes activate BIP-149. Do we have segwit after the flag day?
Suppose I generate a segwit transaction after the flag day. I broadcast my anyone-can-spend transaction with the segregated witness and what happens next?
What happens next does not depend on the *users*, it depends on the *miners*. If over 50% of the miners are willing to treat my transaction as a segwit transaction, then a segwit block will be mined, and Bitcoin has segwit. If less than 50% of the miners are willing to mine my segwit transaction, then Bitcoin does not have segwit. So you can see that this is a Miner Activate Soft Fork (MASF) not a User Activated Soft fork (UASF).
Miners could choose to convert BIP-149 into a UASF, however, by mining a transaction that spends my anyone-can-spend transaction without including the witness. In this scenario, the 13.5% of the nodes that are BIP-149 would refuse to accept the chain with the most work, and that would introduce the orphaning that calls gratuitous.
So I am not inclined to call the orphaning gratuitous. Rather, I am inclined to call it a necessary feature in any UASF. Furthermore, I am not inclined to worry about trampling the liberty of the miners to refuse to mine the blocks that users want mined. Miners have the liberty to mine blocks that the economic majority decide are valid, or to mine on some other chain, and it tramples on liberty of the *users* for miners to act in such a way as to prevent the existence of the chain the users desire.

A couple of things to consider:
1. It would be nice if running a bitcoin node is very hard to regulate. For example, if a law is passed requiring a Money Transmitter license to run a node that broadcasts transactions, then would it be possible to run an unlicensed node and escape detection? When the bandwidth requirements get high enough you are going to stick out the way an illegal pot farmer sticks out by consuming a highly abnormal amount of electricity.
2. Although we have seen rapid increases in broadband speeds, I do not expect this trend to continue much longer. The bottleneck is the human nervous system here. Once broadband lets you stream 2 HD movies simultaneously, 24 hours a day, you have gotten to the limit of what normal residential internet consumers care about. We are basically there now, so I expect broadband speed growth to be reduced going forward. There is no profit to be made by spending money upgrading infrastructure to be more powerful than is humanly possible to consume.
3. The bandwidth requirements of a full node are a little deceptive. It is not, as Gavin has asserted, like downloading web pages. Full nodes operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and are unlike humans, who step away from their computer and quit downloading webpages to eat/sleep/live their lives.
4. Bootstrapping a node requires that you need some head-room on your bandwidth.
5. People won't want to run a node if it makes their video streaming experience crappy. So again you can't consume all of the capacity.
6. Nodes are not compensated, so realistically you are relying on altruism and the low cost of spare bandwidth. Those are relatively weak resources that cannot withstand a lot of pressure.
7. The block size constrains the growth of the ledger (UTXO set) which is very important and not talked about very much. [This article]( talks about why that matters.
8. If blocks get too large, it can make certain mining attacks worse, and reduce the hashrate required to pull them off. Larger blocks take a longer time to validate, increasing the disadvantage of miners with comparatively higher latency, or miners who did not mine the prior block.
I agree that we can support something greater than 1MB, but I think that it is wise to proceed in small steps. Segwit doubles capacity. Sounds good. Let's do it and see what the impact on centralization looks like. Making the blocksize bigger is easier than making it smaller. Adam Back's 2-4-8 concept seems fine to me, and by comparison, Gavin's "20MB RIGHT NOW!" approach in 2015 feels reckless.

I don't need that equivalence to notice that unless 50% of the miners agree to include segwit blocks, segwit activation will be meaningless. That is what makes BIP-149 a de-facto MASF rather than a UASF. Jihan Wu and Roger Ver still wield the veto pen.


That's a wrinkle in the analogy, but it gets less morally clean when you consider that other un-upgraded miners will be building on that chain and will get orphaned by the BIP-149 nodes, even though they did not do anything unethical.


I don't think that's the most important difference. I think the most important difference will be that BIP-149 is not going to be a soft fork led by the users, it is going to be a soft fork led by the Core devs. If most of the core devs had expressed support, or even bland acceptance of BIP-148, and had deployed it as an user-configurable option in Core, I think there would have been enough time to build the support you describe.
Instead, you have statements like [this one]( from Greg. That was 83 days ago, and if you look at the chart, that is exactly when the deployment of BIP-148 nodes suddenly flatlined. You have Pieter Wuille calling Luke Jr. insane for advocating BIP-148. (It was also rather uncharitable to hang Luke out to dry like that.) These devs have earned tremendous sway over the popular opinion.
So I think it is the negative response from core that has hamstrung BIP-148. The timetable was aggressive, but could have been met. After all, the soft fork is incredibly simple -- just add the demand for segwit signalling. Segwit was ready to rock and roll 8 months ago.

Right. But since a large fraction of the people who do not support UASF seem to do so because of things that will be true of all future UASFs, it is evidence that a UASF is unlikely to happen in Bitcoin. (E.g. But the *Miners* will not support the **User** Activated Soft fork! But the **User** Activated Soft Fork was not merged by Wladimir! We, the users, will have to wait until it isn't a user activated soft fork, before we will go along with the change.)

You will find many people arguing that whatever chain has the majority hashpower should be considered the valid chain by definition.
Technically you are correct. If the network rejects your chain, it doesn't matter how much hashpower you have. That said, if 85% of the hash power switches to Segwit2x, and they design it such that SPV clients do not detect the rules change and follow along, and they attack the legacy chain to reorg and disrupt it ... well as a practical matter they can cause a lot of chaos and put a lot of pressure on people to switch over.

I agree with some of them. For the people in your situation, Bitcoin is a superior payment system. However:
1. I think Bitcoin can be quite disruptive when used as a store of value. It has low inflation that is offset by adoption. It does not fund the government through seigniorage. It is difficult to confiscate, or even detect.
2. I don't think Bitcoin needs to be valuable as a commercial payment system in order to go up in value. The bulk of the market capitalization of bitcoin is going to be because of people storing value, not because of the bitcoin tied temporarily up during a purchase. It would go up in value just by being a settlement system.

Which proof of work do you think nullifies the advantages I just described, which Bitmain actually has?
Scrypt? Bitmain already makes scrypt ASICS.
Something that only runs on GPUs or CPUs? Bitmain can have boxes full of computers ready to go as soon as the new POW activates. After all, it will likely take weeks or months of public conversation to coordinate the change. They can probably buy used motherboards without cases, fans or power supplies and have them racked up for game day.

What 'entitles' you to something is if society correctly and impartially recognizes that it is, broadly speaking, in the best interest of society to make you having or keeping it a priority. At least, I think that is a rational anchor for moral realism. I think that the new coin would find that it was not respected if it went around confiscating coins like that, and would consequently fail to thrive.

If you are new, and you have an amount of coins that makes it worth the trouble to you, I would recommend using Electrum to store your coins.
You can get Electrum from the link on this page: 
When you can start up Electrum, be sure to make a paper backup by writing down the seed words the software shows you when it creates it's wallet. Keep these words secret.
Then withdraw your coins from Coinbase to one of the addresses your Electrum wallet generates.
It is important to do this process on a computer that does not have any malware. It can be hard to be certain that your computer is not infected with malware, so if we are talking about any substantial amount of money, boot up a clean operating system from a dedicated hard drive or Live DVD or Live USB stick.
The "Tails" Linux distribution comes pre-loaded with Electrum and can be booted from a USB drive.

I am not sure of anything.


I don't like evaluating decisions based on the outcome of the particular decision. Decisions should be evaluated based on the information accessible to the decision makers *at the time* and how that information should be acted upon in general, based on broad experience with similar problems. How things turn out in particular is interesting and worth study, but I try to be careful to be mindful that luck is a significant factor.


The 1 MB cap did not really start limiting anything until probably mid 2016. Segwit offers the best short-term relief option we have, and was deployed a few months later; it seems to me that Bitcoin Core was pretty on top of things, especially considering how hard it has been to get agreement on what should be done. Segwit is an impressively clever and powerful upgrade, and I wish the miners were willing to activate it.
For months, we have been subjected to these numerous transactions that are (most likely) created for no other purpose other than to drive up fees. That isn't a scaling problem, that is a DDOS vulnerability. Fortunately, the 1 MB block size limit Satoshi added as an anti-DDOS measure did it's job and caused fees to rise and increase the cost of the DDOS, rather than allow the UTXO set to explode. Unfortunately, a better way to deal with such attacks has not been invented yet.
A long term solution to the scaling problem that will result in tiny fees for a billion people making daily transactions on chain has not been invented yet for decentralized blockchains. Obviously you remove the block size limit, and onboard everyone, but Bitcoin would rapidly centralize and lose many of the properties that make it different from Paypal or VISA and cause people to want to use it, so you would have killed the golden goose. Also, it would become highly vulnerable to government pressure, making it very uncertain as a long-term store of value. The next financial crisis will result in governments complaining that crypto-currency constrains their power to "fix" the economy, and they will want to try to take control of the popular crypto-coins or at least ruin them as attractive alternatives to government-issued money.


Segwit is almost univerally accepted at this point, and being copied by altcoins. Early pushback was puzzling to me, and I mainly assume it was either incompetent people, or politically motivated.


For miner activated activation of an uncontroversial soft-fork, 95% threshold is fine as a first attempt. I do think that, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that it would have been better not to give miners veto-power over segwit. At the time, though, no one realized that Bitmain had a massive financial interest in stopping the segwit soft fork because it would disrupt their covert asic-boost advantage.


There has been a propaganda campaign, paid for by Roger Ver, and I would guess Bitmain too, to attempt to pry power away from the core devs. Most of the acrimony you are describing has resulted from that, although Theymos unfortunately gave them the superficial appearance the moral high ground with his dishonest censorship campaign back in the Bitcoinxt debate.


I sure hope so.

The witness discount is a good thing that causes price to better account for a real cost to the Bitcoin system (UTXO set growth.)

BIP-148 is fast, yes, but if it dies, the real nail in it's coffin will be that it was not deployed by Core.
It is true that people cannot vote, but what people *can* do is find ways to signal support strong enough to convince miners that it is in their best interest to mine the BIP-148 chain.
Perhaps your prediction will come true. If so, it is evidence that a UASF is unlikely to happen in Bitcoin. Only MASF or CASF (Core activated soft fork) are likely to succeed.

The POW just hashes the header. So you can tell by looking at the header how much it would cost to make on average. So it would cost like 8,000 to do 1 attack, and you would only fool the miners for the time it took them to receive and validate your block.
Miners could also have a rule like "ditch this block if it takes me too long to validate"

I'm guessing it's because small recovery codes are a nice thing that become possible when you are using a deterministic wallet, so they go together like peanut butter and jelly. This single feature is the deal breaker for me, as I prefer not to rely on digital media for long term storage and it's surprisingly time consuming to emboss a wallet.dat file on a steel plate.


First off, I apologize for singling you out. I hold you in very high esteem, and I brought you up mainly because you post a lot to reddit, which is where I get all of my bitcoin news, so I know your thoughts more than I know the thoughts of others.
Secondly, I did not intend to imply that you are at fault for anything, I just found it puzzling that you recently said that no one is asking for features to be added to the bitcoin wallet. Granting that what you say is true, I don't see how it is very relevant. People have voted with their feet, and the features that other wallets provide are no secret. The fact that they have not explicitly communicated their reasoning to the Core project hardly seems like a big problem to overcome. The bigger problem, as I see it, is that there is no money to be made by improving the Core wallet.


Electrum, Armory and Multibit come to mind first. If those implementations are in some way shoddy, insecure or otherwise unsuitable, then I suppose there is much more to this than I realized! They are time tested, widely used, and in the case of Armory widely regarded to be secure, but I admit those are not totally reliable proxies for suitability.

The attack is unlikely because it is expensive and because it doesn't provide an advantage to the attacker. Also, the attack doesn't harm the network more than, say, spam does.
In fact, this reduces the current problems inherent in headers-only mining because (almost) everyone would (almost) always have enough time to validate the normal blocks before they begin mining on them.

I disagree with this. Different bitcoins have different histories in terms of the transactions they pass through. These histories are trivially easy to investigate. As a practical matter, this leaves bitcoins vulnerable to schemes wherein some party feels legal pressure to avoid taking bitcoins that have passed through a particular transaction. These schemes have been proposed many times.
Ethereum just executed something similar. They didn't go find the DAO thief and demand that equivalent compensation be made. They followed the tokens by their history and miners essentially confiscated them. This would have been impossible with dollar bills. If the time limit for the withdrawal to ETC had elapsed, the Ethereum team could have issued a warning to everyone to not accept the ether because a hard fork was pending. This is not a perfect analogy, but you get the idea.
By contrast, if the Ether had been Dash or Monero, and had passed through multiple transactions, such that custody was impossible to determine (i.e. untraceable) then this action would have been infeasible. Starting to see the connection between unlinkability and fungability?
People are understandably anxious that coins they received at an exchange, or peer to peer, will be tainted and that they will fetch a lower price at exchange.

The way I define things:
~~A majority of miners refuse to mine (or build upon) blocks that violate the SF rules. Since indifferent miners follow the valid chain with the most work, and since they see the soft fork chain as valid, no split results.~~
Some fraction of miners refuse to mine (or build upon) blocks that violate the SF rules. If the majority of miners agree to this new rule, no split results, since the rest of the miners follow the valid chain with the most work, and since they see the soft fork chain as valid. If the majority of hashpower backs a chain that violates the soft fork rules, then a chain split results.
An economically significant fraction of Bitcoin purchasers loudly refuse to purchase bitcoins from a chain that violates the SF rules. Indifferent bitcoin purchasers and miners get off the fence because they don't want to mine or buy bitcoins that these other picky bitcoiners are boycotting. If the majority of miners allow themselves to be economically coerced onto this new chain, then no split results. If the majority of hashpower backs a chain that violates the soft fork rules, then a chain split results.
An economically significant fraction of Bitcoin purchasers refuse to purchase bitcoins from a chain that does not implement the HF. Indifferent bitcoin purchasers and miners get off the fence because they don't want to buy bitcoins that these other picky bitcoiners are boycotting. A chain split occurs unless 100% of the hashpower shifts over to the HF rules.
Some fraction of miners decide to start mining blocks that are invalid according to the current rules. The miners hope someone will buy the bitcoins in these blocks. A chain split occurs unless 100% of the hashpower shifts over to the HF rules.
Note that the difference between UASF and MASF is kind of subtle. The difference between UAHF and MAHF is even smaller, and in my opinion it's barely worth making the distinction, which comes down to who is taking the initiative. I think it's pretty clear that Bitmain is taking the lead on that, so I'd call it a MAHF, not a UAHF.

That's true, and irrelevant. My point was not to say that the dollar has all of these rules and therefore is less fungible. The reason I mentioned the laws and monitoring systems was to show that there is a precedent for the government implementing costly regulations to observe everyone's legitimate activity, looking for the bad needle in the haystack. Just look at the NSA if you want another example.


Yes, but being used in an illegal transaction can make dollars "frozen" which is what I am talking about


Philosophically, bitcoins and dollars are the same. The difference is not philosophical, and does not show up when considering bitcoins and dollars as abstract entities. The difference is technological and is in the nitty gritty. The technology does not exist to scan every dollar bill transferred at every grocery store, bar, coffee shop and theme park. The technology exists, however, to compare every single bitcoin against a government whitelist every single time. To be fungible, bitcoin needs to make that impossible, just like it is impossible with dollars. Otherwise, you may find that the bitcoins you purchased a minute ago were removed from the government whitelist 30 seconds ago, and now it is your responsibility to go to city hall to petition to get them reinstated so that you can go spend them at the grocery store.

I wrote a program in java to simulate performance of my "phased blockchain" proposal, originally posted here  to see what kind of improvement it offers with regard latency.
Assuming that the block interval is 10 minutes, and assuming that a miner requires 1 minute to receive and validate a block, you would expect the Bitcoin protocol to see a miner spending 10% of his time in a disadvantaged situation, having to choose between mining an unvalidated block or to continue to mining a block that may go stale.
In the phased block chain architecture with 2 phases, that number goes from 10% down to 2.5%. The basic mechanism is that while miners validate a block from one phase, they can simultaneously mine on the (already validated) other phase.
If you are worried about invalid block spam, a 2 phase approach might be an effective way to make spamming much less effective.

I'm glad you are agreeing with me, then.

One of Bitcoin's cool features is how difficult it is to maintain consensus, and how subtle the problem is. It works like a  bug zapper for incompetent people.

That with much bigger blocksizes, Bitcoin will centralize and be subjected to KYC regulations, and those hundreds of millions of people will never show up, because they will realize that Bitcoin is just a less convenient version of Paypal.
And actually, it would probably stop being anchored by Proof of Work, because once you need to apply for a license to be a miner, you can just use legal remedies against miners who permit double spends. So it would at that point be a waste of money to do Proof of Work.
E-gold doesn't have hundreds of millions of users. Is that because their technology could not scale? No -- it is because E-gold could be regulated.
Listen to me carefully, because it it important that you learn this lesson at some point in your life. Just because you want something to exist does not mean that it can exist.

To the contrary -- Bitcoin can have a TPS far far higher than Visa, because transactions can happen off chain, by many companies. It is not an exaggeration to say that Bitcoin could handle a million transactions per second without breaking a sweat. 
Or perhaps it would be better to say that Bitcoin is a currency, whereas Visa is a payment processor, and that therefore the comparison is a category mistake. Visa should be compared to Bitpay, not to Bitcoin.

Miners who did not find the sync flag first can receive it and validate it much quicker than they can receive and validate a block. So it's not the same. Rather, it is different in such a way as to achieve the benefits I listed. It's similar to receiving a block header and mining without validating, except that in the sync flag example, you would have already have had 2 minutes to validate.


Blocks would still come out every 10 minutes. It's just that no one would be hashing them for the first 2 (on average) of those 10 minutes. The difficulty target would automatically adjust to achieve this.
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:23:04
What I said was quite plain, but let's assume for a moment that you are not being deliberately obtuse.
If one customer at coinbase wants to send bitcoin to another customer of coinbase, then coinbase can make that happen without making an entry on the blockchain. This is not trading from one of my pockets to the other. This is analogous to what Visa does with dollars, except it is with bitcoins.
Most of the transactions are probably for their exchange platform, where coinbase is facilitating the exchange of bitcoins for dollars. This also bears no resemblance to the example you cited.
You do not need to use the blockchain to do every bitcoin (the currency) transaction. For many use cases, for many people, using a third party will get them everything they care about. That's the point here.
Maybe we will even do bitcoin transactions using the visa network someday, at which point saying that Visa has a higher TPS than bitcoin will seem even less relevant than it does now.

This is why I don't get when he talks about not knowing what deficiencies in core bother people. It doesn't take a brain giant to notice that something like 20 bitcoin core releases have come and gone since other wallets started offering 12 word seed functionality.
Yes, it involves nerve-wracking changes to wallet code, but it seems like the existing open source, time-tested implementations of the idea would not take very much time for Core to adopt.
So the problem is not that no one knows what features people want. Even something this obvious can't get implemented because there is so little willingness to pay for improvements to core.
Edit: I don't intend this as any criticism of the core devs by the way. They are focused on executing the "need to have" features to keep the system operational, rather than the "good to have" features that would persuade users to prefer the Core wallet. I just intend it as an observation, and puzzlement about why took the view that he did.

Thanks for your comment!


I wholeheartedly agree -- and this approach makes a significant change to the structure of the incentive system and has therefore inherent risk to consider.


Yes, I'm moving the current propagation/validation/orphan problem to a data structure that is specifically designed to be well-suited for it. The flags will transmit and validate far faster than blocks would.


Orphans are a function of latency, so if flags have lower latency, the orphan rate will be correspondingly less bad than it would be with blocks. It's a difference of degree, but the improvement would be worth obtaining.
Note that a 2 minute POW on the flag puts flags in the same zone as Litecoin (2.5 minute blocks) but for comparison, flags would be .004% as large as a litecoin block could be, and I would guess it could be validated one to ten thousand times faster.


Yes, I just grabbed a number that sounded fine to me. Feel free to think about what the goal function should be to compute the right number.
For example, you might say:
1. It needs to be large enough to provide enough time for everyone to get the previous block validated.
2. It should be as small as possible, because allocating hash power to the block is desirable, because you want to make invalid blocks as expensive as possible so that people are not tempted to spam miners with bogus blocks.


I don't see the problem here. Flag hashes are not wasted from the security perspective because the next block cannot be mined until the flag has been mined.

The key attribute that I think is important is to be able to backup your bitcoins by writing down a short string of characters on media of your choosing. Trusting a lot of money to a hard drive or flash drive is just not something I am going to do if I have another option. Currently I stamp a bunch of dice rolls on a metal plate as a seed, then append a password, an index and hash the result to get a new cold storage private key. Doing this makes me sad, but I trust this more than I trust electronic media.
I don't actually prefer Bip39 -- hex would be fine for my purposes, and I assume that RPC commands to dump and import the HD master private key will come along shortly to make me happy. 
However, this adds a new dimension to the discussion about why people don't use the core wallet. If people want to use a 12 word seed, and the reaction from core devs is "That's stupid, we aren't adding that"... well then I guess no one should get too surprised when people don't run Bitcoin Core.

I really like the setup where you run a full node, and then connect to it on your LAN with a second computer that runs your wallet software. That puts an additional layer between your wallet and the internet, and gives you full node security plus the option to use a wider range of wallets.

Well, there are no other software projects that I check in on every single day, and none that are remotely as exciting. So there's a data point.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:20:30
You cannot delay transmission of a flag for very long, because flags get mined quickly, and the variance (in absolute terms) is small compared to the variance of mining a block, and anyone else who mines one can propagate it so quickly that you can't win a propagation race if you are second off the starting line.
But if you cannot delay transmission of a flag for very long, then it cannot buy you much advantage, because the expected time to mine a block is so large compared with how long you can safely delay broadcasting the flag.
More serious would be the reverse -- hiding a block while you mine the next flag. If you mined a block quickly you could expect to mine the flag and then broadcast both. This scenario would have a result that looks just like bitcoin today. Everyone would receive the block and flag at the same time and need to start mining immediately.
However I'm not sure this situation is not still better than the status quo. After all, blocks would come out with an average time of 8 minutes not 10, and you have to pass through two Poisson events, so your chances to get lucky are reduced, and there is a big risk that someone will get a block, and then the global hashpower will beat you to the next flag, orphaning your block.
It would be fun to see a careful analysis comparing bitcoin with and without sync flags to see which has the greater selfish mining exposure. If long-short-long-short POW results in added selfish mining risk, making the flags and blocks have equal POW is an option to consider. I don't claim to know the best percentage.
@_date: 2016-07-30 17:52:36
How about a rule like: blocks must be signed by the private key of the coinbase of a different block (at the same height) which can be half difficulty? A single entity cannot mine these distinct blocks in parallel without splitting their hashpower, so they should broadcast to their competitors.

This is one of those statements that is true in a certain sense, but then used in a different sense from the one in which it is true.
I could similarly say "Unless you hold the physical cash, you do not have the dollars." It would be true in a roughly analogous way. And for 99.999% of the time or more, having the electronic equivalent of dollars would provide the same benefit, such that to say "I don't have the dollars because they are electronic" would be a pretty pointless thing to say.
This is an example of using a hyper-simplified verbal representation of a complex topic to encourage people to come to incorrect conclusions. As a practical matter, the differences between physical cash and electronic cash do not mean that stock trading must proceed at the speed of a briefcase exchanging hands. And as a practical matter, it is my intuition that the slow rate at which the blockchain can be written to will not get in the way of millions of people using bitcoin every day.

I love the name of this protocol -- it refers to the two phases of the mechanism -- a "stem" that carries your transaction through multiple random peers, followed by a "fluff" that represents a random peer broadcasting your transaction.
Bitcoin sorely needs this upgrade to privacy. Currently if you broadcast a spend of a large address you are putting on a sign that says "LOTS OF BITCOINS ARE LOCATED AT THIS IP ADDRESS!" I don't know how difficult it is to pin down which node originated a given transaction, but it seems quite likely that attackers with multiple listening nodes could do it.
To protect your privacy, you could run your node over tor, but it does not add value to burden tor with your full node bandwidth. All you really care about is hiding *your* traffic. Maybe this dandelion protocol is even superior to tor? After all, the "fluff" phase would really frustrate traffic analysis. I have heard that the government has a lot of tor nodes and uses them to learn a lot about tor users.

How do you calculate that number? Why that number, instead of 4 MB, or 20 MB? Is this just a "gut feel" type of thing? We have to demand better than gut feel.
At 1 MB blocks, a full node consumes more bandwidth than 98% of homes in the United States, or so I am told. Approximately 1 TB per month. We are already at the top of the range of what would be considered 'typical' internet usage, yet somehow multiplying that by 10 is going to be fine? Asserting it is not good enough. Stating that you believe it isn't good enough. You have to make a persuasive argument, filled with inferences with a track record of high reliability, in order to be taken seriously. Otherwise, the best approach is to carefully increase the block size incrementally and observe what happens. Doubling it, as segwit does, seems like the sensible next step.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:04:16


I am strongly against a chain split, but what if Bitmain is making bank off of ASIC-Boost and takes the position that if we activate segwit they will split the chain? Critical protocol upgrades just halt until Bitmain goes out of business? Which won't happen any time soon because they are making huge profits with asic-boost? Profits that they are plowing back into propaganda campaigns and buying praise from technical leaders?
At some point I have to think that submitting to Bitmain's influence is doing more damage than a fork would do.

The shame of is is that when you are picking a wallet, it is nice to use one that has the most eyes on it. Network effect provides a security benefit, and no one wants to be the first person to try out Joe Whats-his-face's feature packed wallet.
For this reason, there is a lot of value to be gained in having the Core wallet be very solid, and if it isn't feature rich, it should at least have all of the necessary primitives (ahem Bip32) and a great API, such that most of the feature-rich wallets use it as the (massively reviewed and tested) engine behind the scenes.

What do you think about the following "Pacing block" idea?
After every normal bitcoin block, a "pacing block" must be mined. This is a miniature block that can be sent in a single UDP packet. The difficulty of this pacing block is sufficient to give everyone a chance to receive and validate the previous normal block. Each normal block has the hash of the previous pacing block.
Edit: pacing blocks could be funded by taxing blocks suitably far (e.g. 10 blocks) in the future.
Tax rate could be 10-20% of block reward. An advantage of this is to make transaction stuffing by miners either obvious or costly.
Also, they would reduce the variance of winning a block.
This could be done with a soft fork.

UASF will only work if enough miners join to prevent such an attack from succeeding.
We need enough users to announce that they prefer the BIP-148 chain, so that people are reluctant to purchase non-BIP-148 bitcoins, because of the risk that other people will not want to buy them, collapsing the price on that chain.
Likewise miners should prefer to mine the BIP148 chain, under the belief that those are the coins that other people will prefer.


UASF meets your criteria. There is a not-insignificant chance of success. If it fails to catch on, I predict the BIP-148 chain will rapidly become irrelevant.
There are several ways the changes to Bitcoin could be caused:
1. Developer led
2. Miner led
3. User led
Is 'User led' viable? We will find out. I think it's better for Bitcoin if the answer is yes.

I defended social contract concept because that was the concept under attack, and I think it is a useful model for describing the dynamics of the situation and the things that should be condemned by society.
If someone other than the government accomplishes a goal better and cheaper, then the government should not have a monopoly over it. The goal here is not for government to do things, it is for a group of human beings to arrive at a set of rules that promotes the common welfare, and to use persuasion, condemnation, and the threat of punishment to promote conformity to the rules.
If the government does in fact have a monopoly that it should not have, you are welcome to try to change the government in various ways, however if you simply choose to break the law, and you get caught, you will receive condemnation and punishment. That's how things work. Civil disobedience can be a tool in your bag to effect change, but typically people do not view tax evasion as praiseworthy civil disobedience.
I fail to see how advocates of a "free society" are going to achieve their goals without using the social contract tool. If they are content to just whine on the internet, then of course they do not have to get their hands dirty. But if you want to actually run a civilization, unfortunately you have to put some people in jail. And not just people who volunteer to go to jail.

They can make changes, but only if they have the cooperation of the vast majority of the miners. Even non-miners could theoretically wield a veto if enough cooperated by running full nodes. If enough nodes refuse to relay blocks that they don't like, then the blocks will not spread through the network.

To make the best I can of your statement -- yes I would agree that violence should not be used against people who may be upgrading the ethics of society. However, there are obvious exceptions. For example, Islamic extremists who think they are upgrading the ethics of society should be fought, with violence if necessary. I would disagree with any kind of highly anarchic system. I don't think they produce very good societies (yes I know many of the people here believe that they would, despite the lack of solid reasoning leading to such a conclusion) and I think that there are time-tested games, like representative democracy, that offer helpful structure to our group coordinating efforts.

I plan to copy my node's hard drive shortly before Aug 1, so I can fall back to the legacy node if UASF fails.


Recently it has gotten much harder for me to see what everyone plans to do. Are most miners planning to deploy BIP141 prior to Aug 1st to prevent a fork due to UASF? Or does the whole segwit2mb thing involve trying to turn on segwit in some other way?
Also, LOL at people trying and failing to ram protocol changes through without adequate planning and coordination.
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:44:57


Calling BIP-148 a contentious soft fork technically true, but misleading. The "feature" BIP-148 turns on is only to demand that miners signal segwit. You want segwit. You want miners to signal segwit. You want everything that BIP-148 demands. You just don't want to demand it. As a user, it's your decision to make, but I think you should demand it, and I think Bitcoin will is a more robust protocol if this experiment works, because it demonstrates in a persuasive way that users can lead a change, even though it is such a tiny change. You don't need git repo keys, or an ASIC manufacturing company to make a change happen, if it is compelling enough to build a large enough coalition.

Not trying to hide. "Social Contract" is my term for the technology that groups of people employ in order to coordinate their behavior to make more efficient use of resources so that everyone on average does better than if social contract were not used. Under social contract a critical mass of people agree to a set of rules, and agree to punish people who violate the rules. Each individual may disagree with some or all of the rules, but all individuals will endure condemnation and punishment if they break them. Human society cannot function without this technology, and I consider it an obligation to set up a well structured set of laws and to obey them.

If the UASF people do not represent an economically important fraction of bitcoin, then UASF will fail, and *should* fail. If, however, the UASF people can be argued to represent the will of the users of Bitcoin, then UASF should succeed and probably will.
If you think that all protocol upgrades should be gated by the miners and/or the core developers, then go ahead and try to persuade people of that. I don't share your opinion. BIP-148 activates a feature that the vast majority of users either want or find acceptable -- albeit perhaps in a way they think unnecessarily risky.
Also, I don't agree that SegWit2x is a big threat. It is very very difficult -- or perhaps impossible -- to achieve a contentious hard fork of Bitcoin.

Talking about "stamps" for anything other than postage is archaic in the USA -- it would probably only occur to someone who lived through WWII rationing. "Stamps" is somehow appropriate, since it's another sort of alternative currency. Stamps is also a funny because stamps are usually issued by an authority to buy a certain thing, and the authorities would never issue stamps to buy illegal things. Also funny because calling them blow stamps subtly mocks the common perception that bitcoin is primarily for buying drugs.

The way UASF theoretically works, is that non-generating nodes credibly assert that they will reject non-conforming blocks. Miners *follow* their lead and produce conforming blocks.
That is what makes it a UASF. If we are waiting for hash power to signal, then that is a MASF, not a UASF.
Now you may argue that UASF cannot work, and to be convincing you will need to provide reliable reasons why you are correct. Personally, I think it would be good if Bitcoin could achieve protocol changes in other ways than via MASF. I think UASF can work. I think if Users of the currency lead, miners may succumb to the pressure to follow. I think it's good for decentralization if that is true, and I think it's worth the try.

Proper terminology is "public address" not "public key." Public address is a hash of the public key and it's what you send coins to.

Yes, it is great to solo-mine, but I think we should encourage people to run a full node too.
It is my understanding that if the number of fully validating nodes does not keep up with adoption, it could cause problems with the network. The core network **consists** of full nodes so it makes no sense to say you are doing "essentially nothing" for the network by running a full node.

Yes, they absolutely could tamper with transactions in that way, however the question I was answering was "isn't it the same as a few big banks holding all the money?" and the answer to that question, in my opinion, is no, and the reason the answer is no is because their actions would be detected by every node around the world in about 5 seconds, and would have immediate adverse consequences. It is totally unlike the manipulations that they are able to carry out on regular money. The corrupt blockchain they just created would potentially become worthless within hours as the crypto-world reacted.

False. A miner runs for the cost of the hardware in that situation. If you tried to mine with a CPU, for example, you would never recover your investment because the hardware is not efficient enough. The more money you can invest up-front, the more efficient hardware you can purchase. If this problem gets worse, then it will mean that if you do not have a lot of capital at the beginning, you cannot do anything but lose money by mining.

Well, I must admit my conversation with throwaway-o has done a great deal to shake me up, but here is my thinking at the moment:
Naturally I have no objection with Jews in Germany resisting the Holocaust, which should not surprise you since you are responding to a comment where I said that the North Koreans should overthrow their government.
The whole idea of a "social contract" as I see it comes from the need to deal with the freerider/cheater problem in society. It is bad to be alone. It is better to be in society and reap the benefits and pay the costs. But it is best of all, for the individual, to be in society and reap the benefits, and not pay the costs. Members of the group realize that widespread cheating of this sort will result in a breakdown of the functioning of the group, so they all mutually agree to punish/coerce each other if one is found to cheat. This phenomena is just the technology human societies use to solve the freerider problem, and this is what I call the social contract.
I am not defining social contract as "everybody has to do what the guys with the guns say to do" as your question seems to assume. Indeed, if the appointed executors of the "punishment" part of the social contract get out of control and are corrupt, then it is good to replace them or repair the institutions that guide or incentivize their behavior.

This does not hurt bitcoin, because it does not make other potential investors lose confidence in Bitcoin, because investors in Bitcoin did not lose money. Investors in expensive mining rigs lost money, and they will be discouraged from spending a lot on specialized mining equipment in the future, which is what we want to have happen.
Let me repeat -- expensive, highly optimized mining rigs are bad for Bitcoin. Cheap, general purpose machines in the hands of millions of people is good for Bitcoin. People who invest in sophisticated mining equipment are damaging the decentralized model, because they make mining unprofitable for people using cheap hardware. The Bitcoin protocol should discourage capital intensive mining techniques if it wants to continue to be a decentralized currency.
You can change the rules in the middle of the game, certainly, and you should do it if you expect it to get the effect you want.
As for whether it is free-market or leftist, I don't think anyone should care. I want Bitcoin to be successful, and I will only evaluate ideas based on the effects they will have, not based on prejudices about whether somethings seems "leftist" and gives me an irrational icky feeling.

False. The critical thing that non-generating nodes *enforcing* UASF offer is the credible threat that their owners will refuse payment in Bitcoins that do not conform to BIP-148. It is this threat that (when the moment of decision arrives) applies the pressure that makes miners reluctant to mine non-conforming blocks.

Various implementations of the state deserve every ounce of criticism leveled at them. Even the most well-structured states have grievous problems that may never be addressed. Although the issue is not black and white, I think that the state is a worthwhile institution and an amazing achievement.
By the way, a lot of people in this thread have insisted that the social contract is a fiction and have essentially asked "where did I sign up for this?" To this I would point out that "private property" has the same epistemic status as "social contract" and indeed the existence of private property is just an aspect of the social contract, just like taxation is.
To me, if a person says "I did not sign the social contract, therefore I am not under obligation to pay taxes" that is similar to them saying "I never signed a paper saying that that car belongs to you. So I will drive away with it." Taxes and private property are behavioral technologies that a group of people collectively bind themselves to obey, or be punished, because the people recognize that it is a necessary concession in order to have a society that functions to help them all get the things they care about.
Again, this can breakdown due to corruption, and the state may need to be re-structured, but I don't think that the solution is to abandon the idea of a social contract.

Now that BIP148 has been coded and released, people have the opportunity to deploy it, and by doing so they send an honest signal about how serious they are. It shows that they:
1. Are still paying attention
2. Still care enough to look away from watching TV for long enough to upgrade their software
3. Have the technical ability to obtain and deploy the upgraded node
It is simply the case that if people upgrade to an enforcing client, that is stronger evidence that they will, in addition to *promising* to upgrade, *actually perform the upgrade.* We need all of the certainty we can get, and people should take positive action to make it crystal clear that they are willing and able to run this software on August 1st. In fact, if they are hospitalized between now and then, their computers will automatically carry out their intentions.

Changing the system from within is good. Spreading ideas of voluntary exchange and universal moral and ethical principles is good. There are lots of tools that will help us get there -- even civil disobedience. But do not expect to break the law and be told "it's ok, you did it for a good reason you don't have to be punished."
The reason I am not walking around punching people and extorting people is that I have good desires, partly due to biology and partly due to the culture I was raised in. Most people are good people. Some people are bad people and will murder, rape, extort and punch, so naturally we need laws to deal with it when they do those things.
We also need laws governing the use of water, and the preparation of food, and other things. Not because I am a bad person, but just because we all tend to take short-cuts and care more about our-selves and our families than we care about strangers. Also, without those laws in place, I will not be able to be competitive in the market unless I take short-cuts, and I will soon find myself out of business.

To make the economic calculation, you need to think of a mining rig as just another way to purchase bitcoins. A miner is a box that spits out bitcoins until the difficulty gets too high.
If the miner costs more bitcoins than you expect it to spit out, then you are better off not buying it.
So you have to make a prediction of how the difficulty will change over time, and then calculate whether or not you should buy a miner.

The target is adjusted so that every 10 minutes another block is added to the blockchain. If more people mine, it gets harder so that they don't solve it too fast. If fewer people start mining, the target gets easier so that it always take 10 minutes on average.
By they way, it isn't getting more complex exactly.. it's more like this:
When the difficulty is high, it's like saying "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to a million. Guess what it is." When the difficulty is low, it's like saying "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to a hundred. Guess what it is."
The reason Satoshi set the block time to 10 minutes has to do with trying to make sure when a block is found, the whole internet learns about it before someone else finds a different solution to the same block.

Run this thought experiment. If no one desired gold, what would it mean to say that gold had value? Imagine it for a minute. You didn't want gold for anything. None of your friends wanted gold for anything. Having gold would not make you rich because you could offer it to people and they would not care. That's what it means to say that value is subjective. It depends on the subjects, that is to say, it depends on us.
On the other hand, gold has certain properties which make people value it. It is durable, for example, as well as many other properties. These properties belong to the gold, and you can bet your ass that in the future, people will value those properties. Because of what people are, and how people relate to each other, and because of what gold is. So in that sense, the value is objective. Edit* (Because people are predictable objects in the gold-person system.)
I think you are better off throwing away the subjective/objective dichotomy and just thinking in terms of properties of the world as a system of interacting things.

Not a fair comparison. People own silicon fabs TODAY. They would not have to purchase a new silicon fab just to destroy Bitcoin. They would just use some of the capacity on a silicon fab that they already own to do this. Or a government (E.g. China) simply orders an existing silicon fab to carry out this job. Also, any crypto-currency in widespread use is going to have a market cap of &gt; 100 Billion USD. Maybe a trillion. Even if you had to build a dedicated fab from scratch just to destroy bitcoin, which as I pointed out, you would not need to do this, it would probably cost less than 2 billion USD. Finally, the act of destroying Bitcoin would not destroy your silicon fab, however, it would destroy your stake. So, again, a totally unfair comparison.

That's your call, but keep in mind that we are currently experiencing a technology transition from FPGAs to widespread ASIC deployment. At some point, the curve will get less steep. If you jump in at the right moment, you will buy a miner cheaply, when everyone thinks it will not be very profitable, and then the difficulty increase will decelerate, and you will get more bitcoins out of it than anyone expected. Then the window will close, as the price tag of the miners shoots up because the difficulty is not increasing so fast.

Whether a transaction is mined or not is not the best measure of the permanence of a transaction. A transaction can be considered reasonably permanent as soon as it is broadcast to the network. If you want more assurance, you may want to wait for an hour worth of network hashing to provide that assurance. One hour of hashing is about 6 bitcoin confirmations, or about 24 litecoin confirmations. In other words, litecoin didn't improve anything by speeding up confirmation times.
Edit: Furthermore, in a point-of-sale context, waiting 2.5 minutes for your transaction to be confirmed is unacceptable, just like waiting 10 minutes is.

"I don't see bitcoins as an alternative to gold. It is not a modern day gold standard. If anything they're modern day alchemists, but you can't make gold digitally.

"People use cash too" is a clever retort and debate stopper to the objection about Bitcoin and buying illegal things, but I think it trivializes the concern people have. The fact is, Bitcoin has different properties than any other medium of exchange. When comparing it to cash, you have to acknowledge that Bitcoin makes it possible to exchange with people who are not nearby. Cash doesn't enable this. Bitcoin allows you to transact with people you never see, and don't trust. Cash makes this more difficult.
The real argument to be made, is that we should use Bitcoin despite the fact that it enables criminal activity, because it is so valuable to society. The internet enables criminal activity too, but the benefits outweigh the costs.

I'm sure that Proof of Stake will not serve on its own, and am inclined to think that a combined POW/POS approach is best, however I'm open to the idea that POS doesn't actually achieve anything worthwhile above POW.
What I want the people who are deciding the direction of Bitcoin to prove, is that they will be financially harmed if Bitcoin is harmed. Also, I want a linear response between the "resources controlled" and the "influence obtained", rather than the non-linear "money spent on mining hardware" vs. "influence obtained" we have now which favors centralization so much. I wish I knew the ins and outs of a POS protocol that would reliably achieve that.

As the block reward goes down, the system is supported by transaction fees. The amount of money spent mining will tend to  exactly equal the amount voluntarily paid in transaction fees. It would be irrational for people to pay so much in transaction fees that Bitcoin is un-competitive relative to their other (centralized) options. Therefore, Bitcoin will always be economically competitive with the other options. It is a self-stabilizing feedback loop.

Thanks for responding.
The question was whether the programmers can destroy bitcoin, not if they can release an update that is bad for Bitcoin. I think my answer is correct, although I did not elaborate enough.
Gavin cannot destroy Bitcoin because he does not control enough hashing power.
Everything is open source. If Gavin releases a bad update, word will quickly get out. Miners will not update their software with Gavin's update. The majority of the hashing power will mine on the pre-update protocol. Gavin does not control enough hashing power to overpower all of these other people who do not want to see Bitcoin die, so he cannot produce a high enough proof of work to get blocks containing his bad update added to the blockchain.
The only way Gavin could crash Bitcoin with an update is if he was so clever and subtle that his update was an undetectable poison-pill that would damage Bitcoin so badly that it could not be patched up. I think it's unlikely that Gavin or anyone else could craft such an update.

In step 12 of my tutorial, I suggest that you experiment on bitaddress.org by inputting a passphrase into the brainwallet tab and verifying that the private key that it creates is identical to one that a different paper wallet generator creates. You could use brainwallet.org, safepaperwallet.com, bitcoinpaperwallet.com.
If you try 10 different passphrases, and input them into multiple brainwallet generators, and they all yield the same 10 private keys, then you have good reason to believe that the brain-wallet translator is honest.
Since you are generating the passphrase via a die roll, and since the translation from passphrase to private key is honest, then everything has been verified.

If you're super hardcore about physical durability, you could look into encoding a seed for generating a series of paper wallets as a pattern of drilled holes in a metal plate. A 16x16 grid gives you 256 bits of entropy, assuming the distribution of drilled vertices is random. To convert this into a series of private keys you can just input the pattern as a brainwallet passphrase like this:
Private key 1 has brainwallet passphrase = "010100...101000-1"
Private key 2 has brainwallet passphrase = "010100...101000-2"
You could even add an easy to memorize password like this:
Private key 1 has brainwallet passphrase = "010100...101000-Lemons-1"
To get your random binary sequence you can roll a die 256 times and convert each 1-3 to a "0" and each 4-6 to a "1". (Could also flip a coin, but coins don't have exactly equal probability of landing heads or tails, and remember you're hardcore.)

The miner decides how much the miner is paid. Sort of. If they pay themselves anything other than 25 bitcoins, then the block they mined will be rejected by everyone else on the network!

It is proof of mining, it is just set to a lower difficulty.
Even though the difficulty required to send a transaction could be low, if enough people mine at the low difficulty, then sometimes they will produce a hash that qualifies at the higher difficulty, and they will actually mine a block. If the transaction difficulty is set to .1% of the block difficulty, then I think that approximately every 1000 transactions, a block would get mined by chance. The other 999 transactions would not mine a block, but would qualify at the low difficulty and therefore would successfully broadcast a transaction.

2. It was not possible to maintain sufficient competition in mining. Maybe economic dynamics force centralization. Maybe a state decides to out mine everyone. Maybe no way is found to make transaction fees high enough to pay for an adequate quantity of mining.

Obviously hard drive is tough, but when pruning comes that will help, or maybe people could be a partial node of some kind that does not require every block. For simplicity, maybe there could be a "high resource" mode, and a "low resource" mode, and a "custom resource" mode. The low resource mode could just do the minimum required to "break even" and not be a drag on the network, or maybe break even plus support two leeches or something.
2. Security. Some people will not be a full node if they feel that it increases their risk of being attacked through port 8333.
3. Stability, as in your previous post. No crashing please!
4. Deterministic wallet. It's a pain to have to remember to backup your wallet.
5. Confusion. If people do not have incoming connections enabled, that needs to be obvious, so that people do not think they are running a full node when they are not.

The "bill" that cannot be broken is not the address balance. It is the individual contributions used to fund the address. 
For example if one of the inputs to the address were .5005 I believe it could be spent cleanly without touching the other inputs and there would be no change.
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:44:42
The ability to spend bitcoins from an address is controlled using a very long random number called a "Private Key". A wallet is whatever you are using to store your private keys.
The private key is used as an input to a cryptographic function that proves that you own the bitcoins and can therefore spend them.

Yeah, Bitcoin-Qt doesn't handle this in a way that makes much sense to me either. The problem is that if you send the change from a transaction back to the originating address, it makes it easier to track your spending just by looking at the blockchain. So Bitcoin-Qt creates a new address from scratch every time you get change back from a transaction. I have no idea why they chose to make all of that invisible to the user. It isn't a problem if you only ever use Bitcoin-Qt, but as soon as you try to manually transfer your private keys to some other wallet, you end up getting confused.

It is not all about percentage of the hashrate. It is percentage of the hashrate minus your expenses. If you expect to spend $2000 on mining hardware, but only expect to capture $1000 in hashrate percentage because $2000 cannot purchase sufficiently efficient machinery, then you will not invest.
My approach would make it less profitable to spend a lot of money purchasing super-efficient hardware machinery, which is a pre-requisite for decentralization. That way you can buy your $2000 machine and start earning some bitcoins. Ideally everyone with a computer could profitably mine.
The mining reward pie is a certain size. If it is possible for individual actors to make a lot of money by mining, then there will be no reward left to support the broad decentralized base that we want.
You have successfully argued that I am devaluing mining hardware. You have not provided an argument for how this would affect the price of a Bitcoin.

To the degree that mining cost-effectively replaces existing heating methods, it is free. If it is free to do, and yet it gives you money, then more people are going to want a piece of the action. The scale of the mining operation therefore increases until we run out of need for heat. At that point, people just put miners out on their porch, until the difficulty gets so high that they are uselessly heating their porches to the tune of $3.6M.
In reality, not all needed heat would be provided by ASICs because the $3.6M would be burned on the difference in cost of manufacturing between traditional heating machines and manufacturing ASICS. ASIC heating will get cheap, no doubt, but probably not as cheap as simply burning natural gas.

Looks good to me, although it may be tricky to store an Ubuntu startup image and bitaddress on the same jump drive. I've never tried that.
This is fine for small quantities of Bitcoin, but for large quantities, consider my tutorial:
In particular, your method trusts the pseudorandom number generator in your computer to output unpredictable values, and you are trusting that your copy if bitaddress.org is not corrupt. Those are probably reasonable things to trust, but it is not necessary to trust them, and it is not a lot of extra work to use a dice-generated brainwallet passphrase.

BTC is probably still too volatile to make it the national unit of account, but it could become the national payment network easily enough. There could be some sort of sliding "official exchange rate" between the Krona and BTC, and the government could hold BTC reserves and heat their buildings by mining BTC with their famed geothermal energy. You could pay your taxes using BTC, and they would save money on printing bank notes and by having a more efficient accounting system.

Bitcoin has a track record of erupting into a giant bubble, then falling down to a point above where the bubble launched from. It has done this several times already. What would motivate me to believe that it will not do it this time? I expect it could drop as low as 200 before rebounding to maybe 400 and camping out there for a few months. That would be more in line with what has happened before.

If you run a "light" client like Electrum or Multibit, it does not download a copy of the blockchain to your computer. You are relying on other people to store the blockchain and verify that it is constructed properly.
If you have the storage (currently ~12 gigs) and the bandwidth (not sure how much, but not much) and your computer is turned on most of the time, it is nice to run a "full node" such as Bitcoin QT or Armory. This will store a copy of the blockchain on your computer, and do analysis on it to ensure that the blocks are all correct. Other computers will connect to your computer and request blocks from you, and your computer will send them the information. Your computer will re-broadcast transactions as they are entered into the system.
This way, your computer will be a full participant in the bitcoin network, and will help make transactions propagate quickly around the world. You will also make it harder for someone to execute an attack on the network that would slow down traffic.

Furthermore, when the burden of taxation becomes unreasonably heavy, and the connection to the will of the people is severed, then I think it is reasonable for the people to subvert the government by various means.

I didn't say that the state had a claim on the fruits of your labor without your consent. I'm not making any statements here about what the state has claim to or whether taxation is good or bad.
All I am saying is that "private property" is a concept invented by society to solve various problems. The society you live in makes up the rules governing what constitutes "earning" ownership over a particular valuable thing. The society you live in makes up the rules governing how much you owe in taxes. There is no such thing as private property without society.
Insofar as the "state" is the vehicle that society uses to manage the regulation of private property, private property is whatever the state says it is. If the state tells me that I can go build a house on an acre of land and live there for 5 years, and I will have "earned" that acre, then that's the way it is. If the state tells me that if I go build a house on an acre of land and live there for 5 years, then I have not earned it but merely have been trespassing for 5 years, then that's the way it is. It would be ridiculous for me to assert that "I lived in Yosemite valley for 5 years, so now I own Yosemite valley" unless I was referencing a homesteading law that backed me up.
If you own a house, you have a deed to the house.  The state makes the deed. If you don't have the deed, then you don't own the house. It doesn't matter if you labored for it for 10 years or 40 years. If you didn't get the deed, you don't own it. That's not right or wrong. That's just a description of how private property works on this planet.
Most of the wealth that people have isn't earned by labor anyway. It's wealth that flows to them by virtue of the private property (capital) they possess, according to the laws the state enacts.
I'm sorry that reality makes you want to vomit by the way. Where did you think "private property" came from anyway? Jesus?

There are conditions that cause people to hoard, certainly, but I think that the experience of the United States, in the 20th century, as a data point, strongly suggests that the ability to get a rate of return on saved money will not in and of itself cause economically problematic hoarding.

On the intrinsic value thing, not to beat a dead horse, but Peter and others are equivocating between two different meanings of "intrinsic value."
1. They are referring to value that gold has other than monetary value. E.g. people value gold for other things than as a means of exchange. This point is invalid. Bitcoin proves that things do not require some other value prior to becoming a means of exchange.
2. They are referring to the fact that because gold has chemical properties that make it the obvious choice as a physical means of exchange, people can be counted upon to come back to gold again and again. This point has some merit -- if people ever switched to a different coin, or blockchain, Bitcoin's value would likely drop to zero and never come back.
It's confusing when they say "intrinsic value", especially because it causes everyone to immediately jump down the rathole about intrinsic vs. subjective. I believe that the above two points are the real features they are motivated by, and I would suggest that if you debate Peter, you say basically:
1. A thing does not need value as something other than a means of exchange in order to be successful as a means of exchange.
2. You have a valid point that Bitcoin could theoretically go to zero, whereas gold cannot. I propose that the world will consolidate around *some* crypto-currency, and that network effects will provide the stability that chemistry imparts to gold, and I argue that it will be Bitcoin.

This is not motivated out of any desire on my part to mine blocks or compete with the ASICs, or would it move me toward that goal at all.
What I want is for the mining to be as de-centralized as possible. This method is no good if it doesn't add blocks to the blockchain, and it is no good if it adds a trivial number of blocks to the blockchain.
The proof of work would be valid for a block, because it would have all the transactions to be included, and the previous block. If the person doing the transaction is not running a full node, they could ask the network to send them the current block info to add a nonce to, and trust that they get an accurate answer.
Precomputation cannot produce a block, of course, so you would always execute the POW on the current block candidate. If you solved a block you would want to immediately broadcast it and collect your reward. However, if you failed to solve the block but managed to solve to the transaction difficulty, then you could store evidence of that and use it later to send a transaction with, so you can still pre-mine transactions.

The reason I encourage people to understand change addresses is because some people have accidentally lost money by not understanding it. The problem happens like this:
1. They have money in a paper wallet.
2. They import the paper wallet to Bitcoin-QT and spend some, but not all, of the money from the paper wallet. Bitcoin-QT sends the change to a change address that Bitcoin-QT creates, instead of sending the change to the paper wallet address.
3. The user doesn't understand how change works. They think that they spent PART of what was in the paper wallet, and that the remainder is still there.
4. The user loses access to their wallet.dat file, because they do not realize how important it is. Maybe they forgot the password, for instance.
5. The user tries to import their paper wallet again to get the rest of their money, but there is no money in the paper wallet. The money was in the wallet.dat that they lost access to.

Don't get too hung up on terminology. Suppose we call it inflation. Fine. The facts do not change.

That means that if you are storing bitcoin under your mattress, it "inflates" in value at the time of the inflationary event, and its purchasing power is not altered. This is completely unlike the kind of inflation that everyone is familiar with, where the cash under your mattress decreases in purchasing power -- and that is the point worth caring about.

Actually, depending on the difficulty setting, blocks would still be found. For example, even if you set the difficulty to 1/100 of the difficulty required to mine a block, people would "accidentally" mine honest blocks from time to time.

I think feathercoin endured a 51% attack where they just swallowed hard and accepted the corrupt blocks rather than hard fork. Hard forking is a huge, huge deal that could cause the price of Bitcoin to collapse.
It isn't just the miners who would be forced to choose whether to mine on the corrupt fork or the honest fork. Everyone who is buying bitcoins would have to decide which fork to buy them on. The exchanges would reprice both blockchains according to whichever one people believed was going to survive. The price on one of the blockchains (hopefully the corrupt one) might quickly fall to zero.

First, I think everyone should keep an open mind about what is likely or unlikely, since this is all very new. Second, although it is the miners who would be dropping out, it might be better to think of it as the users of the currency not paying enough in transaction fees to support enough mining. Miners dropping out is kind of an effect, not a primary cause. I don't know how or why this would happen, but it seems safely within the realm of possibility to me.


I agree that re-mining would not necessarily solve the problem, however it is a pot of "unclaimed" money that could be considered to help contribute toward solving the problem.


"destroy" is a pretty strong word here. It would certainly reduce the advantage that Bitcoin has over other currencies, but if no other means can be devised to pay for enough security, then it will be safe to say that no other currency will out-compete Bitcoin on the inflation dimension. Anyway, the alternative in this hypothetical scenario would be an insecure network, which would make Bitcoin more unattractive than inflation would.


Judgments like this, as with the max block size, are made via forks. On a related note, the quantity of transaction fees per 10 minutes is probably related in some way to the max block size. There is probably a sweet-spot as far as the block size that brings in the most transaction fees. How is max block size determined? A coalition forms to promote a fork, and then the fork is executed if enough people believe it can be successful, and then hopefully a large majority choose to mine on the same side so that the currency is not damaged.


I don't know. This is all pretty hypothetical. I can imagine a scenario where transaction fees, plus re-mining old coins, provides enough of a margin of safety as far as hashing power goes that it doesn't require frequent re-adjustment.


I sense that we are starting to disagree about the meanings of words, so I won't argue about "stability" or "upset" mean. However, I will add one thing -- that the market is still presumably in adjustment over the coins lost in the previous 10 minutes, and that if you prefer, you can think of the re-mined coins in the block as compensating for the coins freshly lost since the last block. You don't have to pair them with the loss that the market digested 50 years ago.

Ok. Well, the protocol specifies that you should pick the chain that statistically speaking would have taken the most work to produce.

Some people have suggested that coins from notorious heists should be declined by merchants and exchanges. This is problematic from several perspectives.

Here's my strategy so far. As early as possible in the game, while they are probably the cheapest, buy as much as you can take a total loss on without your life being ruined. Then as it goes up, sell off some to recover some of the original investment. The trick here is to be patient and wait until it goes high enough, and sell a small enough percentage, that you will not feel bad for taking some money off the train. If you feel bad about it, you buy back in higher, and then of course the universe notices, and BTC crashes again. You need to wait until it is high enough that you are fine with taking your profit and never buying back in. You should have done your buying EARLY while it was low. If it drops below your sell point, bully for you -- go ahead and buy it back.
I would not risk selling my whole stash like this, because as it goes up and up I would get twitchy and want back on.
Edit: I mean, what do you do if it goes to 400 and then crashes to 210? Or does like it did in March/April and goes to 1000, and drops to 300?

Try thinking of it this way. The government is just like the blockchain. It's a way for everyone to arrive at consensus about who owns what.
Now you can say "I don't care what the government says. I own this thing here." That's perfectly possible for you to do, and there is a direct analogy to the blockchain.
Imagine if you fired up your own mining hardware and create your own fork of the blockchain. In your own fork, you could give yourself big mining rewards. You could even consider yourself an ultimate authority, and you could declare that your own blockchain is the authoritative one.
The problem with your blockchain is that it does not represent the consensus of everybody else. Everybody besides you is using some other blockchain.
It's the same way with the government. You can complain that the government has no right to determine who owns what, just like you can complain that the blockchain has no right to determine who owns what. The fact is, though, that the government is the tool that everyone else is using to determine who owns what. And that is why if you get caught not paying your taxes you will go to jail, and the rest of the world will not consider it an injustice.

Heard about it during the 2011 run-up. Was going to check it out but heard that it crashed. Heard about it again shortly after the fork in March and thought, "Wow, if that didn't kill it, that's amazing." 
Bought some at $45. Continued reading and buying on the way up to the April crash. Sold some before the crash, and held enough to be priced $70 on average. Bought all the way down bringing average price up to $97. Went through the nauseating drop in June. Tried playing the market during those months and did worse than if I had just held. 
Right now the average buy-in for me was at about $110. I have more invested than I am comfortable with, but I feel like a rally is imminent. Planning on holding until $275 and then selling about 30% to bring my exposure down. After that I let it ride. If it drops down to $250 and there is no terrible news I consider re-buying in. If it never drops to $250 I'm just grateful to have played.
That's the plan anyway.

Transaction fees are small today, and storage requirements are small today, however in the future the volume of transactions could be 100,000 times greater. If the demand for transactions skyrockets, the cost of storing the data will go up, the bandwidth costs will go up, and the price of each transaction will also go up.
I'm not saying these issues would be of sufficient magnitude to overcome the network effect. I'm just trying to describe the issues that I see as most relevant.

@_date: 2013-10-10 19:13:10
This is the key insight. "Bitcoin" is not the store of value any more than "HTTP" is a store of value. The particular blockchain that Satoshi started is where the value is stored. The Bitcoin protocol could become modified beyond recognition in the future and it would still store the same value, so long as it was still adding to the same blockchain. 
Try to use a different blockchain, and you will find the catch-22 that no one values it, because no one values it.

Just imagine a hypothetical world, where if I decide not to spend a dollar today, it will magically grow in value, and it will give me more spending power tomorrow. In such a world, we can suppose, no one would ever spend any dollars! You'd have to be crazy to spend this magical money!
Oh, wait, we already live in that world! If you save your money you can get a rate of return on it -- but.. what's this?? People aren't saving jack shit anyway? It's almost as if they:
1. Are not rational
2. Over-discount the future
3. Prefer instant gratification to saving their money
So... no. As long as this planet is primarily populated by human beings, I am not worried about deflationary currency being hoarded.
Let's not forget -- money is for spending. You can't take it with you when you die. So how long do you want to save your deflationary money? You want to wait until you are at least 85 years old before you finally splurge on good beer and a necklace for your wife?

Right. Think of it this way. Here is what mining is:
1) Scooping up all the requested transactions from the network
2) Throwing away all of the invalid transactions
3) Using a lot of computer horsepower to calculate a special number that makes the block valid. This is so that only one valid block is produced every 10 minutes.
Miners would not do those things unless they were paid to do it. To pay them the protocol arranges things so that if they are the first to calculate the special number (called a nonce) they are awarded 25 bitcoins, and also the transaction fees from all of the transactions they processed. Essentially, by mining they are entering a lottery, and they hope to get lucky and produce enough blocks to pay for their equipment and electricity.

I'm glad you're pushing Proof of Stake!
ASICS are creating a highly non-linear relationship between economic resources expended and influence obtained, and this is the root problem.
I think that we probably cannot do any better than linear. That means that no matter how much economic resource I have already mobilized, the price of additional influence remains the same for me as it does for everyone else.
It seems to me that Proof of Stake has the most potential to realize this linear relationship.
People who are whining that POS gives the rich people too much influence have it backward.
In the current scheme, the rich people are in a position where they can purchase additional influence more cheaply than poor people can. Under a well-implemented POS system, people could only obtain more influence proportional to the additional bitcoin they purchase. This is exactly the linear relationship that is so much better than what we currently have.
This is the point that should be emphasized. Under POW, the rich can purchase influence more cheaply than the poor can. Under Proof of Stake, that inequality can be dramatically reduced.

Most hot wallets permit you to import a private key. This gives the hot wallet the power to spend the coins. When you spend them, some will go to the destination, some will likely go to a "change address" in the hot wallet, and some may still reside in your paper wallet.
Alternatively, many hot wallets let you "sweep" a private key. This will cause the hot wallet to transfer the whole balance of the paper wallet to one of the addresses in the hot wallet.
I suggest that you do not throw away your paper wallet private keys even after you have spent from them. If you decide to throw them away, though, be sure to verify that the address is empty first.

I don't know how Mycelium works, but I can tell you a little bit about how a transaction works. You cannot spend *some* of the money in a bitcoin address. You have to spend all of it simultaneously. So what you do is, in a single transaction you send part of the money to an address, and send the *rest* of the money to the "change address." It is perfectly fine to make the change address be the original address that the money came out of, although the default mode of the QT client is to send the "change" to a new address.

While agree that theft and murder are very clear cut, private property is much less obvious. For example, is it appropriate for a corporation to "own" a particular idea, and prevent other people from expressing that idea or building products from that idea? Some people say yes, some people say no, and it is a big source of contention.
Is it appropriate for a person to "own" a plot of land and tell other people to get off? Certain aboriginal groups would like to have a word with you. You could even conceive of the United States government as a corporation that owns the territory that it defends, and allows people to access if they assent to the contract implicit in citizenship or visa.
Is it ok for coal companies, who purchased mining rights for a tiny amount of money long ago, to extract resources in perpetuity and even get a tax write-off on "their" coal as it disappears?

Adding the technique I am describing to your paper wallet has nothing to do with the weakness you are describing.

Yes, this is precisely the idiotic interpretation I sadly expected. This makes any economically viable usage of bitcoin illegal in Norway.
If they want to say it isn't a currency, that it is an electronic payment system, then it should be taxed in a way that is analogous to the way electronic payment systems are taxed -- that is to say, on the fee.
This interpretation would be like if I said that if I paid for a pizza with a visa card, I am buying the full price of the pizza in "visabucks", and I should be taxed on that, and then I should also be taxed on the pizza. Everyone would immediately stop using credit cards.
It basically doubles the VAT on everything, which is not an assumption that goes into computing the proper level of VAT that people pay.
With petrol you are taxed two times. You pay income tax, and then you pay VAT when you purchase the petrol.
With money you are taxed two times. You pay income tax, and then you pay VAT when you buy the pizza.
With Bitcoin you are taxed **three** times. You pay income tax, and then you pay VAT when you buy the bitcoin, and then you pay VAT when you buy the pizza.
That is why Bitcoin is like money and not like petrol. It is because you do not pay VAT to burn petrol. You do pay VAT to burn (spend) bitcoin.
If you want to charge VAT on bitcoin, then make purchase with bitcoin VAT exempt. That's a law I could gladly accept.

Here's an idea I think is really slick:
1. Create a paper wallet
2. Store some small amount of BTC on it. This is your decoy.
3. The private key is the brain-wallet passphrase to your real wallet.
4. You could even add an easy to remember password to the end of the passphrase. For example, if the private key to your paper wallet were "5KAh26G8JbE7QffhDCsZh4TGwWmPwTkhkwyS3fzRfQxo6XetnpK" then you would use the following as your brain-wallet passphrase: "5KAh26G8JbE7QffhDCsZh4TGwWmPwTkhkwyS3fzRfQxo6XetnpK_Password123"
Now, the thief steals your paper wallet, and maybe gets the decoy money. They never think to also get the secret money, and you can swear that there is no more money!

Building error correction math into WIF sounds great to me!
I'll tell you my approach to redundancy, and you may laugh, but it's completely true.
When I send coins to a paper wallet, I want the chances that the private key is wrong to be zero, otherwise I'll feel anxious about it, so here is what I do:
1. I don't use a printer or QR codes. I hand copy the WIF format. I have a special printed grid that I fill out that has three rows and one column for each character. Characters such as "5" or "F" or "b" take up the top two rows. Characters such as "a" or "w" take up just the middle row. Characters such as "q" or "p" take up the bottom two rows. That way there is absolute clarity about which character I am printing.
2.  After writing out the WIF longhand, I type it back into my offline computer on the "wallet details" tab. I verify that it created the same public address as before.
3.  I write out the HEX version of the private key longhand, in groups of four characters. Again, I use a special template, but since the only characters are 0-F the template is only one row high.
4. I write out the HEX version of the private key longhand again. This time I do not do it on a special template. I do it in a blank section of the paper. Again in groups of four characters. I try not to take my eyes off of the computer screen as I do this, so my handwriting is not the most perfect for this step.
5. I compare the HEX string from step 3 to the one from step 4, one 4 character block at a time.
By the time I am done, the page has three complete copies of the private key, in two different formats. The HEX format in particular is hard to corrupt, since there are only 16 possible characters, all of which look very distinct.
Finally, as I mentioned elsewhere, there is a "seed" key that I can theoretically use to reconstruct any private key if it is physically damaged.

[Zerocoin]( is an experimental protocol which allows you to deposit a coin in a sort of public bulk storage, and then later prove that you deposited a coin, without revealing which coin you deposited.
Because of this "blind proof" you can withdraw a coin from the storage and there is no connection whatsoever between the coin you put in and the coin you took out. So it acts as a gap in the chain of custody of a coin, like a mixing service does.
Unfortunately the blind transactions take up a lot of bytes, so it isn't practical to add it to Bitcoin, however it would make a great alt coin for ducking in and out of.

You earn 25 BTC for solving the block, no matter how many transactions it has. This miner missed out on transaction fees from unconfirmed transactions.
Edit: Some people have said that small blocks propagate through the network faster than larger blocks (i.e. blocks with more transactions in them.) If this is the case, then a miner may decide to ignore all of the transactions in favor of a lower probability of being beaten by another block that propagated faster. This problem should diminish over time as transaction fee totals get higher, block rewards get lower, and block generation times get closer to 10 minutes.

I don't really understand the risks well enough to quantify them for you, however I would encourage you to try creating a bootable CD with a copy of Ubuntu linux on it. This is easy to do, even if you do not consider yourself good with computers. It is a very widespread recommendation because it reduces the chances that you have a "keylogger" running on your computer, recording what you do.
If you do not have a printer that you can plug into your secure computer, then I would suggest you either buy a printer, or copy the private key and address by hand. If you copy it by hand, you need to check your work very carefully to make sure you copied it correctly!!
I do not know what printer you plan on using that is not at home, but I would not recommend going to a retail printing service place, or printing on an office printer that may have a hard drive.

Good point. Personally, I split it up into multiple brainwallets so that in the extremely unlikely event that there is a screw-up (Malware spends the money while I'm trying to redeem it, something was wrong with the public address generator, or something bad that I haven't though of happens) I don't lose everything. You mentioned that you are terrified to touch them because you might make a mistake -- so I figured breaking it down into many smaller piles would lessen your anxiety.
Totally reasonable to prefer to keep everything in a single paper wallet.

Agreed. So there are multiple approaches that can be used to solve the problem of limited resources. A very good one is to focus on making production of electricity sustainable, and propagating the full cost to the end consumer. If people are still using electricity doing things that are not worthwhile, and if the price of electricity is judged to be too high as a result, society could consider shaming them or making certain uses illegal, as it does with watering your lawn during a drought, or taxing certain uses to tilt the usage toward more favored uses. I don't mean to be dogmatic about my original suggestion.
If there are more cost effective means to accomplish what Bitcoin does, then they are preferable naturally. I think that if energy is produced in a sustainable way, and end users are made to pay the costs, then that will create a market signal that will force Bitcoin to use energy wisely, or be replaced by a lower-cost alternative crypto-currency.

You can recover your private key from the dice roll, as it is essentially a brainwallet passphrase. The answer to the change address question will vary depending on how you spend the coins from the paper address. When the time comes to spend, I recommend that you import to a client (electrum, BitcoinQT, multibit, armory) and then immediately send most of the coins to a fresh paper wallet, leaving behind only a small amount in the client.
Finally, NEVER destroy a paper wallet private key without verifying via blockchain.info that the address has a zero balance.

I think the way it works is like this:
A transaction consists of a list of input amounts and a list of output amounts. The inputs have to sum up to at least as much as the outputs. (If they sum up to more, that becomes the miner's fee.) So in a relatively simple transaction, you can have a single input, and two outputs. One output is the payment, the other output is the change, and it goes back to another address controlled by the sender. (Or back to the same address that the payment was sent from but that is not the default way wallets work for privacy reasons.)

What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2013-10-29 14:00:10
**The "Change address" problem:**
You should understand change addresses because some people have accidentally lost money by not understanding it. 
Imagine your paper wallet is a 10 dollar bill. You use it to buy a candy bar. To do this you give the cashier the entire 10 dollar bill. They keep 1 dollar and give you 9 dollars back as change.
With Bitcoin, you have to explicitly say that you want 9 dollars back, and you have to provide an address where it should go to. If you just hand over the 10 dollar bill, and don't say you want 9 dollars back, then the miner who processes the transaction gives 1 dollar to the store and keeps the remainder themselves.
Wallet software like Bitcoin-QT handles this automatically for you. They automatically make "change addresses" and they automatically construct transactions that make the change go to the change address.
There are two ways I know of that the change problem can bite you:
1. You generate a raw transaction by hand, and screw up. If you are generating a transaction "by hand" with a raw transaction editor, you need to **be extra careful** that your outputs add up to the same number as your inputs. Otherwise, the very lucky miner who puts your transaction in a block will keep the difference.
2. You import a paper wallet into a wallet software and spend part of it, and then think that the change is in the paper wallet. The change is not in the paper wallet. It is in a change address that the wallet software generated. That means that if you lose your wallet.dat file you will lose all the change. The paper wallet is empty.

4) Less vulnerable to 51% attack

6) Miners could purchase the right to mine via POS, and be protected from more powerful miners in this fashion
7) Contributes to network security by ensuring that the most powerful agents are the ones with the most to lose if Bitcoin goes down the tubes

Yes, that accomplishes the same benefit.


As I am sure you know, the block rewards will be cut in half every four years until the network is supported only by transaction fees. Some people believe that the economics of transaction fees will not support enough mining to secure the blockchain. If for some reason this happens, total network hash power could be increased by taking off the 21 million coin cap and re-instituting inflation via block reward, or by re-mining coins. Some people would find re-mining a more attractive option in that scenario, as it is limited to using money that people have lost or intentionally destroyed, whereas inflation has no obvious limit. Or that property could also make inflation the more attractive option, if that is the only way to get the hashing power high enough.


This is a straw-man you are arguing against. The coins do not have to all be re-mined simultaneously. They can be re-mined according to whatever re-mining protocol is judged to be appropriate. For example, they could be re-mined at a maximum rate of 1 BTC per block.


No. If they are all declared dead, the money supply goes down over time. If they are re-mined, the money supply stays approximately constant over time. I'm not asserting that is an advantage, however it is more stable.

I don't think that capitalism vs communism is a particularly useful lens to view the problem through. The goal is to maximize the number of un-correlated control points so that we maintain the competitive architecture that makes Bitcoin reliable. The problem is that some control points are able to wield far more influence than others. The improvement involves changing the protocol so that it is more difficult to acquire a large percentage of the power. If Scrypt will help with that, then I propose a modified client be distributed which would accept blocks that are submitted using a Scrypt POW, and would load balance between Scrypt and SHA-2. If enough people who run full nodes think that is a good idea, then a hard fork will occur and off we go. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who run full nodes who would like to use their Litecoin rigs to mine Bitcoins, who would participate in the proposal.

There is one of these kiosks at my workplace. It maintains a balance of my money, and I can scan my snack and then use my barcodecard/pin or fingerprint to complete the purchase. If my balance is not enough, it asks for cash or credit. It cannot give change. It has a screen that displays instructions. Could very easily display a QR address on that.
The greatest thing about this is that it stores my remaining balance in an account on the machine itself, which makes buying stuff extremely quick, and completely overcomes the "wait for confirmation" problem.
This seems like a great use case. If the machine held the value as BTC, and looked up the exchange rate whenever it did a purchase, you could conceivably put in 20 bucks worth and then purchase snacks for the *rest of your life* without putting in any more BTC! 8-)

That's right. It pays to pay attention closely here. Some folks have uploaded a paper wallet into Bitcoin QT, and then spent some, and then thought that the remainder was on their paper wallet. It wasn't! It was on a newly generated change address. This meant that they thought they had a physical backup, when really the only copy of the private key to the address was in their wallet.dat file. Some have lost coins this way. Others have created so-called offline transactions involving their paper wallets, where they sent part of the money to a destination address and didn't specify any change address. The change in this case just got turned into a "tip" for the miner who found the block. The original owner of the money was in for quite a shock when they checked the balance on their paper wallet and found it to be zero.

Well I certainly agree with you that you could kill people and not get caught, and that you could evade paying your taxes and not get caught.
I just think it is useful to think about those things as violations of an implicit agreement with society, and that if you get caught violating the agreement, society will respond by doing what a gang of humans has evolved to do best -- crushing you into pulp like the competition for resources that you are.
I do not argue for society in its current form. I think that society can be dramatically improved to provide more happiness and a better connection to the desires of the masses.
I doubt it can be improved by tax evasion however, and I think it is best if people pay their taxes and get punished if they cheat.

The key here is that when you purchase the alt-coin, you do not care whether any merchants will accept it or not. The alt-coin does not need to be spendable, it just needs to be convertible back to bitcoin. It is much more difficult to put legal pressure on small-fry exchangers than it is to put legal pressure on merchants. And a distributed architecture for exchanging CRYPTO currency does not present the technical challenges that have plagued the invention of distributed BTC/fiat exchanges. Therefore you have some expectation of finding a person who will give you clean bitcoins for your tumbled alt coin. I like it!
Edit: In fact, the alt-coin could be zerocoin!

Let's look at the simplified model.
There are only three people in the world: John, Sally and Sue. Sue has a house. Sally has 155 BTC. John has nothing, but wants a house.
Sue agrees to give John a house, but it will cost 100 BTC. John asks Sally for money. Sally gives John 100 BTC, but asks for 110 BTC in return. John gives Sue 100 BTC. Sue gives John the house. Now John needs to mine some more coins, right? Wrong! John is knee surgeon, and Sue has a bad knee! John repairs Sue's knee, and charges her 55 BTC. Now Sally's knee has gone bad! John repairs Sally's knee and charges her 55 BTC. Now John has 110 BTC, which he gives to Sally!

This is great! A lot of Native American groups run casinos. Maybe this could be leveraged somehow to bring BTC into the community, or to create a demand for BTC somehow. For example, certain games could require BTC, or BTC transfer could be a safe, cheap way for high rollers to import their money to the game. Or they could offer to give you your payout as BTC.
They could also run BTC/USD exchanges and possibly circumvent some state licensing and bond requirements. That would really play to their strengths as sovereign (semi-sovereign?) territories.

Once you spend from a paper wallet, the private key touches a networked computer and is much less secure. You should send coins you want kept secure to a new paper wallet. This is the best way IMHO if you are spending infrequently. 
Two other options:
1. Use Armory to sign transactions on an offline computer, and transfer the signed transaction to a hot computer via usb stick. 
2. Use a transaction editor to sign transactions on a cold computer. Use this method if you want to lose all your money by making a typo!

There is no counter-party risk when you are using Bitcoin as a store of value.
If you follow good procedure, there is no risk of physical damage, since you can keep multiple copies of a private key in multiple locations. (Unlike, say real-estate which could be damaged by fire or flood.)
I mentioned taxes in the context of the store of value. You do not pay taxes on stored Bitcoin value, unlike with real-estate. Of course you are supposed to pay taxes on the appreciation.
No maintenance or security costs. You can store $100,000,000 of bitcoin on a sheet of paper. This compares favorably with securing more than two tons of gold or an apartment complex.
Liquidity depends on the situation. I can purchase a laptop using Bitcoin with one click. You can go to your jewelry store which is apparently 2 minutes from your house (WTF?) and get cash, and then go drive to an electronics store and buy the laptop. I think Bitcoin wins in that scenario. If you are cashing out $25,000 you will probably have to wait a few days for a wire to go through but I somehow doubt the jewlery store would hand you a wad of cash that thick.
So tell me how I'm ignoring reality?

The "blockchain" like a big book that everyone keeps a copy of. This book has every bitcoin transaction that has ever happened, in order. A new page is added about every 10 minutes. If you add a page to the book, you are allowed to put a special transaction on the page that says "create 25 bitcoins and give them to me." So everyone would like to add a page to the book.
Mining is when you try to add a page to the book. You start your page with a description of the previous page. This is so that you can't cheat and start working on the page before the previous page is finished. Then, you listen to the bitcoin network for transactions. These have fees that you get to keep. You write down these transactions on your page. You add your special transaction awarding you 25 bitcoins. Then you have to guess a certain number, called a "nonce" that you write down on the page. If you guess the correct nonce, then your page will be accepted by everyone as the right one to add to the book. It takes a lot of work to guess the right nonce. That's why it's called a "proof of work".
The difficulty of guessing the correct nonce is set high enough so that even though thousands of people are hunting for it, it will take about 10 minutes to get it by guess and check. Once someone somewhere guesses the nonce, they publish their page, with the nonce on it, and everyone adds it to their books, and the race to make the next page begins.
Technically speaking, you need to guess a number that, when you add it to the block, causes the hash of the block to be below a certain number.
The number of guesses you can make per second is your "hashrate", and the higher your hashrate the more likely it is that you will be the first one to create a valid page.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:43:33
That's where my analogy breaks down. Proof of Work systems cannot become more "efficient" because if they do, the difficulty just goes up so that the blocks continue to take 10 minutes. In equilibrium, the burned energy and manufacturing costs will exactly equal the value of the minted coins plus transaction fees.
It is conceivable that a proof of work algorithm could be designed that would simultaneously do other functions. Folding/SETI don't qualify because they don't have the right mathematical properties. (i.e. hard to do but easy to verify). Primecoin at least advertises that it does something useful, however most folks around here are not impressed by what it does.
The Proof of Stake community argue that sufficient security can be achieved without using Proof of Work, or with less Proof of Work, but that has become a holy war, and the Bitcoin core devs argue that Proof of Stake cannot provide the security it claims to be able to. I can't decide who's right. Peercoin advertises itself as an eco-friendly coin.

In competitive situations like this the natural trend is toward centralization. Big players can mobilize more resources, and they can mobilize them more efficiently. Big accumulations of power form and persist, while smaller accumulations of power die out or merge into bigger ones.
ASICs are not the cause of this -- they are a manifestation of this. Look at how political power concentrates into parties and you will see the same dynamics at work. Another example is with brands. Typically as a market matures, two brands will come to dominate the market, and the other vendors will fight over the scraps. This just shakes out of the mathematics that govern this type of system, and Bitcoin will be successful if it can function in an environment where mining power is organized into a small number of large, powerful pools.
I think it will succeed, because everyone realizes that, as robust as Bitcoin is, it has a catastrophic vulnerability. If any single actor can control the network, then people will not trust the network any more, and the value of a bitcoin will fall. Because of this, the people who run these pools do not want to control the whole network. They want to control as large a part of the network as possible, until they flirt with the perception that Bitcoin is centralizing. They can make additional money by selling the hardware to people who are not affiliated with the pool.

Or I can buy a $300 piece of mining hardware that will do a poor job of warming my bathroom, and will earn a grand total of 85 cents over 6 years of continuous use, because the difficulty has gone sky high by capital-flushed miners running exa-hashes on their brand-new helium-cooled 9nm chips.

I don't think you can do that in WIF (Wallet Import Format, the one that starts with a 5) because it may have a checksum somewhere. If you want to do that you can try modifying the private key in HEX format. I put your private key in the wallet details tab of bitaddress and got it in HEX format here:
You can replace any characters in this with 0-F and it will still be a valid private key. This is also the format that you can use if you are using 64 rolls of a 16 sided die for your private key.
(Again, you're going to have to trust software to convert the HEX to a public address, so you still need to validate the translation software.)

I don't know the answer, but I think it's important to think about it in those terms. When you buy a miner, you are buying a quantity of bitcoins, payed over time. If you could buy a greater quantity of bitcoins on the market today, then that is a better option.
I haven't dabbled in it, but from what I read here, you have to get pretty lucky to profit from mining. (Or have connections to the manufacturer.)

What you are proposing is extremely unlikely. These brain wallet converters just take a phrase and run SHA256 to convert them to a 256 bit number. We have good reason to think that SHA256 is secure, and if it isn't, then bitcoin is screwed anyway.
Why would bitaddress deviate from SHA256 in making the private key? Maybe through a mistake, or through a sneaky plan to get your bitcoins. But if it is a mistake, it is highly unlikely that the other brainwallet software is going to make the same error. So comparing will reveal the mistake.
That leaves malice. But if it is a sneaky plan to steal your bitcoins, then it must generate a different key than SHA256 would. In this case, the difference would show up in the comparison against other brainwallet converters again, unless all of the brainwallet converters decided to use the exact same sneaky key generation algorithm. But if they were all using the same sneaky key generation algorithm, then surely someone would have noticed by now.
Bitaddress generates the same private key from a passphrase that linux does when you run SHA256 from the command line. Are you going to suggest that linux has been corrupted with a hacked SHA256 algorithm for the purpose of stealing bitcoins? And no one has noticed yet?
It is imaginable that bitaddress could use SHA256 99 times out of a hundred, and on the hundredth time it steals your coins. I think this sort of attack would be blatantly obvious in the source code, but I run every paper wallet I create through two different generators just because I am what I would consider obsessively paranoid about this.

How about this: Use a vanity generator to make an address with a nice beginning. Send a small amount of BTC to the address. Then you use the [firstbits]( of the address as your personal seal. You make sure to include this sequence of characters everywhere. For example, I could make my reddit user name "moral_agent_1moral2x". (That's an example firstbits. I don't actually have the private key to that address.)

Roughly speaking, entropy is a measure of how many passwords an attacker will need to try before they have a 100% chance of finding your password. For example, if a password is known to be the result of a single six sided die, then the attacker would need to check 6 possibilities before they would have a 100% chance of discovering your password. Electrum uses a passphrase that has 128 bits of entropy. This means that an attacker would need to check 2^128 passphrases before they had a 100% chance of discovering your passphrase. Put another way, there are 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible passphrases. You achieve a similar result by rolling a 6 sided die 50 times and using the digits as your passphrase. (And then you don't have to trust Electrum, or your computer's random number generator.)
BIP38 is a standard way of encrypting the private key so that a password is required to recover it. This means that even if an attacker finds your paper wallet, they cannot learn the private key without the password. BIP38 uses an encryption algorithm called Scrypt which is hard to brute force because it take a long time to try each password. Because of this, it is safe to use a short, easy-to-memorize password.
Bitaddress does not support using dice AND BIP38 encryption. If you use dice, you cannot have your wallet encrypted. If you want encryption, you must trust the random number generator on your computer and your copy of bitaddress. It would be nice if they would add the ability to encrypt on the brainwallet tab!
Personally, I do not encrypt. The paper wallets are stored in a secure location, and I want my family to be able to access them without any hassle if I die unexpectedly.
@_date: 2013-07-09 21:24:44
False. Bitcoin address != public key. Bitcoin address is what you get when you take the public key, hash it, and add some extra goodies like a version number and checksum. This is why your private key is safest if the coins have never been spent. Spending your coins requires exposing your public key to the network.
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:01:05
I want one with a keypad with digits 1-6. I want to roll a die 50 times, and type in the sequence of digits. The device should hash that input and give me a private and corresponding public key. Then I get the two things I absolutely need -- true randomness and transparency. Also it would be awesome if it could print out a paper bill. I think this arrangement would provide maximum security and also ease of use.

I'm a big fan of proof-of-stake and wish it would be added to Bitcoin, but I guess it's too late, unless something terrible happens.
Edit: The biggest advantages of Proof of Stake, IMHO, is that it drastically raises cost of a 51% attack, it creates a linear relationship between the resources you expend, and the amount of influence over the blockchain you get, and it takes advantage away from people who happen to run silicon fabs, and distributes it to anyone who can purchase bitcoins.. i.e. everyone.

I'm talking about a fork. If some existential risk happened (like TX fees being too meager to secure the network) then I would hope the network would take a deep breath and hard fork. Maybe re-establish some small inflation target to pay for security. Maybe incorporate proof of stake. I don't think Bitcoin will just say "oh well" and die from a 51 attack.

I do not have to trust the Bitaddress.org webpage however, because the only thing I need it to do is to convert a passphrase into a private key and public address.
I can validate that it does this properly because I can compare its operation to the operation of other brainwallet converters, like brainwallet.org, to verify that it works as advertised.
So long as it performs this function, I don't care what else it does. It could be trying to send my private key to Satoshi Nakamoto for all I care, since I am using it on an offline computer.

I don't have the expertise to be able to do this, and perhaps the algorithm cannot be invented yet. But in principle, it is possible to show that a block has been accepted by people controlling a certain quantity of bitcoin.
This is impossible to counterfeit, and for any crypto-currency in widespread use there will be a substantial market cap so that it is extremely expensive to acquire a majority stake, especially since trying to do so would tend to raise the price.
The other major advantage is that people who can prove that they could spend bitcoins are the kind of people who will be harmed if the price goes down, so they have established that they probably have the correct incentives to deserve influence.

I disagree that it is a race to the bottom. A PoW coin consumes as much in resources as the users are willing to pay. In Bitcoin, that price is accomplished primarily as inflation first, and then as transaction fees later. If it is a race to anything it is a race to achieve the fastest hash for the least amount of electricity and manufacturing cost.
Bitcoin might be over-paying for security, and it would be good to use Proof of Stake and to find ways to dynamically adjust the energy burn rate, but I don't think that it is "unsustainable" or incompatible with a sustainable energy economy in any way. Bitcoin will not continue to burn more and more electricity every year, it will find an equilibrium point where it burns what people are willing to pay in transaction fees.

Well, let's assume there are 4,000 "early adopters" that have a ridiculous number of coins. Let's say these people have at least 5000 coins each.
I think most of these folks will diversify when they get above a net worth of, let's say 20 million dollars. I consider that enough to be independently wealthy and not to have to worry about money for the rest of your days, assuming you don't screw up too bad. It just seems to me that these people will cash out a lot at that point. Why stay 100% in BTC at that point, since BTC is shall we charitably say "untested" in terms of its long term value stability.
For a person with 5000 BTC, that moment comes when the price is only $4,000 per coin. That means that these people will sell when there is still a lot of upside potential to BTC, which the people they sell to will share in.
Maybe a couple of stodgy holdouts will hold their BTC all the way to a billion dollars, ($200k per coin) but I bet not many. So I don't see BTC's rocket ride contributing in a meaningful way to the weath inequality of the world.

In a ponzi scheme, the people who buy in are made a promise that they will receive a certain payout. The person running the scheme honors the payments to those people in order to keep the scheme going. Eventually, as new buyers dry up, the promises to pay cannot be honored so the scheme collapses. With Bitcoin there are no promises, and as it goes up in value rational people will have less and less expectation of a payoff. So eventually it stabilizes at a high value, as it supports transactions and serves as a store of value.

You're doing fine so far. Armory runs on top of Bitcoin-QT to provide more features, it is not an alternative to Bitcoin-QT.
Armory features that I think are exciting are the ability to recover your whole wallet from a passphrase, and the ability to sign transactions with an offline computer and a USB stick.

Wallets do not store coins. Wallets store private keys. You can't dust out a wallet because there is no way to merge two private keys. The only thing you can do is send coins from one address to another address, which would burn up your coins as transaction fees. On the plus side, when you consolidate your coins into a single address it is good for Bitcoin, because it eliminates addresses from the unspent address pool, and because the dust goes to a miner, where it stops being dust (I think... someone jump in here...)

Aha, but stuffing federal reserve notes under a mattress DOES entail a counter-party risk. You are relying on the federal reserve system to not inflate the currency. Many reasonable people foresee high levels of inflation in the future.
Let's take gold coins. If I stuff gold coins under my mattress, then there is no counter-party risk. So gold coins share this valuable attribute with Bitcoin. I have no problem admitting that.
Not every store of value has this attribute. For example, if I am trying to store a lot of gold coins, I might store them in a vault maintained by a third party. Now we have counter-party risk. Or maybe I have money on deposit at the bank of Cyprus. Or maybe I have purchased bonds. Etc.
My point was never that Bitcoin is the only way to store wealth without counterparty risk. My point was just that zero counterparty risk is a desirable attribute of a store of value, and that Bitcoin has it.

I don't know the math, but I'll venture a guess. A private key is 256 bits, which is a number with up to 77 zeroes after it. The corresponding public key is 65 bits, which is a number with 19 zeroes after it. If you divide those, you get a number with 57 zeroes. So I guess there is an upper limit of 1 x 10^57 private keys for each public key. Assuming there are no other constraints on the viable private keys, I think a quantum hacker would steal your coins long before they are able to brute force your private key.

Just for fun:
The cap on Bitcoin is 2,100,000,000,000,000 Satoshi.
Gold is divisible down to the atom.
2,100,000,000,000,000 atoms of gold weighs approximately .0000007 grams.
Therefore, more units of gold are present in a tiny flake of gold leaf than will ever exist of Bitcoin, given the current protocol parameters. Yet that amount of gold would be worth almost zero, and that amount of satoshis is worth billions.

Probably fine to use blockchain.info, however, doing this is less secure than using a client. When you use blockchain.info you are typing your private key into your browser. If you use a client (Bitcoin-QT for example) you type your private key into Bitcoin-QT, which is more secure than typing it into your browser. (You could still be nailed with a windows keylogger of course. If this is a million bucks, consider doing an armory offline signed transaction.)
I agree with the other commenters that it would be better to just create a 2FA blockchain.info account that you keep, rather than using a disposable one. One screwup and your "disposable" blockchain account could be the spot where some of your coins were unintentionally stored.

Obviously there are some state architectures that work better than others. Representative democracy seems to deliver non-shitty results at least some of the time, and I think there are structural changes that could be made to the way voting happens that would improve things over the current status.
Furthermore, we may develop technologies that render states less important or obsolete, like Bitcoin, and I welcome that.

Waste of time worrying about this. You would be stuck dead by a falling meteor before this happened.

But the results (ends) of the actions (means) of those people were bad, so we judge the actions to be bad. So I'm nuts for judging them to be bad?

Yes, it's awesome. The high inflation rate helps counter-act the "unfair advantage" that early adopters have. Right now it seems like the inflation rate and the increase in demand are exactly canceling out, but keep in mind that the inflation rate decreases with every block that is mined (on average) and that demand is likely to accelerate.

A paper wallet is just a private key and associated public address, written on paper. To transfer to it you just send the coins to the public address.

So you and I may not disagree at all on this point. I do agree with you that you cannot eat bitcoins. However, if the goal is to preserve your purchasing power during financial crisis, it is not necessary to obtain things that you can eat.
For example, you can get gold. Gold cannot be eaten, however it has chemical properties that make make people come back to it again and again when they are looking for something to use as money. (durable, divisible, compact, transportable, fungible, recognizable, and scarce)
Like gold, Bitcoin cannot be eaten, but also like gold, Bitcoin has properties that will bring people back to it again and again to use as money. (durable, divisible, compact, transportable, fungible, recognizable, scarce)
Bitcoin is more fragile than gold, in that people could abandon the blockchain and use some other blockchain. That is a risk that is particular to Bitcoin, however I judge that the network effects will prevent this from happening.
Because you can reasonably expect people to desire bitcoin in the future for use as money, you can reasonably expect bitcoin to retain purchasing power, even if there is inflation. That is all I meant, and if I used the wrong terminology, I apologize.

Exactly. Except that its purpose is not anti-spam but to scatter the mining effort.

Yes. Live and let live exists in the protective space carved out by society, and is subject to the limits society chooses to enforce.

I don't know enough about it to comment on the risk of that scenario happening.

First of all, the US constitution does not make distinctions like that. It just says that citizens have the right to bear arms. There are two ways of interpreting the amendment. One is that citizens have a right to bear arms as part of a state-regulated militia to defend the country from outside invaders. Thankfully that viewpoint has been discredited. The other interpretation is that citizens have the right to bear arms so that they can shoot at the federal government when it comes to take away their liberty. How do you expect to defend yourself from the federal government if you do not have access to chemical weapons? You have basically swallowed the propaganda, and allowed yourself to be neutered, and restricted to small arms, which are about as effective as a BB gun when it comes time to fight the US military.
Edit for any FBI who may be listening in, this is satire. I do not believe that people have a right to have chemical weapons, and I think that our country would be much better off if gunpowder sales were strictly regulated.
Further edit: I think it is bullshit that people treat the founding fathers as though they had a telegraph line to god, and he gave them the constitution. Opinions need to stand or fall on their merits, not on whether some guy in a wig held them.

In this scenario, when you create more money, who do you give it to?
