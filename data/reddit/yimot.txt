What happens when an exchange doesn’t support bech32? You can’t send to them? You can get from them? I don’t understand it.

That means your btc now are worth more. It is great for everyone.

But do you have to commit a certain money to open this second channel?? And the transaction is only real when you upload it to the main chain, right?

Bitcoin is obviously not dead so honestly I’m still hoping is drops so I can buy more
@_date: 2019-02-23 09:02:59
Thank you very much
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:12:57
But not proof of residence or payments or something like that, right?

What is the difference between the second and third graph

Great, thank you for your time.

Thank you. Do you know if you need a lot of documentation to buy bitcoins?

Imo there’ll be one day in which btc price will stabilize and people will start using it more regularly. Right now it hasn’t reached its full potential and people are holding because they expect the price to rise

Bitcoin is a tool. It can be used for the good or for the bad. Just like a knife is not unethical even though many many people have been killed with one.

I want one!!

I’m no expert by any means. I’m more of a noob so it’d be stupid of me to try to make a guess. There are some people on the internet that say prices should rise to 100k up to 2M but I have no idea tbh. I recommend you do some research and try to understand how experts estimate the value of btc so you can make your own conclusions.

Hahaha it’s up to her 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:53:03
Thank you!

I would love it if it said the percentage that goes up or down rather than the actual value in the price column or the portfolio section. Otherwise is pretty good.
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:58:54
I know but what I mean is that even if it was not bitcoin would still be relevant
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:04:23
If bitcoin was what that guy said I would have never guy it in the first place. I understand it is hard to explain something as complex as bitcoin in tv but I think “it’s the best performing asset of the decade” is not something important. Bitcoin was definitely one of the worst performing assets last couple of years and I kept buying it
