It's feels great to invest in your future and the planets at the same time.

Acceptable by the engineers engineering bitcoin to achieve the use/purpose of the project.

That sounds like a great idea.  Is that needed?  Are there not people who do this on the testnet?  I am mostly a frontend webdev, and have been looking for a way to contribute to bitcoin.  I'm going to look into this.  Thank you.  If you are familiar with how to work with the testnet, i'd love to talk to more.
Also, I had a good talk about all this on the bitcoin core slack and they brought up more considerations that need to be addressed before the ones I asked should be.
Thanks for the post!

I would be satisfied to know who is currently focused on this area of bitcoin dev.  I am sure there is someone.  It's a $140B project.  I want to follow that person/team and learn from them.

I've spent a lot of time weighing if it's more valuable for me to spend it now to help achieve my goals and lead to a happier life, or maintain where I am and save it for retirement.
Ultimately I think that if I can reach my goal of doing what I love for a living, I don't think I'll ever really fully retire.
While I took a big risk in bitcoin, and have been rewarded for it, I think it's a better long-term value to reinvest part of the earnings into my self now.

Heh, sorry.  I realize now this might be a little too technical for reddit
