Yes. Arcbit stealth addresses are compatible with those of other wallets.

Since importing bitcoin private keys is something that is mainly use by experience bitcoin users we kept that feature hidden. Go to settings and toggle on advance mode to expose that feature.

ArcBit here. Hey Aaron. Thanks for the compliments. It means a lot coming from you as the creator of BreadWallet. It is indeed a server trusting wallet, but I would liked to add that you can choose which block explorer you want to trust. Currently we offer Insight and blockchain.info. I still recommend BreadWallet for those who want a pure Bitcoin wallet.

Thanks for the tip Aaron!
I have tried to use to use Chain, but they were lacking in features to make it usable. Blockchain.info has its problems but it has a very useful API method, /multiaddr, which all the other APIs do not have. Insight was an obvious because it was open source and all, but it has it problems too. For example,  the Insight API give amounts in Bitcoins which are decimal numbers when they should be giving it in Satoshis. So neither blockchain.info and Insight are perfect. Haven't taken a look at Blockcypher yet, it maybe worth a look.

Hi locuester, if you happen to be the same locuester that gave ArcBit one of its first App Store reviews. Your comment about wanting the ability to archive the default account is duly noted, and you can look forward to seeing that feature added sometime in the future.
