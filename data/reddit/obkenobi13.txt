Thanks for sharing, but it‘s mostly a reflection of what happened in 2017...

I think it would be quite healthy for the overall crypto space if we saw a major correction in the altcoin frenzy, which would have a positive impact on btc.

I think many people understand the broader vision of bitcoin but it is often based on a very superficial understanding of its key components/drivers (e.g. encryption, information age leading to weakening of traditional institutions). It leads people to fanatically cling to an ideal which discounts some of the real technical flaws that beget bitcoin today.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:21:37
I hope the shakeout will continue even more viciously with shitcoins (probably like 90% of alts) with a flight to quality. I‘m not trying to be a douche bag but I think it would be healthy for the overall crypto space because a lot of people do not seem to have learned the broader lesson yet.

There is a lot of positive news in the economy that will further stoke stock markets (trumps tax plan, profit repatriation, direct investment) well into 2018/2019.

Not trying to hate but the article was mainly discussing developer activity and increasing adoption of Bitcoin in 2017. It doesn't give you an indication of whether prices are reasonable at these levels or should continue to trend upwards. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:35:11
Oh pls don‘t get me wrong, I‘m absolutely with you. I believe there will be a much bigger crash than 2008 in due time, as we have simply been moving from a housing- to an even bigger sovereign debt bubble. I‘m just observing that previous stock market bubbles have picked up steam towards the end of their lifecycles. These phases can take a year or even longer.

If you‘re in it for the long haul and you can afford to lose that money then hodl. Lots of altcoins will be in for a rude awakening at some point.

Institutional money pumping up prices followed by disillusioned small stock investors and then a general frenzy with dumb money joining the fray. I think it will be a wild year (and an even wilder crash).
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:21:07
The Internet was/is a game-changing technology yet people were way too irrationally exuberant on the short-term impact it would have so a bubble formed and eventually popped. 
The least you could do is honestly ask yourself whether you should shell out your life-savings at these prices when in fact the technology is still in its very early stages. 
I do however absolutely agree with you on the long-term growth prospects. But we're talking 5-10 years..
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:45:15
If 2018 is the year where institutional money joins the game then 25k is indeed a conservative estimate.

Dude I wasn‘t whining about anything. I was simply asking based on what assumptions he thought prices should just keep increasing. I‘m simply challenging the notion that prices will keep rising forever. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:05:48
I think another reason for a continued bull run in 2018 is the stock market. Lots of gains made in stocks may be shifted into crypto as risk appetite grows.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:59:26
People need to be careful out there and start preparing for scenarios when prices go south. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:53:27
I think another catalyst is the full employment situation in the US. As the economy is further stimulated lots of companies will have to increase salaries or have done so already (see Walmart as an example) which increases consumer spending also. At the same time you have new technology being more broadly deployed which enhances productivity and hence keeps inflation rates low. I think this might go on for a while.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:53:46
Why is everybody expecting the price to go up by default? Is there any fundamentally sound reason it should go up?
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:04:08
IF the LN gets rolled out and IF institutional investors join the party it may easily approach 40k sometime this year. But let‘s be honest, we have reached bubble territory (taking the alt coin frenzy as an indicator) so it may very well pop before year‘s end.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:22:05
So because of greater user adoption in 17 there will be even greater user adoption in 18. Sound argument.

@_date: 2018-01-14 10:53:24
Crash is more likely IMHO. Not because of btc but due to the craze in the general crypto market especially in regards to speculative alts. The current price still reflects a swath of institutional money flowing in, which I see as less likely due this frothy market situation.  Once people realize the old chick with the big purse isn‘t coming to the party to buy everybody free drinks this market will go south. But I also might totally overrate the rationality of institutional investors so who knows.

@_date: 2018-01-14 14:35:29
The point I‘m trying to make is that if everybody expects the price to just go up there must be a forward looking assumption about the future, not what happened in the past.

I think people are way too optimistic about wall street bonuses having a material impact. Total bonuses paid out on wallstreet are about 30-40 billion.

Agreed in principal but South Korea is one of the biggest crypto markets. This might be a more pronounced sell-off. Coupled with the froth in altcoins a flood of weak hands may accentuate it.

There is a sense of accomplishment in the btc community which is making me uncomfortable. The technology is still at not mature so there is a lot of work to be done but all you see is people talking about getting rich. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:15:48
Look nobody knows but it‘s prudent to account for downside risks too. Especially in this situation. So don‘t invest recklessly.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:25:31
In order to short big you need a corresponding willingness to go long. As an institutional investor I‘d try to push up the price and get people to buy before moving into a substantial short position.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:26:42
You will have to come to your own conclusion because we're all kind of throwing darts in the dark. But imo the volume of wall street bonuses isn't nearly big enough to have a substantial impact on btc. Perhaps it will drive up prices of some highly speculative alts, who knows.
I think also people are way too optimistic about swaths of institutional money flowing in after the crazy market behavior you're seeing in crypto right now.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:05:55
I must say that when reading through online communities like this subreddit than these words of caution strongly resonate.

I think you misread my post. That‘s exactly the point I was trying to make.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:39:20
Agreed. But it won't pave the way to a transformed society by itself. Firstly, it needs a strong developer community working on the tech, which in bitcoin's case seems to be fading in certain respects. And secondly, the wider community needs to understand the technology, in what ways it can transform society, and then actively promoting it to the outside world. All I'm seeing are memes about lambo and the latest price increase.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:59:36
I think you're raising a great point. People for the first time feel they are invested into a cause and are not being shut out by an elite structure. I think this is the most powerful dynamic of the current mania. 
But it's exactly the great promise of this movement which I fear is being flushed down the drain. We have a chance to build a new system but all that people seem to look forward to is becoming rich quick and become a part of the very system this movement intends to replace.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:44:47
But are you honestly thinking that this is the case right now? Are people really thinking about these societal questions? Do they try to understand how blockchain can actually transform the financial system?
I agree with you, there is nothing wrong with becoming rich along the way at all. But I prefer becoming rich by contributing my sweat and blood to a cause I believe in, not by posting bullshit memes and expecting that somehow I'm entitled a handsome award for this.
This is the issue Vitalik is trying to raise.

I wished there was more discussion beyond bitcoin here because it’s the promise of the underlying technology that can disrupt many of these businesses and processes in the financial system / real economy. Bitcoin really is just the very first phase of a major transition which in its entirety will be indeed the biggest shift of wealth we‘ve ever seen. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:30:42

@_date: 2017-12-28 02:27:44
Not saying that there is no progress but biggest problem I have is that only few seem to be interested in the technology and what societal impact it could have. Everybody wants to ride bitcoin in order to get rich quick. If that's the only use case than this is nothing else than a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:09:14
It‘s people with the vision of creating a digital economy that is not only massively more efficient but more just in how wealth is distributed vs. legacy fat cats who siphon off wealth through financial and political channels that flows into their own pockets. Seeing this change as a bunch of randos replacing another bunch of randos is a quiet cynical pov imo.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:32:42
That's not the issue. The issue is that objectively we have achieved very little (not only bitcoin but the whole crypto community) yet there is a wide sense of achievement that has everybody thinking that all we have to do is buy crypto and just sit back and watch the price get to the moon. Nobody is really interested in the technology.. absolutely no movement about how it could impact society and how to promote it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:47:35

There is a lot of technical innovation right now, some of which is rather experimental. Even though  I think it will take another couple of years until we see more widespread adoption it’s probably the most exciting time now to build on top of Lightning. 
One example is the ability to run a lightning node on your mobile device which will enable tons of interesting use cases.
I encourage you to follow Lightning Lab’s blog. They have a lot of interesting articles which are non technical.

You fail to grasp the point that legacy banking is just one way of providing financial services. The whole point of crypto, which seems to entirely escape you, is for sovereign individuals to manage their finances without having to rely on centralized third parties. 
When you‘re leveraging this trustless technology and embed this in a system which is inherently centralized then you‘re just not getting it.

That’s simply not true. Not even the bigger exchanges like Binance or Coinbase have a banking license. Pure wallet services are mainly non-banking entities. Also for crypto custodial solutions you don’t need to have a banking license.

If profit was the only motive then you were willingly buying into a ponzi scheme. Without the ideology behind it it‘s really just a ponzi scheme. 
And I respectfully disagree. I think a lot of people people were initially convinced by the vision but got completely blinded by greed.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:16:00
Agreed in principle, but I think it will take a while longer for this to unravel. I think many are underestimating the productivity potential of technology to fight labor shortages which could have a dampening effect on interest rates. Especially with the repatriation of profits we may see a lot of this capital being deployed in productivity-enhancing technology, especially in industries where adoption as been slow.
But the day of reckoning will come at some point.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:57:06
If I know that I have part of my money stashed away that nobody can touch and no central bank can inflate away then this is an actual utility for me, not just ideology.

Censorship resistance means that nobody can prevent valid transactions from being confirmed. So you are free to transact with whoever you choose.
Monero and ZCash introduce the privacy aspect on top of what btc provides but it makes it significantly slower than even btc. But I agree that privacy can be a very desirable property for some people as well.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:25:24
Let‘s remind ourselves here why we bought btc in the first place: a censorship resistant and permissionless system where no fucking institution tells me with whom I am allowed to transact with. This is an investment that bets against a repressive system built and maintained by corrupt governments and corporations that serve their own needs. If you still haven‘t grasped this then please sell all your coins and GTFO.

I think you are grossly underestimating the risks in the current financial and political system and the value of protecting your wealth against these downside risks. You need to look at vehicles like gold and offshore investments that have similar properties in order to evaluate what btc may or may not be worth.
