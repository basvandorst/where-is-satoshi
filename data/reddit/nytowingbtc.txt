It is obvious you had a rough towing experience, and I'm sorry for that. With our company, on the contrary, we're charging the standard prices for local tows. Not sure where you got this $400 figure, unless you did a long range tow and the driver charged you an outrageous fee per mile. 
 
If you are in the Queens area and get stuck - give us a call. I assure that you will have a much more pleasant experience with us. Thanks!

Crypto-Locker is a malware dedicated to locking your machines, and requesting a ransom. What we do is help you if you get stuck somewhere, need a tow, ran out of gas or locked yourself out - we'll come to help you with the situation. We're also licensed to do recoveries - so if you need us to recover your vehicle, we can do this for you as well. Mostly this means, if your car has been impounded we can be used to tow your car out of the impound after you pay your fines. The marshal lots require a licensed tow truck to pull your vehicle out of their lots - and not be driven out by customers. Hope that clears it up. Thanks!

Not a loaded question at all. I actually got involved in Bitcoin last year, and ended up helping a friend build some projects. I've also been doing Roadside Assistance, tows and recoveries for several years. So I figure I'd start my own company, and accept Bitcoin. I think it is a win-win situation for people who get stuck, and don't have cash readily available or prefer to use Bitcoin.
