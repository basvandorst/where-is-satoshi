Obligatory Inception reference.

Apparently so :)

Yes, exactly. p2p or crowdsourcing. No more bail-outs for banks making stupid decisions.

I'm writing a book about Bitcoin. Does that make me an expert?

We will only be able to lend things that actually exist. It will be great.

Good. Co-ops are a great community model.

Nice! I wanted to get some hemp body moisturiser. 
Great Prices, too, if I was just a little more hasty to buy my bitcoins :) Please let me know how you are working out your BTC prices? 
I'll order as soon as BTC reaches $130, or sooner if I can get an affiliate discount, and put your link up on my site, post to facebook etc :) I'd love to be a UK reseller, actually. I believe in what we are doing here, so much! Hemp + Bitcoin = Happy. Welcome to the future. Let's pump it up!

I copied the public keys to the doc - so I could send the BTC to them.

If i bought your Moisturizing Cream 4oz. - Sweet Orange in pounds with paypal, it would be £11.73 which I think is fabulous. even when that's almost half shipping (I'm in the UK). If I add a styling wax, that's $28, or 0.25 BTC, which is $26.00 at time of writing, I economise on shipping.
0.25 BTC is £17.02  and exactly $26 on Preev right now, so that's a just right, except I bought my bitcoins last week (Sunday, before the BIG rise) and  got 0.1BTC for £11. 11x2.5  means I paid £27.50 which is $40.06 (so a loss of $22 for me on the products compared to the paypal price) for those, so I need to wait on my BTC for a little bit, while they blossom. Unless I can get the price down to 0.19. I just made an EP - 6 tracks dubsteppy, atmospheric EDM. I'll add it in to the offer! 
How about it: 0.19 BTC plus the ryanthegecko vs The Victoria Line EP, and a link on my website, and a facebook post, for a 4Oz hemp orange moisturiser and a 4Oz stylling wax.

Yeah, you are, dude. If you can get one.
