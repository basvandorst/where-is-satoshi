If you look at a graph of it in the long term the overall trendline puts btc at about 15k today. 6 months ago I was saying 10k by Christmas, and it has totally exceeded expectations. Right now anyone who had invested in btc 2 months ago is extremely happy. 
Additionally, a large portion of the overall crypto market is in a bubble. Most of the altcoins will be worthless in the mid-long term. Btc, eth are the only somewhat safe plays imo. The rest is gambling unless you have good inside info. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:44:21
Its got extreme volatility why wouldnt it hit 20k again?

Bitcoin is literally not a ponzi scheme. It does not fit the conditions of a Ponzi because you actually receive what you pay for... bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-07 13:09:37
Bitcoin represents ownership in something, too. A ponzi scheme means that you're really never receiving what you paid for. But you get what you pay for with bitcoin: whole or parts of bitcoin. 
You're not making a good case for why bitcoin should be considered a ponzi. I recommend thinking it through a bit more.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:26:37
That's still not a Ponzi Scheme. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:52:23
Keep all the crypto on an exchange so that they can take care of the security. Then they're basically your bank. Super easy and secure.

@_date: 2017-12-23 15:27:38
Obviously. But I'm pointing out the relative advantages to having someone vociferously defending the project. A leader would have that role.
Im just pointing out the pitfalls of a leaderless, decentralized system, and not even saying it should be changed. It could be someone with zero financial incentive who just wants to advocate for the bitcoin revolution. If a strong proponent with good guidance was making a strong case the market would be far more stable.

What are the best coins that handle scaling in your opinion? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:57
It is BCash and always will be, however the name "bitcoin" is legendary. "Bitcoin" is cryptocurrency to the average person. Bitcoin invented the space. Its a very valuable brand. The brand name alone is worth billions in market recognition. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:08:16
The government doesn't produce value so I fail to see how it could provide a UBI without debt spending. 
As far as police, people are far more law abiding than is shown on the news or in police reports. Police create the need for themselves. Like in the drug war for instance. 
If someone isn't infringing on someone else's rights there is no need for state interference. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:09:48
It would never result in a damn thing. Besides the inevitable inaccuracies it's too slow.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:56:54
Bitcoin has adhered to market forces thus far. I believe in the free market to do the right thing. Losses are risks of investing in speculative assets. Just like buying gold or silver. Think of all the old people who have lost big money in gold and silver thanks to scare tactic commercials on Fox news.... Bitcoin is infinitely more ethical and moral than hawking special metals... there's literally zero marketing pressure making people purchase. 
I do think it is revolutionary as well. It could actually take over the world if it were scalable. If it weren't for the actual scaling issues and attacks by early investors like Roger Ver it could be unassailable in its rise. 
If it were immediately available with the same capacity as credit card companies it could actually displace established currencies. It would be at 100k a bitcoin in no time. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:09:46
That's the whole point of false flags.

A lot of words I'll never read. Though I did catch the "mkay" at the end and that pretty much disqualifies you from any meaningful discourse.

@_date: 2017-12-18 08:00:29
I disagree. You might have a more vibrant tech economy because there is a freer market. But government always tends to corrupt. The fundamental question is the scope of government. And it's scope should not include regulating the industry. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:55:24

Why do you say that a long bear period? Aren't most retail investors just now getting into the space?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:44:56
Its not a ponzi scheme, as the buyers are actually receiving what they want out of the transaction: a bitcoin. Ponzi "schemes" fail because the fund manager isn't actually allocating the funds to investment, like they're directed. So there's a fundamental difference in that regard. 
No one has promised unlimited returns in bitcoin. No manager is directing that bitcoin be marketed as yielding high returns. It just has the effect of increasing in value as more people buy into it, because of the coded scarcity. It's possible to think of bitcoin at a million dollars, because it actually is possible. Enough people believing in it would have that effect. 
Bitcoin has no direct comparison in history. Calling it a Ponzi scheme is simply technically incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:41:53
Exactly this. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:03:57

The Mayo Clinic is maybe the best in the world and it's private. Beyond that you're pigeonholing a very large discussion into a small niche. Without government funding and the removal of taxation you would see far greater research done for all types of healthcare. Government impedes health research. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:02:36
Agreed, which is why they'd be incentivized to put out a warning if they knew of some kind of impending price crash/disaster. They don't send out emails very often so it's pretty significant that they'd send one out like this.

It's bullshit they've got it sitting at $4500 per BCH. That's clearly an inflated price. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:50:09
Taxation is theft, and the government does not provide services anything close to the money they confiscate through theft. In fact, they really only use tax payer money to pay debt on borrowed money. And the "borrowed" money is another way they steal from a compliant citizenry.
Why are you in crypto if you believe in the goodness of the government? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:05:23
Look up what a parabola is and then compare that to the 1 yr chart for bitcoin. It doesn't necessarily mean anything. It's just interesting.

You're the one spouting off irrational attacks. Nothing you've said has been based in logic. My comment is firmly rooted in logic... See if you can follow....
If government has failed to cure cancer, after wasting billions, and 99% of money spent on research is wasted, as you said, I don't see how you can say government funding is a success, or will be a success in the future.

If you knew who you were talking to we'd both have a laugh, as I've been more successful, and will continue to be more successful than you ever have been or will be.

Greater consumer privacy? Give me a break. While the regulation was in effect we saw consumers lose more privacy than any other time in history. And as far as fostering competition... bullshit. Is that why there was more consolidation under NN than ever before?

Because the government holds monopolies over public construction. However, billionaires often build roads and buildings and other huge projects. They just do it on their private land. Some of the most amazing projects I've ever seen have been totally private funded. 
As for curing cancer the best hospitals in the world are privately funded endeavors. 
So you can ignore these things and praise shit-government, or you can realize all this stuff does happen privately for exception of space where government holds public monopolies. 
Everything the government does is done better by private entities and individuals. And why are you interested in crypto if you're a blind believer in government? Just stick with the dollar or euro... other failed public endeavors. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:04:28
People always have reasons to buy, sell, and move it around. Plenty will happen. It would actually be better if 99% are holding and only 1% are ever selling. 
That's how banks dont lose their asses. If everyone was moving around money at once the fractional reserve system would cease to function. And if we really want Bitcoin to be huge, the price and market needs to grow huge. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:00:11

Hmm thats interesting you only see coercion as a means of accomplishing your ends. Typical statist. 
I understand your point of view, but it's wrong, and influenced by a lack of real world experience, as is typical for people that are the most smug and certain. 
I guess you've never been in the oilfields throughout America... Oil companies regularly build sprawling networks of roads, bridges and other infrastructure solely to provide access to their measly wells. In fact, they do so at virtually no cost within their larger budgets. And people willingly give up land just to be a part of it, and in return they get paid, and receive access to roads they wouldn't have otherwise had. 
The problem with government planning IS unconstitutional things like eminent domain. People will fight when they are coerced and forced. Usually, given a financial incentive, and a better connection to roads and thoroughfares, people will gladly sell or lease land to build roads. And private companies, individuals, groups will build better roads, and better infrastructure at no cost compared to the government, without the endemic corruption and graft that exists inherent to the government. 
Have you never seen housing developments? Those roads are better than anything government has ever planned, and it's always private. You just seem to lack real world experience, and are one of the bovine losers that follows the "government good" narrative without questioning.

These people are what you call dumb money and they cause distortions of stupidity in the markets. It's ok, rational thought and reason usually win out. 
Bitcoin's greatest problem is bitcoin itself. BTC should become the world standard, but attackers like bcash, and the legitimate issues with scaling are it's biggest pitfalls at this moment. 
The devs should be in crisis mode right now. There is legitimate risk to bitcoin survival, and no one should want btc to fail except for those who stand to economically gain from its demise. 
I saw an interesting comment about there being a lack of leadership in btc, where bch has Ver. If btc had a CEO leader right now they could right the ship and settle things down, but right now the S.S. Bitcoin is taking cannonballs to the stern from pirates, and it needs a captain to set shit straight.

It's cringier to listen to statist fools like yourself fighting for your own oppression. It's the ultimate stockholm syndrome. And being forced to move because of a tyrannical government is not a choice. Like I said, you have no idea whether I've moved or not, but needing to move because of a corrupt, thieving government is not a choice. At best it's extortion. 
Murder is murder whatever you call it. You can call it legal killing, but it's still murder. Lol. Just life theft by the government is still theft.

You have no idea about my situation, and regardless that you're wrong you'll continue with your smug attitude which seems to be an endemic affliction of statists like yourself. It also seems like you're the only angry person in this discussion, which is ironic. 
As for it being a choice whether to get taxed or not, its not. If you have to move to avoid getting taxed than you really don't have a choice do you? Whether it's written into the laws or not doesn't circumvent it being theft. If it were written into the laws that murdering people was legal, it would still be murder to kill someone.

If you misunderstood it's because your reading comprehension is shit. As I clearly said regulations LIKE net neutrality have caused the consolidation of media. The government shouldn't even be allowed in the media space. We wouldn't have such top-down monopolies if the government didn't hobble smaller ISP's and media companies with onerous regulations and draconian laws that only the super giant firms can navigate. 
If you really wanted more choice, competition, privacy and affordability immediately get rid of all government intrusion into the space.

8mb blocks lead to centralization because the blockchain is already so big to download that an average person can't run a node when they have to download the blockchain at 8x the size. Thus, with larger blocks you will have centralized nodes that are capable or want to do the 8mb blockchain. 
It's easier for the average person to do a 1mb blockchain node than a 8mb chain.

Crypto is a natural reaction to the perennial theft by governments through taxation and the continual theft from citizens through inflation and devaluation.

Look at the state of the industry... you have the burden of proof to show that regulations are doing good.

Its hilarious that you're making a wide-ranging statement of fact that is completely wrong with even the most shallow of glances. You can literally google "private cancer research" and you could never finish scrolling through the infinite number of private contributions. 
The government actually impedes cancer research more than it has ever helped. Government institutionalizes inequality, inequity in research, and gives perverse incentives which prevent cancer research from being successful.

The problem is the scope of government. It has no reason to regulate that industry. 
Arguing about specific regulations is a smokescreen, when the real focus should be "does the government really need to be involved, and why?" In most cases it does not.

@_date: 2017-08-12 15:12:35
This is exactly right. Based on past instances of competing currencies against the dollar Bitcoin is walking a fine line between illegality and a gray area. 
If BTC becomes more accepted transactionally over time it will come under fire by the government, and that could kill it. Also, I wouldn't doubt that parts of the exchanges have already been compromised by intelligence agencies. Like the flash crash for Ethereum it wouldn't surprise me if that was a test run. 
HOWEVER, if the block chain technology works as promised, the currency will retain value. The real value of BTC is as a global currency, and as an anonymous currency freed from the federal reserve and global banking system.
For now it seems safe, but once you hear the politicians talking about it then we've got a problem. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:18:24
I understand the point you're trying to make, but your point is flawed. 
I never said you shouldn't use companies to facilitate your transactions, only that the ultimate responsibility lies with the user. BTC investors need to understand the inherent risks involved with transactions, the reliability of the companies they're using to facilitate transactions, and understand that they only truly own bitcoin if they hold the private keys in offline hardware. 
Like I said initially, this whole thing (crypto) is BUYER BEWARE. Do your due diligence, and only use services that you've researched thoroughly. It's like most things with life. If you do your due diligence you're less likely to get screwed, if you don't... don't expect others to take responsibility.

I'm a big believer in "Buyer Beware"... People commit money to these investments before ever studying the complexity and risks involved. If they lose money or get screwed it's usually because they didn't take care of their investment properly, and over-relied on a third party service. 
If you're in BTC you are the ONLY one responsible for taking care of your investment. No one is going to do it for you. 
It's like buying a used car... you buy AS-IS, so you need to check it out mechanically, test drives.... the only person with responsibility is you. If you buy a lemon it's your fault.

I've been thinking this same thing for a while now. I think you're correct. Govs. have every incentive to shut BTC down in the future. The US literally has a law against the formation of other currencies, China can shut down their citizens internet whenever they want, and an innumerable amount of other govs. have an incentive to shut down a largely deflationary asset vs their inflationary fiat currencies. 
The number one risk versus BTC is envious govs and central banks shutting it down. And anyone who says it's not possible to cripple BTC is a fool. If they wanted to shut it down they could shut it down. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:33:54

I've actually never done it before but it seems easier. Send money and send bitcoin and your done. With an exchange your submitting info, waiting a lot of time, dealing with wire transfers into the exchange, plus whatever other problems happen in the meantime. And an exchange like Coinbase has limits.

@_date: 2017-08-12 16:45:20
It's not too late to stop it. If the federal government started prosecuting large participants in bitcoin they could kill the currency. There are thousands of regulations and statutes... gov prosecutors could easily find enough violations to kill large market participants. 
For instance, prosecute the CEO of Coinbase and you could effectively kill consumer interest in the currency. Not to mention the thousands of other things the federal government could bring to bear. 
There is no checkmate against a super power gov. If it wanted to kill the value of bitcoin it could do it within a week. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:16:49
Obviously you can not prosecute a protocol, but you can prosecute people that participate in that system. And when you do that you destroy the incentive to take part in that system. I think blockchain technology is nearly unassailable, but participants in the market are not. 
If the gov decided to destroy bitcoin it would do so by destroying the lives of large participants, not by attacking the blockchain technology.

@_date: 2017-08-15 18:02:30
I didn't say there's zero trust. I said you need to due diligence on the companies you transact with to protect yourself. And ultimately the responsibility is on you to protect your investment. If you want the best security go get a hardware wallet... 
And what establishment? The whole idea of bitcoin is a decentralized store of value or currency. There's not one single bitcoin establishment. It's a huge range of individuals and companies who happen to own parts of the overall currency.

You don't seem to grasp the full power of government to destroy people's lives for nothing. All it would take is large scale prosecution of large market participants to plunge bitcoin into an abyss. The gov could easily prosecute large crypto exchanges for some kind of "securities violations" and destroy people's lives, and destroy the easy entrance to the BTC marketplace. 
I'm an investor in bitcoin, and I want it to become a serious alternative to debt-based currencies, but I'm not dumb enough to delude myself into thinking the government couldn't destroy it if they decide to. All it takes is prosecutions. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:40:26

I do agree that the government is more interested in utilizing BTC right now than destroying it. It's highly possible that the CIA and other institutions are using it to further their ends. If you think about it they have the most to profit, especially in the short term.

@_date: 2017-08-12 16:40:29
The US government might not be able to kill it in one fell swoop, but they could destroy the currency pretty easily if they started prosecuting big participators in bitcoin. Prosecute the CEO of Coinbase for one of the thousands of regulations/statutes that exist and you could effectively kill consumer interest. 
I pray that this doesn't happen, but the gov in its current form is malevolent. Bitcoin would continue to exist, but in a fractured and underground way. It's value would plunge.

Don't have time to comment on your whole post, but using the value of different phones as an analogy is weak. For one thing phones aren't used as a store of value. 
A more apt analogy is to compare crypto currencies with fiat currencies. You can compare and use Dollars, Euros, Rubles, Pesos... having choices of these currencies doesn't necessarily devalue the others. Instead, the price fluctuations between a basket of currencies provides risk stabilization and hedging opportunities. In the same way having a variety of fiat currencies actually stabilizes the fiat market, numerous crypto currencies steadies the digital money market.

What's wrong with pointing out Muslim conquests versus the crusades?
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:00:40
What the fuck are you giving me all this apologist bullshit for? My comment asked what's wrong with comparing Muslim versus Christian conquests... Nothing even controversial about that, but you seem to be shilling for an (unworthy) cause. 
Accordingly, in response to your wrong headed, mealy mouthed post I've only got a bit to say. I've traveled more than you ever will, and probably understand the nature of humanity in far greater clarity than you could ever hope to. 
As far as Muslims are concerned their religion is inherently wrong. I won't list the numerous immoralities and failings of their perverted belief system, as they've been listed to exhaustion in readily available sources, but I will say that the followers hold the responsibility for the current sick, violent iterations of the ideology, and far too few Muslims stand against the horrors perpetrated in the name of their allah. Christians had their reformation, Islam never has, and it continues in its sick and perverted path. 
There is a legitimate question whether Islam belongs in a civilized society, and whether it's adherents do either. It's also worth pointing out that Christians moving to Muslim majority countries doesn't happen, and the Christians that do exist in Muslim countries have been slaughtered throughout the years. Muslims have a lot to atone for, yet they fail to do so. They continue to move en masse to Christian countries in order to reap the benefits of western freedom, while asserting their sick ideology, and refusing to assimilate. 
I can honestly say if I never heard another Muslim call to prayer I'd be happy. It's a symbol of a sick, twisted ideology and the earth will be a better place if it's stamped out. Conversely. I'd prefer if the Middle East wars never happened, and I wish Western forces would pull out all troops, but I also believe there's no place for modern Islam in western society. Of course, the US has freedom of religion, but the adherents shouldn't be allowed entry or citizenship in the first place. And that's coming from a man who's traveled to many Muslim countries, and who now realizes there are some societies worth continuing and some that aren't.

I doubt many people in bitcoin fall for the victimhood bullshit. If anything, people who use Bitcoin are standalone, intelligent, and self-sufficient. 
Also, you don't know the meaning of the word misogynist if you think my comment was that. Prove me wrong. I stand by my statement that the vast majority of bitcoin millionaires are men.

Yeah I'm fucking serious. Women don't want to go into technology, aren't interested a majority of the time, and prefer other jobs/professions. There's literally nothing wrong with that. 
Why do we need to force women to do things that they don't want to do? There's nothing at all stopping them from tech/blockchain, but they're generally not interested. 
Why do we need an equal breakdown of men and women? So fucking dumb when people try to act like we need to fix shit that women chose on their own. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:29:11
Good point. I bought on the dip, does that make me a hero too?? No one needs to do bitcoin favors... we just need to ensure it's the best protocol and best store of value on the market. 
And yeah this man was solely motivated by money just like me. We need to cut down on the "hero" thing. Not every cop is a hero, not every firefighter is a hero, and definitely not every crypto buyer is a hero. There are maybe 10 actual heros per year in the United States and none of them get paid to be.

Well it basically is 1:1, though this isn't vegas, because he probably could have bought the S2X coins at the same price after the fork that he bought the futures for. It seemed as if most people were going to be dumping so he could have bought the same number of S2X coins after the fork, without the risk of the coin never existing, lol.

If you're going to make a high stakes bet you're far better off doing so with a high payoff available in the odds. There was VERY LITTLE upside to what he did, especially since he could have bought the same amount of 2X after the split, without the risk of losing everything. 
Buying 85k in futures of a non-existent product is dumb, it's even dumber when there aren't high enough odds to justify the bet. It wasn't a 10:1 payout it wasn't even a 1:1 payout. He probably could have bought the same of amount of 2X AFTER the split for the same price or maybe even cheaper since so many people were intent on dumping it immediately. 
The guy is a retard. One of the greatest things about crypto these days is the hilarious memes of retards doing their thing. Yesterday we had the guy who deleted 150mil in value of ethereum �� and today we have this dumbass who made a big bet with the shittiest odds... ever? ��.

Eh, with only a small amount more of investor interest the price could be way higher. You may think the price is high, because it is relative to 2013, but even 1% of the market capitalization of the US stock market into bitcoin would cause the price to rise into the hundreds of thousands.

There hasn't been a significant innovation in money for over 100 years. In the past there was gold, silver, and other items of inherent value. Then came the central banks controlled by the government over a 100 years ago, and there hasn't been an innovation since. 
Yet, the central banks have failed the population and their money in lots of places has failed, and in almost every place it's continually devalued through inflation... especially the US dollar. 
And then comes bitcoin. The first actual innovation to money since central banks. It's the first and arguably best crypto currency that allows people to act independently of a government sponsored currency. That alone has value. People now are able to hold a store of wealth independent of the meddling of a central figure. So the value is decided by the people who want to use this innovation. The people who own bitcoin, the people who are using it, and the people who want to have it are now validating and valuating it. 
It's value comes from it being the first innovation in an otherwise stagnant space. People are deciding it's value based on how much they want to be a part of this innovation.

@_date: 2017-11-13 15:16:11
If there were an award for stupid comments yours would definitely place, if not win outright. First of all, "everyone" won't do anything all at once. There will be plenty of people who take profits, as they did at 4000, 5000, 6000 &amp; 7000. That's a healthy and normal market.
Second of all, 30% increase is a very nice profit, though from this price it's about 40%, and to 12k its 50%. You won't find a better, more secure return on an easy investment. Sure, you could buy alts but there is far more risk and you don't own the equivalent of digital gold. Also, don't forget that many people expect prices far higher - 20k, 50k in the mid to long term. You won't find a better outlook than that.
As far as going with "another company" for better profits... wow. Bitcoin isn't a company. It's a currency/medium of exchange/store of value, not a company. So it looks like you have no idea what you're talking about, and you sound like an abject fool. The purpose of dips, corrections, and market upheavals is to shake blabbering idiots like you out of the market. You're probably a child or just a malformed adult. People will get rich and you'll still be writing dumb comments.

I think alts are actually really important to crypto, but the vast majority serve no purpose other than to enrich the developers and transfer wealth from idiot neckbeards. 
We need Alts for new applications, competition, diversity in investment. They are important, but with so many SHIT coins inundating the market it's hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. If there were 90% fewer coins people could reasonably invest in the good ones without digging through piles of shit to find the useful ones.

Yeah, I mean, you've got to also point out that bitcoin will probably fare better than the dollar as far as value goes.

India is so fractured among the different states and governments. It might be the country (government) least capable in the world of enforcing a bitcoin ban.

Also, if crypto is the only consideration you have for a president you ought to reevaluate.

I'd argue that a lot of the social ills that have befallen the US are because of a sick, cynical introduction of other cultures and immigrants without considering the social cost of displacing original American citizens, who were a largely homogenous culture up until late in the last century. And the welfare system is one of the greatest generators of poverty, social decay, and moral failing that has ever existed. 
In fact the welfare system was created along with the disgusting for-profit prison system in order to re-enslave blacks and undesirables, and has caused more poverty and moral decay among American citizens than any other program in existence. The moral effect welfare programs served to tear apart the underpinnings of American society even more so than originally planned. All of this stemming from a deeply corrupt, criminal government, controlled by elites, which destroyed the underclasses and native born American citizens. 
It's funny, in all my travels I have never seen another country that wasn't allowed to have its own identity and culture. Just about every other country on earth has a basically homogenous culture and population like America used to have when it was prosperous and beautiful. It would be preposterous to think you could replace native Chinese with immigrants, or that you could replace native born Colombians with foreigners. However, in America you're a bigot to suggest anything but diversity is correct. And people wonder why the US has fallen into its curses of obesity, mass incarceration, opiate addiction, suicides, broken families... In this instance correlation is causation. Immigration, and the displacement of a national identity, has destroyed the country beyond recognition. Add on the perniciousness of government programs and you've effectively destroyed a society. 
Muslims didn't belong in America just like Christians don't belong in Saudi Arabia. Call me a bigot, but if you can't see that America, which once was basically homogenous, has been raped for the benefit of the elites at the top, through uninhibited immigration and the destruction of its national identity than you're willfully blind. And I know this is off topic from my original point about Islam, but if the uninhibited immigration hadn't been allowed in the first place there would be no reason to argue about Islam. Each culture would be in its respectful place. Islam has no place in the west. 
Diversity was a cudgel used by the elites and government to destroy the lower classes and citizens of America. Without a national identity or social cohesion the elites and government can do as they please, using division to keep the lower classes at war against each other, without ever having to face what was once a great, united nation.

Not only that but they wasted trillions on wars that destroyed the Middle East and did nothing for Americans. Politicians in Washington are criminals for the wars perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Sure, but economic definitions don't serve as policy. You can consider crypto to be in the M2 money supply, but the lawmakers and regulatory agencies don't consider that when crafting policy.

Exactly. So you can get an ETF but if the financial markets go to shit you can't count on them servicing your funds. A true store of wealth is something you can access yourself without dealing with some fucking financial adviser/company (crooks) to get your money. 
Bitcoin is better because ONLY YOU control it, you can easily move it around, and you don't have to deal with the criminal finance companies. Fuck having some pegged fund. You might as well just be invested in the stock market if you're going to let some external company control your funds. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:50:14

Sorry I don't give any weight to a fictional character written by a fat loser like George Lucas. 
It's not hatred, but I think their companies should be punished harshly, and I think they should be shunned from bitcoin entirely. These guys caused massive disruption and harm for their own selfish greed. They need to be destroyed and they need to leave the public bitcoin space. 
I actually hate lawsuits, but I think they should be sued to kingdom come, with a gag order to prevent any more of their meddling. Fuck those guys.

They're against a new technology without reasoning then. That's like saying they prefer VCR's so they're not going to get a DVD player.
If you let them dissuade you from something you find compelling, and you miss the early adopter boat, you'll resent them. I wouldn't talk to them about it or let them influence you're decision making. Instead, keep on doing your own research and if you find good reason why crypto isn't great than stop dealing with it.

Well Reddit tends to ban accounts for statements that aren't even that controversial... so you can't count on a main account being available all the time. 
Anyway, I haven't seen spam as much as I've just seen stupid comments. So you're basically saying we should ban stupid comments... it's a bad precedent to mitigate "spam" here because inevitably you'll censor real comments. Fuck your defense of censorship. It's why Reddit fucking sucks now, everything is censored because someone doesn't like what someone else has to say.

Actually I can in this instance because alts are a scam market, for the most part in my mind. Sure, they have value for now. But their mainstream adoption is way far off, and the majority (90%) will fail. 
I invested considerable sums in crypto BECAUSE of bitcoin. So my investment was entirely dependent on my own research. Im not claiming i expected 1000 percent returns, i didnt, but i invested correctly based on my knowledge of the market. Investing in alts, on the whole, is not safe investment.

Well, for one thing, BTC isn't malicious like BCH. The developers of BCH are maliciously attacking BTC. BTC has never actively attacked BCH.
Furthermore, the vast majority of BCH is controlled by its developers. BTC, likewise, has large concentrations of coin in individuals wallets, but those same people don't seem to be intent on manipulating the market like they're doing with BCH. 
I also don't think the price of BCH is an accurate reflection of the market. BTC is disbursed to millions of users, with BCH no one even knows where to buy it. Bitcoin has a more accurate market pricing, BCH doesn't, in my opinion.

It's not a conspiracy. Conspiracies are perpetrated in private with the utmost secrecy. Diversity is a shrieking religion force fed down the throats of every public school child in America. It's a doctrine imprinted on every corporate employee, and a forced facet of every part of media. How does that seem conspiratorial or secretive to you? 
It's a cancer sent from above to destroy national identities. People wonder why china is ascendant, and the answer is self evident. They've retained their culture and haven't allowed the cancer of diversity to destroy them. 
Pardon, I realize I'm so fucking dumb to you. But please answer what good diversity has done for anyone? It's led to the division that's now tearing America apart and only a very certain few are profiting.

Oh I agree it's a major risk factor. I've said from day one government is the single greatest threat to crypto and it's proponents, as you've seen recently with the jailing of localbitcoins vendors.

All the problems you listed could be solved through better exchanges, so you contradict yourself that there's no reason for new exchanges in the market place.

Lol at feminists wanting to completely change history because it inconveniently forgot to include women in the greatest discoveries of the known universe. 
You're not doing yourself or your sex any favors. The greatest women I know realize that women had roles to play, but it was generally as familial support, counsel and advice throughout men's life, social roles, emotional support... and the great women of history loved that role. It's why women have been able to foster greater roles in matters of the heart, art, music, dance. 
In fact, you're denigrating all the pivotal roles women played throughout history because you're jealous of men, when in reality you should just realize that men and women are different, and women had roles to play, but their main contribution was not, and most likely will never be inventions, math, sciences... Instead of trying to upend the entire course of human history, for nothing, why don't you realize that men an women play different roles for a reason?

It's funny that you would mention the aboriginals as an endorsement for your case. If you weren't so blinded by your soulless religion you'd realize they were wiped out by immigration, their cultures forever destroyed. The native Americans were literally exterminated because they couldn't stop hordes of new settlers displacing them. Why should America want this to happen through an uninhibited flow of poor immigrants to replace the increasingly desperate native population??
As far as your internet generation it extends very little into the actual depths of humanity. You're talking maybe a privileged 1% of the global population which exists in a substantive form online. The rest of the world will smother that generation with pure numbers, poverty, and war. 
It's clear you exist in a privileged bubble. I've actually seen the rest of the world and those people are not intent on joining hands and singing peace songs. They either want to destroy the US, replace it with their own, or move there and live without contributing meaningfully to future progress. 
Your future advocates extinction of the country that has enabled the greatest progress in human history, through its unique culture and history,  for the sake of importing the least valuable, least talented people that exist in this world. You're an exterminator worse than hitler or Stalin and you'll smile idly as you murder the future.

I doubt anyone believes that Putin is going to do anything good for crypto that isn't explicitly good for himself and Russia. If he sees it as a benefit, in the whole, he'll allow it to survive. 
Personally I'd rather he keep a football field's distance. Adversaries of the US embracing crypto can only lead to the American war machine and American intelligence agencies destroying crypto for the rest of us. 
The US refers to Russia as a "criminal regime" so their further involvement will only lead to further problems for Americans in crypto. You already see the Feds cracking down hard on some local bitcoins suppliers. 
I've always said the greatest risk to BTC is gov. They don't have to illegalize crypto. They only need to start giving people max sentences in their max security hells and people will lose interest pretty fucking fast.

And sure price-wise a CTS-V is considerably more expensive but they're not worth the premium. I'd sell the CTS-V, if you haven't already depreciated it through your retardation, and buy a better all-around car like the 3-series BMW. If I was spending my parent's hard-earned money, like you, I'd rather have a reliable car with great handling than the wigger's choice "CTS-V".
And you're a fool if you think the CTS-V with its shitty plastic interior, ugly body, and rapid depreciation is on par with the M5. Maybe brand new you could sell one and get a respectable sports car like an M3, but an M5 is way above you or your parents pay grade.

If you had any brain you'd realize turbo diesel powerplants are not used exclusively for trucks (LOL) and actually have a wide range of industrial and military uses. But it really shows where you come from that you'd jump to that conclusion ;)
Also, it's really funny to think about your limp dick attempts at 2xing your money, since your probable total bankroll is for sure less than what I move around for fun in a day. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that I buy and sell more bitcoin in a day than you've transacted in your life. I can tell because you sound like such an ineffectual, frustrated prick... Your type is always the least successful, and ironically the most boastful. 
It sounds like you have a lot of pent up anger and rage at your impotence and general lack of ability. Here's an offer...

If everyone was as weak as you there would be no bitcoin. If you seriously think bitcoin is screwed I'll bet a bitcoin you're wrong... care to put money where your uninformed mouth is? 
There's more awareness and widespread adoption than anytime in the history of bitcoin... Price has a lot of room to appreciate.

Besides the fact that the author is retarded - he spelled "weather" as "whether" - he makes some decent points. 
When big players like China, Jamie Dimon, and multiple establishment media sources start talking about bitcoin it means that more official policy will be coming down the pipeline soon. 
This isn't necessarily bad, but bitcoin is on the radar now.

I've thought of regulations more so as the regulation of rules governing a particular activity, whereas banning ICO's could be arguably comparable to illegalizing passing off gold-colored tungsten bars as gold. 
However, I concede you are correct. This particular event is regulation in the crypto currency space. 
I think it's possible crypto currency could figure this situation out itself without gov. intervention, but I'm not sure how... As a cryptocurrency market/movement we need to figure out a way to prevent shit-coin ICO's from diluting Bitcoin's value.

I don't think Russia could effectively police bitcoin. China hardly can and they completely control the Chinese internet. 
Also, in authoritarian countries something being illegal doesn't necessarily make it unavailable. Oftentimes governments make laws illegalizing something just so they can have leverage over people using it. Bitcoin isn't dead in Russia, give me a frikkin break.

Tulip bulbs can't be peer to peer transferred anywhere in the world in the blink of an eye. Tulips can't facilitate anonymous, yet verifiable trades of large amounts of value. Tulips don't allow for transparency of trade with a blockchain. Tulips aren't confined by a finite number. Tulips can't be speculated on. Tulips have limited lifespans of use. 
And there's actually a lot more reasons the tulip craze has nothing in common with BTC. Honestly comparing the two makes you look dim-witted. Lol

Black people are already attacking and killing whites in South Africa. The overall conditions in SA are black people hating white people, and wanting to kill, rape, brutalize whites. You can see this on social media... its widely available.
You also fail to realize the error of your reasoning, that BLACKS are more likely to be VICTIMS OF CRIME by OTHER BLACKS. There is a diminishingly small amount of white on black crime... it doesn't exist. 
So if blacks in south africa overwhelmingly want to kill and brutalize whites, and there's no response by whites, which there virtually isn't, than you have the makings of white genocide and brutalization. Its getting increasingly worse as blacks increase their hatred, so nothing of what you wrote is correct or even close to reality.

The thing is no one knew what the bottom was. When it crashed to $2900 it looked like it could continue the downward trend. It's impossible to tell the bottom.

Sure there's a lot of retards out there who don't understand what "blockchain" means, but those are the same people who generally don't understand much about business, finance or technology. We don't need those people. 
I'm no expert but I understand the basic ideas behind bitcoin, including the decentralized network of ledgers which facilitates the blockchain. With little technical know-how it's easy to understand the principles. 
Additionally, it is an opinion piece, but WSJ doesn't include articles that aren't thoroughly vetted. As well the article is in their weekend edition which is the most widely dispersed and read of all the editions. WSJ wouldn't put this in the forefront if there weren't anything behind it. 
As far as the "put 10,000 people in a circle and agree on value".... that's roughly what happens with any currency. The dollar wouldn't exist if it weren't for billions of people who simply believe the dollar has value.

This is exactly right. Banks will not use bitcoin for their proprietary, in house transfers. They're intent on using the underlying technology, block chain, in the future to facilitate the movement of their own currencies/units of transfer tied to a sovereign currency, no doubt. 
China is doing this behind the scenes right now to digitize the Renminbi and become the first blockchain facilitated sovereign currency. It fits perfectly within their existing structure of internet control and nationalized technology firms.

The Blockchain Is the Internet of Money By Tunku Varadarajan......
Bal­aji Srini­vasan’s dis­trust of au­thor­ity be­gan as early as first grade, when boys less cere­bral than he was would beat him up at re­cess for read­ing a book. “Lit­er­ally, like, ‘Oh, look at that nerd,’ and they’d go at­tack you.” That was in 1986, in Plain­view, N.Y., an undis­tin­guished Long Is­land ham­let where his par­ents, im­mi­grants from South In­dia, worked as physi­cians. “Be­ing the only brown kid among hun­dreds of peo­ple, lots of kids would gang up on you and call you ‘Gandhi,’ and you could say, ‘It’s not an in­sult,’ and run, but they’d just chase you.”
Mr. Srini­vasan is now 37 and an eye-catch­ing in­no­va­tor in the world of digi­tal cur­rency. “I learned that the first guy who comes at me, I need to hit him—Bam!—with the book, and just act crazy so the other folks don’t jump on you.” Later, at the prin­ci­pal’s of­fice, the as­sailants would have “croc­odile tears” about how the lit­tle In­dian boy had started the fight. “Their par­ents knew the prin­ci­pal,” Mr. Srini­vasan re­calls. “He’d say, ‘Bal­aji, why did you at­tack young Jimmy and Jamie?’ So, I learned early on that you’ve got to stand up for your­self, that the fix is in. . . . The state is against you.”
That ex­pe­ri­ence in­forms his cur­rent work. Mr. Srini­vasan has called the state­less digi­tal cur­rency bit­coin “the most im­por­tant tech­nol­ogy of the decade.” I ask him to ex­plain why, and he says, in fact, that he’s amped up the de­scrip­tion. “I’d up­date that to­day,” he tells me, “to say that the blockchain—which is not just bit­coin—is the most im­por­tant in­ven­tion since the in­ter­net.” My eyes widen, and he says: “Yep. I’m not sure if that’s con­sen­sus among Sil­i­con Val­ley now, but it’s get­ting there.” The “blockchain,” he will ex­plain, is like the in­ter­net of money—with sim­i­lar de­cen­tral­iz­ing and lib­er­at­ing po­ten­tial.
Mr. Srini­vasan, who de­scribes his school years as “com­pletely wasted,” founded his cur­rent com­pany, 21.co, in 2013 with $115 mil­lion in seed money from Sil­i­con Val­ley’s lead­ing ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists. Plain­view is now, mer­ci­fully, out of sight. “Life in the United States starts with a 13-year manda­tory min­i­mum K-12.” Mr. Srini­vasan calls it the “school-ag ar­chipelago,” an awk­ward pun on the Solzhen­it­syn tome about So­viet prison camps. He has a 1-year-old son, whom he will not send to school. In­stead he plans to band to­gether with like-minded par­ents from the tech world and “crowd-fund a tu­tor.”
With his ill-fit­ting sweat­shirt and sweetly in­ex­pert hair­cut, Mr. Srini­vasan doesn’t look much older than a school­boy. One would be in­clined to think of him as a typ­i­cally ar­ro­gant tech-meis­ter were he not so earnest and ami­able. In 2006, im­me­di­ately af­ter earn­ing a doc­tor­ate in elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing at Stan­ford, he co-founded a ge­netic test­ing com­pany, which was “con­ceived in a dorm room.” He was on Pres­i­dent Trump’s short­list to lead the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion be­fore rul­ing him­self out for the job, and he has courted con­tro­versy by call­ing for Sil­i­con Val­ley to “exit” from as much gov­ern­ment con­trol as pos­si­ble. He has, in the past, in­voked the no­tion of the “in­verse Amish,” a so­ci­ety that “lives nearby, peace­fully, in the fu­ture,” where “we can ex­per­i­ment with new tech­nolo­gies with­out caus­ing un­due dis­rup­tion to oth­ers.”
Some of Mr. Srini­vasan’s views were dis­torted in news re­ports, with the now-de­funct Gawker de­scrib­ing him as a “se­ces­sion­ist” (and, for good mea­sure, as “bats— in­sane”). With ev­i­dent dis­taste, he de­scribes the Gawker story as “fake news, avant la let­tre,” and notes: “Last I heard, they’d been sued into bank­ruptcy by prof­it­ing from re­venge porn. Bit­coin is at $4,000, and Gawker is dead.”
Mr. Srini­vasan’s present com­pany en­ables peo­ple to be paid in digi­tal cur­rency for re­ply­ing to emails. It cost me $20 to reach him, payable upon his re­sponse, which was al­most in­stant. We met for lunch at his of­fice ear­lier this week.
“Ini­tially, and in the near fu­ture, 21.co is like a bet­ter ver­sion of LinkedIn In­Mail,” Mr. Srini­vasan says. “Senders at­tach digi­tal cur­rency to mes­sages to pay peo­ple they don’t know to re­ply.” That’s bet­ter than LinkedIn, he sug­gests, “be­cause users are ac­tu­ally paid to re­ply, senders can mass-mes­sage peo­ple, and they can send com­plex sur­veys to peo­ple rather than just sim­ple emails.” The ul­ti­mate goal is to fa­cil­i­tate paid work: “Any­where there’s a phone, there’s a job. You just pick up a phone and what­ever your skills, peo­ple will send you digi­tal-cur­rency-based jobs. You can click but­tons and make money any­where in the world.”
When I ask him to ex­plain the “blockchain,” Mr. Srini­vasan starts to roll with rel­ish. “Short ver­sion? Bit­coin is a way to have pro­grammable scarcity. The blockchain is the data struc­ture that records the trans­fer of scarce ob­jects.” I ask him to re­gard me as a dummy, and to give me the longer ver­sion.
We can un­der­stand bit­coin and blockchain in four steps, he says. “One, cash. When A gives a dol­lar bill to B, he’s trans­fer­ring a phys­i­cal ob­ject. B has it, and A no longer does. There’s im­plicit scarcity in the phys­i­cal world.”
Step 2 sup­poses that we treat the se­r­ial num­bers on those Fed­eral Re­serve bills as “a form of naive digi­tal cash. Then A emails those num­bers to B. Now B has a copy. But A still has a copy!” So if those se­r­ial num­bers were treated as cash, A can “dou­ble-spend” the num­bers by send­ing them to an­other party, C. This, Mr. Srini­vasan says, is the fun­da­men­tal is­sue with digi­tal cash: “the dou­ble-spend prob­lem. How do we in­tro­duce scarcity into the digi­tal sys­tem?”
The way we re­solved this prob­lem be­fore bit­coin, Mr. Srini­vasan ex­plains in his third step, “was through the use of cen­tral­ized in­sti­tu­tions called banks. When­ever you use Pay­Pal or a sim­i­lar tech­nol­ogy to send money from A to B dig­i­tally, the bank is trusted to debit A and credit B.” This, he says, is how “scarcity” is in­tro­duced into a digi­tal sys­tem; but it is “in­el­e­gant, from a com­puter-sci­ence per­spec­tive, to have a cen­tral, trusted node in any net­work­ing topol­ogy”—a word my dic­tio­nary de­fines, in this con­text, as be­ing the way in which con­stituent parts are in­ter­re­lated or arranged.
Mr. Srini­vasan doesn’t care for this arrange­ment: “There are down­sides to im­plic­itly trust­ing banks, as the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis showed.” So rather than re­quire a bank to ap­prove trans­ac­tions, “Bit­coin fig­ured out how to split this power across many dif­fer­ent trans­ac­tion ap­provers, called ‘min­ers.’ ” They “com­pete to ap­prove trans­ac­tions and in­te­grate them into the so-called blockchain. Every time they in­te­grate a new block of trans­ac­tions into the blockchain, they re­ceive a ‘block re­ward’ and are en­ti­tled to print digi­tal cur­rency.” The key point, he says, is that any com­puter could, in the­ory, ap­prove trans­ac­tions, and no sin­gle com­puter could block trans­ac­tions.
Mr. Srini­vasan con­cedes it’s “a big claim” to say the blockchain is the most con­se­quen­tial tech­nol­ogy since the in­ter­net. “The in­ter­net is pro­grammable in­for­ma­tion. The blockchain is pro-grammable scarcity.” He elab­o­rates: “All of these pre­vi­ously dis­parate things—from phys­i­cal mail to tele­vi­sion to mu­sic to movies to tele­phony—ba­si­cally got turned into pack­ets of in­for­ma­tion and got remixed by the in­ter­net. Plus things that we nor­mally didn’t even think of as in­for­ma­tion—your Fit­bit, your steps, your Face­book set­tings—be­came pro-grammable.” It’s fair to say, he con­tin­ues, “that the in­ter­net and all things down-stream—search en­gines, so­cial net­works, ride shar­ing, and so on—have ba­si­cally been the tech­no­log­i­cal story of the last 25 years.”
The blockchain is the next phase, Mr. Srini­vasan says with some zest. “With the blockchain, every­thing that was scarce now be­comes pro­grammable. That means cash, com­modi­ties, cur­ren­cies, stocks, bonds—every­thing in fi­nance is go­ing to be trans­formed, and as­pects of fi­nance baked into every­thing else.” By way of ex­am­ple, Mr. Srini­vasan sug­gests that there could be “a spot mar­ket for the cost of stor­ing one megabyte on 1,000 re­mote com­put­ers.” He then of­fers a slo­gan for the new age: “If you deal with in­for­ma­tion, you need the in­ter­net. If you deal with money, you need to deal with blockchains.” Pretty much every­one, he adds, deals with in­for­ma­tion and money.
The blockchain, Mr. Srini­vasan con­tin­ues, “is a re­li­gion that works.” Here’s why: “If you take 10,000 peo­ple and put them in a cir­cle and they close their eyes hard and say, ‘Let this plane fly,’ it’s not go­ing to fly. But if they close their eyes hard and say, ‘Let this thing have value,’ and they all value it, they’ve sud­denly got a price for it.” They will ex­change things of eco­nomic value among them­selves, and the ex­ter­nal world can in­ter­act with them. “In the same way that once you’ve got enough peo­ple, you’ve got a na­tion, you’ve also got a cur­rency. So, be­lief is ac­tu­ally some­thing you can now ma­te­ri­al­ize into cur­rency.”

If a paper wallet's major drawback is only that it might get destroyed in a "disaster event" that doesn't seem too serious. How often do disaster events happen in the average persons life to where everything is destroyed? A hardware wallet would be susceptible to being destroyed as well by meteorites, flash floods, forest fires.... Anything that would destroy a paperwallet would most likely destroy other types of storage as well. 
Paper wallets aren't perfect but they're up there with the others as far as security as long as you conceal them well. If you're worried about it being destroyed make 2 copies. Put one in the least checked out book in your local library and the other in a safe.

Jamie Dimon's argument is that governments, especially the US, will not allow a competing currency to exist. Like he says, all it takes is the government threatening large exchanges with criminal prosecution. It's illegal in the US to make a competing currency. 
However, at this point bitcoin is not a currency. It was originally set up as one, but now it's become more of a security. It's an asset like gold. Let's hope if legislation is ever passed that it is regulated as a security, and all this nonsense from guys like Jamie Dimon is misplaced because they still understand it as a "currency" when in reality it's not anymore. 
If that happens we could see $100k a BTC.

Exactly. The ICO's in my opinion diminish greatly the value and respectability of bitcoin. BTC and a few other alt-coins is enough for now. ICO's are fucking dumb and worthless.... without value. 
ICO's are terrible for the market so this is kind of a good thing.

He's an investor. That doesn't mean he understands technology. Additionally, he doesn't understand the perspective of little guys and why bitcoin is so important to them. 
In his world banks serve him, in the average person's world banks are a necessary evil. Bitcoin gives people the ability to bypass the bullshit that banks serve on smaller economic footprint individuals. There's no way he could understand this because he can't see that perspective. 
He should stick with investing in blue chip companies. New, revolutionary technology is not his strength.

I agree with that. Just for the sake of our investment and adoption going forward it's more safely named as an asset than a currency.

Typical of a meathead soldier to resort to ad hominem instead of making a logical point. Lifting 315 doesn't make you anymore of a man than any other guy. Being a man is a mindset of prudence, solidarity, inner strength, patience, respect, compassion, kindness, toughness... 
Obviously a relationship is a two way street. I literally said in multiple comments that a woman is invaluable to a relationship and should be the navigator and moral compass that helps guide the relationship through life. 
What profession are you? Are you a cop? You sound like one with your short-sighted reasoning and anger. By the way, I'd kick your ass in real life. Lifting has nothing to do with anything, I'd beat you bloody ��
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:17:07
Well I'm not exactly sure it was just speculation on what the other commenter was saying. But they could put in fake orders to raise the price I imagine... Constant large orders cause the price to go up, so they could falsify those in their internal system. 
I doubt this is happening. It was only conjecture based on a hypothetical question. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:38:02
Lol you're the one implying all those things, not me. I simply said a man should retain final decision making control in a relationship. You're the one saying "men are superior" "if a woman dresses a certain way she's asking for it".

Well, for a lot of people making money is a better high than alcohol or weed, so if the value of Bitcoin continues to appreciate there would be plenty of people willing to hold it for the future gains. 
Additionally, bitcoin is a way of safely storing money without the use of traditional financial instruments, so many people are willing to hold it in order to insulate themselves from financial collapses, government malfeasance, and as a way of transferring value from one place to another with freedom. 
Venezuela banned bitcoin for a while, and it actually increased the usage as people needed it as a safe haven. So yes, government banning BTC would definitely put a damper on it, but there would be a HUGE number of people who would continue using it as a hedge.

I didn't understand his comment. The erroneous punctuation confused me. As far as being sexist I'll accept that label. I use stereotypes and profiling everyday... it's pretty useful. Probably why I've made a lot of money. Because I don't let political correctness get in the way of honest deductions.  
I don't think women are inherently bad at finances. Everyone should be judged on individual merit. I try to treat everyone as an individual. That doesn't mean i can't make generalizations to help myself better understand the world. 
If you'll allow me to be general than I'll go ahead and say the vast majority of investors in crypto are men. I'll also say the vast majority of self-made millionaires are men. Those aren't exclusionary statements either, just simple generalizations. Therefore, on average, it's prudent that a man would make the financial decisions, especially in this case rather than a woman. 
If a woman has a better grasp on finances or crypto than by all means let her take the lead, but I was dealing general advice. So call me a sexist, I accept it. I like it. I enjoy it.

Banks aren't going to use "crypto" currencies. They're going to use the underlying technology, blockchain, to more accurately keep records on existing stores of value. 
A lot of people in the "crypto" space are so blinded by their hate for banks and governments that they can't see it's not crypto currencies that banks want. It's the nearly infallible blockchain/ledger technology that they want to utilize for their own in-house operations, completely independent of anything "crypto".

I don't mind sounding snobbish in this instance. Usually I wouldn't say "retards" but I really mean the people in life who are incorrigibly ignorant, willfully I'll-informed, purposefully stupid who don't want to understand new technology. Those people exist. It's not worth trying to convince those people. 
However, professional people like you listed can nearly all understand, at least, the basic principle of a blockchain being a decentralized ledger which records transactions. It's worth the time explaining and proselytizing to these people. 
So yes I might sound a little bit snobby and elitist, but I don't mind. Other people are snobby about different subjects. Oftentimes people who refuse to learn new things are snobby in a way because "their" old way is better.

I made a post when the China FUD came out about why getting out of China is a good thing for BTC. 
The Chinese authoritarian, shit government perverts everything it touches; real estate, corporations, the internet... we don't want it influencing crypto currency. The best thing for BTC is to stay away from malevolent influences like the shitty Chinese communists. As long as we retain the freedom that Satoshi had in mind with BTC we will see more and more highs, and more and more innovation in the crypto space in general.

Well, when you're life revolves around the immaterial, like social media and texting, you can't ever truly experience the complexity of life. They won't be presented with harsh reality until it kicks them in the face. 
It's almost too bad racism, sexism, classism are verboten subjects because they're some of the only honest topics that exist in our society. People aren't even allowed their prejudices anymore, and that's honestly more sad to me than the prejudice itself.

There's an argument to be made that transaction fees actually increase the cost, and thus the value, of Bitcoin. It's so valuable that it takes money just to move it around. If it were free there wouldn't be any inhibition to moving large amounts all the time, and that could lead to people spamming the system just to make it look like it has higher velocity than it does.
With fees you have to think "do I really need to move this?" and "am I moving this prudently?"

(2nd half of article continued)
I steer our con­ver­sa­tion, here, to­ward China, where the gov­ern­ment has cracked down hard on digi­tal cur­ren­cies, ban­ning cit­i­zens from ex­chang­ing them on­line. Is this the first ma­jor blockchain cri­sis? Mr. Srini­vasan pon­ders the ques­tion be­fore not­ing that “the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is ac­tu­ally run by en­gi­neers. Hu Jin­tao was an en­gi­neer, as is Xi Jin­ping. One of the things they do in China is that they ac­tu­ally give seats in gov­ern­ment to folks who are suc­cess­ful in tech­nol­ogy.”
He tells me—“not nec­es­sar­ily in an ad­mir­ing way”—that there are “prob­a­bly not many peo­ple in the U.S. gov­ern­ment who could ex­plain to you ex­actly what a ‘fire­wall’ is, but that’s a fun­da­men­tal in­stru­ment of pol­icy in China.” Chi­nese politi­cians, he says, are more con­ver­sant with the long-term im­pli­ca­tions of in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy than their Amer­i­can coun­ter­parts.
But what does Chi­na’s crack­down on bit­coin mean? Mr. Srini­vasan be­lieves that Bei­jing is do­ing some­thing sim­i­lar to what it did when it de­ployed the so-called Great Fire­wall in the early 2000s. “It wanted the in­ter­net, but it wanted a con­trolled in­ter­net.” It now has a vig­or­ous and com­pet­i­tive In­ter­net econ­omy, with Al­ibaba, Ten­cent and Baidu, “but it also takes mea­sures that West­ern so­ci­eties would not, in terms of ex­plicit in­ter­net cen­sor­ship.”
If the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment wants the ben­e­fits of the blockchain “with­out the de­cen­tral­iza­tion of bit­coin,” Mr. Srini­vasan says, “we might see a ‘Great Blockchain of China’—per­haps a ‘Chi­na­coin’ is­sued by the Peo­ple’s Bank of China.” It may seem too early for “some­thing of that mag­ni­tude” to hap­pen, Mr. Srini­vasan says, “but some­times the fu­ture hap­pens more quickly than we ex­pect.” An in­ter­est­ing ques­tion, he adds, “is whether this ‘Chi­na­coin’ would just be di­rectly pegged to the ren­minbi, as seems most likely, or whether it would be freely float­ing like bit­coin.”
A more plau­si­ble short-term al­ter­na­tive, in Mr. Srini­vasan’s view, may be that “the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment as­serts its ju­ris­dic­tion over the Chi­nese min­ers who pro­vide most of the world-wide min­ing ca­pac­ity of bit­coin and Ethereum,” the lat­ter an open-source blockchain-based plat­form. Mr. Srini­vasan imag­ines a “cat-and-mouse game would likely en­sue, af­ter which the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment would gain con­trol of a fork of bit­coin and Ethereum chains, but the rest of the world would fork to dif­fer­ent ver­sions of those chains.” The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment could even at­tempt a hos­tile takeover of bit­coin.
Mr. Srini­vasan is con­fi­dent, how­ever, that the pro­to­cols that sus­tain a de­cen­tral­ized, global digi­tal cur­rency will weather a cri­sis of this sort. “This is the kind of test these pro­to­cols were built for. If they sur­vive, which I think they will, then we’ve proven some­thing amaz­ing.” We’ll have proven, he says with a smile, “that there’s now a new kind of digi­tal as­set which even a very tech­ni­cally com­pe­tent and mo­ti­vated gov­ern­ment can­not seize.”

I disagree. It ABSOLUTELY takes skill in purchasing ANYTHING in this world for a lower price. 
Whether stocks, bonds, securities, or Bitcoin there are definitely strategies to purchase at a comparatively good deal.

@_date: 2017-10-21 04:21:51
Yes it could drop. Each time it has I've purchased and made nice gains on individual trades. I don't think the price will remain low on any continual basis, though, without outside government interference or corporate malfeasance. For now the price will continue to be bolstered by a positive feedback loop. There's still billions of people who have yet to join the frenzy, and it only takes a small percentage of those to keep a parabolic, exponential trajectory.

I buy some every day. Why not? It could be a few hundred higher tomorrow. It could be a little lower, too, but if the upward trajectory continues, and there's no reason it shouldn't, you'll be in the money. 
It's really not that big of a risk. The value isn't dropping by any substantial percentage anytime soon, or at least it doesn't seem likely. I doubt you're buying 100 BTC so at worst your looking at price fluctuations of your personal stash in the hundreds of dollars. Not a big deal.

Transactions are a lot easier with BTC than dealing with some asshole bank with asshole employees. If you have to see a bank teller there's a line, wires are carefully scrutinized and often end up with a mistake, transactions over a certain amount take an inordinate amount of time, banks have very limited hours, banks will tell you what you can and cannot do with your money.... The list goes on and on with how shitty banks are.
