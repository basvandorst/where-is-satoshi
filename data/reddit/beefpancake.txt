How old is vertcoin?  Looks interesting
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:27:19
Any suggestions?
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:16:48
I didn't realize TO THE MOOOOOOOOON was a bitcoin thing too.  Only seen it on the dogecoin forums.  Either way, cool signature!
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:20:53
Yeah, I think it's funny that the 'currency of the internet' can only be secured with 100% confidence if the machine is disconnected from the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:18:53
Which ones are best?  I've seen it used in a subway restaurant, and it took a few minutes.  The guy said it was pretty typical ... that was when I decided I'd speculate on crypto-coins, but never use them at POS.  It's nice to hear that I was mistaken.
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:35:41
Yeah, I've invested a little in bitcoin and a little in dogecoin (it's silly, but fun).  I'm thinking of putting a lot in dogecoin, not because it looks like it would overtake bitcoin, but because it has a lot of momentum (it only solves a couple of your listed problems).
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:15:13
This would be a great use for doge, but your comment doesn't really help the discussion.  
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:58:05
Wow, someone sold over 15,000 BTC
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:17:35
This is a good point.  Most people would be willing to tip a couple cents for a good/funny video, but bitcoin is getting to a point where that's not feasible.  This is a perfect example of where dogecoin could work really well, and why dogecoin/bitcoin are not really competitors.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:30:08
No offense, but how is it ever more convenient for a store to accept bitcoin at point of sale?  Doesn't the verification always take 30-60 seconds (or longer), vs. 1-5 seconds for a credit card (or immediate for cash)?
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:25:50
Why is it inflationary?  The supply of DOGE will increase slowly after this year (5% first year, less after that), but this will likely just replace lost DOGE (since many transactions are small, tons of DOGE are lost/abandoned).  It's a great way to keep people interested in mining IMO.
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:21:36
Governments.  It's a lot easier to make bitcoin fail than to ban it.
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:19:05
You can say the same for any coin.  The price for bitcoin would also hit 0 very quick ... something like 60% of all bitcoin have never been used (i.e. mined then held by miner).  All cyrpto-currencies promote hoarding, so prices gyrate wildly on relatively low buy/sell volume (like bitcoin's drop the past couple days).
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:33:12
In dollars, sure, but as a percent, no way.  Bitcoin has very low liquidity (hence why the price skyrocketed last year ... most people hold their bitcoin, so small changes in demand impact the price dramatically).  dogecoin already has had higher transaction volume days than bitcoin because it is used A LOT.  
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:28:59
You don't understand how markets worth.  A $100,000 investment in BTC could cause the value to rise by $100,000 if nobody was willing to sell for under $100,000/BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:01:04
You must not be from the US I take it ... here, over 99% of POS transactions are done instantly over the internet.  No dialup, no typing in amounts, certainly no entering of pins (only debit cards require pins here, and they aren't used that way very often since there are fees), and card receipts are often ignored.  
But I didn't realize bitcoin transactions could be so fast.  Like I said, when I saw it in subway it was awful.  The owner sat there waiting for the confirmation for a LONG time.  Seemed silly for a $5 sub.
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:30:04
DOGE coin is our first step towards a real life Idiocracy.  I love it.
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:18:18
The best form of flattery is imitation
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:04:22
Agreed.  No offense to any bitcoin holders, but I don't see why it would go back up much.  Bitcoin as a currency has fallen considerably over the past year.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:08:49
Does this work in any thread?
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:02:13
Unfortunately, if a criminal sees the bitcoin address they'll likely ask around until they get an answer.  Keeping it in a safe demonstrates that it has value.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:31:39
If I'm sending money to someone else, I'd just use a bank transfer.  Through my bank, it's a $0 fee.  Not sure if this is typical, but almost all banks in the US offer no fees for online billpay (which allow setting up an individual, as well as a business, as a payee).
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:31:44
Oh, I definitely see the advantage of bitcoin to a merchant.  It's basically a merchant's dream come true ... no chargebacks, no limits on what is sold, some level of anonymity, ability to launder/hide money, etc.  I still don't see the advantage from the consumer side though (other than a speculative investment, with commerce being a means of utilizing the proceeds).
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:32:19
As long as you check your statement each month, why is this a problem?  All credit card companies offer fraud insurance.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:02:01
* For  - you could make the same argument about any commodity, right?  People used to say that with Gold.  As long as there is demand for it, prices will rise, but you can't expect that to happen forever.
* For  - isn't there also a much larger chance of them just taking your bitcoin?  Or sending you junk?  With a credit card, the consumer can always be 100% positive that they get what they pay for, or tell the credit card company to handle it.  I purchase a lot of stuff from seemingly sketchy places that I would never purchase if I did not have CC protections.
Your other points are very good though.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:10:09
Ironclad security - what about this whole sheep marketplace thing where over $100,000,000 in BTC were stolen?  Couldn't something similar happen with more reputable transactions?
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:57:13
This is exactly why your average American will not ever use bitcoin (I can't speak for those outside the U.S.).  
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:54:51
Sure, but it would only make a 1% difference in my case.  I can see why others would want it though, particularly those selling inexpensive goods.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:03:40
Cool, I didn't know this existed.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:41:17
Our fees are closer to 1% because of volume (we do millions per year, and they are all high volume transactions).  My wife's fees are closer to 3% (she is a doctor).
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:44:49
In the US at least, you do get taxed.  Money earned in any currency is still counted as income.  You can try to avoid taxes, but the first time you convert BTC to USD, I can almost guarantee you that the US government links your address back to you as a person (unless you are incredibly careful).  
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:03:13
The fraud protection is mainly for the buyer, not the seller.  
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:42:35
I'm not sure what you mean.  I just typed it in and *poof*, gone.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:34:11
If those individuals do not have banks, how would they get bitcoins to begin with?  While many individuals cannot get credit cards, almost all banks provide debit cards to people with bank accounts.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:06:41
From a commerce perspective, I'm not sure how relevant your analogy is.  My company was selling online in 1996, and I was buying stuff on the internet in 1995.  Just because it was in its infancy didn't make commerce any more difficult, and credit cards provided the protection to make any online commerce safe for consumers.  
This is where I see bitcoin lacking.  Just look at all the people who lost money in this sheep marketplace disaster.  I realize that those type of goods couldn't be purchased with a credit card, but fraud like that would never happen for legal transactions via credit card (or if it did, the credit card company would legally be required to cover your loss).
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:55:19
No, it's nothing like that.  If someone steals your credit card number and buys thousands of dollars in junk, you are not liable for it.  You simply call the credit card company, tell them that fraud was committed, and they reverse the charges. 
With bitcoin, someone could steal everything you have in your wallet and you have no way of getting it back.  
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:20:21
When you receive the bitcoin tip, make sure to enter the right address.  I learned that the hard way and accidentally withdrew my BTC tip into someone else's wallet (it was my first wallet)!
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:56:17
Yeah, both of us have average charge per service in the 3-4 figure range, and transaction fees in the 1% range.  From what people are saying here, I actually like the idea of bitcoin for merchants (including for my wife).
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:57:14
What does that have to do with currency stability?  The value of a dollar is almost the same as it has been for years ... there is very little inflation or deflation.  The value of other commodities fluctuate wildly based on market forces though (like oil in your case).
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:18:21
No, because the price of other commodities have risen, wages have risen, etc.  The average of all prices determines inflation ... which has remained extremely low (and consistent) for many many years.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:51:48
My company pays just over 1% in merchant fees to accept credit card.  Over 90% of our business is by credit.  I certainly don't feel like it's corrupt.  And as a consumer, I can confidently buy from anywhere in the world and know that if I don't get what was promised to me, and the merchant doesn't make it right, I just call my credit card company and they charge it back.  No risk purchasing.  That's something bitcoin could never offer, at least currently, right?
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:03:08
2-5 are good points, but I've never paid a fee to a bank.  Mine pays me to use them (albeit, very small ... about 1% on the money I keep in my checking/savings accounts).
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:39:56
Commodities change based on supply/demand.  Currencies do not fluctuate in the same way because the supply can be managed to maintain a target price / exchange ratio.  Comparing the USD to Gold, or oil, or any other commodity isn't valid.  Looking at the economy as a whole, and purchasing power (or or even just price inflation) is more accurate.  
Bitcoin is much more akin to a commodity (such as Gold) than a currency.  It is prone to the same wild swings.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:06:12
Can you explain how it's corrupt?  For 1% of the value of my purchases, I get money almost instantly and gain access to 10X more people (literally) than I would with cash/check based transactions only.
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:54:36
But it could never be as stable as something like the dollar or euro, right? More like the stability if gold (which can still fluctuate 30% or more per year).
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:18:40
I'm actually not even pro-bitcoin.  However, every writer I know is familiar with reddit and leverages it for news.  It is so much easier to grab news from the top daily reddit posts than from any other aggregater.
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:53:04
But the moment you use bitcoin to ship something, don't you use all anonymity? That company can share your address with the government, who can then link you up with your wallet(s) and all prior purchases.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:57:23
How?  If you pay me in bitcoin, I will see your address and full transaction history, right?  A government entity could easily require merchants to secretly report shipping information for each bitcoin purchase, which would link ALL of your bitcoin purchases back to a single person (you).  That's 100% impossible with cash ... businesses don't scan each bill that goes into their drawer.  
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:59:20
Not sure if you'll get a response, but as someone who deals with credit card companies frequently (from a merchant perspective), I can tell you that he's right.  The credit card company would have only covered the charges if it was their database that had been hacked.  This is Target's fault.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:54:56
Yes, it's serious.  Any measure of inflation shows the US Dollar to be incredibly stable.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:42:50
Agreed.  But Gold fluctuates up to 30% per year.  That doesn't sound too stable to me.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:41:36
Serious question - if you are having something shipped to you, how is it much easier?  You still have to fill in the shipping information, right?  And your bitcoin wallet info.  The credit card info is just 3 fields (16 digit  4 digit expiration, and 3 digit CVV).  23 digits.  40 digits for a bitcoin address.  Sure, there are apps to do this all in one click, but the same exist for credit cards, right?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:49:17
But this only works as long as the demand for BTC keeps increasing.  You are treating it as a speculative commodity that happens to be extremely liquid.  You could make the same argument for using eGold, right?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:16:24
If you look at individual commodities, you can follow trends either way.  3 years ago oil and Gold were MORE expensive relative to the dollar than today, but that doesn't mean we're in a deflationary period.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:08:55
Very true ... for purchases from reputable places.  But most online transactions are not from reputable sites (at least for me).  I almost always buy from the cheapest place, rather than always going to walmart, target, newegg, amazon, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:26:44
Not sure if relevant.  Mine is a mid-sized financial and professional services firm.  My wife has a doctor's office.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:53:52
As a speculative play, BTC might make sense.  Maybe I could buy a bunch of bitcoins and make some money.  Who knows.  But other than speculation on it going up, I don't see a lot of advantages for a consumer, particularly vs. a credit card.  I do see some advantages for a merchant now, but those take away many of the consumer protections that credit cards provide.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:55:28
Yeah, our businesses are professional/financial software (accounting industry) and a doctor's office.  Not exactly in the demographic you highlight. :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:01:49
Yes, but that can be tracked, right?  All of that is stored in the blockchain isn't it?
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:37:38
I never said they quoted reddit.  Just that they used reddit as a source of news.  The real source would be whatever article was posted, but reddit would be where they find it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:04:41
I do.  Well, I use CC in USD.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:57:42
I think you are underestimating the power of reddit to drive news/trends.  The flow of information often looks like this:
Something happens -&gt; News article written -&gt; someone posts it to reddit -&gt; thousands of other articles written because journalist saw it on reddit
I'm not saying that thousands of institutional buyers sit around reading reddit, but they read the news, and reddit influences the writers dramatically.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:47:52
This makes a lot of sense.  Both my wife and my businesses are almost 100% on credit card though (just like most US businesses), so I guess I can see why BTC doesn't make sense for us.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:46:04
A currency is NOT an investment, it is a medium of exchange.  A commodity is an investment that can fluctuate wildly in price.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:54:00
No, we're more like an accounting firm.  Most of our clients pay by credit card, but we certainly have no interest in helping the government (which is a huge pain in our side) or banks.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:26:09
Wait, so if a company doesn't send what you purchased, the consumer cannot call the credit card company for help getting their funds back (if the company does not accept a return)?  
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:08:51
So you'd pay extra money for an escrow company rather than just filling out credit card number, expiration date, CVC, and clicking "billing info same as shipping"?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:28:24
This is kind of my persective.  Bitcoin is great for black markets, but credit cards offer so many protections and advantages that I don't see why someone would use it.
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:03:50
Banks don't care if you use bitcoin, just like they don't care if you transfer all of your money out to stocks.  From a business perspective, they are the same.  Banks care that bitcoin is used so heavily for illegal transactions, and they don't want to be implicated in making illegal activities easier (by allowing bitcoins to be bought/sold).
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:05:47
I wasn't aware if bitpay.  That makes it a lot easier. I guess I still don't see the advantage as a consumer though. One of bitpay's big selling points on their site is that there are never any chargebacks. This is great for me as a business owner, but eliminates the protection that credit cards afford consumers.
Holding onto bitcoin will always be a gamble. It's like using gold to pay for things ... every day a mBTC could buy a different amount of product. There's no way it could ever enjoy the stability of a centrally managed currency, right?
