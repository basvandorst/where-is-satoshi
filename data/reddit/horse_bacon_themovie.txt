I wish I had a large lump sum to drop on it at the moment. Only currently dollar cost averaging at the moment...which, in the big picture adds up quickly, I just wish I dropped fuckloads of money into this when I started in '15

all true points. However I would love to get my hands on it so I can convert it into other positions before we get out of Q1.

I sat through all 37 hours of his biography in audiobook format (highly highly highly recommend it). What I've noticed is that a lot of folks here just do not understand Buffet's outlook. Some people get it right but they are missing the big picture on his investing strategy. Actually, I would go even further and say that most people invested in equities/traditional markets don't really get it either. Look, this is the wild west. Had Warren been born ten years later or ten years earlier there is a good chance he would not be the investment mogul we all know. He was in the right place at the right time and managed to make wise decisions that worked in his favor. Its a new world and we will have new Buffet like folks coming through maybe...his perspective works well and it is within his circle of competency, there is nothing about cryptocurrency trading that works within traditional frameworks (yet). Still the wild west.

GAH! I'm tired of waiting on coinbase to distribute forked bitcoin cash over. I'm thinking I might have to try to make the move happen on my own....but I am a bit afraid of fucking it up and losing everything.

"currency" is a weird word with the way its been used. some alts are meant to be peer to peer in the way a person hands another person a single dollar. a lot of other alts set out to solve other issues in very different areas like gaming, banking, IoT, gambling, cloud computing. Its a bit confusing.

**YES** this is the metric I would love to see tracked. Everything else is just speculation. (I am deeply invested in several over several coins btw)

VERY stupid question - word is sometime around January 1 Coinbase will be releasing BCH to owners of BTC. If funds are moved (to say, a hardware wallet) before the distribution I take it no BCH will be handed over?  
edit: nvm. I read the FAQ another time.

ACTUALLY, I just reread what you said about aug 1. Unfortunately my ledger did not arrive by then even though I ordered it well before then. Arrived just after. Oh well, easy come, easy go - I will still look into the BCH thing however.

Interesting fact I just learned yesterday from looking at Coinbase's Crunchbase profile, the NYSE was a series c investor in 2015. I've been turning this fact over in my head trying to make sense of it.  [Series C Investors](

alright, so I am DEEP in the middle of Warren Buffet's biography 'The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life' and pretty much from day 1 he has been incredibly wary of tech and tech stocks. He famously avoided buying into Intel(? I forget if it was intel or IBM or something else) when it was pennies on the dollar. It took him forever to eventually buy into Apple. He is just old school, the guy eats a fucking hamburger and drinks a pepsi everyday and then plays bridge on a computer for chrissakes. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:14:05
yes.

it's going to drop. its going to rise. you have purchased a volatile asset, that is what it does. hold on to your ass once CME futures roll out next month. Who knows what will happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:47:18
you are buying a highly volatile asset. it does this all the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:48:18
its a volatile asset. buy it and do not think about it and never put in a sum that you cannot afford to lose.

what an interesting (rip off) experience. I just purchased some bitcoin via bitcoin atm. It was nerve wracking because I was afraid I would make an irreversible mistake. Not only were the fees high but the exchange rate was at 10k instead of 8.5k or abouts. The atm normally scans phone based QR codes but for some reason my phone would not scan so I instead went with a paper wallet option. I first tried a small amount for the first transaction, once successfully completed I went ahead and completed a second one with more cash. The fees were sky high. 30 bucks to buy 300 USD of BTC! I can't possibly see how the average person would even want to use one of these machines. I normally buy from coinbase but I had some cash on hand and I wanted to learn more about one touch point in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Eh. Yes it has fluctuated a lot and it’s volatile but it has a longer history. I’d rather be down and holding bitcoin than down and holding the newest hyped altcoin
