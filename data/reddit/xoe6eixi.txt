Yeah, awesome currency with a constantly fluctuating value and less anonymity with cash without the protections/guarantees of a bank account.
Stellar concept, there.

But he'll be able to buy tons more that $0.02! 
Then who'll be laughing?!
@_date: 2011-08-09 18:46:32
Not very.

Selling bitcoins at a loss? You *bought* bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-06-22 19:16:52
All hail the free-market.
@_date: 2011-06-20 17:10:08


Ah, the "I know you are but what am I?" gambit. Well-argued.
@_date: 2011-08-03 06:16:31


Gee... when you put libertarian principles into practice it doesn't work? People *aren't* rational? Greed *isn't* the best motivator?
Who the fuck woulda thought?
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:25:03
And people who play with bitcoins have even less common sense, so they're probably ripe for the picking.
@_date: 2011-10-07 19:39:08
Because it's a worthless, overinflated currency that is slowly approaching its true value?
@_date: 2011-06-20 19:03:38
Ah, yes, *assuming* people are rational (also the failure of Libertarianism)
All the people participating in bitcoin at this point are perfectly rational, of course. It's just that, err, something failed

Nothing? Really? Why is this such a big deal if it's *nothing*?
That's a bit dismissive, actually. Maybe you have blinders on?

People aren't acquiring bitcoins because they want to spend it on something.
People are acquiring bitcoins in order to become rich for no work.
People will continue to hoard until their goal is achieved (or the bitcoin experiment finally implodes, which it will).
It's a deflationary concept, no matter how hard you twist your words.

But currency and economics are social phenomena, you can't glibly separate the two.

Context: it's what's for dinner.

Yes, this image confirms it.
Libertarians are deluded idiots.
@_date: 2011-08-05 09:20:11
That sounds like socialism to me!
We like our markets free and unregulated!

So I guess anyone can call themselves a CEO these days, huh
