This is a very comprehensive and informative reply. Thank you very much for the information!
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:40:04
Unfortunately or fortunately, in your opinion?

Assuming that adjusting blocks sizes has to result via fork, does that mean BTC is doomed to stay at 1MB and pray that LNs work as intended? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:13:37
I agree 100%. So then, a question for you (because I haven't the faintest idea how): how can we push for this block size upgrade? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:21:55
And also to you, my friend!

I certainly know who this guy is but I have never seen this video. Thanks for sharing! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:34:34
Very helpful. I appreciate the response.

These kinds of questions go beyond normal tax payers and I would not take any redditor's advice. No offense to the community, but if you follow the wrong advice...well, I'll just say its not worth being wrong.  I would highly suggest seeking out a tax specialist who knows how to handle these things. Otherwise, just report it. Don't be one of those Coinbase users who are now in heaps of trouble over the IRS court order.

Segwit is OK for now but it is like scooping out water of a sinking ship one bucket at a time. LNs cannot come soon enough...if at all. With everyone jumping onboard, the ship is going to sink faster and faster. BTC needs help, and it needed it months ago.

Besides the big 3, I have ARK, XRP, IOTA and NAV. Id say its probably 50% BTC , 10-20% ETH, and the rest is what I just mentioned.

r/explainlikeimfive .... what problem is represented by the can in this scenario? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:38:37
On the contrary, you should be happy with this post. The responses by highly informed and experienced bitcoiners, and especially those running full nodes, has shed excellent insight on why the current form of BTC is the best and why any derivation will never be Bitcoin. That is the point of this subreddit, is it not? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:12:05
Increased volume, mempool congestion, you name it. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:07:42
Sure can, I have done my due diligence. Are you asking these questions because you are interested or because you want to bash the coin? You are certainly entitled to your opinion and it just happens to differ from mine. Time will tell whose opinions were right :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:07:12
I believe it was either Bittrex or Binance. I am too lazy to log in to my accounts and see which one :). You shouldn't be using Bitfinex anyway
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:40:44
We desperately need this post to be  on this subreddit. For BTC's sake, upvote this man!

I make preemptive guesses and set limit orders on Gdax / price alerts on coinbase. You just never know. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:37:25
Another redditor mentioned this and for the life of me I forget who it was, so credit to whoever he/she is, but a pull back is likely because of 2 reasons:
1) 10K is a big mental barrier for people and may indicate a downward trend to a lot of investors.
2) There are quite a few sell orders all over the exchanges. 
Hope this helps.

3.8? Absolutely not. I would strongly advise moving most to a hardware wallet and keep max 20% on an exchange. If you really do not want to go that route then at the very least use Conbase's vault option. 
Also, maybe downplay exactly how much you have. For security reasons. Good Luck!
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:40:17
I think the only advice you need is to put it on a hard wallet, unsubscribe from this sub, and only look at the price every year or so. Or you'll drive yourself insane...trust me. 
Good Luck!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:40:51
Im guessing at 10K it'll trend downward. It is literally impossible to know how far it will fall or IF it will at all. Just my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:39:16
Secure from people? Yes. Secure from Exchanges? No. I'd advise looking up the Vault's functionality via Google or your search engine of choice.
