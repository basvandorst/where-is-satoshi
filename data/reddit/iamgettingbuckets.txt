do you get mad at supercar owners, people with nice suits &amp; shoe collections too? Don’t have a pair of nice glasses around this guy huh
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:05:50
Do you tell supercar owners, people with expensive suits, and shoe collectors that they are wasting their money too ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:49:27
thank you..can't believe it took me this long to fully come to that realization 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:25:29
Let Me Google That For You
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:03:42
Curious how you’re establishing valuation of $3K?
@_date: 2018-09-22 06:41:15
If the shoe fits

Chill out man. Throw a band or 2 in there and have a little balance 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:15:12
remind me in a year
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:14:13
Then it’s not a “real value” in any more of a sense than $100K is a ‘real value’. See ya at the moon
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:38:41
Yes I agree any other direction besides straight up must mean illegal activity
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:23:57
No wait time for CC transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:43:46
They are until they aren't unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:03:01
not buying until $11k if we get there, then next buy would be around $8-9 if it finds its way that low
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:08:45
This response sounds exactly like ‘pure speculation’ 
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:55:46
is the stock market currently in a "breakout"?
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:20:16
That's very likely an ACH transfer as opposed to a wire transfer
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:24:38
Gotcha, I misread your comment
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:07:23
wow this really takes me back
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:50:15
What's to stop you and me from starting an account on their platform and start selling?
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:54:01
fees lower for both buying &amp; selling compared to Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:19:21
keep following up via email. Every 48-72 hours

You're right, and now the price has dropped so you're tempted to sell to cut your losses. if you sell now, you're literally just making the same mistake twice over the course of what, a month or two? just hold it as long as you have any sort of faith whatsoever in what you invested in.
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:18:52
literally nothing to see here
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:27:47
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:03:05
why would fiat want or need to change ? this post makes my head hurt
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:46:06
Now I'm the one trolling since apparently we DO get paid in horse-drawn carriages! Nice. Our financial value is also dependent on how well we drive since, well, that's just the analogy!

I mess around on VirtualPub but at this point mostly just for fun and to see if I can eventually build a legit faucet out of it..who knows. it's chill
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:01:17
segwit2x is weirding ppl out, myself included, I don't see it hitting 5K on this lil tear it's on right now...but once it's sub 4 again just settle cuz it won't last long
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:13:28
good thing we don't live in your little fantasy land.
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:05:27
Yes surely he just needs a few coins in order to transfer his funds to his new exchange where in return he will repay me with his large fortune...I'm in
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:24:09
we're not losing either way. they ban it, price drops, we buy and we keep it movin
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:48:43
Can I buy a meal with a horse-drawn carriage? Is my salary measured in horse drawn carriages? 
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:37:15
