@_date: 2016-08-26 07:20:29
you seem to be informed :D  
I'm just coding a thing. I set a filter and scan the blockchain, then when I find outgoing addresses from this one I also add those to the filters and continue scanning. But: When the spend coins were in the same block I can't get all transactions from the new addresses. I would need to rescan after I did my initial scan, or is there any trick?

I tend to agree. I only read that you need 10,000 whatever coins to get a potion of the next payout, based on "balance / 10,000" (see   
So you need their coins to get new coins? And not for sharing my drive/bandwith? Or don't I get it right?  
But ok: "We are not paying farmers at the current time." - let's wait until they are final.

Can you add an Electrum import:  
    transaction_hash,label,confirmations,value,timestamp
    asdf2134,foobar,181826,+0.001,2013-02-08 19:18  
Very cool would be if you can define +value as income and -value as spending. One difficulty: If you have/import different Electrum CSV or JSON files from different wallets the transaction_hash is the same when you do a transfer between those wallets. (You already have a "Transfer" Button, but it simply deletes those rows?)  
Is there a plan for 2013-2016?  
@_date: 2016-04-01 06:46:06

I've tried so use one and fund a channel. First I needed to fund the lightningd wallet with one onchain transaction. Then I had not enough anymore to fund a channel and noticed, that with the current state of lightning software you need 4 on chain transactions to get in and out. That's rediculous. Is there any real plan to change this? Can I not fund a channel from my well used and backupable wallet?

I still don't get it, why the Total Transaction Fees (in BTC) don't rise with the number of transactions: 
This would implicate that the most transactions (the peaking ones) are all without fees? I am "forced" by electrum to always add a fee. The exchanges also substract the fees.

the address itself cannot get compromised. only the trezor can or your written words on the initial setup. with these "seed" anyone can generate every address, so it absolutely don't matter for security if you split it up or leave it on 1 address.

I once bought 3 LTC for 8$ or so... Not a big fan of it anymore.

Before trolling you should read the article? It's about a 2MB hardfork AND SegWit:


@_date: 2017-03-09 06:54:03
Normally escrow creates a 2of3 multisig address. There you have 3 public and private keys and two of them are needed to spend the money. You can send to any of the 3 public keys. I don't know how they generate the keys without the receivers secret and without you providing an own secret. Normally you own one, the receiver one and the escrow service one. Then you send the coins to that address, wait until you both verify that the service is finished and then you release the funds, send a half signed transaction to the receiver and he can finish this transaction. Or in case something went wrong the escrow service works as a mediator and can send the funds with one of your keys. 
You can take a look at this tool:
It's a little bit complicated but a very basic and solid multisig escrow tool. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:19:11
Would also be cool to use a Trezor and a ledger with the same seed. In that case you double your chance to loose all your coins if one becomes hackable! :D
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:56:23

Imho it's more of a question to whom you will dispose your wealth. To someone you connect through electrum (could be your own server) or to the Czech company behind trezor.
The security is more or less the same secure. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 08:59:48
You can use the same address over and over again. But then it's quite easy to see "what you have there". Look for example at this:   
You see what goes in and out.  
If you use a new address for every transaction it's harder. But as long as you don't spend every months income to 0 you still have change addresses. Those will be reused when you mix up the income for the next month in a new address. There is for example this service that sums up those "wallets" with the change addresses:   
tl;dr: If you don't pay close attention to what you do with privacy it don't really matter. All that matters is: SAVE YOUR WALLET! (backup)
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:37:54
they always lag behind. That's because of the little volume there.
@_date: 2016-06-03 09:16:24
Imho the protocol electrum uses is save from mitm attacks and ssl is only for more anonymity in your network. This even works with a wrong cert. Electrum default connects to a random server and everybody can setup one. So the need for a man in the middle attack is pretty useless. You simply could setup an own node.  
But anyhow that's a thing that should be fixed in the future. Good find.

What about the idea to burn those 750W in a miner? I've looked at antminer, but those beasts eat 2000W and more. Do you know any that is around 500W-1000W?

What happens when there will be more room for more transactions to the actual fee? Where does this fee go to? 
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:56:55
As a miner once I enable segwit fees will go down and I will earn less. Then blocks are filling up again and costing me twice the bandwidth with the same amount of fees like previously. Also my raspberry can't handle twice of the transactions anymore. Under the line it will be good for Bitcoin and so the price may possibly rise in the long term, but as most miners are only calculating their hardware to be useful for maybe 3-6months they may be not see this future and are just heading for the most money in the next month's. And that's with not activating segwit.

The game only accepts moves from the creator or the player that has send the join command and the needed funds. As you can see the sending address that was quite easy, but would be really hard if the game wallet uses different addresses...

@_date: 2017-01-11 11:01:49
I think they are doing something like that. They sell big enough to get all stop loss activated, then this even moves the price more in a down direction and then they automatically rebuy. You regret your Stop-loss and try to rebuy which then drives the price back up again to make them do this thing again. Some whales are just playing with you if you setup stop losses to try to play with them.

@_date: 2016-11-08 15:23:33
Oh, thank you. Too late but nice find.
Yes, it's done on the Testnet, on the main net every move would cost that actual transaction fee. Would make a game pretty expensive. Imho such things would be doable pretty good with the Lightning Network or just let the players do a direct connection. The game was more or less only a proof of concept.

Thank you. Also IE can't handle it. It was more or less just a proof of concept and does not need to work in every browser. I'm also not sure if I want to "finish" it and make it really playable... The current state of the Blockchain with that amount of fees would make it quite expensive to "play" on it.
@_date: 2016-11-08 17:34:59
Funny, that's very similar to mine. I save the moves and new game commands in OP_RETURN. So each move also costs 5-10 cent.
I use a hard coded address to communicate "new game" and "join" aso. where all clients listens to. Then with the new game the 1000 USD are sent to a multisig address and 1 satoshi to a random game address. All moves then happen on that game address. So when you want to replay one game, you just need to scan it's address. That makes the needed data in the op_return smaller and the "flood" of transactions for the players smaller but brought other problems...
Does Ethereum also have those 3 different stages of receiving and requesting transactions? In Bitcoin there are live (inv) transactions, then you can request the mempool and you can watch for incoming blocks.

No, no one can control the multisig address by his own. He needs the other party to also sign transactions from it. In my current implementation there is a 2of3 multisig as a type of escrow. The third person could also be a autonomous agent, like you have in ethereum or with rootstock maybe.
We could also set it up that the winner gets 70% and the losing player still gets 30% back, so he would have a stronger intention to really sign that multisig transaction or just stuck with a full loss. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 09:11:10
Do they offer an official "cryptocurrency research contingent"?
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:51:40
Mine is lacking the endgame and currently locks the funds on a multisig transaction. There was no real way to transmit a half signed multisig transaction between the two players without lacking their identities to each other. Maybe such things work better in Lighting Network?
Also the [webcoin]( bridge must be running. (either locally or mine)
If you want to waste some time and try it and you go to  and click connect, then wait some time it should load all games that happend on

Mine uses multisig addresses and both players engines to verify the moves on the blockchain. This could be called a *smart contract* but isn't fully implemented right now.

@_date: 2016-11-12 10:19:41
In my game, gotoshi I used a local wallet and so a local Bitcoin address as the ID of the user in the public. All moves in my game were done by sending transactions. This made any login system totally obsolete because of the public key encryption. 
You could use this type of identification for the users with combining that they sign everything with their private keys to even code a complete community platform. Every message is signed or the server (if even needed) could ask the user "are you really public key 1abc" and the user can sign that. (similar to bitid) 
No login needed at all!

@_date: 2016-11-08 16:30:52
Well, that was the idea. The *end game* isn't ready implemented. But you bet the amount you want to play and the game sends the satoshis to a multisig transaction with you and your opponent having access to. Then after winning both players would sign that and send the transaction back to the winner. This could also be with a third entity like a autonomous agent making it a *smart contract*.

Out of curiosity: what can you do with LTC that you cant with BTC?
@_date: 2019-08-05 07:44:21
Why should some price adjust to the halvening? The miners are months before aware of that event. What happens after is, they can't sell as many coins as before. But that influences the price only in long term, no secods or minutes frames here beside pure speculation.
Beside that all Shitcoins are just following Bitcoin, Litecoin is (or was) an interesting pilot for Bitcoin. Think of segwit activation which happened way before on LTC. Also Charlie Lee is a fun guy.

But chess can be botted by simple brute forcing all the moves and look what gives you better positions, while that can't be done in GO because of the pure amount of possible moves. You need some kind of AI and that's kinda complicated for a "pocket computer". Look at Googles AlphaGO for example.
But yes, it is a stupid argument. Anyhow as of today it is much easier to bot a chess game then a go game.

You've a fair point. Others here have too. The thing with Bitcoin at the moment: It's gambling.
What you and many others can do: Buy some Bitcoin to gamble on later prices. Then use them as usually once you find a shop and don't think of your buying price. But once you get home again rebuy the amount of Dollar you spend for your shopping spree. That way you don't care about the price of Bitcoin and still use it as a currency AND store of value.

But when the economic value grows, the miners also do, because they level to the new mined coins in form of dollars and the fees. Old miners quit the field and new ones invest in new hardware.

What I don't get. Why should the blocks become smaller or why does this help scaling? It just moves the scriptSig to a second merkle tree. But the softfork still includes it into the Blocks. Only the hardfork then segregates it to a second data storage. BUT: This thing also has to be sent to all nodes, it would reduce the "Blocksize" but not the traffic peaks that are problems why we don't increase the blocksize to 2MB. Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-11-02 13:55:48
No. You have 20 drug BTC and send all to CoinJoin. Someone is watching you.
After everything is joined like crazy next morning you send your remaining 19.8 to Binance.
Binance knows shit. But the guy who was watching your drug coins watches the Blockchain for the next couple of days for 19.8 BTC coming from a join going to an exchange. Then sending a mail to that exchange and send out swat teams to all people sending roundabout that amount minus the join fees to any exchange.
No matter how you mix it, if you still make stupid steps in the end. And that's what people do. Mistakes. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:35:44
Edit 5: should I even bother reporting this to the FBI / police? Will they try to pin me for fraud or something for not reporting buying BTC? (crazy I know but I dont want a double hit here...)
You totally should! Reporting your buys is for the tax stuff, you can also still report it and also the losses and combine it with some other incomes. At least here....

You still can scan the next coming blocks. Imagine you've sent 10 BTC from your favorite darknet market to Coinjoin and on the next day around the same time in the morning your remaining 9,8 BTC to your favorite exchange. How easy would it be to find those?
@_date: 2016-09-23 19:52:03
in op_return you can save 83 bytes for one transaction. Some bytes would go for the index. So lets take 75 bytes of data. Would be 15000 transactions with a fee of 0.0001 each? Would be 1.5 BTC.

Sure there will be a lot of bugs, but I think non of those will leave coins in limbo. Many of the on-chain features use things like nLockTime to send the coins back to the owner if something goes wrong off-chain.
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:36:59
That really is interesting.  
Imagine Alices and Bobs wallets are identified with some blockchain analyzing algorithms. Then this new transaction will look like a normal "one person" spending from one wallet with two addresses. The algorithms will think that both addresses belong to the same wallet and will combine both wallets from Bob and Alice to one big bulk wallet. If it continues with many people or even exchanges you will - in the end - look at one big pool of combined wallets and have no clue who controls which addresses out of it.  
But maybe in the end someone would taint that big wallet as a whole as a "laundering wallet" and it would happen what this article sais about CoinJoin:
\&gt;  Try depositing your post-mixed coins into an exchange, for example, and watch when they lock your account and ask you a lot of questions. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:53:21
It takes your coins and combine them with others to a transaction with 42 times the same output value. Blockchain analyzers can only guess whose are yours. But they see that it was a mixing event.

You also could ask that question what happens after the next halving in 4 years. Or in 8. Imho miners will reduce/stay the same because of better hardware and leverage somewhere where the profit from fees sums up to that loss is coinbase coins.

As far as the block size storage, computation power and bandwith matches it it's fine. But when we now would switch to 8mb blocks, transactions could be free again and an attacker could fill up those 8MB for the same costs as now. But the miners would need to download 8MB instead of 1.

I don't like the way he probably develop this. I would help if it uses lightning network or he helps with the development of this.

How does Alice connect to the Blockchain? Does she have to run a full node? How do fees work here? Do she profit?
What are you doing under the hood? I would do this by creating a 2of2 multisig address and using Alice as a websocket middleman that passes those transaction between two persons. You are probably doing more than this... Any source I can read?

When it's an attack that's a funny solution, if it is possible. But what does minimizing mean? Not sending money from one to another wallet, sure. But when I want to buy something? 
When it's no attack and just a stupid new game or so, it would not point that creator or users of that thing to implement a better solution (like Lightning network for example).

Sounds reasonable when the red thing on the lower right tells us, that this is true if blocks are always as full as now.
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:33:13
Wouldn't increasing blocks just make it cheaper and so easier again to fill up those blocks by an attack again? It would end in the same scenario.
Maybe it isn't an attack but a really stupid implementation or just a stupid thing, like those dice games. I don't blame gaming or gambling but I blame it when it is done by saving an entry to a "forever database" for just 20 cents to win or lose.

It's not gone! Either it gets accepted in some time or you can somehow delete it from your wallet (rescan/reload the old backup or so) and resend it. Watch the transaction on your favorite block Explorer. If it exists and have 0 confirmations just wait.

@_date: 2016-10-18 10:59:27
Oh, I haven't read your name.  
Please correct me, but that's how I understand that [BIP141]( proposal.  


So there are soft and a hard fork variants. The soft fork packs the signatures in the same data structure - "the Block". So what you've said "Witness *does* count in the block size." But with the proposed *hard fork* it would not count to the 1MB block size because it's placed "beside" it with a duplicated merkle tree. (That's the whole reason behind this BIP, isn't it?) Please correct me if I'm wrong! I don't want to be a smartass, I just want to learn how things work in the Blockchain.
What I mean with the op means tx size is: The transactions are the thing that are used to calculates the fees. Not the blocks. And because the signature has to be transmitted it's part of the transaction size. So there will be no "10,000 possible signatures for free".

@_date: 2016-10-18 09:54:24
Not with the hard fork model. The block size would be smaller and there would be another seg block beside it. I think the op means transaction size. That would be the same as before.

Do you leave your pc on over night? When the node runs it will use your upload bandwidth, this maybe disturbes your ping in games. You have to download the 90gb Blockchain and you only help the network if you manage to upload more then you downloaded. Also when you get a new ip all the time the other nodes have a hard work to find you again. Maybe it would be better to host your node online or to buy a raspberry pi that is then running 24/7.
@_date: 2016-10-12 07:36:56
Just watched that video and in the beginning I thought Bitcache is something light lightning network. (you know, everybody jumps in with the same concept and names things different, like Blockchain.Info names it thunder). But now I think more like tje way you said.

You are right, but wouldn't be those amount of users be the best way to solve the chicken - egg problem of how to get enough ipfs and/or lightning nodes online at the same time? 
Build a MU2 client as a downloadable tool. Open a port for ipfs and for LN. Incentive those users with the fees used in both projects. Drag and drop files to this client, encrypt them, save them to ipfs, sell them with LN off chain to others using the web only interface.
Kim just needs to throw in some devs to finish and test those two tools and build a nice looking MU2 on top of it. This is how Bitcoin (and with ipfs the whole Internet) would benefit a lot of it! Then we just need to wait for SegWit to go live and we have the revolutionary thing takes it way to do it's things. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:30:07
You can setup a bitcoin fullnode with a -testnet option. This is a second Blockchain, smaller, faster and just for testing things. There are a lot of faucets for it. And it don't cost you 1$ in mining fees for every test transaction you make.

More or less the same for me. After some years when I started working I bought a car. Then I had the dream of an own apartment (or house). But after seeing some of my m8s buying houses and having problems here and there like forced to move out, bought together and broken relationships and stuff like that. I thought buying is stupid.
I was still HODLING all my money. Then I decided to not invest into "concrete gold" (what we 	ironical call it in Germany, you know. German houses are build of concrete) and invest into my life and my own future. I've quit my job and went back to the University. Had an abroad semester in Australia, finished my [master thesis]( and now work for a Bitcoin company. Best decision in my life I've ever made!
With Bitcoin climbing I sometimes get the same thoughts like after some years of working. Buying something... But I don't own enough Bitcoins to be really worth selling them.
In the end I just enjoy this little roller-coaster and still hope that Bitcoin climbs to $100,000┗(°0°)┛and that it might get me rich. If not what else? Gambling? (Well, that's what we all are doing, isn't it? :D)

Also another issue is: The miners try to pack as many transactions with the highest fee into the limit of 1MB. It's the same problem you would have if you try to pack your backpack with the most expensive stuff you have in your flat. Search for the bin packing algorithm. It's a NP hard problem and takes some time to get calculated. Speaken: Maximizing your mining fee earnings may result in loosing it all because you were lucky and found a block just too fast :) 
@_date: 2015-10-15 09:35:41
I know this is there since some time, but: "Blocks will be stored on disk out of order" + pruning. Does this mean, that I can run a low disk space node and help the network by relaying the latest blocks? Couldn't there also be the possibility to _random_ store old blocks up to "some GB" and relay them to help like I would do with a full node? Same way like a torrent downloader also uploads the parts it already has to help others.

But: What will we have to do when we have the 2.0?  
Assume, we have our old 1.9.8 wallet Files and we have our myTrezor Trezor set up.

Yes. The reward is halved immediately so is their income.

Sorry to say: Forget it. I'm doing this right now for my master in it and it drives me nuts. Writing a real web wallet is nearly impossible. What you can do is use some backend apis. There are plenty and that's pretty easy to do. Maybe if you explain more what you want/need to do its easier to suggest anything. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:24:18
do they payout in BTC too?
@_date: 2016-07-22 19:47:12
You should start working as a product manager at some exchanges. Sounds really well thought-out. I know kraken forced me to renew my 2FA and they have different for login and withdrawal.

It's more likely that they have all the Bitcoins than all the Fiats. Most exchanges learned from the Gox, but I bet less learned how to earn money to pay their support workers.

First of all: I love your service and never had problems with it. I can't think of why you need that much "customer service". You get an upvote from me.
BUT: customer service + be very good at typing fast - reads like: "There is not enough time to get your job done in that time you have. Prepare for 24/7 calling while typing emails at the same time"

He said, he used a paper wallet. And the site explains it prety well:
**Withdrawing Funds**
... Plan on importing your entire balance. Afterwards, discontinue using the paper wallet—as if you were breaking open a piggy bank. If you try to spend or withdraw only a portion of your funds, you risk losing the remaining balance forever.

They are from 
Cheaper then Casascius' Silver coins. But still expensive.
I gifted a Paperwallet and wanted to trade it vs one Casascius, but never seen a cheap one. Maybe i'll trade him a 1/2 or a 0.25 Casascius if i get one :)

Are the fees for a normal transaction really over 1$ now? What you might do is looking at your dust and just take the bigger amounts. And then sweep the smaller, setting a very low fee and wait some days. Never tried what low we can go these days...

There is no way YOU get your Single in the next Month. They have 6000 Chips in the first batch. Then in the 2. they have another 6k Chips. And THEN they get the rest of the 75.000 Chips. Now take your order No and have in mind that a Single has 8 Chips, a Little 4 and a Jalapeno 1. Calculate the rest... But you/we will see if they ship in our "paypal save time"... to others ;)

Take a look at the longtime difficulty: 
I don't think your difficulty curve is right. It will find a plateau (like Jul 11 - first ASIC) when mining with 22nm chips costs more power then making profit. I think, that will happen mid 2014.

3.) If you have one NOW you'll get rich. But if everybody gets one... Calculate yourself. 25 Bitcoins are generated every 10 Minutes. So 3600 a day. BFL has 75.000 Chip's to sell, each with ~6GH/s Power. So the Network will rise to 450TH/s. Now begins the Math: 3600Coins/450,000GH\*60GH\*20USD = 9 USD/Day
Without Power and the Miners from Avalon.

if i unserstand  right, you can "choose" what transactions you add in your block before you start mining it. So YOU can control that your transaction is added in YOUR found block? Now you solo mine with a big box and you can launder your bitcoins that way. (not rally, but for the eyes of a blockchain.info user)
