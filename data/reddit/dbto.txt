Thanks for the help everyone.[Takes off tin foil hat, picks up mflb...]

Thanks for that. I guess that is a little easier. I'm not really a meetup person, so this is a new world for me.

There is also now a bitcoin atm at Bad Decisions

I was sent a copy of an email from the president of MIT sent to all alum (I'm not an alum but was sent by someone assisting with research for a film project).  Anyway, sounds like MIT is standing behind these students, and the students are being represented pro bono by a group of attorneys.

I recently interviewed her for my bitcoin documentary. She is quite intelligent, and provided some good insight for my film. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 19:36:56
Yeah, figured it out.

Not a problem at all!  If you are under 18, I would require an accompanying parent or guardian's approval via a signed release for you to appear in a video.  This project would lend itself to as varied a group as possible.
I also anticipate speaking with some people who want to remain anonymous. If you want to share your views on camera, but want to remain anonymous, that's ok too.  I would still need a signed release (regardless of age), but would light the interview to obscure identity. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:09:49
True to all the comments thus far. But, I did just set up bitcoin acceptance via intuit quickbooks online. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 03:01:40
True, but now it's kind of in everyone's (with an iPhone) hands. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 11:20:37
Same here

I am trying to do my part!  I'm currently in pre-production on a pro-bitcoin film for the general public. I've been speaking with several people for inclusion in the film (experts in their respective fields), and am surprised how little people actually know about bitcoin. The goal of this film is to remedy that. 
Now, to just get my funding in order and begin production!  I'll update here as it progresses. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:38:52
Fair enough.

This is all fine and dandy, but what is stopping your next waiter from using their iPhone to scan your card and complete a transaction in the time between running your card and returning it?  Maybe I'm not getting it.

I'm producing a film to educate the general (skeptic) public on bitcoin. I hope it helps!  Will share updates via reddit, for sure. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:38:52
But that's kind of messed up. Don't think of bitcoin as a currency, think of it as a payment system. The price is in dollars or whatever. Your preferred payment system (cc, money order, check, etc...) just provides the appropriate payment system amount as it relates to currency of choice. 
And to make bitcoin work well in this manner, someone (Coinbase?) should figure out a way for retailers to seamlessly handle returns and refunds via bitcoin. 
So, yes, this still is an imperfect system, but a solution is definitely possible. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 01:26:19
My company signed up. Haven't had any client pay in BTC yet, but haven't had many clients pay lately anyway.  Sad face. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 08:32:06
Aside from BitPay or Coinbase (I'm pretty sure these would work well in most people's opinion), you could just integrate into an existing pos system like this:  
Patron orders drink(s) at bar from bartender. Bartender goes to pos, enters the transaction (customer number or location- can be a unique number for each order, even if same person goes back to bar or same number-doesn't matter).  POS spits out a paper receipt with customer  drink order, total, along with a unique QR code generated from a unique bitcoin public address. Bartender makes drinks and delivers them with the paper receipt.  Patron can pay with cash, leave a cc, or scan the qr code with their bitcoin wallet phone app of choice.  Bartender either (depending on payment method) a) brings back change for cash trans; b) brings back cc slip for patron to sign; or c) looks at POS system which shows the transaction-unique bitcoin address has received the appropriate funds. Done. Bartender can be taking next drink order in between these steps.
Most current pos systems have the bartender enter a customer location or # to start the process anyway. Integrating a bitcoin address generator and payment tracking shouldn't be a huge deal.
If a patron tries to slam their drink and run out without paying, call the bouncer. Not much different than what happens with just cash or cc. Running a tab would be the same, but the customer # would remain for the entire visit, and settled at the end in the same way. 
Of course, with current price volatility of bitcoin I'm not sure id use bitcoin to pay my tab just yet, unless there was incentive to do so (cheaper drinks for bitcoin payments).

I will for sure. PM me your demo/site. Thanks!

2nd coinlock. Heard an interview with the devs and it's a strong idea for digital distribution. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:56:16
Wouldn't/doesn't a retailer just peg the price to the local or prevailing currency?  If something costs $x USD, and is also sold globally for €y and you make a return, you get the same value back. If $ loses ground to € between purchase and return, you still get the same amount you paid in the currency of your choice. Bitcoin would have to work a little different- but pegging the value to 1 currency: if you pay .5btc for something with a value of $250, and return it a week later, you would get $250 back (in bitcoin). You wouldn't necessarily get back .5 BTC, you would get refunded $250 worth of bitcoin. 
Sorry for the bad description. Working on phone and doing too many other things. Apologies for incoherence.

Also, to be honest, I am trying to get funding for this project, and Cathy was local for me so it was logistically an easier interview to conduct.

A true sign acceptance is right around the corner...Molly pressies with the logo stamp. Classic. Although, word if warning, I'd lock myself outta my phone wallet if I was gonna roll with that. I could easily turn into happy-tellingeveryoneaboutbitcoinbytippingtoomich-guy.

They could also resort to returns getting gift card/store credit only. They could also start their own altcoin for returns/coupons/BestBuy rewards club points.

Good to know. I own a small audio and video production company. I'm considering accepting bitcoin, and it's nice to know there is potentially a way for me to spend our bitcoin on productions (by hiring you to voice a project for bitcoin).  Way to go!

I'm just guessing here, but I think maybe this was made based on the fact that the original saying (which may or may not be attributable to Ghandi) has been used here and other Bitcoin forums to describe the way the world banking/political system has been interacting with Bitcoin.

I remember hearing Coinbase declined to work with the legal cannabis industry due to federal banking regs...same reason banks aren't touching it. I agree that Bitcoin (or Potcoin) seem like a natural fit. And I also know the dispensaries don't need to use Coinbase to conduct business with Bitcoin, but it is (was?) one of the easier for merchants to implement and cash out to pay employees, suppliers, etc...  Now when employees and suppliers start dealing in Bitcoin, then thins could get (more) interesting.

Yeah, that kind if thing is frustrating. Not my original intention. I guess having a few drinks and thinking about it, I just wanted to give away some bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:42:58
I wasn't really going to do anything at all, but then I just was "feelin' it."
Why do a I have the feeling that you will now be trying all my post content for hidden bitcoin addresses?
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:07:23
That is so cool. Reminds me of the stories I've heard of my grandmother going on treasure hunts in the 1940's and 50's, sponsored by soap companies and such. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:48:00
If course- that makes perfect sense. I mean, how secure could "tHe qwic brauN fx djumpdoVur the lesi dAWg" actually be? But, as a means of hiding in plain site bitcoin rewards for people to find is kind of a fun idea for a treasure hunt. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:16:53
That number I believe. 
 But "~ 1047" was read by me as "roughly/about one thousand forty-seven."  Am I misunderstanding the way it was written?

@_date: 2013-12-18 03:13:53
Someone cracked my code!  That was silly and kind of fun. Congrats to whomever claimed the coin!  
Maybe I'll try this again...once I have some more coin to spare. 
Edit- oh, and noob that I am mistakenly sent the same amount twice to the "secret code address". Oh well. Live and learn. It's not like 2 bitcoin is worth THAT much more than 1.  I totally understand this stuff!
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:48:18
That's the one. It's empty now... Someone cracked my stellar code and transferred the bitcoin (2 transactions totaling about $1.00USD)
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:38:37
Just me being goofy. I used the "?que? Wood i..." String to generate a brain wallet. Added some small amount of coin. Like I said, I'm not a smart man. I just found the idea fascinating. The idea that people could do something like this is pretty cool. I could see a bitcoin Barron doing this as a way to put coin out there for the less fortunate to find. I mean, you could whisper a phrase to random people on the street. Most would think you are a nut or a perv, but eventually, someone would get it and claim the coin. Could even develop into a sort of "hobo code" for the 3rd world(if that's still a politically correct term).
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:15:26
Well, that makes a LOT more sense. Thanks for clearing that up. Couldn't tell if a joke or I gravely misunderstood the proliferation of bitcoin addresses. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:01:20
Forgive my ignorance, but aren't there a LOT more private key possibilities?  Maybe I misunderstand?
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:21:24

Hah, can't believe I missed that...ACCEPTING.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:26:40
But why would I do something like that?
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:48:19
Boy, I wish I was smarter. Sometimes I feel like you are directly addressing me (maybe speaking about my reddit history or subscribed subreddits?) but I am not clever enough to decipher. I hope someone figures it out. This will haunt me when the value of bitcoin hits $40k USD, as some have speculated. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:43:12
Weird. Maybe I'm doing something wrong (entirely likely).  When I checked it, it had the deposit I made, then I checked again later and the coin was gone. 
I have some time today to try and see what I'm doing. I'll let you know when I find my mistake or understand what happened. 
EDIT:  Sorry- the string of text I used to generate the brain wallet was "I mean-?que? Wood i dUe sumpThng lik dat? Gx57$pG7!?", which results in the bitcoin address:  1JTWqEuQXRrkfAka1LT9Lmgrt2ntLGY24T
That shows my 2 (mistakenly duplicate) deposits and a single withdraw.
