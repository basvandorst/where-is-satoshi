Venezuelan here. Sabotage argument is non sensical at least conspiratorial at best. I can attest that Chavez’s socialist-robin hood type vision was put in practice and made him gain a massive popularity only because of all the subsidies he gave to the poor but at the expense of the country’s economy and ultimately wreckage. You can’t just take and never put back...

1) You do know conversions from decimal to binary notation exist.
2) If info points to a link it’s useless as link is not immutable. 
Parable points out that patterns can be found in anything if you look long enough.

Just forgot to add the energy it takes to run every single bank office in the world, all atms in the world, money spent paying employees, factories to mint coins and paper money, also banker’s pay-check. Forgot to mention that btc is only the first layer and that for it to become global you need more layers on top like the Lighting Network. His research was poor or is behind an agenda.

Comparing bitcoin to visa is disingenuous. Why didn’t he add every single bank office in the world, every atm in the world, every bank employee’s carbon footprint, how about factories that mint coins, and make paper money, credit cards... How about the carbon footprint of banker’s ferraris and yates. 
Bitcoin promotes the race to find renewable energy resources that one day will secure the world’s first global currency. How is that too expensive?

Funny i sent some out of the box gpus to mine in Venezuela and they were decommissioned by the local custom authorities. Take into account that we haven’t been able to exchange bolivares to dollars for years. Country is a joke.

Not everyone wants to be a day trader... also paying attention to bitcoin prices very closely is life consuming. So we HODL

Sounds like bs. He was “handed” (a paper wallet i suppose) some bitcoin by a stranger? Without even knowing how it worked you exchange a piece of paper for 50 dollars back in 2009? Hmm

In the whitepaper the authors refer themselves as "we". And in all honesty it looks like a group effort. Also maybe part of the plan to stay anonymous

This is so true. The more i study blockchains to less I think this “web 4.0” (that Ethereum sells) will ever be a thing

To withdraw to a bank account? From what I know they don’t charge fees to trade but to withdraw it’s done through Coinbase. (I think)

More abstractly speaking borders maintain form. Too strong and they impede learning from the outside world, too little and system falls into chaos.

The way I see it, Bitcoin is a preventive tool against financial crises not a corrective one which the author wants to fit into. Financial crises happen because certain measures are exploited wrongfully. In theory these loop holes wouldn’t exist if you didn’t have a central authority making these mistakes in the first place.
