So insignificant that it's the responsible for the longest lasting time of peace in Europe for over 2,000 years.

It’s not illogical to be fair. Existing investors will always need to re-enter had they already tethered and should drive the price up to near 19K again (14K is probably near enough). This should happen with most market cycles and would only then increase the price if/when new money does start to pour in.

No problem! I’m +1 for logic and reasoning. 
Money can cloud judgement at times. I generally have a positive outlook towards Bitcoin in the long run but try to keep an unbiased mind when looking at the current situation.
My main gripe is with technical analysis. I’m pretty sure it’s confirmation bias applied to pure luck, but some people swear by it.

I hope you've used a passphrase (25th word) stored using a password manager as well. That way they'd need both your decrypted 25th word and your physical seed. Make sure the 25th word is at least 20 characters with symbols and alphanumeric. I'd recommend using password-store [ for this.
One without the other would be useless. 
You could also load a small percentage onto just the 24 word seed wallet for plausible deniability.

You’re missing the fact that selling pressure is reduced after a halving. This is because the amount of $$$ to maintain the current emission and sell off from miners goes further once the halving takes place. Ergo, it should have an additional effect.

I remember seeing his posts and, despite knowing it was a baseless prophecy, would have hated it if he’d been correct.

There's a decent video by Andreas Antonopoulos about this. I'd suggest going to watch it if you're serious about this question.

Just a minor correction. It won't cut supply, it'll cut emission (inflation). The supply of bitcoin will still increase, but at a much lesser rate than before.   
Sorry if that seems pedantic!

In the same way that the attempted solutions of “The Seven Bridges of Königsberg” problem is important to regular people.
Just because regular persons don’t know about a solution to a problem that is used behind the scenes, doesn’t mean that they can’t utilise the benefits of said solution

No exchanges use bitcoin.
No payment processors use bitcoin.
No chain analysis uses bitcoin.
Microsoft isn’t using bitcoin 
All you’ve done is verify your argument as being false.

You're thinking of communism. Socialism opposes wage slavery and empowers the workers of a means of production. True definition Socialism actually works well with anarchy and libertarianism. I'd recommend reading up more to see if you're more aligned than you realise!

The seven bridges problem didn’t solve anything at the time. It was pure mathematics and not applied.
In case you’re not in touch with academia, I’ll explain.
Traditionally there has been two major fields of mathematics. Pure and applied.
Pure is basically math for maths sake. Problems like “the seven bridges” have solutions attempted. The solve a problem for their own sake. “Wow” as you sarcastically put it.
Applied math then takes the findings from pure math and applies it to real world problems. This can sometimes take centuries before it happens.
My dissertation tutor once told me that the biggest insult to a pure mathematician was when his research became applied. I’m not sure of the validity of his claim, but I have no reason to doubt it. 
Sometimes in a math, a solution solves its own problem before it’s fully applied use can be realised.

People use fine art because the value is subjective and there is 0 fubgibiity. They use "appraisers" and deemed it to be worth x amount.
Bitcoin has actual markets, with decent liqudity, that operate and Bitcoin itself is very fungible, thus one can't just assign their own value to it.

You've missed the point.
Solutions to Byzantine generals problem allows for shared databases, that aren't centrally owned, to be kept in synchronisation as according to the ruleset defined. This solution provides the benefit of database structures commonly known as the blockchain, for which digital currencies are most frequent consumers of. It also allows for the use of smart contract platforms in which the mutable state is shared across multiple discrete network participants.
There are also untold benefits to the solution that have yet to been realized. Such as google was to the 18th century mathematician.

 No one is telling you what to be excited for. 
You’re free to pick and choose what you want to invest in, as are other people. That’s the fortunate thing about living in a western country.
Some people will fight for that freedom in the form they see fit. Otherwise will build to help improve those freedoms with each other.
Otherwise will just sit online and troll people because they’re angry. They’re free to do so.

Exchanges, chain analysis, payment processors, hardware manufacturers, development agencies, AWS implementations, IBM implementations, Microsoft implementations, research papers, conferences.
There's probably way more and my list is no where near exhaustive.

Libertarianism is spread across the entire spectrum. You can have right and left forms of anarchy/libertarianism.
That being said, Bitcoin is for anyone and can be used by anyone. The more vocal supporters typically tend to be the libertarian type groups but there's plenty of other people who aren't as such.
I personally believe that ultimately there will be a single global currency in the world, and Bitcoin is a pretty decent currency system to facilitate that.

I was just mainly presenting a counter estimate to the original estimation presented. My estimate would require belief that the world’s monetary mediums would be replaced with bitcoin, I’m not 100% convinced this would be the case.
Hurling insults of “moon boy” isn’t really offensive to me, if anything it looks foolish to yourself when you’ve taken a thought experiment debate as “hope”.
The agenda being pushed today is quite clear, as well as is your intention of not prompting intellectual discussion, but by a form of weak school boy bullying because you yourself can’t comprehend the discussion taking place. 
I worry for your existence in this world.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:16:39
So, by your estimation, 0.5% of every single human on earth has stopped using the mediums you listed in order for it’s current magnitude. 35 million? 
I think your estimation is slightly under, maybe $10-$100 million per BTC is more accurate
