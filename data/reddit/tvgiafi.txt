 A little bit too much in hindsight :(
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:24:25
Yes. Anything else is bullshit/criminal.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:20:58
Thank you for speaking the truh. This is complete bullshit, they're a bunch of criminals trying to weasle their way out of this, while completely fucking over part of their users.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:06:44
You realize a lot of people lost a lot of their money here, right? And all bitfinex has done so far to address this is having their PR rep give misleading answers on reddit for three days. And then you write a comment reply like that? What exactly is wrong with you?
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:06:50
At least I'm not one of the assholes who lost other people's money and are now trying to weasle their way out of their responsibility while fucking over their customers.
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:04:25
The 36% number is very suspicious. It's just about the maximum that you would reasonably expect most people to begrudgingly settle for. Where does this number come from? How do we know it represents their real deficit? Is any external party involved in this to verify that they're not just making shit up?
@_date: 2016-08-20 11:46:11
But which is better, Wimblebimble or Shufflepuff?
@_date: 2016-08-08 07:41:27
It's part of teamspeak.
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:16:04


And is there any external independent party involved in this process to verify that Bitfinex isn't just making up their numbers as they go? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:18:47
For real. This shit is starting to get really old.
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:19:31
Fuck! Exactly the kind of sleazy guy who doesn't give a shit about doing the right thing and only cares about money. Goddammit. I might spend my last few bitcoins to meet this guy in person...
@_date: 2016-08-08 07:40:34

Why the hell would I convert anything to ETwhatever?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:48:46
He definitely understands how to make himself look like the poor guy who's just a victim of this situation, getting sympathy for himself and for Bitfinex by proxy. And it seems to be working too. Fuck that! Your company likely just ruined my life, I dont care if you don't get your nine hours of sleep right now!
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:26:36
Fuck you and your misleading answers! Of course users will get money back, just none of the 60 million you lost! Fucking wanker just stfu already!
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:39:20
All the insurance promises are just marketing lies. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:16:25
Not among all users, only among bitcoin holders and some usd lenders. Meaning the losses will still be extremely high, maybe over 70% per user. It's the worst of all solutions and completely fucks over all bitcoin holders and usd lenders on their site, while it was Bitfinex that royally fucked up. Bullshit.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:26:58
Isn't that expected if they can't pay for the lost funds and have to go into bankruptcy?

That's when I finally had enough of reading his bullshit replies.
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:00:06
Exactly! Where does the 36% come from exactly?
Is there any way to verify that the 36% actually represets the real value of their deficit? For all we know, their real deficit could be something like 20%, and they are going to pocket the difference. Easy money.
And is there any independent oversight of this process? Or can they present us with whatever fabricated numbers and call that 'transparency'?
@_date: 2015-12-19 00:05:45
It's actually a birdseye view of a wizard casting a spell.
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:17:37

It would still be nice to have the choice though.

Looks like I'm definitely not going to update my node anytime soon. First the RBF bullcrap and now this.
@_date: 2015-12-25 02:01:46
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:53:48
It's lengthy, yes. But it doesn't make a convincing argument as to why "chain transactions" should be ignored. And as others have pointed out already, every bitcoin transaction is at the end of a (usually very long) chain of transactions. The only exception to this are mining rewards. Chains of transactions is how bitcoin fucking works. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:55:33
But.. but... those friendly miners promised to keep my information safe on the blockchain, just like that. Incentives shmincentives!

@_date: 2016-03-04 23:33:31
That's what she said.
@_date: 2016-01-30 13:12:20
It would be enough if people would stop spamming with useless transactions. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 12:37:13
Whatever. 1MB is enough for anyone!
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:30:22
Exactly. Peter Todd has probably been attempting this for a while already for this little publicity stunt. Everyone knows that double spends are possible if you try hard enough and get lucky, so not sure what point he's trying to make here.
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:18:05
Well, none of them have ever reached over 1 billion in price money.
@_date: 2016-01-17 03:26:22
Yes, the public/private key pair is perfectly valid, which means it can be used to sign a message. But the bitcoins can't be spent due to a quirk in the software (which could have been avoided).
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:18:45
Thanks :(
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:21:39
Nice. Users like warning messages when dealing with money. Thank you Peter Todd!
@_date: 2016-01-30 01:46:20
I think the priority thing got removed in the latest Core version.
@_date: 2016-01-30 12:42:21
Yes, better start doing that right now. Bitcoin growth and adoption can wait. Thanks for the foresight, core devs! Short sighted big blockers have no clue. They can go use something else that's cheap enough for them for all I care.
@_date: 2016-01-11 04:47:03
My wallet has never set a fee that got my transaction stuck. Stop creating problems that don't exist to justify an unnecessary "solution".
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:51:27
Aww, did you learn a new thing from wikipedia? How cute.
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:38:15
Yes, all transactions are dust and spam! Except mine of course. And maybe Greg Maxwell's. The rest can fuck off!
@_date: 2016-01-07 11:40:39
Ha Ha!

Then they will do that exactly once.
@_date: 2016-01-12 08:10:10
It's not like your dogecoins would still be worth much.
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:22:11
Oh my god, I'm in preschool again!
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:28:56
If you like low fees so much, why don't you go use dogecoin or something? We here at will happily outbid each other for the privilege of using bitcoin and pay higher fees. Bitcoin masterrace! Fee market fuck yeah!
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:13:58
I'm not even a noob and I barely understand what the negative confirmations is supposed to represent. It's bad UX caused by an unnecessary feature, pushed by people who think this is a better way to approach full blocks than increasing the block size.
@_date: 2016-01-22 13:19:54
You could try it. Just make another backup of the current wallet before you restore an old one.
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:52:56
Meh, it worked just fine with a 1MB limit for years now, and fees are not even at an ATH. I don't see why this would change anytime soon. Blocks are not full, they're only like 90% full, so we got a lot of reserves. And most transactions are not even that important, just people using bitcoin because it's so cheap to use now. We don't need them. Good riddance!
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:39:48
So what? At least bitcoin will only be high value or something. It makes it exclusive, people like exclusive expensive things. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:06:53
user: lets use paypal instead.
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:33:01
But why stop there? Why not raise it to $2? More money for miners!
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:38:30
Bullshit. All modern wallets handle fees for the user now.
@_date: 2016-01-30 13:37:12
Lol no, not my transactions are spam. Other people's transactions are spam! But once the fee market is here this will finally end. Damn hobos spamming my blockchain...
@_date: 2016-01-09 02:18:43
It's not just 1mb, it's 1mb every ten minutes.. that's like a hundred floppy disks each day! ain't nobody got room for that!
@_date: 2016-01-11 04:54:46
Seems like that was due to a bug in fee calculation. Bugs in wallets happen. And opt-in RBF makes bugs even more likely by forcing more complexity on wallet developers.
@_date: 2016-01-26 02:23:14
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:34:40

Core is going to get replaced by freedom of choice. There's your RBF!
@_date: 2016-01-12 06:35:41
Yeah whatever
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:19:48
You're not supposed to fork Bitcoin unless the fork has already been successful. Otherwise you're nothing but an altcoin with no consensus and no support! No, that's not a stupid chicken and egg situation at all, it's just how things are, mkay?
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:24:47
It's evidently the depth of your understanding of my argument. But that's okay, everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:26:49
It's their own fault for not knowing how RBF works. Stupid noobs deserve to lose their bitcoins. At least they won't spam the blockchain with their economically worthless transactions any longer.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:08:30
I don't know why this makes me laugh so much, but it does :)
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:01:43
It is what it is.
@_date: 2016-01-09 02:05:17

@_date: 2016-01-13 02:28:24
Me too! It was instantaneous and completely free. Didn't even have to do anything. Thanks Obama!
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:48:12
Exactly! If every hobo could use bitcoin as money, then people obviously want nothing to do with it. Who wants to use hobo money? The less people can use it the better. Make bitcoin the Ferrari of currencies!
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:45:31
I think his point is that fees are not at an ATH, which means that we need to make sure that fees increase by a lot soon. We need a new ATH!
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:24:37
No, it makes bitcoin more fun to try and explain to non-technical people. Oh how much fun it will be to explain the implications of opt in RBF to them. Thanks, Core devs!
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:10:32
No, dogecoin chose to start a new altchain, they didn't intend to fork the bitcoin blockchain in a new version of bitcoin. Your mental gymnastics with the terminology are amusing though :)
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:28:30
Cool beans. We should raise fees to $1 right now!
@_date: 2016-01-12 08:10:24
@_date: 2016-01-30 12:26:48
It's not just my opinion, it's the opinion of the experts. I look forward to outbidding all of your transactions :P
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:22:43
That doesn't look like a confusing bug to users at all. Thanks, Greg!
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:04:12
Then why don't I have the doge equivalent of my bitcoins on the doge chain? Oh right, because it's an actual altcoin and wasn't a fork of the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-11 05:13:50
How old are you?
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:25:09
Hey if fees go up even more that would generate even more miner fees!
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:26:01
Yeah that was actually their point.

@_date: 2016-06-21 00:37:02


Link please? AFAIK there was no documentation other than the code, and their website even advertised it like that.
@_date: 2016-06-25 09:44:28
That's a cop out. People will go buy the things that he positively mentions in his speeches again and again, regardless of any disclaimer he might add to it. If he wants to learn about new things that's fine, but don't drag your audience in with you. He's a pumper that acts like he's not. The worst kind in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:42:55
They can always go beg for a fork.
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:57:27
Yes, it's written in form of the DAO code.
@_date: 2016-06-25 09:37:04
He doesn't do enough critical evaluation of a hyped up thing before joining in on the hype. If you listened to him, you lost money. He was also pumping dogecoin back in the day. Just saying.
@_date: 2016-06-25 23:39:48

Why would I answer a nonsensical question like that? Do you not understand the simple point I'm trying to make here, or what is your problem?
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:02:04
How do we know what was the intended result, if the code is the only documentation in this case? Why should your interpretation of the intention of the code, or Vitalik Buterin's interpretation of the code be any more valid than the hacker's interpretation? Either the code is the law or it isn't.

Nobody cares. If they want to sell their bitcoins, let them.
@_date: 2016-02-03 00:50:25
because bits are confusing.
@_date: 2016-02-08 01:19:16
Looks like ageneric wordpress template. Does it at least have some groundbreaking features that would justify the years of development and the thousands of bitcoins it cost?
@_date: 2016-09-14 00:17:40
The solution to this problem is obvious: we need new laws that prohibit people from withdrawing too much (or any) of their money as cash. Or why not make cash illegal while we're at it? You know, to fight terrorism and crime and child porn of course... no other reason.
@_date: 2016-09-14 00:21:56
I'm not even going there because I already know it will be flooded by altcoin shills. This is why we can't have nice things.

None of this addresses the problem that the stake in PoS is intrinsic to the system you're staking. That's like saying "I bet you this shiny rock that the rock is gold"... you don't lose anything if the rock turns out  to be just a stupid rock after all.
@_date: 2016-10-06 17:13:42
Last time I tried it I couldn't earn bitcoins with it yet. Does it have that option now?

The guy who runs the biggest bank in the Philippines? Aka their CEO? The CEO of a big bank opens accounts and personally checks on people? Hmmm...
@_date: 2016-10-01 11:44:48
I don't think you understand the implications: with PoW you need to make an investment that's extrinsic to the system in order to attempt an attack. With PoS that is not the case, and to attack the system, you only need to be part of the system.
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:04:29
I was kinda joking...
@_date: 2015-11-27 09:07:25

Love your reply to this. The users aren't going to learn how to code and make a better bitcoin, they will simply either not use it, or use something else. Makku7's comment shows a staggering amount of ignorance and ivory tower thinking.
@_date: 2015-11-04 08:39:25
I agree. Thr majority of all these transactions doesn't need to be confirmed in the next 10 minutes, and those that do can raise their fees.
@_date: 2015-11-20 10:18:57

Unfortunately not. There are some proposals for this, but none of them have reached critical mass of implementation yet.
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:47:40
Yeah, very unsatisfying answer. This is really getting a bit concerning when the motives here aren't very clear, and this patch is pretty much forced on everyone despite all these concerns :(
@_date: 2015-11-29 09:23:06
It's easy for casual uses to not be aware of what exactly RBF is and what it means for 0-conf transactions. Scammers can now easily take advantage of these users by sending via RBF opt-in and double spending that transaction. It's absolutely unreasonable to expect everyone to understand how this whole opt-in RBF thing works and what the implications and risks of it are. Heck, half of the people in this thread don't even understand it fully!
The only way to deal with this mess is for wallets to display huge warning messages when someone sends an RBFable transaction, which is scaring those same casual users more than anything else. Who wants to use bitcoin when you have to rely on these warning messages to not get scammed? It's a usability nightmare.
Alternatively wallets could simply not show the incoming RBFable transaction until it is confirmed. But this will lead to even more confusion, as now people will wonder whether the money has actually been sent or not. Again, a usability nightmare.
And all of this for what exactly? RBF is great, don't get me wrong! But there is a first-seen-safe version of RBF available that already allows fee bumping, and that doesn't come with any of these problems: it has no effect on 0-conf transactions, so it doesn't need all this stupid opt-in confusion, and it doesn't need wallets to display huge warning messages with every transaction. Why not use that instead of creating this mess with opt-in full RBF that nobody really wants or needs?

Aren't you the greenaddress guy who would also benefit from killing zero conf? How convenient.

Please stop with the fake edits now, Gavin might actually believe they're real!

Maybe a good opportunity to give Firefox a try; it has come a long way on Android. It even supports addons like noscript and ublock.
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:56:17
Cool, now it will also be easier to hide while it's easier to double spend. Peter Todd is really thinking this one through :)

But she also never opened a bank account just by installing an app.

Then he could just have said that. Looks like he wasn't clever enough to come up with that excuse. He should have waited for this JVP dude to suggest it to him.
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:39:35
Sounds like Romania.
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:02:14
This. Is not even RBF.
@_date: 2016-05-04 06:10:59
Is he trolling us??

Why does Mycelium not connect directly to nodes as well?
@_date: 2015-11-24 00:30:55
Let's call it Blockchain. That will mess with some heads.
@_date: 2015-10-30 05:59:25
It's actually 546 satoshis, also known as the dust limit.
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:42:56
This JVP guy sounds like a huge ass. Not unlike Craig.
@_date: 2015-11-28 08:54:18
If I don't want to support RBF on my node, is there an alternative to Core I can run that doesn't have this?
@_date: 2016-10-14 10:46:16
Is there a MW implementation yet? Is it being worked on?
@_date: 2016-05-05 23:43:31
Sounds gnarly.

Good guys F2Pool!

Maybe Bozo the Clown was the real genius here.. a genius at making people laugh.
@_date: 2015-10-30 07:01:54
Oh, it appears you are correct. I wasn't aware that the dust limit is a consequence of the minrelaytxfee, which got increased in 0.11.1. TIL.
@_date: 2015-10-31 01:52:23
But I can send you 2701 satoshis, which is exactly 1 satoshi more. And what does this have to do with deflation?
@_date: 2015-11-28 23:22:54
Not many people were even aware of that. Also shows how little actual demand for this feature exists right now, which makes full RBF even less justifiable in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:05:07
RBF is a clumsy, bad workaround for problem that needs to be fixed.
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:00:35
Almost everyone here arguing in favor of this patch turns out to be someone who has something to gain from killing 0-conf transactions. Amazing.
@_date: 2016-10-29 23:43:02
Mycelium is working on their own implementation of coinjoin afaik.
@_date: 2015-11-20 10:17:54
Where can I vote yes on that?

Instead if screaming FUD, could you maybe address the issues and concerns laid out in that article?

Crowdsale? Ethereum? No thanks!
@_date: 2016-07-20 18:11:08
Adding more shitcoins is obviously way more important than answering stupid customer emails.
@_date: 2016-07-27 18:46:28
It is however a potential business strategy to take advantage of the lack of other scaling measures. Blockstream is a business after all, right?
@_date: 2016-07-27 17:10:18
Uhm, if confirmation times for transactions with a reasonable fee become too high, then users would either be forced to pay high fees for the privilege of hopefully getting a timely confirmation, or wait a long and uncertain amount of time while hoping for a confirmation, or use a trusted cosigner so the recipient can accept the transaction before it confirms.
It really is pretty obvious how one affects the other here.
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:12:46
Isn't greenaddress all about whitelisting zero conf transactions? Like they act as a "trusted" cosigner for every transaction, so the recipient can accept it without having to wait for confirmation, as long as they trust greenaddress not to participate in double spends? Is this business model the motivation for the acquisition by blockstream? 
The obvious problem with that is that if this kind of whitelisting by a trusted cosigner becomes commonplace, then it would mean all these transactions are now essentially controlled by a central party, in this case greenaddress/blockstream. Not good for privacy, and definitely not good for fungibility.
@_date: 2016-07-27 23:42:53
Oh okay, so the problem here seems to be a slightly disambigous wording. Yeah, let's now completely focus on this and ignore all other concerns, because clearly all these concerns are invalid because of the word "other".
@_date: 2016-07-27 17:14:19
Read my other reply. Believe me when I say that feigning ignorance here does not help alleviate my concerns, at all.
@_date: 2016-07-27 19:07:21
What really ticks me off is smart people acting like they don't understand what you're talking about, and then trying to distract you by steering the discussion away from the issue by going on about technicalities that completely miss the point. So yes, I would indeed like to have my point acknowledged and addressed.
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:10:05
Probably depends on whether that site is on their blacklist or not. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 22:02:50
Nobody said it's a scaling solution. Why would anyone think that? It's a way to abuse and take advantage of the lack of scaling solutions. Are you all stupid or just acting like complete clowns?
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:33:11


I just hope this "signing as a service" is not planned in lieu of other scaling measures. You know, the conspiracy angle to all this is just as obvious: don't scale on chain, force users into 3rd party dependance, then make sure to acquire said 3rd parties.
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:45:13
You sound exactly like someone who would buy ether coins.
@_date: 2016-07-27 17:34:07
Of course it's not, that was my whole point. It is however a potential business strategy to take advantage of the lack of other scaling measures. It's not that hard to understand, is it?
