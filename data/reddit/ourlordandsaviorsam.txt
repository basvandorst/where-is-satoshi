It's the University of Idaho

I'm not sure he was saying it's doomed for failure as much as just that it's not nearly as large and developed as core

He pulled from a couple different crypto websites I had never heard of, nothing too major, but they also seemed pretty unbiased
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:14:23
No, I don't think so. It was just a normal class lecture that happened to be about BTC

Yeah, EIA.gov says we have the 5th lowest electricity costs in the US

It's the Internet, I still want to keep some bit of anonymity

Yeah I'm not sure I agree with him on that part either, but I figured a lot of this sub might

Nah I know what you mean haha, just emphasizing that this isn't some liberal arts college in the middle of the prairie with like 30 students or something

He's keeping a tight grip on it because if he sends you wallet.dat and you find the password, you get access to all $130,000 in the wallet

Also, for your edit 3, their changelog on github says that 2.4.1 came out on 7/31/15, so you should still be good for the 2.x mpk

Thanks for the heads up. I've updated all the instances for just lowercase a-z. I'm sticking with btcr just because I already have it all set up. Looking at 173 years worst case right now. Fingers crossed

Sorry about that, I meant to help you when I got home from work last night but I forgot. I'll write something up for you when I get home tonight

I have btcrecover trying to bruteforce everything between 7 and 12 lowercase letters and numbers. It's running across a number of virtual servers (and my own computer), for a total of 257 CPUs and roughly 240 GB of RAM. That's trying a total of 17,462,000 passwords per second. That being said, with all the possibilities, it could take up to 8600 years at this pace. Hopefully it gets lucky and finds it before then, but I don't think it's super likely. I'll still leave it running for a while though

In the same way that selling eyeglasses in the United States is illegal unless you're a licensed eyecare provider and the customer has a prescription. Just that something is regulated doesn't mean it's banned.

IIRC before version 2.8ish, Electrum didn't use full wallet encryption. You only needed the password to be able to send funds, just about everything else was available as long as you had the wallet file.

Right, but if (heaven forbid) Bitcoin crashes and doesn't recover for the next 18 years, OP just gambled away the kid's college tuition. Better safe than sorry when it's providing for your family's wellbeing

That's a clickbaity article if I've ever seen one. They're just saying that the exchanges have 6 months to start checking identities to prevent money laundering, which is likely to occur in the US in the near future too. They're not banning it, they're just regulating it in favor of (inter)national security.

Sorry but I'm gonna have to throw in the towel on this one. I've burned through $300 of server time with Google and found that it's not lowercase a-z with 7 or 8 characters. Ruling out 9 characters would be another $300 for me, and 10 characters would end up costing me $8000, which is a heck of a price for a $7500 reward. I don't think I'm gonna be able to find it, especially with this moving target that now might be up to 16 characters, might have a couple numbers, and might have specific words. I hope you find it though
