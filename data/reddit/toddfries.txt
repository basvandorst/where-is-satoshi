Turns out it is much more simpler than that.  It is explained in the faq about how funds normally marked `reserved' in a bank account are simply just taken and returned when they are no longer `reserved'.

True to bitcoin form, you can rapidly attempt and get phone notifications 1s later that it was declined due to insufficient funds, xfer some btc, and click submit as soon as the funds confirm for the score.  The only way I can get funds between banks faster is to withdraw cash and deposit it in the other bank, but by that time a btc confirmation will have occurred because no two banks of mine are within the same driving time as the average time to confirm a transaction 3x ...

I am not a tax person, but in my own accounting, I would simply consider this the same as if I'd xfered the BTC to circle and then sold the BTC into my bank account and used the visa debit card off the bank account.  Obviously not quite as convenient, but for doing the tax implications dance, it makes it pretty simple to me.

If you're familiar with UNIX .. then OpenBSD can work as a desktop just fine. I've been doing so for 1.5 decades ..
If you're fine without decent flash support, and other software that is binary only produced for other free unix os'en, you'll be able to do what you normally do.
By the way, 'checkout source' 'make build' and the whole world is rebuilt from the tree, no funky modularization and chasing compiler optimizations per cpu variant.  How other os'en support such wild rides I'll never know!

So I take it you never use coinbase, bitpay, or bitcoin exchanges and all your bitcoin is and always has been stored in your personal wallet and you only seek out via openbazzar the exchange of fiat and bitcoin?
Come on, there are tons of venture captalists pouring tons of money into bitcoin to create .. middlemen ..
So, if a bank decides to keep clients, they need only to decide to offer a middlemen service that competes with an existing startup.
I'm not convinced they are going to invent their own coin but consider a bank of bitcoin where you keep a few bitcoin and setup automated bill pay and have a debit card that doesn't come from another country and perhaps you want to get a bitcoin loan from someplace that doesn't have btcjam "jacked high" interest or they reinvent the bank vault into a bitcoin vault of sorts.
Just off the top of my head I see all sorts of traditional banking roles that might be offered to people in a bitcoin friendly economy as noted above.  I'm sure there are others.
Whats the saying about 'lead, follow, or get out of the way' ??  Banks have a choice in the future about which they'd like to do ..

I've used audacity (gui) and sox (cli) to muck with audio files, generate .mp3 and .ogg files for podcasts and the like before.  Not sure what you mean by 'pro audio production' but with the  and  subsystem, audio and midi are rather nicely multiplexed without the complexity in the kernel.  I would be curious if you give it a go what (if any) feature(s) you find lacking.  It definately does more than I've ever needed or fully understood ;-)

I'd be curious how github.com/conformal/btcd would run on a Raspberry Pi.  I have a full node on a kvm running btcd in 512mb of mem, so its easily doable ;-)
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:06:50
Another thought I have is .. instead of funding nodes 'just to help the bitcoin network' perhaps someone could create a project that sets up nodes to be shared by wallet only software .. btcwallet from conformal can be run in a small footprint just needs btcd to talk to in order to get to the block chain and such.  Until they implement the ability to have non admin users authenticate, there is a trust factor that others sharing the btcd are not going to shut it down etc. Not that it would effect the security of the wallet, but anyway. It would be nice if we could share bitcoin nodes and make use of them rather than just running bitcoin nodes to .. have more bitcoin nodes..

The one thing this math does not take into account is the fact that some people may be investing fiat to make bitcoin to payoff fiat loans or whatever.  If I spend $500 to get a bitcoin miner that generates coins (diminishing amounts of course) and the price per bitcoin skyrockets to $3k USD per bitcoin, doesn't this mean the payoff is a different calculation than if you purely used the BTC invested vs the BTC payout?  BTC value changes with time vs fiat, so .. if one is planning to use ones mined BTC for fiat ends, and one invested fiat to get a BTC miner, .. and BTC goes up in price .. doesn't this make the calculations a bit less clear?
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:53:17
Turns out you don't need to convert to fiat if you have bills you can pay in BTC.  Sofar my hosting is all paid in BTC and I'm eyeing online merchants whenever we go to shop for something online, more and more merchants are available via BTC.  Now if anybody shows me how I can get a walmart gift card for BTC I'd say 50% of our food budget would be held in BTC until we needed to go shopping.  It was a sad day last year when Walmart closed the doors on 3rd party merchants to sell gift cards (hi gyft.com, egifter.com!)  I wish Aldi's had a gift card system.

If you love beating up your disk and managing different ports to listen on for either bitcoin core or btcd .. sure go for it.
Ultimately, you might use one to bootstrap the other (i.e. force btcd to slurp off your locak bitcoin core daemon to import the block chain) until you decide btcd is cool enough to shut down bitcoin core after exporting your private keys from bitcoin core and importing them to your btcwallet instance(s).  That's what I did a long time ago.
It's like asking "should I run postfix and sendmail on the same server?"  .. they both provide the same service, and ultimately it can be done, but its much easier to have one service implementation running on one machine at a time.

The devs are being cautious.

@_date: 2014-03-02 15:34:13
Oh come on, you missed my favorite feature of btcd:
* btcd stores only the block chain 
* btcwallet is a separate process
* therefore you can have a lightweight btcwallet on your phone or other mobile device or in hard to find locations (accessable over tor, communicates to btcd over tor if configured) and have one btcd for a group of btcwallets instead of one blockchain per wallet like bitcoind
Maybe its just me, but bitcoind's 16gb (and growing) disk and 512mb mem per wallet is a bit much. btcwallet's  82k disk and 8M mem for a wallet seems rather reasonable and quite like the name implies.
I want a wallet not a kitchen sink!

Uh, look again.
# go get github.com/conformal/btcwallet

Yes there is a separation between block chain daemon vs the wallet daemon and that is a good thing.  I can run btcd on a 512mb kvm vps and btcwallet (ideally on a different system) only takes a few mb of memory and a few mb of disk.  Easy to run multiple wallets and a single block chain daemon this way.

Try an exchange that takes paypal .. e.g. virwox.com .. then you can paypal -&gt; virwox USD -&gt; virwox SLL -&gt; virwox BTC .. although you might wish to do your first xfer of BTC out without a pressing need as it can delay up to 48h the first time, instant after that.

Just a random thought, has anyone compared existing financial exchanges regulations and requirements in NY to this proposal?  Has anyone compared existing companies voluntary disclosure practices to this proposal?  I hear a lot of negative, but I also see a lot of parallel between voluntary disclosure and mandating in the proposal.  Perhaps timing and thoroughness are not the same but ... given there is room for public comment and shaping these proposals better, essentially asking for help writing them, I'm sure there will be ample feedback with good reasoning to change anything blatantly stifling into a good first step at regulations.... Note I said ample feedback .. hopefully the feedback will be utilized to its fullest .. ;-)

"I can't wait for the day when it is easy for my users to acquire Bitcoin."
Perhaps I'm nieve, but I signed up with virwox.com, added funds with my paypal account (could be done with credit card or other means) for USD (could add funds for other fiat currencies).  Then I sold my USD for SLL and SLL for BTC and sent my BTC out.  Consider the fees if you consider this route, but in the end, it is a quick way to get BTC.  One big disclaimer though, the first xfer out of virwox.com via BTC has a delay of up to 48h 'for review'.  After that its much faster ;-)

As a long time user of btcwallet and btcd this is welcome news.  Hats off to all the hard work and dedication.  Also thanks for hand-holding a few of my misunderstandings about bitcoin.  Glad I could provide feedback and useful corner case testing ;-)
Personally, 100% of my bitcoin not in service providers wallets (coinbase, btc-e, etc) is in conformal's btcwallet on my OpenBSD systems on encrypted partitions backed up with conformal's cyphertite.com product.
As mentioned in another thread asking for donations for full bitcoin nodes, instead of 2gb mem for the bitcoin core client, one can get a 512mb kvm with 500gb storage from buyvm for $12.50/mo (must pay for 6mo at a time, can pay in btc) that runs conformal's btcd just fine.  This way I don't have to beat up my local disk and I can focus on what really matters, i.e. running btcwallet in a secured environment on comodity hardware!
Yes I know this might sound like a bit of advertisement, but on the flip side, I believe giving enough details to understand how I roll ought to be useful since it seems useful to highlight one major difference of btcd/btcwallet vs bitcoin core .. i.e. separate blockchain storage vs wallet daemon .. and what one can ultimately do with it today ;-)

I like your suggestion, and while that is awesome and a "killer app" in its own right, I consider the instant transfer of funds to be the "killer app" for me.

Hmm, so consider that in the far future, given we all convert to bitcoin or similar, archive.org or similar will have a blockchain per past currency as a way of preserving known usages of said currencies.  Gaps will be present, and a new blockchain rendered upon unearthing of past archaic accounting records to make a more complete picture.  Students will datamine past currencies for examples of how, without a public blockchain, shady operations were able to shuffle funds to and fro without public knowledge.  Would be quite entertaining to research the federal reserve 'addresses' in such a 'historical' blokchain in such a future ;-)

Oh and, fwiw.  I also own an AntMiner S1 that has since last year been on only when extra thermal properties are desirable in the room of choice it occupies.  Translation: My son who is 10 months old benifited from a cozy warm room this winter due to the AntMiner S1.  Sure, it was minting bitcoin at a loss in terms of recovering the electrical usage.  But it was giving me more of a profit than a space heater of a higher wattage that only produced heat. ;-)
@_date: 2015-09-21 19:30:04
The thing that you are missing is that mining is like predictable luck.  Let me illustrate with my own hardware.  I have 3 AntMiner S3's.  If I were to mine solo on each one independently, luck is predictable in that after a few years I might mine a single block between them.  However, if I tell them to join a mining pool (AntPool, p2pool, you can look up others) then the pool's total hashpower dictates how often it gets lucky and mints a new bitcoin block.  Most pools worth joining get a new bitcoin block every few days to every hour or so, depending on their hashpower.  So you get a piece of a bitcoin block more regularly.  Due to the way the math on luck in the bitcoin sphere works, you'll seriously get the same amount (roughly, averaged out) regardless of the pool you join.  Now if a pool is unreliable, has network outages, etc, you'll want to find a more reliable and less latency between you and the pool scenario, but that's just your personal choice details.  How frequently does a pool get a block minted should rougly equal how your payout gets divided out.  For 3 AntMiner S3's I own which tally roughly 900GH .. I get roughly 0.01btc per day.  If you have cheap (or paid for electricity like in some apartments) you can still get an antminer S5 and consider the math and get your money back in a few months, and turn a profit after that.  Please do your research and understand that your hardware cannot fail, your electric cannot go up in price, BTC cannot go down in price, BTC cannot half, difficulty cannot go up, or your math needs redone.  Minting bitcoin at home is indeed rolling the dice in terms of profit vs loss.  Large scale operations can invest lots of money and have more of a profit margin in volume.  Hope that helps explain in a different way what is going on in the mining landscape ;-)
