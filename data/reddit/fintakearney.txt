It’s all speculative. Definitely gambling.

47 kids? F
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:19:21
Concise. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:37:10
Agreed. Too much power in one place for decentralised tech.
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:31:07
Not now.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:59:10
Spot on!
@_date: 2018-05-16 17:36:46
Care to elaborate? probably not.
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:23:58
Get the W3C to spec a draft.
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:26:16
Constructive debate.
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:13:16
A blocker explorer would be good with smart sub domain logic so people would simply have to enter  to see transaction info.

The end is nigh
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:58:52
And when you want to sell it? LocalBtcoins is at a premium and you have to meet a complete stranger. The moon boys won't want to sell of course :)
@_date: 2019-08-17 11:26:35
Well said. Thanks for the comment!
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:50:21
This made me laugh, thanks for the giggle
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:01:50
Yeah if we can find a higher low it could be bullish.......or it could not...
@_date: 2018-06-01 07:51:52
Hehe I bet that’s no even half of what they had :D

He wasn’t making a prediction guys. He has many other videos exploring why he thinks it may go higher. He is looking at things from both perspectives as a good investor should :)
@_date: 2019-08-29 23:52:06
Best of luck. Hold that shit for ten years or till retirement. Lock it away somewhere that even when you’re broke you can’t access.
@_date: 2019-10-01 11:20:20
Well said!
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:09:31
Thank you. A good excuse to learn more about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:56:33
**Don't leave your Bitcoin on anybody's exchange. Send those coins to a NEW address, one for which YOU control the Private Key.**
That doesnt make a difference. There's a transaction leading straight to the new address. Which now becomes part of their records for later transactions reconciliation.
**"Nope. That's not my address. I donated those coins to a Druid so he can sacrifice some grasshoppers on my behalf during a full moon. That's HIS address"**
And when they know who your sending it to? My point is that you might have to anwser questions like that in the first place.
@_date: 2019-10-30 23:25:15
Start small imo. Let your investment prove its worth to you. We all work hard for our money.
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:00:18
I hope LN brings more privacy to the network.
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:13:17
Well said! He certainly had a lack of understanding when it comes to Bitcoin vs Shitcoins. He refused to acknowledge any issues with government inflation and dilution of national currencies.
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:40:30
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:33:13
I have yet to have someone explain how I could have transferred it for cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:12:50
Thanks for the giggle :)

It was from Coinbase to my hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:34:28
I like the focus on user experience. 
If the W3C defined a meta tag working draft for different crypto wallets so that websites could accept donations that would be great. Browser plugins that manage user's wallets could streamline website donations.
Browser vendors have already begun to incorporate the integration of payments via cryptocurrency approaches. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:03:47
Is that with Segwit? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:39:24
Coinbase

Constructive dialogue

You are completely right. An individual will be able to develop a decentralised application that can’t be taken down and will continue to propogate on any nodes that are put up. The viruses however will need to target the same types of exploits as a centralised application which in some ways doesn’t make it any more dangerous.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:35:48
If you are being optimistic about the app working and notifying you when it should then... YES!!
@_date: 2019-09-30 22:47:00
That’s a lot of questions let me try and break them down.
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:13:51
If you have a BTC wallet and they have a BTC wallet, just send it to their wallet address. 
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:13:55
I’m confused
@_date: 2019-09-01 10:46:38
Lightning network has big security issues at the moment according to Microsoft. Hopefully these can be resolved. It’s a failed project at the moment it seems like.
Edit: Not reported by Microsoft but from the lightning network mailing list.
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:38:12
Fair enough. I was just using this as an example. Stay safe guys!
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:33:28
Not affiliated with that site. People can use anything similar. Although I would prefer to use my own running node as it’s a bit more secure but not everyone has the time to download and synch everything.
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:50:54
As many of the upcoming comments will state. You will need to do some more research. Next time add money to your currency wallet and use GDAX to place a buy order with no fees.
@_date: 2019-09-01 11:49:57
My bad. I was misinformed. The security issues exist but we’re not reported by Microsoft.
