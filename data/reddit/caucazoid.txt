So how much do you miss The Daily Hash Rate?
@_date: 2016-04-25 10:22:49
Watch the site when it's close to 1000 
@_date: 2016-04-24 23:07:42
That way you know it's legit.
@_date: 2016-04-21 04:37:58
I know, that's why it's so genius.
Also it will add legitimacy to graphics. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:46:07
and then someone hocks a loogie next to him.
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:09:23
This sub is censored, has been for years.
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:44:47
What? You don't like Liquid?
@_date: 2018-10-15 01:07:53
It was supposed to be a brain fart.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:50:48
I'm not too sure Bitcoin will be in it for the long haul.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:22:12
Also doesn't hung on timing. You're probably going to die sleeping you know.
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:58:10
What? Nooooooo.......
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:51:14
How butch.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:05:30
I'm on McAfee's Law
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:03:09
As a store of value or currency?
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:33:58
Yeah, who'd think the backbone of the network that pays for electricity would want to get money for their efforts.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:32:10
You should stay diversified. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:02:18
We all know Bitcoin will get to 5k. If you buy in now and it goes to $5500 and suddenly drops back down to 4k. Congrats you're in Bitcoin. Wait until it starts going back up to 5k and people will think you're a genius for owning one. 
5k is a milestone that Bitcoin will hover at for a bit so if you buy knowing you might not see this kind of action until it moves towards 10k then buy a coin or 2 but don't do it if you're in debt or have to get in to debt to buy in.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:54:16
At least he tried to get black people on board.
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:54:39
Not yet. Why? Need me for something?
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:46:32
Wow, I like money. I can't believe you like money too! 
@_date: 2018-10-15 01:15:37
What can I say? I saw the light and found Jesus.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:08:20
Welcome! Careful with u/theymos he wants the Rothschilds to control Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:37:45
Nah, you need to rebuild the system. Just go back to the constitution and go from there. This town needs an enema!
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:25:40
Seems to me this wouldn't have been a post in the last dip. Why now?
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:34:23
Isn't that what ethereum is?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:39:39
Actually ford wanted the cars to run on hemp alcohol. Imagine what a nice world we would have lived in if we would have stuck to his vision.
Probably wouldn't be in the middle east right now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:22:24
Doesn't look removed to me!
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:39:07
Of course they are and even when BTC hits a million they'll still be saying the same shit.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:57:42
Yeah, funny how is cool about all the censorship around here.
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:13:32
yeah but I know way more people who don't own any BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:08:19
I mean in the whole world like you have 1 in a 6,000,000 chance of owning a whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:19:20
I don't know, she's kinda hot:
Also, she's buying Bitcoin so that's some hot idealism and you know her dad is probably hording gold.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:00:24
There wasn't an all time high image on bitcoinity?
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:38:39
Buy a hardware wallet if you're serious (and you should be)
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:59:16
Good question!
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:03:32
Keep the Bitcoin up his ass.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:02:13
We should take over the country. A bunch of us go and make a network of trade and pay using bitcoin. Eventually Bitcoin would rule.
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:59:29
I thought Aug 1 was the day to squirt?
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:28:53
Yeah, but I've seen crypto people saying the same thing about cryptos and compared to fiat crypto and silver are a steal at any price.
@_date: 2017-06-22 01:31:37
What's wrong with being diversified?
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:42:32
I always knew there be a day when talk would switch from the 21 club to lower amounts 
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:20:56
Big time
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:28:06
Play the field, get a Asian girl, a Black girl, Euro girl. Are you married to her? No.
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:25:08
I gave my mom some and she immediately lost it all in satsoshi circle.
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:28:58
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:52:36
I'd rather stay diversified thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:42:01
I didn't say I won't HODL.
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:14:11
Harder to get 1 BTC. I'd take the BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:00:12
I took 1 bitcoin and turned it in to a bunch of Litecoin, Eth, Dash and Ripple. Now I just sit back and wait. No more exchanging.
@_date: 2017-06-18 06:37:48
Won't be long
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:36:12
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:44:28
