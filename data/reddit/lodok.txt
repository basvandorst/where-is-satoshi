You got my upvote

You could say the same about fiat and stock. I know scores of people who lost more than half of their decades long 401k contributions after 2008.

Sheesh, the down votes here.

I know this is old, but I think it's more than just a biased US media.  I feel like critical thought on the internet is becoming a needle in a haystack.
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:26:45
I agree with you.  Which is why I was saying that they conflate those things in a subtle manner.

I've relied on Mother Jones for information in the past as pretty reliable journalism.
That said, these pieces from Kevin Drum lately are just ridiculous.  Less than 200 hundred words, links to abstract pieces as if those are proof of something. The droves of blind followers in the comment sections.  It reminds me of something I'd see on fox news or NYT or WaPo.

I've already set the disclaimer that I'm progressive.  So, I obviously have some disagreements.
But, I think we need to move past that.  I know if you and I were sitting in person shooting the shit, we could come to agree on the same thing, regardless of news and who we are getting it from.

Crypto has many battle fronts.  Don't you think politics is one of them?
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:35:33
Just trying to follow, here...  You say that...
US President outlaws hoarding of gold in 1933 - not sure what hoarding translates to, technically.
1970 something, US President changes hoarding law
Shortly after, US President takes USD off gold standard
Then, 10 year prison and/or fine for owning gold coins/bars.
"Of course 'they' hate it?"  Who is they?  Presidents?  FDR?  Nixon?  Ford?  Republican Presidents?  Democratic Presidents?  US treasury?
I'm genuinely trying to understand what you are getting at.

As a leftist, I'd still 100% support Assange if he released everything.  It's beyond doubt that he had more than just HRC emails, and yet he selectively leaked.  Leak it all.  Show us what ALL the corrupt politicians are doing, not just the ones from a specific political party.
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:59:23
I get it.  Crypto aint waiting for no one.
I'm not a troll, though.  Just trying to add discussion and insight for the poor historians that have to scrub through these fucking reddit threads.
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:59:21
Fair enough.  I think we could debate the merits based on the times.  But, today, I think we are in agreement.
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:56:27
Right. Updated my comment to clarify.
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:04:56
Thanks. I agree that Sean is honest because he claims himself that he is an entertainer and not a journalist.  I could get into why I think that's dangerous based on my family's propensity to believe an entertainer over a journalist and Fox News' willingness to let people like my family falsely believe he's a journalist, and not an entertainer.  But, that's not the point here.
I think if we want non partisan information, we have to be careful not to seek information from specific sites, or sites that confirm our bias, but rather from all sources even if we disagree with it.  We should be averaging out our information, not filtering or censoring it.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:31:58
Haha.  I'm beginning to think so, but I'd like to know more.  Educate me.

I consider myself leftist and we have zero interest in seizing assets of the productive class.

He (Rand Paul) [wasn't one of the eight]( that went to Russia on the 4th.
He (Rand Paul) did [hand deliver]( a secret letter from Trump to Putin, though, which is still sketchy AF.
Edit: clarified I meant Rand Paul not Ron Paul

I appreciate your words - I really do.  It's been an eye opener for me today.  As a progressive, I couldn't get progressives at the MJ comment section to calm down for just a second, but yet here we are breaking bread.
Good luck to you, too, friend.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:45:00
This is one of the talking points on MJ.  Bitcoin was created for shady people to do shady shit.  They conflate that with what your saying, which seems subtle.  But, in my opinion, it's bullshit.  Lots of US DOJ cases to prove that you don't need crypto to do shady shit.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:40:31
Fair enough.  But, that's like saying Sean Hannity - Fox News' largest viewership program - is just a single journalist with a strong opinion.  He's got a big microphone.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:50:46
I've always been a progressive purist, and attracted to the progressive movement because they're the closest to that.
I am wakening up to the fact that they can be nearly as full of shit.  I still support the "movement", but I will oppose anyone like Kevin Drum at MJ who so clearly seems to be towing a line.
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:27:02
Agree, but... what are your thoughts on why Assange only released HRC emails, but not the stolen RNC ones that he had?
I was a full backer of Wikileaks as a non-biased-everything-is-exposed-regardless-of-affiliation-or-contribution-organization even when Republicans were bashing it, but, when they released HRC emails and not RNC, emails, WTF?  How is that unmasking censorship exposing all information, not just selected information?
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:29:56
That is one thing I've noticed - their obsession that Bitcoin is nothing unless it is accepted as a means to pay taxes in the US.
