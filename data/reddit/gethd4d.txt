Im saying exactly what you read. Still over 35% down. Consolidation is always 10-20%. Not 50. And not 35.
We broke a few big support levels. This can get messy quick.
If this gets to 18 without cracking down again we'll be lucky.

Sympathies to all those affected. That is very sad.. Suicide hurts so many besides the one who does it. Im sorry he put you and your family through that.
Greed and a missed oppritunity which honestly was simply  luck...
Only If he was mocked by family and cast aside and thought of as insane Id see why BTCs rise would tear him down.
But simply losing out on an oppritunity.. Selfish to make you all go through that. There is no better definition of greed.
This makes me sick in so many ways.

If history repeats at 18-19K the Dip will happen. And it will be lucky to be above 10K. Then it will settle at 5-6K.
Thats IF history repeats. Which i doubt.

Oh my im flattered by such large comment. But no, i dont believe that is at all what i said. I just said uncertainty in BTC is why the prices in alternatives are going up. As in, people who have had large bags in BTC are branching out into the other currencies they know have already existed. Nothing about popularity over the bitcoin name. Thats absurd. I left a comment below this one specifically stating bitcoins tenure and widespread name being its grab.
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:21:15
Uh oh.  A spike in price insecurity posts like this are a sign. M8 I get the emotion in this post, but this ain't parabolic lmfao.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:12:31
Uh. Youre money figures are terribly off. BTC went from 7.9 ish when BCH began gaining. BTC dropped to 5.5. And now BCH is gaining and still strong. And BTC has barely recovered to where it was.
Look at charts. BTC is desperately trying to break the low 8s. If it doesn't soon it could very well stabilize and begin slowly leaking out.
I hope for the sake of crypto it doesnt because the bitcoin name gets people started much quicker typically because of how known it is.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:13:16
I should stop commenting after this: [The problem is that you're saying to much and assuming. And boy, you know what they say about assuming. I still dont see where i assume a failure scenario at all. I simply pointed out that alts are rising because of the uncertainty of BTC.]
But i will graciously accept your desire to banter. Im just pointing out that alts are rising in correlation to BTC being stagnant. This comment is not the one i was referencing. There is indeed one more on this board i left which is the one i was referencing so apologies for getting you mixed up.
The uncertainty of BTC.. As in the clear uncertainty circulating recently about itself in general. Its transaction speeds. The failure to fork. And BCH is getting pumped up and in an uptrend. Now some hodlers feel threatened. BTC has barely recovered since its drop to 5.5 but BCH has tripled. This is what is causing some hodlers "uncertainty" in what they are hodling.
Failed Fork, Lesser Tech, BCH price spike: to sum it up. This could lead to a failure scenario no doubt, it has most of the ingredients that lead to failures.
Am i saying it will? No. But i wouldnt be shocked if it did.

Disclaimer: Obv could be totally wrong. I feel 11/16 will be a downtrend day for BTC.
And honestly, looking at all the charts, its pointing to BTC either A: Stabilizing. Or B: Getting ready for a downtrend.
Hodl on ladies and gents. I think the BTC storm is about to get started.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:03:11
This answer is so wrong. Bitcoins questionable outlook right now is why the entire altcoin market and other currencies are absolutely flying.. if bitcoin fails it will be by its own doing. And it absolutely could. People are questioning it more than before because the bag hodlers that wanted out couldnt get out and switch to other currencies when BCH had a spike. Why? Because BTC couldnt handle the transactions. Some people were over 24 hours backedup waiting for a sell to go through. That makes people question the currency and not go all in. Bitcoins tech simply is not there, yet*?
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:47:40
What the heck is happening here.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:34:34
Woah. I didnt mean to hurt you. Ive been building rigs and mining Eth and flipping btg/bch. Im actually very happy. Its pretty fun. If BTC doubles or triples, awesome. But right now it had a failed fork, tech is lacking, and noone really knows whats next. Im not gambling on something that is struggling at the moment to move north. Ill spectate BTC and continue with my easy flips and mining.
Also: Tip: Saying i "missed out" on btc insinuates you feel its not going to continue on with its massive growth. Not very hodler.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:53:02
Im not saying that is not the case, im following the market and where i can make my money. The future of crypto means shit to me if i hold onto something currently risky in the shortterm for minimal gains. Or lose money. Right now for ME, my money making methods are not in bitcoin.
This group of wealthy individuals and miners unfortunately have grounds to convince new hodlers regardless of their shit intentions. And its not their faults for these pumps and sell offs of BTC. Its ultimately the fault of BTC.
We now have some btc holders feel the devs are 
1.)"scammy and money hungry" because of BTG/BCH
2.)A failed fork with low explanation
3.)Lower tech vs a more current fork.
how is this truly manipulation? These "rich guys" are just pointing out some current faults of BTC that need to be properly addressed. Until they are properly addressed and explained, These BCH pumps will continue.

Undoubtedly agree with the technical advantages But again, you know the reason i feel they are going up is likely because people realize after the botched s2x, BCH pump, slow current tech "Hey, you know what, theres more out there".
The altcoin large recent rise has timed almost exactly with the BTC/BCH debacle. This is why i feel these alts are getting more looks and gaining. Its a great thing of course. I just hope BTC doesnt off itself.

There's nothing wrong with someone showing what their proud off. Especially in this sub (a place revolving around it).. The onlookers who let their own sourness / envy toward it affect them, is what becomes the issue.

I hate the comments on here saying he promoted shitcoins, shilled, etc etc. That's completely wrong.
If the only thing you did was look at thumbnails and titles, maybe that impression could happen, for sure.
He did have videos where he talked price but he was never pumping. Just trying to peg what's causing a downturn or uptrend. Most videos were incredibly informal. Even if he made a video on "shitcoins" it wasn't to shill. People request the hell out of something that's causing a stir and he breaks down what that particular crypto is and what it's purpose is.
His channel being lost is a pretty big hit.

The contradiction to believing in bitcoin is that you hodlers call the other coins your beloved dev team made happen "scams". Scams, but they have better tech.. and bitcoins segwit2 got halted.. ..... Do you not see the concern here or has the high got you somewhere else? Yikes.

I get that, thats the thing about it that makes it different than a stock, or a housing market. If a few hundred million people start using BTC as a currency, the market cap would likely be in the trillions (and obviously BTC would need upgraded tran times..)
So in that regard 10,000 could easily be the baby stages.
So yes, many factors go into the rise. But there will be a correction. One thing that doesn't change is volatility. And thats a dangerous game.

Remember, Bitcoin and many other cryptos post transactions on a public ledger. So if one address is found to have done illegal activities all you need to do is search that Bitcoin wallets address to see all the others it interacted with.
