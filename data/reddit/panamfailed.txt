I looked through your comment history and I believe that you don't care where the drugs come from or who gets hurt as long as your supply isn't interrupted.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:29:23
But you said emphatically that there is more than one.  You didn't qualify it by stating it was the defenses position.  So anyone reading your comment must conclude it is your opinion.
  
But now that you've said it, I'd like to hear what other qualified people have to say about that particular ruling.  I do not believe you are qualified.

Ross is 30.  You don't even know how old your idol is.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:34:46
Sorry, I thought it was done because you said they covered the entire trial.  When is he being sentenced?  I would think that would be an important and dramatic part of the film to capture!
   
I looked it up and it was supposed to happen yesterday.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:45:05
Thanks, this explains a few things for me.  Nice to know it isn't done and they will include all of the trial from start to sentencing.

The obvious bias towards drugs was just the icing on the cake.  he continues to invent facts and talk from a position of authority on a subject he appears to know little about.  Aside from the doing them and how to get them part, of course.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:12:21
Like I said, I think you're a liar.  You don't even know how old Ross is yet you're supposedly a professional on his trial and how many DPR's really exist.  Do yourself a favor and stop smoking pot and actually take some time to learn something about what you're talking about.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:28:37
I'm not going to be convinced by a drug addict like you.  You've proven your bias.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:13:09
Did they include his sentencing in the film?
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:26:55
Does Keanu weigh in at all?  Lyn is obviously biased, so I would like to see some unbiased assessment of the case.
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:04:19
It's evidence of you lack of due diligence.  
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:45:57
I already explained it to you but you choose not to see it.  I'll re-itterate one last time for you and I won't waste my time again.
  
- Dark Markets enable drug cartels who harm innocent people.  People are basically slaves making these drugs and when there is pressure on the supply, they have to work harder and the cartels need more of everything to meet the supply.  This is just one small example.
  
- The people running the dark markets have yet to prove they do anything good with the profits.  Look at Ross for an example, he did nothing to help others while trying to have people murdered.  Again, one example.
  
- Drugs on Dark Markets go through no regulatory process, so you have no idea what is in them and if it will harm you now or later.
  
- Dark Markets do not inform, this actually appears to be changing as some do offer education material on safe use.  But the sellers do not include it in their products as best I have seen.
  
- Dark Markets mask the problem and abstract the suffering so that you do not have to see it, further enabling the cartels.
  
- Dark Markets force law enforcement to adapt and get better at impressing these laws on us.

Why are you so desperate to convince me that you are right?  What is wrong with you?  I don't actually care to know the answer to those questions.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:14:49
This is the source of my confusion, it was supposed to happen already.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:23:21
Why would they plant evidence when he admitted to running the silk road?  That's like planting meth at a meth lab.
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:37:52
The fact that you say things that are not correct plus your obvious bias does discount anything you say in my eyes. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:29:15
Of course you agree, it fits with your bias.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:58:35
He stated that there is more than one DPR and has made other conjecture towards the Ulbricht case in his comments.  In addition, he regularly attacks anyone who says anything negative about Ulbricht.  I think he should know and offer the right information if he is going to attempt to be a bastion of knowledge on the subject.  I don't believe that is unreasonable.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:30:40
We all have to take responsibility.  That's how you make change happen, passing the buck does not make change happen.  
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:32:09
Ross could have walked away at that point instead of becoming a potential killer.  If it's true, this reflects very badly on him.  SR is far from honest business when it enriches people who will kill to protect and further their enterprises.  Those drugs had to come from somewhere and we have good evidence that the people who supply the drugs do it at the expense of innocent lives.
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:53:10
The stories aren't rare at all.  Look at Mexico and how many lives have been lost and how many are lost every day.  Look at every South American country and you will find it, even in the few places where it has been made legal.  You are not doing your research if you believe Dark Markets are helping.  They are only helping to provide a budget for law enforcement and make them better at impressing these laws upon us.
  
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:32:09
You are so delusional.  Get off the drugs and clear up your head. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:24:48
He was scheduled to be sentenced on the 15th, today is the 16th. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:42:53
How does SR help make that happen?  Dark Markets can be shut down and it's giving law enforcement more excuses for a budget and more tools to oppress.  Dark Markets are making law enforcement better at the oppression you speak of while enriching the source of the drugs.  Those sources do very bad things to protect their enterprises and dark markets are only fueling their power and control while putting pressure on their supply and forcing the workers to produce more, which creates more suffering for the producers and the innocent lives in the middle of the supply chain.  It's not like your cocaine is coming directly from the source and completely abstracting all the bad things that happen in the supply chain.  Dark Markets only help to mask the suffering while enriching the sources.
  
We need the war to end, but not at the expense of more lives.

Re-read them when you're not stoned.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:56:11
It looks like the defense is trying to get a retrial.  Personally, I'd love to see the case retried, the public can only get more information than what we already have from a retrial.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:03:01
It has its place, I certainly don't want to see it change.  You should be thankful about how many options are available to you.  I use both Android and iOS and I use them differently because I know about the strengths and weaknesses of both.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:35:27
It's apparent in your posting history.  When there is history to review, it helps me understand the point of view of the person I am debating.  Your submission history is very pro drugs and anti drug war and you have proven you don't care where the drugs come from as long as you can get them.  Am I wrong?  Can you quit?  Have you tried?
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:23:10
This right here appears to be how you justify your idolization of Ulbricht.  In your mind, all of the really damning evidence wasn't him, it was some other guy.  Did you smoke two joints this morning?
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:13:51
I don't believe anything you say at this point since you appear to just be justifying your own actions.  I bet you pay taxes too.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:36:26
It is not widely agreed upon.  Show me a poll with information about the polling pool that "widely" agrees.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:29:56
Thats too bad, I can't way to see it for myself.  Hopefully it will be objective and won't embrace the obvious bias we see in the comments here.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:26:55
My logic is that you should not participate in systems that harm others.  You're a walking contradiction to me.
