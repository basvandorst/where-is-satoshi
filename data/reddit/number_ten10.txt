Gotcha. Haha. That’s insane. 3D printing cards with bitcoin in them. The future hahahaha.

Understood. I still think it’s a good sign that a big bank like Barclays can so easily pay someone with bitcoin with their label on the card. Obviously it’s not a huge deal, but a positive sign nonetheless!

Why did they choose to pay you with bitcoin?!? To me this is very exciting that a big bank would actually pay you in BTC. Did you ask for this payment method?

Agreed, I would need to learn how to do that, but  I don't think I have the technical ability.

Are you saying they caused the big bump for all coins this year or they started when that happened? Thanks

Your price analysis was spot on tonight. It seems others had their AI and/or trading set up to buy right at $3,900. Do you post about your model or are there other bloggers/redditors who publish results/estimates from their models? I'm trying to take that next step in my purchasing, knowing when within a day or a couple day span to buy. Thanks. [edit: and yes, 100% agree main factor is Chinese government. Though I do hope it is better for the long run as a result. Is it possible they will make a centralized/single crypto market in China that is state backed/run? Lot of money/taxes could be made that way.]

Very interested to know if you have a model working for this. I 100% agree with your logic, but how do we know if it is a 15%, 20%, or 25% drop? We've been at a 15-20% drop for a week or two, what makes you think it'll keep going down in short term? (Besides the dinosaur named Dimon at JPM)
