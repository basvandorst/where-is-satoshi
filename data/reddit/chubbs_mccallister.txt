I did the math several weeks ago for my phd dissertation.  I ignored statistical outliers and focused mainly on the median probability given studies by Kolier, Sharman and Reece, et. al., proved that was an adequate representation.

But without insurance, you have to just take the companies claim they are storing coins securely.  
If a company has insured coin storage, that means they had to prove to the insurance company that they are storing coins securely.

You won't ever identify that symbol because it is alien, it is not of this world.
You may remember that in January of this year an asteroid flew between the Earth and Moon.  But this was no ordinary asteroid.  This asteroid carried a special passenger.  The passengers name is Dorian Nakamoto, and he disembarked onto Earth.
He was outfitted with a complete Earth human backstory, including a professed love of model trains.  But he wasn't prepared for the loneliness of being separated by 32 parsecs from home.  One particularly blue day, he went to a store that sold customized baseball caps, and had them print his worlds logo onto it.  
That was his fatal mistake.  The great tribunals on Blethra, his home planet, decided that this slip up must be dealt with harshly.  So they organized for him to be doxxed by a journalist as the creator of bitcoin so that he would be taken hostage until he revealed the location of his coins.  But since he doesn't have any, he would be killed.
