Rootstock is the way you can execute more sophisticated Smart Contracts than the very basic ones available in Bitcoin today.  It's a sidechain.  What is a sidechain?  See this:    What is a smart contract?  See this:   . Smart Contracts will be enormously disruptive in the shipping, banking, insurance, agriculture, etc. industries.

Plenty of my friends that read this crap try to warn me away from Bitcoin.  I remind them asking a banker, or in this case, a financial writer, about bitcoin is like asking the postmaster about email in 1990.

The word BUT indicates downside or a negative connotation.   “I like you BUT you your sister is cute.” 
I see downside in gold given its poor currency characteristics, ease of seizure, potentially unlimited supply, etc.

Hmm. I can pay friends, buy airline tickets, pay taxes and even buy land with my bitcoin wallet on my phone. That seems like utility. It’s also scarce since only 21M will ever be created and 18M have been minded so far. It seems it’s only getting more scarce.

Nope. I’m not.

Gold isn’t easily divisible.  It’s not simple to trade (authenticity, weight, etc). You can’t buy an airline ticket, pay taxes with it.  It is a good store of value, but sucks eggs if you actually go out and try to buy stuff with it.  I’m not saying gold is bad as a store of wealth, but I think you are ridiculous saying bitcoin is bad.
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:53:24
Fucking hilarious. People’s Temple massacre absolutely happened. The PhD that wrote that article is 100% legit and her observations about Trump’s brainwashing techniques are factual. Keep on drinking the Kool-Aid bro. The sooner you do, the sooner we can recover as country.

Serious question. What problems does a high mempool indicate during a rally?  I understand it’s the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed, but when it spikes what underlying principal problems are being revealed in the ecosystem?

My technical analysis, using the Holts-Winters method, shows a 78% probability that the price will go up or down today. This builds on my analysis last week that said it will definitely be above zero for the near term.  /s
