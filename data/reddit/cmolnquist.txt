This looks like a pretty good indication that the claimed MtGox TM leak/"hack" was never anything but a distraction. To many of us it never seemed even remotely plausible, especially not 850k coins over several years..
After finding a few suspect transactions it looked interesting, thanks for following this up with an excellent preliminary analysis.

Replace-by-fee is a _very_ bad idea.
Satoshi included a mechanism in the protocol specifications and data structures for _legitimate_ tx replacement - it's just not currently enabled in BitcoinQT. 
Using the sequence and lock_time fields prevents a tx from being replaced by another tx after the specified time (or block number, or ever if sequence = UINT_MAX). Essentially all transactions being broadcast now have sequence == UINT_MAX, so they should **never** be replaced if the bitcoin protocol is followed.
Any "replace-by-fee" mechanism that ignores the sequence and lock_time fields would not only be considered broken by Satoshi, it would introduce a huge and entirely unnecessary vulnerability to 0-conf transactions for no real gain at all.
Remember, decentralized double-spending prevention is the problem that bitcoin originally solved. 
So why are a few misguided 'replace by fee' evangelists now intent on re-introducing it as "feature"? Perhaps we should follow the money... hint: greenaddress.it may be a good place to start.

Here are two tx's in the same amount, to the same address, both from Mtgox, almost exactly 30mins apart:
Interestingly, they are sequential in a Mtgox payout chain.
Sort of what one would be looking for, but without a mempool log there's no way to see if it was a duplicated tx of course.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:05:49
That would be a good sign. One thing's for sure, there's a lot we still don't know.
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:18:10
These are supposedly coins either from Mtgox or held by them (many large 2k-10k transactions):
They are being broken up, dispersed right now (3/1/14) and run through the same mixer(?) (below) as the likely malleability attack coins identified earlier:

Could this be a more likely(?) mechanism for coin loss through TM:
@_date: 2014-06-20 16:42:55
At the end of the day - fraud is still fraud - if this service is used to defraud a merchant or seller it doesn't really matter whether it's called "bitundo" or "bitcoin for sociopaths" - it's still fraud. 
It's no different than writing a bad check, using a fake card or running out without paying after a restaurant meal. 
Only a replace-by-fee fanboy could come up with a scheme this ridiculous.

The receiving address shows several duplicate amounts for incoming payments, usually within a few hours of each other: 
Probably nothing, but fits well with the Mtgox version of events and an example of what to look for. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:14:42
Blockchain analysis is providing mounting evidence that there may be at least some fraction of truth to MtGox's claims that their system was exploited to send duplicate payments:
As close to proof as anything else so far..
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:59:13
Thats why mempool logs are required. The malleability attack was based on a modified tx (with a modified txid) being accepted into the blockchain in place of the original tx. Only the mempool logs would have a record. 
With Mt.Gox's dodgy accounting it's uncertain they'd have a record of the original tx's. If they did there would be no problem identifying the modified transactions.

6% of all bitcoins in existence will be somewhat difficult not to find considering it's a public ledger.

@_date: 2014-06-21 17:25:38
..which - to be honest - is an idea exponentially more ridiculous than the original misguided proposition.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:17:57
A log of a node's rejected mempool tx's at the time of the double payments would also identify any TM-exploited transactions (at least it would show that the tx's were modified/reissued). Some researchers and agencies with promiscuous nodes have those logs. There is evidence suggesting that at least some MtGox tx's were subsequently modified and accepted into the blockchain. No indication of the scope at this point, however. 850k coins leaked without being detected seems absurdly implausible.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:02:24
This looks like possible proof that their system was being actively exploited (inappropriate reliance on txid's modified using tx malleability). Confirmed to be payments from Mt.Gox.
Looks like many duplicate and some triplicate payments received within a short time frame.
The receiving address could be involved in the missing btc. Further analysis is required: Anyone with mempool logs from nodes showing these tx's and their corresponding modified tx's? This would be proof.
Who owns this address: 1BeFb9xhNcaDVDQ6pXGV21n7LwVwvXBW3f ?
Update: Coins running through a mixing service or exchange as this is being written:
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:44:11
There were actually 200k coins (180k + 20k) and there's virtually no doubt that they were moved under gox control.
An additional 111k apparently gox-controlled coins have subsequently been moved in a similar manner. That would suggest gox is still in control of at least 311k btc.
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:46:43
Any ideas about the owner of 1Ne5bGjDdgmbsGdNK9ocwrQiWf8K1FTuSa yet?
The Flexcoin theft of 800+ coins (3/2/14) , and certain suspect ex-mtgox coins ended up here. Appears to be some kind of tumbler/mixing service.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:37:15
Almost certainly a gox cold storage address. There is a direct connection to this address from at least one deposit made to gox in 2011.
This plus the 200k coins earlier would suggest that they are still in control of a minimum of 311k coins at this point. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:19:32
This is the same funds as the 200k yesterday, just a continuation of the process of breaking them down into amounts of approx 5-10 btc per address.
This is still following the MtGox algorithm (leaked source code) which was used to prepare funds for disbursement. No indication that there is anything unauthorized or suspicious going on. If MtGox or their trustee is doing the moving, this would appear to be a good sign: i.e. that they still have at least 200k coins. The fact that there was a nice round number of 200k coins being processed may indicate that that there are at least a few more in addition to these.
 
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:48:39
Make no mistake: They will mostly be traced, that is if they haven't already. We may never know the whole story but you can be certain that several three-letter agencies will. Where any recovered coins eventually end up is anyone's guess however.
6-7% of bitcoins potentially in the hands of unknown criminals will not be ignored. 
There is ample evidence that numerous large scale attempts at complete blockchain mapping have been underway for quite some time now. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:47:57
Clearly there is more than just one hot wallet address. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:54:26
Probably not too useful for tracing gox funds... Typical payouts were chained in descending amounts: Change from each tx was sent to a new address that was subsequently used for another payout... in a long chain until it was all spent. Probably just a function of the way their internal software processed payments. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:14:13
Actually there has been some evidence uncovered that TM was being used to game the Mtgox automated withdrawal system:
Seems highly doubtful that 850k coins were leaked that way, but there may at least be some truth to the MtGox claim.
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:09:11
MtGox has assured they are the only one able to.

Another gox collector that appears to be used to consolidate remaining amounts from payout chains etc., into larger amounts. Still has 600+ bitcoin:
 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:31:36
...and they're gone: Coins are being run through a mixing service of some sort as this is being written:
Definitely looks like these coins are on the run.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:29:57
Do any nodes out there have mempool logs of all tx's (including those dropped as double spend attempts etc)? 
If there's any credibility to the Mtgox claim of modified txid's that would make it very easy to identify the transactions responsible for the stolen coins.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:00:08
If the 100BTC withdraw was modified to exploit the malleability issue, then this would be very difficult to detect if txid's were inappropriately being used for internal accounting (as gox admitted they were).
At least as plausible than the other scenario.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:49:39
At this point, multiple class-actions filed against Mt.Gox will assure only one thing: That all remaining assets will go to cover legal and court costs. (i.e. a worst case scenario)
If there's even a minute chance of a purchase by a third party it would be a far better option for everyone at this point. The next few days should be interesting.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:41:46
Possibly - but there could also be a lot of legitimate tx's in the same amt to the same address. Not exactly sure how MtGox processed the claimed resent tx's... i.e. if it was always to the same address, in the same amt. or how long the interval would be etc. 
Narrowing the scope to intentionally modified tx's should shine a spotlight on things, especially before the initial Gox announcement (and the large-scale malleability attacks that followed)
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:06:01
If MtGox still controls the 200k bitcoin which they appear to, that's actually pretty good news. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:50:51
When you wave a few bitcoins through an eastern republic, it's amazing what you can find out.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:59:11
Probably something to do with 7% of all bitcoins in existence being currently missing/unaccounted for thanks to Mt Gox...
Remember, Mr. Karpeles is still (erroneously) blaming the losses on a 'bug' in the bitcoin protocol. When the dust finally clears and the market knows the truth it should go a long way toward restoring confidence. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:00:42
This. I'm sure at least a few of the million or so former gox users would submit info if there was a chance of some insight into what actually happened.
Once Karpeles gets lawyered-up don't expect to hear anything else from him.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:42:11
Mtgox should have records of every tx sent, as well as the associated user acount information. That would make it very easy for them to track the accounts responsible. Something doesn't add up, seems highly implausible they could lose 750K btc this way with no clue where they went.
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:15:56
Like someone else said on bitcointalk: It looks like Occam's razor has just been swapped for a plastic spork.
Does anyone really imagine these coins are being stolen and run through the original MyGox server disbursement algorithm, all while a multinational investigation team and millions of others look on? Is that remotely plausible?
More likely is that the MtGox trustee is still in control of at least 200k bitcoins - and that is not bad news at all.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:27:50
Obvious manipulation - but by whom? Only Kraken knows for sure. On May 7, ETH/USD was targeted on Kraken and Poloniex, with a DDOS making it impossible to access trading to cancel/place orders cover margins etc., resulting in significant market chaos for about an hour, but limited to those two exchanges. 
This is how Kraken is being gamed: Place a *big* market order on a thin order book, open margin positions will be called and immediately closed at market price by Kraken, adding lots of liquidity and allowing (lucky or colluding) traders to buy or sell much larger orders than the original dump. It works in both directions. ETH was sold on ETH/USD May 7, and XBT was bought on XBT/USD May 18 2017. Same game plan, different pair. What they both had in common was thin order books, lots of highly leveraged margin positions, and Kraken's clearly broken margin trading algorithms, which have proven to be easily manipulated. Someone saw a few million on the table and took it. Can't really blame them, they were taking advantage of an obvious vulnerability with Kraken. It was certainly no "coincidence" that a massive DDOS was involved on May 7, which they should not be dismissing, but investigating.
Kraken was adequately warned about the 100% certainty of this scenario playing out. I know, because I warned them. 
Bottom line: Margin trading on Kraken is basically Russian Roulette unless you have funds there to cover *all* of your positions several times over - but in that case why margin trade at all?

I have a draft white paper up at  showing that secure cryptographic storage on insecure media (like the NFC ring) can be a very workable solution for POS, bitcoin storage etc. 
Comments on the draft protocol welcome. Final release early Dec.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:02:39
The opencxp draft white paper specifically mentions the NFC ring and shows how it will work great with that protocol for bitcoin. 
The paper shows how this can be done securely using BIP38 scrypt-based encryption.
