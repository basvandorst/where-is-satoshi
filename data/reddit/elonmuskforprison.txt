I said its *inherent* value. The reason, outside of it being considered to be valuable, that makes it valuable.
Why is water valuable? Because you need to drink it to survive.
Why is food valuable? Because you need to eat it to survive.
Why is USD valuable? Because if you don't pay your taxes, you get kidnapped and put into a box.

USD has inherent value because the government requires you to pay your taxes with it. While it is a collective hallucination, it's one that the government enforces with violence.

Because shares are ownership by proxy of things with actual value and bitcoin is a collective hallucination?

Yes, but his philosophy is about boom-bust cycles is also about the market as a whole, not specific assets. Buffet would not say that general pessimism about a specific asset makes it a good buy.
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:34:06


You remember that Buffet thinks that bitcoin is a scam, right?

You mean like investing in shares?

Outside of "someone will give me value for bitcoin", why would I want to own bitcoin?

The internet is incredibly valuable *because* it allows the production of things that have revenue.

No, not really. Bitcoin doesn't really do anything that I can't already do. The specifics of how it does things differ to, say, a credit card purchase, but the end result is not meaningfully different in the same way that sending an email is meaningfully different to sending a letter through the post.

Stable != never changing.


Between 1980 and 2000 gold was pretty constantly losing value, even against fiat. Gold and silver have constantly and consistently lost value in comparison to investing across the stock market. Bitcoin (now that it is out of the exponential growth phase that any commodity will go through when the price goes from literally nothing to anything at all) will likely lose value consistently and constantly compared to investing across the stock market.
The comparison is not to fiat; the comparison is to literally anything that you could be putting money into besides bitcoin.

Fiat absolutely satisfies all the conditions of good money as listed here.

Not for me, I don't care about how efficient the system is.


This is not a coherent statement.


"Banks can be just as bad as exchanges" is not a reason to use an exchange over a bank.


Probably, yes. Or some other kind of fiat. Taxes aren't going anywhere.


The nominal value of a currency doesn't really matter as long as it's stable on a month-to-month and year-to-year basis.
On the other hand, if a currency can drop to 20% of its value in a week, then it *really* matters that it isn't retaining value.


Since we're talking about efficiency, how much power does bitcoin waste?


My bank account is comprised of digital assets.
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:24:32
Given any specific use case there will be another way to accomplish the same thing for which you think bitcoin is the obvious best choice.
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:19:10


The argument for the superiority of email over snail mail is that email is instant, fyi. Money transfers can be effectively instant.


The argument for storing your money in a bank over a bitcoin exchange is that a bank account is insured, and a bitcoin exchange can be comprised of one dead dude with a bricked laptop.
(Oh, and also bitcoin can lose eighty percent of its value in a year.)
Everything that you've written here amounts to "here are reasons to *use* bitcoin" which is completely distinct from "here are reasons to *invest* in bitcoin". I am willing to grant for the purposes of this conversation that there are niche use cases which bitcoin or some cryptocurrency best fulfils; this still does not produce value from your personal stash. Because the production of value is *making* or *doing* shit. The thing which is valuable in this analogy is the blockchain; an individual bitcoin can be worth any amount from $1 to $100,000 and it doesn't change a thing about how useful the blockchain is.

If banks are more expensive electricity-wise than mining, wouldn't they be proportionally more incentivised to go green?

Making drugs or alcohol illegal doesn't stop drugs or alcohol from doing the thing that I want it to do. Driving exchanges out of business *does* stop bitcoin from doing the thing that I want it to do (being able to move money quickly and easily and trustlessly).
Absent that, I may as well collect beanie babies.
