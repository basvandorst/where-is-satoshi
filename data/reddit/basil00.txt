It is quite possible that this is spam.  The tx is consolidating many recently-created small UTXOs.  The small UTXOs were created by long tx chains coinwallet-eu style, e.g. [tx1]( [tx2]( [tx3]( [tx4]( ...,

Note that most public block explorers (BC.I, tradeblock) are not even displaying these txs.  Blocktrail seems to work.
This also means tradeblock is underestimating the amount of spam currently on the network...?

Downloading and validating blocks takes time (which equates to wasted hashing); so some pools resort to mining an empty block on top the new *block header* (fast to download) as soon as it is announced.  The pool can only "safely" do this trick if they mine empty blocks.  
Meanwhile the new block is downloaded+validated in the background, and the pool will start mining a non-empty block as soon as that process is completed.  But sometimes an empty block is found first.

Bitcoin XT will propagate double spends (specifically, the first double spend it sees).  Bitcoin core does not.
A double spender can bypass network propagation by directly connecting to the RBF miner's nodes (assuming the nodes are known/advertised).  In this case, the lack of propagation actually helps keep the double spend a secret until mined.
@_date: 2015-06-20 07:59:58
Most "normal" (small, standard fee) transactions should be unaffected anyway.
For example, a 250KB transaction with a 0.0001 fee has a "fee rate" of (0.0001 * 1000 / 250) = 0.0004BTC/KB, and will easily outrank the attack transaction's fee rate of 0.0001BTC/KB.  Miners prefer higher fee rates.
To really cause mischief, the attack transactions should have a fee rate greater than (0.0001 * 1000 / 191) = ~0.00052, and will essentially delay all standard transactions with standard fees (191bytes = smallest "normal" transaction size).  However, this makes the attack much more expensive, at ~0.53BTC per block.
Edit: and as others have pointed out, high priority transactions (high coin-age) can be included into blocks regardless of fees, and should be unaffected.

I'm not so sure about that.  A 51% miner can ignore blocks found by other miners, effectively turning 51% into 100%.
This centralizes bitcoin, and the monopoly miner can cause lots of damage: block transactions, demand higher fees, shut down bitcoin (only mine empty blocks), or use the threat of a shutdown to demand protocol changes, etc., etc.

This is a repeated R-value attack ([some technical info](
Basically BC.i fudged up their RNG which led to R-value reuse.  This leads to a attack where anyone (following the above linked method) can derive your private keys.
The above thread linked an example of the attack.  [This transaction]( and [this transaction]( reuse the same R-value.  Click "scripts &amp; coinbase" and using the above technical info this becomes obvious.  This seems to have led to the "theft" of the coins to [here]( -- although the "thief" may be acting to protect the coins in this case.
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:15:30


Much of the BC.i theft is of precisely this category.
Basically, the attacker inserts himself as a MITM (e.g. malicious Tor exit node, but there are other ways) and performs a HTTP-downgrade attack.  Instead of serving the real BC.i JS code, the attacker sends a modified version that simply harvests the wallet ID and passphrase.  Many users do not notice because the interface is exactly the same, save for the lack of an 's' in the address bar.
A similar attack is possible if the server is ever compromised.  This is even worse since the malicious JS will be served via HTTPS, meaning that even the most careful user will have his/her coins stolen.
For these reasons I share the opinion that *all* ~~JS-based~~ web-wallets are a bad idea.

The current stress test involves generating *very* long chain(s) of transactions.
You can view it [here](  Follow the red arrow (highest tx output) to traverse the chain.
Note that mempool sizes on many nodes, including some block explorers, are inaccurate.  If a node misses a tx in the chain for whatever reason, it will not consider any of the subsequent txs as valid.  For example, at the time of writing, tradeblock thinks the [above transaction]( is invalid.  As such, a *lot* more spam has been generated versus what is being reported.

This is a good read for anyone still using BC.i wallets.
Some important points are:
* The new key stretching is still somewhat weak.
* Most existing users are still using the old (very) weak key stretching.
* BC.i happily accepts hopelessly bad passwords, e.g. "0000000000".
* 2FA is completely useless against certain kinds of attack vectors, e.g. a MITM that steals the wallet file, etc.

Absolutely.  This is my I don't like web wallets in general (I will edit the above to remove "JS-based"), not just specifically BC.i.  Also other services, such as bitaddress, may also be vulnerable to downgrade attacks (in theory).


Small nitpick: BC.i does not send the passphrase to the server (rather wallets are decrypted locally).  However this is no problem for a MITM attacker, since they can modify the JS code to steal the passphrase as soon as the user enters it.

This is good advice in general.  However, this tool does not make address reuse any more unsafe.

Nope :-)  Finding a 160-bit collision takes about 80-bits of work thanks to the [birthday paradox]( which the tool exploits.  Brute forcing 80-bits is very hard but computationally feasible.
Likewise, the example pair of addresses represent about 40-bits of work dispite the addresses sharing 83-bits.

No, as explained the tool exploits the [birthday paradox]( which means a 160bit collision represents about 80bits of work.  So the planet will survive.

A GPU version of this program would make 100+ bit collisions feasible.  With a GPU farm, maybe 120+ bit collisions.
For 160bits you'd probably need specially designed asics, and a hash-rate of similar scale to the current Bitcoin mining hashrate.  Nobody will bother to build this, but it is theoretically possible to so.

BC.i don't store user keys so cannot upgrade automatically.  It is possible they auto-upgrade as soon as you use the service (&amp; enter the password), but I am not sure.
Edit: Also note that this assumes that no attacker already has a copy of your wallet (with the weak encryption).  If they do the upgrade won't help.  To eliminate this risk, it is better to create a new wallet (BC.i or otherwise) and transfer your funds across.

The transaction fees are very interesting.  E.g. the [first transaction]( has a rather generous fee of 0.02BTC (versus the standard 0.0001BTC).

How about [this one](
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:25:19
To expand on this a bit...
The [speculation]( is that someone hacked BitStamp, stole ~18,864BTC, and parked it into [this address](
What is interesting is that all of the transactions that pay into this address have rather generous fees.  For example [this transaction]( has a 1BTC fee.  All of the other transactions also have generous fees over and above the standard 0.0001BTC.  I think such high fees would be strange if these were BitStamp-authorized transactions.
This isn't really a new type of attack per se.  I think the hacker just wanted to be absolutely sure his transactions were confirmed as soon as possible.  I'm sure he didn't mind spending a few BTC (of other people's money) in the process of stealing 1000s.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:54:25
The [first transaction]( has a suspiciously generous 0.1BTC transaction fee.  Here is a [similar transaction]( with an *extremely* generous 1BTC transaction fee!  Both transactions benefit [this address](  Perhaps these are stolen stamp coins?  A thief with 18K free coins might feel generous regarding transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:36:01
The hacker is waiting 1-3 blocks (10-30min) before generating &amp; broadcasting a transaction to steal the coins.  This is just an observation.  If BitStamp generated a "sweep" transaction immediately (=0min), the coins would be safe.
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:08:24


This does not help.  A new block at (B+1) found by the other 49% will be ignored by the attacker who continues to mine off block B.  Eventually, the 51% attacker's chain will be longer, and the 49%'ers chain will be orphaned.

This transaction relates to the coinwallet July 2015 spam attack.
The attack consisted of splitting 100s of BTCs into 1000s of 0.00001BTC outputs.  After the attack, and about 5months ago, coinwallet decided to consolidate all of the remaining spam outputs into the address [135zDqhbNcmPk3gbyeJmH75yiLdVZechsK](  They generated 1000s of transactions such as the one OP linked creating a ~1GB backlog.
There is an old wive's tale around here that transactions are forgotten by the network after 72hours (or something like that).  This is not true, the transactions are valid forever (unless double spent) and can bounce around the network indefinitely (as long as nodes, esp. older nodes, keep rebroadcasting them).
As such, transactions such as the one OP linked have been getting confirmed (slowly but surely) for the last 5months.  They have not been getting confirmed recently as they are currently priced out of the market (fee too low).
So far coinwallet have only managed to recover a fraction of the spam UTXOs.
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:04:17
I was also wondering this.  There appears to be a 1-block gap between between when the 75BTC was [deposited]( by the BitStamp user (presumably?) and then [stolen]( by the hacker.  BitStamp could have swept the address immediately, blocking the hackers transaction as a double-spend.  The fee is unlikely to help as the network would not rebroadcast the hacker's transaction.
EDIT: And the hacker is at it again, another [1BTC stolen]( since this thread was created.

Because (1) generating collisions for P2(W)PKH does not lead to any attack (it just means you can spend your coins with two different private keys, an interesting accomplishment but irrelevant to the security of Bitcoin), and (2) generating collisions for P2(W)SH can be used in attacks (e.g. 2-of-2 multsig), and can be done without the need for ECC multiplication.

Potentially.  E.g. the 10 test transactions already consumed ~150KB of block space that possibly displaced otherwise normal fee paying economic transactions.

Not sure about die; but it makes it possible for an attacker to generate a "DoS block" that is large/computationally-expensive.  The equipment and electricity costs for an attacker to reliably solo-mine such blocks is not prohibitively high (tens of thousands is my guesstimate). 
Ordinarily such blocks would propagate poorly, making it likely that such a DoS-block would be orphaned.  However, might no longer be a problem thanks to "SPV"-mining, where the big pools will happily build empty blocks on top of the DoS-block's header.

This is a bit complicated...but they are cleaning up zero-valued UTXOs that F2Pool themselves created in their last spam cleanup.
To elaborate: See this [Example](  Notice the input is 0.0BTC from a F2Pool UTXO created on Jul 10th.  During the last spam cleanup F2Pool attempted to save a byte by sending 0.0BTC to the empty script, rather than OP_RETURN'ing it.  However, this creates a spendable zero-valued UTXO which bloats the UTXO-set.  It appears that F2Pool are now clearing aways these UTXOs.  This does nothing to help the current backlog.

The catch is that a valid header for an invalid block must still satisfy the PoW check.  This means it is just as expensive (hardware+electricity) to mine an invalid block as a real block.
I'm more interested in what would happen if someone mined a valid block but only publishes the header.  Depending on how SPV-mining is set-up, it is possible that a long chain of empty blocks will be built on top.  There is no risk to the attacker since they can publish the block anytime they like.

This was part of F2Pool's spam cleanup (after the 7/7/2015 spam attack).  The attacker created 1000s of 0.00001BTC outputs to compromised addresses, e.g. brainwallet "cat".  F2Pool helped to clean up these outputs in transactions such as [these]( sending the entire 0.00001BTC value as a fee (to F2Pool).  This also double-spent many of the "sweeper spam" transactions that were attempting to claim the same coins, cluttering the network.
The problem is that Bitcoin transactions must have at least one output.  The "usual" way to send all input values as fee is to create a single unspendable 0-valued OP_RETURN output.  However, F2Pool saved a single byte by instead created a spendable 0-valued empty-script output.  The latter saves a byte but is spendable, so remains in the UTXO-set.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:00:55
are you around?  The "stress test" means the thief's tx may be unconfirmed for hours(*).
(*) the current fee rate to get into a block is around 0.001BTC per KB.  The linked tx has a fee rate of 0.000366BTC per KB, so has a lower priority.  But who knows what miners actually do these days.
EDIT: too late.  1 confirmation...

Because F2Pool/AntPool were mining on top of block headers.
1. Miner BTC Nuggets forgot to upgrade, generates an invalid (version=2) block 
2. Buggy F2Pool miner code accepts the header of  as valid (it should not I think, since version=2).
3. F2Pool starts mining an empty block of the supposedly valid header
4. Buggy F2Pool miner code rejects block  as invalid, but for some reason *continues to mine off the invalid header* anyway
5. F2Pool eventually finds an empty block ( and broadcasts it.
6. F2Pool continues building empty blocks ( has still not been validated!).  AntPool joins in with an empty block of its own.
The practice of mining empty blocks off headers is common but potentially dangerous, as was demonstrated by this fork.
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:05:15
Assuming no limits (as per the OP), a DoS-block can have arbitrary size or computational cost.  In principle the attacker only needs to solo-mine a single DoS-block.

These ones are even more tricky to pinch, since it is 0.00001 per UTXO (vs 0.0001 for the previous one).  Barely spendable.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:02:11
Instead of generating "long chains", a future DoS attacker could generate "wide trees".  So same tx volume but with a shallow depth.

Another version=2 block [was mined by MegaBigPower](
This appears to have sparked another fork by SPV miners, this time it went 3 blocks deep:
1. [ (Orphaned)
2. [ (Orphaned)
3. [ (Orphaned version=2 block)
Interesting that  was not even empty, meaning that some miners are *really* running some buggy code.

The primary spam transactions ended about a week ago as far as I could tell.
The blocks have remained full because of the (a) tx backlog, and (b) competing sweepers generating lots of txs trying to claim the "brainwallet cat" (etc.) dust.

It's a classic DoS attack amplification tactic.
I.e. The attacker generates 1 transaction to send BTC to a compromised address, then N sweeper bots generate N txs trying to steal the BTC for themselves.  So the attacker has amplified one transaction into (N+1).
@_date: 2015-07-20 01:23:00
The attacker generated lots of 0.00001BTC spam outputs and sent them to bitcoin addresses with known private keys (e.g. brainwallet cat).  Others (the "sweepers") attempted to claim these outputs for themselves, generating yet more transactions.  This was a DoS attack amplification tactic, i.e. the attacker generates 1tx, and then N sweepers generate N txs trying to claim the coins for themselves.

Don't get too excited.  Each 0.00001BTC input will be ~179bytes (you are using a non-compressed address).  So that works out to be ~5.586sat/B.
In other words you'll need to spend nearly 100% of the balance on fees in order to move those coins.
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:16:28
At the very least they should have rejected the version=2 header.  I think bitcoin-core will reject the header (see ContextualCheckBlockHeader() in [main.cpp]( so F2Pool must have been using different (&amp;buggy) code.
As for validation, I had presumed that F2Pool would be doing that.  But perhaps they do not even bother?  I.e. pure SPV-mining.
If more that 50% of miners do this, then the entire network becomes vulnerable to some interesting attacks.  E.g. mine a valid block but only publish the header, causing the SPV miners to generate an indefinite chain of empty blocks.  The shorter non-SPV chain can be invalidated any time of the attacker's choosing by publishing the withheld block.  This could be used for an n-confirmation double spend.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:02:18
Yes it appears to be another tx spam attack.
[Here]( is a sample transaction.
Edit: blocktail link since other explorers do not display the spam txs for some reason.
Edit2: For the skeptical, click on any of the 0.00001BTC outputs, 1000s of unconfirmed txs (~3200 at time of writing).

That was just one sample in a long chain of 1000s of near identical spam transactions, e.g. [1]( [2]( [3]( [4]( [5]( ... etc., for 1000s more.  The high fee just means it's high-fee spam.  FWIW the spammer stopped (for now) a few hours ago.

I tried the following method and it recovered an old address (bitaddress.org) quite easily under chrome/Linux.  Try these steps (may need to be adapted for the Mac/browser):
0) Open a console.
1) Find the browser tab's process ID.  (there may be several, try each one; for Chrome the process will have the name "chrome").
    ps -A
2) Run the command (substitute PID for the process ID):
    gdb --pid=PID
3) Dump core:
    (gdb) gcore
    Saved corefile core.PID
    (gdb) q
4) Search for valid private keys:
    strings core.PID &gt; strings.txt
    edit strings.txt
When I tried the old private key was still in memory, so was easily recoverable.
What you absolutely should **not** do is power down the laptop, close the browser, or even fiddle with the browser in any way.
EDIT: MacOSX gdb may not support gcore.  Are there any alternatives?

With BIP100, permanently decreasing **or** increasing the hard limit is a softfork:
* for a permanent increase, a softfork invalidates all blocks with a BV *less than* a given value
* for a permanent decrease, a softfork invalidates all blocks with a BV *greater than* a given value
This means that a softfork could override a "21%" attack.  But for this reason I also think it may be better for BIP100 to use the 50th percentile rather than the 20th to avoid forks altogether.

What happens if an adjacent node sends a fresh INV for a previously evicted transaction?  Is it ignored (meaning that the node keeps track of evicted txs), or is it treated as a new tx, downloaded, accepted to the pool and a *different* random tx is evicted?  The latter could form the basis of some interesting attacks.
@_date: 2015-09-10 01:49:08
Not cancelled it seems.  Redeeming all those small 0.00001 UTXOs *is* the 'stress test'.
@_date: 2015-09-11 01:06:22
There are several attacks I had in mind (for the current OOM-conditions):
* To evict a specific tx, just inv-spam other txs to the node.  Eventually the target tx will be evicted.
* (for miners) inv-spam the txs the attacker *wants* to include in a block.
* DoS attacks - continuous re-validation may be a possible DoS vector (mainly CPU).
Not sure how feasible these are -- that's why I asked.
Edit: a possible fix to all this would be to track the hashes of previously evicted txs.  So a tx will not be re-accepted until memory conditions improve.
@_date: 2015-09-17 03:11:11
Your tx depends on [this tx]( confirming.  That tx is low priority and pays a small fee rate of ~3sat/byte.
The current spam clean-up txs are about ~7sat/byte.  So keep the receipt.
EDIT: note that some pools (e.g. F2Pool, BTCChina) do not seem to mine txs with a fee rate less that 10sat/byte.
@_date: 2015-10-13 10:09:14

This attack is different.  CVE-2013-2292 is a CPU consumption attack (create a tx that takes a long time to verify).  This new attack does not really consume any CPU at all, e.g. look at the script:
    OP_0 
    OP_IF
        OP_15
        OP_CHECKMULTISIG
    OP_ENDIF
    OP_1
The checkmultisig is not even executed, but it still counts as 15 sigOps towards the 20000 sigOp-per-block limit.
Sample [tx](
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:28:04
The Bitcoin network is currently under a sophisticated DoS attack using the "fake sigOp" method described [here](
This DoS attack consists of specially designed P2SH txs designed to overflow Bitcoin's 20,000-SigOps-per-block limit.  The sigOp limit is analagous to the block-size limit, i.e. once it "fills up" then no more transactions can be included in the block.  The P2SH scripts exploit a bug in Bitcoin's sigOp counting code meaning that they do not really contain any sigOps, but are still counted as sigOps.  See the thread for the technical details.
For example, under-full block [ contains 17100 fake sigOps.  [Here]( is a sample of attackers transaction (225 fake sigOps).
The attacker's transactions have a fee-rate of 24.375sat/byte.
Edit: looks like the attack has finished.  Last few blocks are unaffected at the backlog is starting to clear.

You can use a [cycle detection]( algorithm to find a collision in O(1) space and O(λ + μ) time (see the wiki for definitions).
To elaborate: define f(x) = hash160(genPubKey(x)).  Then you generate the addresses {a, f(a), f(f(a)), ...} for some arbitrary starting address "a".  The sequence will loop after ~2^80 iterations thanks to the [birthday problem](  The cycle detection algorithm can find where the loop starts in O(1) space, which corresponds to a collision.
@_date: 2015-10-13 01:04:18
No the current attack is *redeeming* dust, not sending dust, hence the confusion.  For example, see the transaction 6b40ba19d22f82f1119fdad92af7bfe15792c3cdb3fd630d9c7e24285751a9c2 which is part of the current attack (this was just a random sample, there are 10,000s of similar txs filling up the mempool).
My point is that the attacker may as well spend any fee possible to redeem those dust utxos.  The alternative is to never redeem them, in which case the attacker gets nothing.
EDIT: looks like it is no longer possible to post tx info without triggering crypto_bot... :(
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:25:15
This might not prevent the current attack.  If the current 1sat/byte txs are not confirming then there is no reason for the attacker to craft new 5sat/byte txs from exactly the same 0.00001BTC uxtos and the backlog will remain.  The attacker is only priced out at ~11sat/byte, in which case the utxos cannot be used to construct txs that pay enough fee.
There is also no reason for the attacker not to pay the higher fee.  The alternative is to never redeem the 0.00001BTC spam utxos in which case the attacker gets nothing.
@_date: 2015-02-24 03:52:51


Or never.  A 95%er could devote 6% of his hashing power to DoS the old chain (51% attack to orphan all non-empty blocks).
These kinds of tricks are the reason why it is very important that no single entity gets &gt;50% hashing power.
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:27:26
Even if 90% of nodes are malicious, there is still a good chance that one of the 10 is non-malicious.
The other problem is that the attacker needs to set up ~60000 malicious nodes to get a 90% ratio (assuming ~6500 real full nodes).
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:58:08


On the contrary, this attack can be launched with IsStandard (P2SH) transactions.  See the sample tx in my post above, which was confirmed in the first block after broadcast.
@_date: 2015-02-19 06:20:49
Full nodes routinely communicate block and tx data via "inventory" messages (defined by the Bitcoin protocol specification).  If a full node receives an inventory message for some data they do not have, then they will attempt to fetch the data from the node that sent the message.  This is how data propagates across the network.
A bad node that never sends inventory messages is also not relaying data.  Such nodes are consuming network bandwidth without contributing anything back.

Zero-conf transactions have always been insecure, regardless of what Peter Todd does or doesn't do.  (It's not like replace-b-y-fee is hard to implement).  I think it is wrong to attack him for "breaking" something that is inherently "broken" (insecure) in the first place.

More concerning is a time traveler double spend attack:

You'd need vast numbers of PseudoNodes, such that becomes unlikely real nodes can connect with each other.  For Bitcoin this is probably 100,000+ nodes, otherwise the network will continue to work.  If you really had that many unique IP addresses, a simple DDoS attack is likely more effective.
@_date: 2015-02-14 13:20:31
PseudoNode does all of those things.
It can figure out the current height because other nodes tell it (in the "version" message).  It acts as a proxy server for "getdata" requests, so it will return a random blocks on request.  It collects peer addresses (and return on request) just like a normal node.
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:57:13
I don't think so.  The attacker can't control which other nodes the target miner/client can connect to.  So as long as they find one working non-malicious node, the target can still sync with the network.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:25:03
This specific attack is redeeming 0.00001BTC utxos.  There is no reason for the attacker not to pay the higher fee.  The alternative is to never redeem these utxos, effectively "burning" them, which costs the attacker even more.
This is why it is important to consider the specifics of each attack.  "Costing 5x as much" in fees may be irrelevant in this case.

I think this [test tx]( got malleated (second sig has high-S).  Maybe that confused your wallet software?

@_date: 2015-10-02 02:17:16
There is a big [tx malleability attack]( going on right now.  Basically, the attacker is intercepting txs, and replacing the low-S-value with the high-S-value in one of the signatures.  This results in a new valid (albeit non-standard) signature.  You don't need the private key to do this.  Some miners will happily mine the non-standard transaction.  Example: [tx1]( (original tx, unconfirmed), [tx2]( (high S, confirmed).

The pynode project describes itself as a "half-node", which is not quite the same thing I think.  For example, pynode seems to download the blockchain and do verification, unlike PseudoNode.
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:14:05
There used to be support for this built into the protocol, see [IP Transactions](  It was removed because it was insecure (MITM).
@_date: 2015-02-15 04:50:31
Yes this is possible.  In theory a hacker (MITM or direct server access) could change the bitaddress.org code to merely "pretend" to generate fresh private keys.  In reality the code generates private keys already known to the attacker, who can then steal any coins deposited to that address.  Running the code offline will not prevent such an attack, as the attacker can hardcode his keys directly into the software.
This is why if you want to use bitaddress.org you really should verify that the code has not been altered in any way, e.g. using PGP or perhaps compare with the version on github.
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:41:24
Things are a little complicated because the current implementation supports a few different configurations.
The *--prefetch* flag will caused fetch data (tx or blocks) as soon as the inv vote count has been satisfied.  Under this mode, PseudoNode will be a bit faster and more closely mimmicks the behavior of a normal full node.  On the other hand, this mode consumes more bandwidth, since it is downloading data that may never be requested by another node.  So its a speed vs bandwidth trade-off.
Also to answer credibit, PseudoNode does temporarily cache any tx or block data that it happens to download.
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:33:42
I had considered some similar ideas.  The counter-measure is to set up a modified full node that is willing to complete challenges on behalf of PseudoNodes.  This is what I meant by "cooperative" fullnodes in the FAQ.

Yes, my assumption is that there is nothing a malicious node can do that can prevent the non-malicious node relaying valid tx and block data, so the target can still "sync".


Yes, that is true.  But the pseudo-node concept does not introduce a new kind of attack.  The idea of flooding the network with malicious nodes is not a new idea.
