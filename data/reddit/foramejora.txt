Well it appears David S. Evans from Boston is a shitty journalist.
Negative criticism is warranted to the extent that it's paired with proper research. How about reading something, you fucking dumbass?

How so?

Aforementioned syntax is enough to preconceive the illegitimacy of their argument. It's not even worth reading.

I honestly just wish he would disappear like most criminals that get away with it.
So tired of hearing this fucker's bullshit.

You're a beautiful person. Thanks for that.

I encourage you guys to check out a book called Republic, Lost by Lawrence Lessig.
He puts the mutualistic relationship of congressmen and special interests in simple, easy to understand terms. It's interesting to know the whole logistics of how it works.

Oh, *come on*.
As far as what's been reported to mainstream media, there's little evidence supporting the notion that the charge was anything more than made up bullshit to drum up notoriety for the guy. 
And calling SR a criminal enterprise would mean you would have to substantiate the claims that providing the service for that kind of business while having no direct involvement in how it's used constitutes holding the developer accountable for the actions of the community.
It's the same bullshit that was used to charge Kim Dotcom and I'm fucking sick of it.

Yeah, well, Alan Greenspan is a piece of shit and I'm surprised anyone out there still values his opinion.

Genuinely excited.
The project itself looks great, but that Bitcoin is becoming accessible to young kids is just awesome. Props to her.

Probably depends on BTC status with the feds.
If it's seen as a currency, possibly, but I don't know how things would transpire if it's just a financial asset.

Well written and good move on behalf of Blockchain, but development-wise, I would say fuck iOS. Fuck Apple for letting competitive capitalist dogma intrude on a refined and better way of doing things.
I think we can unanimously agree on this subeddit that the current banking system is a problem, and if you want to be part of the solution, you can't be contributing to the corporate asshole of a monopoly that is Apple.
Fuck them, we will progress without them.

Truthfully, this reads like a post in [r/circlejerk](
Is there nothing to be said about more pressing issues, like for example, campaign finance reform, public education reform, strengthening the power of federal regulatory agencies, full disclosure of income of consulting and directorship arrangements, the blatant circumnavigation of anti-trust laws by multi-national corporations? Anything?
There's a lot of things with the potential to make the modern U.S. a shitty country, but inherently liberal modern "progressivism" is not where to look. Legalization of marijuana and homosexual marriage could pass as a federal law tomorrow and we would still be in a shithole. It's just the same sensationalist bullshit that got Obama elected and I'm fucking sick of seeing people get away with it. 
What makes you any different than the rest?

Their selection is much more broad, in my experience. Grooveshark really does have a lot of obscure titles under their belts. Also, no commercials. 
Mind you, I only used Spotify for around a month, while I've used Grooveshark for around ~5/6 years.

Sure, state jurisdiction doesn't necessarily apply to the issues pending, but at least appearing to give a shit about them may make you appear a little more than just a PR stunt targeted at the Internet culture demographic.


I passionately disagree with you and would ask you to elaborate.

Totally mind-boggling for me to think this was just a little less than thirty years ago.

Honestly I'd prefer that Bitcoin not be on Larry Summers' radar at all. He's a huge piece of shit.

*Holy fuck*, does this mean Twitter could get a BTC tip feature going? Jesus, this is huge.

As the great Nas says, forecasting exchange fluctuations is *a fool's errand*.
This is just petty marketing / pandering. We could hit $2k a month from now without anything to do with MU2
