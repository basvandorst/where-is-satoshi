@_date: 2017-11-08 13:44:04
I expect a major crash/correction around the fork. I cashed out My winnings. Yes it sucks that it went up again but it doesnt feel secure after this great Rise in short amount of time
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:19:49
They offer people to short the BTC market. Its negative
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:25:29
Yeah hope you can use them . Useless shit

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:00:10
For me a 5-10% a year is fine. This is just a joke. Remember where BTC was this summer or at the beginning of year
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:03:28
Check the graph and see all crashes
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:16:13
8k is kinda good, could fall Below to last resistnce at 5500
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:11:39
They may be promoting BCH hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:32:44

@_date: 2018-11-24 09:40:59
Feeling bad for the people who bought extreme amount of BTC when it dropped to 10k and called it discount..
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:20:09
Good choice of chart when 90% drop looks like a fart in space

Why should avarage Joe be afraid to get his bank account seized. These memes are made for criminals
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:30:39
How can we be early adopters when BTC Trading has bigger volumes Than the Nasdaq and 325,000 reddit subscribers?
We are early/late majority which means our money will be burned
@_date: 2019-01-08 16:55:44
Really 
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:46:36

You should be aware of how the security with bitcoin works? And not go to your closest neighbour and showing the private key. How will juanita know that when she has questions about a transaction
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:53:57
