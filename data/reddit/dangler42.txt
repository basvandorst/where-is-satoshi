Also wonderful that the developers didn't tell the shitcoin developers -- hopefully a bunch of them got smashed before the bug could be fixed there.

oh god damn it so much. there's such a thing as "fractional reserve banking." you can literally buy a reprint of the first edition of Samuelson (when this stuff was actually relevant) and educate yourself. being on the gold standard means fuck-all.

the US couldn't fight back against the Nazis? when did the Nazis fight the US?
although the US had long been sinking German U-boats (which was obviously an act of war), Germany did not declare war on the US until Pearl Harbor. Under the tripartite agreement, Germany was obligated to join Japan if Japan was attacked, but not if Japan was the aggressor. The Nazi leadership was divided on whether this was a good move. Hitler decided to do so on the basis that he thought the Japanese navy was strong and could defeat the US (they came close! and would have been a lot closer but for the unfortunate fact that the US carriers were not at Pearl Harbor the day of the attack).
Bottom line is that Nazi Germany did not attack the US. WW2 was a war of choice as far as the US was concerned. The US instigated the attack on Pearl Harbor through its actions against Japan.
If the US had not attacked Germany, then probably Europe would be a much worse place today and the US would lack the power in the world it obtained through the post-WW2 power vacuum.
So, I don't see what this has fuck-all to do with "bitcoin ceasing to exist."

Elevators aren't actually that safe, exactly because of those redundant systems. Not uncommon to see those systems bypassed when they malfunction, so in reality there aren't backups protecting you. Obviously you'll be fine if you're in an office tower in the USA. But China? Eh. Some crappy elevator somewhere which hasn't been inspected by the city recently? Eh.

because everyone and her hairdresser were buying bitcoin thinking it was a get rich quick scheme. then the number of suckers dried up, and people who bought near the top got off as soon as they could to minimize their loss, causing it to crash.
@_date: 2018-09-08 16:34:21
or.... in this case you know the guy lives in a newly expensive area which old people hate and drives an expensive car, and says very clearly he got the money from bitcoin, so he's probably made millions from bitcoin and is an insufferable mid-20s douche.

In 2010 Julian Assange started accepting Bitcoin. I remember this happening and I knew Bitcoin was a thing. It was basically a way to jump through a LOT of hoops to give an alleged rapist some money.
Silk Road lasted from 2011-2013. At that time, Bitcoin was absolutely known as a thing. Again itwas used as a way to pay for shady things.
The idea of buying Bitcoin for Silk Road was incredibly unappealing - to get it, you either had to trust some weirdos on the internet and send them actual money, or you had to spend time "mining" on your own GPU. (And remember the bitcoins weren't worth much so you'd have to mine a lot of them to get enough to pay for drugs.) Then you'd get into the "Dark Web" and hope that a different weirdo didn't cheat you or rat you out and then MAIL YOU drugs, which raises the risk that a dog at customs or USPS will find the drugs and then you'll get arrested.
In short it made no fucking sense at all to get Bitcoin back then. If you wanted drugs, the smart thing to do was, you asked your stoner friend to get some for you and you gave him a little extra for his trouble.
There is absolutely no reason that Bitcoin deserves a high valuation other than as a form of speculation. Yeah, sure the banks might get together and make cryptocurrency a thing, but why would they do it with Bitcoin instead of making a new cryptocurrency?
Anyone who invested in Bitcoin as an investment when the people taking it were Julian Assange and drug traffickers is certifiable.

exchanges do wash transactions so they rank higher and attract customers. pretty much any number in bitcoin land is manipulated to make someone richer.
@_date: 2018-05-16 04:59:36
There are almost no laws governing anything related to bitcoin. Exchanges lose money - depositors are fucked. Exchanges steal money - depositors are fucked. ICO companies steal money - investors are fucked. There are no laws governing market activity. Do you know how many laws and regulations govern activity in the stock markets? Literally none of these apply to Bitcoin. Of course the bitcoin markets are manipulated. If you find a way to make a buck in the market, good for you. Just don't pretend that these movements are organic. You're just along for the ride.
@_date: 2018-08-26 18:02:29
no, because there are other companies that make ASICs.

yes, "the bank unable to trace my money is a bitcoin scam." if the bank didn't get the wire there is nothing to trace. wire transfers happen all the time; the bank didn't decide to steal your $15,000. coinsquare is the sleazy operator here.

assuming the chart is actually being intepreted correctly, it's probably a ton of people who bought high hoping to get rich quick and are more willing to wait a few more years to see if the price ever goes up again instead of taking a loss of thousands.
doesn't mean they are confident in the coin, just means they don't need the cash right away and as long as the coin isn't plummeting to zero they might as well wait a little longer to see if they can get out of their hole.
@_date: 2018-10-06 19:06:34
yeah probably, if these funds launch they'll be buying coins which will bring the price up.
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:06:31
why would you sell 10 months after the all-time high? if you're such a true believer you might as well continue to hold, unless you need cash now. it's like saying you should sell your manhattan real estate in the 1970s. or you should sell your raphael paintings in the late 1940s.
I was a huge bitcoin skeptic up until a month ago - now it's obvious that with all the institutional investors in the space the days of wild yo-yoing are over. I don't know that it will "shoot to the moon" but the risk of collapse is pretty small now. Good chance it will go up in years to come, good chance it will stay about where it is, not much chance it collapses. The market is liquid enough that it's a viable store of wealth or way of transmitting money for people who need it.
I used it yesterday to send $125 to India, for $0.11 (minus the fees to buy the bitcoin in the first place). The alternative would be to wire money (expensive) or to give the person my bank information so he can do an ACH through a US account (are you fucking insane, hell no).

largely yes, because the "dumb money" (i.e., your mom's hairdresser who heard of bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme) puts money into Bitcoin. MAYBE Ethereum. all the shitcoins get turned into bitcoin, then cashed out. if bitcoin falls they all fall.

you're talking about GPU prices right? as in, don't buy in january but just wait for six months before buying?

Miners won't default on anything. It is a massively cash-rich business. They already paid for their equipment. They may stop mining (for a time, and in certain areas with higher-priced electricity) if the price drops below the variable cost.
It will be interesting to see what happens when the price drops below $3k or so, which is the value of electricity used for some miners.

you dumbass why do you think 6000 is a support level just because it's a round number? there has never been any evidence for a "support level" in bitcoin.
it will decline until the miners start to find it unprofitable. we're probably at that point now for older miners in more expensive jurisdictions. why knows what will happen after that point.

yeah and if you never sell you are out your entire investment.

@_date: 2018-06-23 00:13:57
???? lol have you never taken high school econ? if your variable cost (electricity) is greater than the marginal cost (bitcoin price) you do not produce, barring unusual situations.
"paying off capital investment" is not such a situation. if you want to pay off your investment, losing money in electricity costs is not the way to do it.

Of course people come home with more than GBP 50 of currency. They get a certain amount of cash and have cash left over. Since a dinner or taxi ride could cost GBP 50 it is quite normal to have more than that left over.
It's stupid to spend money just "to use it up" - if you don't need to buy anything, keep it and convert it back into your home currency.

so how much are the Mt Gox depositors getting back?
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:16:29
because unstable currencies ARE a viable means for payment. the whole country of Zimbabwe or Venezuela or Iran, notwithstanding the hyperinflationary currency, will accept that currency for goods and services.
bitcoin is used in situations where normal banking institutions refuse to do business, e.g. black markets.

If a friend asked how much I make or have saved, I would see no reason not to tell him. Friends talk and understanding each other's lives is part of that. Or particularly if it was a romantic partner, knowing each other's financial situation is important at a certain point so you can figure whether your lifestyles are compatible.
The difference with bitcoin is that they are stored at your house. It's like saying you have gold bricks in your house. That is foolish. Word gets around. You can get robbed. Nobody can break into your brokerage account without kidnapping and torturing you which doesn't happen in this country.
