What the hell are you talking about. First, have you actually looked at the charts ? Name one asset that did better since jan 2009, take USD value for comparison. Second, 'store of value' and day to day spending ? And Third, fixed price ? Fixed to what, the dollar, euro, yen, gold, .......? It's a new asset class and by definition and by it's very nature it can't ever be fixed to another asset. It's probably going to keep on rising in USD value, or any other fiat currency, due to its deflationary nature in the long run.

While I agree, I also think Bitcoin's traceability and pseudonymity are going to be important for its worldwide legal adoption. For now I don't mind Bitcoin not being fungible.

If you're running your own VPN you don't have to wonder if it's compromised, I'm sure you could hide almost everything from your VPS provider ? 
Someone using a VPN isn't a noob - he/she wouldn't bother - so he/she would be tech savvy enough to use a VPS and docker containers ? As a non IT'er, I find it relative simple to use VPS's and docker containers. Furthermore several VPS providers charge per min, so you could launch your VPN when needed and only pay for the time it was up. That's how I do it, but I still use the same VPS and same IP; my next step is to figure out how to launch new VPN's with different IP's and how to connect to them (e.g. change the IP in the .ovpn file, I wonder if this works) without too much hassle and how to hide (encrypt everything data and metadata) from the VPS provider.

That's a matter of interpretation and like you said yours is based on the monetarist school. To me money inflation = more money in circulation @ t + delta_t and price inflation = 1 unit of money buys less @ t + delta_t. How money inflation and price inflation are related is a matter for discussion, but to me they are closely related, albeit price inflation happens at a later time because (in the fiat world) new cheap money is used to lower the banks' huge leverages before it flows in the real economy.


The delta you're talking about is the same as the bids and asks on the exchanges and last quarter there were a lot more bids. This delta has nothing to do with inflation or deflation, at least not in monetary units. 
My 5 cents.   
EDIT : 


Yes it is. BTC in circulation will be higher tomorrow, the day after tomorrow etc. and the rate at which it gets higher every day decreases.

@_date: 2015-06-05 14:09:54
Totally agree with your points, except the ASIC-resistance marketing scheme of altcoins. ASIC-resistance usually means a reduced speed increase between CPU, GPU, FPGA and ASIC, meaning ASIC's won't have a 1000 fold speed increase compared to GPU's for example, instead the speed advantage will be much smaller, only 10 fold for example. This means ASIC's are not impossible in principle for those algo's, but manufacturing an ASIC for such an algo won't give you the same speed advantages as ASIC's do for sha256. Keeping this in mind, it is reasonable to believe no one will invest in ASIC's for such algo's unless the value of the crypto's tokens make it worthwhile, which means very expensive. Disadvantage of those algo's is they are easier susceptible to botnets.

You could also use poloniex.com (I use it to buy and sell the only altcoin I'm interested in : Monero) They recently introduced margin trading. You can offer your BTC to margin traders and choose your own interest rate. Trick is to choose an interest rate which is not too high, because as soon as someone offers a cheaper loan, your loan will be closed and the trader(s) get the new cheaper loan automatically. Right now the lowest BTC loan offer is 0.07% per day = ~30% per year. Once your BTC offer is taken, you can't cancel it - only the margin trader can do this by closing his position - but you can choose your lending period.

The wild wild west days are more or less over, so you can call me paranoid, but I don't thrust chinese exchanges yet, even from Honk Kong ( which is more or less independent from mainland China when it comes to financial regulations and laws ) 
As far as I know they are the only one that offer margin trading, which can be very interesting for daytraders and high risk bets, but I read somewhere they offer 'hidden orders' when playing with more than 100BTC. I don't like this. This is the same kind of 'shit' (couldn't find better word) high frequency traders used and/or still use on Wall Street. There have been scandals about those practices for which the SEC is still investigating ... it's so complex and involves so many data nobody really knows how it all works. If you think you can outsmart them, have the most sofisticated algorithm and supper fast tradingbot (you would have to be located in Hong Kong for that) Bitfinex is the place to be, if not stay away.

From what I've read and remember at the moment the probability that someone succeeds in doublespending the coins after 3 confirmations is negligable (&lt;95% or even 99% don't remember exactly). With zero confirmations the probability is a (lot) higher, but can't remember an exact number. With a lot of small transactions the number of lost coins is negligable. For a large transactions you should wait at least 3 confirmations.

Because the definition of fiat money is somewhat ambiguous.
I guess most people here think fiat money is money that isn't scarce and/or is money for which it's emission isn't governed by consensus. Community implies consensus.
Some definitions say fiat means no intrinsic value and intrinsic value is arguably a false proposition. There is no such think as intrinsic value. Even if you say gold for example has intrinsic value because you can use it for jewelry  and electronics, you could argue bitcoin has intrinsic value because you can transfer it almost instantly, globally and without any friction. Those unique properties give it an intrinsic value.

Good question if it's true that many bitcoiners hate altcoins.
I for example didn't hate altcoins, but after some research I had the impression altcoins where mainly experiments (sometimes good ideas, but not enough peer review or sometimes plain pump and dumb schemes) and not to be taken seriously.
Now I see the picture is much more complex and I think some altcoins or in general some algorithms have to be taken seriously because they give an answer to some fundamental issues Bitcoin has. I think complete anonimity and fungability are such examples.

I think you misinterpret my post.
The Bitcoin community will never pay any 'price'. The protocol/code/software can only be changed unless the majority agrees. 
Bitcoin is open for everyone and I still think Bitcoin should invite everybody to participate, the masses, the small and big investors, even the toxic players and if regulations can be a catalyst for that I'm in favor. Whatever regulations they invent, it will only give them the illusion of control and I've no problem with giving them this illusion.

You're absolutely right about the similarities between religion and fiat economy. 
I don't think the masses are intellectual inferior. They're brainwashed and indoctrinated since childhood and afraid to let go their beliefs. I'm hopeful enough evidence and proof will eventually convince them, at least a (great) part of them, but you need time for that.
When it comes to Bitcoin, I would like to see a more aggressive campaign against the current financial system. I've used the words 'war' before, but nobody wants to hear those words. Still, current corrupt worldwide plutocracy has reached such astronomically proportions, I genuinely belief something has to be done and the use of force has become a necessity, or nobody, no government, no laws, nothing will soon be able to stop them ... a few will own the world (justice, army, money, politics, ... eventually the world's mind)

Alright, volatility is a good reason, but I encourage you to buy some. Start with a small amount, $100 like you said or even less ... it's generally a good idea to engage in something if you really want to know it.
To me, volatility and the possibility of a down market is a risk I'm prepared to take. I think it's reasonable to conclude volatility will go down when Bitcoin adoption grows and there's no reason to believe Bitcoin adoption will go down, at least not in the long run (maybe temporarily when the price goes down due to legal problems or other factors) There aren't safe assets any more in my opinion. Fiat money loses its purchasing power due to massive printing, real estate can lose value, we've seen it during the subprime crisis, stock markets can crash, .... it's all about the right timing.

If it's true the whales have moved from Bitstamp to Bitfinex I can give a possible explanation.

For example : you want to move your cryptoassets to another blockchain tech where confirmation time as faster and anonymity is guaranteed by zero-knowledge transactions. If this other blockchain tech is an altchain you have to buy those altchain tokens and consider constant changing/volatile exchange rates. If this other blockchain tech is a sidechain, the exchange rate is fixed (or deterministic) and the conversion happens in the protocol (no exchanges needed).

Since Borgstream Core will prevent a real blocksize increase at all cost, you could say big blockers want a hard fork at all cost. They want on-chain scaling - as much as possible - which frankly is just common sense, but some individuals have turned the narrative in a very very strange direction, like bitcoin is digital gold, we need a fee market and on the other hand miners can't be trusted (doesn't make sense), lets prepare for a change of POW, etc ... anyone following this debate for years is just eyebrowing and whether you agree with BS/core or not it's clear they are just pathetic Bitcoin thought leaders.

Fiat works by coercion, bitcoin doesn't.

I presume you would call yourself an anarcho capitalist, like many Americans who are for some weird reason nostalgic to the Wild Wild West.

I appreciate your reply, again.
I think you have the wrong impression. I'm certainly not a statist. I'm an anarcho socialist. I agree with what you're saying, but make different conclusions and merely want to warn of the dangers of (Darwinian) Capitalism, of which we see some results today.
 Two remarks :


Yes, of course. This doesn't mean the dukes son should inherit it by default (he was just lucky to enjoy a higher education). Power and authority is never self-justified, especially not when it is based on an ancient notion like inheritance.

What attack vectors ? Apart from quadratic hashing, which can be fixed, what other attack vectors do you know when raising the block size, and I mean block size limit (not block size weight, as in SegWit) ? 
And yes, it IS common sense to raise the block size. If devs are capable to pull something of like SFSW I'm sure they would find a solution to raise the block size safely, and gradually. It is not common sense to keep it at 1MB. Furthermore, even Core devs acknowledge sooner or later the block size will have to raise for LN to work properly. Some just don't want to raise it. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:23:43
First, how can you seriously suggest something like this ? Miners have put millions into their mining operations and even if you launch a Bitcoin fork with new POW, who is going to follow you ? 
I'm not talking about a possible future broken sha256 here, I'm talking about the narrative of some devs, demonizing miners and threatening them with a change of POW if they would run alternative clients for example ... I'm sure you'll find lots of examples - especially from this fruitcake Luke-jr, who proposed a blocksize decrease! - if you do a search in this sub.
Second, it fits the narrative. "Don't trust miners, use payment channels and only settle on-chain when needed", demonizing miners. For fuck sake, why ? Hodlers want a healthy network where users AND miners are happy.

Patrick Byrne from Overstock.com is thinking about something like this, he even applied to the SEC with a plan to sell Overstock shares with crypto-tokens if I recall correctly (I don't remember the details)
Apart from the legal issues, it would be nice to see some crowdsourcing efforts where someone could by a crypto-share from a company instead of a perk in return for a present/product. The transparant nature of the ledger should make it possible to track all transactions linked to (maybe only a part of) a company's revenue and by extension provide a transparent metric for the company's shares (and possible dividents); Just a thought.

For gold, oil, etc. fungibility is an intrinsic property.

Bitcoins can be marked and treated differently. Yes they still have the same utility and the only difference is perception, but in case of theft this perception is very real and the victims will act accordingly.

My 2 cents ... take the waited USD/BTC rate from Bitcoinaverage, add a BTC-price column next to $-price based on this rate.
You should make an weighted average for your reference (BTC) price - e.g. weighted on the number of people using a specific currency, like EUR in the eurozone -&gt; population = 338,335,120 - instead of the $-price as your reference to overvalued and undervalued fiat/BTC prices.

Why would someone call a blocksize limit increase contentious ... it's a logic thing to do.

Same here, where does this come from ? Don't you see it ? Another bone thrown out at people again with the same intent ... FUD about hard forks, confusing people with technical mumbojumbo, manipulators thriving on complexity , etc.


First, what's wrong about altcoins, I own some to ... most of them are garbage, some have a very good reason to exist. This shitting on Roger Ver is absurd and fits the narrative of those who want to block a hard fork. 
We're clearly on opposite sides, one thing I know for sure ... the battles will be fought with hashpower. Again, new people are coming in town and you can't built a wall around it, sooner or later you're gonna have to choose, adapt or leave.

Now tell me, who is malicious and who has a real agenda in here ? 
You realize a conflict of interest means there is a possibility a person or group could corrupt the motivation or decision-making ... what do you think happened here the last 3 years. Who's in control of the narrative ?
If devs can make something complex like SFSW, they sure could have written code for bigger blocks while solving the problems like quadratic verification time and others, knowing very well it's inevitable the network will have to HF someday, especially if you want to take layer 2 solutions to their full potential.

As for oligopoly, this is debatable, and the situation will probably change for the better (more decentralization), since ASIC's have reached state of the art production processes ... the only way forward now is more ASICs and there are no more major efficiency gains possible at this point (perhaps quantum computing, but that's far out).

I think you idealize 'free market'. What if someone gets immense power (e.g. +50% hashing power or +75% merchant transactions or ...), you really think the 'free market' will always be able to counter this and self-regulate somehow ?

Bitcoins are the asset, they don't need to be backed. Just like gold, art pieces, land, real estate, ... isn't 'backed'.


The fact Bitcoin doesn't have charge-backs is also a feature.


You have a point here. You could accept bitcoin payments and keep them, no conversions needed in that case.


How long do you think it takes to make fiat transactions ? Besides, for small bitcoin transactions or via payment processors you don't need block confirmations and transactions are instantaneously.

My reply was to Throwahoymatie, but since you share his belief I'll give you my answer to some of your statements I believe to be false.


Nobody builds a business completely on his own. They all got help from friends , employees believing in your idea (not just a paid job), creditors (also believing in your idea), customers, ....


Doesn't have to be so. I think current phenomenon of rising taxes is because the wealthy don't pay any and the people are to believe lower taxes for the wealthy benefits all because they create jobs aka trickle down economics, which is a lie (has been scientifically proven in Piketty's latest book). Another reason for higher taxes is the huge debt of the governments, and would very much doubt this debt accumulated because your government spend too much on social welfare. Dare I say your government spend too much on the military, bail outs of the financial sector, ... kind of nepotism between the government and big corporations ?
I completely agree with you big governments are a no go.


While I agree this is a bad idea in general and I'd say big capital should pay more taxes - and not less - which you might call forced sharing. This isn't the case today and this leads to plutocracy.

What's your problem with socialism exactly.

I think you need to read more about socialism. In short I believe socialism has a lot in common with the p2p philosophy - the core  principle on which Bitcoin is based - with 'sharing' and 'helping' as  important factors. A lot of bitcoiners declare themselves as anarcho-capitalists, which to me is just another ideology that leads to a savage world based on the notion 'survival of the fittest', imitating the cruel natural world with it's natural selection mechanism, not something human civilization should be based on ... we should be smarter than that.
If your question is sincere and you're interested in this all, I suggest you read Noam Chomsky (or look at some of his talks on youtube)

Yes, but they are known and everybody can participate. Kraken also introduced it recently and calls it 'dark pools'. Large hidden orders at Kraken are only executed against similar sized orders (so they say). I don't know how it works at Bitfinex. Maybe you can enlighten me.
In general I'm against hidden orders, but I'm especially against them if they serve a happy few and if the mechanism isn't made transparent.
There was a period on Wall Street hidden orders were a secret and now that everybody knows about it, you can't easily participate in it. [Here's]( a nice documentary on the matter on youtube.  
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:34:58
In what you could call real 'capitalism', one can default and the creditors loose (part of) their money. Current political and economic affairs don't allow this to happen, the lender is forced into more debt, and repeat ... Off course, what is a default if one talks about a a nation state ? Ironically, the IMF is currently the only actor in this mess who openly declares Greece needs a debt relief.


Don't forget a lot of wealth is created by exploiting others, war and even theft in lack of true justice. This wealth is often sustained by  political and economic policies that are not in peoples interest, but only benefit those who control this wealth.

Probably yet another one who believes capitalism is some sort of natural law emerging from human nature and free markets, survival of the fittest. For now he feels confident in this game, he's willing to defend this system at all cost, until disaster strikes. 
You're absolutely right. The saga is very far from over. I'm hesitating, do I wanna see tanks roll in Europe again, a wake up call against plutocracy and darwinian capitalism or should I hope this will cause pain but keep the peace ?

Yes the 1% and yes the banks. They sustain the system because it is in their interest and they are powerful enough to mold policies and laws for their benefit and their benefit alone.

I don't attack the free market, the problem is there' isn't a free market, it's an inflationary worldwide monetary policy supporting a debt based economy, enslaving the world and it's future generations for the benefit of a happy few, aka the 1%, the plutocrats and those at the top of multinationals powerful enough to mould policies in their advantage. 
On top of that defaults are not allowed, losses are socialized, creating more debt and the future gains are capitalized again by the plutocrats. 
On top of that people are to believe trickle down economics works, while it doesn't and only benefity the happy few, again. 
I'm sorry I call this (crony) capitalism, maybe unrightfully so, but it fits in my understanding of current worldwide affairs. Capitalism is indeed feeding worldwide plutocracy and the '(un)free' market needs adjustment in the current situation, we need to restore the balance.

Greece can't pay its debts, plutocrats should take losses on their books, the Greek people should not suffer from this insane debt system and the former Greek leaders (2000 till 2008) should be brought to justice.

You can use poloniex.com to short or long altcoins @ 2.5X leverage with 0.25% transactions fees and market driven lending fees, meaning loans offered by poloniex users with variable durations and interest rates, e.g. currently BTC loans have a 0.17% daily interest rate, LTC loans have a 0.004% rate, ... and you can close your short or long margin positions at any time.
Additional info : USA based poloniex was hacked some 2 years ago, but as far as I know everybody got eventually his money back - not without controversy when they halted withdrawals - and now they are considered one of the better altcoin exchanges. Approx 2 months ago they announced their money transmitting license, which means  you can withdrawal max $2000 / day (worth in bitcoins or altcoins) without AML/KYC, only a valid email address is needed. For larger withdrawals you need level 2 and/or level 3 verification with all the AML/KYC required documents like passport ID, photo ID scans, etc.

One solution is to use ring-signatures and stealth addresses at the protocol level (cfr. CryptoNote) to make every transaction unlinkable and untraceable. Some drawbacks are a faster growing and bigger blockchain, etc. Theoretically this could be implemented in a sidechain if you don't like the concept of altcoins. Could also possibly be implemented in the bitcoin protocol (hard fork) but very unlikely to happen.

Ok, my thoughts : I'm only following bitcoin for ±3 years and I'm not a dev or programmer, I just try to read a lot (bitcoin and altcoin). I think ring-signatures are not possible with sha256 and/or current POW, which means current mining hardware would be obsolete implementing ring-signatures, so practically impossible to find consensus and to implement.  
Many experts have said it : the bitcoin protocol is 'good enough' like tcp/ip was good enough and the network effect does the rest. I think true fungible cryptocurrency (unlinkable and untraceable transactions) will never happen with Bitcoin, but will only be possible through 'meta layers' on top of Bitcoin like sidechains or treechains, or separate blockchains (altcoins, e.g. cryptonote coins, e.g. Monero)      
EDIT : I recently learned zero-knowledge transactions - some believe to be the holy grail for true fungible crypto - would need a blockchain so obscure, nobody would be able to check if the supply rate is happening according to the rules.

The moment we hit block  the block reward will be halved to 12.5 BTC (current block reward = 25 BTC). You can read more about Bitcoin's controlled supply at [
Estimated time until block  is mined can be followed at [  
I believe this event will have an impact on the value and/or price of Bitcoin, it will rise. The inflation rate per year will drop from 9% to 4% (scarcity) and mining will be more expensive (electricity cost). The effect will be a slow and spread over many months, part before the halving and part after the halving.

How would you know that ? Depends on the numbers of asks and bids and the complexity of the matching algorithm. Ultimately it depends on the number of cpu cycles (in case of data collection it would depend on the Proof of Diskspace or Proof of bandwith or...)  and therefor electricity needed to run the algorithm. 
When you look at the idea of sidechains, the only incentive to mine a sidechain would be transaction fees. same logic applies to a Uber like algorithm.

Again, I think you could decentralize it with a trustless based architecture, so yes I think u can.

I'm not sure you need cryptographically verifiable proof of a service delivered. Services like Uber and Airbnb are merely a bid and ask matching service, as far as I know they don't take any responsibility for either party. I don't see why in principle this can't be decentralized. Consumers could decide whether or not to transact with a party based on their reputation and vice versa. This reputation system could be maintained in a decentralized system.

Interesting method. Don't know about security though  ... only thing I know is generate your keys from source on a offline puter.
I wonder, how do you spent from your multi address with this setup in practice ?

This is what I think, but do your own due diligence and make your own conclusions :
It's an evolving mechanism, so its always a new and different trigger. Nov 2013 bubble regular media wasn't positive, but the story of the guy who bought an apartment with $25 worth of bitcoins in 2010 went viral on regular media and brought enormous awareness to the general public. Next the silkroad bust and the very positive US senate hearings on bitcoin.
Next bubble will have another trigger and could be anything : something happens in Asia or in Africa, maybe it could be something   trivial like google accepting bitcoin (not likely : I would consider this noise in the info stream) ... but when in happens it lasts several days and you will see euphoria in the bitcoin community. 
Meanwhile I'm not even sure we've seen the bottom yet. 
EDIT : meanwhile all charts (  hashrate, ...) and metrics will have a steady (slow) growth

Sorry, I wasn't paying attention, I thought I was replying to francis_pov who started this thread with "personally, I believe in GOD".
I still disagree with you about chaos. You could in principle make a mathematical formula describing an explosion, but this does not make it orderly. By the way, some believe reductionism has it limits and science in general has the tendency to look at [holistic]( approaches  to understand chaotic and complex systems.

Yeah, lol. Maybe he had to. The market caps were to small for his wallet.

hum, no they don't ... only reason and common sense is needed.

They = authorities ? Well, yes indeed, therefor blockchain technology will make the 'nation states' obsolete eventually.
