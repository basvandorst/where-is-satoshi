China is playing with the price and milking the cow as much as they can b4 the game is over for them.
Didn't you notice that everytime they are about to dump hard, there is a rally up before? Just look how they went past 3000 CNY yesterday right before they dumped hard. And that patern keeps happening and happening.
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:08:24
Oh, you see, that's because you are in USA.
In Europe we write the date like: 20/4/2014, so that obviously means the price must be $204 by then.
Change my view.

@_date: 2014-02-17 04:39:54
Now, that would explain that MtGox was insolvent. In fact, I would even be sympathetic with the guy.

You are just some idiot BTC fan boy, that doesn't look at it as a currency but at something that will make you rich without working for it.
You are what's wrong with this experiment and why it will never work. Because you are, unfortunately, the majority of the community.
You refuse to acknowledge the obvious problem of security and as such will never even try to look at a solution.
Good luck with that and in playing in your little private club with your bitcoins, when mainstream looses interest in this crap because of all the insecurity it implies and the price goes down to where it belongs after all the crap that's been going on. Simply because you don't even want to hear about trying to solve the obvious problem here.

Well, it pisses me off that someone can manipulate the market just like this by playing Gox.
With, what, could very turn out to be just fake money/BTC if tomorrow some statement comes from Gox saying BTC there where actually lost.
Many people think that is impossible. But really, looking at it in a purely rational manner. Do you really think it's impossible for MtGox to have lost at least a part of the BTC there after what is been going on lately?

Let me put it this way.
China, and China alone took us from ~~200$ to 1200$ in less than 2 months.~~

@_date: 2014-03-04 22:26:07


A couple of questions:
- If you already have 1.45 coins how are you going to buy and push the price up?
- What does bitcoin benefit from other people driving the price up artificially? Isn't this supposed to be a currency for all the people and not only for a few?
- Did you buy at 700$ on Stamp?
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:59:38
Now I know this is the currency of the future.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:59:34
What is that supposed to mean?
It's their business, that makes them millions. Of course they are more interested in protecting it that some guy that has 2 BTC there.
And yet, they fail. What does that tell you?
That they are incompetent? Well, even if they are... I bet they know more about it and took much more precautions about it than 99% of the people that use BTC are able to do.

@_date: 2014-02-26 15:35:49
I have look at it. I like Ethereum but that will need major revolution to the blockchain, which as we can see, the developers are not willing to do.
I've seen Mastercoin as well.
But in those you are not really using them as an exchange. That's a delayed buy and sell platform where you have no security what-so-ever that someone actually transferred the money to you until you see it in your bank account.
That's not a way to exchange money.... specially in such a volatile market. I want to change my BTC for USD or vice versa when I see the market is going to crash because of some bad news or it's going to run up because of good ones.
BTC needs exchanges there is no way around it. What it lack now it's **credible** exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-02 13:34:13
I think you are seeing this the wrong way. The fact that the victories of the law enforcement agencies are more and more short lived, is a serious threat to bitcoin. It can just be the argument any government needs to outright ban crypto currencies and open the flood gates for all other governments to do the same.
How many stuff was put down and how many personal freedoms removed from the citizens with the - fake - argument of terrorism, child pornography, drug dealing?
Bitcoin community must find a way to prevent this... even if it means giving up a bit of anonymity.

Actually to me it's very clear what he is saying.
You need better protection against theft in bitcoin.
Some projects are trying to apply that to other cryptocoins (ethereum). It's just the the BTC world not only doesn't want to solve the problem, they don't even what to acknowledge there **is** a problem.

And how are you supposed to get bitcoins now-a-days?
Invest 10K in a mining machine? Not everyone has that kind of money they afford to potentially loose.
And even if you pass it to your computer then what? It's not easy that they can keep it secure there. Java vulnerabilities, malware, phishing, etc...
People don't want to be all they life looking over their shoulder to try a new fad. If it's this insecure mainstream won't use it.

@_date: 2014-02-21 13:27:24
WRONG: Gox price is not a matter of fear. Gox price is simply a matter of manipulation. That's why the cancer needs to be removed.
Some people have been watching closely the bot working a Gox. How it refills it's own orders in order to sell to itself, hence not loosing money (except in trading fees... but if the bot belongs to Gox actually, it's not even paying those trading fees) and dropping the price continuously with that.
It's against this absurdly obvious market manipulation - the majority of the - people are against.

Even people with high technical skills are getting robbed all the time. You may call MtGox, Silkroad, etc, screw ups. But think about it for a minute, don't you think that even being screw ups they know much more about this then a normal bitcoin user does and sill got robbed?
Some projects like Ethereum are going in the right direction... pity that the BTC is choosing to ignore them instead of embrace them.

It's ok, I'm laughing at the end, since you just seem to have lost about 100K USD... in great part because you where greedy and/or dumb.
I feel bad for the little ones that lost some hundreds or few thousands of USD there, but bigots like you, that want only to save their fat asses while letting the little ones drown, surely deserve to loose big.

@_date: 2014-03-28 04:58:51
True that. But in Gox, people couldn't take the BTC out. In here they can, so they can just buy cheap in China and then dump in the other exchanges.
And well... let's not forget that the biggest amount of BTC is in the China exchanges.
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:07:01

That's not surreptitiously, that was plain to see to everyone that actually trades (not most of redditors though, so they just down vote this stuff).

*"and finally, why post on a "Bitcoin" forum if all you are going to do is criticise from the point of view that you DONT actually believe in the topic ?"*
Sorry I read not Everyone knows people have money in their wallets (everyone carries some money around with them on the street after all) when they walk around. Yet, are they consistently robbed? No, they aren't, and you know what? Because robbers know they can actually get caught, **and** if they get caught, they are looking at a punishment.
Now, does that happen with bitcoins? Well, no, it doesn't, so nothing is stoping someone from robing you.
Major banks, don't get hacked every month. That's complete bullcrap, so post any thing that backs that up.
People that have money at banks can get scammed. But 1. It's the user fault and if it isn't, the bank has to pay for it. 2. There is a good chance to prosecute the robber since you actually know where the money went. Does that happen with bitcoins? Well, again, no!
You are completely missing the point about Silkroad. The thing is that they are guys that are computer savvy and actually know about security and they got hacked, just like Coinbase got hacked, just like MtGox probably got hacked. Point is, unless you keep your Bitcoins in a paper wallet for all eternity, the major chances are that you will get robbed. And what's the point in having a currency that you cannot use because you have to keep it in cold storage for security motives forever? None.
So, stop shutting your eyes about the reality. There is no chance in hell the mainstream is going to adopt bitcoin after all this. 
Have you read the Lord of the Flies? Did you see what happen when you leave a bunch of boys alone with absolutely no accountability and supervision? That's exactly what's happening to bitcoin.

If there wasn't an arms race to more and more powerful mining rigs and everyone still mined with their computers, bitcoin would be much more spread amongst the public, you would use much less energy and nobody would have to pay for specialized equipment.
I think that was the original idea behind Bitcoin, but of course, greed always overcomes reason and now we are at the current state of affairs.

That would be difficult to implement for social reasons.
What could be made by the devs was to create a special kind of wallet where transaction would take a minimum set of time and could be canceled at any time.
For instance, you could store your coins in a wallet where the minimum time to make a transaction would be 1 week. And during that one week you could cancel the transaction. That way in case someone tried to steal you, you just had to check your wallet every some days and easily prevent a theft.
Then you could have a simple wallet with a small amount of money for day-to-day transactions.

You obviously didn't read what is written. The problem is not the high price, the problem is a never ending raise of the price. If that was the case nobody would use BTC for what it was intended, they would just hold to it locking it in cold storage until the price reached 100000 and then cash out.

You couldn't get stolen in internet's infancy because you could just choose not to use money in it at all. And that' was not such a big deal.
Money only started to flow on the net after it became safe enough.
Bitcoins is by definition **money** you can not separate it from the whole, while you wait years until that major issue is solved, if it ever is.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:10:27
To be fair. Actual bankruptcy would mean the company assets would be frozen immediately and then divided amongst the shareholders (in this case mostly MtGox clients).
This way, people cannot get their money/BTC back.
So no, bankruptcy protection is actually worst than full bankruptcy, at least for Gox costumers.

Debian is known to be quite secure and if you are just going to use the system to store your BTC and do BTC transactions, Debian is good enough. The new graphical installation system is easy enough to use and gives you a functional system at the end.
Also, it has the added benefit that it can be installed in older computers than Ubuntu, so you can just use and old computer you have lying around for the purpose.
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:42:20
Bullcrap again. All the other exchanges when they had a downtime after Gox announced the vulnerability (that existed for almost 3 years but ok). The first thing they said was: "Don't worry this is temporary, your BTC are safe".
There is absolutely no reason for MtGox not to say the same. Unless they aren't actually safe and they know or at least suspect they lost part of their costumers assets.
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:23:07
So, you saw some transactions that **you** claim are comming from MtGox.
How, great proof. Let's indulge your totally arbitrary assumption that these coins actually come from MtGox. Still, even like that, what does this prove? That MtGox can move coins around? Oh the shock.

1 - Some people thought that Russia's central bank had banned the use of bitcoin completely. Well, in here it says, they don't feel the need to immediately ban all transactions. In fact they had stated since the beggining that *trading* BTC was allowed. **What wasn't allowed was to use it as an alternate currency.**
2 - There was a communicate from the Russian equivalent of the general prosecutor stating that any people using bitcoin could be immediately added to a terrorist watch list and investigated.
This statement here clarifies something about 1. But 2 continues to hold.

I refuted all your arguments. You just keep coming up with half-truths to prove the unprovable, so I gave up in answering correctly because there is no point.
Still, because you and your arguments are asking for some public shaming where it goes:
- Tell me someone that's in jail for stealing BTC, like you implied in another answer.
- How are you going to sell this to mainstream by telling them: 1) they need a computer just for this purpose that is never connected to the internet where they can actually keep they bitcoins. 2) go trough the process of transferring them to a hot address 3) creating a new cold storage address to send what they didn't spent back to a new cold address. Just the tough a normal people would go with this is absolutely moronic.
- There is a clear demonstration of a flaw in bitcoin that was used to steal money. And either you don't know what you are talking about or you are tolling. There was a flaw, and it was **in small part** the culprit of MtGox loosing the clients money. It was not a big thing for sure and it's fixed now. But there certainly was. So, it's up to you to prove that it was all just a big lie, and that flaw never existed.

It's not a proof, it's a definition. Solvent, means it got enough money to allow their costumers to withdraw what they want. MtGox doesn't allow their costumers to withdraw what they want, so, they are insolvent.

You are deluded. The 99% actions won't start being anonymous automatically because of some crypto currency. We have a long road to walk in that direction.
On the other side, the government and the 1% where always protected by the anonymity. Just look at all the money they move in and out of offshores.
If the government wants to know what you are doing, you know very well, they will know it.
Bitcoin would have a lot to gain from taking anonymity out of the picture, at least that way, the government wouldn't have an excuse to shut it down, and if the 1% and the government wanted in, the 99% would actually know what the 1% are doing with their (our) money.

TL; DR: No it's not and it will never be unless we go to an ATH.
My opinion is that people got way over their head in buying specialized mining equipments that costs tens of thousands of dollars.
The original idea about bitcoin was that anyone could mine it on their computer and although early miners would get an advantage, anyone could join at any time, use their computer and mine some bitcoins, enough to keep the eco-system going.
Now-a-days, new entrants to the bitcoin world only have two options: Buy bitcoins from the ones that already have them or buy extremely expensive equipment that will never give an ROI at the present numbers.
That's a serious hindrance to the mass acceptance of bitcoin.

Sorry for your loss. Unfortunately this is a normal thing in the bitcoin world.
BTC-e always sends me an email asking for confirmation of a withdrawal, so that part seems normal.
But can you explain better:
- Did you remove the 2FA authentication yourself or just sent a ticket to their support about it?
- Also, go to your gmail account (if you use gmail) and check for the logins there. See if any it's not yours.

- For instance. MtGox is not processing SEPA withdrawals with a minimum reliability for months now. You can have one or 2 people that *claim* they have received from SEPA, in a Universe of thousands saying there is no money to be seen.
- Then you take Shrem word like it's the Pope. I seem to remember the guy was just arrested.
- Like a bitcoin developer pointed just 2 days ago. The invalid transactions from Gox are not sporadic. They are going on when everyone solved that problem already 2 weeks ago. That the most obvious conclusion is that means Gox is not working on the solution.
- Try to figure out in your head why someone in the middle of a crisis deletes their twitter feed but doesn't have time to make a 140 letter statement giving some peace of mind to their costumers.

People are understanding this bug wrong.
This bug doesn't affect the servers (so exchanges). This bug is harmful for you, for your browser. An attacker can have access to your history/passwords/certificates/etc.
So, you have to change patch your browser and change your passwords (everywhere, not just for BTC sites). The only thing the sites (exchanges and others) can do, is to issue new certificates so that you know you are now being directed to the correct site.
You can read  for a better overview.

Trading in Gox is really a bad idea. If you are in Japan I think you can get the money out... if not, pray they put the BTC withdrawals back online and take everything out as soon as possible.

I read the article, it seems that you are the idiot here and don't even understand what "market cap" means.
There is absolutely no reason to expect Bitcoin price to increase based solely on "market cap" because that's not how a currency works.
A government doesn't just issue a currency and suddenly it's worth the all world GDP.
You have gold being used for thousands of years now, and it still doesn't even follow closely the world GDP variations.
So why the hell would Bitcoin price have to increase just because the world GDP is much higher than the total market cap of Bitcoin?

I bought a Jupiter miner (Which I already sold for a profit) with some friends that knew little of bitcoin but heard it was a good investment.
We kept the money of the sale and they kept their BTC in BitStamp.
So, I just received messages from 2 of them saying: "Have you seen what happened? Can you please cash out the BTC  I have in Bitstamp quickly to your bank account since they didn't verify my account yet?"
This is what average Joe is thinking right now or will think as soon as they hear the news... so take your own conclusions.

The delude themselves with "to the moon" scenarios every time they have a rise in price (even if it's clearly manipulated like the one in the last 24h) even tough the price whent down a lot more just last month.
They think in their heads, that Bticoin is ready for prime time although they keep getting robbed from people computer wallets, online wallets, exchanges, banks, shops and mining pools.
The poor sheeple mistake **unaccountability** for **anonymity** and will never change their views, until their are left bag holding when the government imposes draconian regulation or when the rest of the world completely looses interest and drives the price to low double digits.
Only then, the few that actually want to use Bitcoin as a currency like it was always intended to be, and not as a highly speculative commodity, will take charge and be able to fix the crap they are building for themselves.
Until then you and I will just get down voted for asking or telling the truth.

Dude, everyone in this subreddit knows you are not supposed to use your BTC. You are just supposed to keep it in cold storage until it reaches 1 billion USD.

Because his conception of "troll" is not necessarily someone that is trolling. His conception of troll is just someone that doesn't cheerlead for bitcoin even if by posting a completely reasonable opinion that goes against his wet dreams that 1 BTC will be worth 10000K USD by this year's end.

Love it how most of the shortcoming of "cash" are just the shortcomings of the backwards banking system you have in the US.
Most of the stuff you point as shortcoming of cash, can be done immediately and much safely by our bank internet page here in Europe that you can do it with bitcoin.
* Internal bank transfers: Price= Free. Time = Immediate. Can be done by Internet, Phone, ATM or at the bank.
* External bank transfers to any country of the EU and Schengen Space: Price = Free. Time = 24h. Can be done by Internet, Phone, ATM or at the bank.
* Opening a bank account: Show up at a bank with your ID card or do it from Home using the integrated ID system if you have an ID card reader. Price=Free. Time=Immediate
* Withdraw Money: Price=Free. Available at any ATM machine or bank (Compare this with Bitcoin).
* Want to pay for a big amount of cash: **Do a bank transfer!** What kind of ridiculous argument was that, that I need to withdraw loads of cash and carry them with me? Are you for real?
* Want to pay for something from a banned country? Why the hell I would want this? And **why** the hell you pay for something from a banned country with bitcoin if you cannot receive it back in the mail? Do you even know how an embargo works? Jesus you are so clueless about the world.
No wonder this subbreddit is going to hell. With fanboys like you spitting their distorted view about the world, of course this is full with crap.

I didn't had issues. I have BTC there but I didn't try to take it out.
But I saw many ppl stressing on Trading View that their withdrawal wasn't processed.
So yeah, I read the statement and became clear some people where spreading rumors. BitStamp is not processing all the withdrawals like before, the came up with a patch and are testing with some costumers, checking manually and believe they will implement it fully in the next days.
Thats what their announcement says... but very few ppl actually read it for what I see.

Now-a-days you have 2 ways of acquiring bitcoin (since for a normal person it's not doable to invest 10K in a mining rig).
Either you trade them personally... which moves the problem to another person that will be in the same situation.
Or you have to buy your BTC in an online exchange.
So, this title is ridiculous. How can bitcoin exist without exchanges if people need exchanges to acquire BTC?

- Just like some "poor folks" actually have to move (omg, the humanity of asking someone to stand and go to a bank) and you see that and an obvious fault in banking. Some other "poor folks" don't know how to use or don't even have access to the internet... but guess what, they can just go to a bank and make a wire transfer.
- Geez, so if after 6 months I need and old statement about a transaction, that I didn't actually stored, and if my bank is shitty enough not to provide that in the internet, I need AGAIN to move to a bank. This is insane, how can they ask people for this? This should be reported to the United Nations.
- OMG I have to provide documentation to open a bank account? How can this be possible? Why can't I just trasnfer money from my bank to my favorite arms dealer, not pay taxes for it and in case my bank defaults still be entitled to have the state securing a maximum of 100 000 € of my bank account without providing absolutely no personal information? This kind of behavior belongs to the middle ages.
- And why do I need to give someone my direct deposit info for them to send money to me? I mean, if I'm completely retarded and never in my life actually remembered to store my bank account number somewhere so that people are actually able to send money to me, still, why the hell do I have to go to a bank/go to an ATM machine/go to the internet/pick up a phone to get my bank account info. WHY CAN'T THEY GIVE PEOPLE MORE OPTIONS FOR THAT?

Looking at it, it's like you are bursting a bubble. Complain how much you like, but right now is exactly what it seems. So, better wait and see if this wasn't really a bubble and the prices start increasing again. If they do, they have a lot to gain, if it doesn't wait until the bubble bursts and the slow but steady uptrend resumes.
Also, I wouldn't recommend Bitcoin to someone that is not computer savvy. They would just probably get robbed they way things are right now. Bitcoin needs way better security in order to become mainstream.

I don't think you got the news yesterday.
On 15th (or 18th... China is so crazy that things change all the time). Banks cannot process BTC anymore and that's the deadline to put/withdraw money from the exchanges.
On the 14th. Houbi and BTC China will stop that, but they have plans to implement some vouchers (I didn't really understand what they mean by that, someone can clarify?), to allow people to deposit and withdraw money.
Of course this seems (at least to Westerners) a blatantly work around the regulation, so I would be surprised if in the future, when it suits the big money guys there, China re-re-re bans BTC again (or these voucher schemes).

Bitcoin is a currency, not a way to stash money and speculate. That was always the original intention and proposition from Satoshi Nakamoto and his white paper: 
The purpose of Bitcoin is to be used to buy/sell stuff with no regard to the exchange value. Like some products already do that and put a fixed Bitcoin value for it's goods no matter what is the exchange rate: (i.e.

Some people in TradingView are suggesting that Gox is doing this in order to be able to buy cheap coins on the other exchanges and have enough BTC to process the coming withdrawals in BTC. And then to make some money to themselves when people are forced to buy the coins back at Gox at higger prices and with the fiat they have stuck there while driving the prices up even more.
Don't know, seems a bit of a conspiration theory, but then again, it also makes some sense.

1. No, it works like this. The government of China has an official conversion rate and they trade to anyone inside or outside China for that conversion rate.

There is a big, big problem in BTC and that is the complete lack of accountability. Someone can hack, cheat the market, steal BTC and nothing, absolutely nothing happens to the perpetrator.
That issue must be addressed or BTC will quickly loose the interest of public opinion. And a bunch of bearded guys saying the contrary are just that: a bunch of bearded guys that have no notion of the reality and of the real society that exists outside their computers.
Think about it. Would you recommend your parents to store their assets in BTC? I sure as well wouldn't, they would probably be stolen in a matter of days.
Even very technical savvy people (and sites as we've seen just now with SilkRoad) get stolen. How can this be the "currency of the future" this way?

But that's the thing. Normal people expect security first.
People had malware in their computers forever. Yet, they still use VISA/PayPal online and the percentage of stealing is much lower than with bitcoin. Because there are security/legislation in place to protect them. Even if they cannot trust their computer. Malware infection rates are in the order of 10% now, and they are actually increasing.
Just an historical note: Fiat was protected since day one of it's invention in ancient China because it was legally just a legal tender for an amount of some precious commodity (usually gold) and as such inherited the same legal protection as such. In most places it's not legal tender anymore, but the laws and protections where already in place by the time it ended.

It can just go all the way down all the time.
Besides, the news is still unconfirmed, nobody still showed the PBOC statement.
If it's false news, expect a rebound to previous levels like it happen last week.
If it's true it will go down until the 15th of April... it's just impossible that it doesn't go with so many people selling and so much money being taken out of the game.
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:50:35
Why does this has to have any influence on the price either way?
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:05:14
Look, it's simple.
This news is about a statement from PBOC. Yet, strangely, no one can find and show that statement.
Don't you find this a bit strange? A major bank entity releases such an important statement but no one can actually show it?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:56:09
Sure, it carries exactly the same legal risk, physical risk and potential profit as what you just said obviously.

That doesn look like a market order. It seems like a fixed price order.
Let's say the minimum bid is 590 with a volume of 5 and you want to sell 10. You can still put a limit sell for 10 at 580 and buy all the way from 590 until the minimum of 580 @ 10 BTC volume.

This forum is just a circlejerk about how the price will rise to the Moon.
Posts about interesting stuff are downvoted if they point something that needs fixing and put aside if they don't imply the price will sky rocket.
News are upvoted or downvoted, not on their truthfulness and interest, but on how they are good or bad for the price.
This all subreddit became a place for fanboys that think that the 0.1 BTC they mined with the electricity of their parents will one day make them rich.
There is zero healthy discussion here, and it didn't start because of non bitcoin believers, it started because any time someone voices a contrary opinion or dared question if the price rising so quickly was acceptable, or dared put in question the rampant theft of personal wallets or un reliance of the BTC exchanges, they where bashed to hell.
I came here believing in BTC after talking and meeting some sensible people and their sensible views about the matter, but after seeing the sad thing that the bitcoin community really is, I'm loosing all my faith this social experiment will ever succeed in the midst of so much stupidity.
So basically, what goes around, comes around.

Or at least please direct us to a post you made about bitcoin that concerns anything other than the price.
I searched you history and I can't find 0 threads in wish actually you contributed to this subreddit in a positive and mildly unbiased way.
Now, look at my history, me that I'm a troll. And check how many posts I have about interesting things about bitcoin and it's technology.
In fact, me, **the troll** contributed a lot more to than you. So your criteria to call someone "troll" is simply one: Trolls are anyone in here that it's not cheer leading solely to the price of bitcoin and actually see flaws in bitcoin that should be addressed in order for it to succeed.

Sure, because the obvious fact that you can take money out of your bank 24/7 in any ATM machine is obviously a juvenile and anti bitcoin comment. Also is the fact you can use you bank card 24/7 to pay in most shops.
And yeah, also mentioning that most bank now-a-days have a web platform that you can use from home to carry out transactions and pay your bills at any time is obviously another juvenile anti-bitcoin comment.
Bottom line: That thread is ridiculous and a complete distortion of the truth. This is the XXI century and guess what, between ATM machines and internet, people can also use their banks all the time, so yeah, it got downvoted.

The wording of this article is very wrongly put.
BTC prices have increased since it's inception. So what the article is actually saying is that the price getting higher doesn't affect hoarding.
But it can't counter pose that fact simple because there was never an extended period in which the price kept going lower, so there is no data to show that.

So, you want bitcoin to be only accepted in the black market?
Of course you have to report your profit to the IRS, anyone that makes profit with bitcoin, gold, selling puppies is supposed to report to the IRS and pay taxes over it.
This is a good thing, it says: **Hey, the USA government accepts bitcoin as legal, but if you make money of of it, you have to pay taxes**.
Compare that to the China alternative where you never know where it lies it's legal status.
@_date: 2014-04-13 02:27:18
So, this means that if BTC crashes hard and looses all it's value, nobody will have nay incentive to come up with some better crypto currency better that can actually be accepted as a currency by everyone.

With current regulations (or lack of them to be exact), even if you could track the stolen bitcoins, you would have two problems (that I can think of immediately).
The probability of them being in your country, or your area of jurisdiction being very thin.

So much people here are all about *killing the messenger*. They just allow good news about bitcoin, even if they have to censor the bad ones.
So, yeah, I can understand TBI. If I was in his place, I would wait until the price raised, then sell my BTC, tell some close friends, dump the news, and buy them back for a much lower price. Because let's face... that's what the majority of the people here deserve.

That was sarcasm. Let me put it so that you can understand: When you say a completely ridiculous stuff that's nothing more than an uninformed personal opinion like the OP just said and it's against BTC everyone here just cries FUD. If instead you say a completely ridiculous stuff that's nothing more than an uninformed personal opinion like the OP just said but it's pro BTC then everyone here up votes it and thinks it's fine and makes perfect sense.
That's why many people here just lost thousands of USD in MtGox. Suits them nicely.

Seriously, some people are insane. Bitcoin is valuable, and MtGox needs money to pay what's owed.
Unfortunately creditors don't accept BTC as payment, so yeah, of course MtGox will have to exchange those BTC for money and pay what is due.
Seriously, what is the alternative? It's like you people live in a parallel Universe where reality is a different thing or something.
P.S. - Yes, I'm waiting for the downvotes, but of course, no one will even suggest any reasonable alternative to the obvious, they will just keep living in their fantasy world.

2. Downvote and report all the bad news, even if they are from confirmed sources.
3. Every time the price comes up more than 10$ write *"To the Moon"* in every thread.
4. Every time you see bad news you are supposed to downvote it yourself and make a comment stating that *"This is actually good news"*.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:34:12
Not going to happen. The bitcoin community (at least on Reddit) mistakes anonymity with complete lack of accountability. So they will always oppose against something that can prevent theft/manipulation/hacking... simply because enforcing anonymity so strongly, makes it impossible to fix that.
I actually believed in Bitcoin, until some idiots came and ruin the party for everyone simply because there where absolutely no repercussions.
But there is no way to put that into the head of the people that actually can take any sort of decisions about BTC.

Also, you are the second person to suggest it may be some javacript injection. Well, if it was, that meant the localbitcoins page is very insecurely designed. There are many ways to prevent that from happening from the programmer side and I would be quite surprised if the guys from localbitcoins didn't protect their services for javascript injection vulnerabilities.
Then again, after the XSS exploit fiasco, one would hope the guys at LocalBitoicns actually secured the code:
I'm still pointing towards some bug with the wallets and that this will be solved on Monday... when someone from Localbitcoins finally answers the support tickets.
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:07:08

The wallet remained the same since then. I saw 3 different wallets, then at least since I asked it to create a new wallet address, the wallet address remained the same.
I already checked my system for malware (there is no know malware that does anything like what it happened, specially on the mac, but I was still running chkrootkit and the system is clean). Also, I'm on a mac (but I still have an antivirus scanning web and files permanently, and the malware filters from adblock on) and this kept happening in different browsers.
Whatever it was, it seems to have come from LocalBitcoins side.

I see your past posts and I see you are nothing but a mindless fan boy.
You simply cannot understand that:
1 - Just because people are not cheer leading for bitcoin, hiding the bad news and crying "To the Moon" every time the price goes up 10$ after coming down 50$, they are not trolls, just are just sane.
2 - Bitcoin is not about the price, it's about an underlying technology and that's what matters to the bitcoin purists. Someone that really believes in Bitcoin would be completely against Square integration and completely excited with the applications the Blockshain can have for online Democracy and voting.
Yet, you don't talk about the real issues and strengths of Bitcoin, you only care about the stupid price.
So, you my friend, you are the troll here.

- You are actually stating that someone that doesn't want (or actually doesn't know) how to set up a separate secure system just to handle their bitcoins is just lazy. Do you think your grandpa and grandma are "just lazy" or perhaps your sister even? Or do they all know to setup a system to do this?

How the hell is that the currency of the future? Stashed away forever while some nerdy deluded kids hope the 0.1 BTC they mined with their parent electricity, reaches 1 million?
Support is decreasing, not increasing, and that's because everyone that's not a fanboy has already seen how the bitcoin community handles the messes it creates. Shuts their eyes and pretend that by ignoring the problems they just disappear.
The way this is now, it's never, ever going to be mainstream, nobody in their right mind will invest their savings in something that can be stolen from them so easily with absolutely no accountability to the robbers.
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:27:51
Problem is that in order for this to happen (like the guy says his lawyer told him to do), you have to convert all your BTC at Gox into USD.
So, in the end, even of Gox gives them the money back, Gox is keeping a huge profit. Karpeles will be laughing in the end.

It was also obvious manipulation how the price as risen for the last days.
Everything in this market it's manipulated, so either you embrace BTC for what they are and stop paying attention to the price, or you must join the wagon and sell at moments like this and then re-buy at the appropriate times.

I really hope you can get your money back man!
From now on try to at least keep your coins in an exchange that at least is accountable under the law of where you are.
In USA: Kraken
In EU: Bitstamp, BTCe
They may have their problems, but at least they will be under your country jurisdiction in case something goes really wrong.
Don't trust stuff in China like Houbi or BitFinex... they are in China for a reason and they can just disappear with your money and you can't do anything about it.
In any case, being Gox in Japan in case they don't give your money back you should search for people in your situation and collectively sue them in Japan... it's expensive, but there are a lot of people with lots of money there, so just stick together.
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:31:01
That's not what it says.
Basically the PBOC official just confirmed the ban, but he clarified that the ban is on banks from transferring money to/from bitcoin exchanges. The ban is not on the people from owning bitcoin.
I though that was clear from the beginning. I don't think even North Korea could ban people from owning bitcoin, that would be impossible.

What about a big fck you?
Whenever some system goes down, the small ones should be the 1st ones getting protected, not the last ones you bigot.
Makes me smile idiots like you will never get your 50 BTC back, not even 5 BTC worth of it.
And no, before you start wondering I have no BTC at MtGox... unlike you that had 50BTC, I was not dumb enough to keep them there.
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:38:22
That's a fallacy. If the price at which people are ready to buy with confidence is below the current price, then the reasoning is that when people start buying at the lower price, once it reaches the present price, people will stop buying.

Ok, let put aside all your obvious ignorance about economics.
Even if it wasn't for basic economic principles, where did you want us to keep our money? Under our mattresses?

The support came down during the night, not all at once.
Yesterday you had about 25K BTC from 410 to 400 on Stamp. They got eaten, they didn't get pulled out.

Another one bites the dust.

I see the fear is setting in. Donwvote as much as you want little ones... I'm getting the money from fan boys like you by shorting bitfinex like hell.
Remember, your downvotes of reality keep my bank account happy.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:02:31
Yeah, it's possible. I mean, there are many possible scenarios (they all involve Dropbox, but there are many different ways to access it). That's why I asked for the access IP addresses to the Dropbox account, but, when they refused to give them and after reading this news that their employes have access to the contents of our accounts, I started to get suspicious.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:17:48
What I meant is that 4 BTC is peanuts for them, there are much bigger fish to catch.
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:06:12
But Truecrypt is for full disk encryption. Do you mean I can use it to just encrypt my Dropbox folder/account?
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:19:18
Better yet, don't use BTC, ever, that way it will never get stolen.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:51:25
I didn't know that (I don't know much of law), but yeah, like you said, the attorney fees in the US would probably not make it worth the 4 BTC I lost :/
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:01:19
Maybe your mother left you fall on the head when you where born. Oh well, guess we'll never be 100% sure about one or the other.
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:08:20
It was a 1password file. Pass was 9 alpha, numbers and symbols.
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:11:27
It could, but it could easier be a Dropbox employee, since like wired reported, they do have access to the contents of your account: 
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:37:35
Well, my hard drive is encrypted and I don't leave the computer logged in (not because of passwords, but because I never leave the computer unattended since I'm afraid it can be stolen).
Also, no, I don't have a key logger. This is Mac OS, it's running an Anti Virus (Avast), it's running a Firewall (Little Snitch) and I paranoidly went trough the disk searching for any keylogger, login items and services, running root access checkers and the computer is clean.
Now, yes, it could be that someone saw me entering the password (not probable, but not impossible), but then this is exactly why I was asking Dropbox for the IP accesses... until they first started pretending they didn't understand what I was asking for and ended with them telling me they can't provide the info.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:19:23
The Dropbox password was a made up word, 9 chars, but only chars (I know, a bit weak). The files where quite good, 9 alphanumeric and symbols.
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:58:59
1st of all, learn to read the wallet wasn't unencrypted. 2nd, even if it was unencrypted someone still had to have access to the Dropbox account, so what does that even have to do with it?
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:21:38
That seems cool. I'll check it tomorrow.
I'm installing arkOS in a Raspberry Pi to have my personal cloud, but this could be a good sidekick to keep as well.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:24:15
Err. I had 4 BTC stolen. Now, 4000$ (the value at the time) it's quite a lot of money to me, but if the NSA needs to steal this amount of money to run, we can all rest assured that their activities will not last much longer and we will soon be free from their spying.
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:00:37
You do realize that 1Password, Blockchain info (and probably other wallets), do suggest you keep these files in Dropbox, don't you?
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:49:41
Good that you don't have coins n that wallet. But remember that even if you had the original wallet encrypted, if you had that unencrypted wallet backup lying around, it would still be possible to transfer the coins you had in there.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:31:37
ArkOS it's open source.
It's a personal cloud with all the services it implies that you can run in a Raspberry Pi. I actually bought the R Pi to install arkOS to setup a web server, but now after this I'm going to use it as a Dropbox alternative.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:33:05
I thought 9 alpha, numbers and symbols was basically impossible to crack. 
But yeah, I'm now changing all my passwords with LastPass password generator for ones with much higher complexity.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:30:11
Also true... a good thought to keep my sanity intact :D
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:34:16
I see. I'll stick with ArkOS and use TrueCrypt in any other services like this.
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:59:32
No, I wasn't.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:19:26
Guys, it was encrypted! But the needed info came from a password list file (also encrypted before you ask) that was in the Dropbox account.
I know this because there would be the only way for them to access both my wallet and my Bitstamp wallet (there was almost nothing there, but it was a machine generated password that was used only there and nowhere else).
Now, yeah, in some way they could have found that password (for the file), but even in the worst case scenario, the hacker would still need to access the Dropbox account.
And about not giving the IP... it's my account, I want to know who entered there. Google gives that info automatically for instance, so let's not make this a "data protection" issue because it's not.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:19:33
It's on but the prices are crazy. They are going down while there was a difference of 20% with MtGox.
They should pick up later imo. So time to buy now and sell when they approach MtGox again.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:18:28
The wallet WAS encrypted. And I thought a mix of 9 chars, numbers and symbols was quite strong (I see now it's not that strong after all).
In any case the real issue remains... the Dropbox account WAS accessed. If it was access by a Hacker, a Dropbox employee, the NSA or Santa Claus is what I want to know, but I can't since Dropbox refuses to tell the IP addresses that logged into the account.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:06:02
Yeah, I think it's for the best. Now I'm so paranoid that I keep the new wallet in a separate encrypted partition where I installed Linux just for keeping the wallet and the only backup I keep it's the wallet seed (I'm using electrum) printed on a paper.
I think it's basically impossible to access my wallet that way... unless someone steals my computer, brutforces the encryption of my hard drive AND brutforces the password of the wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:28:53
Yes, I'm making a complaint to the police of course, but the IP address of who entered my account it's not protected by anything. Google gives it right away, so does Bitstamp/MtGox (not sure which).
I'm thinking about making a micro payment to the stolen addresses with a link to the police report. Perhaps it's worth the try.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:48:25
Well, you are right, but now it's too late for that. But I'm never trusting Dropbox again for anything slightly sensitive. I'm now running Bittorrent Sync for a while until the Raspberry Pi where I'm going to install arkOS arrives: 
Then I'm completely free from Dropbox.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:03:17
Interesting I wasn't aware arkos used bittorrent sync for the file could service.
Do you have any suggestion for an open source alternative?
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:41:01
Like I said in another reply. I run Mac OS exclusively, I have Avast anti-virus installed and Little Snitch Firewall.
The OS was installed fresh about 1 month ago (Mavericks), I've searched for all the login logs and services, run a rootkit checker and nothing.
The computer it's clean, it would be simpler to just get the file from Dropbox and bruteforce it, after all, knowing it was a BTC wallet, it meant it had a great potential to hold money so there would certainly be enough interest to take the time to crack the encryption.
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:57:29
Well, that's the point. These are not random companies, they are quite well known in their branch of activity.
So, yeah I trusted their advise, lost my BTC, regretted it and now know better, but you can't expect people go in their life distrusting everything around them without some reason.
But the original issue remains. Someone accessed my Dropbox account to steal the bitcoins, and for some reason Dropbox doesn't want to disclosure that data.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:35:24
It was encrypted.
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:03:10
I just enter the pass key to each folder I added in 1 computer in another one and it works fine for me, even using it from the outside.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:12:09
Oh, I said I was using it now, but just as a temporary solution (it has many kinks to iron out but I always thought it was open source).
Thank for the ownCloud link seems quite similar to arkOS I'll check it out.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:40:17
I'm not a resident of the USA, I'm from EU. So, I don't think an attorney here can subpoena the logs from there.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:44:46
Yes, I'm going to use my own server now (based on an open source system of course)... oh well, a lesson for life.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:12:50
Well, I'm not going to use it to put any BTC related info in Dropbox.
In fact I've decided I'm keeping that relevant info in printed form only from now on.
But of course. I'm a bit apprehensive about other forms of info that can be stolen from an online account (ID info and that sort of stuff), but being TrueCrypt an open source project it should be good enough for that. I'm really not paranoid at all by nature... this was the 1st time I got burned from it tough, so I'll be selectively paranoid about BTC only from now on :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:08:31
Yes. I completely accept it might have been someone else entering Dropbox and that's exactly why I asked for the IP addresses.
But there is no way this could have happened without access to the Dropbox account. Because the needed information to perpetrate the bitcoin theft didn't exist anywhere else.
Anyway, I'm also telling my friends to do new wallets and to save the original seeds in a printed sheet instead of keeping any wallet backup.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:33:03
On a side note, what's people problem with ArkOS? Every post about it it's down voted.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:50:28
Like I said, it was encrypted... and now, the new one it's super-paranoidly encrypted.
