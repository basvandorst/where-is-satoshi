5th grade economics aside, how is there not equal access to participate in mining? There is no Bitcoin czar or corporation...in the beginning anyone with a computer could join in. Obviously, the hardware to mine has become much more sophisticated and expensive, nonetheless, anyone can mine without any sort of title transfer.
Title transfer is the key point. 
I am in no way saying "Stock markets are socialist because everyone can buy stocks."  Stocks are units of private ownership. 
The Bitcoin network seems to act more like a collective co-op whereas bitcoin the monetary unit has strict private property rights/title. 
If you want to browse something, it should be the difference between voluntary &amp; coercive socialism. 
I'm not an advocate of socialism by its usual connotation  anyway, so wtf are we arguing about?
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:37:32
You shouldn't have a lot of coin in an online account, secure cold storage isn't THAT hard to do.
But, A good first step for companies like Coinbase would be the ability for the user to set very hard limits on daily account withdrawals, so at lease there is SOME warning of a compromised account.
You're still boned if some "regulatory body" decides to shut down your online service for whatever reason...remember e-gold?

I don't see the point in trying to debate Peter on Bitcoin he obviously hasn't done the research on it to understand why this invention is something much more important than a tulip bulb speculation. I can't say that I blame him,  it does take a real time commitment, especially for the non-tech savvy to really get a glimpse into the genius of the protocol. I do hope at some point someone like Jon Matonis or Eric Voorhees will have the opportunity to calmly walk Peter through it, if he is ever so inclined.

We'll it's a mighty big topic indeed, I don't profess to be an expert on every nuance. You may (if you haven't already) explore the writings of the free market economists like Mises, Hayek, Friedman etc. 
The 'paradox of thrift' doesn't seem to ring true in the tech sector(the freest market we have), which leads me to believe that it's a fallacy...
I agree that hoarding is the only sensible move right now(for those of us that believe that Bitcoin has real value), but that is only a consequence of this "early adoption" phase that were in with markets coming to terms with the true value of Bitcoin, not necessarily because Bitcoin is deflationary or that a deflationary monetary system is bad per se.
To put it simply, when Bitcoin grows up and the true market value is discovered, it will be freely traded for goods &amp; services just like a gold standard would. A person may have all the gold in the world but that doesn't do him much good if he needs shoes, food, or a bed to sleep in. You can't hoard forever! 
@_date: 2013-10-29 11:49:52
The OP's original assertion is incorrect. Fiat, obviously, can be created at will. BUT so can gold, it's just not economically feasible to do so yet. If the world were on a gold standard, you can imagine the tech evolving to the point where gold was mined at an elemental level increasing supply. There will ONLY EVER be 21 million bitcoins (a hard, fixed amount).
Where did you dream up the 1.1% interest rate? The interest rate, in real economics, serves the very useful function of coordinating production across time and is a value that should be determined by the free market.
[If every bitcoin holder wanted to lend the interest rate would be driven to 0....supply/demand]

His "intrinsic value" argument is nonsense. Take away the monetary value of gold, and we have a nice little metal good for making false teeth, jewelry and some relatively minor industrial uses.
Bitcoin is a genius breakthrough in computer science, I'd call that "intrinsic value" of a much higher order.

Two points to consider:
1) Bitcoin gets value from the infrastructure/network. How valuable would a single cell phone be without its corresponding network? 
2) Bitcoin gets value precisely for its "intangibility" and ease of mobility. Something the gold bugs should consider.

The OP's original question is flawed. One person cannot lend out 21M BTC because that would assume that that person owned the sum total of bitcoins. 
If one person owned all the bitcoins what value would it have?  
Answer: NONE.
A currency depends, in part, in widely accepted use/distribution and price stability. Bitcoin isn't there yet, which I think is what is causing the confusion...

I mean "economy" in the context of a nation state, like the dollar economy in the USA. The people doing the "deeming worthy" are the citizens. 
I was just trying to explain (perhaps not well!) the difference between the economic implications of a deflationary monetary system vs an inflationary one. 
Edit: Under the gold standard (deflationary) the US government was a trivial part of entire economy (5%?) . If  citizens wanted more "services" the cost was born directly (if you want roads &amp; schools, send us money). Under the current inflationary system costs for "services" the electorate have not necessarily consented to are born through the hidden tax of inflation, which is the most regressive tax imaginable...
