I agree entirely

This is precisely what it is. Skepticism that leads to laziness... when another year passes they’ll stay stuck in that ignorance as well. I was 8 years late until April 2017.. initially heard about btc and cryptocurrency back in Spring of 2014 when I came across the bitcoin pizza story. ITS NOT TOO LATE

He’s an eccentric and paranoid old head but you can’t deny he’s not real af about what he simply believes? And he most likely is high as a kite but he firmly believes in the success of bitcoin and believes it is going to reach $1million, so what? I’d rather hear about him rather than a paranoid Christian who claims the times are coming to an end because “times are so evil with the shootings” or you know the ones that firmly believe a man walked on water millennia ago as if they were there to witness such a miracle. Because this exact time last year I literally told everyone that I firmly believe bitcoin would reach $10k at minimum before the year 2017 ended. And everyone including my own mother looked at me and told me I was ludicrous. I’m not a genius nor am I 100% knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies as a whole. But I simply assessed the benefits of btc and saw what makes it superior to banks/physical cash and wouldn’t be surprised if btc reaches $100k+ in the next decade. I’ve been buying since April 2017. My Facebook messenger and texts started to blow TF up when everyone heard on the news that btc had for the first time reached $10k over winter.. and then we saw it hit $20k within a month from that. So for what it’s worth, maybe just some of us have unexplainable insight on the future and we hope for the best. My only argument or pet-peeve, is when I see/hear someone say bitcoin is dead. Like you people who make such ignorant claims have no clue what its price was this exact date last year, which was approx- $1800-2800c let alone how lone btc has even been around. 
So sit the fuck down. HODL!!
Or just sit back and hate from the nose bleeds because it’s redundantly pointless now for any of the haters and nonbelievers.

I thought that I might be mixed up with some of the info. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:54:58
Do your research you’ll find there are quite a lot of ways to use it. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:42:17
Well said.

My favorite fact of it all is the media and skeptics were all saying “it’s a bubble”  when bitcoin originally had reached an ATH of $3000usd in August of 2017..and then we all saw it reach $20k shortly after..so what it’s went down from that. It went down to $6k in February and then would go back up to $12k within weeks and yes we are back down to $6k yet again, but consider the Dec/Jan boom as a sudden sprint that bitcoin took for the first time in years without any conditioning prior and now these downs and ups are just heavy breaths after the sprint. And the next sprint will be for the gold medal this year, next year, or someday in the next decade without a doubt in my mind I’m not saying btc will in fact be equivalent to $1million one day but I do most certainly believe in it’s potential to reach above $100k. due to the trends of it’s exponential growth in the past decade. It is an odd analogy I know but I don’t see any roller coaster memes much these days. All we await for is a brilliant mind to figure out a simple way to make security habitual and easy to utilize on a smart phone that has blockchain technology default on smart phones sort of like Apple Pay. When that day comes and consumer stores like Walmart  implement the tech we will look back on these days and wonder why we even sweated a drop. And maybe I am wrong entirely but that’s a partial bit of my vision with it all

Precisely. The idea that people can seriously say “bitcoin is dead” even at this point proves to me how much research there has been a lack of. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:23:20
Simple sarcasm 
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:21:01
That is for btc btw 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:59:28
Guys... I’ve got it figured out. Let’s just form a group and start burning $USD’s. We can even record the burning and the movement will trend towards crypto as a whole and if we trend enough we’ll get paid for views��

“World government’s”... Japan is entirely with the crypto movement. Therefore they’re not all united on “killing” crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:38:18
And on this exact date last year 1 bitcoin was worth between $1000-1100...
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:18:28
I agree. Pointless statement if some random is giving an analysis. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:09:35
Complete sarcasm 
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:20:45
Good question. I don’t imagine we will see a drop below 7k again though 
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:14:02
Holy shit he killed this
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:35:58
��I thought of this once 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:54:49
������he/she probably knows so much about bitcoin as well
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:34:46
And how much debt is America in again����so how the hell do you presume America is going to “kill” bitcoin, ole Donny trump I guarantee has a couple hundred bitcoin’s stowed away..

Respect the truth. And this is truth, it is vandalism. And just pitifully done at that lol
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:30:08
“Yeah bitcoin is soooooooo dead” 
“Something a fucking moron says”-what I say.
