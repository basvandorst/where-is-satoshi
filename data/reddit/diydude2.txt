It's impossible.  On what grounds would they do it?  It would be struck down by the courts in record time.  Banning Bitcoin would effectively mean banning all of contract law and the free market itself.  
Zimbabwe banned Bitcoin.  As a result, Bitcoin is much more expensive in Zimbabwe than in most countries.  
As for regulation -- I'm not necessarily against it, but it might not be feasible if Bitcoin adoption got to the point of threatening the dollar.  It is quasi-anonymous, after all. People sending it to each other peer-to-peer without signing up for accounts would make it pretty hard to spy on.
But the U.S. government attempting to ban Bitcoin would have two main effects:  1) It would drive the price to insane levels and 2) There would be a huge drain of wealth from the U.S. as  Bitcoiners moved to greener pastures.  The outcome of such an attempt would be failure: too much money in the space now.  Courts would shoot it down.

It's parabolic right now.  Most people just don't realize where it is on the parabola.  Imagine a parabola with a range from [-100, 100] on the "x" axis.  The peak of the parabola is at 0.  
What you want to do is sell (some, never all) somewhere between x=-10 and x=10.  Right now we're at about x=-80.  
If you have a lot of Bitcoin and want to hedge, you can sell a tiny bit when there is a big run up and buy back when it falls back, but it doesn't always fall back from where you think it will.  Sometimes it keeps going up for a while so only play those trades with a small percentage of your hodlings.
Parabolas start rising slowly and gain steam (2x2=4, 2x4=8, 2x8=16... 2x512=1024).  We're still near the beginning of this one.  Don't sell.

You are mistaken.  The government does not have anything to do with fiat.  Bankers control fiat.  The government just happens to be their biggest customer, and we their slaves through our taxes.
The system whereby we pay the great grandchildren of creatures from Jekyll Island $500 billion per year simply because their granddaddy's bank lends to the government will come crashing down.  Bitcoin won't kill it -- that will be done through its own corruption, inequity and stupidity -- but it will replace it.

They would prefer to not have taxes taken out of their paychecks, to not have to file returns, and to not have to deal with the IRS.
They would prefer, I suppose:
* a small tax on financial transactions (Tobin tax)
* a VAT
* a legal Treasury-issued currency instead of the counterfeit private banker money the government has been borrowing from inbred psychopath bankers since 1913
among other things. It will be a very easy sell.

How about we make a sane tax system that doesn't intrude on people's privacy, doesn't involve paying a bunch of government goons to enforce it?  Like, when you buy gas, you pay a tax on it that helps fund road construction.  When you buy property, you pay a small tax on that every year to fund schools and police.  When you trade securities, you pay a small tax on each transaction.  This system sucks.  I have no problem paying taxes.  I do have a problem paying $500 billion per year in interest on money that the government borrows from the biggest criminals on the planet -- bankers -- when it should just print it itself.

No, we only dipped to 3200 because everyone was buying, and when the one dumbass selling all the borrowed Bitcoin ran out and had to pay it back, he lost his ass.  Seems to want to do it again.
Just six weeks ago we were struggling and dealing with dumps, trying to break through 8K.  SIX WEEKS AGO.  This will be the same.  At some point, we will blast back through 10K, keep going, and never look back.

Exactly.  TA is designed for traditional markets with a whole different set of data points to consider.  In crypto markets it is largely useless, although a few basic formations are useful.  Rounded tops usually mean a dip is coming and vice versa for rounded bottoms.  The price tends to move in the opposite direction of wicks.  Other than that, it's largely a waste, and even those indicators don't work a lot of the time.
TA is a tool, but it's the wrong tool for the job of predicting crypto price movements.  It's like trying to use a hack saw to make a precision cut on a circuit board.

No, it's like making $10,000 a month, paying $4,000 of that away in taxes, and getting $3000 worth of services in exchange because you're paying around $1000 in interest (when you include state and municipal debt) which goes directly in the pockets of parasites who have never had to work a day in their lives because their great granddaddies founded the Fed.

As time goes on, on-chain Bitcoin transactions will only be used for enormous amounts of money.  Smaller amounts will be transferred by alts or second layer, although eventually even second layer will not be desirable as people will want to hold on to every Satoshi.

The on ramp for Bitcoin is me sending it to whomever wants it.  In a world where the ATM networks are down, people will want it. Bitcoin is not some stock that I need to order through a broker or buy on an exchange. It's peer-to-peer cash that I can send to you by scanning your phone in the bar.  Or I can send it to you on the other side of the world in an instant and very cheaply. It is guaranteed to become far more valuable in the next economic crash because in that case there are only two possible scenarios:
1) Another government bailout which will slaughter the dollar's value and cause people all over the world to flee the dollar (many of them to Bitcoin)
2) No bailout, bankrupt banks and financial brokerages. ATM and credit card networks down.  Bitcoin still works.
In either case, Bitcoin wins.
If you think we're not headed for another crash, take a look at what has happened to corporate debt over the past ten years. It dwarfs what happened in the mortgage market in the 'aughts.  Basically every bank went bankrupt but for government bailouts in 2008.  The underlying problem (cheap money and too many crazy derivatives written on it) has gotten worse since then, not better.
Just curious: Have you ever owned or used Bitcoin?  
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:53:17

Bigger picture -- use exchanges only to buy.  Send your coins off-exchange as soon as they arrive in your wallet.  The exchange has to replenish the coins that are sent away.  Over time, this will cause the price to rise.

Do you know what "=" means?  Both ways are correct, but they express slightly different meanings.
So if you said, "What is 4 apples?"  I might answer, "4 apples is 2 apples + 2 apples, or 3 apples + 1 apple."  To say, "4 apples is 2 apples + 2 apples" would be technically correct, but incomplete.
If you say, "What is 2 apples + 2 apples," the only correct answer is "4 apples."

By the time mass adoption happens, Bitcoin will be very, very expensive. If the demand of a very small community of geeks (less than one percent of the population) makes 1 BTC = $6000, imagine what will happen when 5, 10, or 20 percent adopt.

There is a limited amount of BTC to be spread around through such transactions. 
Money itself is not valuable. It is only a way of keeping score. Can you not see that a mathematically/cryptographically secured ledger is a superior form of money? What do you think caused the financial collapse of 2008? Nobody knew WTF was really going on. Bitcoin was invented as a direct response to this.

Time is an illusion, a mere shadow of the 4th dimension.  All states of matter that can exist must exist.  Travel backward through "time" is entirely possible.  You encase a 3rd dimensional object in 4th dimensional reality then move it wherever you'd like in time.
CAVEAT: You'll never land on exactly the same timeline since there are an infinite number of states of matter, the passage through which in the 3rd dimension is perceived as time.  The illusion of time is that the states of matter you have experienced are the only ones that (you think)  exist (but in fact there are many others which you simply did not experience).
TLDR: In another universe, instead of reading this comment, you changed the state of matter by deciding to get up and pour a cup of coffee, thereby altering the course of history.

Bitcoin is cash. It will be utilized more widely as such in a crisis. I feel sorry for people who fail to grasp this because they're going to be standing in line to get their daily 50 bucks (which won't buy much) in the next crisis.
If you think this can't happen, ask people in Greece or Cyprus what happens when banks fail.  In 2008, banks failed. They were bailed out then, but next time they will likely be bailed in. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held in non-exchange-controlled wallets will not be affected.

To be fair, the Internet has done some of those things. The thing that's making the Internet suck now is that corporations have taken it over.  Back in the day, everybody had their own blog or website. People checked out each other's blogs, commented, linked to their friends' blogs, etc.  Now Fakebook and Reddit are the Internet.  They're censoring everything, shutting down voices they don't like.  It sucks. It's not human nature that made it suck; it's corporate greed and the same power structure that fills our brains with shit from the television.
We can turn this around, and I hope we do.  Things like Steemit and its attendant apps hold a lot of promise.  We can still put up our own websites without too much effort, too.  Once people turn on to what's being done to us (being monitored and data mined and censored and led around like sheep) we will reject Reddit and Fakebook and the rest of the corporate bullshit, censored Internet.  The free Internet still exists.  We will eventually figure out how to use it for good.
I believe that Bitcoin and the blockchain writ large will have even more profound effects than the Internet and that it will prove to be more difficult for TPTB to control given the peer-to-peer, decentralized nature of it.
Edit/add: As for AI, I wouldn't worry about it too much.  Intelligence is 100 percent natural.  What I'm worried about is fake "intelligence" being given the power to make decisions that belong in the realm of real intelligence.

History is moving faster now.  I'm sure the U.S. will continue to be economically and militarily significant in the world, but the global economy is not looking good. It won't just be the U.S., and we may be less affected than other countries (imagine the social implications of an economic implosion in China), but it will be very hard times for a lot of people.  
The problem with your "boom" decade is that it really wasn't that great.  Sure, the market went up, but that was primarily a function of corporations borrowing money cheaply and buying back their own shares.  If you thought the mortgage crisis of 2007-2008 was bad, wait until the corporate debt crisis blows up.  We've already had foreshocks -- General Electric, for example -- but there are a lot of companies who will have to face the music for their reckless borrowing and artificial share price inflation.  The numbers are all there.  Take a look at any company's debt-to-revenue ratio now vs. 10 years ago.  It should terrify you.

This is a major fallacy. Life is not a zero-sum game, and there is plenty to go around.  We are led to believe in scarcity, but the simple fact is that there is plenty for everyone.
If everyone had plenty and nobody had to worry about money, I bet there would still be restaurants and taxis and everything else.  The difference is that people would be doing those things for fun, or maybe to pick up a little extra money.  People are pretty amazing creatures, man. Don't underestimate us.

Lose now, lose later.
Just buy and hold. Either you understand the technology, the math, and the inevitability of Bitcoin's price rising over time, or you don't.
I was down 70 percent for much of 2014 and 2015. Now I'm up 2000 percent.
@_date: 2018-09-15 12:53:21
Yeah. I really feel sorry for people who are working their jobs and putting money in their retirement accounts like they're supposed to.  Many will lose their jobs, and those retirement accounts are going to get a lot smaller.

I'm just saying that the way people do TA here is strictly bush league compared to what can be done with Bloomberg terminal.
@_date: 2018-09-18 00:46:59
What do you think happened today and many times this year?  Today 35K BTC were dumped on various exchanges.  Net effect: meh.  The volume is $5 billion per day, seven days a week. 1K BTC is lunch money for some of the guys accumulating now.
What will really be funny is when the dumpers have to cover.  There is not much BTC for sale right now beyond what's being dumped.  Zoom out on the order book.  Bitfinex, one of the biggest spot exchanges, has about 10K BTC on offer between here and $10K.  If I were a bear who owed 40K BTC to cover my shorts, I'd be pretty scared right about now.

Bitcoin will go way higher than 100K.  It will see 100K next year.
There are still lambo gains to be made, but not for much longer. Lotta folks gonna be kicking themselves for not buying now.
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:00:40
I hope you're right because I've got a hodl buy lined up any day now. Some of that $1 billion in BTC that moved to exchanges may have been used to pay back BTC that was already borrowed from exchanges, don't you think?

Ding. Also you're a newb who doesn't even qualify as a hodler yet.
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:32:26
Why do you not consider "investing" a good description of buying and hodling Bitcoin? For a non-investment, it sure has some pretty phenomenal returns.
@_date: 2018-09-30 00:59:23
Banks or governments are not creating it.
@_date: 2018-09-15 12:48:25


You would seriously have to be retarded to even make this analogy.
This is not going to be a "recesssion," it's going to be a continuation of what began in 2001 or so with the issuance of money/debt to mitigate the dotcom crash.  The wound (bad debt propping up markets) was never healed (or even treated), it was made worse by quantitative easing.  
It's a good thing most people are totally ignorant, I guess.  If people knew how bad the corporate debt situation is (not to mention municipal debt, consumer debt, federal debt), everybody would freak out, sell everything, move to Montana and buy canned food and guns.  
I'm not even kidding.  It's bad.  Most people just don't know it yet.

@_date: 2018-09-11 14:33:55
It really is. I know you're being sarcastic, but once you've held and used Bitcoin for a couple years, it does seem like an extremely improved form of currency.

PayPal is shit. Bitcoin will replace it within two years.
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:29:57
Most of those people could afford the loans when they were made but could not afford them when interest rates rose.
In the past ten years, unfathomable amounts of money have been loaned to companies who then used the money to buy back their own shares, falsely inflating the market.  Apple alone owes $500 BILLION.  Interest rates are going up.  What do you think is going to happen when the same thing that happened to homeowners in 2008 happens to companies in 2018 or 2019? It's not going to be pretty. Get some Bitcoin and protect yourself.
@_date: 2018-09-17 00:56:36
TLDR -- smells like FUD and bullshit
@_date: 2018-09-28 15:56:44
Yeah, it's the future.  It will put Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and the rest out of business.

Nobody lost money unless they sold or bought within the past 10 months or so.  Actually, I'm up in dollar terms on my dip buys this year.
Tell your buddies to hodl. Everybody with big gains has bought and held through a bear market.  Everybody.  
@_date: 2018-09-30 14:28:17
Why would you need PayPal if you have Bitcoin? Have you ever used Bitcoin? It's easier and cheaper than PayPal without any middlemen. Bitcoin will slaughter PayPal just like e-mail slaughtered the fax machine.
@_date: 2018-09-14 16:55:06
Only if you SODL.
Everyone -- literally everyone -- who has big gains has bought and held through a bear market.  Ask anyone who was around in 2014-2015.
Edit: forgot to add -- at some point you'll be tempted to sell with a 100 percent gain.  Fine, but don't sell it all.  HODL applies when you have gains too.  Nothing worse than selling thinking you'll buy back cheaper then watching it double in a month.
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:48:44
2014 was worse.

Well, I sold my BTrash and Bitcoin Gold.  That was kind of like a dividend, a much bigger dividend than I ever got from a stock.  In the near future you'll be able to stake a Lightning channel and earn passive income from micro-transactions.

@_date: 2018-09-12 20:41:37
No it's not. Selling means getting dollars. Buying stuff means getting stuff for your Bitcoin. It's a great way to spread it. I've paid my lawyer, accountant, and lawn guy in Bitcoin. Guess what? They're all in the game now. 
Spending is the best way to increase adoption and ultimately raise the price.

Yeah, "bear market" or whatever, we're a lot closer to $20K than we were 12 months ago.
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:13:44
Yes, this is very important both for personal security and for the price.  When you send your coins off-exchange, the exchange has to buy back that amount to keep their books straight.  If everyone sent their coins off exchange at once, it would cause a massive upswing in price.
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:42:37
Exactly. Use Bitcoin to pay for stuff. That's the way. Just buy back what you spend.
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:43:46

Who says anyone needs to borrow?  Even if they do need to borrow, why should they do it from someone who doesn't even have the money? Do you think banks pull the money they lend out of their vaults? They don't. They pull it out of the Fed's ass.  That's the problem: it's inherently unfair and forces the masses to be debt slaves to a small class of bankers who have given themselves the legal right to create free money for themselves and expensive money for everyone else.
@_date: 2018-09-18 00:53:29
I agree.  I'm glad it didn't take off too fast and that these wonderful discounts have been offered.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:27:19
The ironic thing about this meme is that Bitcoiners are the only ones not losing everything. Holding dollars is a guaranteed way to lose your wealth. The markets are held together with band aids and paper clips at this point. If you don't have any BTC, you're a straight-up fool, and I pity you.
@_date: 2018-09-18 23:19:30
Really? Solving the Byzantine Generals problem is "not that high"?  
Dude, this is a bigger innovation than the Internet.  This is hah-YUGE.  It's going to change everything.  We will now have a perfect record of transactions (of all kinds, not strictly financial) with no need of a central authority to validate them.  This is a tectonic shift. Wait and see.

Same thing that triggered it in 2008 -- somebody will get called on a big derivative contract and won't be able to pay up (in 2008 this was Lehman Bros).  That will leave a bunch of other people involved with similar contracts called and unable to pay.  


It will be good for Bitcoin and some other valid coins.  The next time a crisis hits, ATM networks and credit card networks will be unable to function.  People will be unable to withdraw "their" money from banks.  Businesses will begin accepting crypto out of necessity because it will still work.  
Honestly, I'm not looking forward to it.  It's going to be extremely ugly for people who did what they were told (paid into their retirement accounts) and didn't buy Bitcoin to protect themselves (most people).
@_date: 2018-09-17 00:51:48

Next financial crisis will mean that your ATM and credit cards don't work, and the bank takes all your money in a "bail in."  Bitcoin will still work.

*We have a winnnaaa!! Give that poster a ceegaar!*
On some exchanges, the exchange will have to buy back the coins too. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:08:17
No way. There's a lot of money (including some of my own) waiting to buy 6K if we're lucky enough to get that discount again. No way it goes under that level much or for long. It might not even go sub-7K at this point.
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:20:47
Because all those dumps were borrowed, and the borrower needs to pay back all that BTC now.
@_date: 2018-09-16 02:07:57
Historically, the only people that have lost are people that sold.  It's real simple: a small community of neckbeards brought Bitcoin from 0 to $1000.  A slightly larger community brought it to $6K.  What do you think will happen when adoption reaches 5 percent?  What do you think will happen when the financial system collapses again and people can't get money out of their banks but Bitcoin still works?

@_date: 2018-09-19 17:39:03
I agree that slow adoption would be ideal, but when I look at the numbers, I see no way to avoid another crisis, likely much more severe than the one in 2008.
@_date: 2018-09-30 13:58:20
We have not. We have held a very respectable support level at 6000 for six months. For the past three months we've been slowly moving up from that level.  
It was only at 20K for five minutes.  Almost nobody bought at that level, and even those who did will end up in the green after hodling for a year or two.
@_date: 2018-09-30 00:56:17
If it's not worth anything, it's not money, much like your comment.
@_date: 2018-09-15 12:40:52
Not 100% but close enough.
Bitcoin will hit $1mil when the ATM networks go down and people are lined up down the block outside their banks to take out their $50 daily limit.  I don't think people grasp how big this crisis will be.  At this point it's just financially irresponsible to not own some Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:18:43
Higher than what?
@_date: 2018-09-27 13:58:29
Not if they don't know it exists.
Multisig wallets are also not vulnerable to such attacks.

So were Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and basically every other highly successful person in history not intelligent?  It's not logic that enslaves intelligent people; it's fear.
Intelligence gives people options.  If one great-paying career becomes a soul-killing dead end, intelligence allows a person to re-invent themselves and do something completely different.  Intelligence is actively suppressed by mindless entertainment, pointless work, and fear.
It's MUCH easier to control stupid people.  They're stupid, right? Easily fooled, tending to be very obedient because they're incapable of thinking for themselves or "seeing the whole playing field."  In fact, I would say that conformity and obedience are the greatest hallmarks of stupidity.  
From the time human beings first captured fire, it has always been the visionary, fearless, and creative that have led the way forward.  If not for them, we would still be shivering in caves. By definition, progress means breaking the mold and doing something different; only intelligent people are capable of doing that.

In the next crisis, Bitcoin will stop being a speculative asset and start being money. The banks are going to be having problems. Nobody -- NOBODY -- will want to sell Bitcoin on a centralized exchange to put dollars into a bank that has a line down the block of people who can't get their money out. Yeah, it's going to be that bad. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 00:51:11

DEBT is a problem in the US. The national debt is just one small part of it. Unlike Japan, a country that can safely run up a large national debt because of its citizens' high savings rate and lack of municipal debt, the U.S. cannot afford a large national debt.

Sell orders will definitely materialize as the price moves up. "Profit taking" is only natural for newbs.

Futures won't prevent that.  If anything, they'll accelerate it when it happens.  We should be thanking these writers of phony paper for artificially depressing the price and allowing more people to get on board before the next moon shot.
All Bitcoin needs to do is keep on keepin' on and a new moon will come, higher and brighter than the last.  It's simple supply and demand.  This is a rare commodity that can't be faked.  It is extremely useful, and more people realize this every day.  Further to that, it was invented in response to the 2008 financial meltdown and won't even begin to show its true utility to the masses until the next financial meltdown, which is just around the corner or perhaps starting now.

The dam will burst at 4400.  There's absolutely nothing for sale up there, and the margin calls will be catastrophic for the folks dumping the price with borrowed/non-existent Bitcoin.
The key level right now is 3900 though -- very active defense underway which tells me there's a *biiiig* contract that gets rekt at that level.

Now there is a lot more money in the game than there was then, and a lot of that money is on the dumb (short) side.  When those guys cover, we will overshoot the price of 12/17/2017 by a wide margin.  Patience. It will take a few more months.
@_date: 2019-03-21 13:58:18
That will definitely translate to at least 25K BTC being sold, but that won't all happen at once, and by then the Litecoin halvening plus our approaching halvening will have driven the price up so much from here that the effect will be minimal, maybe a few percentage point drop from a price much higher than today's.

I assume you're talking about the consumer, not the merchant.
First of all, chargebacks only exist because it is so easy to commit fraud with a bank card.  Your credit card info is for sale right now on the dark web.  That is not an issue with Bitcoin.
Second, hypothetically assume we lived in a world where Bitcoin ruled.  Businesses would be held to a higher standard because taking people's money and giving them a crap product would mean you would not be in business for long.  In any case, when you get a refund from the merchant, you usually have to go through a whole process anyway.  Refunds would be much easier to process in Bitcoin, just like taking cash out of the register and handing it back.

Your second point is semi-valid so I'll address it.  Looks like Dollar Tree ($DLTR) was the best one over the past ten years, with an 845% return over that time.  
Bitcoin's return over the past ten years is many, many times that.  We started at $.06.  It's, like, millions of percent higher now.

Gotta be a little more patient than that, but you won't lose.
What I do is place a big buy at a level that seems unlikely.  Right now it's at 3600, having been moved up from 3000.  And you do little fun-money market buys on the dips every so often.  At some point your big buy order gets hit, and it's usually very near a local bottom so you can sell half of it on the inevitable doubling a few months later.  We are due for a doubling.
I'm super-duper hoping it dumps and hits my order. So close.  Got so close last time and I'm a little bummed about it now.

It's a lot easier to confiscate gold than it is to confiscate Bitcoin.
Besides, there is no global government, and if one government decided to do that, they would quickly see an out-migration of a lot of rich, intelligent people. It would not be a good decision on that basis alone.  
In addition, Bitcoin is the future.  Governments that ban disruptive but productive technologies don't fare well.  See: North Korea and the Internet.

This is nothing.  It's a tiny little $50 dump.  I'm thinking about moving my order at $3700 up (again).  Seems like these guys will never wick it down that far again.
These dumpers are doing us all a huge favor.  They'll be the ones causing the first big green candles on the way up because they're borrowing all this BTC that they're dumping.  In the meantime, buy the dip and chill.  All is good.  
If you're buying Bitcoin because you want more dollars next month or next year, you're doing it wrong.  This is something we will be spending in a couple years.  It's protection against the dollar, not a way to get more dollars.

Yeah, every dump except the one from $4k is underwater, and that one will be underwater shortly.  
The best part about this particular sawtooth is that it happened without any pump whatsoever from the bullwhales.  It's a one-trick-pony bearwhale tantrum dump of very high volume almost instantly made unprofitable by small retail buyers.  When the bullwhales decide to pump again, the liquidations/margin calls on the short side will be enormous.

Have you ever wired a substantial sum of money internationally?  It will cost you $50K to send a million.  With Bitcoin, it costs like $1, $2 if you want to be sure to get in the next block.

You made a big logical leap from "everyone would try to Witdraw cash" to "Bitcoin would crash." 
Bitcoin IS cash. If you have it in that scenario, you're way ahead of the game unless you're an idiot storing your coins on an exchange. 
WHEN (not if) the banks go down, Bitcoin will show its true value, nevermind the price.
That being said, it's as stupid to not have physical cash as it is to not have Bitcoin right now. The value of cash money will go up when the Big Glorified Excel Sheet in the Sky known as modern banking goes down.
@_date: 2019-03-03 21:12:07
No.  It will not go down to fill those orders.  Those orders were placed by the same people who borrowed all that BTC (still not repaid) back in November to cause the big dump.  Those folks are sweating bullets now.  They can't hold that short forever, and they will be FORCED to cover at a loss.
TLDR: There's a lot more money on the buy side than on the sell side because certain people NEED to buy.

Huh? Have you ever spent Bitcoin?  I sent $100 to someone the other day.  The fee was $.07.  A credit card processor would have taken a MINIMUM of $2.50.  You don't see these fees directly as a consumer but merchants do.
Additionally, merchants have to do all the paperwork and wait 24-48 hours before the money goes into their accounts.  With Bitcoin, they get the money within ten minutes (usually).

What (s)he's saying is that all those illiquid debt-based "investments" are not really investments, just piles of debt.
Corporate debt has ballooned from about half a trillion to over $5 trillion in the past ten years.  Owning overpriced (due to buybacks done with borrowed money) stock in one of these over-leveraged zombies is stupid.  GE is bankrupt.  Deutsche Bank is bankrupt.  Many companies are bankrupt and playing a shell game.  
The only real investment in this scenario is in the money of the future while you can still trade it for the money of the past.  By the time people like you figure out the true value of Bitcoin, it will be too late.  I feel sorry for you, but it's not like you didn't have the chance to not be a dumbass.  That's what will make your regret so bitter: you'll have nobody to blame but yourself, poor no-coiner.

Yes, in the future QUALITY will become more important than quantity.  If someone is going to spend rare and precious Bitcoin, they will want to make sure they're getting a quality product in return.  Nobody will want to buy cheap crap from some slave-run factory on the other side of the world.
People hoping to earn Bitcoin will need to have the skills to produce quality products.  It would be great if we had more hand-crafted goods made with locally sourced materials, and Bitcoin might just help get us to that world.

Personally, I'm hoping a great number of newbs enter between now and June, and the big shorters continue giving their money away until then.  The more evenly we can distribute this wealth, the better.  Anyway, there's a new sherriff in town.
Realistically, everybody won't pile on at $10K.  A few lucky people will.  I think most of us here don't yet comprehend just how early we are.

Yeah, they're being unfairly attacked.  Almost like someone wants this easy onboarding to stop so that they can dump the price more easily.
That said, it looks to me very much like Coinbase is having BTC supply issues.  They drag their feet on BTC withdrawals (I should be able to take my BTC the minute they take my money, not two weeks later), and now they're actively encouraging people to trade away their BTC?

Dead wrong.  Prices rising on low volume is the most bullish sign there is.  It means sellers are out of coins and that any small bump in volume on the buy side (like, say, from people who are growing distrustful of stocks and bonds) will cause a massive spike up.

Nah man,  insane parabolic moves are the way.  They happen again, and again and again.  Like in 2017, we went from $1000 to $2000 almost overnight.  From $2000 to $5000 in a flash (and back to $3000), then from $3000 to $10000.  Everyone only notices the one that looks big now, but they all looked big at the time.
Same if you go back in Bitcoin history.  What you'll see is slight rises over time followed by a series of crazy spikes.  We're in the slight rise phase now.  The crazy spikes will come.  The hard part about hodling is NOT SELLING that first crazy spike because you will regret it.

Small depositors would have been made whole by the FDIC, and the people who caused the crisis would be poor right now.  It would have been the best course of action to have let the losers lose.  Instead, we made the problem worse by a) bailing them out and creating moral hazard and b) printing/borrowing money like no tomorrow, setting up the next crisis.

As someone who bought near an ATH and kept buying all the way down in 2014 and 2015, I can tell you for sure that those people did not make a bad investment.
Printing worthless paper to drive down the price of commodities is the oldest trick in the book.  They've been doing it to metals for years.  Look at the gold chart. It looks exactly like the Bitcoin chart -- CBOE introduces "cash-settled" (i.e., nobody ever touches actual gold) futures on gold and the price tanks and stays tanked.
This works with gold and soybeans and pork bellies because nobody wants to deal with the underlying asset.  Who wants to take delivery of a ton of gold or 50 tons of pork bellies?  The reason it won't work forever with Bitcoin is that everyone wants the underlying asset, and it is rare by design.  It can't be faked or counterfeited or exist on paper only.  At some point, the demand for the real thing will outstrip the phony supply in the paper market.  At some point after that, somebody will say, "You know, I think I'd rather have the Bitcoin than cash settle," and the loser on that contract will be on the hook for a TON of Bitcoin.  
Why do you think the settlement price on BTC futures contract goes down month after month after month?  It's a scam.  
The good news is that they are going to get rekt on a major scale because they messed with something they don't understand.

Pretty interesting.  A couple of points:
1) Bitcoin to the S&amp;P is not an apples-to-apples comparison.  There are -- as you know -- a lot of differences between the instruments and markets.  A better comparison might be to commodities where the price is heavily influenced by derivatives/futures and where it's a purely supply/demand play. Stocks move on all kinds of news and metrics related companies' performance.  You might be better off comparing with metals.
2) The Fed is *absolutely* propping up the stock market.  What are the implications?  Stocks could go "up" based on this free money, but is their *value* really going up?  What about the value of Bitcoin by comparison?  Is it likely to go up relative to fiat money that is being printed as though a bunch of sailors on three-day leave were in charge of the presses?
3) Liquidity.  Traditional TA is hit or miss with Bitcoin because the liquidity is so low.  One whale buying $200 million or shorting $200 million can cause a massive candle and blow any analysis out of the water.
3a) Take a look at the order books if you want to see where this is going.  It's about 7x as much money on the buy side as on the sell side.  I surmise that most of those buy orders in the $1000-2000 range have been placed by the guys that engineered the big dump back in November.  A LOT of Bitcoin was borrowed just prior to that dump (eg, 25,000 BTC from Genesis alone on November 12).  When will it be paid back?  That's when we bust out.
Trying to trade this is not smart in general.  Just buy dips and wait for for Shorty to pay his bills.
@_date: 2019-03-31 20:13:08
That would be an extremely dumb move.  Any fool can see that Bitcoin supply is tightening, and demand is not abating.  We're in for a long, slow climb past the ATH, then another big bubble next year.  People selling now will regret it for the rest of their lives.

I'm very curious: how could UI be improved?
Does Visa have any realtime apps with UI like this? 
And are you talking about UI in wallets? UI in exchange dashboards? UI in blockchain explorers?  Bitcoin is a protocol.  It doesn't have a "UI" any more than http/https or tcp/ip or or ftp/sftp or udp or any other protocol has.  
I keep hearing these complaints about "UI," yet sending Bitcoin is far easier than using a credit card.  Just hit send, scan the QR code, done. No handing it to the merchant and having them swipe it through the machine, wait for a printout, bringing it to you to sign, waiting 48 hours to get their money... blah blah blah.  **Bitcoin is extremely easy to use, far easier than a credit card**.  Easier than cash (considering most people can't do basic arithmetic to make change these days)
You people sound like the old farts afraid of these newfangled computers and clinging to your fax machines in 1992.  Eerily similar.  I feel sorry for you.

"Cash back" lol -- hold for a couple years.  You get LOTS of "cash back" on every purchase.  Also, that "cash back" you get from your credit card comes out of the pockets of merchants in the form of fees and is built into the price.
I feel so sorry for no-coiners, especially the ones who are here who have had every opportunity to educate themselves.  The regret will be extreme, and it will set in a few months from now and last a lifetime.

In the future, when you buy real estate, the deed will be in the form of a cryptographic token.  The deal will be extremely simple: exchange the deed for the agreed-upon amount of Bitcoin.  
For people who don't have enough Bitcoin to buy outright, there will be other tokens of potentially unlimited supply that will be useful for lending.  They will borrow those tokens, exchange for Bitcoin, and do the deal described above.
Pretty sure all real estate deals will settle in Bitcoin within ten years.

With what's happening in traditional markets, especially bond markets, you'd have to be completely stupid to not be buying -- or, worse, selling -- Bitcoin right now.
EDIT -- let me explain further:
[Yield curves]( are officially inverted.  The **1 month** *Treasury pays a higher rate of interest than the 10-year Treasury*.  What this means is that the longer-term bonds are essentially worthless, or worth pennies on their nominal dollar value.  That's just the tip of the iceberg.  The corporate paper market is even more distorted.
Who holds long-term Treasuries?  Banks.  
What happens when you use your credit card or go to the ATM:  The bank makes an entry on its ledger.  To keep these ledgers solvent (or to give them the appearance of solvency), banks basically float massive checks to each other in the form of [interbank loans](  What is likely to happen in that market when trust erodes due to everyone knowing that everyone else's balance sheet is like a gigantic sheet of toilet paper?  Calls will be made.  
I'm telling you, the day will come when you will try to use your card, and it won't work because your bank won't have the money to cover the ledger entry or give you cash.  That day is coming.  It may come next week or it may come three months from now, but -- make no mistake -- it's coming.  When that day comes, you'll be very glad you bought Bitcoin.

It's more about physical delivery. Nobody wants to deal with a large amount of physical gold so fake "cash-settled" "gold" contracts are very effective in suppressing the price.  Bitcoin is a totally different animal.

If you love or like someone, you should gently encourage them to hold a little Bitcoin as part of their portfolio.  If you don't like them, just shut up. Oh, and if you know someone who has bought but is keeping their coins on an exchange, help them to set up a cold wallet of their own.
It won't do you any good to be a bloviating preacher about it, though.
@_date: 2019-03-08 19:08:36
Yes, BitMex is the main culprit.  They have been around for a while but only introduced high leverage in December 2017.  
Don't discount CBOE though.  That is an influential market, and if you look at the settlement prices, the further out in the future you go, the lower the price gets.  There will be some very big losers in Chicago in the coming months.
@_date: 2019-11-10 21:48:57
The price has been artificially dumped for almost two years.
The rich can get richer with Bitcoin, but most of them won't, especially the ones who have been artificially dumping the price with their silly paper contracts.  They will get poorer -- much poorer -- and that's a good thing.

Try sending $500,000 to someone either standing in front of you or on the other side of the world more cheaply, quickly, or securely than you can send them that much BTC.  That's just one of *many* "use cases."  
Even more "use cases" will become apparent in the coming months as the traditional banking system eats its just desserts, to the detriment of all no-coiners, unfortunately.

Just buy whatever you're comfortable "losing" in the short term.  If it goes down, buy a little more.  It looks like it's about to go up in a big way in my opinion.  Bulls seem to be toying with bears, setting a floor at $4K and forcing bears to sell there, cheap, before they pump it again.
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:31:57
It might be $3900 he's defending. Anyway -- rekt.  By Friday sub-$4K Bitcoin will be a thing of the past forever, and by August Litecoin will have hoisted us to a new ATH.  
By the way, the latest Bisq update is sweet. If you want some Liteocin -- which I recommend -- you can trade for Bitcoin there and it's super duper drop-dead stupid simple to use.
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:23:39
I don't believe in benchmarking trends from wicks, and if you look at weekly candles, that spike in 12/17 was just a wick.  The trend is actually better drawn from a few weeks before that, from around $6k.  But if you go back just a month before that, now you're drawing your line from $3k, and where does that put your "long term trend?"
You know what's funny? I made a good chunk of change on LONG trades last year, just playing around with a tiny bit of accumulated BTC.
This year I'm exchanging fiat for BTC again.  Just moved my big order up from $3600 to $3700 (had moved it up previously from $3000) so I'm hoping against hope that the big bears find some more borrowed BTC to dump at a loss.  
Your posts are going to age horribly, and you will regret not having bought this ill-considered dip, probably for the rest of your life. I was on BitcoinTalk back in 2014-2015, and there were a lot of people there just like you.  They were wrong then, and you're wrong now.
[EDIT to say...] Those people on BTCTalk were more obnoxious than you, now that I think about it.  Back then it was all, "Bitcoin is dead! You guys are idiots for buying!"  Nobody thinks Bitcoin will die now.

It's not an East-West thing. Plenty of people in Asia are buying. Why do you think those dumps got "stuffed?" 
The effect of all this will be massive though. It's basically a massive transfer of wealth from the banksters trying to kill Bitcoin to those of us all over the world who continue using it and thwarting their feeble one-trick-pony attempt.

The halving is going to be a big deal.  The Litecoin market is big enough that reducing the number of new coins by half will squeeze the price up a lot, no matter what happens before then.  It will probably go up a bit between now and August, but I don't think the halving will be fully priced in due to the manipulation of the market by the big bears, who will be screwed hard by the time it all shakes out.
@_date: 2019-03-27 01:48:39
How are you losing money in this market? We're up 25% in the past 100 days.  If this were a stock you'd be over the moon.

It's been over a month since we've had a good pump.  I think we might see one on Friday or Saturday.  All that borrowed/dumped BTC has to be repaid at some point.  End of month seems logical, plus it's payday in East Asia and Western Europe.
It's got to be getting frustrating for the dumpers to see their dumps go into the red within hours.  With any luck, they're not smart enough to cut their losses just yet.  Would like to see the price stay under $5K for at least a couple more months.

They could very well be time locked.  I personally think that "Satoshi" was an elite far-above-top-secret and multinational group of hackers within the NSA and possibly British, Japanese, Russian and Israeli intelligence who saw what an enormous threat the banksters posed to national and global security in 2008.  I suspect that the keys to that wallet are held by high-level people (well above the POTUS or the queen/emperor or Netanyahu or Putin) who must all agree before the coins are moved.
Either that or Hal Finney was Satoshi, and he died without passing that key on.
But the fact that Satoshi's identity has never been revealed shows me that he was a 1337 government-level haxzor, not a hobbyist.

Let's say I lend you a cow at interest.  You agree to pay me back two cows in five years.
In order for that system to work, another cow has to be created.  That's pretty much how it works.  In order for loans to be repaid at interest, more loans have to be made (this is how money is created, contrary to popular belief), the money supply has to increase.  This is why fiat is guaranteed to lose value over time -- the supply is ever-increasing, and it's not like cows where there are constraints on how many calves a cow can have.

That's a pretty good return.  Better than the stuck market even at all-time highs.

Traders are losers for the most part.  Hodlers outperform them by orders of magnitude.
I trade a bit, but that's only because I've hedled for so long that I have nothing to lose (and, unlike most traders, seldom do lose which is funny because they banned me from BitcoinMarkets which is apparently now the exclusive domain of paid Madison Ave beartroll morons).
Word to the wise for any lurking traders:  shorting is great as a hedge if you understand math. As a way to make money it's very foolish, especially now.  When this busts its nut, it's gonna spray out the shorties' ears like a Bronx fire hydrant in July.
@_date: 2019-11-03 22:34:43
It depends on how specific.  If I were to tell you the price of Bitcoin tomorrow, I would probably be wrong.  If I were to say, "Bitcoin will be at least 5x as valuable in dollar terms as it is today one year from now" I would be likelier to be more correct.  If I were to say, "Bitcoin be priced higher one year from now than it is today" I would almost certainly be correct.
We can definitely paint a pretty accurate picture of the future by using broader strokes.  In some cases, such as astronomical events, we can be almost 100% accurate.

No, banks in their current form are the problem.  If all they did was guard deposits and make prudent loans, it would be copacetic.  But they're gambling with your money, and when the wheel doesn't land on black, they won't be the ones to lose.  Ask anyone in Greece or Cyprus or Argentina.
When that happens, we have to remember to be kind to the no-coiners even though they've been such a bunch of pesky, ignorant jerks all these years.  They're going to have it rough.

Indeed.  The past 14 months have been a blessing in disguise, allowing many people to get on board and other people to accumulate more.  I have no doubt that the goal was to kill Bitcoin, but it didn't work out that way.

Another work week about to begin in East Asia.  European and Asian paydays at the end of the week, possibly borrowed Bitcoin due to be repaid (end of month).  Friday could be a big day.  Seems like the dumpers can't even dump on a Sunday with ultra-low volume.  
But none of that matters in the great scheme of things.  Everybody who knows anything knows that *Bitcoin will win*.  It's just a question of when and how.  If most of us are kind, generous, wise people who will use our power for good, not evil, only then will we know if Bitcoin really fulfilled its mission.

Coinbase will do itself in eventually, as will all the other centralized exchanges, by selling more BTC than it actually has custody over.  It happened to Gox (bullshit they got hacked.  Their Willybot dug a big hole from which they couldn't emerge). I strongly suspect it happened to QuadrigaX.  
Something is definitely funky with Coinbase's supply these days.  It's taking way too long to get to the point where you can actually move your coins off exchange after trading your dollars.  
That being said, Coinbase actually did challenge the IRS in court to protect its users' information.  I'm not sure that they are as evil as everyone says.  Don't keep your coins there though, and try Bisq.  
Edit -- it could also be that this whole  thing is some kind of PR bullcrap scam. Maybe the mad dumpers are finding it hard to drive the price down due to all the buying on the convenient spot market Coinbase provides. If that's the case, everybody should just keep buying at Coinbase and let the KYC chips fall where they may.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:22:10
Yeah, that happened to a lot of people.
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:10:34
Why so impatient?  We're still in the "wear them down and take as much of their money as you can" phase of this young bull market.  When Bitcoin goes on a run, you'll know it.  It could be six months from now or it could be tomorrow (I do expect a BGD tomorrow due to CME closing and subsequent covering, but that won't constitute a bull run).  
Like I said, you'll know it when you see it, but we bulls are in no rush.  Time is on our side.  Just look at the funding rates for shorts if you don't believe me.
@_date: 2019-03-22 00:32:16

You made a life-changing decision today.  Advice: Don't sell if it doubles and doubles again.  Commit to hodling for at least 24 months, preferably 36.  I now look at it as a 36-month CD that pays thousands of percent.  Many is the Bitcoiner who regretted taking a 300% profit.  You think to yourself, "I'll buy back when it drops.  Surely it will drop after a rally like that," then watch it double again in a month.  It's a much worse feeling than watching the price going down and being happy to be able to buy more for your fiat.

It is interesting how you're projecting, you must admit.  That whole "1,975 days" thing is just creepy and betrays your compulsive obsession with not imbibing of that thing that once gave you so much pleasure that it nearly killed you (or so they tell you).
I mean, it's kind of typical for a "recovered alcoholic" to accuse normal people who drink once in a while of what they wish they could do again (be their true selves) when they detect truth, even if emitted from a sober mind, is it not?
My advice to you would be to discard your obsession with alcohol (and stop accusing sober people of being drunk, mistaking truth for intoxication) and simply buy Bitcoin and free yourself.  The truth is very intoxicating, as is freedom.

I love how you guys draw all your lines from that point.  Nobody actually bought that high.  If they had, the price would have stayed there.
By the way, the current price is the same as it was two months before that run-up.  Over a year of heavy shorting and FUD, and they brought it back two months from the ATH.  Think about that.  What do you think will happen when shorts repay all the BTC they borrowed in November, you know, the BTC they dumped to drop the price?
@_date: 2019-03-02 21:03:44
That sounds totally pointless.  Just take fiat if that's what you want.

I thought like you for a few too many years, then I saw that Bitcoin had become a significant portion of my net worth even though it had been a very small investment.  Last year, I said "Fuck it," sold almost all my stocks and went all in at -- as it turned out -- exactly the right time.  Best thing I've ever done for my financial security.

Or taking his wealth to a more civilized country.  Or using a Tor-enabled peer-to-peer exchange like Bisq.  Or just never selling and waiting for the current system to collapse under the tremendous weight of its own corruption and stupidity, then spending it peer-to-peer.
Why does nobody ever question the notion that the government should have the right to look up your financial ass?  It's bullshit.  The government should have ZERO right to look at your financial affairs per the Fourth Amendment.  The Fed needs to go.  The government can mint money.  It doesn't need to borrow it.  Half my taxes go to paying interest to the owners of the Fed.  Fuck that.

You realize almost nobody bought at the ATH, right?  The price was at 19K for less than five minutes. Very dumb place from which to draw your trend line.
On December 15 2018, the price was $3100.  I'm drawing all my lines from there since obviously that's the point where everyone bought.

If I give a friend $100 worth of Bitcoin as a gift, no KYC is involved because I obviously know my friend.  
Bisq is peer-to-peer.  There is no customer, therefore no "know your customer." 
 
No laws are being broken if one person sells a legal item to another person.  The problem here is the banks who can close your account and take your money for no reason other than "suspicion" that you are engaging in perfectly legal peer-to-peer activity.

Unlike Venmo, PayPal, etc, you don't have to sign up or register for anything to use Bitcoin, let alone "jump hurdles."  It's kind of the whole point.

That sounds about right to me.  A break up is not far off though.  Big bears seem to be in a "don't fire 'til you see the whites of their eyes" stance right now, running out of coins to dump at a loss.  Bulls can push it up any time they want, but the longer we sit here, the richer buyers get and the more people have a chance to get in before it blasts off. I think June will be a big month.

It's true, there will be some new super-rich, but I can't see Tim Draper starting a war for giggles.  I think there are going to be some very cool projects funded anonymously and not for profit like the [Pineapple Fund](  This will be a whole new species of rich people who got rich because they were idealists and visionaries, not because they were born with the name "Rockefeller" and own shares in the Federal Reserve.
Speaking of war, do you know why wars happen?  Do you know who makes money off war?  When fiat money defeats itself and Bitcoin takes over, war will make rich people poorer, not richer.  It will dis-incentivize war in a big way.

1) It's easier to use.  Scan and tap
2) No middleman to pimp out your data (banks sell your private financial data)
3) Merchant gets paid instantly and doesn't have to wait 24-48 for the money to hit their account
4) Much less paperwork and hassle for merchant (no need to close out the credit card ticker every day, file the receipts, etc.
5) No expensive equipment to rent/buy on the merchant's part
6) Customer gets a de facto discount because they're probably spending BTC they've held for a while
7) Merchant gets sound money instead of Monopoly bank money
I'm sure there are others.

You pay tax on the difference in price (capital gain) between the time you bought it and the time you sold it.


You sent your BTC from Coinbase to the wallet -&gt; the wallet is connected to you.

I don't understand why people suck up to governments and banks when all they bring is tyranny, servitude, and war.
But I do agree with you that we Bitcoiners win even if the financial collapse doesn't happen... but it's going to happen.  Everyone should have at least a little Bitcoin, and maybe the collapse won't be such a big deal for us, just for the banksters who will be responsible for it -- which seems fair, doesn't it?

$200K is life changing money to most people who are struggling to make ends meet on a $100K salary.  If you put the same amount of money in stocks in an IRA at that time, you'd have like $2000 that you wouldn't be able to touch until you're 59.  Even with Bitcoin being very affordable right now, you've got over $20,000 which is a much better cushion than $2000 in some bullshit account that isn't even really yours.

Close but no cigar. 
In the late 1990s, thanks to the advent of cell phones, the NSA got a good look at what the CIA was really doing, just how evil they actually are. When the coup of 2000 led to 9/11, the NSA sprung into action to destroy the CIA.
Problem was, NSA is comprised of geeks, not cold blooded killers and criminals. All those leaks (Abu Graib, Chelsea Manning, WikiLeaks, Panama Papers) were not an accident. 
2008, the CIA banksters steal billions, crash the economy, cause millions to lose their homes... the invention of Bitcoin shortly thereafter was not a coincidence. [see genesis block] Do you think Satoshi's identity would or could have remained secret if he weren't a 1337, government-level hacker? 
Bitcoin probably was created by the NSA, but the NSA might just be the good guys.

LTC will be silver to BTC's gold.  It will be ideal for transmitting modest sums of value and easily (instantly) exchangeable for gold. BTC will still rule when it comes to big money.

It's funny because it was a December in 2012 that first piqued my interest in Bitcoin.  I was reading an article in the Financial Times (or maybe the Wall Street Journal) on the subject of systemic bank failures in Cyprus and how a lot of people were buying Bitcoin there.  Wish I had bought Bitcoin at that time because Cyprus and Greece brought Bitcoin to a whopping $1000 in no time flat shortly thereafter.

For spending maybe, but even that's debatable.  It's much easier to use Bitcoin if the merchant takes it, and once you have Bitcoin you actively do business with people who take it.  I haven't bought a plane ticket with fiat in probably four years.  Believe it or not, there are plenty of places to spend Bitcoin, and it's far easier to use than a credit card and far less intrusive.
For transferring larger sums or saving?  No.  In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say it's flat-out stupid to keep savings in fiat.  Buy the dip and come back in 36 months.  It's even dumber to wire money using a bank.  Why would you pay a bank 3-5% of the amount you're sending, wait several days, file mounds of paperwork etc when you could just zap the BTC at a cost of .1% (or less) and have it get there in ten minutes?

Right. Because everyone knows that your public key is you.
The anonymous transaction data is public which is great.  The personal information hacked from Experian was meant to be private (so they could sell it to anybody who would pay, even though you never gave them permission to do that) but got hacked.  
I don't expect you to understand, and I basically feel sorry for you.

The whole point of Bitcoin is that it doesn't need to be tied up with third parties -- ever.  So wrong.
Also, "can't exchange Bitcoin for real money?" Seriously? Has this idiot ever used Bitcoin? It is real money. You can buy stuff with it. Today. If exchanges are not doing their books correctly, at least cite an example. I don't know of any since Gox.
There were a lot of other things (like the "slowness" of mining.  Does this knuckle dragger even know what POW is? If it were easy and quick to mine, BTC would have no value) but those two jumped out at me.

Fraud happens with fiat too and on a much larger scale.  Wells Fargo ring a bell?
Please cite some examples (like I just did) if you're going to make claims like that.  Bitcoin actually makes fraud a hell of a lot harder to pull off, but I don't think you understand the technology well enough to see that.  I also think you have an agenda, and I know that you will be quite regretful of your unwise decision to not invest now while prices are low.

Dash -- interesting take on centralization.  Big players have incentive to hodl.  Very fast, very private.  Been around for six years, I believe.  Fairly widely accepted in some parts of the world.
Litecoin -- almost as secure and decentralized as Bitcoin but much faster. Active development and user communities.  Now good for small transactions, will be useful for medium-large transactions in the nearish future, transactions where you want it on-chain, like buying a car.
Large transactions will settle in Bitcoin.  For other purposes, other tokens will be better suited and will be needed because Bitcoin will be so rare.

It's not all shit, but 90 percent of it is, especially when applying traditional TA to this market.  This is a completely different market based almost solely on supply and demand.  In traditional markets, people look at news, rumors, announcements and balance sheets along with TA.  In this market, one whale deciding to drop a measly $20 million on BTC (or a bear dumping $100 million) can cause a sizeable spike upward (or downward) that will invalidate whatever your TA is saying.  Or an exchange could get nervous about its supply and start buying.  Or some weird derivative could expire.  Or a short needs to pay back the BTC they borrowed.  Etc.
My favorite formation is the one I named -- the First Rule of Holes.  This is when a big, dumb, obviously borrowed dump slowly becomes unprofitable based on low retail volume.  It shows that demand is high and tempts bears to dump again even though they're swimming upstream against the market -- which we want them to do so that more people can get more cheap coins before the wheels come off in the traditional financial system.

That sub has a lot of good information, actually. I don't think being called a "conspiracy theorist" is really an insult these days. It just mean you question the official narrative that is being pumped at you through every mainstream media outlet. That itself indicates a conspiracy, doesn't it? Every outlet reports the story with the exact same spin? Nobody actually looks at the "study" (which was probably funded by a PR outfit) and points out the glaring problems with it.
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:21:21
I'm with you. I hope it stays in this range or goes a little lower for a while longer so that people can load up before the next moon shot.
The OP is probably right though.  It won't take much of a demand increase to pump it up fast right now.  There are 31,000 coins owed (shorted) on Bitfinex alone.  Shake out 1/3 of those, and the price will explode fast.

Comparing all the data on the entire Web after 20 years of growth to one single-use blockchain that hasn't even been around for 10 years is fallacious.  You could just as quickly and easily read from and parse any given blockchain as read from and parse the entire Internet. Writing to an old-fashioned database is obviously easier/faster because you're not cryptographically verifying every piece of data inserted, but that's a feature, not a bug, of blockchains.

Not even that because all the competing exchanges do the same KYC/AML stuff everybody is "up in arms" about.
I would bet that the folks trying to dump the price are finding it harder than they expected in large part due to folks buying on Coinbase.  If they could get all those pesky buyers off that exchange, they could really tank the price.
I hope Coinbase's business goes UP because of this obviously engineered campaign. 
All that being said, get your coins of Coinbase and all exchanges.  Extreme fuckery is underway.  They're selling more BTC than they have.  QuadrigaX, once the biggest exchange in Canada, is the canary in the coal mine here.

How is money loaned out in the new world? Very rarely by people who have actual money (ie, not entitled banksters pulling it out of their butts) to people who can show a legitimate need and the ability to pay it back.

Pretty sure Litecoin will be over a thou next year. They have their halving in February.  Good coin.

I hope you're right.  If the crash is delayed long enough for Bitcoin/crypto to gently replace the traditional financial system, that would be ideal.  Just let them fade gently into history.

I agree, but if BTC were worth $1 million, I wouldn't be comfortable keeping my entire stack on a Ledger in my sock drawer (not that I do that now). If Goldman is buying many millions of dollars worth of BTC or managing a lot of BTC at Poloniex, they're going to make sure it's secure and outsource that job to someone who specializes in it.

Bisq is good.
Wasabi is a good way to anonymize coins if you are so inclined.
If you do have to buy dollars with your Bitcoin and are able to buy more dollars than the dollars you sold to get the Bitcoin, you should just pay the tax on your profit.  The last thing anyone wants is trouble with the goons at the IRS.

Bitcoin clears in seconds too then.  It's just not confirmed until a few minutes (as opposed to a few days for credit card transactions).

Jack is the smartest guy in corporate bullshit social media by far.  Always has been.
Lightning nodes are brilliant in the sense that the only party taking a risk is the one running the channel.  There is a miniscule risk.  They are also the only ones receiving a reward (aside from miners, of course, who would take their share no matter what).  People opening LN channels now are like the geeks and stoners that bought/used BTC in 2011 -- extremely rich in the future.  
Prediction: Within 5 years, running a BTCPay Server and Lightning Node will be like having your own little Visa network.  It will pretty much be free money, and the early adopters will be the biggest beneficiaries, as usual.

BTFD and STFU.  This is Bitcoin.  The smart hodl.
@_date: 2019-08-29 21:01:09
Yes, there are big players who try to keep a lid on the price.  They can do it for a few months at a time by selling large amounts of Bitcoin that they borrow very expensively from Genesis and other lenders.  Last year they did it at $6K.  This year they're doing it at $10K.  Next year they'll be doing it at $100K.  
They write lots of counterfeit Bitcoin in the form of futures contracts which is how they try to mitigate their losses.  At some point they get killed on both the futures and the spot shorts, and the price rises.  
IMO, now is an excellent time to buy.  It might drop more, but just hodl.  They always have to pay back those big shorts.
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:07:15
Ruh roh.  Somebody lent out too many Bitcoins to the shorters.  Spike incoming.

@_date: 2019-08-29 11:16:08
I wouldn't say that at all.  It all depends on how much money these dummies want to give away.
Anyway, the smallness of the red candles relative to the amount of money given away is quite bullish.  Last year they gave away billions at $6k.  This year they're doing it at $10K.  BTFD and hodl as always.
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:59:04

That's what Litecoin is for.  New blocks every 2.5 minutes.  Just as decentralized as Bitcoin but not as secure.
You don't want on-chain BItcoin transactions to be too fast or too cheap.  On-chain BTC transactions are for maximum security and sending substantial amounts of money.  It's digital gold.  Gold is heavy and slow.

Very simple: "price volatility" allows smart people to buy dips and hodl which has proved to be much better than keeping money in the bank.  As more people realize this, more people will become hodlers.  As more people hodl and see gains, more people will spend and sell to new people as has happened for the past 10 years.
We're still very early in this game.  When adoption reaches, say, 10%, prices will be much higher and it will be obvious to everyone that bank money is dumb money.

When the financial system collapses, Bitcoin will be there to cushion the fall.

People won't even realize how profound and important this invention is until after it changes the world for the better.

So they say in their history books.  A stroll around any old graveyard says otherwise.  People routinely lived into their 70s, 80s, and 90s hundreds of years ago.

There is no pump and dump in Bitcoin.  It's dump and pump.  The people trying to keep the price of Bitcoin down borrow a bunch of Bitcoin, dump it, hope that the price will keep falling but Bitcoiners buy the dip.  It's very expensive to borrow Bitcoin so the dumpers don't want to hold those underwater shorts too long.  They cover their shorts and we get the observed pumps.
This is why we BTFD -- because we know that whoever dumped it will have to buy back in whether they borrowed the coins they dumped or whether they owned them.  There is a fixed and known supply of Bitcoin.  If you want to stay in the game, you're going to have to buy that dump back, and your $1000 dump will turn into a $3000 pump when you do because hodlers don't sell.

In effect, individual banks do create money when they make loans.
You go to your banker and borrow $500,000 for a mortgage.  Does he go to his vault and get the money?  No, he has about 7% of that to back your loan.  For the rest, he calls up the Fed and has it printed.
Yes, the Fed explicitly pulls the money out of its ass, but in effect, your bank -- in catalyzing that action -- is creating it when they make the loan.  In fact, all fiat money is just an IOU.  Stop picking nits.

The fact that most people won't touch Bitcoin is an argument in favor of another 2017-sized rally.  It's still early.  When we get to the point of most people touching Bitcoin, the price will stabilize.  That's probably 5-10 years out.
If a small group of nerds and druggies can make it worth $100, then a small group of innovation-minded financiers can bring it to $1000, then a small group of normal people join the fun and bring it to $5000, imagine what will happen when the sizes of those groups get larger (which it will).
I know a lot of nerds and druggies who won't touch Bitcoin.  You're underestimating scarcity and not thinking correctly about demand.  The price goes up because demand grows.  Nobody ever stops buying Bitcoin, especially after they've been in the game for a few years.
People like you scared me a little when I first got into it back in 2014.  Now you're just funny, all that stuff about "MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL DISTRESS" is pretty pathetic.  You're not a very good writer, and nobody was distressed.  Get over yourself.  Stack some sats and go live your life for a couple years.

Yeah, just think back to winter when we were ranging betwen 3.5 and 4K for three months.  Or late spring when we were bouncing around 8K.  Same thing only now it's 10K.

You're an idiot parroting brainwashing points that were drilled into you in school with no logical or rational backup whatsoever.  "The economy" as it stands today is a system of slavery that destroys the planet.  It turns 99% of people into tax slaves and consumption drones being sucked of their energy from cradle 'til grave while allowing the 1% to live in the lap of luxury, never wanting for anything.
You'd better be careful calling people "idiots" when all you're doing is regurgitating bullshit that you read in a textbook instead of thinking for yourself.

Go back under the bridge, troll.  This is your last chance to buy under $10K.

OK folks, here's the deal:
We need to get this above 8400 and keep it there for a few hours. If we do not do that, it will dump again in a big way. If we do, it will pump like mad. That's just how it is.
If we lose this battle and it does dump, buy as much as you can on the dip because we will win the war. Just ask peole who bought the last time this happened, last year when we struggled to get it over 6500 and the guy won on his big put and dumped to 3.2K. This would be like that. Be the one who buys at 3.2K.
If we dump, it will only be to 7K. That's the best discount Shorty can offer this time around. But let's not do that. Let's get it over 8.4 and nail this chump to the wall once and for all!

I've been right for years now.  You should know. You were one of the guys mocking me when I was telling everyone to buy $6K and $3K.  You were probably one of the guys on bitcointalk making fun of me when I was buying $400 just a few short years ago.

At this point I have no sympathy for anyone who has not hedged their portfolio with Bitcoin. They have had every opportunity. The writing has been on the wall about the coming financial collapse for at least a year, and Bitcoins's price has been kept artificially low for 20 months. Don't come crying to me nocoiners. Your poverty is your own damn fault. Bitcoin offered you an escape hatch, and you insisted on being a stupid jerk.
As for the already poor who have no assets, it won't make anything but a positive difference for them as they will be able to earn and save hard money and perhaps get a leg up in the new world.

The left can't meme, and neither can the Bitcoin manipulators.
For a meme to work, it must convey truth.
The truth is, for all but 5 months of its existence, Bitcoin was at a lower price than it is now.  What that means in layman's terms is that most hodlers are way up.  
This is a fantastic time to buy, folks.  Don't keep any more money in a bank than you can afford to lose.

Do you think you're making original arguments?  We've heard all this shit for years.  
It's not a gamble.  The price going up over time has nothing to do with the system failing.  The system will fail, and that will cause Bitcoin to become much more valuable, but that's not the reason the price goes up.  
The price goes up because more and more people all over the world join the party every single day.

Even if these idiots dump it all the way down to $9K again, it won't stay there, and they will have given a lot of money away, just like they did last year when they were selling billions of dollars worth for under $6K.
Fuck outta here with that bullshit.

You should be withdrawing to your own wallet.  If you keep it on an exchange, they will lend it to short sellers, and if the exchange has issues, you'll lose your BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-27 22:06:40
That's not how the Bitcoin market works.  That's how traditional markets work.
Around here, we have been buying the dip for years and years.  We know Bitcoin will always recover which can't be said for stocks. 
This is why each bear market bottoms out at 3x the previous "ATH" in the three-year cycle.  $3K was the bottom, 3x higher than the $1K ATH in the previous cycle.  Next time we have a bear market, the bottom will be approximately $60K.
If you've been through a couple cycles like this, it's very easy to buy the dip.  Nobody ever panics which is why every bearwhale is slaughtered like a diseased pig, thrown in a bottomless pit, and incinerated.

If Venezuela is able to return to prosperity despite crippling U.S. sanctions, I think that would be a strong indication that Bitcoin is good for the economy and good for the world.

What part of "2008" don't you understand?  It was very close to a total economic collapse.  That poor guy was out of work for over a year.  He lost everything.  He didn't dip into his 401k until he had to, I would guess 9 or so months into his unemployment.  Like most people, I suppose he bought the lie that he would be gainfully employed and not need the money until he was in his Golden Years.  Unfortunately, he didn't make it to his Golden Years.  He took his own life and fuck you very much for being a judgmental prick.
Do you have 9 months of emergency savings in your little 1%-paying bankster scam savings account?
Bottom line: 401k withdrawal penalties are telling you that your money is not yours.  It's economic slavery.
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:56:54
No, we need to kill the banks in their current form.  It is modern slavery.
Debt is not good unless it is a short-term debt with a low rate of interest that leads to immediate and sustainable economic activity.  Large banks are cancer on this planet.  If we are to have banks, they should be small community banks, not the grotesque, wealth-stealing, planet-destroying entities of today.

They'll just keep bailing everything out until it becomes fruitless.  Then they'll bail everything in, and everyone (except Bitcoiners and gold bugs) will lose almost everything.

I use GBTC for funds trapped in my IRAs.  Unfortunately, I will be penalized if I withdraw those funds before I'm some arbitrary bullshit age because The Man says I shouldn't have control over my own damn money

I'll buy GBTC because the premium is lower than your idiotic tax pentalty and the upside is exponentially higher than buying a stake in your zombie companies.  It's worth the markup on those grounds, I guess.

Not even close.  The current price is artificially low thanks to people who dump mass amounts of Bitcoin because they can print all the fiat they want.  The halving will start to be baked in sometime in December or January when miners begin to sit on coins instead of selling them.

False.  Housing prices go up because ever more money is printed in the form of debt to pay for them.  It's the same reason university tuition goes up.

That's a lie.  In fact, people were a lot healthier back when everyone smoked.  I never knew a kid who had asthma, and we were all exposed to secondhand smoke constantly, even in school.
The reason "they" don't want you to smoke is because smoking activates neurotransmitters that reduce fear and susceptibility to fear-based programming.  If "they" made things illegal because they're bad for you, half the things on your supermarket's shelves would be Schedule 4 drugs.

Do people think life will just go on as normal during the next recession?  In 2008, we were hours away from ATM and credit card networks ceasing to function.  This time, it won't be possible to bail them out even if it were politically palatable (which it will not be -- people will be pissed at bankers and not in the mood to bail them out).
The value of Bitcoin will explode in the opening months of the next recession, and it's likely to go up a lot in the days before the next recession as smart money seeks a refuge outside the dying system.

@_date: 2019-08-21 12:25:50
As bad as it is, wealth distribution in Bitcoin is not nearly as bad as in traditional instruments.  
Because it is deflationary, Bitcoin distribution will even out over time.  As people at various stages hit their "moon," they will sell or spend some of their BTC.  As the new supply shrinks, price will rise over time (talking years and decades here) and people five years from now who get paid and hodl what we now consider small amounts of BTC will be proportionally richer.
These little dumps we're seeing at this stage in the game are an example of Bitcoin evening out wealth distribution.  Sellers are redistributing wealth to buyers just like they did last year when they were engineering these dumps at $6000.  Next year they'll be doing it at $20K or $50K, maybe higher.
TLDR -- When people take gains (or short using their copious supply of fiat to tamp the price down temporarily) along the way, wealth gets redistributed

They crawl up my ass every damn day.  Yours too.  It's bullshit.
Merchants who accept Bitcoin payments can simply record cash sales for accounting purposes, pay their taxes on that.  In a few years when they start spending their Bitcoin, the IRS can get fucked because there won't be any personally identifying information attached to those coins.
If the government wants to continue collecting revenue (and I hope it does -- not to pay back the Rothschilds and Rockefellers for the fake money they lend us via the Fed but for real services that benefit the people) it will have to eliminate the IRS within a few years because that agency is totally inefficient and despised by 90 percent of Americans.  It should be pretty easy.  We'll have plenty of money to influence the political process.  No more borrowing fake money.  Real money issued by the Treasury.  VAT or national sales tax.  No more Fourth and Fifth Amendment-violating tax returns, no more IRS.  That's coming within the next decade.

I keep reading all over the Internet comments like yours, intimating or stating outright that these workers do not deserve a pension anyway, should have saved for retirement, are lazy welfare creeps for expecting the company to uphold its end of the deal.  It's absolutely disgusting to me.  
Pensions used to work back in the old days because we had a regulated financial system wherein fiduciaries were strictly constrained in what they could do with other people's money.  Pensions began to fail in the past 20 years because of the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act which has led directly to the free-for-all we have today in the banking and financial system.
It has become clear that these bankers are going to steal everything from everyone.  Bitcoin is our way out.

What the fuck are you even talking about?  A criminal who fears arrest will not dump Bitcoin for fiat unless he's retarded.
The people you're talking about are not afraid of losing money.  They can print all the "money" they want.  They're afraid of losing power.  Their one-trick-pony show has failed them again and again, and they are terribly afraid right now.

That is, in fact, how all awesome discoveries and improvements are made from the Pythagorean Theorem to the Periodic Table to Newton's Laws of Thermodynamics to... well, everything.  All those folks were sitting around thinking, "Hey, what if..." many of them for their entire lifetimes.
The problem with science in 2019 is that it is a religion filled with scared little mice who are afraid to ask tough questions like, "What if Einstein was wrong (which it seems he was) and the Michelson-Morley experiment *is properly interpreted* as indicating that the Earth is stationary?"
Nobody would ever do that.  It would be heresy.
Instead, the "scientists" of today design and execute "experiments" that produce whatever results their corporate masters want them to produce.  There hasn't been a significant advancement in science since Crick tripped on acid and "what if"ed his way to the discovery of DNA.

That works with stocks and normie instruments.  Here's what's going to happen to you with Bitcoin:
You're going to take your little profit, probably tomorrow or maybe a week from now, then you're going to watch in horror and disbelief as the price doubles over the course of a month.  If you're smart, you'll FOMO back in at $18K or so, then freak out when it drops to $16K.  **Now here's the important part, the part on which your future hinges, your life-changing decision:** 
Take the red pill and buy the dip.  You will live in comfort and security for the rest of your life if you can stick it out for a year or two.  Or 
Take the blue pill and sell on whatever FUD is being pumped.  Watch the price go up for years, and tell stories as an old man about how you once sold millions of satoshis for a pittance.
The choice is yours.  But I can tell you from experience that "taking a profit" then watching the price skyrocket is a pretty bad feeling.
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:15:05
I think it's the most incisive and true meme of the decade.  "Non-player character" is exactly what most people are and how they live their lives.  They live in a loop -- doing the same things, going the same places, doing whatever they're programmed to do.  They can only do what they're programmed to do, exactly like NPCs in games.  Most people never have an original thought; they regurgitate whatever is on TV and in their "feed" (think about that word),  It's pathetic.
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:42:40

It's still better to keep a low profile.  Just sell a little bit to your local currency through an exchange or Bisq or whatever, then use your bank card.  A little caution goes a long way.
Maybe a good idea to carry a *tiny* bit of BTC in a mobile wallet when traveling in case of emergency but it's not something you'd want to flash around.

It's not the fault of "Keynesians," but yes, it's going to be horrific.  
It's not a Keynesian policy to bail out big banks as happened in 2008, nor is it a Keynesian policy to use debt to inflate asset bubbles.  Quite the opposite.  Keynes just said that aggregate demand should be increased during bad economic times through government spending.  There are a lot of good things that exist to this very day thanks to the [WPA](  Electricity is still being generated by the dams of the TVA.  Those Keynesian projects were, in fact, *excellent investments* that continue to pay dividends.  
The Fed pre-dates Keynes by a couple decades and has nothing to do with him or his policy prescriptions which are actually sound.  If we spent public funds building nice things instead of bombs and prisons, we'd have a lot more nice things.
@_date: 2019-08-13 22:53:11
Most people are, statistically.  If you bought Bitcoin on any of 98.6 percent of the days of its existence, you're well up.  If you sit tight for a couple months, every hodler presently reading this will be "up," not that it matters.

You are wrong.  Your credit card history is available to anyone who pays for it (like insurance companies and private investigators do) or any government agent who requests it.  It includes your name and what you bought.
Most modern wallets generate a unique address for every transaction.  Even if you knew my wallet address, you'd still have to track down the other end of the transaction to see what I bought.  
In addition to all that, Bitcoin can easily be mixed and sent to a fresh wallet, and LN transactions are 100% private.

This story is bullshit.  It's the same old bankster manipulators and their PR firms doing the same old one-trick-pony trick.  Didn't work last year or the year before that or the year before that.  Sure as hell won't work this year.  They're giving their money away again.  Take it.
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:41:15
Well, it worked for 10 years.  Now the chickens are coming home to roost.
It's still not classical Keynesian economics.  Keynes was not in favor of bankers running the economy.  He was more about fiscal spending, and, yes, I have read [A Treatise on Money]( and other works by him.  The idea is that spending should be encouraged and savings discouraged during downturns, not that this should be a permanent situation.

Probably the same someone that didn't want it to reach 4K, 6K, 8K, 10K and so on.
Next year the denominations will be 10K.  It will go from 20K to 30K to 60K to 30K to 80K... There will be wild 10K swings in single days.  It's going to be fun.
@_date: 2019-08-24 13:00:35

Control by politicians, bureaucrats, and bankers over "my" money is a big part of the reason I buy Bitcoin.  
A buddy of mine lost his job in the 2008 fiasco and dipped into his 401(k) to pay his bills.  He was hit with a massive bill from the IRS for early withdrawal penalties, and the worst part was that his 401(k) had LOST half its value when he was drawing it down.  He didn't have capital gains but still owed a ridiculous amount of taxes.  
**ANY WAY YOU CUT IT, THAT IS ALL KINDS OF BULLSHIT!**
He earned that money.  He did the right thing like a good little NPC and contributed to his "retirement plan."  When he needed the money, he was penalized for using it, even in its diminished form.
When you put Bitcoin in your wallet, it's yours.  You can do whatever you want with it.  If you sell it (usually with a nice gain), you can do so in a way that incurs no taxes.  If my buddy had been selling Bitcoin instead of cashing out his IRA, he could have taken gains less than the minimum taxable amount, paid his bills, and not gone bankrupt or had his wages garnished for years afterwards.  
Every satoshi you acquire is a vote against the ridiculous system of economic slavery that has been imposed on us.

Yep, borrow as much cheap fiat as they'll lend you while it still has value and buy Bitcoin.
You're wrong about cash though. Physical cash will be more valuable in the early days (the first year) of the crisis when the bank networks go down. Everybody should keep some physical cash in small bills.
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:31:08
Bitcoin was invented as a direct response to the 2008 crisis.  The message in the Genesis block makes that fairly clear.
It is at present the safest place to keep your money as long as you keep it in a cold wallet that you control (not your keys, not your coins).
It's not a bad idea to take some low-interest debt and buy Bitcoin right now as long as you can service the debt comfortably and deal with the occasional dips.  We could (not likely but anything is possible) fall down to $5K again.  Are you prepared for that?  In the long term, it will go up.  If you are willing to hold for three years, you will see massive gains.
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:48:29
Yeah, just hodl and buy the dip. This will snap back in up. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next week, but it will surge upward at some point. Whatever you do, don't let them have your coins.

DCA doesn't necessarily mean buying every week. I DCA on dips only. Did not buy anything from October 2017 until February 2018. Bought all 6k dips last year. Bought 3.3 and 3.5 this year. Bought 7.5 a few weeks ago. 
Then you sell tiny bits on big green spikes but never more than the amout of your next DCA buy.

I don't really have any interest in luxury items so it's easy.  I drive a non-luxury car that is paid for, live in a modest apartment, wear off the rack clothes, and that's fine.  None of that has changed as Bitcoin has gone up in price, and it's unlikely to change.
Money is just a trap if all you think about is buying more expensive things.  All you're doing is painting the bars of your cage gold.  You have to think in terms of freedom and the ability to effect positive change in the world if you want to be truly rich.

It's not about money. It's about ultimately defeating the inefficient, brutal, and unjust way in which the financial system works. Sure, we'll all be rich after all is said and done, but that's not the point. Even no-coiners will be better off without banksters literally enslaving them.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:51:50
The only ones losing money are the ones who dump, like the ones who dumped all that BTC at $3200 a few months ago or $6000 a year ago.  The guys dumping now are going to catapult us over $20K when they cover.
PS - you do realize that Bitcoin is the best-performing asset year to date, right?  Or maybe you think those sweet 5% gainz on stocks stack up against 300 percent for BTC which you probably do since your mathematical literacy is somewhere in the range of [0,-10] like most no-coiner losers.

Exactly.  The "gold standard" has been tried many times dating back to ancient times.  What ALWAYS happens is that banks print more notes than they have gold for backing.

I don't know if we'll see a BGD today, but we will see one.  More than one. 
We should thank these price suppressors. They're giving a lot of people a chance to stack sats cheaply and get a seat on the life boat before the global financial ship goes down.
By December, buying $8K will be like buying $3K is today. People will be like, "Damn! I should have bought more when it was only $3K a few months ago!"
And don't worry about Bitcoin.  It will go up a lot just as surely as the sun will rise in the east.  It's just a question of when.

Not so much.  There's only so much Bitcoin.  You can print a trillion dollars, but if you want to dump Bitcoin, you gotta have Bitcoin to dump. If Bitcoin whales aren't selling, well, tough shit for you and your fake money.

Zoom out three years or even two. 
Zoom in on that big spike up to $1000 in 2013 and notice the extended bear market that followed it. You're calling us dumb? A lot of us could pay you enough to humiliate yourself in a million different ways thanks to Bitcoin. Lucky for you, we have better things to do.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:09:38

Terrorists get paid in dollars for the most part.  
There is nothing illegal about Bitcoin.  Not. One. Thing.  Trying to ban it will result in embarrassing court cases that will show the government to be toothless and inferior for trying to suppress the new technology.  Smart governments will embrace Bitcoin and blockchain and prosper greatly for doing so.
Don't worry.  In a couple years, we will be buying politicians of our own, and the world will be much better for it.  Some useless government workers will have to find honest work, but that will be to everyone's benefit in the end.

Truly disruptive technologies are not widely recognized or adopted until at least ten years after their introduction.  
People used to make fun of kids who had personal computers back in the early '80s.  By the mid-90s, everybody had a computer, and a lot of people even had Internet access.
E-mail was a hard sell in the early '90s, even though it had been around for a while.  By the end of the decade, it was ubiquitous in business.
Cell phones were considered obnoxious in the mid '90s when they first became commercially viable.  
It's always, a "*Why do I need that when I already have this?*" objection by the masses.  Why do I need a PC?  I already have a typewriter and Atari?  Why do I need e-mail?  I already have a fax machine.  Why do I need a cell phone? I already have an answering machine, and there are pay phones everywhere.
Bitcoin will be no different.

You're free to be whatever you want, and somebody else is free to find humor in it. If you are true to yourself, you won't care what they think. And I didn't see anything hateful or offensive in the joke, by the way.

That is what happened earlier this year.  It will happen again but from a higher starting point.  The top will be much higher too because they've dumped a lot more BTC this year.

Life is longer than five months, dude.  Ask anyone who bought in early 2014 and waited until late 2016.  Think of it as a 36-month CD that returns thousands of percent.
That's not even the point though.  The point is that the current monetary system is completely effed up and enslaves people.  Bitcoin will free us from the inbred psychopaths currently in charge of the money system.  It's not about you and your little "investment," man.

I AM (patiently, on dumps not pumps).  Currently have an order at 3600 which has been moved up from 3000.  Will probably move it up again after the next pump.  Market bought a little at 3200 and 3500.  
@_date: 2019-02-09 02:35:06
It won't be a "feudal overlord" situation, but many of us will be working hard.  Since we came by our money honestly (as opposed to having been born into it), I think we will be better rulers than the current ones in terms of generosity and social conscience.  
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:04:24
The vast majority of shorts got rekt even during the bear market.  We're not in a bear market anymore.
Shorting is valid as a hedge.  You buy $100 million worth of BTC, plunk $10 million down at 10x leverage on a short.  If it goes down, you don't really lose.  If it goes up, you lose $10 million (but gain a lot more).
People who short to "make munniez cuz duh Buttcoin go down" are fucking idiots who deserve their poverty.
@_date: 2019-10-19 14:18:22
Same here. I look at charts a few times a day for a few minutes each time. The price doesn't matter. If it goes down, I buy. When it doubles or triples, I might sell a little bit.

If it's two years, Bitcoin is up 1200 percent.  So yes, there is a bit of a difference.  Even 18 months ago, you're probably still up unless you were the one unlucky person who bought that wick.

I know that a lot of people here are not American, but I just have to say that as an American, it bugs the heck out of me that our Independence Day is now almost universally known as the "Fourth of July."  Do people not know the significance of the event that this day honors?  A ragtag bunch of intellectuals put their lives on the line to challenge the most powerful economic and military empire in the world ON PRINCIPLE, not because they were starving.
I have a private tradition of buying Bitcoin on Independence Day as a way of declaring my own independence.  Let's make this year a global Financial Independence Day.  Everybody buy on the 4th of July!
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:51:34

It's not speculative at all. It's completely real.  Some people are good at math and analysis who make money.  Others are degenerate gamblers who lose money.
In the Bitcoin market, it's super simple: Buy and hold for at least 36 months.  The biggest, richest banksters in the world will eventually get rekt beyond belief trying to short this market or taking long profits too soon.
@_date: 2019-02-24 02:40:57
Smart contracts would vastly simplify paperwork for one thing.  Have you ever bought real estate? It's a nightmare shuffling papers and payments back and forth with two layers of middlemen on both sides of the deal.  It's just one area where the blockchain will add a lot of efficiency.
Stocks and bonds will also be tokenized after the next crisis.  The ledgers are messed up.  We have the technology to do this much more efficiently and fairly.  This story is not a one-off  
Blockchain is an even bigger invention than the Internet in terms of the effect it will have on society.  The world will be a much better place with less corruption, less parasitical waste, and far greater access to anonymized bulk data.

That's not the end game.  Bitcoin will outlast the dollar.  Within ten years, all major commodities will be priced in Bitcoin.  It just makes sense since its supply is known, unlike the supply of any fiat currency.

Shut up.  Just deal with it like you would cash.  As long has he records the sale and pays the sales tax, he's fine.  Years down the road if he sells, he can claim a capital gain (or not, frankly -- since there's no  KYC attached the wallet, the IRS has zero way to know about the transaction).

Bitcoin won't be used for lending. Other tokens will assume that role. To be suitable for lending, it pretty much has to have an unlimited supply because interest requires that more money constantly be added to the system. This is why fiat currencies lose value over time (inflation).
People who borrow mass quantities of Bitcoin to sell it short are nuts. Some of them are in for a very rude awakending.
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:07:18

The highest long term cap gains rate is currently 18% in the US.  If you have no income, you can have gains up to $37,000 with a 0% cap gains rate.  If you live overseas, that figure goes up to $108,000.
In your scenario, "Cashing out" more than needed would be stupid because you'd be missing out on future gains and because you'd be handing 18% over to Uncle Sam.
For Americans, a better strategy would be to move overseas somewhere where you can live well on $100K, cash out that much and wait for a year or two.

You haven't lost anything unless you sold.  
My advice to newbs: Just buy small amounts regularly and don't even think about trading until you've held for 36 months and are up thousands of percent.
I trade a little bit on the stack I bought in 2014, but it's just like playing the horsies with house money.  If you're trading and haven't already built up a solidly-in-the-black long-term hodl stack, you're still thinking in terms of fiat which means you don't have the foggiest clue what you're trading and should therefore probably not be trading it.  Personally, I only trade to get more BTC.  I could gaf about the price in fiat terms.

Most centralized exchanges will be out of business within a few years.  They're not really relevant to the ecosystem.  Many of them are selling more Bitcoin than they actually have and will be "Goxed" eventually. The only reason to send coin to an exchange is if you need fiat, and if you have coin on an exchange, you should get it off.
Bitcoin will still work when the banking settlement layer is so messed up that ATMs and credit cards are frequently not usable. That day is coming.  The writing is on the wall.  The settlement layer is messed up.  It's a gigantic, tangled web of inter-bank lending that can and will go *kaput* at some point.  If you're not holding at least a little bit of Bitcoin, you will regret it not because the value will skyrocket but because you won't have access to money.
If you absolutely refuse to buy Bitcoin, you should at least make sure to always have some physical cash on hand because when this happens, it will happen without warning.  This Wells Fargo story (and others) is about as much warning as you'll get.

I once sold almost all my Bitcoin at a 400% profit, then watched it double and double and double again.  I won't be making that mistake again.
It's not really comparable to a stock for many reasons, one of which is that the goal is not to make dollars but to get rid of dollars, at least after a few years in the game.

You must be new at this. When Bitcoin wakes up, it does so in spectacular fashion. The price could double in a week, then double agoin three more times over the next year. That would put us at $56K within a year.

Bears are running scared.).

They're not profiting. They're losing money hand over fist.  The dump from yesterday is already underwater, and if you look at the volume, it hasn't begun to be covered (bought back) so if you shorted that, you lost.
Likewise, the big dump in November has not been covered.  That will be very expensive for them.
The only way to dump the price is to either quietly buy a bunch of BTC over the counter, paying a premium over the spot price, then sell it at a loss, or you could borrow BTC and dump it, but then you have to pay it back.  
Look at the order books.  Lots and lots of money lined up to buy $1000-2500.  Those are big boys hoping to cover shorts profitably.  They won't. They're going to lose their asses, and it will be hilarious.
Edit: Why are they doing this, losing billions trying to suppress the Bitcoin price?  Because they know as well as the biggest moon boy on this sub that Bitcoin threatens their privileged position.  We should thank them.  This 14-month fool's errand has redistributed a lot of bankster wealth to working people all over the world.

When there is a recession, you will need money to buy food, and your bank card might not work so well.

No he doesn't.  Unless you think the percentage "aggregated in exchange wallets" or number-of-wallets/whale ratio has increased, this metric points to only one logical conclusion: Bitcoin wealth is being spread.

Demand for dollars globally is high.  That is "exporting inflation away."  If everybody needs dollars to buy oil, the wanton "printing" done by the Fed and its member banks can be sustained.  
It's a very flimsy house of cards.  There are many breezes that could come along and blow it down in an instant including: a banking crisis, a credit crisis, a drastic change in the current account balance (like mass crop failure in the Midwest, tariffs, or anything else that upsets the balance of trade), an unexpected and humiliating military defeat, and many more.  
If Americans want to avoid sliding into Third World status overnight, we should prepare for this contingency because right now the only thing propping up our way of life is the dollar.  I buy Bitcoin because I'm a realistic patriot who wants to be able to maintain a high standard of living in all scenarios.

They short it on paper, borrow a bunch of BTC and dump it at a loss, then use the profits from their paper shorts to pay back the BTC they dumped.  It's the oldest scam in the book.  They've been doing it with metals for centuries.  Much easier to do with metals because nobody wants to deal with them physically.
Look for a big pump on Friday after they start covering their spot shorts.  Buy now.  Send to cold storage.  Forget about it for a few months.

If the power grid goes out all over the world -- or the Internet for that matter -- we will not be worrying about money.  We'll be worried about survival.

Bitcoin is rare and valuable.  Bankster shit money is printed from farts and becoming less valuable every day.  If they plan on making Bitcoin so cheap that a 51 percent attack will be possible, the clock is ticking.

Bitcoin is pretty private compared to a bank which sells your intimate financial details to any Tom, Dick or Harry who pays.

Don't think they're taking profit.  Looks more like they're intentionally trying to dump the price.  Taking profit would be done more slowly by someone legitimately trying to get the best price.

To sell Bitcoin, one must buy (or mine) Bitcoin.  Since it's obvious that the recent dumpers did not buy (they borrowed -- if they had bought the price would have gone much higher before they dumped), we can assume that they will do so in a few months, just as they did when they covered their big November-December 2018 dump starting in April.
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:53:59

Somebody doesn't understand Bitcoin.  A network hundreds of times more powerful than every machine in every Amazon and Google data center combined securing your money has no value?  If Google and Amazon combined every computer they have, from employee laptops to massive data centers, and mined Bitcoin, they would control about 5 percent of the hash power.  No value in that. Much better to keep it in some banker's editable database.  
Controlling your own money without need of any middlemen, being able to send it anywhere in the world in any amount almost instantly and at 1/100th the cost (talking about large transactions) of what a banker would charge in a matter of minutes instead of days? Yeah, no value in that.  
Bitcoin is not a stock or bond. This is true.  But it is most definitely an investment, especially now that it's massively undervalued.

For things that require taxes, like local roads and schools, sales taxes and use taxes (water bills or tolls on bridges, for examples) should cover it.
Income tax is just an excuse for the government to rape you up the butt with regard to your financial privacy/sovereignty and a means for the Fed to turn you into their slave.  
People and governments of the world need to tell central banks to go fuck themselves.

So HODL until you don't need a job, then only sell up to the point where you have a gain under the minimum.  Better yet, live overseas where the first $108,000 is not taxable and advocate for tax reform from your beach house in Cancun.  Problem solved.

What if you had bought it two years before you did? It would have gained 1000 percent. Patience is a virtue that happens to be damn profitable when it comes to Bitcoin. This is not "get rich quick," it's "get rich slowly and patiently."

The word will still exist, the same way the word "doubloon" still exists.  The currency in its current form? Most likely not.  I'm rooting for a cryptodollar issued in an amount determined by Congress to cover the Federal budget (Yay, no taxes!).  Hey, we're still going to need roads and bridges and stuff, and Bitcoin will be so rare and precious by then that it won't work as a day-to-day currency.

You'd be stupid to sell everything at $50K in either scenario.  
It depends on how long you've held, your income, what kinds of tops and lows we have between here and there and all kinds of things.  Easiest way to avoid paying taxes is to never realize gains (never sell).  Within five years they'll have to rewrite the tax laws or all the Bitcoiners will simply repatriate to the most optimal Citidels.  I'd hodl that long if I were you.
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:18:59
Good deal.
That's the thing about Bitcoin: It's better. Once you use it, this becomes plain as day.  It's similar to e-mail back in the day.  People be like, "B... bu... but I already have a fax machine?" And you're like, "Nah. This is better, bro."  
Then they try it for themselves and... yeah, that's how new tech catches on.

You don't have to sell to buy a Lambo.  They take Bitcoin. That's where the meme originated.  So if you bought $10,000 worth of Bitcoin when it was $200 or less, you can spend it on a Lambo directly.

Why do you prefer a 401(k) to a pension?
My Roth IRA has done far better than my 401(k), and all those gains are tax-free.  401(k)s are a massive scam, forcing you to pay fees and "invest" in shit that you don't even know you're propping up.  Oh, and they get massacred in market turndowns, by the way.  Ask anyone who retired (or hoped to) between 2001 and 2008.
But my Bitcoin has kicked the ever-living shit out of everything else over the past five years, even after the "crash."  I'm buying as much as I can for the first time in years because I know damn well how this movie ends.

The dollar BILL (the physical, paper thing) will never go to 0.  In fact, it is likely to increase in value when the banks start to sputter.   Not easy to pay for things online with paper money.  That's where Bitcoin will shine.

What wallet do you find difficult to use from a UI/UX perspective?  They're all pretty straighforwared.  Hit the big fat "Send" button and scan the recipient's QR code or hit the big fat "Receive" button and let them scan yours.  I find my bank's app supremely inferior in that regard.  NFC is even easier -- just tap phones.
Once you pay for something with Bitcoin, you'll look at Venmo, PayPal, credit cards and all that stuff with a sense of disdain, like looking at the old guy trying to use the fax machine back in '93 when you tried like hell to tell him how much easier/better e-mail was.

Not everyone will need a cold storage device just as not everyone "needs" a bank account.  Most people will want a cold storage mechanism.  You'll walk around with a little bit on your mobile device and keep the rest unconnected to the Internet.  Doesn't even need to be anything fancy -- just an encrypted file on a USB thumb drive will do.  
The point is, you don't want to store your private key on the Internet.  I think it's a valid point, but for most people, Coinbase's solution is good enough.

The question is too general.
If you are just running a Bitcoin node at that address (like from a Raspberry Pi or VPS), no, there is no danger.  If you are running a Bitcoin node off your work laptop, probably no danger.  If you are running a Bitcoin node on a compromised machine with an open telnet port granting root access to anyone who knows your IP, yes, danger.  But you're probably not doing that.  
You're not really directly susceptible to attack. Your IP address is known and scanned regularly by really bad guys.  So go ahead and tell them.

Mass adoption will happen out of necessity when the banks collapse -- which is on the horizon. Serious problems exist in traditional financial ledgers, just the problem Bitcoin and blockchain were meant to solve. 
People will be much more amenable to peer-to-peer money when these problems become apparent in the form of not being able to use bank cards, payments not hitting accounts in a timely manner, bail ins/outs and the like.

Doing it wrong.  The only reason to put it on an exchange is to sell it. You should be taking it off exchanges if you intend to keep it.  Exchanges do shady things with the coins entrusted to them.
Sell those coins if that's your intention.  Move them to cold storage if you don't need the fiat.  Don't get Goxed or QuadrigaXed.
The article is not nonsense.  It shows that more retail investors are in the game and buying this generous discount.

Imagine what it would feel like if you had bought in at $800 and kept buying all the way down to $200 and had to wait two years before it recovered.  You kids today have it pretty good in comparison.  Wait a couple years, big dips will just help you get over the regret you'll have for not having bought more now.
Also -- don't let the price of Bitcoin have anything whatsoever to do with your emotional well being.  Just go live your life and forget about it.  Time heals all wounds.

You guys need to stop watching Bitcoin all the time.  Just check in every few hours or days, buy every couple weeks, and live your life.  That's the key to Lambo dune buggies on the moon (oh yeah, they'll make a moon buggy if we ask them).
Bitcoin will do its thing over time -- go up in value.  If you're in it for the money, just think of it as a 36-month CD that pays thousands of percent.  You don't check your money market fund all the time to see those sweet, sweet 2% annual gains, do you?  Same diff.  Live.

Bitcoin won't be used for loans. It's too rare and credit demands an inflationary currency otherwise interest doesn't work mathematically. 
Some other crypto will be used for lending and spending. Bitcoin will be used for wealth preservation and settling very large accounts.

If you're thinking of pulling the plug, you should probably do that because you're invested in something you don't understand.
Anyway, where else are you going to put your money? BTC is the only thing in my portfolio that has gained value in the past six months, and it has gained over 100 percent in that time.
Go ahead and pull the plug on that. Good luck finding a better place to park your money.

Yes it is. Never lend your BTC. If you're keeping it on an exchange, you're lending it. Expect more of this as the shorties pay exchanges to borrow BTC that they never intend to repay after they dump it. Buy the BTC, then send it to your wallet. Never trust an exchange.

Once 10K fell there were a ton of liquidations (from the people who were shorting like mad to keep it under 8K and 9K) that sent it over 11K.  Now they're fighting 11K and will be liquidated again around 13K.  Could take a few weeks.

@_date: 2019-06-15 23:15:16
Bitcoin will always go up in value over time as long as the supply is constrained to 21 million coins.  Demand will not decrease any time soon and after Bitcoin takes over as the standard settlement layer for all large financial transactions (within ten years), it will only grow.  People will save Bitcoin for big purchases and spend other currencies for little things.  Hodling is almost built in to the protocol.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:20:02
Never. Sell.  Certainly not until you've held for at least a year, preferably two.

Fiat can't move to many exchanges on weekends, at least in large amounts, so whales use that opportunity to load up without much slippage (FOMO money can't rush in to run the price up as they're buying).   Conversely, bearwhales can easily move BTC to exchanges on the weekends to tamp down any pumps, further reducing slippage.

This meme is the most sound financial advice ever given.  Anybody who held any amount of Bitcoin for five years made ridiculous returns, from any point in Bitcoin's history.

Crypto isn't a "financial product or service."  There are products and services built around it, and those should be regulated.  Bitcoin itself shouldn't (couldn't and can't) be regulated any more than magic beans or sea shells or any potential medium of exchange is regulated.
I want protection from the bankster criminals so I'm glad they're semi-regulated.  As for "protecting (me from myself)" just fuck right off.  That's the kind of attitude that results in stupid, lazy, unskilled people who push around spreadsheets and conduct pointless meetings all day instead of adding actual value to an enterprise.
@_date: 2019-02-26 21:28:39
Large block size is a terrible solution that significantly diminishes the security of the network by making it prohibitively expensive to run a node.  Just look at BCash.  It would be trivial to 51% attack it at this point, and security will only get worse as people decide, "Fuck this.  I'm not storing 10TB of transactions" and leave the network.  It's already like four people controlling the whole thing -- a total joke.
LN is extremely decentralized. Anybody with a node can open a channel.  Seven channel closings per second should be more than enough if each settlement contains thousands or tens of thousands of transactions.  It's orders of magnitude more capacity than Visa or MC have today.
The poorest people in the world will be among the biggest beneficiaries even after the price moons.  This is part of the reason that not all shitcoins will die.  Unbanked places and people will be instantly "banked" in a world where banks are relics of the past.  
@_date: 2019-02-14 13:35:10
Not pointless. Unless you can show that people are more likely to split their coins into multiple wallets than they were a couple years ago when the price was rising (which makes no sense because people would have been putting eggs in different baskets when the price was going up, not as much on the way down), this is an extremely valid metric.
TLDR -- people have always split coins into smaller wallets.  there is no reason to think they're doing this more now than before.  ergo, more people are buying Bitcoin in smaller amounts, and wealth is being distributed more equitably.

You really should look into some of that "hippy shit," man.  There's 5000 years of clinical data behind some of it, and death by doctor is the leading cause of death in America thanks to Rockefeller's scam AMA monopoly on health care.
I was told by two MDs that I would absolutely need surgery for... not to dox myself... but let's just say an "issue," one of these MDs was a Beverly Hills/Park Ave. world-renowned "expert."  I said, "Well, let me try the non-aggressive approach for a couple months and see what happens."
You know what? I was cured by an old Chinese man with a combination of acupuncture, herbs and exercise within three months where "modern medicine" had failed for a year.  My doctors were stunned.
Steve Jobs lived for 11 years after a diagnosis (Stage 2 pancreatic cancer) where the prognosis is 18 months even with aggressive treatment.  He went to hippy doctors.  Go figure.

Traders are losers.  Hodlers have far better returns.
Every hodler goes through a dark period, sometimes lasting many months, when they question their decision.  Your dark period will not be long.
In time your goal will not be to obtain dollars but to get as much BTC as you can.

Kind of, but the price at which the contract is set is what really matters because the real purpose is to suppress the price in the spot markets.  They keep setting the futures price down, moving hundreds of millions of dollars in, then spot bots follow due to the sums of money involved.  As a "gentleman's agreement," the winner takes a few bucks and the loser loses a few bucks but that's all bullshit: the real purpose of the contracts is to suppress/control prices of commodities.  Bitcoin won't cooperate so easily, they will find.
TLDR; -- If the horseshit fake paper Bitcoin settlement price is $3600 but the real price is not cooperating, you've got some very rekt rich guys.

Bears have trapped themselves into another great year for bulls.  
Remember when we ran up from $4K to $13.6K earlier this year?  Next time we'll be running up from $8K to $28K, and it won't pull back as far due to the halving.  If you can hodl any amount of BTC until 12/2021, u rich.
But it's not about being rich which is really a state of mind having nothing to do with any arbitrary number.  Remember to take care of the less fortunate when the wheels come off the traditional financial system in 2020.

Anything that needs rock-solid verification and an un-alterable quasi-anonymous public record.  Here are a few uses off the top of my head:
* Voting -- you show up at the polling place with your key, cast your vote and can verify it any time, from anywhere.  Over time, political scientists would have a perfect anonymized record of voting patterns in every election
* Medical records -- your doctor records test results and the like in a public blockchain.  The records are anonymized but available to researchers.  Would be much better than storing all this stuff in an old fashioned database or databases with personal info attached.  Only you, your doctor and perhaps your insurance company would be able to associate your key with you.
* Real estate deeds -- in some parts of the world, there is a big problem with men with guns showing up and saying to subsistence farmers, "This land is ours." Because public records are so poor, the farmer often has no recourse.  This (blockchain-stored deeds) is actually already being done in parts of Africa.
* Stocks and bonds -- right now it's stupid how many middlemen and "trusted" third parties are needed to make the markets work.  [Nobody is actually sure how many shares exists](  If stocks were tokenized, we could trade them back and forth just as we do cryptocurrencies currently. It would be like holding the stock certificate, not an IOU from your broker.
* Tracking art and other collectibles
* And on and on
This technology will transform the world more fundamentally than did the Internet itself.  It is a profound advancement in human history, the ability to keep perfect, incorruptible public records that can also be anonymized.

That green spike the other day won't be the last of its kind, and it won't be the biggest one we see.  That was only $100 mil which is not a lot of money to someone who's trying to shield their wealth from the impending collapse of the dollar and western banking system.

They can see how much you spend but not necessarily the details -- they probably don't know the party on the other side of the transaction.  It's not perfect, but at least it makes them work for it, unlike your bank who pimps your intimate financial data out to anybody who pays them a few bucks.

The fact that Litecoin is a survivor says A LOT.  I won't even consider a coin that hasn't been around for 5 years.  Thousands have come and gone in that time.

No-coiner spotted.
Bitcoin will eventually win because it's MUCH EASIER than traditional Monopoly Bank money.  It's also faster, more secure, vastly more private, etc.

I'm pretty sure they're as fractional as Mt. Gox.  200K BTC changes hands on Coinbase every month.  Does anybody think that a large proportion of that is NOT borrowed from the cold wallet by the banksters shorting it?
I mean, hodlers ain't selling.  It's staying in wallets, but somehow somebody always has 20K BTC to dump.

That doesn't even matter.  Coinbase has 800,000 BTC in its cold wallet, but more than 200,000 BTC change hands there every month.  
What we don't know is how much they owe to their customers.  If they have 800,000 BTC, it doesn't matter if people are (stupidly) holding 1M "BTC" on their exchange.  With over 20 million customers, I think they might owe (what's in their customers' wallets) a lot more than they have.  Institutional investors would have to be insane to trust Coinbase Custody.  They're lending that shit out to shorters.
One thing is for sure: somebody is selling a lot more Bitcoin than they have.  Just look at the daily volume and compare with the total amount of Bitcoin, 65% of which has not moved in over a year.

**When** Bitcoin moons a lot of people are going to learn hard lessons about a  big part of why Bitcoin exists: not having to trust corruptible third parties with your money.
I *guarantee* you that many exchanges are selling more BTC than they have on hand.  The only thing keeping them afloat is that people are trusting them with their BTC.  Use exchanges for their intended purpose: buying and selling.  They're not banks. 
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:07:44
They won't be able to do that.  Ripple is a non-starter unless it becomes a "stable coin" pegged to a local currency.   Also, they're basically using a glorified Excel spreadsheet with multiple middlemen and clearing houses.  This "spreadsheet" would quickly get out of whack if it didn't have little reset periods for transactions to settle in all the places they need to settle (the interbank lending market, the central banks, etc).
Bitcoin will always be better than banks because you're either going to have one rock-solid "middleman" in the form of the Lightning Network or no middleman at all.

You shouldn't be thinking in terms of fiat.  Your goal should be to get as much BTC as you can before it moons again (which it will as surely as the sun will rise -- it's just a question of when).

Oh, it will drop a little here and there on the way back to five figures (forever... well, until six figures, anyway), but don't expect any big dumps.  One was tried last week.  It resulted in a very temporary $50 discount.  It's pretty clear that some big money is entering, probably because they know something you don't about the banking system.

Vast amounts of Bitcoin that have been borrowed and shorted since June will start being repaid this winter.  At the same time, miners will be holding back on coins in anticipation of the halving.

It doesn't matter.  It still boils down to supply and demand.  They can push the price down for a while, but they have to pay back the borrowed BTC.
It's very, very important to send your BTC to cold storage to remove it from the available float.  The exchange can and will lend it to shorters if you leave it there.

A trap is when you send a false signal, like, "Rally's over, we gave back 3% of our 25% gain.  Oh well."
Little do they know that all you did was short the top so that your next pump will be even bigger.  Meanwhile, they pile on and short the bottom, thusly "trapped" by the false signal.
By the way, Bitcoin has never been anything but a massive bear trap.  Many a bearwhale has been slain.  This current one is not unique, just bigger.  DuckDuckGo it.

I have to disagree strongly.  One of the macro problems that will be solved is that there is nowhere for the poor to put any extra money they might have.  Savings accounts are a joke, and many poor people are "unbanked" which is why you see check cashing places in poor neighborhoods even now.  
In the future, if I'm paying my employees in Bitcoin and they can discipline themselves to live within their means, they will be able to hodl their savings, and those will appreciate in value, maybe not as fast as over the past 10 years (or maybe so -- 21 million is a pretty small number) but it will give them an avenue to save their wealth in a way in which it is not sneakily stolen from them by bankers through inflation.
That's just one of many problems with the injustices of the current system that is fixed by Bitcoin.

It is really that simple.  Every dollar/euro/yen/yuan/etc in existence exists as a promissory note, a debt.  After this insane system collapses and Bitcoin takes over, Bitcoin will be worth roughly that much, assuming no GDP growth.
Of course, it won't just be Bitcoin, but if Bitcoin maintains 10 percent of crypto market share, we're looking at a million (in purchasing power -- the dollar itself will no longer be used) per BTC.

If I were a mega-whale, this is what I'd do right now:
1) Sneakily sell $50 million worth of BTC over a period of a few days, driving the price down by several hundred dollars before stopping the fire sale and letting the shorts and freakout boyz gleefully pile on with mega shorts.
2) Upon the first BRD or rise of $50 or more, buy back $50 mil in one big burst, stopping out all the shorts and driving us over $6K in one mighty "He is Risen" Easter burst.
But that's just me. *shrug*
@_date: 2019-04-16 12:18:01
There are 7 billion people on the planet.  One million is a pretty small number.  It means that 1/7000 people wakes up to the fact that Bitcoin is better money every month.  Sounds about right to me.

Banks will end up holding most of the Bitcoin in the end.  Those banks will be kept honest by Bitcoin -- can't fake anything with an immutable ledger, after all.  The ones today that are actively fighting it will no longer exist.
Banking is but one of many, many industries that will be made more profitable for society and individuals in the new system.
Any bank fighting Bitcoin today is signing its own death warrant.  Most of us on here won't need mortgages anyway since a dope-ass crib will go for like 5 million sats by 2023.
@_date: 2019-12-17 13:39:58
This is correct.  It's also important to spend and use Bitcoin since that is what gives it value.  
"They" can't dump paper Bitcoin forever.  At some point, they have to buy the real thing, and if there is none for sale, the price does what it did earlier this year.  
"They" will start covering the past six months of dumps within a month or two.  Hodl on.
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:14:33
Stuck market about to take another dump.  Should see some wealth flowing into the People's Money today.
(TLDR - Bitcoin's price should go up a bit today)
Edit: Then again, somebody is apparently able to sell mass amounts of BTC without ever buying it.  If your coins are stored on the Cash App or Coinbase or any other wallet not ultimately in your control, you have BINO (Bitcoin In Name Only), not Bitcoin.  Get your coins off exchanges so they can't lend them out to dumpers.

In a word: It encourages savings and discourages consumption.
If you know your money will buy more 2-3 years from now, you're likely to save it.  After it does appreciate, you will spend on quality, not quantity because you will be feeling richer.
As for miners, they will do just fine.  In a few years, they will be making most of their money off transaction costs if they're not already.  Eventually mining might even become more decentralized as more and smaller operations jump in to snag satoshis instead of having big mines trying to stack whole coins.
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:17:23
I agree with you.  Public services are necessary in a civilized society.  Somebody needs to keep law and order, teach the kids, pick up the garbage, pave the roads, treat the water and so on.
How about some common ground?  Get rid of *income taxes* and the invasion of privacy they represent and collect all taxes through use and consumption.  That way, those who spend the most pay the most. How about a financial transaction tax of .1 percent on every stock, bond, and crypto purchase?  That would probably pay for everything.
Income taxes suck, especially in the U.S. where you have to fill out gobs of paperwork including a financial colon scan, bank account prostate exam, and if you mess one tiny little thing up, get audited and harassed for a year or maybe even thrown in jail.
It's bullshit, and it needs to change.

It's not always a bad idea to short.  There is a legitimate reason for shorting: hedging.  This is not what most amateur idiot "traders" do when they short Bitcoin.
If you were buying $100 million in BTC, you would do well to place a $10 million short with high leverage.  That way, if the price falls, you don't lose money on your big buy.  If the price doesn't fall, oh well, you lost a few million on the short but made much more on the long.  That is the only smart reason to short Bitcoin.  If it were a stock, a short might make sense if there were signs that the company was in trouble, but it's not a stock.  Shorting is stupid unless you're doing it as a hedge.

Next time Bitcoin moons, we need to throw some serious money at the political system and get these laws changed.

I honestly don't think they have the resources to track every purchase down, although I'm sure they could if they wanted to. 
Anyway, they're gift cards, right? As far as I know, gifts are not taxable up to a pretty high amount ($50000? Don't quote me on that!). I wouldn't worry about it unless you're laundering money or something, in which case, Bitcoin is probably not the best option.

There are escrow payments.  The payment doesn't finalize until the product or service is rendered satisfactorily.  Some of the Bitcoin freelance sites operate in this way.  If banks are smart (and they are, for the most part), they are probably exploring this right now as a way to preserve their "trusted middleman" status.  It will be necessary for larger payments.

Paradoxically, when I tell people about it, I'm trying to *prevent* them from being forced; I'm trying to exhort them to get involved by their own choice rather than be forced by circumstance.  The traditional financial system is looking very wobbly right now.  The more people have Bitcoin when the crash comes, the less severe will be the social impact. 
It's not going to be a fun day when the bail-ins start and everybody realizes that they've been hoodwinked.  Hopefully a high enough percentage of the population holds BTC (or a couple other decent coins) at that point that we can simply continue on with commerce and just let the banks die the ignominious death they deserve.

Same holds true for pumps if you want to gamble.  When it pumps a lot, sell a little and cross your fingers that you can buy back more cheaply.

The Fed could print a trillion dollars to buy up all the Bitcoin, and they still wouldn't get mine.  They'd get a lot of it, but they wouldn't be the only ones buying as the price climbed toward a million.
If they then dumped it from a million to $100,000, I'd use my profits to buy back more than I had previously.
Even the Fed and their magic bullshit money couldn't kill Bitcoin.  All they could do is drive the price way up, then dump it to a level much higher than now, as has happened before.  That's the difference between a supply controlled by math vs a supply controlled by a bunch of inbred idiots.
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:51:35
Great comment.


Should have added "for the rich and upper-middle class."  The poor and working class don't have index funds, commodities, or businesses.  They put their money in CDs if they're lucky.  
In the coming Bitcoin world, they too will have a safe place to protect their money against inflation.
Even a lot of fairly well off people, like corporate executives, have most of their money tied up in houses that may not be worth more than they are today in a few years and retirement funds that will almost certainly lose the battle against inflation even if the market goes "up" in the next few years.
The traditional markets are a ticking time bomb.  Corporate debt levels are terrifying, and this represents most of the rise over the past ten years.  (Why does Apple have to borrow $150 billion?  To buy back its own shares, of course!)  I feel very sorry for people who have all their wealth tied up in trads.  They're about to get doinked up the dunghole in a huge way.

The IRS is a massive waste of money, and those people will need to find real jobs.  There should be plenty of new jobs.  It's going to be a very exciting, prosperous time once we rid ourselves of these scum sucking parasites on top.

Lots of businesses accept Bitcoin.  You can buy pretty much anything with it, and it's extremely easy to use.
In the event of a crash, businesses will start accepting Bitcoin or they won't be in business for long.  By 2022, most businesses will not accept credit cards.  It will be cash or crypto only.  By 2025, it will be crypto only.

You have obviously not used BTC lately if you're complaining about fees.  I doubt you've ever used it.  It is extremely inexpensive and fast to send BTC, especially comparing to fiat currencies.  In addition, it's far more secure.
If all I cared about was fast and cheap, I'd use Doge because it's faster and cheaper and more decentralized than counterfeit Bitcoin.

So you're saying people spend more money than they otherwise would if they didn't have high-interest cards in their wallets.  On goods that already cost too much thanks to the 5% or so extra merchants tack on to prices to pay the credit card processing tax.  And this is a good thing... how, exactly?  Oh, right, "economic activity" and "growth."  Economic activity is akin to cellular activity, and it's not always good.


That word "always" should tip you off that the assumption is incorrect.  There are two ways to make money: margin and volume.  Some merchants will go for the volume approach.  Even those going for high margin will price some items low, even sell at a loss, to draw consumers into their stores.
The bottom line is that quasi-anonymous peer-to-peer cash is a better technology with economic benefits to both merchants and consumers and will ultimately win for that reason.

Gold will have no value in a total collapse scenario.  Most people will actively avoid it since it will get you killed.
Bitcoin will buy you a plane ticket to somewhere safer.  It will allow you to order things online discreetly, things like food and electronics and tools if you want to take the chance and hang around.
One thing is for sure: if/when the economy collapses, Bitcoin will become a lot more valuable just like it shot up to $1000 for the first time in 2013 on the heels of the crises in Greece and Cyprus, just like it has in Zimbabwe and Venezuela.  
Oh, and if you think food and guns will save you from the marauding hordes, you're kidding yourself.  Guns will be sought after.  You'd better have a lot of them and an entire compound guarded 24 hours per day or 9 guys are going to kick your doors in some night and take your guns and whatever else you might have.  In the scenario you're imagining, you won't want to be staying in one place, and you will want to be able to blend in and not broadcast any measure of wealth to anyone.

There will be other coins, man, at least a few.  Doge will be one of them.  It's fast and cheap and decentralized.  Next time some BCasher or Ripple NPC comes at you about "fees" just suggest they use Doge since it has proved itself over many years of such moon.
Litecoin will be around.  It's decentralized, almost as secure as Bitcoin and faster and cheaper than BCash.  
Dash is my favorite privacy coin.  
Programmable money means you'll use different money for different things.  You might buy your car with Litecoin but your house with Bitcoin, use Doge to pay for coffee and Dash to pay for weed.  No need to be pedantic.

This is exactly the time to buy.  It's all about time in the market, not timing the market.  Could it go down further?  Sure.  In three years, it really won't matter much whether you bought at $9K or $6K or $7K, kind of like it doesn't matter much now whether you bought at $500, $300, or $900.

Demonstrably false.  We are maybe 1 percent of the global population at this point.  Plenty of room for growth.  Everyone here who hodls will get rich just as surely as those who hodled from 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016 got rich.  It's mathematically guaranteed.  Bitcoin is a thing.  By the time global adoption reaches 5%, literally everyone here now will be rich.  By the time it reaches 100% in 5-10 years, everyone here now will be... well, the 1%... except the no-coiners, shorters, and trolls, of course.

That's exactly how property rights work. If TD Ameritrade or any broker says I have 1000 shares of Company X, I have a right to demand paper stock certificates (akin to my Bitcoin keys -- certified, stamped, all that) proving that.  The same should be true of any crypto assets they are claiming to sell/trade.  If you want the actual thing of value and not an IOU from them, you have every right to it.

Keeping it in a safe deposit box isn't necessarily a good idea either as you may not have access to it when you really need it.  A full-blown banking crisis may or may not happen in the next couple of years, but if it does, you will want custody of your BTC at that time.

The Fed is a privately held corporation.  50% of your federal tax dollars go toward paying interest to its owners, about $90 million/hr to the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Morgans and so on so that they never have to do an honest day's work.

A global recession will likely come with, in this order: a debt crisis, a banking crisis, a currency crisis.
Bitcoin, being decoupled from traditional financial systems, will be an attractive safe haven.  Liquidity is extremely low as we witnessed with that $1000 green candle earlier this month, set off by a relatively small $100 million buy.  
TLDR; Bitcoin will moon if there is a global recession and likely end up replacing the current financial system.

6500 was near the bottom of a 10-month downswing.  If it couldn't get up from there, it was clear that it would go down.  If you look at some of my posts from the week before it dropped, I predicted that drop to the day.  
Lingering after a four-month uptrend is a different story, especially since it's lingering due to every dump attempt being bought up quickly.   With each failed dump and subsequent bounce, the permabears are digging themselves into a deeper and deeper hole.  When they try to climb out, we should see some spectacular upward movement.

I would guess that USD inflation is quite a bit higher than 3.79% but there's no way to tell for sure since nobody really has an exact handle on how many dollars are out there and how many are being brought into existence.  It's the main reason the dollar will lose to Bitcoin in the end.

Great questions!


1) For the first few years, maybe the first decade, from 2020 to 2030, say, yes, absolutely the distribution of wealth would look much like it does now (though not *quite* as bad)  But what will happen over time is that Bitcoin hodlers will feel rich and spend like drunken sailors.  This will gradually redistribute the wealth even more fairly.  It will be more fairly distributed than now from the outset, however.
2) The level of stupidity that borrows Bitcoin is beyond my ability to comprehend, even if I go "full retard."  It is a highly demanded *commodity* (not a pretend credit in some rich guy's Excel sheet) of extremely limited supply.  You will never be able to pay it off in the future, especially at this very early point.  Other tokens will be useful for lending, the ones with potentially unlimited supply.  Hard money like Bitcoin will not be used for lending in the coming crypto paradigm.  It will be used for saving.
3) I think I just did, but here's the distilled version: Bitcoin is the hardest, most advanced form of currency that has come into existence in the past 12,000 years or so.  If you do not have any, you are missing the best opportunity of your lifetime in the financial realm.  You may succeed in love or creativity, but you will not be rich 5 years from now if you are not buying Bitcoin today.
Thanks for your wonderful questions.

It makes perfect sense.  You just made the case for Bitcoin. Banks can't freeze your Bitcoin. Nobody will want to keep money in bank accounts by the time Bitcoin hits $1 mil.   There will be a full-blown banking crisis by then, and people will be standing in line at ATM machines to withdraw their low daily limit of cash. 
The flow of money will not be toward banks but away from them.  "Cashing out" to unstable, censorable fiat will be considered ridiculous.
Have you ever even used Bitcoin? It's a lot easier to spend than dollars in any form.

They need to be sued.  If the price of BTC (real BTC, not BTC IOUs) tanks after this product is launched (which it might), we need to get a class action lawsuit together.  They're misrepresenting their product as Bitcoin when it is no such thing.
Unless it is real Bitcoin (you can withdraw it to your wallet or TD Ameritrade can demonstrate that they have actual BTC in a wallet to back up their IOUs), in which case this could send us to the moon.

I don't watch the charts that closely.  Whatever their strategy, it is clear that somebody and a lot of somebodies are buying a lot of Bitcoin these days, and I don't see this as artificial in any way.  The dump in November was "artificial" in the sense that it was engineered and not done for profit, just to drive the price down.
What I see now is the same natural Bitcoin being Bitcoin that we've seen all these years.  I suppose even last year was like that too, just with bigger bearwhales.

It's not stealing.  It's giving back what you took.  Amazon uses public roads and infrastructure that was built with public funds, and most people who work there attended public schools.  Nobody got rich in a vacuum.  
What we need to do is get rid of the insane *income tax* system which is very much a form of theft and a massive invasion of everyone's privacy.  Taxes should be collected on consumption and transactions.  
Also the government shouldn't borrow a dime, let alone from a private banker like the Fed.  The government can print all the money it needs.  It doesn't need to take it from you and me, at least not on the Federal level.

I'm sure if it's someone planning to buy a few billion dollars worth (and it might well be -- a hedge fund, a central bank, or just a billionaire who knows that the jig is almost up for the banking system), they will be slow and strategic about it.
Expect more and bigger BGDs, and expect every dump to get bought up quickly.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:51:03
There are many, many levers of demand.  Central banks buying is just one.
Some billionaire could decide to buy a billion dollars worth and send the price to a new ATH in a hurry.  A hedge fund could do the same thing.  Good old fashioned FOMO of a few million people buying 500 bucks apiece...
There's no way we don't see a new ATH sooner than most expect, especially with all that borrowed Bitcoin out there needing to be repaid.

That's why "spend and replace" is kind of a thing.  You send it on March 30th and buy it back ASAP.
Anyway, if you sent it on March 30 but bought it in January, you actually only sent about $75K.  See how that works?  Buy regularly and hodl and you don't sweat it when you make somebody happy.  I love paying people with Bitcoin and watching the price run up shortly thereafter.
@_date: 2019-04-20 11:54:19


We do not.  We remember 2008 and will be ready when they do it again.  This is why crypto exists: because some highly intelligent people saw how evil it was that Jamie Dimon and his crooked pals took trillions in bailouts while millions of people lost their jobs, homes, and retirement savings.

We do, and part of it is bankruptcy, in which debtors have debts wiped clean.  Suppose you borrowed $1 billion worth of Bitcoin and dumped it in November, hoping to buy it back for under $1 billion.  But, oops, the price went up, and now you can't buy it back for under $5 billion.  You declare bankruptcy.  Whoever lent you the BTC is SOL.  
There is a LOT of borrowed BTC that won't be repaid.  A lot of it has been borrowed from exchanges.

Bullshit.  Laws are complex so that [anybody can be accused of breaking them at any time](  
When you really think about it, there is no need for a complex legal code.  
Fraud - illegal.  You misrepresented something and used that as a means of theft.
Theft - illegal.
Murder - illegal.
Rape - illegal.
Assault - illegal.
What do all these things have in common?  The perpetrator caused harm to another.  The only things that should be illegal are things that directly harm other people, and those are pretty simple to define and identify.  If we lived in a world where police simply chased down real criminals -- those who cause harm to others -- we would all be much safer.

These guys are just about ready to be squeezed.  Maybe let them dump more borrowed Bitcoin at a loss for another day or two, then you'll see some whale intervention.
Bitcoin is going to need a new house -- not enough room on the floor of the great room for this next bear rug.

No, it started at $.06. That was the first price somebody (lucky fucker) paid for Bitcoin.
If that curve is still too close to zero, start at $50 in 2012 or so. Same curve. $20k next year will look just like all those other ridiculous bubbles look now. They looked super big at the time.

Use it as your savings account for three years.  Any money you would have given to the bank for 2% interest, put in your Bitcoin wallet.  In three years, you'll be very glad you did.

Why don't you open a node or get a wallet and try it out?  Not only is it ready, it works great!

I sure hope so, but I think the banking system will totally collapse before then, at which point, Bitcoin will become extremely valuable because it will still work.

It has missed by a hair on at least three occasions, once by about ten bucks.  Moved it up to $5K which is $2k more than where it started back in January.  If it misses again, I'll just market buy in the morning before CME closes -- always good for a little bump.

Companies don't have intrinisic value.  Many of them are effectively bankrupt due to heavy borrowing and stock buybacks.  Look at GE.  That's the future, and GE hasn't even admitted that it's bankrupt yet even though it's painfully obvious from a quick glance at its financials.
I feel sorry for you.
@_date: 2019-04-30 12:59:25
If you have the key to Bitcoin that was not intended for you, that is either theft by you or carelessness on the part of the rightful owner of the keys.  
Either way, the Bitcoin is under your control, just as if you would have control of a car whose keys you stole or found.

Yeah, in the not-too-distant future, the slowness and "high" fees (still ridiculously low compared to banks) of on-chain transactions will be considered features, not bugs.

Nobody will ever have "all the Bitcoin."
I think in 10-20 years, all financial transactions will ultimately settle in Bitcoin.  It will be the main ledger.  Everything will be tokenized -- deeds, securities, commodities, bonds -- and profits and losses will be recorded in Bitcoin. So you buy your house token for .001 BTC (or whatever) and sell it for .0015 BTC.  
Why will everything be tokenized? Because the current ledgers are completely out of whack.  This will collapse at some point, and when it does, a better ledger and settlement technology will be waiting to take its place.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:34:21
It's banksters for sure.  Nobody else has that much money to lose (and they will lose it).

Probably true for the majority of them at this point. Most of them are dumb as boxes of rocks (probably the most annoying thing about them beyond their well coiffed hair is that they think they're soooo smart, and they're generally sooo not) and don't see the freight train yet.  
They will.  The next Lehman -- some big old player caught with its pants down on the wrong side of a crazy derivative it can't pay up on -- will scare the fuck out of them.  It will also make Bitcoin 10x as valuable pretty much overnight.
But you're right, most of those guys are way too dumb and arrogant to be scared at this point.

You'll see on Friday (if not sooner) when they start to buy back what they owe.  It will go up much more than it went down because nobody is actually selling except the dumpers.
It can be proved that short interest on Bitfinex went way up yesterday. That's thousands of borrowed BTC right there.  BitMex is the same.

This is true. 
Of course "they" are fine with it.  They get free money.  What do you get?  
The question is, are you just fine with it?  Do you like the fact that your paycheck buys less and less, that your house and everything else costs more and more?  If that's the world you want to live in, go for it.  Eventually it leads to your total enslavement and poverty.  Others will choose more sound money.  But hey, go ahead and be a dumbass.

Wire transfers are not the same as ACH.  They're a lot more expensive and slower.  ACH doesn't work internationally so this was a wire transfer, most likely.

Some do.  I am of the mind that the NSA created Bitcoin as a response to the crisis of 2008.  How else could Satoshi have remained anonymous even  to the CIA?
Fun fact: The NSA is the only alphabet agency that doesn't answer to the CIA or even the president.  Their mission is national security, and they take it very seriously.
@_date: 2018-11-10 16:49:44
I don't think the whole thing will collapse, but it's highly likely that there will be continued and worsening problems with the settlement networks.  "Money in the bank" won't necessarily be money that you can access all the time.
A financial crisis is definitely on the horizon though, and it will be worse than 2008.  A bailout will not be politically or economically feasible due to ten years of cheap money. It will be a bail-in. People are going to lose a lot.  The best protection you have against that is a bit of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:32:06
I was able to see the future in 2014 and 2015 when I bought most of my Bitcoin, though there was a good year or more of doubting myself. 
I now see the future much more clearly, and it's full of people like you offing yourselves because of your poverty and the fact that your arrogance and stupidity caused it. Do yourself a favor and get a little Bitcoin now just in case I'm right (I am). You've been warned.

@_date: 2018-11-17 23:30:48
That's fine.  Lots of people held through a worse bear market, and it turned out pretty well for us.
I absolutely guarantee you that Bitcoin will go on a mad run at some point.  Guarantee.  We've seen worse than 2018.  If you had told me in November 2016 that Bitcoin would be worth five thousand dollars today, I'd have been delighted.
@_date: 2018-11-10 00:59:48
That's literally the dumbest thing you could do because Bitcoin can explode upward at any moment, and you're left holding a bag of Monopoly money.  I know.  I've done it.  
@_date: 2018-11-10 16:47:16
Banking networks work based on a complicated system of settlements.  Money gets deleted here and added there.  All of these recent glitches in bank networks reveal some sort of issue with those settlements.  At some point, those networks will fail to function properly. People won't be able to access their money.  Bitcoin will still work.

@_date: 2018-11-25 00:33:41
Not at all, dude.  Buy something with Bitcoin. You'll never want to hassle with a credit card again.
Except you're probably a no coiner, in which case I pity you.  You'll probably off yourself in a year when you're starving and Bitcoin is the only form of money that still works.

This year is NOTHING in comparison and anyone who makes the comparison is ignorant.  Last time the fall was deeper, and it took two years to turn the corner.  This time, we turned the corner after six months.  The low was on June 29 and we haven't gone anywhere near it.  The next bull run is likely just a few months away.  We've been in kind of a bull walk since June 29.

Wrong.  The government does not create dollars. The Federal Reserve does. The government "creates" dollars when it borrows money from the Fed.  The American taxpayer pays $80-90 million per hour in interest to the families that own the Fed.  It's a big scam.

Brace yourself for a financial collapse during which you won't be able to get your Monopoly money out of the bank.  Bitcoin will still work.  It will be like what happened in 2013 when Greece and Cyprus took us to $1000, but on a much bigger scale.

You've been wrong since 2015.  You want to know what a scam is? It's where you keep your money now which is nothing but a gigantic Ponzi scheme made out of thin air.  At least Bitcoin is backed by cryptographic integrity.

@_date: 2018-11-27 12:28:09
It will be a lot like 2008 in the way it unfolds.  Somebody will get called on a derivative and not be able to pay, like Lehman, then a domino effect will occur that reveals the rot throughout the system.

In the short term, price should not matter.  Invest only what you can afford to lose and be willing to hold it for a couple years.  You'll be fine.
Same thing for merchants. "Cash out" what you need to keep your business running and hold the rest.  Price won't matter to you in a year when it's "crashing" from $50K to $15K.
These derivatives guys are on a roll right now, but they'll get caught with their pants down at some point, and there will be a huge run.  It's a lot easier to say, "You know, you need to deliver that Bitcoin you owe me" than it is to say, "You know, I need for you to deliver that gold you owe me."  This won't work as it does with other commodities.  Nobody actually wants to deal with the underlying.  With Bitcoin, somebody will decide that they do at some point, and the wheels come off for the Paper Boys at that point.

It's true though.  The people selling are the losers.  The people buying are the winners.  It really is that simple.  There are winners and losers.
It's my hope that many of the winners are good people who will make the world a better place, but when it comes to the market, it's not a touchy-feely kumbaya thing.  It's like nature: not cruel but not moral.  If the lion kills the zebra, he wins and eats.  If the zebra gets away, the lion goes hungry.  Winners and losers in every market transaction.
In Bitcoin, buyers and hodlers win, and sellers almost always end up regretting it.

So who else can afford to lose $10 billion just because they don't like Bitcoin?  All those coins were dumped at a loss.

At some point, probably within the next five years, you won't be able to buy Bitcoin on a centralized exchange, at least not in exchange for Monopoly money.  People will be "onboarded" by earning BItcoin or trading other tokens for it, and the idea of exchanging Bitcoin for fiat will seem absurd.  It will basically be the final settlement layer for all transactions and won't even need to handle that many transactions per day, paradoxically, because the value of those transactions will be incredibly high.

I hope it goes down to 2000 before the wheels come off the banking system.  You see, a 2008-level (bigger, actually) collapse is inevitable, and Bitcoin will literally save the world at that point by allowing commerce to continue.  That's the inevitability, and it has nothing to do with price.

Don't worry about the banksters.  They can't defeat mighty Bitcoin with their toilet paper "money."
It's good for Bitcoin in the longer run.  It proves that it's the superior form of money.  It won't be long before the average person figures out that it's stupid to keep money in a bank in a world where Bitcoin exists.

You're the schmuck here. 
Bitcoin is in no way comparable to MySpace. On no level. It's not a company. It's not a fad. It's the genesis of a technology that will re-form our world more profoundly than the Internet itself did. It's also the most powerful cryptographic network the world has ever seen by far.
You're the one missing out big here. The "schmucks" buying are your future bosses.

Different ball game for the reasons you stated and others.  Trust me.  Reddit trolls will be sued, if only because some very rich Bitcoiners really want to discover and expose the idiots behind this dump.  We're going to make a shitload of money off them anyway, but throwing egg in their face after bankrupting them will be icing on the cake.

I look at it as a 36-month CD that returns thousands of percent.  36 months from December 2017 (December 2020), you will have made a very large return on what you bought at $17K in 2017.  I didn't buy then, but I did buy 36 months before that, near an "all-time high."  I bought all the way down to $200.  I'm buying now, and I am willing to wait another 36 months, especially since I'm playing with house money at this point.
It's not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's a get-rich-slowly-and-patiently-because-you-understand-the-math scheme.  It will take me six years from when I started buying to be extremely wealthy, not just wealthy as I am now.
Good luck.

What could be better than a year of deeply discounted Bitcoin?
In 2020, people will look with great nostalgia on 2018, like, "Remember when you could buy Bitcoin for fake-ass dollars?"
Seriously, 2018 has been an epic year for Bitcoin. Adoption is way up.  Prices are way down.  If you had to sell, yeah, it sucked.  But if you were buying, you kicked serious ass.
I'm hoping the "bear market" continues for a while, personally.  $3000 looks pretty good to me, having been in this game for a few years.  $2000 would look even better.
Come on, Rothschild dumpers! Give us more discounts in 2019 before the next halving!
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:36:45
People are buying.  All over the world.  You'd have to be a complete idiot to not see that.
The supply has been artificially inflated via fake Bitcoin derivatives.  It's a simple formula.  You buy a bunch OTC, write a short contract worth 10x what you bought, dump what you bought at a loss.  Take your profits from the derivative.  Rinse and repeat.
It's what they do with precious metals.  It won't work with Bitcoin.  Demand is simply too steady and supply difficult to fake.  When it runs up again, it will do so in spectacular fashion, and the idiots trying to short it to zero will sustain catastrophic 11-figure losses because all that leverage is a double-edged sword.
All it will take is some lever of demand becoming greater than they expected.  Once.  And they're fucked.
Good day. Buy Bitcoin or live a life of poverty and regret. Simple as that.  It's been nothing but a big bear trap since Block 0.

No man.  Demand is fine.  Supply has been artificially inflated for the past year through fake Bitcoin derivatives. The whole scheme will come crashing down, and the people behind it will sustain catastrophic 11-figure losses.  It will be quite embarrassing for them.
They shouldn't have even tried.  This isn't the checkers they're accustomed to playing with traditional commodities like gold and silver whose prices they also suppress.
Edit -- by the way, for many of us, $3000 is not a low price.  If you had told me the price would be $3000 today two years ago, I'd have been quite pleased.  It will go much higher, so in that regard it's "low" but only a newb thinks this is a low price.
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:15:58
Supply and demand.  Supply does not really increase much, especially the float on exchanges.  Demand only grows over time.

Even then, it would be infeasible because the hash power is so high.

Those are terrible examples.  
We're talking about money, not middle school popularity contests held online.  Money is all about trust.  No other token will ever catch Bitcoin in trustworthiness.  It has 400,000x more hash power than its nearest competitor, Ethereum.
You need to educate yourself about what Bitcoin is (a revolution in financial technology that is probably even more profound and impactful than the invention of paper money) and is not (some stupid app that people use to indulge their egos).

Ironically, it's going to be the worst thing that ever happened to the criminals (banksters) because they won't be able to get away with sophisticated book cooking.  That's why they'll fight it.
It's inevitable, though.  Next time we have a 2008-level collapse (or worse), people will be much more amenable to jailing them instead of bailing them out, and getting everything into a blockchain will be a high priority to prevent these things from happening again. Financial crises are \*\*all\*\* the result of borked ledgers at the end of the day.  That's why Bitcoin was such a revolutionary invention: no more cheating.

Bitcoin won't be used for credit.  There will be other tokens whose supply grows that will be useful for lending. 
In such a world, Bitcoin will just be the ultimate settlement layer.  The value of all other tokens -- stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate -- will be measured in Bitcoin, and most large transactions will be made in Bitcoin.  It will be a store of value and a unit of account.
Everything will be tokenized, though.  This is inevitable. The next financial collapse will be, like the last one, due at root to ledgers being out of whack.  Tokenizing everything and putting it in secure blockchains will be Job One after the collapse.  Blockchain technology will make banker shenanigans leading to collapse much more difficult if not impossible.

I also send Bitcoin as a gift to a friend in a remote village in Africa.  It has been quite good for that village.  There are no banks around there.
Bitcoin will be the best thing ever for the third world... but you're right that it's not fair that Global North people once again have an unfair advantage.

1) the traditional world of Finance is about to experience a collapse. Bitcoin will be very useful when bank money is hard to get
2) demand has barely begun to be tapped. Most people still think it's some kind of shady Ponzi scheme. Demand can only grow over time, and it can grow a lot.
3) supply will tighten over time. The next halvening is barely over a year away 
4) it's easier to use Bitcoin than it is to use traditional payment methods. People will naturally adopt.

Bitcoin won't be useful for lending due to its fixed supply.  For interest to work, money supply has to inflate.
So if I lend you a cow, and you agree to pay me back a cow and a calf, you need to breed the cow in order to pay back your loan.  Without more cows coming into the system, interest is a non-starter.
Other cryptos might be useful for lending.  Bitcoin will be the world's savings account and the base settlement layer of all financial transactions.

Not if you have over $150,000 or whatever the FDIC limit is.  Brokerage accounts are not insured.  You can lose all that.  It's an IOU from known con artists and criminals.  In that case, Bitcoin is much more secure.

@_date: 2019-01-25 02:24:36
Yeah sure.  Price predictions are silly.  If you buy Bitcoin and hold it for 36 months, the only reason you'll care about price is if it goes down, you'll start buying again.  That's literally the formula: if you hold for 36 months from any point, you'll be so far up that falling prices just look like opportunities.
Over time, nobody ever regrets buying Bitcoin, but they sure do regret selling it, even at a big "profit."  Once the lightbulb goes on and you see it for what it is (the best form of money ever invented), you don't really think in terms of dollars.  You think in terms of getting as much Bitcoin as you can while you can.
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:52:18
I most definitely would hold because at that point it would be very easy to spend Bitcoin as everyone would want it.  Why would I want dollars in that scenario? So I can travel to another country and pay an exchange fee?  So my bank can pimp out my intimate financial data?  So I can hold something that is guaranteed to depreciate in value instead of the thing that made me rich?

Well, I love spending Bitcoin that I've hodled.  You buy something worth $1000 for Bitcoin that you only paid $50 for a few years ago.  It's good. It's like spreading the wealth.
And what is wrong with saving money?  Are you saying everyone should spend all their money?  They should if it is guaranteed to lose value, like the dollar, but that's not sound money.  Bitcoin is real money. Monopoly money is bullshit.  This will become exceedingly clear fairly soon.

This is fucking stupid. "Bag holder?" Fiat zombies are holding bags of depreciating crap. Bitcoin hodlers are holding their big nut sacks saying, "I got your bags right here." 
None of the biggest wallets have been selling. I don't know a single old timer who is "unloading their bags." The money that has been buying this year, especially since June, is anything but dumb. The dumb money is holding bags of stocks and bonds.

It's all working out exactly according to plan.  See genesis block. The whole thing has been a big, fat bear trap since block 0.
@_date: 2019-01-28 20:36:17
Yes, you're missing a lot.
Derivatives like CME and BitMex allow someone to dump the price of a commodity (and Bitcoin is more like a commodity than a stock), selling it at a loss without losing money.  It works like this:
Skippy Bankster wants to dump the price of Bitcoin so he goes out to the OTC market and buys $200 million worth of BTC.  Let's say if he dumps it all, the price will go down $300.  Why in Heaven's name would he do that!?!
Because before he dumps it, he takes out derivatives contracts -- maybe even with 10x leverage -- betting on the price going down.  Presto! He can sell $200 million in BTC at a big loss and not lose (much) money.  
Derivatives markets also influence the spot price because so much money (BitMex volume) is changing hands in those markets.  Look at CME futures settlement prices.  Without even looking, I am willing to bet there's not a single month where the expected settlement is higher than the previous month.  Why would that be?
Here's the good news:  It won't work.  All it will take is ONE cycle where the demand in the spot market is higher than anticipated, and they will get rekt on both ends, both on their dump in the spot market and on the leveraged derivatives.  I don't know when this will happen, but it will.  The losses will be MASSIVE for Skippy Bankster.
Hope that helped.

False dichotomy.  It's not your dream police state where undesirables get sent to "federal entertainment centers" against their will vs. Mad Max.  
North Korea has the most "fully functional" state on the planet.  Most of their people live in dire poverty, and breathing a critical word about the government will get you sent to "camp" for life or worse.
There are villages in Mexico ([here's one]( but there are others) that have kicked out the cartels *and* the *federales* and seen their murder rates plummet to zero from astronomical levels in very short periods of time.
Shitty as they are, the Taliban totally eliminated warlordism (and opium production) in Afghanistan without ever establishing what you would consider to be a "functional state."  
We could make the federal government a lot leaner, eliminate the income tax and the federal debt, and everyone would live with more freedom and prosperity.  Getting out from under the boot of the slave drivers (bankers) is a big part of this project, especially if we want to get it done peacefully.  Bitcoin is all about eliminating the need for banks.  See genesis block.

Probably so but I would **love** to know what Russian intelligence knows about the unnatural dumping and price suppression of Bitcoin for the past year.  My guess: It's Western banksters who are scared because they know the shell game is almost over.  They're about to go belly up, worse than 2008.

You would have made millions of percent if you'd put money in BTC ten years ago.  "Hard to transact with." Wrong. It's much easier than a credit card, even easier than cash.  Illiquid? Nope.  You can sell/spend it anywhere in the world. "Doesn't throw cash" -- all those forks were pretty sweet.  Also, by the way, BRK never paid a dividend, despite holding many dividend-paying companies.
I'd lay even odds that not only will Bitcoin outperform BRK by as wide a margin in the next ten years as it did in the last ten years, BRK will go bankrupt within the next five years.  Yes.  BRK will go bankrupt.  Warren Buffet is a con man at the top of a gigantic Ponzi scheme.  Mark my words.
You're completely ignorant about Bitcoin and largely ignorant about BRK.  There's a reason that ignorance results in poverty, and you're about to find that out in a visceral way if you think the current system is not going to crash extremely hard, leaving Bitcoin as one of the only forms of money that still works.  Yeah, banks are going down.  Your credit cards won't work.  Your brokerage account is a mirage.  You're poor, buddy.  You have no money. You just don't know it yet.

Doubtful.  They say they hold that much gold, but all you need to do is look at the gold market over the past ten years.  It is plain as day that MUCH more (like a factor of 200) has been sold than exists in all the vaults of the world.  Very similar to what they're doing to Bitcoin now.  It won't work with Bitcoin because it's too easy to look in the vault or demand physical delivery.

I think that a lot of no-coiners will commit suicide under the crushing regret they will feel at having been able to avoid the poverty that has befallen them, especially those like you who knew enough about Bitcoin and actively poo-pooed it instead of getting .1 BTC just in case you're wrong (spoiler: you are).


Patronizing yet passive-aggressive.  You're a real pro.  You're also wrong.  Transactions are higher than ever.  More and more people leave the ranks of no-coiner every day all over the planet.


It's going to be a financial collapse.  Think Cyprus and Greece on a much larger scale. You won't be able to get money out of your bank.  Your credit cards won't work, but Bitcoin will.
I feel sorry for you.  It will be especially hard for you.  I recommend you get a little BTC just in case you're wrong (you are) or the regret might literally kill you.

Sure, they may not be able to describe a Merkle root, but they understand that secure peer-to-peer cash in limited supply is better than Monopoly money.
Once they actually use it to buy something, they usually understand it even better.  They understand that it will replace old fashioned Monopoly money.

Transactions need to settle on-chain eventually.  They'll just be batched, and the fees will be higher.  So you settle a million LN transactions for $5 each in one shot, earning a nice fee.
Not sure what you're saying about supply, but 900 fewer freshly minted coins hitting the market every single day will be pretty substantial, especially by then as more of the existing supply will have been bought up and either put in circulation (ie, not on exchanges but being used for purchases) or cold storage.
The price could well hit a million in 2020 or 2021.

Not really.  Bitcoin is the best. Ask anybody who has actually invested in it.
And what the guy is saying is exactly true.  Every day Bitcoin is alive is a good day.  The value can only go up over time.  The low price is just an opportunity to trade more dinosaur fiat crap money for real money.  
Most people don't see this.  That's why most people aren't rich.  Within a year or so most people will be very poor because their traditional investments are going in the toilet.

Keeping your BTC on an exchange makes it very easy for the exchange to artificially inflate the supply.
Some exchange will get caught with its pants down, having sold more than it actually had, and its customers will be left out in the cold, stuck in court for years trying to get their coins.  It will be Gox 2.0.
With centralized power (such as that held by centralized exchanges), corruption is bound to happen due to greed.  Eventually, it will all be peer-to-peer exchanges for this reason.  There is no need for a middleman, including in trading.  For now, just make sure to get your coins off exchanges because one or more of them will get caught needing supply that is unavailable.

Man, I know so many people like you: well educated/indoctrinated, comfortable, and utterly clueless of the world outside their own little bubble. 
You should really get more Bitcoin before your bank goes under.  In the next financial crisis -- which is coming soon -- Bitcoin will literally save the world by allowing commerce to continue despite the failure of "western hegemony" and its insolvent banking paradigm.
"Western hegemony" led us into the trillion-dollar bloodbath in Iraq.  It caused all the troubles in every region of the world over the past 50 years.  Do Americans benefit?  I suppose they do materially... in the short term.
But really, you should stop seeing Putin behind every dark corner or you will end up babbling to yourself in a rubber room.  People have valid opinions which differ from yours, and Putin has nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:40:17

You should move it to a wallet under your control. Even a hot wallet (connected to the Internet by phone or PC) is better than keeping it on an exchange, but you should put it in a cold wallet (not connected to the Internet, like a paper wallet or Ledger or Trezor) if you really want to be safe.

Warren Buffet will go down in history as a bigger, more famous version of Bernie Madoff.  He's a complete fraud. He made one good stock call in his whole career (IBM) and got lucky with the timing of another (Coca Cola), but he has under-performed the S&amp;P for almost every year and over time.  Berkshire Hathaway was a great investment if you got in early,  but the later you got in, the more you'll lose.  It's a Ponzi scheme.

We're on the precipice of a new world filled with mathematically guaranteed prosperity.  Bitcoin will be the world's un-smashable piggy bank.  Many other tokens will exist: real estate deeds, stock certificates, music and video coins, privacy coins like Dash and Monero, nearly-as-secure-but-cheaper-and-faster Bitcoin bros like Litecoin, oldies but goodies like Doge and a few others. Everything important will be in a blockchain.  All blockchains will settle in Bitcoin.  Why?  Math and stuff.
Warren Buffet led his flock over the cliff as humanity stood on the precipice of a glorious tomorrow in which ownership is known, valid, and indisputable.  Warren Buffet sold tickets to a smoke and mirrors show and got rich and famous doing so while Satoshi Nakamoto invented real money.

What happened to this guy is unconscionable, but it can happen to anyone and everyone; just ask anyone in Greece or Cyprus over the age of 30. If your money is in a bank, you don't have any money.  What you have is an IOU that the bank can renege on at any time and for a variety of reasons.

Yeah, that's my worry too.  When the ATM and credit card networks go down, the value (and price) of Bitcoin will increase.  I'm just hoping there are enough people holding coins in non-exchange wallets when it happens so that commerce can just continue somewhat normally.
If not, there will be hunger and riots .
@_date: 2019-01-10 13:52:00

Buddy, you're not certain that you will live until tomorrow.
People who live their lives based on what the herd thinks are... the herd.  They are NPCs. They don't matter as much as they would if only they would wake the fuck up before it's too late.  The bag holders are the ones who think their 401(k) and Social Security will keep them out of poverty if only they keep their heads down and do what they're told for the next 40 years of drudgery.  
Funny thing is, the bigger bag holders end up with their heads on pikes when the Ponzi scheme goes up in flames.  Money is a trap.  Its only real value, the only thing it can *really* buy is freedom.  People with lots of money are the most worried about money of all.  They've merely painted the bars of their cells gold with all that luxury and indulgence.   They're holding the biggest bags of all.

Monopoly bank money will not survive another recession.  The entire system will grind to a halt as settlement becomes an issue.  This will happen in the next six months.  Bitcoin will become quite valuable when people can't use their credit cards and ATM cards.
Their "money" won't do them any good when the torches and pitchforks come out. 
It's going to be bad man. Please get yourself a little Bitcoin just in case I'm right.

This is a very important post. It is apparent from the tremendous volume of this dump that the dumpers are *selling Bitcoin that they do not have*. If you are buying, send your coins off exchange immediately because **there will be another Gox** when this game of musical chairs is over and somebody can't cover a ton of BTC that they borrowed. Don't get Goxxed. Take the discount and secure your property.

There's no risk.  Volatility, yes.  Risk, no.
Bitcoin is a finite, tangible resource.  Debt is an infinite, intangible thing.  We can say how much Bitcoin exists, but nobody can tell you how much debt exists.  
In a negative-interest world, Bitcoin is the least risky thing you can hold.  You should get as much of it as you can and forget about it for a year.  Your "risk tolerance" will be much higher when you check back in.

Nobody knows, but my best guess is that the price dumpers are paying off their altcoin loans before they pay off their Bitcoin loans and hoping to make a profit on the altcoin FOMO before paying back the Bitcoin they owe.

@_date: 2019-09-26 19:16:36
Wrong.  "They" are the bankers.  The amount of Bitcoin dumped in the past 48 hours was more than the total of a month of all mining.  You are the one who doesn't understand what is going on.  Let me tell you how "they" do it:
Why do you think the CME wanted to double (did double?) the limit on their contracts?  Because they need more fake paper to keep the price in check.  
What "they" do is dump billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin on the spot market at a huge loss and make up those losses by shorting their paper contracts.  It didn't work last year (in the long run) and it darn sure won't work this year with the banking system teetering (or maybe you think the Fed injecting a half trillion in liquidity in one week signals a strong, solvent banking system).
By the way, please stop calling people ignorant when your ignorance is glaring and obvious.  It's not miners.  Miners always sell.  The volume of this dump would have to have entailed all miners in the world saving up their coins for six weeks, then dumping them all within a few15-minute periods.  Preposterous.
@_date: 2019-09-10 12:04:23

It's a futures contract that will settle in Bitcoin.  Other Bitcoin futures settle in dollars (i.e., they don't need to have any Bitcoin to bet against it).  
The theory is that Bakkt will drive demand.  I think it will serve mainly as an instrument to drive the price down.  It might work in the short term, but eventually the shorts will face the same problem they always do: they need supply to sell.

@_date: 2019-09-18 12:17:34
Correct.  The interbank lending system is the problem here.  The drastic spike in the overnight rate (to 10%) is the result of a breakdown of trust.  Somebody owes money, and somebody else doesn't trust them to pay it back.  
There is a BIG bank getting ready to fail.
@_date: 2019-09-18 19:21:12
This is just like March -- low volume after the dumpers run out of coins, nice comfy level having been attained.  In March the comfy level was $4K.  Now it's $10K.

True.  You should put it all in Bitcoin or at least 90 percent.
@_date: 2019-09-18 12:02:28


Well, at least you're asking the right question.
The short answer is that there is a breakdown of trust in the inter-bank lending apparatus.  Somebody is insolvent, and they're trying to stave off the inevitable bank failure (which would be a cascading event as other banks are on the other end of whatever the insolvent bank owes and wouldn't get paid in the event of a failure).
Get your money out of banks, folks.  In the best case scenario the dollar loses a lot of value (inflation).  In the worst case scenario, the system seizes up and you can't access your money or use your credit cards.

By the way, that spike was just Act I.  Wait until those coins get sent off the exchanges, and the exchanges have to scramble and scrape to get back all their customers' coins which they lent away to the shorters.  That will be a laugh.

Prior to the current situation of purely fiat currency, currencies were actually backed by something, usually gold.  If you didn't have the gold, you couldn't print the notes.

There is room for both kinds of money.  When Bitcoin becomes the globally standard measure of wealth in a few years, nobody will want to flaunt the fact that they're hodling.  Governments and their central banks will probably introduce their own "cryptos" which will be useful for everyday spending.  Bitcoin will be where you put your savings, but it won't be what you spend in most cases.

Here's some advice for beginners:
Don't trade.  Just don't do it. It's not worth it because you'll be measuring gains in 10s of percent and will most likely not have enough gains to offset your losses.  Plus, it complicates your tax picture.  Not worth it.
Just buy, send to your own wallet, and forget about it for a couple years.  After you have mad gainz, you can play around with a small amount of BTC, and you will understand the market better than you would as a beginner.
Edit to add:  This game looks like fun, but don't put real money on the line until you know what you're doing and are playing with house money.

They're obviously doing it because they're in trouble.
The way it's supposed to work:
You deposit your money in a bank.  They lend your money out at 8% interest and pay you 4% interest, pocketing the difference.
The way it works now:
You deposit your money.  They lend it out at interest *and* steal your money.
This is a sneaky bail-in.  They're taking people's money.  If they weren't in trouble, they wouldn't need to do this.

Spot price can easily be manipulated down by borrowing a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin and dumping it on the market.  Even if you do that at a loss, if you write a few billion in bullshit paper contracts, you make up your loss.
Don't you get it?  That's what they do.  Dump on the spot market at a loss and make up their losses on paper contracts.
Trouble for them is that they're going to have to pay back all the Bitcoin they've borrowed and dumped since June, just like they had to buy back all the Bitcoin they borrowed and dumped last year.  That's what happened from $4K-$13K, by the way: dumbass banksters covered their shorts.

Do not keep your BTC on an exchange.  The exchange will lend it to short sellers.  If you want the price to go up, remove your coins from the float.  Additionally, some of these exchanges are going to get Goxed because they're all lending more than they should.  Don't get Goxed.  Claim your coins.

The problem with this idea is that the bearwhales would dump right after that green candle.  Best to keep them guessing.
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:06:59
The volume of this dump combined with the smallness of the drop in price proves we're still in a bull market.  In a few weeks, all the BTC that have been dumped since June will start to be repaid.
Zoom out.  We were at $4K five months ago.  Five months from now we'll be well north of $20K.

You're right in the short term, but the need for "physical" BTC will eventually (within a month or two) mean that demand and price will increase.  The thing to watch with Bakkt is volume.  If the volume is high, eventually the price will rise even if the contracts are being used primarily to short.

Someone doesn't understand the definition of money laundering.  The guy was probably hoping to do a like-kind exchange to avoid taxes which is totally legal in theory.

I think it depends largely on traditional markets.  If things look dicey, smart money will move out.  Bitcoin is the safest way to do that.  Even gold is risky because who wants to deal with it physically?  Trusting a bank to hold your gold is pointless in a SHTF scenario.
Some whales only want to drive the price down.  They don't care how much fiat they lose doing it.  Some whales want to move the price up but not at their own expense.  It's an interesting market for sure.  Will depend on when demand really ramps up.

FTFY. It's tracking 2016 very well right now.  In 2016 we had a big run up in June, a dive, a flat period, then a run up in November or so.  This year the run up will be more dramatic since the volume on the late June dump was so high, and most of it was borrowed.

Actually, no, that's bad advice unless it's credit card debt.
If you can service the debt comfortably, it's cheap money.  Don't trade Bitcoin for cheap money.  Take out more debt and buy Bitcoin.  That's the smart thing to do.  The debt will cost you 5% or whatever, but the Bitcoin will yield thousands of percent over the next few years.

Blockchain will make government much more transparent, but in this case, I have to say that it's unlikely to be Bitcoin.  There will probably be some kind of government fiat running on a public blockchain which will be worlds better than what we have now.  Bankers lending false, untraceable, unbacked money to the government in endless amounts with you and I on the hook for this accounting nightmare is not going to fly much longer.

It's a joke because that's how money laundering is done -- start a cash business and pump up the sales.
So you have $100,000 in drug money to clean.  You start a food truck and say you sold $15,000 per day when you actually only sold $3000 per day.  After a couple weeks you have nice clean drug money.
Bitcoin is actually a terrible way to launder money.

For at least nine years thousands of new "better than Bitcoin" shitcoins have crashed and burned.  
I hold a little LTC because it's a good coin for spending and because its community doesn't disrespect Bitcoin and because it's been around for ten years.  It's also pretty well decentralized.  Any coin that disrepects Bitcoin can fark off.  Ethereum has 1/400,000 the hash power of Bitcoin and has already had to reset its chain twice in its short history.  The rest of them are subject to attack by anyone because they're centralized and weak.

It's more than that.  They both know what a couple of frauds they are.  They've been running a huge Ponzi scheme for half a century.  BRK doesn't even pay a dividend and never has.  It goes up because new suckers keep buying it and banksters keep lending money to the companies it owns.  
When the dust settles after the next collapse, these guys are going to look worse than Bernie Madoff.  They're not stupid.  They know this.

It's not odd at all if your business is "controlling the narrative," but it doesn't make much sense at all if your business is just a business.  
I'm pretty much as liberal as they come, and I'm more or less disgusted with the censorship of our rivals.  If our arguments are the right ones, they should stand up to criticism and even be made stronger when forged in the hot fire of debate.  It  absolutely disgusts me to see people on "my side" making patently fascist arguments.  No, it's not OK to discriminate against people with whom you disagree in a "private company" any more than it was OK for the USSR to economically marginalize dissenters and send them off to gulags or any more than it was OK for the Nazis to steal everything people had and send them off to camps.

of course once i sell it to you, you can sell it again. duh.
but the old tricks of market manipulation will not work here. that's the point that you're missing, and that's why you'll be extremely poor in a few months if you're still a no-coiner.
good day.

You guys are great at strawmen.  Bitcoin has done just fine and dandy without banks and ETFs and derivatives and all that bullshit.  It will do fine with or without them.  Personally, I hope they're the ones shorting it now.  I don't want those assholes to have any real money when their fake money Ponzi scheme collapses in the next few months.

On Bitmex you can actually see the liquidations, but elsewhere you might not know.
A lot of the coins that were borrowed for the big November dump haven't been repaid yet.  You will see big buys to cover that, but those won't show up as liquidations.

Well, that would be very good for Bitcoin, wouldn't it? Seems like removing BFX's float and the 30,000 or so coins shorted there would create quite a supply squeeze. 
Of course, BFX backing tether 100% with BTC could also instill quite a bit of faith in tether as it would be a considerably better reserve than your average bank's holding of only 3-5% of the money they've printed through loans. 
It's kind of a "Heads I win, tails, you lose" for Bitcoin.

OK then.  Stick around.  Make fun of us.  I remember when people like you were making fun of us in 2014 back on BitcoinTalk forums.  How do you think they felt when they saw Bitcoin go from $200 to $3000 over the next three years?

Actually, borrowing money to buy Bitcoin is a great investment.   $10,000 in Bitcoin today will be worth $50,000 at some point in the not-too-distant future.  If you're only paying 5-6% on the loan, it's a good deal.

Not true. Some (a lot of people on this sub) will have more.  It is absolutely not guaranteed that the velocity of money would slow.  This is pure dogma, albeit backed by "economic theory."
I predict that *real* economic activity will increase dramatically a few years after the difficult (for most) transition period as people scramble after Bitcoin.  
The problem with bankster money is inflation.  For the most part, new money (loans) doesn't create any economic activity as it is rational for banksters to lend to (for example) home buyers because such a loan comes with collateral.  They are not going to lend to new businesses because those loans are riskier.
The net effect is that housing prices go up.  University costs go up (because student loans are also risk-free for banksters).  Stock prices go up (because corporate bonds are essentially risk-free as they get offloaded to derivatives).  Is any real economic activity generated?  No.  
If banks directed their money to new economic activity, the bankster apologists would have a point, but they do not as a general rule.  Loans to new enterprises (or even existing enterprises building out capital instead of doing share buybacks) are risky for banks.  
In the Bitcoin world, people who have Bitcoin will be funding all kinds of cool projects in their communities and on a global scale.  No debt slavery will occur as a result of this economic activity, and the wealth will be spread to those who do the work.  It's going to be super cool!

Edit:  .017% of outstanding AAPL shares = 850,000 shares.  If somebody dumped that many shares over the course of an hour or two, it would cause a bloodbath.

Yes, as value goes up, fees as measured in dollars will go up.  That's why LN is so brilliant.  It allows miners to continue mining profitably, users to continue to transact cheaply, and hodlers to make a few satoshis from their hodlings ==&gt; win, win, win.

Exactly.  What's not rational is trying to trade Bitcoin to get dollars.  Most will lose at that game.

Spotted the person who has never used Bitcoin. It's a lot easier than any other type of transaction and a lot cheaper and faster for larger transactions. 
It's like the early days of email when it was hard getting people to use it because they weren't familiar with the process and already had fax machines which gave them a "hard copy." lol Bitcoin will replace fiat and intrusive, expensive banking processes just as surely as email replaced the fax machine.

Coinbase most definitely is having such issues in my opinion.  You used to be able to fat finger a market buy and send it to the mothership immediately.  During the 2017 bull run they started making you wait a few days.  Now it's like two weeks.  I can't think of any other reason for doing this except that maybe they don't have the BTC on hand.
Also, they're lending BTC and paying "institutional" investors interest for keeping it on exchange so they can do that.  You have to be stupid to lend BTC since the only thing it will be used for is shorting, and if the price goes up and your lendee can't repay, oh well, they go bankrupt and you lose all that BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:38:05
Bitcoin is the only asset that is almost completely decoupled from the madness of the traditional financial markets.  If $20-30 billion flows out of stocks and bonds and into Bitcoin, the price will quickly exceed the ATH.  
$20-30 billion is chicken feed in the traditional markets.  This news will definitely impact stocks and bonds in a big way.  Some companies might do OK, but others will see a mass exodus of market capitalization.

If you buy now and it goes down, keep buying until it goes back up. It will definitely go back up, and when it does, it will go up far and fast.  You won't want to miss it.  These periods when shorts try to kill Bitcoin are actually my favorite market conditions because I can get more for less.

Agree, but it's not "government currency." It is brought into existence by private banks when they make loans.  That's part of the problem.
Life was actually much better for the average person when the government was in charge of currency.  It's one of the smartest parts of the US Constitution.  Those guys knew that handing control of the money over to private bankers was game over for "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
The government doesn't need to borrow a dime if Congress ends the Fed and assumes its Constitutional responsibility.  Congress makes a budget and prints that much money; that's how it's supposed to work.
At this point the government is so hopelessly corrupt that it might be a lost cause so, yes, sidestep it whenever possible.  Earn as little money as possible.

Literally nobody shorted at 20K because nobody bought there.  The price was there for all of 2 minutes.
But a lot of people did short Bitcoin throughout the year.  Some of them have to pay back the mass amounts of Bitcoin they borrowed to do this.  That's how shorting works: You borrow and buy back at a lower price.  
They won't be buying back at a lower price because the minute they start covering all those BTC, the price will blow past $20k BY A MILE.

You must be new here.  Yes.
Stocks are headed for a long-term bear market because the Fed won't be able to print enough fake money this time like they did last time.  Stocks are going to crash 80 percent.  The difference is, they won't bounce back. You'll see big old companies go bankrupt, including many banks.  Look at GE.  Look what happened to GM bond holders in 2008 (went to zero, lost everything).  You're insane if you think that Ponzi scheme will keep going forever, and that's what it was -- companies borrowing money, buying back their own shares to artificially inflate the prices, executives cashing out leaving empty husks of companies.  It was a huge con game.  If you're smart, you'll buy a little Bitcoin just in case I'm right.

Your timeline is very conservative.  By 2023 EVERYONE will want Bitcoin.  Maybe only 20 percent of people will have it, and that will be a problem.
The main thing that makes it inevitable is that the banks are going to collapse.  They've been using borrowed money to buy stocks and bonds for ten years.  When the stock market falls to a certain point, you'll see banks going tits-up left and right.  At that point, bank cards will not work.  If you don't have cash money or crypto, you'll be farked.

Well said!  Required filing of tax returns violates the Fourth Amendment (people have the right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure) and Fifth Amendment (right to not self-incriminate -- the smallest mistake can get someone in big trouble).  What right does the government have to audit individual citizens?  ZERO!  
We should all stop paying our taxes until we get accountability about where those monies go, including the $500 billion in interest we pay to the owners of the Federal Reserve; we have a right to know who those people are and why our government borrows money from them instead of just printing its own.

.0004 would represent a .04% transaction cost, far lower than a bank would charge.
No, it wouldn't make BCash more popular.  BCash's hash rate is miniscule compared to Bitcoin and is controlled by a couple people.  You get what you pay for.
For smaller transactions, Lightning Network is fine.  For larger transactions, it's worth paying for the extra security.

That's the funny thing about gold bugs.  They're semi-awake about how rigged and awful the traditional financial markets are, but they don't see that their gold is an easy mark for the banksters while Bitcoin is not.  Gold can't be verified like Bitcoin can, and contracts in gold are almost never settled in physical gold.  Bitcoin will eventually destroy the derivatives traders trying to keep it down and end up being the thing that frees gold prices to rise to their natural (much higher) level.  Think they'll thank us?

I think it will lose 100% of its purchasing power in the next ten years.  The Federal Reserve dollar is going away, to be replaced with some sort of Congressionally supply constrained crypto dollar if all goes as planned.  You'll spend government crypto and save Bitcoin is how I see it playing out.

There are a lot of "institutions" out there including companies that do large amounts of business across borders, pension funds, hedge funds, and even state-level actors diversifying their foreign reserves holdings.
The supply of BTC is tiny -- it is rare stuff.  A few billion dollars worth of long-term investment can simultaneously move the price up dramatically and reduce the supply.  The next leg up will be explosive.  What we have seen over the past couple months is just a teaser of a teaser.

The 2FA is the most concerning part for me. They would have to have stolen the auth tokens from a lot of different people. It's not trivial to hack that, not like hacking a password.  If they cracked 2FA then all of us would have much bigger problems that extend to any account where we use it.  
But I don't believe it.  It doesn't add up.  It's more likely that an insider sold it or that their internal accounting was off somehow.  "Hacked" has been the easiest way to explain a BTC shortfall since Gox.  Not buying it.

Good stuff.  Data set isn't big enough to calculate a reliable mean, though.  I think the shape of the bottom is more significant.  This current one has a pretty dramatic bow.  I think we go up to $10K pretty fast from here, retrace dramatically (back to $6K or so), then shoot up to an ATH within 100 days of the spike at $10K.

I'm not OP, but I'll take these.


No.  It's dead-on.


Some of us have put most of our portfolios into BTC and done quite well as a result.  The "rest of my portfolio" consists of a few shares of stock that I'm just letting ride because I like the companies and have already cashed out my initial investment to Bitcoin.  When the inevitable collapse occurs, bitcoiners will be feeling very rich, and there will be great deals because of the reasons OP described (a deflationary environment in which businesses are desperate to unload inventory).


Because it will still work when your credit cards and ATM cards stop working and because it's the only instrument that is almost entirely decoupled from the epidemic fraud in the traditional markets (yes, you read that correctly).  Of course the people trading "Bitcoin" on E*TRADE and Fidelity will be screwed, but cold hodlers will be sitting pretty.

Some exchanges are basically fraudulent.  Most of the "trades" are just the exchange buying and selling to itself.  They do this for various reasons.

Precisely why the only reason I care about the price of Bitcoin is that when it goes down, I can get more.  
It's about the value, not the price.  The value is (partially) in having real, verified money instead of an IOU and being able to send it to anyone, anywhere, any time without having to ask permission from a third party.

It wasn't the longest.  It was almost exactly one year between the top and the bottom.  2014-2016 was much longer.  If memory serves it was 18 months between top and bottom and about two years before a new ATH was achieved.  We'll have a new ATH by October this time, I reckon.

Not really an effective ad in my opinion because it sets up an adversarial relationship between gold and Bitcoin that will cause gold bugs to dig in their heels and stick to their guns.
A better approach would have been to appeal to the areas in which the gold bugs are correct -- sound money, good hedge against debt-based madness -- and show how Bitcoin aligns with those same goals, then gently urging them to re-balance a bit, perhaps by showing how easy it is to buy something with Bitcoin.  Maybe Cheap-O Air would even be willing to partner since they already have a TV ad budget.

I can pull numbers from my posterior too!
98% of no-coiner trolls on this site will be poor for the rest of their lives.
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:43:18
By the end of the year it will be even more lopsided.  Oil will go up a lot.  Bitcoin will go up a lot more than that.  S&amp;P will fall by 30-60%.  Bonds will fall though their yields might increase.  Copper is falling off a cliff in recent weeks (which is a BIG economic indicator).  Hogs... poor little piggies.
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:50:02
Because the only people selling Bitcoin are the ones selling it for a loss to drive the price down. 
If I ever (God forbid) need to sell Bitcoin, I will do it on Bisq.

I know that feeling.  It gets better after hodling for a while and even better when you spend.

"No future" lol. I wonder how those old trolls on BitcoinTalk feel now? Probably pretty rotten. Some of them are probably still trolling and not hodling. Hard to feel sorry for them, though.

I'm holding a bag full of rare and precious cryptographically verified Bitcoin.  Do you even have a bag? If so, what's in it? Stocks? Bonds? Bankrupt US dollars that nobody will even want in three years?  Fuck off, my future employee (if you're lucky).
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:01:51
Hmmm... I've had the opposite experience.  It's easy to just keep buying when it goes down but really hard not to take profits when it goes up a lot.  It's way worse to sell thinking you'll buy back cheaper then watch it double in a few weeks than it is to see the price falling, buy the dips and hold.

@_date: 2018-12-17 14:37:26
No, definitely.  It's simple math.  
Not only will it definitely go up, but it will definitely go up to 10 or 20x the ATH, then "crash," then repeat.

I bought my first at $800 and bought it all the way down to $200.  Took three years before I saw my big profit.
You'll be fine if you hodl, but you should average down.  $8K will look super cheap by 2020.

I don't know about CB, but I promise you that some exchanges do not have all the Bitcoin they've sold in this recent dump.  Simple math tells you that more was sold than exists on exchanges.
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:02:05
Targets for what?  Selling?
Here are my targets:
I will sell one percent of my stack at $20K.
I will sell one percent of my stack at $100K.
I will sell 10 percent of my stack at $300K (only because I think it will fall from there and I want to buy back in)
The rest of my stack will be spent, not sold, because by then "Bitcoin" will be synonymous with "money."
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:00:58
No.  Sorry for being so curt.
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:49:09

Ten years is not very long.  It took e-mail almost 20 years to become mainstream.  Same with mobile phones, automobiles, computers and pretty much every other technological advance.
It won't take Bitcoin that long because the financial system will crumble in the next couple years, and Bitcoin/crypto will be the only form of money that works.

Everything will settle in Bitcoin because it will have more hashpower and more decentralized hash power than any state crypto. State cryptos will be useful for things like taxes and local spending, but Bitcoin will be the world's savings account.

Bitcoin won't be used for lending.  It's not suitable for that purpose due to its limited supply.  If I lend you a cow and you agree to pay me back two cows, that doesn't work if the cows are all sterile.  New cows have to enter the market for interest on them to work.
There will be other tokens suitable for lending.  Maybe Ethereum.  If you buy a house with Bitcoin it will be mortgage-free.

Yeah, it's something like that.  ETH hash power is measured in TeraHash.  BTC is over 100,000 Peta now.
The parabolic fractal will probably repeat a couple more times, then it will just be synonymous with money and the price of everything will be measured in Bitcoin.  Anybody not buying now will regret it in a few years, that's for sure.

Criminals are a lot like business people.  They look for the highest return on investment.
So step one is discretion.  Don't let anyone know that you have enough worth going to prison or dying over.
Step two is to make yourself a difficult target.  Learn self defense.  Buy a gun and learn how to use it if it's legal where you live.  Secure your living quarters with good locks, cameras, etc.  Be aware of your surroundings.  All that stuff.
If you really do have enough to make it worth kidnapping you or torturing you, do what rich people now do: hire security.

Litecoin kicks BCash's ass in every possible way.  It's faster, cheaper, more decentralized, more widely used (LTC's chain is very active) and not run by a bunch of con artists and criminals.
You're also lying about BTC transactions.  You've obviously never made one.  I have never paid over a buck or so in fees and never waited more than 20 minutes sending amounts much larger than $100.  When I send a very large amount, I do up the fee a bit and it does cost me a couple bucks, but it always gets there within 10-20 minutes.

How is it market manipulation to claim your property? If a company's stock were being shorted and the company's shareholders all called their brokers and demanded their certificates to remove their shares from the shorting pool, would this be manipulation or defense *against* manipulation? 
I hope it works, and I hope all the jerks shorting end up having to try and cover into a market in which nobody is selling, and there's nothing for sale.

Maybe you need to take another look at volatility.  Bitcoin has been very consistent in this pattern pretty much since the beginning.  It goes up thousands of percent, drops 80 percent, goes up thousands of percent, drops 80 percent and so on.  That's how we got from $.06 to $3500.  That's how we'll get from $3500 to the point where it won't even be measured in dollars anymore (call it the moon or whatever).  
It's not "volatile" if it's completely predictable.  Buy the dip, sell when you have mad gainz (measured in hundreds or thousands of percent -- but never sell all because you never know).

Most miners operate in areas where there is a big surplus of hydro-power that would otherwise be largely wasted.  
In fact, this is a theme: they use energy that would otherwise be wasted, as in the case of the natural gas burn-offs in Canada.

Optimistic? Did you mean pessimistic?
The problems are much bigger than unsustainable debt.  Remember 2008?  One financial firm went bankrupt in the blink of an eye when ONE derivatives contract went sour for them.  This created a domino effect.  This time, that institution will be a bank. The settlement systems will be screwed, and people's cards will not work.
It won't be fun, even for us Bitcoiners who will find ourselves suddenly wealthier.

Your bank pimps out your financial data to anyone who pays.  If I know everything about you, I own you.
Your bank can freeze your money, or your bank may go bankrupt.  It's not really your money.  It's theirs. They just let you use it.
The whole point is to eliminate banks or at least many of their functions such as holding our money hostage and charging us massive amounts of money to pay for things (2 percent on every credit card purchase adds up).
[EDIT TO ADD]: It's about financial sovereignty and freedom.  Bitcoin is a much more sound form of money than fiat in many, many ways -- more secure, grows in value (over time), ACTUALLY backed by cryptography and math instead of by bankster fiat (which is worth jack shit as we saw in 2008 and will see again soon), and I must say that if you do not have any BTC, you should get at least a little now just on the off chance that I'm right (I am).  You will regret not buying Bitcoin now for the rest of your life.  You've been warned.

Bail-ins are coming.  The debt crisis is already near a boiling point. It's going to go like this:  debt crisis -&gt; banking crisis -&gt; currency crisis.  Got Bitcoin?
Also, nobody lost 85% because nobody bought at $20K.  If a lot of people had bought there, the price would have stayed there.  
Which bank made you 30% on all the coins you smartly scooped up last year at $6K?  A lot more people bought at $6K than $20K.

I'm hodling forever, but I will sell small portions at certain targets.  I'll sell maybe 1 percent at $20K, 1 percent at $100K, 10 percent at $300K (with the intention of buying back in lower)... and after that adoption should be high enough that there won't be any point in selling back to fiat.  Just buy with BTC (or convert a little  BTC to LTC and buy with that).
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:18:00
What's really funny is that they make "money transactions" 100% transparent.  The thing they don't like about it is the quasi-anonymity and the fact that they don't create it out of their bank computers.

First and most importantly it frees your mind, showing you what money really is (a mutually agreed upon measure of value and nothing more) and allowing you to "think outside the box" with regard to economics and the way the world works.
Second, it frees you to take action and opt out of money that is created by a small privileged class, thereby taking away a little bit of that class' tremendous power.  Taking your money out of the bank and putting it in Bitcoin is a declaration of independence of sorts.
Third, with time and patience, increases your purchasing power tremendously and removes a lot of financial stress.

These people are beyond redemption.  Let them make their mistakes.  It's going to be hard to want to help the no-coiners when all of this unfolds because they've been so mean an nasty, but we must rise above that.
You and I know how the flow of Bitcoin goes.  It rises, it spikes, it crashes.  It rises (to the top of the last spike), it spikes (to a ridiculous price), it crashes.  It's math.  Supply for sale (float) goes down, demand only rises over time. Pretty simple stuff, really.
When some old-school whale plunks down 20,000 BTC on Bitmex and goes 5x long and wipes out all the shorts, Bitmex will go bankrupt, and Bitcoin will go to six figures in a matter of months.

Try two years.  Buy and hodl for two years. If you did that in 2014 and 2015, it's very easy to do in 2018 and 2019 and 2022 and 2023 and so on.

Yes, at some point futures will become a joke.  They are completely useless in Bitcoin, and the price manipulation won't work the same as it does with gold or pork bellies, not forever.  Nobody wants to deal with 5 tons of gold or 50,000 tons of pork bellies so they're happy to "cash settle" their futures contract.  With Bitcoin, all it will take is for ONE contract winner to say, "You know, I think I'd rather have the 25,000 BTC than cash settlement" and the jig will be up.

It's more similar to 2015 after it became clear that the bearwhale would not succeed in killing Bitcoin.
We all know what happened shortly thereafter. It will be the same this time, plus a total economic collapse in traditional markets.
Personally, I think it's funny. I'm laughing all the way as far away from the doomed bank as I can get.

No, losing your life's savings is what happens when you let the Fed stick it to you by storing "your" money in one of their insolvent scam banks.  I suspect you will find this out the hard way in the not-too-distant future, bootlicker.

They bought over 11,000 BTC in April.  I'm sure they're buying now.
The premium is due to the fact that it's the only way people can trade BTC in tax-privileged accounts.  They still have to have the BTC to back the shares.  As they issue more shares, they'll buy more BTC.

No-coiner spotted.
Bitcoin is way easier to use. You don't even have to sign up for anything.  And the "last-mile infrastructure" is better.  Not sure what good the first mover advantage is when you're talking about saving hundreds of thousands of dollars (which is what it would cost to move $250 million through a bank).

What are you talking about?  A lot of people thought it would go to 3K.  Some people thought it would go to three figures.  
The only thing that could cause it to drop back to $3K now would be Satoshi's coins moving, and even that dip wouldn't last long.

~~No, capital gains are not considered income.  They are capital gains.~~
This was actually incorrect.  So move somewhere where you can live comfortably on under $39,375 (if single) and cash out only enough to have realized $39,374 in gains.  Bonus points if that place is overseas where the first ~$100K is not taxable.  
You could live very well indeed and legally owe zero taxes to the war machine.  You just have to wait a few years.

Because they won't be able to get their money out of their banks.  It's going to be a bail-in this time, not a bailout.

(Hint: many millions)
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:20:14


Not if the dump was borrowed (shorted) like this one obviously was.  
On  Bitfinex alone there are currently around 39000 BTC sold short (borrowed and sold and needing to be bought back).    No doubt the number is much higher when you add in all the other exchanges.  
It's going to bounce quite hard, and the fact that such a massive dump resulted in such a small price movement is bullish.
