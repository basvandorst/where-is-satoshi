Tough to do.  I spec'd a machine on newegg, with 6950's and came up with ~$.91/Mh/s.  
This assumes the GPU's can be unlocked (turned into 6970s) and maintain about 390Mh/s.  But I did include a $40 HD.
Also, if you can get them to 410Mh/s (doable, but it's going to be loud and power hungry) it drops to $.87/Mh/s.
BTW:  Where are you getting these 5850's from?

Just the one 6950, unfortunately.  I don't think my PSU has anything to do with it, as it will happily power the card at +20% power and a 950Mhz core clock and make 410Mh/s (but it's fairly loud, running the fan at 70 or 80%).  Running it at 915Mhz with +8% power makes 390Mh/s (with the fan at 60%).
However, if I run the same setup with the power set at +7% it drops to 311Mh/s.

But he said it takes $2 to make 1BTC.  And 1BTC is trading at ~$22.  Why would he sell to you for $2 per 1BTC?  Just to make a point?  Offer them $1100 for 50BTC and I think you'll find some buyers.  Or hell, offer me $22 and I'll send you 1BTC.
I guess I don't quite get your point.

The 6000 series can't use the most efficient streaming (or whatever AMD calls their CUDA equivalent) SDK.  That said, the point is a bit moot, since the good 5000 series are hard to find and seem to be experiencing a bit of price gouging as a result.
On the other hand, quite a few brands of 6950 will unlock to become a 6970.  Also the 6950's are quite reasonably priced these days.  So for $250 or so, you can get a card that will do 300Mh/s (this is the worst case scenario).  With some luck (it unlocks to a 6970) and tuning they'll put out 390Mh/s easily enough and get 400+Mh/s if you don't mind the fan noise.
So 6950's (or the 6000's in general) aren't as capable as the 5000's (mostly because of the SDK compatibility, as far as I understand it).  But the 5000's that can get 300+Mh/s are becoming rarer every day.  Even the 6950's are becoming rare.  I bought a 6950 on Wednesday, and they were sold out by Friday.

There's also something to be said (if you're solo mining with one machine) that even if the market doesn't hold, you'll still have a kickass gaming machine!  So regardless of the BTC market, you'll still have "value" (though I suppose only if you're a big PC gamer).

[This]( is the card I was speaking of.

No doubt, the good mining hardware is getting scarce and expensive.  I bought an MSI 6950 (a great card that unlocks to a 6970 and makes ~390 Mh/s all day) 4 days ago (4 days!) and it's now unavailable... like anywhere.

For reals.  Seems like everyone is sold out and now even the 6950's are becoming scarce.

Obviously the banks are all powerful federally, but on a local level they're relatively weak (more so now that the downturn destroyed all the local banks and were consolidated in the NY banks).  Making a law that makes BTC illegal requires it being illegal by name.  Thus a similar currency could come around with a different name and be perfectly legal.  
Then they'd have to outlaw the idea of virtual currency.  They'd have a tough time doing it now (think EA, Microsoft, and AcctiBlizzard) it will only be tougher as time goes on.
