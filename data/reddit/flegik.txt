Yet it has to be done

Ye we know, we were there. Let us enjoy the little things in life. 
Nobody knows if this is just another bump on the road to 4k or the start of a turn around.

Wowzers. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:41:29
No.. what I wanted to say is that only because 1 BTC is worth more than 1 ounce of gold, it isn't automatically overpriced.
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:30:05
Yea but how many ounces are there?
@_date: 2018-08-19 19:18:44
CLA 45 AMG. Should be the 2016 or 17 one.

Haha der ist in die Pfalz runter gefahren. ;)

Well since all these ETFs that were denied wouldn't actually have sold and bought real BTC it's good news for the most of us because that gives manipulation less room to accur.
@_date: 2018-08-09 09:57:03
Because people sell
@_date: 2018-08-20 05:50:31
Well I was only able to tell it because I heard the sound while it was accelerating. The difference between the normal 1.6l turbo engine in the CLA 200 with 156 PS and the 2l turbo engine with 381 PS in the CLA 45 should be acknowledgeable. Without the modelplate there is not much differences elsewhere after the facelift accured.

It dumps again.

This is why they are called medium articles. Because they are neither well done nor rare.

Interest follows price and not the other way around.

Can you stream that live on twitch to spread awareness? Like these"Twitch plays Pokémon" thingy? 
Would be awesome if there was a plug in for twitch to do it via chat tho!

Hey what wallets do you guys use? I'd just like to create my wallet, write my private key on a paper etc and hold my btc for a longer timeframe. What is the best option for that? And is this site the correct one to download from? 
Appreciate any help!
Edit: I did hold other crypto before but just sold one of my alts to finally get my hands on some good old BTC but I dont wanna keep it on an exchange..

Yes you will own Satoshi about $12k per Bitcoin in a year from now.
@_date: 2018-07-06 07:25:13
There is a lot of stuff you can buy for 190$ which will give you a lot less in return tho.
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:39:48
100 times better with the right tilt. And the gif aswell.

Wait a few month and I can hook you up with this one:
@_date: 2018-07-31 05:34:46
"Today we're gonna learn how to go down on someone."
"But.. Mr. Bitcoin isn't that..."
"Oh no.. not that kind of going down.. I'll show you."
