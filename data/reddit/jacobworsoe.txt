Thanks for using ExchangeMyCoins.com.
Can you please elaborate on why you find our service "shady looking"? We are very focused on making a reliable and trustworthy service.
To show that we are a legit company, we are very honest and open about who we are. You can see our personal social profiles on the about page: 
This information is often difficult to find on other bitcoin services, so we want to be very open and honest.
Regarding the cut. We are offering the best possible rate we can give, while also running a sustainable business, which will also be here a year from now.
When setting our rate, we take several key factors into account, such as volatility of the value of bitcoin, exchange fees, transaction fees, server cost, etc. which all have to be taken into account to run a profitable and sustainable bitcoin service.
Feel free to ask any other questions you might have and I will answer them as fast as possible.
Best regards
Jacob Worsøe
