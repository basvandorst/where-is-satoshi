We wanted to volunteer &amp; develop intermediary system for accepting Bitcoin through gateway for Russian merchants, and started advertising it, at some point they blocked us as an inappropriate thing - few hours of work just been banned and deleted with 1 click. No wonder why nobody is interested in their highly censored platform. Nothing legit is allowed there and too much fake businesses.

So if I follow the logic of the analogy, the people who demand the passenger's weight to be measured before they step on to the train are the miners, correct?
In another word, for the artificial limit to be removed, it must start with miners who are willing to adopt the program.
Okay, but here's my question. What will happen when some miners adopt that program, while other miners have not? Does this mean that there would be a period when some blocks would still have that artificial limit, while not for others? 
If Alice is trying to transfer a unit of BTC smaller than a satoshi to Bob, but the miner has not adopt the new program, how is the miner able to do proof of work for something that his/her program is not made to verify?
From the perspective of non-newbie hobbyist, I do think there is a better way to explain this, but I'll let it wait for your response.
Thank you very much though, I can see you put a lot of effort into it.﻿

Is there any solution like this already exists in Bitcoin space?
Why I'm talking exactly about web-server based and redirect-based solutions, is just because all the other stuff is over-complicated, just imagine:
* Even if you have abundance of namecoin nodes (which is not the case, because there's no easy one-click installer), then you still should have skills on how to modify DNS settings on your device.
Why we can't keep it simple and just provide web-based solution, so that no settings has to be modified? (All you have to do - is find any synchronized web-server, and you don't need to trust anyone - you can setup your own web-server which automatically going to be synchronized with blockchain)

 trezor version - at the end: "You own Bitcoins?!?"

Elevator pitch:
1) How to get a name? Sign up for FREE on **any node**
2) Start your own naming webserver+node within a seconds
3) You can choose any name without old legacy ".com" or ".net", you don't need to get permission from anyone to use their zone, you can use any not taken naming space.
4) No need to modify any "network settings" just find out what is the web-address of your closest blockchain-node, enter it into your browser, navigate to "go to" form, and that's it you can enter any address in the space.
5) No need to install any software - you can use web-interface of the other nodes if you trust them, or you can use trust-less model in case if you want your own node
6) ONE-CLICK-INSTALL in case if you want to run your own web-serving blockchain-syncrhonizing node.
7) Unique opportunity: ONCE ANY DOMAIN NAME IS REGISTERED, IT REGISTERED FOREVER! No need to check out every half-year or every 2 years, once you've created the record for your name, you receive your permanent private key for maintaining your domain name (changing its redirect address). There's no procedures for deleting domain name. There's no procedures for prolonging your domain names. Afraid that everyone is going to take everything? Yes I agree some effort and job should get done for 1st time of creating domain name, but once you created it, you own it forever.

that is not a restaurant problem for me. That's a technical problem for those technicians who build better platforms to provide feedback platform to get other informed about ratings.
Just simple rating where you can click "dislike" for the case when you had to spent your cash at location which didn't accepted Bitcoin would totally change situation!
