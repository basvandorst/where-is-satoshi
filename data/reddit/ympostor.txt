Well, that's the same argument BCashers bring up all the time about lightning, and I think it's moot. Think about it: merchants already have this requirement even if they only accept VISA. They need to be online otherwise they don't know if they received the payment. Now on to the sender: if it's really an issue that the sender needs an internet connection, the merchant might even consider facilitate that. Imagine, you walk into a store, you want to pay something, and at the moment of payment an ad-hoc wifi hotspot gets created for you when scanning their payment QR code.

Then let's measure the future in predictability-percentages.
It's very close to 100% predictability that tomorrow the sun will rise, definitely.
But my point is, to illustrate it with numbers, that when people say it is cheaper to pay a mortgage than to pay rent, they are saying it with the same confidence that its predictability is kinda high, in the same way when people say that investing in buying a house is always good because housing prices never decrease. As the past has demonstrated, this has been wrong in some cases and places, so its predictability is not as high as the 100ish of sun rising tomorrow.

Again you're associating left with being pro-state. I'm sorry, you've got a lot to read. (For example, if you read Karl Marx, you'll find out that Communism is actually a way of governance that doesn't have state. Unfortunately, the "communist" parties in this world we live in, nowadays, don't resemble to that idea at all, but are actually the opposite.)


I'm sorry, you're nowhere close. Socialism, at least in its first conceptualization, was a way to use the state as a transition period towards the constitution of a communism (and the latter is, as I have already told you, absent of state). Anarchism ideology also has this end goal, but consists of advocating the change through the society itself, without the help of government.

Libertarianism has to do with liberty, not free trade. I mean, free trade is an instrument to achieve liberty. However, the end goal is not free trade. There are many libertarian-compatible ideologies that advocate for taxing (minimal taxing though, only mainly towards natural resources) such as Geolibertarianism. Read more about it here:

@_date: 2016-06-26 11:23:01


Well, yes. Money is property. Property is a fictitious concept that societies create to exchange value. But in order for property to work, it needs to be preserved somehow.


That seems to take care only for the active part of defending a property, but not the passive part (i.e. when the property has been violated, you need punishment, and you need an authority to execute that punishment; nowadays we have courts and other legalese systems for this; how are your "non-monopoly security companies" going to claim their right to punish the violation of property? not trying to be snarky here, this is a really interesting thing to discuss).


Left libertarianism is well documented, google it. The only one who could be doing a ridiculous move here is you by assuming that right-libertarianism is the only libertarian school of thought that has ever existed.




That natural resources belong to no one is the reason to tax to those who end up owning them in an hypothetical geolibertarian regime. "Not belonging to anyone" is a reason for the rules of the system, not a rule of the system, because property is still a defended value by left/geo-libertarians.

What doesn't make sense at all is your comparison. Think about it: rape exists, everybody knows it, it's a bad thing that can happen, it's a fact.
However, property is a concept, a social convention. For the social convention to work, it needs a framework to act as a base for it. That framework is the law, as I see it.


That's certainly an interesting thought. If punishment would work like this, however, it leads me to think that the worst part of our current legal system, the fact that nowadays the wealthiest people have access to the best lawyers and therefore can defend themselves better, would get a new dimension: even if the asshole steals your television, if he has enough money no security company is going to ever think about terminate any contract with him.


That's what you simply believe, it's just an opinion, not a fact. Go and try to debunk theories from left-libertarians like Oscar Wilde and Noam Chomsky, good luck with that! I could also say that your right-libertarianism is contradictory because it advocates for a concept, the property, without any system that protects it, or with property itself as a protection (as I explained above), which makes it absent of a root base.


I'll read about that, thanks for pointing it out.
I'll finish with just a thought: if there's no authority whatsoever that con protect the property (i.e. in an hypothetical situation in which bitcoin has become so mainstream that government doesn't manage to enforce taxation, and therefore ends up disappearing), then think about this: corporations will be the biggest attractors of wealth, because they will own the machines that automate the transformation of natural resources into consumable resources. But then there will be a crisis in which people will see all that inequality generated by the system (one caused by a much-less corrupted system, granted, because of the absence of fiat money, but still it will be able to generate inequality), then they would revolt against the owners of the machines (e.g. workers squatting a factory), and there will be no central authority that defends the property of the factory owners.
We shall see, or not (because this transition may take decades if not centuries). But at least we agree in thinking that cryptocurrencies can bring systems which are a bit more fair than the current ones.

Can you explain how zero-taxation would actually work and make libertarianism viable? Property is a fundamental principle of libertarianism, yet if you reduce taxes to zero, who is going to enforce the legitimate access to that property (forbidding or punishing access to the ones that don't own the property)?
As you can see, there's a limit to everything. You cannot be libertarian extremist because you get into a contradiction. You need the state to enforce the concept of Property.
That's why left-libertarianism is a thing. They advocate for reducing taxes to an absolute minimum, and the minimum is the logical tax of reducing the unfair aspect of owning natural resources (i.e. land), because natural resources, in theory, belong to none, or all of us.
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:18:48

That is the typical argument against RBE, which is easy to debunk.
When RBE proponents say that automating society completely would lead to the reduction of scarcity, the don't mean it in an absolute way but rather in a relative way, that is, scarcity regarding, especially, the needs of the people (not the wishes/desires) in a first level, and the rest in a second level, always **within reason**.
What does 'within reason' mean? Within reason means that RBE couldn't ever work in a society which is not well-educated. Being well-educated in this case would mean that you don't put your priorities before the priorities of the planet or the human race itself, and you would know perfectly that using the "system" to benefit yourself at the expense of the rest of your peers would be morally wrong. The planet is not infinite, therefore your desires shouldn't be either.

Peter Joseph is not involved in the Venus Project. He just featured it in one of the films, but he has parted ways with them. I also think VP is crap. The general idea of the 2nd and 3rd Zeitgeist movies is the one I wanted to focus on, for this argument.


I think gold/cryptocurrencies/austrian-economics are a much better way to deal with scarcity in a system where we still need currencies, definitely.
But Peter Joseph talks about an era in which we don't need currency anymore. A resource-based economy. In a way, I think bitcoin will be the transition to that.

The hardware wallets' model of trust is entirely different, it's about trusting the manufacturer of the device you bought, like when you use some opensource software (e.g. a wallet), you trust the developers of that software.
But for this TeeChan to work you have to trust the device that other person owns. And at the moment the private key of intel gets compromised, then all transactions are useless and funds could be stolen. But with hardware wallets there's no private key that the manufacturer needs to keep secret, there's a hardware design that needs to be secure, which is an entirely different thing.

Don't be simplistic/reductionist. I don't oppose bitcoin. I'm all for bitcoin at the current times. But when we have a much more fair market than we have today (i.e. when crypto is more used than fiat), a RBE would be the logical next step.
Right now in your mind you think of the RBE as something diametrically opposite to cryptocurrency, and in a way I can kind of understand where you're coming from. But you need to exercise your mind a bit more to maybe imagine which other intermediate steps that could happen between all-crypto and all-RBE, for example, a basic-income implemented via cryptocurrencies, in which the assignment of basic funds is not orchestrated by the state/government, but by an algorithm and a network (I mention a network on top of the algorithm, because an algorithm alone without network verification, could be prone to sybil attacks which would invalidate the basic rules of a basic-income distribution system).
After basic-income is implemented, there's just another step in which people would realize that the extra income they get from their jobs would be needed less and less, thanks to the level of automation of our technology (which would get rid of the element of scarcity in our societies, key element that explains the need for a capital-based economy).

That's a very good question indeed.
As I see it: let's think first from a microeconomic point of view, i.e. tracking individuals to enforce economic regulations on them and the like. This would be a huge task (only viable via complete surveillance) for little gain (because in the end the people are actually the least offenders when it comes to tax evasion and other crimes). In a future economic situation in which cryptocurrencies are more used than fiat, this would be an impossible endeavor.
Now think about it with a macro-economic point of view. It's actually the (medium/big) corporations the ones to blame for most tax evasion and economic crimes, the ones that actually are most likely to commit activities not in accordance with the regulation, not the people. Engaging in regulation enforcement aimed at corporations is less complicated because invading the privacy of corporations (contrary to invading the privacy of individuals) scales, and give much more gains. In a future economic situation in which cryptocurrencies are more used than fiat, this would be an even easier endeavor than it is today, because blockchains are completely transparent, and therefore easier to audit. Governments would just need some initial basic rules, in the line of what exist today in countries such as Norway, in which transparency is king: for example, cryptocurrency addresses should be linked by law with their entity names registered in government records (therefore, it boils down to forbidding HD wallets for companies). Company insiders collaborating with the prosecutors would be an extremely likely thing to happen if enough is spent on education (it happens nowadays already thanks to platforms like Wikileaks).

I don't think LN architecture would encourage anyone to open payment channels with merchants. Most likely there will be roughly a LN hub-node per country, and you would open a channel with it big enough to cover all your expenses for one month, for example.

Banks today lend money that they don't have in the first place. However, LN hubs cannot do this.
Banks today run with your funds if they got bust. However, payment-channel deposits would go back to you after the lock time expires if a LN hub dies.
Banks need bureaucracy and checks to let you open an account. With LN hubs, you still can create as many BTC accounts as you want with a single click.
Plus, anyone can potentially become an LN hub. (This doesn't happen with banks.)

Even if in Ethereum's supply inflation never goes to zero, it's still determined by an algorithm that makes it decrease as time passes (not an escolanted decrease like bitcoin's 4-year halvings, but a gradual one), so potentially the value (compared to fiat) may actually keep going up like bitcoin.

You're right in the fact that you shouldn't trust binaries blindly. That's why all my .NET code is built in .NET Standard libraries, which later I can consume with either Mono or .NETCore depending on my needs. And Mono is packaged in most distros like Debian or Ubuntu (from sources).

I've been doing that since 2 years ago. I understand that it takes a while to realize this, but fiat can be printed indefinitely by politicians, therefore it's normal that, if we keep measuring the price of bitcoin in fiat units of account, it will always go up. It's not that bitcoin goes up, it's that fiat will always go down.
This pay off will stop simply when the store next door starts listing prices in BTC. That day will arrive. Until that day, putting money in BTC instead of on a bank account, will always be more profitable.

He's comparing nLockTime with CLTV.


The amounts are always the same (e.g. 10bits), that's why even if you see the amounts, you cannot distinguish what amount corresponds to what payment.
@_date: 2017-05-03 07:55:06


Wrong, here's an explanation from the author of TumbleBit of why it doesn't depend on SegWit while LN does:
"SegWit is not required for TumbleBit. The freezing attack is not possible, but I think I understand the confusion.
The freezing attack is possible if you use relative timelocks via CSV or traditional timelocks, but we use absolute CTLV timelocks which doesn't need SegWit.
You could actually do Lightning with absolute CTLV timelocks and you wouldn't need SegWit, but then you'd have to renew your lightning channel every X days, but lightning choose to pursue the more elegant/efficient solution (relative timelocks using CSV) but that also means they need SegWit."


Wrong, in TumbleBit the amounts are not revealed either. Please read about TumbleBit.
@_date: 2016-10-18 03:01:37


This doesn't make any sense. Once a channel gets a balance lower than what a transaction fee may cost, there's no point of debating anymore about that channel, as it's depleted already.

No, because even if tumblebit is not used along with CT, the only thing revealed is the funding transaction of the payment channel, which has an arbitrary amount that may not correspond at all to what you end up paying.

tumblebit achieves same or more level of privacy as CT, and yes it's related to segwit because it's a layer2 solution that doesn't depend on malleability fixes.
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:13:10
Given this, scalability (e.g. layer2) would even be more needed in case the majority of people use CT.
But then you have to solve the same problem at the layer2 level, and CT is not enough (it's only fixing it at layer1).
Looks like a better solution is to use TumbleBit, which achieves layer2 **and** the level of privacy of CT, **and** without depending on SegWit.

I basically agree with this but it is a bit incomplete. Money creation from thin air (legal counterfeiting) is not only done by governments via inflation, it is also done much by banks through lending and fractional reserve. Bitcoin would also stop this, and with this, it would also kill the giant bubble of derivatives. This way, a lot of the wealthy today would be much less wealthy or at least stop getting more wealthy via these unfair means of extracting value from the rest of the society.

who can tell that some address is owned by an Iranian?

Same here.  is not right. I've even found a bitcoin-related job and got my salary in bitcoins now.

I see wealth inequality super great now, it's the FED and their friends, versus then the rest of the world. I think a meritocracy is better than a tyranny.

And this is only the numbers they tell us. But inflation could be much higher under the hood. Not to mention that the inflation produced by banks when they lend money via fractional reserve, is not accounted for.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:27:44
What's that bs about not spending your coin? That doesn't help usage numbers go up, only price. You should help spread awareness and try to use it in your daily life, asking all merchants you use to start accepting it. TLDR: don't HODL, SPEND&amp;REPLACE
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:26:21
how can the government know that the BTC address is Iranian?

The thing is, it doesn't matter.
What I mean is: I would prefer him to be in prison if he really was guilty of murder-for-hire. But we have the "innocent until proven guilty" mantra in our judicial system for a reason. It's better that a guilty man walks out the door than an innocent going to prison. So whatever the reason was to not have charged for murder-for-hire, he deserves to only pay the price for only the other charges, which are minor. Let him free now.

@_date: 2016-07-01 14:52:59


It's completely normal that I didn't understand it because it doesn't make much sense. First: if you wanted to compare "rape" to "property" you should compare first equivalent concepts such as "stealing" vs "rape", not "property" vs "rape", because the latter is the violation of a moral value, not a moral value that an ideology defends. Second, I never wanted to grant Government the ability to violate property. But there has to be an actor that can be the one to be "impartial" when there are disputes, as simple as that.


Some people being wealthier than others might be acceptable, I never opposed to that. What I opposed is that the wealthier people have more rights than others. And I mean inherent rights, such as justice, not property rights. No wealthier man should be more allowed to commit crimes than others that have less money, and yet it happens with any judicial system. Then imagine if corporations rule the world and there is no justice or courts? It would be even worse than it is now.


I completely agree with what you say about Bush. I'm libertarian, remember? I advocate for small governments, I despise the idea of very powerful governments and you mention that bastard and I feel enraged (especially because you might think I actually like these kind of bastards). But make no mistake, corporations can bring those kind of bastards as well. You seem to mention that corporations act in the market instead of in the political sphere, so they'll always be "fine", because they just "offer you goods and services, and if you don't like them, you simply should stop buying them and then they bankrupt". Sure, that's a very beatiful concept which I actually agree on as well. The problem is that reality is not that simple. There's no black and white. There's no "fiat system" vs "free market", because in an ideally free market system with no fiat and no regulations, corporations will also have advantages over other corporations or over the population in general, thanks to something called "monopolies". Even if you don't like a product or service from a company X, you might be forced to buy it if it's part of your needs of your daily life. And that company X might not have any more competitors because either it has acquired all of them, or because it has agreed on prices with them. And then you're left in the cold because there's no government or laws that can protect you from this.
See? There are good use cases for governments. Even if they're completely useless nowadays, they were created in the past for a reason. And with cryptocurrencies they will kinda disappear, and history will repeat itself, and we will be forced to create them again (although, maybe we create a better style of them that at least doesn't use fiat currency).


Of course, freedom is my highest value. Don't ever pretend that by despising inequality I'm despising freedom. Don't ever pretend to say they cancel each other, because you would need to back your arguments with a lot of data (which doesn't exist).


The thing that attracts me the most is that governments shouldn't have so much power so that they're able to fund wars. Because, wars, actually, are the biggest threat to freedom. There's no bigger threat to freedom than that. Even corporations are less of a risk than war, that's why I see them as a lesser of two evils. But what is sick is going back the other extreme and think that free market will be the solution of all of our problems. Wake up.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:25:52
It doesn't matter that you're still in the red. I'm guessing you still have fiat so whenever you want to spend some money, spend your bitcoins and buy back those coins with the fiat you would have spent.
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:57:01
Sorry but the tweet is full of jargon. What is a static address?
@_date: 2017-06-28 05:04:33
You guys didn't get it. There are two ways for a government to obtain taxes: a) via transparent-taxing of the citizens (determined in the laws, which would still apply to bitcoin) and b) via currency-inflation (quantitative easing). The latter will no longer be possible to do by governments, thanks to bitcoin. Governments will need to be transparent about the real taxes they get, in the laws. What they do now is make you think that they only obtain purchasing power via (a), but the majority comes from (b). With (b) gone, they will have to put real numbers when dealing with (a), not just "easy to digest" percentages.

I'm in kinda same situation as you.
If you have fears over things that can only happen with fiat currency (e.g. forfeiture), then don't cash out to fiat currency :)
What I'm doing myself is diversifying in altcoins (but not too many, just 3, the most important ones).
BTW I'm also frugal (no lambos for me either)! Congrats, and let's use this wealth wisely. People of the planet deserve a better system than the legacy fiat/banking system of before. Let's use our wealth to invest in things that takes humanity further. Live long and prosper.

so 10,000 BTC a trillionaire?
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:35:47
Let's see if you understand this: BTC is a new asset class. Something that is being learnt and discovered all the time by new people that approach the technology. Now, considering how its money supply deflates, think about this: the only way for bitcoin to go down in value is if every 4 years the amount of people interested in it halves. (Hint: to me, it's the opposite what's happening ;) )

IMO taxes don't matter wrt SPEDN&amp;RELPACE so long as he buys exactly the same amount of BTC he spends, and at the same time he spends it.
Or just easier: just move out of the US.

run a bitcoin wallet, hit the receive button, that's an address, i.e. the id you wanted

Same can be said about your last response, in which you avoided alluding the word which I most concentrated on: monopolies. This is the word that can be used for every single point you raise in your last answer. I'm not going to convince of how bad monopolies are.
Maybe the next governments we create after cryptocurrencies are not governments at all. Just some mini-institutions that try to combat monopolies created by corporations, so audited and transparent that give no room for the kind of bastards we both hate.
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:05:29
When can inflation happen without increasing the money supply?
