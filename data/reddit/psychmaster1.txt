Cause we really needed this

Why not let the public call it what they want. We already have tons of unofficial names for paper currency. Satoshi has too many syllables and people will think "what's with this Chinese bullshit". I'm just saying that's what people think. I've been following this for years and I still think it's pretty gay.

Or they just know that this is a place that many users will look at, and thus want to cover more than just one base.

Stop being so goddamn angry. Reddit didn't make you blind.

I couldn't agree more. Doing business in decimals of bitcoins is aesthetically unappealing to 99% of likely all people. It even sounded cheap to the people who I discussed Bitcoin with (in a completely unrelated manner). "oooh .01 Bitcoins! /s" If Bitcoin gets anywhere near the 10k range than it's going to be stupid dealing out ~.00001 for a meal at McDonald and right now the price never went anywhere to where it was supposed to be because the goddamn price tag was TOO DAMN HIGH for a single bitcoin. Soooo many people would have bought this shit if it wasn't dealt out in $1000 bills... I don't see why people have to be so goddamn stubborn about preference for the masses. Few people think in decimals and having a "whole" of something plays well with human psyche and isn't this what technology is all about?  I wouldn't want Bitcoin to succeed if the community didn't suggest changes that the general public wants? Isn't that the sentiment towards banks? "I want it done this way or that way". Well the general public wants some goddamn whole satoshis (that name has to change, its too long and unnapealing to general public. (Sat-osh-i vs Do-llar/cent) I'd suggest "coins" for whole coins and "bits" for fractions. Much more appealing and easier to conceptualize. 
A huge majority of this community is catering towards major internet people who live on bitcoins. Satoshi is not an attractive name unless you're jerking it to a picture of Nakamoto hanging from your ceiling which most people arent. Bitcoin is a great name because people know the word "bit" and "coin". Satoshi just sounds like some oriental soup. 
Good luck introducing that shit when this actually blows up.

Lutz or Sachow.... People like you are the exact type of people who should have nothing to do with naming. Both of those names are unrelatable to 99% of people. If you want to alienate everyone than fine, make ur own crypto and give it all the autistic names you want. 
The general user isn't going to know what the hell that stuff means and they want to adopt a friendly sounding currency. Bits and coins (for whole btc), as I've been saying, are the best names for the currency/value store: Bitcoin. People spend Bitcoin in the form of bits and coins and when this whole thing blows up, I guarantee that no one's gonna use Lutz, Satoshi, or sachows...

The reality is... Warren Buffet is the condescending one.

"guys, if you need a new knee while on your travels in Lithuania and you happen to have lots of Bitcoins, the local knee clinic is now willingly accepting them as a form of payment." 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:58:16
I don't think that's how it works. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:59:23
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:44:12
They need to be called "Bits" and a whole coin needs to be referred to as just "Coins". 
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:29:55
You're completely right. If bitcoin goes under completely than the tattoo will be absolutely retarded. They made the decision while they were high on money. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:38:54
This logo is where bitcoin goes to die. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:32:40
You're missing the point. This is a new currency/store of value, and if most people think reddit is the place for this info than they will make decisions based off it. Having a verified and not verified tag would help regardless of who "should"  or "shouldn't"  Be involved but as far as I understand, most of wants as many people as possible 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:13:44
You must have a shit ton of money and/or bitcoins to do that. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:13:06
Revolution of bitcoin is only impeded by those not willing to revolt. I understand much of eastern culture and sympathize with the decisions of many businesses, however, I think that these statements impede progress. Bitcoin does not revolve around China. It is now China's choice to either accept it as progress (as the US seems to have implied), or fall behind.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:45:30
I understand your point, condescending Internet man. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:36:24
So imagining bitcoin to possibly be worth a lot, which is incredibly possible, is delusional. But you get fake gold that costs $3 and you're heart skips. Who's the delusional one now? O.o

You know the price crashed when there's a suicide hotline on the front page of r/bitcoin

I really don't think that's a fair comparison. I mean come on... 35 days for the angry birds space app (which stemmed off the original massively popular game), compared to: Bitcoin - Something that requires a system in society between buyers/sellers/pay services/etc to hear about/discover, Understand it enough to investigate, have time to do that, and operate under an expectation it will pay off enough to warrant the time to learn enough to incorporate it into there active financial life as opposed to just an investment. 
If you consider the resent positive coverage the start of the widespread adoption. (As opposed when less people used/talked/understood it, and when it was talked about as a tool for crime) I would say that Bitcoin is doing exceptionally well for what it is, (3 months - since October) considering it is a brand new (complicated) idea/concept for the average person.
