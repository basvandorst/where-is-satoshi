That's the gamble. I am curious myself how the prices will maintain. Last time BTC hit 1K, it went way down. History does repeat itself, but who knows this time? On one hand, if you buy now and the price goes down, then you are losing money. But if you buy now and the price rises or stays the same, then it's a good idea that you bough now.   
But this all depends on how much you buy. If you want to buy a lot then it's not a good idea. For a little, it might not matter as much.

Nice! 
@_date: 2017-01-13 01:34:37
That's a cool goal. I might be able to help when you feel it's time. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 07:06:05
No, I have not. But I feel it defeats the purpose of Bitcoin being decentralized once you start adding bank like manipulation.

This ^

How did you get that with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-01-06 08:51:57
Checkout Coinbase if in the US. Its mentioned here quite often. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:22:29
Wow, that's an interesting life style. I would say something because I said no third party stuff, but the post alone makes up for it. These are pretty cool.

You confused me there. Do you mean that you bought a female cat as a companion for your male cat or found a female cat owner (person) to take care of your cat? Or sold your male cat to a female cat owner? Or something else? 
@_date: 2017-01-04 10:31:26
True, but not everyone cares. I have friends that have Bitcoin for the sole purpose of making a profit and not because they believe in the currency. That being said, I just don't see why it would annoy you if nothing bad is coming out of it. Is their more to the post? Maybe a story? 
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:15:56
Is this your setup? And do you have these graphs up 24/7?
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:24:00
No, you shouldn't take your downvotes, you're correct. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 10:33:51
Just like any other currency. You hold if you don't need anything that requires a transaction (ie. Buying something / paying someone) and spend when you do. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:25:00
I don't even known what that is, but why not just put it in the directory where its stored? Then your wallet will read the file. According to a quick Google search, that file goes in this directory: 
    ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallet.dat
Edit: and I think it goes without saying, but just in case it doesn't, the Library directory in OSX is hidden by default, so you will need to show hidden files in finder or just do it through the terminal - up to you.     
@_date: 2017-01-04 10:28:16
Well if it's not, something to think about is if you're infected with a virus. You said that wallet is on an Ubuntu virtual machine, but if the host machine has been compromised, I don't see why the virtual machine information could not have been accessed. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:34:06
You have to setup a Bitcoin wallet first. Then you will have a public key that you will use for your transactions. On a site like ShapeShift, you will first add your public key incase of refunds as well as your nxt address and then use your Bitcoin wallet to pay the amount that you want to exchange for nxt.

The link to my profile is [here]( if the above provides trouble.
@_date: 2017-01-04 10:23:03
It's not a bad thing. If anything it makes the price worth more because of demand. If one does not care enough to learn, then they don't and that's that, why does it annoy you? 
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:34:43
Just 10% of total price. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:28:29
Oh I see, was this owner someone you knew of were acquainted with? If not how did the payment through Bitcoin come up? To my experience, when I tell someone what Bitcoin is they either have never heard of if or don't own any. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:00:15
Well if you ever are interested, pm me with your ideal fee percentage and we can try to work something out. I am open to negotiation.  
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:41:44
Got it, that makes more sense now. Thanks for your comment. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 07:19:14
Well, good thing it is decentralised by nature, that's way the people that use it have a choice on how they want to use it. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:51:20
Sorry you confused me there, does this mean that you are no longer interested? 
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:03:44
How so? 
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:57:22
Nice! How did you buy it with BTC? 
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:19:27
My fee was updated to 4.75%, just letting you know in case you ever decide that you want to try it out. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:39:50
Do you mean personal game to BTC trades? 
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:05:13
Do you mean today? You are looking at the 1year chart, so it has been that low in a time span of 1 year, but not today. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:12:19
Well what about going to your local police? While far fetched due to this being a Bitcoin transaction, you do have phone numbers and an IP address. AND I don't know if your law will agree with this, but technically your Bitcoin is your property and therefore, your property being stolen should be worthy of a police report. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:07:34
Why? 
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:00:03
Not bad! Very interesting way to use it. Now I know when I travel that I can exchange my coins for place of travel currency. Very cool post!  
Edit: Or maybe I should say 'if I travel'. I don't currently have the funds for that. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:49:32
Meh, for people that like BTC for what it is, the price fluctuations don't really matter all that much, it's to be expected.  
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:41:28
Well, if anything, don't over think it, its just a currency like any other currency. I take it that by process you mean transactions. In a simplified view, when one person sends btc to another, the processed is completed with what are know as confirmations, which is done by the miners (the people who provide the computing power). Then these transactions are store in the block chain, which is the public ledger for all transactions.
But it would be easier to look it up, you can get a lot more information that is better explained.  
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:26:57
Yeah, but I'm trying to increase convenience. Unless the place you buy something from accepts btc, then you're out of luck. And there might be ways around it like Bitcoin debit cards or converting your coins to another payment form, but that can at times be tedious.

@_date: 2016-12-30 21:51:32
not relevant, the OP is predicting prices for btc not the transaction fees involved. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 08:54:44
But if the sources are different it gets very difficult to agree, I have had it happen to me before. I guess it's just the nature of Bitcoin and it has to be dealt with.    
@_date: 2016-12-31 21:21:43
It might be a cool opportunity if you know enough to offer to set up a system that allows them to take bitcoin for a fee. Its a win win situation.
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:47:10
Sounds good, thanks.
