The blockchain is for whatever people are willing to pay for it. 
 
That's how a decentralized system works, and sadly you don't get to arbitrate what is a fair use. 
 
Just like banks had to get used to the fact that bitcoin is a reality, you have to get used to the idea that creativity and fun on the blockchain is a reality.

To be fair, I was famous for going balls deep into financial long shots, and had been for years on forums like WallStreetBets - famously blowing up my account multiple times.  And I didn’t do it quietly either, but with a lot of arrogant gusto.   There was even a name for it, ‘going full pegasus’: taking out loans to gamble on speculative assets and then using those assets as collateral for a 100% margin long position in the same asset �� (which I literally did).  
  
There was no reason why I *shouldn’t* have been mocked for being so euphoric.... assuming you were going based off my word alone.  
  
I was just fortunate in 2015 I really saw a clear vision of everything at once - and was completely correct this time.  Thanks for posting this, it’s a nice dose of nostalgia.

Implying that I’m not alone now, and implying we are all not *always* alone in this current existence.  How many times have you ever truly been outside your own brain?  Even if you were surrounded by the most loving family you could wish for, they are still but perceptions (of complex external intelligences, but still merely perceptions).  Ultimately it is lonely in all of our minds, and so until true neural linking and exploration becomes a reality in future decades, we must learn to become quite comfortable with our own company.  Having a good relationship with your own neural net, and being aware of that relationship is a highly under-appreciated art.

Tried to start many businesses while living large and making a reputation for myself in Vegas and Hollywood.  Other crypto investments didn’t work out (lost a lot on those), none of the businesses worked, and eventually had to scale back the lifestyle further and further until I was just barely scraping by - and then not even that.  
  
It wasn’t *that* much money (not when you’re dropping a hundy k or two on trying to start various companies here and there: a crypto payment processing service, a luxury party company, shooting a tv pilot, etc).  
  
If you want more details, check out that imgur collage album.  It’s pretty surreal the difference in lifestyle between now and a couple of years ago.  Back in 2017 there was a time a friend came over and I had $50k just scattered on my coffee table and she was like ‘holy shit put that up somewhere’ and I was like ‘ehh, whatever’.  Lol one time I found five grand I had forgotten about in a beach bag.  
  
And these days?  Well, a week ago I found ten dollars in a jacket pocket and it was a huge windfall cause I could afford toilet paper and soap.  And they cut my cell phone off a month ago cause I couldn’t pay the bill, and some friends on Instagram got together and bought me a cheap discount plan so I could stay online.

Having to spend your brainpower grinding for meager survival really hurts, because you know you’re capable of so much more, but also... food and shelter.  
  
It gives you perspective that a LOT of the people who really need crypto can’t get into it cause they are desperately just trying to stay alive.  They don’t have any spare pennies, much less brainpower, for ‘magic computer nerd numbers’ - no matter how compelling the pitch.  
  
I’m glad I did good though, and you appreciate my writing.  I have people who told me I changed their thinking and lives, which feels good.  I just hope I’m able to find some way to keep going and climb back up from down here.  
  
Thanks for the sympathy and kindness.
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:42:33
Literally technically superior to Bitcoin, due to a tail emission that makes forking in a flexible and auto-scaling blocksize a real possibility without violating the social contract. 
 
So it's a joke, and it still suffers from a network too weak to protect itself, *plus* the same lack of privacy, but you're not wrong.
@_date: 2019-08-10 14:48:08
Ugh, sometimes I wish it were good opsec.  Sadly, I have many people in my life now who love me for *me* and i would love to reveal to them I’m secretly loaded and pay back some of the kindness they have shown to me.  
  
But that’s just a fantasy.  You can’t fake being broke like this.  I really am, and it’s brutal, and sometimes I do wish I had not gone so crazy deep with the business ideas... but also it was going crazy deep that made me the fortune in the first place.  So I can’t beat myself up over it too much.  
  
I have a few months to find a job (prepaid rent until November thankfully) but then I’ll be homeless, and well, *that* will be a new adventure at least.
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:17:19
No sadly, because the propagation of the Bitcoin blockchain itself is ruled by the speed of light.  We already have the perfect physical blockchain in existence, the transmission of light based information - but because that doesn't get around the speed of light we are still stuck in relevatistic time.  But nice try.

I predict that I’m gonna have to sell one of my last remaining pieces of music equipment (which hurts cause dj’ing is my dream now) to afford to wash clothes this week.  I tried hacking the machines with the q-tip trick, but they didn’t work.  They almost got JAMMED in there, which would have sucked, but thankfully that didn’t happen.  And every quarter is too precious to be spending $1.50 per load to wash (and ANOTHER $1.50 to dry).  And I desperately need clean clothes because otherwise I’m not gonna be able to look for a job and/or get dj gigs.  
  
Absolute poverty is a really scary feedback loop.  I need to find some kind of source of income soon, or else when November comes I’m gonna be homeless.  
  
That’s my prediction.

Me personally?  I currently get $190 a month from food stamps, which with LA prices doesn’t buy enough food. Sometimes neighbors feed me, which is nice.  It’s frustrating though, cause CalFresh (formal name for the program) doesn’t buy certain necessities like soap and toilet paper that I need.  I have a case worker down at the county supposed to get back to me about some kind of cash relief that will give me a little for that too.  Sadly, unemployment is brutal and I spend most of my time worrying about how I’m going to keep surviving.

Thank you.  It’s been quite the journey of self-awareness and discovery.  I’m always making new strides.  Just this year I found amazing new strength in living openly about my vulnerability and fear, versus feeling the need to hide it.  
  
When you truly have nothing to fear, you become much more confident in any situation.  You learn it’s okay to be wrong, to be weak, to be flawed.  Because you are not *inherently* those things; they are just a pathway you travelled down to get where you are.  And the fact that you don’t fear them means you don’t have to fear the future either, because you have a contract with that self to continue doing your best, and you know they are smiling back and supporting you.

On the flip side of what you’re saying, becoming a millionaire suddenly doesn’t seem like such an impossible dream anymore.

So wouldn't you know it?  In the twenty teens we put our money in this fancy new computah money called uh, bitscoin?  Bubba was always going on about how these blockchains was gonna take over the world.  One night when we was in the army, he listed all of them.  And boy, there was so many!  Well wouldn't you guess what, they ended up going up.  *Way up!*  
 
So after that, we didn't have to worry about money no more, which was nice. 
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:39:16
I was very rich for a while.  I learned many lessons, among those that wealth can make you very lonely.  It also gave me the courage to transition and leave the military, for which I am very grateful.  
  
Photo journey I made for Instagram a few days ago:  
  
  
These days I am broke, own no crypto, and most days struggle even for a meal or basic necessities.  Food stamps sadly don’t pay enough to realistically eat off of.  Currently searching for a job here in LA, and also trying to get gigs as a dj (been practicing for a year and I’m good).  Despite this, I have wonderful friends and a lot of love in my life.  
  
I’d love to get back into crypto one day.  I have a very good idea of where it is heading, and also have my eye on several key technologies.  I also feel I have a pretty good idea of what’s gonna happen next with the markets as well.  I don’t really care to talk about it out loud because a.) i can’t afford to put any weight behind those predictions, so they don’t matter and b.) not sure why someone on food stamps and struggling should be making crypto price predictions or be listened to for financial advice on anything at all.  
  
I wish everyone the best, as I’m sure you will for me.  If anyone wants to keep up with me as a person, I’m usually on insta these days:   Please don’t ask me for advice about crypto though, unless it’s a job offer.

It wasn’t a clear and precise feeling, though in early childhood I did have lots of day dreams about being accepted by and getting to play with the girls at school.  
  
There was no ‘trans’ where I grew up, and the representation in the media was terrible.  I knew something was wrong, just not quite what.  
  
And then puberty was truly terrible.  I felt like I was going crazy, and I didn’t like the changes my body was undergoing.  I remember begging my mom to please stop it and let me be a little boy forever.  
  
I figured in my late teens if I was stuck as a man I’d be the best man I could, so I did.  I rose to a high rank in the military and got swole.  It didn’t make me happy.  I was miserable.  
  
Thanks to the internet and Reddit I discovered what hrt was and saw a lot of inspiring trans women living their best lives.  It gave me hope I could do it too.  I took years and years to think about it, and at last it was clear to me there was no other way - as terrifying of a plunge as it was.  Looking back, I still can’t believe I did it.  I was honestly more scared of coming out than anything in my entire life.  
  
But the first time I took testosterone blockers and supplemental estrogen?  Well that was like doing a narcotic.  It was wonderful, and as if a poison I had been under my whole life vanished and this beautiful new thing was taking its place.  
  
Since then I’ve grown boobs, gotten cuter, and my brain and body have changed a lot as a result of the second puberty the hormones create.  As well my pheromones and body smell have changed, which has led me to just being subconsciously accepted by women as ‘one of their own’ which is also wonderful.  After a lifetime I finally have the giant circle of girlfriends I always dreamed about.  And most importantly I feel pretty, and like myself.  I’ll always be a little bit androgynous, and certainly not a super model.  But for me it’s good enough.  I’m happy, and I’m just sad it took so long to get here, but I’m grateful for the journey.

So organically there has been a story at the top of Futurology praising Elon, SpaceX, or Tesla for YEARS with anyone who questions it ridiculed and downvoted? (Like you’re doing now)
  
Even after he went all childish with the diver comments, accounts was working overtime to bury that.  No, that’s not organic.  It smacks exactly like the informational warfare of the presidential campaigns went.  Straight the fuck up astroturfing.

Being treated as if you are only as good as your money is one of the most socially painful things imaginable.  
 
I suspect it's the same kind of pain the very beautiful experience all the time - to be held on a pedestal for this one silly quality while the real you inside feels ignored and unwanted.

You are so wrong in so many ways, though perhaps your heart is in the right spot. 
 
You can't incentivize full nodes because of something called the "sybil problem".  That is, at a certain point it becomes more lucrative to fake full nodes on the network than actually provide them.  There is no way to perfectly distinguish real nodes from imposter nodes, since setting up a new node (unlike mining) doesn't carry a significant cost.  If you can figure out a working solution for this conundrum, you will solve an important problem in computer science. 
 
Also, you don't fully understand how mining secures a network.  You should spend more time reading and reflecting on the nature of what actually makes a blockchain secure.  (hint: it's the mining) 
 
Because mining is so heavily incentivized, Bitcoin is free from a 51% attack.  Any rewards that don't go to the miners directly weaken the network by removing inventive.  Additional full nodes are not worth weakening the network.

He is the same type of clown that called Bitcoins worthless a few years ago.  To say that alt coins have a massive uphill battle against Bitcoin and most are worthless is true.  To write them all off is foolish. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:52:31
�� The fact that you don't think privacy and scalability are huge innovations is absurd.  Both of those cryptonotes have a flexible blocksize and are private by default - makes Bitcoin look like ARPANET compared to the actual internet. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 04:27:58
It's Monero's little sibling and it's cute.  Something about it I can't explain is just really attractive.  Not basing my affection strictly on hard facts, mainly feels ��, even though it is an ethically and equitably launched Monero fork so it has street cred.  But I hold a lot of it and am a mod there so take what I say with a big grain of salt.

@_date: 2018-02-24 20:04:10
If it were possible to fully incentivize nodes and perfectly protect from node spoofing, you could create a coin that did away with mining entirely for its security model. 
 
But you can't do that. 
 
Also full nodes simply don't do much once you have an adequate minimum threshold.  Bitcoin works just as well with 1000 nodes as it does 100,000.  The same cannot be said for mining.  We need more miners, and the solution to mining centralization in China is better memory hard algos (see monero).

I think it's on the downslide and will finally recover once everyone gives up hope and thinks Bitcoins are dumb again.  If you look up posts from my old screen name americanpegasus in 2015 on this subreddit, you'll see people saying really nasty things to me for suggesting that Bitcoin would be over $10k in a few years. 
 
Once people respond to euphoria with hate and ridicule en masse, it's definitely time to buy.  Once people respond to the idea of selling with hate and ridicule en mass its definitely time to sell. 
 
Most of my crypto is in Aeon right now, but am also very interested in Grin tech (not out yet) and Tari (Monero secondary layer).  But I also was really interested in Counterparty, and despite being wonderful tech has done pretty awful price wise.  So I can frequently be wrong too - no one is a perfect oracle, especially not me. 
 
I don't think granddaddy Bitcoin is a bad place to park money at all.  Likely the safest and most stable crypto by far. 
 
Of note, back in 2015 when I predicted this bubble's peak (around $25k so I was a bit off), I also predicted a following low of $2,000.  I really hope I'm a bit off on that one too, but we'll see.

It went from 30 cents each to $150 each.  Ummm.  I think it did okay.  Maybe not $SPY returns, but 15,000% return in a few years isn't that bad.

Dunning Krueger, get it right.  
@_date: 2018-07-05 07:00:48
Okay, so you don't really understand what Bitcoin is, or what cryptonote is, or what Aeon is.  You are just repeating things other people said that you don't really understand, and when challenged you just push that off onto someone else. 
 
Because deep down you're scared... Scared you are in over your head and don't have enough knowledge to discern truth from fiction so you cling to Bitcoin hoping nothing better ever exists cause you won't be able to discern it if it does. 
 
Sounds like you're the one who needs to do some reading babe ��

@_date: 2018-04-24 17:50:16
If I were Facebook I would certainly aim for the third implementation.  Form Bitcoin into a proprietary version while increasing the coin count to 50 million and gifting my own corporation 10 million of those new coins.  Keep 10 million as air drops to all current Facebook users and earmark 5 million as bounties for watching ads.  Increase the block size back to 25 and use the remaining "new" coins to incentivize miners to mine the $FB fork. 
 
Also partner with Samsung (developing Bitcoin ASICS) to ensure that hash power hits the Facebook network... Possibly even form a corporate merger of sorts.  In time, when the old chain was flagging behind the new $FB approved one, use the ASIC dominance to kill it outright. 
 
I didn't say this would be good, at all.  I'm just saying if I was Facebook and a purely rational actor without any larger morals this is exactly what I would do to effectively take over Bitcoin. 
 
Hell, 50 million?  Why are we even messing around? Let's issue the final coin count as 100 million, make the block rewards 100 coins, and issue a 50% dev mine straight to Facebook's corporate wallet.  Because fuck the users, that's why.  They'll see "free Bitcoins" and jump all over it without realizing they are signing away their freedom.

Awwwe!  Thanks ☺️.  
  
These days I hang out on Instagram a lot.  Feel free to look me up: 
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:36:52
I and my girlfriends accept myself just fine.  
  
It’s you who is having trouble accepting reality.  
  
And I’m quite happy with myself, and have no care in the world about how you live your life.  I just know that before I came out I had an inordinate interest in trans people because I secretly was very curious about them and wanted to live vicariously through them.  Also I subconsciously thought that maybe if I could logically disprove their existence then I could at least eliminate forever the possibility of *me* being trans.  
  
And here you are, overly concerned with trans people.  Just like I used to be when I was closeted.
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:20:12
Winter must have come to West Virginia finally, cause I’m lookin up at some triggered snowflakes.  
  
Trans people like me take female hormones and identify as female.  It doesn’t affect you what I do with my body, and the only reason it likely concerns you is because you aren’t completely confident of your own gender or sexuality.   
  
Go deal with your own damage and leave me out of it.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:00:23
Doctors, science, and established international medicine disagree.  
  
You clearly have done little to no research about trans people if you think they all take injections.  Sometimes nature makes mistakes and gives a brain testosterone when it should have been giving it estrogen.  
  
We have the medicine to fix that.  Since transition I am happier, have more friends, am more creative, and finally love myself and body like never before.  This isn’t about me.  This is about you, and your outrage that I have transitioned to be a woman when you evidently have gender dysphoria but insist on not addressing it.  
  
You’re like a burn victim getting made at another burn victim for using skin grafts to restore themselves.

When you meet women on the internet, do you feel entitled to strike up a conversation about their genitals - and if you did would they actually bother to answer?
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:34:17
So once again, because you are in denial: scientific and medical consensus (and most major corporations even) agree I am a woman.  You don’t need to debate me about this - you should go to medical school and then challenge the overwhelming majority of doctors internationally that are quite clear on the matter.  It doesn’t matter what half-bit talking points you bring up.  You simply don’t get to have an opinion about this because a.) it doesn’t affect you and b.) you aren’t qualified.  
  
Secondly, I’m just a trans person living her life with lots of great girlfriends around me and a body I love.  You’re the one who has a problem with that.  
  
You need to start focusing on why you care so much about trans people.  Most cis people are just going about their lives alongside trans people all cooperating and having a good time.  Everyone here in the normal world is fine.  I take female hormones and I love the new life they have given me.  Everyone in my life likes the new me too.  
  
You’re the one who wants to deny accepted science and is overly concerned about trans people.  Before you are allowed to use the world ‘science’ again, you need to go do a basic google search about “what does science say about transgender people”.
