A motive is often required to establish a crime.  What motive would CZ have to forge a signature?  I don't think it was in his job description or performance target as CTO to get bitcoin.com signed.
OKCoin / Star has been paying (in a delayed/unprofessional, or maybe even attemped illegal fashion) for months.  Jack has at least reviewed the contract.  Roger has pointed out to Jack that there is no cancellation clause back in Feb.  It's obvious OKCoin has been trying to either void or get out of the contract for some time...  OKCoin have every motive, mean, and opportunity to forge the contract.
 if you are still working for OKCoin, it's time to look for a new job.  It won't be there for much longer!

Look at page 1 of the email transcripts.  Feb 23, Roger sent v7 to Jack, Jack read it, and Roger pointed out there is no cancellation option on OKCoin's part.  any brain cells there?

You should pay $1,000,000,000, as you are asking people to do the impossible.  faking a cryptographic signature to suit the content.
To be clear, I hate OKCoin.  I am a basher.

You (OKCoin) created reddit account to mimic memorydealers (Roger).  Trying to confuse users?  now, that is classic...
Is the CEO of OKCoin a 3 year old kid?  Tim Draper should fire his ass by now.  Wait, maybe that was faked too...

Totally possible, get your funds out.  Why take the chance?  Go to Bitfinex.

OKCoin reduced their office size by half about a month or so ago.  Not sure about their headcount.

The site has 2500 new IPs visiting every day, mostly from google search, not a bad way to funnel traffic to an exchange or wallet.

I don't think it matters that much who has signing authority when everything is exposed.  Page 1 in the transcript, Feb 23, Jack receives the contract.  Reviewed it.  Page 2, Roger explains OKCoin doesn't have a right to cancel.  Page 1, Jack says the contract is passed from Star to him.  Obviously, many people in OKCoin have seen the contract...  
OKCoin are a bunch of liars. But this is taking it a little too far. The only reason I see them doing this is they are completely insolvent.  Not even able to pay $20k USD. 
Don't be the last one to get your money out, as there probably won't be enough left.

Faking a lawyer has some serious consequences!!!
