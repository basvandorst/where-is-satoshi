Bitcoin attracts people from many different backgrounds, and I don't think everybody can be an expert on everything.   
I don't expect a stats junkie to understand the nuances in the associated security risks when considering CSV vs XLS.  I also think it is reasonable to not have to "want" to be worried about malware when considering a data set.  Sure I could do X Y or Z to be safe, but personally that's time out of my day I'd rather be spending on something more important.
So if you want to hate people for not wanting to run malware risks or sink time, go ahead, but I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask for a clean copy of the data if they just want to crunch numbers/verify claims.

The question you ask is a very, very broad one.
I won't go into the different sides of the debate, but such a change would require altering bitcoins consensus rules.
In order to change a consensus rule, it is expected that you convince an overwhelming majority (95%) of participants that it is a good idea.  IIRC, there has yet to exist a block size change proposal to achieve that level of support.

I'm struggling to make the case for any of these...
It's not fraud, it's not IP infringement, it's not multi-level marketing.
You could make the case for "predatory or deceptive", but per their definition it still seems a little thin:
*Investment opportunities or other services that promise high rewards; Sale or resale of a service without added benefit to the buyer; resale of government offerings without authorization or added value; sites that we determine in our sole discretion to be unfair, deceptive, or predatory towards consumers*

No, I would not.  Because when I present data or arguments I (try to) do so in a calm, objective manner.  Be the bigger man, slinging insults only discredits you and your claims.
Also, I tend to agree with "shady file" argument, and that the data should be posted publicly in a simple format.  Leave it to the consumers of the data to apply their own formulas, or include basic instructions for what formulas you applied.

@_date: 2016-04-28 19:12:57
Oh, I get it.  But it's a straw man argument, it doesn't change the fact that they have been, and still are, a good way to obtain bitcoin.
Furthermore you have to entrust something with your keys, whether it's your operating system, a hardware wallet, a printed QR code, or even a brain wallet.  They all run risks, nothing is foolproof, it's about what reasonable risk you personally are willing to take, coupled with convenience tradeoffs.
Don't want to use coinbase? Fine, but don't pretend your alternate solution is riskless, and stop shitting on a company that has a reasonable degree of trust to date.

If it's protocol oriented, why do I need a hardware device?
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:11:36
If you want to be super safe:
* burn an ubuntu (or whatever) bootable iso
* hook up a non-network printer to your computer
* reboot off the CD (&amp; reboot the printer)
* goto the paper wallet generator site, once it loads kill your network connection
* generate a new paper wallet &amp; print it
* restart everything on your network including the router/modem
You now have a "safe" paper wallet you can send funds to.

Until a transaction is confirmed, it's considered unspent/still your money.  You can export the private key corresponding to the unspent output that is "stuck" into a different wallet and attempt to spend it again with a more reasonable fee in order to get it "unstuck."


RBF stands for Replace By Fee.  It's a wallet option you can enable which makes it easier to adjust the fee so you don't have to sweep.
Both of these scenarios are only applicable scenarios where you are sending a transaction from a wallet that you control, and for RBF only if your particular wallet software supports it.  If you buy coins via Coinbase or Gemini, then these terms/procedures do not apply, as they are the ones in control of your coins (like a bank.)

Uxtos in unconformed txes only get spent when included in a block, the miners get to choose which tx to include.

What happens if a non-trivial amount of miners signal for segwit, but then reject SW TXes after it gets locked in?

@_date: 2017-02-21 21:04:25
I care about the important things, you are whining about...being into bitcoin for longer? Not liking it when people call ethereum a shitcoin? 
I read through the rest of your post history, and I think you are the one who doesn't get it.  
[You don't understand why segwit is important]( you [believe that LN requires segwit]( (it does not) and in the same comment you praise ethereum for being turing complete.  Hah.
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:38:13
You can, but it is important to understand the difference in wallet types here, as only deterministic wallets support this fully.
For example: If you ran bitcoin core prior to 0.13.0 (non-deterministic wallets) you could copy your wallet to another computer, but only the first 100 receiving addresses would be present in both places.  Once you exceeded those addresses the wallets would begin to diverge.
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:09:40

I lol'd.
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:31:21
Ok, I'll bite. 
For one, reducing the pro-segwit argument down to "Everyone should be able to run a node" is misleading.  If OP believes that's all that is on the table regarding segwit then OP should probably not be commenting on the topic.  OP even admits he does not understand, yet this rationale still holds up to some?
For two, "Letting miners set blocksize" that isn't how validation works, as evidenced by what happened after the incident on Jan 29.  
This sort of "I don't understand, but I'm here to fix bitcoin!" is what I find really toxic.  It turns logical discourse into mudslinging, character attacks, and this reducing/twisting of information in an attempt to sway some kind of reddit favor that has no value.
@_date: 2017-02-08 21:24:38
Disagree.  That hate over there is literally hate.
The "hate" over here is something like this:
Ver appears disingenuous to me.  I believe his motives are self serving.  I really hope he doesn't fuck this all up for the rest of us.
Andressen is more of a mystery, but retains little credibility after reading his blog posts and the whole CW debacle.
Armstrong I'm more meh.  He's the coinbase guy, right?  Personally I always liked coinbase.
I don't actually know why the other two are relevant to bitcoin today.

@_date: 2017-02-14 21:11:28
FWIW I think segwit is a good idea, and I do not have a suggestion to offer you, but "______ is the only way!" is a flawed argument that often leads to "we have to do something, ______ is something, let's do that!" which is equally flawed.
You and I are two people, there are plenty of others trying to improve things too.  To disregard those efforts with a message of "I can't do it so nobody else can either" is limiting.

I honestly hope we see more diversity in the coin ecosystem.  Some allege "there can be only one" but I don't think that is true.  At least not anymore.
It seems unlikely that we will be able to implement the superset of features on all the wishlists out there into one solution.  There are simply too many things that people want which have polar opposites to things that other people want.  And that's ok.  
I think it's great that people want and are passionate about using a coin with *particular* feature sets, but seriously just go and *do* it already.  Go find them or implement them elsewhere, stop dicking around with one which already has a clearly defined priority list and roadmap.

Perceived abuse of power in this subreddit evidenced by ongoing censorship amongst other things.
is the primary news/discussion outlet for many bitcoin users, and to see such controlling/elitist behavior is a bit of a turnoff.
Abuses range from breaking reddit functionality via the custom stylesheet, to censorship of conversations contrary to the mods, even outright lies in regards to the roadmap.
On one hand it makes me sick, on the other hand I suspect these assclowns have no actual power over bitcoin anymore, they are just abusing what little power they still have for the moment.

BU has no place in this conversation.  
My point is that the rigorous testing and review of every line of code doesn't happen for the non-core contributions to knots, and that you subject yourself and the network to those risks by running it.

I think the distinction between block size increase vs fit more within the same block size is important. 
Segwit is the latter. It should not be confused with the former. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:43:25
It's been bad lately.  
The poisonous messages regarding censorship, the mad scramble to "scale" without good understanding of the "why", even some of the people I thought to be more level headed are now just contributing noise, impacting the signal to noise ratio of good information.
I think the important takeaway here is that everyone needs to do their own research, investigate individual claims, and decide on their own.  Don't listen to the meatheads attempting to co-opt this subreddit.  
We don't need more argumentative behavior, we need to abandon those who are attempting to draw a divide between us and try to bring constructive insights to the table.

I don't think anybody can refute his contributions.  He's also a very cool dude, I almost always see him calmly explaining things to people or otherwise trying to help.  It's commendable, I wish more of us could be like him.
But the exposure from being present in the other sub, battling personae akin to t_d, is a little confounding to those those of us who disregard them as irrelevant.  It's a timesink. And for what?
I understand his motives are to enlighten those who could otherwise be led astray, but I also worry about the possibility of any perceived legitimacy gained by being directly engaged by such a prominent player.
He told me "But no man is an island. Bitcoin, in particular, gains value from network effects. The ignorant will suffer from their own ignorance, but the people around them can suffer too."  I dunno.  I didn't reply, but I still wrestle with the first statement.  I believe we are each individually burdened with the pursuit of truth.

It's possible, but unlikely to be successful unless a very large group of miners and nodes is involved.
If 20% of the hash rate forked to a new chain, block times for the new chain would be 4x as long (for 2 months!)

Hey Greg, nice to see more of these coming out, keep up the great work! What follows are just my own personal opinions and should always be taken with a grain of salt.




One of these descriptions is really good, the other one is vague and not super helpful, maybe combine these statements into a stronger one?
The locktime field notes seem a little thin.  I notice I can click to get more information, but maybe include a few more words as to *why* I would want to include a locktime in the future rather than just the plain explanation?
Finally, I scrolled by the structure gif before I realized it was animating.  Consider lazy loading the animation start as the infographic becomes visible.

But since you asked, I clicked.  And I saw particle.js paired with what appears to be poops, but is probably actually the logo.
No, I don't like the design, but I'm probably not your target demographic.
I clicked "start an atomic swap" or w/e, the app page took an agonizing 10 seconds to load, and is now emitting about a dozen XHR requests per second.
Attempting to send eth/receive bitcoin does not work, as it appears the receiver address JS validator (which apparently uses a different error handler than the input amount validator?) seems to only want to accept TRX addresses.
This feels very much like a proof of concept/hackathon attempt/a bunch of interns working on a side project.

Like any service that sees volume there are some users that have had legit issues, but largely they appear to get resolved.
Some people just like to stir the pot, or get into a twist when their purchase attempts fail &amp; they expect to have their original purchase price locked in instead of a straight refund.  These people should really read the T&amp;C's.
There are also few that take issue with their fee structure or their KYC/AML policies, but that's the cost of doing business.
So it's up to you whether or not to use them, however understand that by doing so you are choosing to play by their rules.
I've been using them for years and I've never had a problem.  Coinbase has always been an easy way to buy bitcoin, in fact for a long time they were the only method available, but there will always be a vocal minority that shits on them.

Okay.  So bitcoin has this thing called the testnet.  It's just like bitcoin, but a test version. 
If you download the full software and put testnet=1 in your config file, that's what you get.
There are things called "faucets" that work on the testnet.  Faucets will give you free testnet coins.  This approach would allow you to experiment with the software without losing real money in case you encounter a learning experience.
You don't have to run the full software.  It might be a good time to educate yourself on the different types of wallets available, and what their features/pros/cons mean to you.

I suppose that is correct from a certain perspective.  But it isn't easy to understand for most everyone.  That makes it less helpful.
Say I am explaining planetary orbital mechanics to somebody who has never even heard of a solar system, or perhaps they have, but they might only have a very basic grasp of concepts such as mass &amp; gravity.  I'm sure I could present them with the raw data and *some* would be able to interpret it, but on average it isn't really going to help a large quantity of people understand *why* the sun rises and sets on a regular schedule, or what's up with those things we call seasons, or why we don't just spin off into space.

A bit is a computer science term for the smallest data unit possible, it cannot be divided further.  Calling 100 satoshi a bit is like telling a carpenter that his chisel is now called a drill press.  
It makes no sense, and to add insult to injury, the pro bit-ers spout off about how words can have different or changing meanings, yet we are talking about something very much rooted in computer science where this term has zero room for subjective interpretation.

Because in the eyes of some it's not the same as buying merchandise from amazon.  
Some see bitcoin as a currency, others as a commodity.  I'm sure there is a group that calls it a precious metal, maybe a few consider it to be like investing in a stock or a bond.
Trades/exchanges of these natures usually require a little more buyer due diligence compared to a simple amazon purchase.

Ease of understanding, I think.  It makes things easier for everybody.
It's not just the eli5's, it's a whole range of different levels of understanding as well as incentive priorities.  Some "get it" more than others, yet some others have found their way into influence without fully understanding the nature of all the options that are on the table.

Perhaps that's the rub.  We present the data from the perspective of science and mathematics, which can offer a bit of information overload to those who might *not* fully understand what they are looking at, for whatever reasons.  What's one spikey graph vs another, to the average bitcoin user or otherwise?
I think simplification, while perhaps being a slightly less accurate portrayal of the tech, might make this sort of thing a little more relatable to everybody.  We ought to be able to tell the story of what is happening on the blockchain using terms that everybody can understand.  Why certain transaction types are more *desirable* than others.  How do more confirmations make it feel *safer*? What constitutes an unconfirmed transaction, and why does it get *uncomfortable* when a significant backlog occurs?
I believe the question should be: how could we offer more easy to understand definitions and/or visuals for understanding these feelings?

Doesn't take much effort to contrast the bugs/hardforks between the two.

It kind of depends what areas of the topic you are interested in, and what level of answers you are looking for.
Not everyone knows everything, and some are better than others at explaining things in accurate, relatable ways, even among core devs.
That said, and at the risk of sounding like a shill, I have high respect for these guys:
* Andreas Antonopoulos
* Gregory Maxwell
* Peter Todd
* Pieter Wuille
* Rusty Russell
* Eric Lombrozo
Edit: added Rusty and Eric.

While I respect your ethos, it is a mystery whenever I find one of you who seems to enjoy difficulty over ease.
We still have lots of work to do.  From my perspective we need to make this sort of thing easier, as expending time and effort on something that *could* be easy is wasteful.
@_date: 2016-11-24 23:10:01

Perhaps you should review the roadmap.
@_date: 2017-01-29 20:22:53
I think OP does understand.
OP has recognized that non-bitcoin entities such as banks that attempt to use blockchain tech are kind of silly for not using the traditional tools available to build internal / privileged systems, of course they have no internal need for it.
And I agree.  I mean hey, they both are getting a little PR for it, even if it's a bit misguided.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:24:04
I guess I should have been more specific.  I should have asked: why invest in a "blockchain tech" which requires trust and has associated counterparty risk?

While I agree fundamentally, I do not believe we should be in some kind of defacto acceptance of this type of behavior just because it is possible.  
Just because a person can do a thing does not mean a person should do that thing.  We should be mindful that some people will indeed do that thing, but to just roll over and claim that people are overreacting is cowardice.

Depends on what kind of game you want to play.  
There are many "only one true coin" zealots that would probably say it's a good idea, and it would certainly *appear* like a good capitalistic choice to maximize ones forked coins.
On the other hand, supporting other coins which offer different characteristics and behaviors is kind of an altruistic hedge (depending on the coin, I suppose.)
Ask yourself: what am I in this for? Might help your decision making process.

The key concept is actually addresses. So long as you segregate your bitcoin movements between separate addresses, they will not be relatable.  This includes later spending, you will want to enforce unspent output controls so they remain unassociated.
Tl;dr: just don't reuse addresses.

I think it makes *some* sense, for example, when dealing with ambiguous dates such as 09/10/11.  It can be confusing, to your point, when US / UK users might interpret the date differently.
Also if you have a list of dates, e.g. filenames with date prefixes, sorting alphanumerically will not correctly order them without using YYYY-MM-DD.

It would also set a nasty precedent.

Estimating what the backlog will do is tricky.   It's currently being leveraged as a political tool by those with money to burn (all these spam transactions) so it really depends how much money they are going to pump in to create an artificially inflated sense of congestion.  You may have heard about some of the "debates" going on in regards to bitcoin lately.
If you used a wallet where you control the private keys you can attempt to sweep the key in question into another wallet and try to spend the output again.   Some wallets even have "abandon transaction" types of features to help with this kind of thing.
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:58:56
If you pay me I'll set you up with what you need.
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:54:12
While technically true, it only works if the miner omits all segwit txes, which would not be feasible for long.

Questions such as the one I replied to, in my opinion, show a fundamental lack of understanding of this technology and why it's important.  At best it's naiveté, at worst it's concern trolling.  Either way it doesn't matter.
Diverting such conversations makes room for more important/current discourse, instead of rehashing an already well discussed topic as a cover to spin an agenda.
And glossing over (ignoring?) the importance of decentralization as well as the risks/implications associated with hardforks shows that you are in the same boat as Lars, confused or being intentionally misleading about bitcoins basic tenets.

It reduces complicated topics to the point where it is misleading.
"The cloud" just means "on hardware that is not your own."
"Execution layer" just means "input based logic."
I can understand how the author might be trying to reach a non technical audience, but in doing so they are doing a disservice to both bitcoin and the audience.

Get a bitcoin wallet.  Something easy like mycelium.  Write down your recovery phrase.  Now write it down again and save it somewhere else.  Always use a pen and paper, never put it into a computer.
Once you are ready, generate a new address. 
Go to  select bitcoin from the data type section, paste in your address in the address field of the content section.  Click download in the output type section.
Put the resulting QR code on the website(s) supporting your game server(s) asking people to kindly donate if they wish.  If they do, the funds will land in your mycelium wallet.

No problem, man!
I see your tx, it's unconfirmed.
You are stuck in the backlog.  In the last few days some person(s) broadcast a shitload of txes, there are still ~45,000 of them waiting to be confirmed, just like yours.
Your tx has a fee of 52 sat/byte, which is bad news for the moment.  According to [21.co]( you need a fee of 181 sat/byte to have a good chance of making the next block.
Don't fret though, you still have some options.  One of them is to wait for the backlog to clear at which point your tx will confirm.  Another is to attempt to send the same money again, with a higher fee.  (You still have this money as your tx has not yet confirmed.)
If I may ask, what wallet software or website did you initiate your transaction from?
Edit: PM me if you would rather keep that quiet.
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:46:43
You can drop ~80 or so characters into OP_RETURN on a TX, but it's unclear if that sort of thing will persist forever, as IIRC OP_RETURN may be pruned in the future.
I think the only way to do it "for sure" is via the UXTO set.

Additional storage mechanisms are available to you too, such as the dwellings of trusted friends or family members.
But at the end of the day it is *you* that must decide what amount of security is appropriate in contrast to the amount of redundancy in your backup solution.

Segwit eliminates [transaction malleability]( which paves the way for a *much* better implementation of lightning.  
Lightning is the killer upgrade most people are looking for.  It's a game changer because if it happens with litecoin, people will be able to see it in action, and the vocal minority currently trying to block progress such as segwit with bitcoin will be left behind.

You should be prepared to wait over an hour for the next block just due to variance alone. Nobody cares why you got into bitcoin, it has always been this way.

The majority of people with tech backgrounds support segwit. It's a no brainer to solve tx malleability.

It's a tweet.
@_date: 2016-09-15 00:27:21
Is this an ad?
@_date: 2016-09-02 15:43:55


Yea.  That's part of what I do for a living.
You need to escape your HTML outputs so the browser does not render/execute nasty things people input.
If your backend is PHP, I would do something like this to your template:
    &lt;center&gt;Posts from: &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;&lt;?php echo htmlentities($username); ?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:00:45
That is still where supply meets demand, just at a specific point in time.
@_date: 2016-09-19 18:55:42
Your post history seems well rounded.

Perhaps you should frame those points in an argument, rather than fishing for them.

You are failing grasp what "backed" means in this context. It is not a synonym for "runs on" or "uses."

He's right though.  Roger got lucky, tried to take over the brand and failed.  That's pretty much all that is noteworthy about him.

It is misleading (and ultimately incorrect) to suggest addresses *can* only be used once, even if if it *suggested* that they *should* be used only once.

Technically true, although there aren't many other reasonable contenders at this point.

That comma placement though.

Of course they are the more toxic of the two. They don't debate with logic or reason, they use hatred and vitriol.  Their lack of technical understanding is supplemented by ignorance.  Their rate limit settings make it easy for their sock puppet accounts to dogpile opposing views while silencing the real discussion.

I don't think any reasonable person believes that Bitcoin, on its own, will ever become a currency.  It's too important, too valuable.

Brilliant! Most of the rest of the site uses fuzzy time, and you are right, consistency is important.


You're halfway there.  The other half is that they have the fewest sides, so from a sum-of-all-polygons-on-screen perspective it was an easy trade off.  
Most of snapchain has involved me honing my skills against some of the newer tech these days, I'm planning on pitching a larger concept project as this is becoming a working example prototype, which will hopefully lend some illumination on the core concepts.

Just take a selfie with a landmark in the background, upload it to a file sharing site, include the URL, GPS coordinates, and the date the photo was taken.

If mass distribution is what you're after then you can script it.

* 2) Generate a bunch of address and private key pairs (it would be best for the actual recipients to generate these on their own)
* 3) Distribute your bitcoin to the addresses

@_date: 2016-10-03 16:37:13
I feel like you might want to add a caveat for older, non HD wallets, which initially compute a certain quantity of addresses/private keys for use. I think it was like 50?
These pairs will work if you copy the wallet to another machine, but once you exhaust the initial set additional entropy is used to compute new ones, at which point the copies would diverge.

NAS performance may vary by your network/raid config, but yes you can totally do that.

I am attempting to use this type of approach on a social site, along with restricting participation with random lottery/proof of work, where PoW involves moderating/validating incoming content.  Throw consensus on top and I think I can solve the troll/voice problem in a significant way.

If I recall correctly, the original reddit admins did something similar to generate popularity initially?
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:53:47
Andreas explains this in the video better than I can, but I'll try.
The shorter the chip life the less time they have to be effective, so a miner with cheap electricity will buy them in bulk to use to mine immediately. 
As chip lifetime gets longer more economic factors will come into play, for example variable cost of electricity or government involvement.
Also, as I understand it, the only way to buy new mining units these days is, at minimum, one shipping containers worth.  This doesn't make sense for you or me, nor would it for a reseller with such chip lifespans, they would never sell them all before they became obsolete.  It only makes sense for large scale miners to buy them currently.
Once the shelf life spans a couple years, a reseller could buy in bulk and sell to individuals.

Hey man, I've seen you knocking people more than once recently over bitcoin related integration or wallet management, I think you could stand to lighten up a bit.
OP - It's locked up because it's re-scanning.  When you add a new key, the software needs to determine if there are unspent outputs (among other things) to consider, and that takes a while to process across the whole blockchain.
Check out the docs on the importprivkey command, you can pass rescan=false in to the method and it should return quickly, although related local balances will be stale.  This approach is useful if you wanted to script an import a bunch of keys at at once, just don't forget to do a rescan when your key imports are complete to get the balances in sync.

Bitpay and Coinbase have a ton of information on you (not to mention access to your bank account) in the case that you execute a double spend, they can just pass it along to LEO.  
Will your restaurant also require that information to use bitcoin?

Right.  Got a signature we can verify?
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:11:35

@_date: 2016-07-20 18:58:31
750 -&gt; 950.

I didn't answer all your questions. 
Yes I save blocks and tx data for use in the explorer, I use Cassandra.
It also pushes updates for new blocks, chart data, and other notifications from nodejs/websockets.
It's been a fun project.

Just in case you were curious on these topics:
The replace by fee feature is mostly geared to your use case, the fee was too low to get your transaction accepted, you can "replace" it with a higher one. [Read more about it here.](
"Sweeping" the key just means you export the key(s) to which your unspent output(s) (aka your coins) belong to into a different wallet. The new wallet will allow you to use the outputs because it has no memory of the transaction that isn't going through.

* Proof of work: moderating and classifying incoming content.   
* Consensus: Multiple moderations on each new piece of content, which must agree if it is to be considered "true."  
* Blocks and blockchains: If it doesn't pass consensus, it doesn't get included in data storage.  It does not become public or published.  
* Token scarcity: we can't all speak at once.   Participation tokens are "use or lose" until the next block.
* Random lottery: We can reward those who do work backed by consensus, or those who contribute accepted content.   
I believe these concepts can be applied to a social platform.

Some people use tools like vanitygen to generate a message in addresses, then spend some satoshis on them.  The UXTO set becomes your storage mechanism, which is less likely to be purged by contrast to OP_RETURN.
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:26:51


Actually, these have value.  They are the basis for which the random lottery gets evenly scattered across sections of hashrate.


Quite astute, this is one of the issues.  Similarly, a lower orphan rate means you can accept fewer confirmations, as there is less of a risk that you would be associated with an invalid chain.

I see it as a symptom of excess hashrate before a difficulty retarget.  Too much hashrate, more blocks, means more probability of orphans.  It's not *because* of the orphans that difficulty increases, they are a byproduct of the hashrate growing too fast.

Ah, I think I see what is happening.  You appear to be attempting to play both sides of the same fence.  I don't think it will work. :)

Then you really need to have a good offsite backup strategy.

Good luck.

Good eye.  Or mine sucks.  Either way, it is not nearly an impressive figure as the 140k *bitcoin* my brain initially thought.
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:38:32
I guess it depends on your level of technical expertise, but I keep an eye on the [bitcoin-dev mailing list](

Because they are here to "fix" Bitcoin, and nobody around here puts up with that brand of bullshit.

You are disagreeing over the same truth.

No mention of bitcoin or a startup in the article.

I think you mean Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:48:22
I didn't realize you could buy bitcoin or litecoin using a checking account or debit card from PayPal/transfer it to a wallet you control. 
What are their fees like?

Thank you.

Why in the world would you use a device that did not have a backup?  Literally playing with fire.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:44:49
Plenty of room at the table, bro.
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:30:27
Whatever. Gemini accused me of theft and attempted to extort me.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:10:32
Then don't use it.

Only way to beat the trolls and the morons.

Cool man. But I'm not banned from anywhere nor are my posts moderated.  You guys call it censorship here.  Go figure.

These "hunts" are so scammy.
@_date: 2016-07-24 15:05:57
The trolls were/are pushing for a block size decrease.
Trolls involved in rationalizing transaction censorship.

His ideas are not always practical/reasonable though.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:14:57
If I'm understanding you correctly, you are suggesting that illiterate users should adopt something like bitcoin en masse?
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:55:01
Use your backup drive?

Long concern still concern troll. Use it or do not.
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:44:50
I think it's just as idiotic as calling a unit of measure, which can be further divided, a *bit*.
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:16:03
Agree to disagree, friend. I have been working at it.  My platform is troll proof and idiot proof. The signal to noise ratio will be better than anything to date. And it is thanks to the the new concepts bitcoin brings to the table that I was able to execute.
Watch for me this fall.
@_date: 2017-06-24 01:03:10
Absolutely nothing.  I believe "they" will continue to "jerk around" "anybody who will fall for it."
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:51:18
OP, if you don't have a proper backup strategy, you shouldn't be playing with crypto currency in the first place.  
Friends, family, and christmas have nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:09:55


If I am curt with you it's because your "opinions" are a dime a dozen on these "forums."  People such as yourself add no value or insight.  You are either lazy, or just want to hear yourself speak.


See above.


Not in the slightest.  You are "covering" topics that have been well discussed for years now.  My advice: go read some history and become enlightened.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:11:55
Okay, this was my pm:
Forgive the condensed reply version, on mobile at breakfast. From my perspective, Ethereum is dangerous. It has several liabilities that preclude me from investing in it. It is a Turing complete blockchain. We have already seen lots of examples of how this can go wrong, from draining the dao (users misinterpreted the way their contract was designed) to DoS issues at the node level, because its other users' software. Terrifying from a security perspective. Then there is vitalik, the one man who controls all. He can rollback changes (or influence the decision to) in a tech that was supposed to be immutable. Finally, the recent ico's are nothing more than credit schemes, they will not pay out long term to you or me. Those schemes have already failed, and blockchain tech won't change that.
Ver has been pushing eth because he knows he can't control bitcoin. Or he is hedging his bets. Either way, it is the capitol of Ver and those like him currently propping up eth with these icos, but it has no defined value the way bitcoin does. He won't last, if he doesn't change his attitude.
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:51:07
A low orphan rate is desirable.  Orphaned blocks represent wasted work, from the Proof of Work perspective.  They expend hashrate, electricity, block rewards, and uptime of machines that don't last very long in the ASIC space race that we are currently experiencing.

In the agreements and other lies being pushed as reality. Segwit2x for example. Signalling to signal. Give me a fucking break.
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:53:29
My point was that there is still bitcoin being transacted when I use my shift card.

Similar to this one actually. NFCU. Gemini could not verify checking account. Savings account worked. Bought btc, NFCU rejected the ACH tx, but gemini credited my btc balance. Then said I withdrew that btc and owed them.  Never withdrew anything, but 3 tiers of customer support later they agreed I owed them nothing and allowed me to close my account.  Would not recommend.

I'm sorry, I see this one a lot spouting the usual crap.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:23:16
I tried this once.  I got my genesis block setup with a cheeky message, and then I had to purge all the bitcoin seed related stuff.  Then mining worked.  I was the only one, however; made a fortune in monopoly money.
The real issue with your idea is in fact mining.  It cannot be the same as bitcoin.  It would be far too easy to point asics at bitcoin2 to take control via 51%.

This is an important bit though, it is not *worth* anything because it's orphaned.  It matched the criteria as you point out, but it is still a waste of energy.
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:22:38
Maybe go back to dogecoin.
