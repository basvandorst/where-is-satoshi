No it won't. Via second layer solutions like the Lightning Network and compression of the data one transaction on the main chain will consist of thousands of transactions batched together and the fee will be split over all those transactions. That way even a 1Sat = 100$ price won't be a problem.

I honestly would rather see steady and slow growth up to 1 Million so that we hit it in 2025 or so. That way there would be enough time to deal with technical/scaling problems that show up along the way.

yeah we broke the resistance that held us up for the last 5 days. Now it is probably going to accelerate to the downside with short term target at 7500.

I really would need a good introduction video in German. A lot of people that i want to intorduce to Bitcoin are just not good enough in english that they would understand a english introduction video:/

Ever heard of automated stop loses ? I can sleep very well with that in place knowing that i won't lose money if bitcoin decides to go crazy. The worst way my trades can end is in a 0 sum game or with really small loses i can easily recover from.

I agree anybody who activly trades more than 20% of his assets is insane. first and formost you should invest and daytrading with a portion of that is done to increase your overall Investment

He is talking about the flag pennant that is forming on the 1h. But i also think a Bart is more likely.

Honest opinion ? Atleast 5k i don't think we will see the bottom above that.

Because it didn't. The day it did hit the top started at 19187$ and the Top was 19660$ the day ended on 18953$. The day before that it started at 17477$ and the high of the day was 19377$. The day with the most extrem price rise was the 7th of december when the price started at 13623$ and the high was at 16615$. That 2992$ was the most extrem price rise in one day in Bitcoin history. (Data is extracted from Bitstamp the prices on other exchanges might vary a bit)

Very awesome App. Thanks for creating it i already can see myself sinking far too much time into this.

I hope you did not sell all you have. Never trade with more than 20% of your bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:23:00
your 6700 is a very good position to enter a bearish trade imo and yes wanting the bitcoin price to go down is a very strange feeling but just differentiate here. You want the price to go down for your trade to work out but also to build up for good point where the price trend can reverse.

There is allways a bigger fish. There is allways going to be a larger bull run about to come up 
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:44:34
I really hope you are right

We are on the first day of a 1-4 Candle correction. Probably up to max 7800. Then it is very likely to fall again atleast to 5k before we really bounce to new ATH. This right now is most likely a dead cat bounce.

Good that there are countries in the world where education is not a privilege for the rich like in the US . In germany for example no university student has to live with a debt after they graduate.

Well the thing is (Yes downvote me all if you want) many people here just do not understand how markets work.
They think TA is bullshit and blame whales for manipulating the price every time it drops. The drop we see right now is just natural market movement. Remember 2013 Price droped from 1200 to 200 and could not get up again until 2015.
Right now the weekly chart is showing extremly bearish signals and we are up for another 4 weeks of going down. But eventually everything is going to line up, we are going to hit a resistance line and we are going to go up again. If you want to know we have one at 5k, 3900 and 1300.
These drops and then rises are just something you have to be able to deal with if you are trading bitcoin.
The fact that bitcoin does not give a fuck about bad news does also mean it does not give a fuck about good news  (i am speaking of long term development the China ban was not able to crash it for long just as the G20 news were not able to bounce it for long) .
Or that it is not bound to things like a huge company or backed by a goverment. Long term this is good and will lead to bitcoins success but short term it is one of the reasons we have so much volatility. 
I am a bitcoin long term believer but in the shortterm there is just nothing bullish to be seen in the bitcoin price. 
Now you can downvote me and tell me how wrong i am in the meantime i am going to trade and increase my bitcoin stash just how i did very succsesfully since the beginning of the year. 
Edit: it is very well possible that those 4 weeks of downside transform into another 7 months but nothing is ever writen in stone. Allways keep an eye open on the price and re evaluate your trading strategy acordingly
