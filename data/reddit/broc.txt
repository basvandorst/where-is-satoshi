Paper wallets are intended for "cold storage". This means that they are offline and not intended to be used for regular transactions. The alternative is to use "hot wallets"; software or hardware wallets used to transact as and when you need. They take care of the change addresses for you as well as providing the security so that your private key isn't broadcast (obviously, there are limitations here).
The addresses are irrelevant. It is the wallet capability we are concerned with. Hardware and software wallets are capable of creating more addresses based on your seed. (the seed is essentially a user-specific passphrase from which public and private key pairs are generated and it is this which allows you to backup your wallet and recreate it if necessary with all coin-containing addresses intact).
Clearly, a paper wallet has no address generating capability (it's a piece of paper or rather a single address contained on a piece of paper) hence it must be swept of the entire funds.

You can keep receiving to the same address with no issues. It's the spending where things get tricky. If you're not spending, no issue. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:10:25
When you spend money from a wallet, the entire amount leaves the address. The amount you want to actually transact goes to the address you want it sent to whereas the rest goes to a "change" address.
In the case of software and hardware wallets, this change address is automatically generated and linked to your wallet so that you still see this change (which you can spend in future). You would not be aware that "change" was created and linked to your wallet.
In the case of a paper wallet, a change address cannot be created and linked to your wallet as there is only one address. Therefore, any change is considered lost.
Paper wallets should always be swept. This means the entire amount should be transacted.  This is what the warning was in reference to. 
There is also some risk from public key exposure after each use but that's relevant to all addresses and not yet a real risk. Private key exposure (necessary for spending) is also a risk eg from malicious software when scanning your private key.

Glad to help. More research is definitely advised. re: change addresses, look into inputs and outputs. In essence, every input is regarded as needing an equal output. 
So, for example, if you receive 1BTC but want to spend 0.25BTC of that there has to be an output of 1BTC from which that 0.25BTC is spent. The rest goes to a change address. 
The best way to think of it is as though every input is equivalent to a cash note or coin. It can't be split - only spent, and the change returned. I hope that helps without confusing things. 
Cold storage is a great idea but makes things difficult if/when you want to remove any forked coins. Another thing to think about.

To answer your question though, it will require some effort on your part. You will need to register with an exchange and prove that you are who you say you are (this is because of the fact that your government-backed money will be used to purchase bitcoin) with ID (passport/licence). 
Once the cash is in your exchange account, you purchase bitcoin. Once you're happy with the new price, you sell the bitcoin. Buying/selling is based on the current market price (you can set limits eg if you only want to sell at $20,000) and there will hopefully be buyers willing to buy from you when you want to sell. 
Once that fiat (government backed) currency is back in your exchange account (from the sale) you send it to your bank account and use it as normal. 
So...to answer your question, it's not too hard but it requires some effort on your part. 
The reason I said I'm not sure bitcoin is for you is because using/storing/selling will require a bit of research around security. I would worry that you purchase it and don't secure your private keys and/or leave it on the exchange where it is more susceptible to online attacks. Food for thought.

Clearly the bitcoin (the "what I've bought" you refer to) can't be bought again but is designed with the capacity to be sold on (bitcoin is fungible). 
I think what you mean to ask is
 "does this mean that the *wallet* is locked down and I can't buy/sell from it again?" 
The answer to this is "no". You can buy/sell from that address as often as you like.
 **HOWEVER** once you've sent to this wallet, it's address is compromised. As long as you keep the private key private, you're fine. Once you've sent *from* this address, your private key is compromised and if you re-use it, your BTC will get stolen. 
Ideally you should only use an address once (even when receiving funds) though some may think that this is unnecessarily cautious.

Kim Jong-il was Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:16:16
I don't know why people responding have complicated matters. 
1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshi
Op is simply suggesting that Satoshi becomes the new denomination for Bitcoin but has erroneously compared it to stock splitting. There is no *splitting* of anything required. 
If you own 1 BTC you own 100,000,000 Satoshi
In the future, when we all live on the moon, 1 BTC = 1,000,000 dollars
Therefore, 1,000,000 Dollars = 100,000,000,000,000 Satoshi
Therefore 1 Dollar = 0.000,000,1 BTC = 100 Satoshi 
Op is saying "why wait? Let's start saying 1 dollar = 9,000 Satoshi right now. More than anything, psychologically buying thousands of Satoshi will be easier than buying thousand**th**s of a bitcoin".

Think of the blockchain as a tradition ledger (a big notepad where credits and debits are written down). You are owed 1 coin by me and this is written in the ledger by the local accountant. Imagine that someone came up to this accountant and said 'hmmm...I see what you're doing, but I could do it better' they then take that same ledger *with all of the existing credits and debits* and copy it but use their own methods to make note of credits and debits going forward. 
What this means, in terms of the blockchain, is that there is an existing ledger (Bitcoin) and now new ledgers (Bcash and Bitcoin Gold) which do things differently in some ways. As these are based on the existing, original, ledger pre-existing credits/debits have to be honoured. Hence, any coins you had on the old ledger are also there in these other ledgers so you now have 1 coin on each ledger. 
So...you have credits in these three ledgers. What you do with each of them (eg sell one to buy more of the other or otherwise just hodl each of them) is up to you. Bear in mind that each of these coins have a different perceived value so you can't buy/sell them for equal quantities. You have to understand that they are now completely different coins.
Does that help to clarify?

I've been doing my research around this and my conclusion is basically that the ledger is cheaper than the original Trezor and therefore more justifiable for most. It also has the bonus of more altcoin support out of the box and a lot of people love the sleeker looks. The stainless steel outer is also a bonus. 
It sounds as though both are well supported with the Trezor coming out on top due to stellar customer service and frequency of updates. 
With the Trezor T, it's hard to say as there are no actual reviews yet (understandably) but most people are miffed about the (much) higher cost for what is ostensibly a big touch screen. I have no doubt that there is a lot more going on under the hood too - there just haven't been any reviews yet. 
So...you're seeing lots of nanos as they seem to be more common (more easily available too, I understand). 
Personally, I'm waiting for the T but didn't manage to pre-order. If you decide you want to go for the ledger instead, I'm sure someone (me included) would happily take the T off your hands (decide before you open the packaging though - it'll be a lot harder to sell on otherwise).

We all know that Amazon has incredible customer service. One of the reasons I love buying from them is that it's so reassuring; knowing that if anything ever goes wrong with a product, I can return/exchange it with minimal fuss. 
Let's assume that Amazon accepts bitcoin. How would they deal with exchanges/refunds then? I know that this has been discussed in previous threads but I don't feel that the responses I read were adequate. They certainly wouldn't persuade me to accept bitcoin as a retailer. 
What if refunds are given in fiat? Then what's the point? Both for the merchant who would have to pay exchange fees etc and for the customer who wants his bitcoin back. Bitcoin will never become a true currency if it's used in this way. I'm sure exchanging fiat for bitcoin will only become easier but it'll still never be as easy as just using fiat in the first place. 
Basically, there are a number of scenarios I can imagine if Amazon were to accept bitcoin. 1) Refunds/returns are made in fiat. This is a hassle for everyone but will mean that you get back the price you would have paid in fiat. What if the price of bitcoin was high when you bought but is now low? You would end up getting back more fiat returning your item than if you were to sell your bitcoin. Could this be exploited? 2) Refunds are made in BTC. This would necessitate Amazon retaining a BTC wallet purely for the processing of refunds (rather than immediately converting to fiat). I think that this could work and would negate the transaction/exchange fees. It would also be more likely to give bitcoin the real push it needs to become a true currency. Obviously, Amazon would have their own issues with this (is it even viable to keep some funds in BTC or too much of a risk?), but the main issue I see, considering the volatility of Bitcoin, again is that customer service is exploited. What would stop me from returning an item I bought a week ago because the price of BTC has suddenly sky-rocketed and I know that techinically I'll get back double what I originally paid? 
I'm sure that there is a reasonable way around this. I just can't see it with the current state of bitcoin. Maybe Amazon wouldn't care and would be willing to keep a BTC wallet and to process refunds in BTC without changing their policies just because they can afford to. I'm sure bitcoin usage would be a tiny fraction of their business (to begin with) and this could be monitored and stepped up as required. Or maybe they'll keep the BTC wallet but make their refund policy more strict (just for bitcoin users, maybe?). 
Personally, I currently see bitcoin being used for products/services that can't be refunded or at least are unlikely to be. Eg restaurants, bars, bills, some forms of entertainment. It'll need to prove itself in other avenues before major retailers become willing to bear so much risk. 
Thoughts? Anyone envisage other scenarios or solutions?

"We continue to believe there is a meaningful probability Bitcoin (the specific currency/conduit) may not succeed, but this will most likely be a result of the emergence of a better crypto currency. We believe alternative currencies will continue to emerge, though none of the current batch appears to be superior enough to overcome the substantial head start for Bitcoin. As with any new disruptive technology, we would expect the new powerful technology to continue to be utilized for nefarious purposes. We also believe that given the early stages of development and revolutionary technology, weaknesses will continue to be identified and at times exploited."

He's not computer savvy but wants some magic internet money? Do him a favour - tell him to figure out how to get the public/private keys himself. If he doesn't, you keep the BTC.
I'm totally serious. You would be doing him a favour by encouraging him to educate himself. The whole point of bitcoin is that that we are in control. This means that he needs to be responsible and figure things out for himself. Otherwise, what happens if he loses his paper wallet? Or doesn't configure 2FA? Or shows someone his private key? Will he come running to you? Guide him, but let him know that he needs to take total responsibility. 
To be honest, it was probably a mistake you getting the BTC for him in the first place (assuming he asked you to get it for him and it's not a gift). I don't mean to be an asshole, just that if someone is that interested, and wants to get on board, they should go through the whole process and take full responsibility. Your role, as his friend, would be to enable through education.

Nothing, I'd imagine. Do tax authorities always check that the transaction is legit from both the buyer and seller points of view? Depends on what's being bought/sold, cost and whether or not there's an obvious reason for authorities to check up. No doubt there is a risk but I'd imagine for the most part nothing would happen. 
The seller is declaring their income, it would be expected that the buyer declared theirs (eg income for the non self-employed is taxed at source).

Because the private key will have been exposed to a 3rd party app / the internet in order to spend the bitcoin. It should therefore no longer be considered private.

Now that's a great idea. That way, the retailer is not exposed to any risk and also has more of an incentive to transact with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 10:58:46
Personally, I think it will rise steadily for a short while. All of the recent news regarding startups, fund launches, general perception and rumours/hints re: Netflix, paypal etc have really helped prove Bitcoin's resilience post-China bubble. 
Of course, anything could happen, at any point to cause another crash too. That's why this is all speculation. 
All things being equal, if there's no huge sell-off or other news that could negatively impact the price, it'll continue to rise. Which is a bit of a nonsense statement as I'm basically saying it'll continue to rise if it doesn't fall!
Ah fuck it. I agree with @_date: 2014-01-06 15:25:39
You've got issues.
@_date: 2014-01-06 11:09:18
Do you always pay the fee? It's more likely to be delayed when there is no fee payable.
@_date: 2014-01-12 13:40:19
So you expect governments to welcome Bitcoin usage and not take a cut?
If they're taxing it, they're not against it. Means retailers and other services are more likely to embrace it as the government is not suddenly going to pipe up that Bitcoin is illegal. 
Are you saying that you would expect people to be able to use it legitimately without paying tax and other dues? You expect Bitcoin to become a real threat to fiat and all of the industries built up around the usage of said fiat to, what, just disappear? 
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:01:37
What? Why? 
What are we 'arguing' over? Whether or not taxation of bitcoin makes it desirable? 
Of course taxation of any income is undesirable. Who wants to 'lose' money to the government? However, the only way it wouldn't be taxed is if it had remained a 'blackmarket' currency for potentially nefarious transactions (silk road). 
If we want it to become more popular with 'the masses', potentially challenging fiat, then taxation is hugely desirable. It means that the governments have embraced it. 
If we want it to grow and become a true, legitimate currency, we need governments to accept it and regulate it. Without that, there would be no mass uptake. And there's no way it would be allowed to grow without the governments taking their cut. 
You want to be able to transact in Bitcoin freely without being taxed. That's just not realisitic. What would happen if everyone did that? Taxes wouldn't get paid, national services would just stop functioning. 
So, I guess it depends on what you want from bitcion. 
If I came across as a douchebag, I'm sorry. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:21:59
How are people buying and selling in a timely manner?
a) Leaving fiat and bitcoin in the exchange account until you need to use it
b) Transferring the bitcoin into the exchange only when needed, otherwise storing it elsewhere. Fiat is left in the exchange account. 
c) Transferring in/out of the exchange account, both bitcoin and fiat, only when it is going to be exchanged. 
I hear a lot of stories re: leaving bitcoin in an exchange for extended periods and how dangerous it is, but is this the case for fiat too? 
Anyone know of issues where fiat was removed (without conversion to bitcoin) from any exchange?
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:11:27


OP explained that it wouldn't affect the outcome. ie all clues were still relevant except for the **last step**. They also gave the clue "-1" in reference to this. (Personally, I think this means that the clue "+1" is now negated). ie no one's time would have been wasted.

If you were to change the BTC back to fiat then you would be liable for tax as decreed by current law.
If you kept the BTC and spent it as BTC, then there's currently no way this would be known/assessed by authorities. 
New laws will no doubt be written to account for crypto-currencies and assets. Whether or not these would/could be applied retrospectively - who knows? We're entering a whole new era here. Don't forget your towel, it's going to get messy...
@_date: 2014-06-26 08:09:45

@_date: 2014-06-26 04:44:52
Ah right. Yes. Agreed.
@_date: 2014-06-26 03:54:39
Oh sure, a veritable Pandora's box could be opened but with BTC I think it's not that likely (again, this is with the current state of laws not yet applicable to cryptocurrencies). 
How would they know how many BTC wallets you have? If you had to declare where your fiat has gone, how would they know what price you purchased the BTC at and through what medium? 
It's currently very murky and so only a matter of time until the correct laws and procedures are defined.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:18:52
Yeah. This definitely needs to become easier and safer before people can really start getting into Bitcoin.
As soon as you have to start explaining to someone who wouldn't typically use Bitcoin why it's important for them to keep their private key to themselves, you've essentially lost them. This will remain an issue for cryptocurrencies until a 3rd party comes up with a solution. I've no doubt this will happen at some point, but until then Bitcoin is staying out of the mainstream.  
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:50:18
An. An anarchist. To be honest, I thought as much from your original post, I just wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt.
You were expecting bitcoin to become some sort of subversive, underground financial WMD? Stick it to the man by cultivating a powerful global cabal of like-minded individuals who could take down the financial system so ingrained in society by insidiously wielding Bitcoin like some kind of virus? Rotting it from the inside?

**I typed this in response to a reply from you which you've since deleted:**


Me too. And I appreciate you keeping it civil.


I don’t know. What I do know, however, is that someone smarter than us will develop a way to do it. The whole financial industry is built on such unfathomable concepts.


I know you’ve heard this argument a million times but your transactions aren’t settled as quickly as you think they are. Day-to-day this makes no difference to you but what about the big stuff? Or how about the other people in the world who live in countries with less reliable banking services?


What if your closest ATM isn't working? What if you need to withdraw more than £200 (whatever dollar equivalent) and the bank is closed? What if your banking app is down? Your card is stolen? Have you always had cash on you when you needed it? I'd be willing to bet that you have your phone in you far more often than you have cash on you.


You could have as many decoy wallets as you wanted - your true wealth need never be known. 
Besides, are you arguing that it would be easier to steal private keys than *cash?*


I'm about four cask strength whiskies in myself.
No need to revisit. You've heard/read it all before so I'm not telling you anything new. I'll just tell you that I've been in BTC since early 2013 and have seen many highs and many lows and this time is unlikely to be any different. I know that it seems to be failing to you but it really isn't. In fact, if you think about its scope it is already *incredibly* successful and that success will keep building. I just hope you won't look back one day and think "damn, I should have bought some bitcoin when it was only a few K" and beat yourself up about it.
@_date: 2019-11-18 12:55:11

And that's fine. If you're happy with the status quo, so be it.
The fact is though, you're denouncing something that you don't even understand the fundamentals of. Ergo, do you really prefer what you have to what cryptocurrency offers or do you prefer what you have to what you *think* it offers? 
Either way, it doesn't matter. You do you. Just don't post uninformed comments on a subreddit about a subject you know nothing about.

Then you should really know by now that transactions are verified on the blockchain and therefore what happens to the hardware wallet is irrelevant as long as you have adequate opsec. 


You see this as a bad thing but what happens if that bank you trust (hope the irony isn't lost on you post-2008) fails? With bitcoin there doesn't need to be a single point of failure. You can *always* have access to your money. Again, you already know this, right?

I’m a Brit. I sure as hell didn’t use USD when I went to Sulawesi a couple of years ago and I wouldn’t have been able to use GBP either. Guess what though - pretty much everyone I met had a mobile phone. 
And why do you think the whole world *can’t* use bitcoin? Who says it *has* to replace fiat? Why can’t they co-exist?


Because a) we all walk around with our private keys on us; b) cash can’t be stolen more easily and c) more sophisticated storage options are obviously not going to be developed.


How long exactly has the FSCS (or FDIC in the USA) been around? Regardless, you really don’t think it’s possible that services could spring up to offer something similar for bitcoin?


It’s not a problem, it’s an attempt to illicit some lateral thinking from you. 
Fiat is *not* digital and doesn’t work as such no matter what the fancy UI of your banking app has fooled you into thinking. If you don’t see the benefit of a digital, instantly-settled asset then that’s on you.
As for your point about cash “always” being accessible due to its physical nature; that doesn’t even make any sense. I hope you realise that.


Not really sure what your point is here but it was very well made.

@_date: 2019-11-18 13:07:50


When it comes to bitcoin, no one "needs" to convince anyone of anything. Don't use it.


What am "I" or "we" doing wrong?
In case you didn't know this, there is no marketing team for bitcoin just as there is no CEO. I see that you struggle to grasp the fundamentals of bitcoin and that's OK but no one is going to hold your hand and pull you in. This is all part and parcel of having independent financial sovereignty as well as part of the risk.
One day, perhaps in another 10 years, someone will make it easier for you by creating the company or app that removes the sovereignty that you're so afraid of. Perhaps then you'll finally accept it's role in this world. Or you won't. Nobody cares enough to make you. And I mean this in the best possible way. *You* are in control.

And so thought many people back in 2011, 2012, 2013 etc. 


Every country has corrupt politicians ergo bitcoin must surely "be good" for   every country.


The ledger has always been publicly accessible, nothing has changed there. Bitcoin is as private as you want to make it. As for other cryptocurrencies, there are completely private alternatives but bitcoin will be receiving some privacy upgrades soon enough.


If you somehow link your details to your bitcoin public key, then sure. Surely you see that this is obviously less traceable than a traditional bank account though?


Yup. We don't need to depend on anyone but ourselves for complete control over our finances.


Have we? How?


Is this actually true? If so, wouldn't this 1% want it to prosper? Also, you think that fiat isn't controlled by an even smaller minority?

Is this a serious question? It could be Soros, Buffet, Tim Draper, a conglomerate, Institutional Investors, a syndicate, a group of syndicates, your neighbour who is richer than you think, parents who've been persuaded by their kids, kids who've been saving up...
As an example, in my circle of friends I **was** the only one with bitcoin and am still the go-to guy regarding cryptocurrencies. I have a bunch who were ready to buy in at around 15K (on the way down) and got nervous. They're not going anywhere. And before you start cracking jokes about my friends being all high school kids, I'm a late-thirties former med schooler who turned banker, now retired.


They should, but they're nervous. They're waiting to make sure it rises again - hence the term "FOMO".


This is exactly the kind of thing people have been saying about the price since it was around $1. As you say, you've been in the game for a year. You're opinion, as valued as it is (no /s intended), would probably be very different if you'd seen more than just one of these pumps.
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:29:02
I for one agree with you. There is a lot of pressure building due to the positive news over the year or so. Additionally, the fact that bitcoin has not been and *cannot* be stopped is in itself the best news of all. People on the sidelines did not expect "virtual currency" to become legit and we've gotten way past the stage that it could be possible for anyone to even *consider* stopping it.
I know that there are plenty of redditors who are reading this and shaking their heads but consider this: I am not saying that hyperbitcoinisation will happen overnight but it very possibly might. At that point, do you want to be holding some Bitcoin or not?

I agree with your sentiments. However, the only thing I think this "crash" will do is scare off those who bought high and sold low. Most of these people got/are going to get badly burned and will probably never buy back in. Newbies coming in post-"crash" of 2018 will just go through the same pains. Rinse and repeat all the way up to the moon.
In the longer term I don't think this "crash" is going to change much of the market. The more serious shitcoins are just going to ride through the turbulence and live to scam another day.
I guess we're both here longterm though so we'll  find out soon enough.

There's a lot of confusion here.
Every *transaction* is potentially taxable. This means exchanging from one currency to another (including other cryptocurrencies). Simply transferring your coins to various addresses/wallets is not considered a transaction.
I use the word "potentially" above because it depends on your net gain (gross gain minus original cost and any fees incurred) and allowances for the tax year (if relevant).

1) "encourages address reuse"
You can generate as many as you like. If you're unwilling to do that, I'd wager any method of storing your coins will provide stumbling blocks
2) "handling of raw private keys"
How is this a flaw? Because you might destroy your private keys according to the page you linked
3) "Centralised validation"
Constantly checking addresses on a block explorer is apparently a privacy issue. 
4) "change addresses"
Not understanding how bitcoin works is now a paper wallet flaw.
5) "Java script browser"
The addresses are to be generated offline. Apparently now doing this is a paper wallet flaw.
All of these seem to be user issues as opposed to paper wallet issues.

There are a bunch of other exchanges which don't require KYC. eg coinex.  Check forkdrop.io for a comprehensive list. In fact, for "just" 0.1 BTC you should be fine with quite a few exchanges.
Your best option in terms of anonymity is BISQ but there may be a bit of a learning curve for you. Localbitcoins or similar could also work but require physical trading. Not sure how you feel about that.

If you were speaking with the service provider directly, and *they* were being vague, then your assumption about it being a scam of some sort is probably correct. If it was someone that had just *used* the service then they likely were just ignorant of the methods.
The services I’m speaking of make it very clear that they use brute forcing techniques. They rely on reputation (and of course technical know how, computing power etc) to get them custom.
Let’s hope neither of us ever need these services!

You literally cannot lose your money, with BTC. You lose the keys for it, or you send it to the wrong address (not by accident, but due to scamming etc). It's always there until it is moved.
Physical cash can be lost easily. Currency controlled online (bank apps etc) is not really there and accounts can be closed/frozen.

Can I ask why you though this? Is it because of the terminology ie 1 Bitcoin = $x
Remember, bitcoin is a currency. Just like when you go on holiday and exchange, for example, Dollars for Baht you will not necessarily get whole Baht in return. It would depend on the exchange rate. Eg for your $100 you would get 3,312 Baht. The money exchange isn't going to turn around and say, "well, I can only give you 3000 Baht so that's $90 please". 
These aren't stocks or shares where you need to own a whole one. You can buy as much bitcoin as you want.
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:43:10
I had a similar experience. 
I first told my friends/colleagues about bitcoin shortly after I got into it. They mocked me/it quite hard. 
A little while later, a lot of these same friends and colleagues stopped mocking me and asked how they could get some. Then there was a crash and most stopped asking as "BTC was finished". They still wished they'd purchased when I had, however. 
A little while later, it peaked again and crashed again. Some bought, most didn't. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. 
Suffice to say, those who know that I bought BTC back then certainly don't mock me anymore. The price will continue to rise and drop and people will continue to look for reasons not to buy. The only thing you can be sure of is that those people who know you purchased when you did will stop mocking you and wish they had bought when you did. HODL.

Come one man, this is a survey by Kaspersky, an *internet security company*. On top of this, the sample size is 13,434. And you think that this is representative of *the world*?

I convinced him to show me how bitcoin worked by sending me 3 different lots of BTC.
There was a shocking number of responders stating that he just sounded like a nice guy that *I* scammed.

You're right! I hadn't even considered that. 
With fiat I'd never have been able to turn the tables on him for the following reasons: 
1) Having him send me funds would have exposed his real details
2) He's in a different country so would have had to wire the money internationally which would have meant greater fees. Immediately off-putting for him.
3) The whole process would have taken days which we would have given the victim (me, in this case) to question everything. Obviously he'd want to pull it off more quickly. ^((That's what she said))

@_date: 2019-12-06 08:13:51
These can be legit and rely on brute forcing *if a large enough portion of the seed or password is known*. Eg Dave's walletrecoveryservices. No scam here. 20% (not 10%) of the *recovered* amount is kept. Granted, the service relies on your trust that they will then return the other 80% but the one I've mentioned has a tonne of positive feedback on Reddit.
You or the commenter you were responding to must have misunderstood the extent of the service and/or the claims regarding recovery. Or it was just a scam in this case.

To be clear, phishing involves the users being duped into thinking they are dealing with legitimate websites/services and inputting their security information.

@_date: 2019-12-18 14:45:51
I'm so sorry! I thought that there were two different people in this thread (not including me).
Wallets do not, strictly speaking, charge a fee. Any fee mentioned refers to the mining transaction. This is highly fluid as it depends on the size (in bytes) of the transaction. The size (in bytes) is dictated by the number of prior transactions which make up the size of the newest transaction.
Eg. 
Scenario a) Ten people send a total of 0.4 bitcoin to Alice. This means ten separate transactions were made into Alice's public address. 
Scenario b) two people send a total of 3 bitcoin to Bob.
If both Alice and Bob wish to send the exact sum they each recieved onto another address, Alice's fee will be higher due to the higher number of incoming transactions even though Bob's BTC sum is higher. 
So, wallets will not charge you, rather they will *inform* you of your options. Eg "high/medium/low" fee which will each depend on byte size. So Alice's "low" will be higher than Bob's "low" fee. Bear in mind that many wallets will let you dictate the fee you wish to pay with absolute granularity (eg 0.000001 BTC per byte) so you can send extremely cheaply regardless of size (though still dependent on size). This is what is meant by the "dynamic fee suggestion" and is fairly standard for most wallets.
You mentioned BTC *purchase* and this will incur an exchange/service fee which, if you like, has nothing to do with bitcoin in and of itself. This is essentially a commission paid to the exchange for brokering your purchase and is usually a flat rate (eg 4%).
Is this helpful?
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:48:42
Are you mixing up the wallet's transaction fees (ie sending bitcoin) with purchasing fees?
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:23:36
You misunderstand my point.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:11:08


No problems. This is a completely new era we're entering and no one really knows what's going to happen. Ergo, we're all here to learn and to make the best guesses we can. Full disclosure - I'm a bitcoin maximalist because everything I've learned so far is guiding me to be such. This doesn't, however, mean that I won't learn something *tomorrow* that will cause me to rethink my beliefs. 


I assume that you're not exactly condoning these shady dealings, rather asserting that they "need" to be carried out. If this is the case, it's a sad state of affairs. Perhaps a decentralised-ledger-based currency will force honesty through transparency. Don't you think it's worth a shot? 
Either way, I think that it would be quite naive to assume that the powers of the world won't adapt. Bad things will continue to happen. 
Irrespective of that, even if BTC is the reserve currency, who's to say that countries won't continue to print their own? Paper money is not going away for a long, long (long) time. Current older generations need to die off before we can realistically consider going completely digital. I'm late-thirties and would consider myself in that bracket.


I'm not sure I agree with this. Clearly, countries won't collapse - they will just be forced to adapt. 


You don't think that banks would simply adapt? They could offer crypto-vault services with their own hot wallet apps, offering indemnity for the less tech-savvy amongst us. Why would loans disappear? You're focusing on the instability of the currency here and are being short-term minded. 


Sorry but I'm not really sure what you're asking. Can you reword  your question?


Again, all currency is based on the dollar as the dollar is the global reserve currency. Other currencies have been the reserve at various points in the past so this could easily change. If the idea of BTC becoming the reserve is unpalatable, perhaps the idea of the EURO taking over makes more sense.

The only thing you should do with your bitcoin until the next bull run is claim the alts.
Use u/camku or u/cryptosnake to claim the alts and sell for the equivalent in BTC for you. You have the equivalent number of BCH too. Keep these until the hard fork snap shot on 15th Nov and you will have the equivalent in the new BCH coin too. Keep your eye on the two BCH coins and sell whichever looks the most likely to fail.
KEEP your BCH and BTC until the next bull run because it is imminent.

Unless your saying all imagery is encoded on the blockchain in base64, I don't see how this is relevant either.

Yup. This lends to it's 'decentralised' status. No 'leader' to make bad decisions or alienate users. 


Yup. It's a free market and of course it means that the risk is all your own. As we all know, however, regulation doesn't indemnify you against all risk anyway.


Just to be clear, "bitcoin" is quite robustly resistant to hacking. The infrastructure around it (exchanges) isn't. This will improve or become a non-issue (decentralised exchanges a la "Bisq", atomic swaps etc)

Well, whilst it's unfortunate that you missed the purchase window, I don't agree at all that you should have received more BTC (equivalent to your original amount in fiat) in return. Think about it, this makes no sense at all.
And yes, if the price of BTC had gone up, they would still have refunded you the same amount of BTC as BTC was the **currency** you chose to pay in.

Bearing in mind that the internet took 30 years to go mainstream, you really think cryptocurrencies would take an *extra 20* in *today's* technologically advanced society? I think that this is ridiculously pessimistic and that you are going to be very, very surprised. 


Bitcoin is *trustless* because it is decentralised. There is no way the masses would choose a centralised currency over a decentralised one. You're talking about a currency with *at least* one less feature than bitcoin. 


I agree, they must. The advent of bitcoin has been the first time in history that there has been such an opportunity for so large a transfer of wealth. We're already at the price levels where the average person can't afford 1 BTC. What a shame if more miss out because they can't see the wood for the trees. 


That's the whole point. Bitcoin [can't]( be hacked. And remember, it can always be updated if necessary - it is a software protocol, after all. 


Vulnerabilities will always be exploited. Bitcoin removes a *lot* of vulnerabilities which currently exist in the financial system. 
Bottom line, change is coming and you'll either remember bitcoin as a blip or you'll remember the time when some random guy on the internet engaged you in discussion and tried to assuage your concerns about an emerging technological advancement which took the world by storm.

You're missing the point. If the user doesn't know how the info is encoded, they can't decode it. To use your example, could you use "notepad" to decode and view a video?

I'm not debating anything, I'm trying to understand how much of an issue this could potentially be. 
If a user doesn't know how to decode the information how would they know there is imagery there? Additionally, as you state, they would need the transaction itself to get the "file" (which, to be clear, isn't an actual file but encoded data). It sounds as though it's only really accessible to people who know what they are looking for and where/how to find it.

Thanks for your candour


If you really do understand it so well, why do you say things like "The reason it's not a limited amount (Max 21 mill coins max) is that there are now 1300 "blockchain based cryptos" which are all the same thing in a way." in another thread?


Of course not. Neither do you. It doesn't stop you saying things like "Cryptos will start growing again after Bitcoin crashes to $500 and they can get decoupled from it." though!


That's quite a sad hobby. Especially for someone with an otherwise "big life". 


But you also say


You honestly sound like someone who feels as though they missed out on a great opportunity (you were going to buy at $1500, I assume) and you're feeling salty that other people are set to benefit. Why otherwise would you make this your hobby?

A) That's not the point. You implied that a 2000% increase year in invested capital is "easy money" but a 7-10% increase in invested capital isn't. Ergo, according to you, if you're only making a (relatively small) profit it isn't "easy money". Someone is salty.
B) it's not the average person that's trying a "dump and pump" with their 401Ks, you doofus, it's the companies investing for them. You think the average crypto user has the capital to perform a pump and dump? No. It's the whales and institutional investors.

Re: fungibility, I respectfully disagree. You would need to ignore the *intrinsic value* of the animals in order to see them as sole units for trade. eg my cows are healthier than yours so mine would be tasty, yours would not.
Interestingly, what you see as Crypto's biggest weakness is what I see as it's greatest strength. I think that the truth will always out, somewhere down the line and to that end I think that Crypto will force a form of honesty which, I'm sure we'll all agree, has long been lacking in finance.

Well, no. The "evil bank" (your quotation marks) could decide to never release your money to you or to spend it on something else. Or maybe they could collapse so your money just disappears.
If you hold the keys to your bitcoin, NO ONE can do that to your funds. Theoretically, you could remember your private key and therefore never risk it being stolen. 
Look, I think banks are necessary and will always exist in some form or another. I just think that the concept of money as we've always known it (backed by gold for christ's sake!) is tragically dated. We have computers in our pockets and trade with bits of plasticky paper!

Re-read what u/Talks_To_Cats wrote. It works in both directions. 
The more miners mining (ie the higher the hashing power) the more difficult it gets in order to compensate. If this weren't the case, all 21,000,000 bitcoins would be mined already. Correct?
Conversely, the less miners mining (ie the lower the hashing power) the easier it gets to mine blocks. If this weren't the case, there would be no more bitcoins mined (at least not easily) and therefore less incentive for mining and keeping the whole system afloat. 
And now are you beginning to appreciate the elegance of Satoshi's vision.

OK, they'd know it's on the blockchain, but they wouldn't know *where* on the blockchain. People know that there is undesirable content on the internet but don't know where or how to find it. 




Of course. But it's also decoded by your computer so that you can make use of it. Not the case with the blockchain. 




(I assume you mean "but that doesn't mean it *doesn't* get shared").
So the issue is that the blockchain can be used to propagate this content?

You don't spread fear, because you have none. You *do* spread Uncertainty and Doubt. Ergo we can presume you have both. 


I'm going to assume you didn't mean this because it's clearly a very stupid thing to say. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. 


Ah...here we go. 
I don't think that you're a paid shill. I don't think that paid shilling is quite as prevalent as we tend to think it is on this sub. What I think has happened is this: 
You heard about BTC a little while ago and, though interested, couldn't really understand why it was considered so important. So you looked into it some more, all the while observing the rising price. At some point, although you still didn't *really* see what the fuss was about, you decided you were going to get in on the bull run. Bitcoin was still making steady gains and, hey, who didn't want a piece of the action. And then it stopped. So you waited, nervously, for it to pick up again. Only it never did. It crashed. "FUUUU!!". That was a close shave. You would have lost money!
So now, here's the thing. Either it isn't yet as low as it was when you were originally going to get on *or* it doesn't matter to you anymore. You have decided that this 'currency' which you don't really understand isn't a viable investment for you and, therefore, it will continue to crash. It *must* continue to crash. Because you just don't get it. 
Inform yourself some more (so you know more than you currently know) and ask yourself what would be worse: If you buy a small amount of bitcoin, it disappears, and you lose some money or you *don't* buy a small amount of bitcoin and it rises. And rises. And rises. How do you think you'll feel looking back at your time on these boards, when you were spreading UD instead of informing yourself and taking steps to purchase some of that BTC when it was as low as 8K?
There is no ignoring cryptocurrencies and BTC is in all likelihood the most favourable to gain worldwide adoption. I sincerely hope you don't look back at these days with regret. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:44:36

No you wouldn't. The difficulty would drop drastically and you could do it with your phone. The difficulty increases/decreases with hashing power. If you didn't know this, perhaps you need to read a little more into the fundamentals of bitcoin. (No offence meant).
But yes, it would be useless if I couldn't send it to someone who wanted to trade.

@_date: 2018-02-15 11:10:45
The issue we have hear, people, is that OP doesn't understand that bitcoin (and all other cryptos) is [*fungible*]( just like, you got it, actual money. 
OP, what this means is that one bitcoin is exactly the same as another. You holding one over the other is a) unfeasible (unless they're are in separate wallets) and b) wholly unnecessary. 
Using your example of rabbits. If someone gives you a half-dead rabbit that you want to swap for 2 chickens, the chicken farmer may look at your rabbit and say 'yeah, not gonna happen. I'll give you one chicken for that half dead rabbit'. Tomorrow, you get another rabbit but this one is fat and healthy. The chicken farmer says 'nice rabbit. I'll give you 3 chickens and a bj for that rabbit'. These rabbits are NOT fungible. Everyone gets confused between currency and items used for barter. Goat, sheep, bananas, whatever, are not good for currency usage for this reason. Different value can be attributed to individual 'units'.
Now, back to your question...if your mum gives you £50 to buy a nice t-shirt and, when you go to the shop, the price has gone up to £55 you can no longer afford that t-shirt, correct? Now, say if your dad then gives you another £50, which £50 are you going to use? You'll use both and take the change, right? Does it matter which one you take change from? No. Because sterling currency is fungible. (Imagine it was non-fungible rabbits instead - you could use a whole of the healthy one, no probs, but the unhealthy one wouldn't suffice). 
Now, the problem with the example above is that the item you're purchasing has changed price whereas the example you give in OP is regarding two changing commodities. 
Consider you're going on holiday. You need to change some £ for $. How would you play that? That's exactly the same situation you're describing. Would you use more, different £ to buy the recently cheaper $ if you'd already bought at a worse rate previously?
Hope this makes sense.

OP, try putting the private address into 'bitaddress.org' (wallet details). Tick BIP38 and it will open a field for the password. 
If your password is correct, 'view details' should reveal the WIF address (un-encrypted version). 
Make sure you do all of this offline once you are on the webpage. 
If this doesn't work to reveal the WIF, you can be certain that your password is incorrect. You can also try a bunch of variations here without issue. Hope this helps.

Actually, sheep and cows can't really be considered "money" either. Money really needs to be fungible in order to have value in a true system of trade. 
If I lost internet access, or the miners went away, it would still be my bitcoin - it just wouldn't be very useful as I couldn't do anything with it! So your point stands, for sure. There is a certain level of trust still required. 
With bitcoin, and all "ecurrency", this is certainly a new paradigm we're entering and what we understand about money is really going to be torn apart. Which is probably why so many people have a hard time understanding the value of bitcoin... 
I used to work in finance and couldn't convince anyone in my office that there was any value in Bitcoin back in 2010. And this is people who understand money! So of course, maybe these digital currencies are facing insurmountable obstacles (though I personally doubt it).

The link they sent you shows the number of transactions processed recently and how long they took, by fee paid per byte. You'll notice that as you look down the chart, the time taken to process gets shorter (quickly showing "0").
As you know, inputs and outputs combine to give each transaction it's own weight (measured in bytes). So this chart shows you how long you can expect your transaction to take *based on how much was paid per byte.*
Either you know the fee paid per byte and so they sent you this for you to work out how long it should take, or they've sent you the wrong link.
Either way, two hours is too long at the moment so either they didn't pay a fee and they're hoping it'll get processed anyway or your request hasn't been processed by earn.com.

Why would needing the internet be an issue? Can't you foresee a time when we are always connected, everywhere? 
The biggest obstacles to Bitcoin adoption includes the ability of people to understand how it works even at a high level (where's the actual coin?) and the ability for us to project *how* it could be used daily in our lives. At the moment, the idea of a truly digital currency seems improbable however, this is exactly what payments made by debit/credit cards or even online are. When was the last time you took out cash to make a purchase of more than £50 (or $50)? Hell, I can't remember the last time I had to withdraw cash fullstop!
For some reason, describing this scenario and stating there is no physical money backing the digital (and of course there is no physical cash for all of the digital fiat - though of course there could be if you wanted to withdraw it) makes it suddenly seem fantastical. 
The fuck do I know though. I'm still waiting for a hoverboard.

On the website you linked it is stated that a Nelson Mandela image is stored on the blockchain. The Hex codes are specific addresses which need to be converted to unicode in the correct sequence. Please explain how anyone that *doesn't* know what they are looking for can do this.

"The remaining instance is an image depicting mild nudity of a young woman.
In an online forum this image is claimed to show child pornography, albeit this
claim cannot be verified (due to ethical concerns we refrain from providing a citation).
Notably, two of the explicit images were only detected by our suspicioustransaction

First move your BTC to a different wallet. Once this is done and you're sure that they are safe, you can sweep the old wallets for the forked coins.
I actually used two android apps (bither and bitpie) to sweep my old paper wallets and claim all alts. 
Once you've claimed your coins, move them to an exchange to sell them off. Bear in mind that some of them aren't accepted in exchanges yet so you may need to keep a hold of them (on bitpie) for a while.
Also, just because those apps worked for me please don't assume that they are completely safe. I'm not endorsing their usage, just letting you know what worked for me.

BTC is hard-forked when developers want to take it elsewhere in terms of where BTC development is going. Eg with BCash, Ver et al wanted to increase the block size to increase transaction numbers but this is generally seen as a bandaid solution (to the congestion issue) at best. 
So...you have 10 BTC. Someone comes along and wants to create a new currency by forking bitcoin on 1st December. You now have 10 BTC and 10 BCash at the same address. On 5th December, someone creates another fork (Bitcoin Gold). You now have 30 coins in your wallet; 10 BTC, 10 BCash and 10 Bitcoin Gold (NB: these coins are generated depending on when the fork occurs. Assuming you controlled the private keys at each of these points, you will own the alt-coins). 
So...to move your altcoins, you will need to expose your private keys as when making a bitcoin transaction. Therefore, best practice would be to move your bitcoin first (as it is the most valuable) and ensuring that it is safe before trying to move the alts. This is simply because the first transaction will expose your private key. Eg if you moved your BCash first, your private key has been exposed so you risk your Bitcoin being stolen. 
To be clear, your coins are all sitting in your BTC address and you could move the alts alone (leaving the Bitcoin where it is) but this would be considered bad practice. 
Use [this site]( or [this site]( to check what you have using your *public* key only (note that the USD values aren't accurate, however).
Depending on how much BTC you currently own, you could be sitting on a very large sum of altcoins!

This is correct, but only because the USD is the global [reserve currency]( This largely came about due to the domination of the American economy at the time and is liable to change. Perhaps bitcoin will be the future reserve currency. 


It is based on demand. It is no different to regular [Foreign Exchange]( and is impacted by all sorts of things (economy, politics, travel etc etc).


I'm not sure I understand what you're asking here. By "labor hour" you mean the cost of labor which is already vastly different across the globe. 


Well, the answer is that you can't. That doesn't mean that it's not likely in the future once the adoption rate has increased and it is more stable. 


As was the internet which was also routinely dismissed as a 'fad'. Read [this]( interesting piece about a Newsweek article from 1995. Even the inventor of [ethernet]( gave the internet a shelf-life of 12 months!
Remember, we are still at the very early stages. I know, I know, it has been 10 years. Just to put it into context, the internet was originally conceived in the '60s and wasn't ready for release to the masses until tcp/ip was invented in 1983. The world wide web wasn't invented until 1990 and look at it now. By the way, the internet has always been plagued by scaling issues and it has always adapted (because it's decentralised, perhaps?). 
The concept of "digital money" is a very difficult one to grasp when the entirety of human civilisation has been built on the trade and commerce of tangible currencies and units of barter however, we are more open to digitisation than ever before and we are only going to become more so. It is inevitable.

Definitely agree. 
I understand that they're providing a valuable service and should be remunerated for it but, when all they're doing is providing a middleman solution to the problem, it does leave a bitter taste. Especially when you have to give up 10% of the total cost of an item which you're often making a loss on anyway (talking about individuals selling unwanted prior purchases of course). 
It was worse when they owned PayPal. You'd get charged 10% of the total, but this wasn't taken out of the payment immediately. That way they could double charge you with the PayPal fee on top of the eBay fee. That always grated.
Fortunately, they now often have "sell for £3/£1 max" offers which is the only thing that makes it worthwhile in my eyes.

Definitely. Even ignoring the potential of "smart contracts" it's essentially happening already. This is what ICOs will evolve into.

That's not true. Perhaps they were moving their coins so that they could claim some alts? Or perhaps they were moving from one type of an address to another. Perhaps they realised that their password had been compromised or that they wanted to move to a hard wallet. On top of that, people are not always predictable and there could be any number of reasons for them to move their coins. 
For you to take the leap and assume that they are going to sell is unnecessarily negative and probably the definition of FUD.

I see what you're getting at. That isn't what OP was thinking but, even if it was, it would be a bit thick to assume it would have any affect on the market and a bit silly to start fearmongering.

Lol. There are so many examples of this dating back yeeeears. The incredible thing is that each dip/crash no-coiners pop out of the woodwork to declare that bitcoin is "dead". And of course, they're right each and every time. But then it rises. And rises. Then it dips and bitcoin is "dead" etc etc.

Sorry, my mistake.I meant "Please explain how 86,000 coins sold via exchange would affect the price less if spread over a greater number of exchanges" (rephrased for clarity)


If you're selling 86,000 coins for a single client over exchange, no matter how many exchanges, then you are doing it wrong.

@_date: 2018-07-24 12:06:10
Edit: just to be clear, OP is ridiculing those who think that they are able to predict price movements. I am fully aware of this and am ridiculing those who say "this time it's different" in response to anyone who suggests that the price *won't* move in a way similar to what it has done in the past. Both are ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:10:41
Lol. Sure. "This time it's different".
@_date: 2018-07-05 07:20:53
Please explain how 86,000 coins sold via exchange wouldn't affect the price and how the number of exchanges used would make any difference.
Connecting counterparties off-exchange is *literally* what OTC brokers do. It's cute that you think an OTC broker would spread 86,000 coins over multiple exchanges though - as if they've found a sneaky way to fool the system. 


Oh the the irony. And nice touch disparaging me - it does help give you an air of arrogance. Surely someone so arrogant knows what they're talking about...

I assume you mean "to be marketed as" as opposed to "market itself" as clearly that's not possible.
Regardless, one of the best things about bitcoin is that it can't really be "marketed" as anything as there is no controlling authority a la the majority of alts. People will use it as is, or they won't. It'll just carry on existing. 
Regardless, currencies *are* stores of value. That's also kind of the point of them.

I find it quite amusing that you feel able to make bold assertions about the machinations of a market you don't understand and yet you can't even pull out the obvious salient points from your own line of comments.
The (paraphrased) "negative for bitcoin" and "he's probably going to sell on an exchange" comments constitute the FUD.

I've been watching [this]( chart since November. I know that TA with bitcoin is speculative at best but it's uncanny how closely the price has been following the prediction.

@_date: 2018-04-17 21:06:46
Yes, I know it was but you're missing the point of my question.
If bitcoin's value is solely due to it's speculative nature then why was it ever used to transact with in the past?
You've actually unwittingly answered this question: because it had the value of allowing for relatively anonymous transactions.
Therefore, bitcoin had a perceived value far, far greater than it's monetary value (at that time) considering a) how difficult it was to obtain and b) how esoteric it's usage was. 
You would do well to consider that it's pseudo-anonymous nature (it's not anonymous enough for some) is actually widely regarded as one of its weaknesses in the face of its other many other attributes. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:13:56

No, not "literally" a pyramid scheme. 
In a pyramid scheme, members are encouraged (coerced?) into recruiting *more* members with the promise of increased payouts and or benefits. This goes up as the number of further members enrolled increases. 
No one cares if you or anyone else buys bitcoin and no one is trying to encourage you to do so. In fact, I would much rather you didn't. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:06:30
Same. To be honest, it's still pretty early for getting into cryptocurrency and if you don't do your due diligence then that's on you. 
Part of me worries that a lawsuit will  result in greater controls in order to protect those without the nous to ensure they aren't getting scammed.
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:10:26


Well no it isn't, obviously, but I think that your point is that buying bitcoin is gambling even though there are no "odds", there is no "luck" and there is no "house". 
You're basically saying that whether or not bitcoin becomes truly relevant as a currency depends on luck. Not the tech behind it, not it's actual use cases, not it's immutability or the backing of X,Y,Z and not due to the time and efforts of hundreds of people throughout the past 10 or so years. Luck. When adoption has hit the masses, you'll say "bitcoiners got lucky" when all of the signs had been there for you too. Think about that for a while.
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:30:44
There is no point in second-guessing. You may get lucky, you may not. This could be a short-lived pump and dump, a long-lived bear market or the start of an epic bull-run. 
Ask yourself: would I be more gutted about missing out on the small gains of fluctuation or the bigger gains of a bull-run? Then put your money in and make your peace. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:44:23
It's the new bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:58:27
First off you're comparing fiat, issued by sovereign states as the only recognised and physically tangible currency within their borders, to a new, borderless ungoverned and wholly digital currency. *Of course* it's more volatile. That's a ridiculous assertion to make. The term [new paradigm]( may as well have been invented for bitcoin.
Secondly, it's hardly as though fiat (all currencies) are without fluctuations. Being in Europe myself, I remember how far the pound used to go when travelling to the US or mainland Europe. Not so much anymore. Granted, the fluctuations with bitcoin are (for now) much, much greater but see my comment re "new paradigm".
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:20:07
You misunderstand OP
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:37:25


No, it really isnt. By your definition, all investments (index based or not) are gambling. You can redefine the term to fit your views all you like. It won't make you any more correct.


You're patently wrong. Exchanges, whales and miners have no control of my bitcoin whatsoever.


Still not correct. You clearly find it hard to accept that you are in control of your financial situation - no one else.


Neither. I control my keys ergo I have ultimate control of my funds. Who has ultimate control of yours?


But bitcoin *is* the future of money you just have your head buried too deep in the sand to see it.
There comes a point when you just need to admit to yourself, if no one else,  that you just don't *want* bitcoin  to succeed because you're too afraid to invest your money own money in it.
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:20:41

You see the value of a currency with the properties I listed, but you think that *globally* it's worth less than 8K. OK.


Translated as: No matter how you try to explain or justify it's value to me, I refuse to accept that it is worth as much as it is. 
I don't know why you either don't want to understand or just plainly refuse to but I sincerely hope that you won't look back at your comments with regret.

Bitcoin has been here since 2009 and is seemingly older than most of the redditors responding to your post (joke - nothing but love &lt;3).
That's *9 years* of solid growth with constant development and innovation. It has its detractors, sure, but also its champions of equal renown. People have invested countless hours and fiat into it and they continue to do so.
So the question, really, is what would make it drop to zero? Answers: 1) A more successful coin, 2) the discovery of a fatal flaw in the protocol.
How likely is 1)? The way I see it is that bitcoin will always have one killer feature over any competitor - an unknown and silent creator. That's way more important than people realise. Any new coin without a known creator would likely be treated with utmost suspicion at this stage (created by government? Facebook? Banks? Etc). Of course there are other reasons but I'll leave it at this.
How about 2)? 9 years of intense scrutiny (by the best minds in crypto) and a fatal flaw hasn't been discovered. The only way it'll happen now is due to improvements in tech and Bitcoin will simply be improved (it is a software protocol after all) to compensate.
Naysayers will say it's just a fad, or a bubble, but they've been saying that and poking fun since BTC was 10 cents.
There is no chance of bitcoin going to zero.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:34:57


OK. So why was it used originally when it was worth considerably less?

So, are you the first to develop this idea, as far as you're aware? How is the bitcoin used, exactly? Is it just to get the value in the blockchain?
This could be a great feature in some ways but also negative in others, such as with regards to anonymity etc. how do you see it being used? I guess users would choose to record the information. Eg deeds, ownership of assets etc?

@_date: 2013-12-31 11:48:13
This is interesting. Thanks for the link. 
For what it's worth, my wallet had jack in it so whoever is doing this must be making payments to completely random addresses as opposed to those with a large balance. It's interesting that they were originally giving out 1BTC but are now paying 1mBTC as the value has gone up! 
Having said that, I did have a chunk in it a few weeks ago that I transferred out to separate paper wallets. Could that have been the trigger to add me to some sort of list? 
This does worry me a little bit. I can't help but feel that the motivations behind doing this are sinister. Surely someone with good intentions would let people know what they were doing and why. Hopefully time will tell.
@_date: 2013-12-31 13:03:46
Thanks ELY5. I'm not concerned about anonymity but I don't understand how my identity could be determined. Would it be by linking the original payment to the paper wallet to my blockchain account and then emails etc from there?
@_date: 2013-12-31 11:36:38
This is very interesting, but to what end? And the chances of managing to group together addresses belonging to the same entity seems ridiculously small. Could there be some sinister intention behind it?
If you happen to remember where you got this from, I'd appreciate you pointing me to it.

@_date: 2013-12-31 12:23:23
Ah man, thanks for this. I got confused. I have an old blockchain wallet that I don't use and assumed that it was that one as the email notification comes from them.
It looks like they actually made the payment into one of my paper wallets. I've linked my paper wallets as "watched wallets" with my blockchain account (hence the email).
As its a paper wallet, I know that I'm secure but is there anything else you would recommend I do? 
Thanks for your responses, BTW.

One thing I don't understand, if the original content is deleted, how can you prove what it was? Eg, submit a photo, how can you prove the time stamp refers to that specific photo? Is the original content kept in a backup by the user so that the hash can be compared? This is blowing my mind.
