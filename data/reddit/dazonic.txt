I'm saying, if you're poor enough and financially retarded enough to only have $20 in your account and cop an overdraft fee, you have no place in this insanely speculative market.

Both Nakamotos:
- Very unique name
- Highly skilled engineer
- Defined as a very strange person by people who know them
Maybe not 100% definitive proof, but enough for me. This saga isn't over. I just feel sorry for the poor bloke, he just wants to be left alone.

I'm not talking to everybody. Just this guy. He's clueless with money.

If you like resale value and regular software and security updates on devices more than 12 months old however…

Everyone in tech knows, and Tim Cook even acknowledged everyone's mobile payments attempts on stage. But they failed to break mainstream, and consumer tech that barely gets used is pretty pointless. NFC in phones and used for payments was dreamed about years ago, even around gen 1 iPhone people were talking about it. If it eventually goes huge, credit won't go to the idea or first-to-market, it goes to first-to-mainstream.

Your phone or PayWave/PayPass on your card? Wish people here would differentiate card NFC from phone NFC, I'm a bit lost.

I'm asking a serious question, step back and read your comments, do you not feel as if you're in a cult? Or abusive relationship? You're stumbling over yourself and sidestepping logic just to reassure yourself.

...until the next controversy. I'll give it 2 months.

Partners. And ease of use, and marketing. The entire number of people who've ever used NFC phone payments will probably be dwarfed in a week by Apple Pay. Everything about this last announcement epitomises how Apple never really does anything first, and how the people who keep bringing it up don't understand what makes Apple successful.
