People see frame plate....”hmm I wonder what Toy motorsports is”...google search....”oh that’s shits sick....cant afford it”.....but, someone can afford it, which is win for them and probably him somehow.  
You could be right, but so could I.

"and we a going to pay you % of all their minings."
      seems legit

Still trying to find out if you actually finished a thought there.  Prices get pumped all the time, Bitcoin's especially.  When altcoins separate themselves from Bitcoin's reign, and the useless coins make their way out of the game, the coins with real use cases will flourish, along with Bitcoin, but in their own image.

The other way you could lose money is if whatever you invested in goes belly up.  That will also result in similar effects

Actually know some people who have made quite a bit selling rare beanie babies. Somehow lucrative

1 doge = 1 doge, so, it all adds up to me.

Well of course, you needed the laptop to trade.

Not like some of that loan money won’t be going to things like drugs, alcohol, and the like. Bitcoin is a step up from some of the things that money would go towards.

Well I’d take that bet and in. It was actually thousands of dollars in revenue. I know she sold the Valentine’s Day one with the heart, and she had an original American flag beanie baby she sold for a couple thousand. So I’d say she’s recouped any losses and then some, and is doing better than I am with animals made out of beans. I should re-evaluate.

boy was this guy wrong.
"Wow, lmao.
Bitcoin didn't catch on when it had the chance to which was back in may-June. people got way to greedy since it was basically free money for just running your computer and created a bubble.
For the past 3 month the price of bitcoin has gone down consistently and is showing no signs of ever going up. No political or socioeconomic factors have yet done anything to effect the price.
Bitcoins are still going to be used but I don't think you'll ever see it over 10$ again."
