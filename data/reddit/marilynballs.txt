Do you sincerely believe this? Because it's just a loony conspiracy theory.

Unfortunately, there's way more groupthink in that subreddit than there ever was here.

Get real. This thread was seriously brigaded by the goons. The  new sorting deals with that problem.

Well that would be weird, since I would arguing for your position. You made the claim that fear of raising the 21m limit is a 'red herring', I'm  disputing that by saying that it's plausible that the majority of users sometime in the not-so-distant future could be convinced by an organized campaign to raise the limit, using all kinds of seductive arguments. I'm sure you have the imagination to think of a few.
@_date: 2016-01-14 07:11:29
Why is it a red herring? It's completely plausible. Assuming that the majority of new users are well in Bitcoin's future, why wouldn't they "vote" themselves cheaper coins by raising the 21M limit?

Centralized dev team that implements a centralizing consensus mechanism.

They really think that a company is just going to swap out its node software, which is its interface to the Bitcoin financial network, for something slapped together by a bunch of amateurs that includes radical changes to its block validation code.

That's how I see it too. Adoption pressure is real.

Roger "I've divested into Altcoins" Ver will tell us what to do!

BitPay says that it's seeing a significant rise in international B2B payments, and that those businesses don't care about the fees. Bitcoin is destined to be a secure and transferable store of value that is resistant to censorship. Seems pretty good to me!
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:11:10
Yes, and since Roger is a major investor in alt coins, it is easy to understand why he won't activate SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:55:04
If you support bigger blocks, then you must support SegWit. Since SegWit allows for bigger blocks without risking a chain split, it is the obvious incremental step for increasing capacity moving forward. 
BU is dangerous and will cause a chain split, community split and lost value. So it is true that no single development team owns bitcoin, but why would you want the BU team in particular to own the reference client? It's crazy.

Uncontroversial hard forks go smoothly with everyone going to the new chain. 
Controversial hard forks lead to two incompatible chains, each with their own communities keeping them viable.

Most of the transactions are low value/spam. Fees help to keep the spam under control. When the system was under a stress test attack, it performed perfectly as long as you were willing to spend 5 or 10 cents per transaction. Most of the spam transactions eventually got dumped from the mempool.

It is the pro XT commenters that are slinging all the mud from what I can see. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:15:26
Here is an opportunity for us to try to understand Luke-jr's point of view, and maybe of the view of some of the people who are against the hard fork, and the crazy mob is down voting it so the rest of the community can't see it.

"Technically complex" is such a ludicrous argument. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 06:28:42
You abandoned Bitcoin and are all-in on Ethereum so why should we take what you say seriously?
