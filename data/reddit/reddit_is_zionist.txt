Sure, in theory. But which buyer would you prefer:  the one who buys politely and then says goodbye, or the one who drools all over face, shits on your carpet, and then starts screaming in a high voice about poor people?
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:06:12
Furthermore, debt itself is a weapon of enslavement, and was designed as such by our "masters," as David Graeber explains thoroughly in his book.

I see, yes;  it's cute, but these places already exist with a variety of services catering entirely to them. As Max Keiser points out, they have an entirely parallel economy worth 20 trillion, strangely enough the same number that "went missing" from our economy according to the Paradise Papers. They're called the One Percent.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:42:15
Try anything;  read more of what you like, then see who influenced those writers:  they'll usually say.
Of course, you can't go wrong with the 'Great Books'  -   the epic of gilgamesh, the Iliad, plato's republic, etc
@_date: 2018-06-24 02:22:32
Thanks Ambrose, you putz!
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:38:47
Read more books Nash.  The more important question than "how do I make money" is "what do you want to do?"

The language of the article itself seems designed to mislead wealthy investors;  this is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:06:54
You should go to prison for 20 years.
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:55:24
In a way the fear is justified, though I would say inflation or its lack is just a red herring.  This is a revolution, and revolutions are never, ever bloodless.
