Why tether is there?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:23:08
What are you talking about? My point is that tether is not an investment, and it shouldn't be on your webpage, because it's just used instead of the us dollar in exchanges.

There is a project called NVO, a decentralized exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:16:26
It's supposed to be backed by the us dollar 1:1, so at the end it's worth $1.

I think there is many online wallets that are user friendly. Xapo was a good one, you log on with a pin, has 2fa, you can set on 2fa in transactions that exceed a certain amount, and also no fees between Xapo accounts.
I was using it, until they started charging fees on incoming transactions.

Increasing block size solution is already in use in Bitcoin Cash.

Is it Alan Greenspan? He was on a video some time ago saying that it's a fraud because it has no underlying value.

You don't exchange it to the dollar in the central bank, what even gives it that value in dollar, it's because there is people who are asking for it, not because the government gave it such value, so even if it will be outlawed, it will sink in value, but still keeps it as people will still be exchanging it in exchanges that are not US based, or if it goes bad, in the deep web.

It's the US, this is not North Korea or Saudi Arabia, they can't just ban you from buying something which doesn't harm anyone.
You believe in conspiracy theories, when you said "the danger it imposes on their monopoly of economical power", it's not like that, it's just a new technology and they should adapt to it.

Just don't panic, if a correction happen, just keep holding it, and seek the opportunity to buy again when it's low, so you don't fall in the trap of Buy high and sell low. If you go over the past corrections, Bitcoin come back even stronger.

The earth may be already full of trees and it's useless to plant one.
What I mean, it may be that 8 years from now, Bitcoin and the blockchain technology become so mainstream and normal in our life.

I think that when the reward decrease in the Halving, the price is supposed to increase so mining stays profitable for the miners.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:29:24
Because that would be unAmerican.

I didn't use it myself but I think it doesn't require ID.

I find it amazing that some people are joining Reddit just to ask things about buying Bitcoin.
Good luck, and welcome.
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:50:21
yeah yeah I get it now.

I think for the US government, it better leave the chance for it to be regulated than banned. When it's banned, people will still exchange it, they can't really stop them.

After a certain time, the reward for mining a block is spitted by half, it was 25 BTC per block but I guess 4 or 5 months ago, the halving occurred and the reward decreased to 12.5 BTC per block, and so on, after certain time, it will split by half again: 
What I'm saying is, for miners even if the reward is minimized, for them, the value will stay stable or stabilize after a certain time which means the price should go higher.
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:32:14
You may not understand my question, I already invested in Bitcoin so that reflect my optimism toward Bitcoin, but what I'm saying is, first I know that when the halving occur and the reward split by half, it will increase the value of Bitcoin because the source of it decreased, but with time, now the reward is 12.5 BTC then 6.25 BTC then ..., miners will not see it profitable if the price of BTC didn't proportionally increase when the halving occur, so the reward in USD stays stable for them.

It will never happen.

They have a point, deal with it.

How much did it take for the transaction to get confirmed?

Assuming that the downtrend has finally ended and now it's coming back.

Indeed you are dumb, to not know that there is no official profile, and if you found out the unofficial profile of him, he wouldn't have vendetta mask in hid profile picture.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:04:28
That's a fake profile.
He doesn't have a LinkedIn profile.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:18:31
Are you too dumb to make such a post?
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:18:19
The augur markets can either confirm or disconfirm this.
