I actually believe it will be a currency someday, and a really great one. Now I won't feel like I missed out if it continues on it's present course but I have reduced my risk to 0%

Yeah, this doesn't seem right. Nothing should rise this fast, exponentially fast. Since I got in at 4500$ I've been pulling my original investment back 20% at a time. Now I'm playing with house money and this still is making me nervous. I mean I guess I love seeing it go up but... maybe not quite so scary fast, there's alot of new adopters but.. something seems off.

I did too but I'm not worried. Feet up with everything to gain and nothing to lose. The gains that are still in Bitcoin are double my initial investment.

I don't know how. Alot of folks in this sub overestimate how tech savvy the average person is. I bought some Bitcoin because I believe it will come to be a useful type of currency someday. It seems to me that the reason it's not a currency yet is a little skepticism and volitiliy but mostly ease of use. There's apps, I know, they seem super simple to you but the world needs them even simpler for both merchants and customers. It's kinda like a Pied Piper type of situation, if only tech people write, use, and review these apps you have a skewed perception in regards to how easy they are to actually use, they are not. People shit on Coinbase but I wouldn't have bought Bitcoin without them, so they've brought capital to the market increasing your value. Anyways, I would spend it if I could.
