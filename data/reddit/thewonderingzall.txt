Arnt the fees still high with ETH?
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:46:26
Yeah on my wallet is dynamic, so my fee could be higher than the actual amount I transfer out...

You don’t understand, I’m from South Africa, and I’m using 1 of the 2 exchanges available in my region, and the only other crypto that is offered is ETH, why do you think I want to transfer, so I can buy litecoin, I’m trying to get it to the Bittrex exchange

This is actually funny because  I told my parents the same thing in 2011, and they just brushed it off, and called me stupid for buying into a scam... by the way I’m 21 now and have hodl ever since.
Anyways yesterday, my parents asked me to buy BTC for the them. I guess better late than never right...

Thanks man, first sensible reply I’ve had, and you’re extremely right, thanks for the advice, and I think I’ve just answered my own question. I’ll hold it ����

Any recommendations on where I should store my BTC, currently keeping in an exchange called Luno or are there better options, I would use coinbase but it doesn’t support my county 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:09:41
Always be hodling
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:51:10
Let me just smell the future.... *sniff* *sniff*
It smells like you should hodl
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:44:04
Always hodl

I don’t really know what all the fuss is about, here in South Africa, BTC hit 10000 last week already, must be that exchange difference...

Bitcoin never crashes...it just goes on sale for a limited time offer.

Lol...I think I just died a little after reading that������
