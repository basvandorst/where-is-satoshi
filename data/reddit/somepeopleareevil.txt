I'm really glad I read this post prior to calling customer service today (I've been on the phone with them pretty much everyday). It's so awkward because I always dance around what the "transaction" was hahah. 
I'm currently dealing with an "analyst" (fraud dept staff are all retards) in a "case" about the issue. They refunded all the charges/fees that came along with the scam, such as chargeback fee, overdraft fee, etc. But they know it and I know it, I'll never see my money again. 
I just think it's fucking stupid that the bank will actively acknowledge and accept that an individual walked into one of their branches, and deposited two fraudulent checks into a customers account, in my case twice in the same day!! WTF does my bank do for me?? They can't get off their lazy asses and at least, pull up one of the fucking 50 camera feeds they have running 24/7, grab the guys face and and send it to the police? Disregard that, they wont even INFORM the police?? I have to?
Fuck them, I'm closing my accounts at the end of this. A 10yr relationship with that bank and my first problem they hang me out to dry. BOA go FYS

Yeah, I know the money's gone, I've accepted that. Life is life...
But should I really even go to the bank or police then? Why not just have the bank take the money from my account and leave it at that? I'd rather not have any repercussions at all...

I took down my ad so there aren't going to be any more. Now I just have to deal with the cash that's in my account that belongs to someone else. i.e. the "middle man".

...another user ended up starting and completing the trade (chose the largest amount to buy, deposited to my account, sebt pic of dep slip). I never answered chat, and disputed the trade as a fraud. However the $ sits in my bank account. I fear this will make me look even more guilty.

comment above yours was deleted, any insight?

Looks like the third trade that came in before I could close my account is also a scam, so my bank has frozen my account. It's now morning here and I'm just sitting on my couch waiting for the high probability that the cops with show up :(

omg... Damn dude I am so sorry... So you basically went through exactly what I'm going through right now, and also for aprox the same amount stolen. wow...
This crap is absolutely ridiculous. However, I understand there's really nothing I can do about the money, and have accepted it as gone (as much as it hurts, really really bad). Now I am focusing on what to do now to lessen any future repercussions. 
Since you went through this, do you have any suggestions for me? Is there anything you did that you wish you did different? Any suggestions on how to approach the issue? i.e. portraying that you're the victim and you want to fight to get your money back..? Because, to be perfectly honest, the one at fault (other than scammer) is the stupid idiot who deposited cash into a random account attempting to purchase from a stranger online... He made the deposit into my (and your) account, why the hell are we at fault??
Further, should I wait for the bank to contact me, call customer service, or actually visit the bank? Do you think there would be any benefit for *me* to go to the police, in an effort to do anything (even if there's nothing) to try and find the scammer? His account is still active on LB and he has email and phone verified.
Finally, was Local Bitcoins able to provide you with any sort of assistance at all? I've been flooding them with info and questions and have yet to receive a response.. To be honest, I hold them partially responsible as well because they label cash deposits as one of the top safest selling methods, which is exactly what a new seller is usually looking for... and low and behold, I get f**kd on my 3rd, 4th, and now 5th trade...
*Thank you soooo much for any help you can provide.*

Done so, actually 3 different times lol.
I'm worried that I actually have 3 on my hands now, as I hadn't closed my trade until I saw the bank hold...

Yes, that's exactly what's happening to me right now.
