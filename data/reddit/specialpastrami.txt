How are you gonna get it back when your planning to fund your summer in europe? When you bought it at $250 and its currently around $560s now? Do you plan on mining? Or just doing doing oddjobs for them?
Sorry if it seemed like a dumb question

I'm a casual guy so I only bought $20 worth and $50 of Eth. Once I budget a little bit more, I'll put in more

Been waiting, sent a ticket and they told me because there's a high number of new sign ups

Is it really cheaper with bitcoin? Doesn't steam adjust the prices? I live in the US, would consider buying with bitcoin if it is cheaper 
@_date: 2017-04-21 08:39:56
That feel when you missed an opportunity to buy at cheaper price :/

I guess its a bad time to ask if I should buy Bitcoin now...

I'm still waiting on my verification from gemini...

Is there a way to have my Electrum wallet on both my Laptop (Linux) and my Desktop (windows). I usually do bitcoin related things on my Laptop, but if I need to get something asap I would like to check my wallet on my desktop. Do I need to do it through Multisig? (Still dont know what this is).
Please explain like I'm 5....

I just got verified today, waited like 20 days

How will it benefit in the long term. I doubt drugs and etc will not be the majority of what is sold on OpenBazaar
@_date: 2016-09-17 21:26:06
How was buying games on steam? Was it easy and cheaper??
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:26:40
Please don't max out your credit card
@_date: 2016-09-17 04:48:08
Is this a good thing or bad thing for Open Bazaar? I would assume some drug dealers are gonna use it but isn't the block chain traceable??

They could play it where Kenny was an early investor and Cartman starts doing some regulation type shit. Kenny buys lambos and hookers, by the time the episode ends he's back being poor because it's all magic internet money.

I hope a subgroup picks this show up

Also is it even a good time to invest ($100), I will I be able to make massive gains like Alt-coins?

I dont know much about having to carry it with you, but for example your phone is stolen what can you do about it? 
Its not like a trezor/ledger where you can reset it after a couple mistakes

Buy Ltc on a dip, basically use profits when you buy stuff. Even tho btc was supposed to be used as a currency. Obviously isn't the case anymore since so many people consider it like gold and will sell it when the price is insanely high
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:11:47
Did they ever fix that exploit on their wallet? Was it really ever secure?
