*If it gets there it Bitcoin = $XXXXX*
These projections are nice and all but there's no real discussion on how you will get to those numbers.  This type of speculation is dangerous because it keeps attracting more people that want to get rich and not the people that will actually use it for it's utility.
I encourage you to discuss how it might get there and not how much it will be worth if it gets there.

This is untrue. Silk road removed weapon sales early on because it's community had major issues with it. No one really offers illicit services outside of selling drugs.

The posts you linked contain sound advice and you are decrying them for presenting a viewpoint you don't share.  If I had listened to the advice and analysis they are providing back in April, I'd be thousands richer.
Do I believe Bitcoin is a revolutionary experiment that could drastically change the way we use money?  Yes.
Do I believe that Bitcoin is a good thing to hold right now? Absolutely not.
Public interest is down.  The demand for Bitcoin is down. The supply coming in is currently inflationary.  It's harder to buy Bitcoins with many exchanges shutting down.  If you're holding Bitcoin for the long term, good for you, but don't tell the rest of us we should watch our holdings shrink in value.

The implications are not that big.  Let me try to explain why.  Silk Road runs independently of Bitcoins' trading price.  It will still operate if Bitcoins are worth 0.01 USD.  As long as there is not a fatal flaw in Bitcoins, the utility of it to Silkroad users will always remain.  Throughout Silkroad's operational duration, and during it's largest period of growth, Bitcoin prices were below 15 USD.  The ever increasing user base of Silkroad only drove Bitcoin prices to 15$.  The recent increase in BTC value is not due to Silkroad, but an ever increasing public awareness of the possibilities of Bitcoin.  Perhaps Bitcoin owes it's early value increases to Silkroad, but it has since shed the training wheels and is a beast all it's own.

It will tell whatever story you want it to tell.  What news event precipitated the crash from 266?  None that I know of.  The people still blaming DDOS and lag on price drops are grossly mistaken.  There have since been many DDOS and lag events that have occurred during price rises or only resulted in momentary price dips.  We have a tendency to give narrative explanations to events that are random.  During the price climb, media outlets and many people were touting Cyprus as a huge influence. A nice story, but not a causal explanation.
I'm not saying that positive or negative news has no impact on the price, it certainly does. But I would caution coming to conclusions that news events are affecting Bitcoin prices in a causal manner, the price movements are better explained by randomness and herd mentality.
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:38:00

I'll try.  There's a tendency for some Bitcoin enthusiasts to appear anti-government.  For many in this set, they simply wish for governments to wield less power and let the free market work itself out, or they would like to see governments impose fewer restrictions on their citizens.  For the most part, this is fine and sane.  There are, however, those who see "The Government" as synonymous with evil.  In their shortsighted generalizations, they believe that everything the government does is out to get them, that there is an consortium of evil controlling these governments, and thus they are all one and the same.

Very similar to astrology in many ways, they both measure stuff and come to conclusions that may or may not be bogus.  In either case, both rarely check for validity and accuracy.  However, the big difference is that Technical Analysis is used by A LOT of traders.  The effect of this is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  If enough people use it to trade and influence the markets, it becomes a real effect, one that you should be informed of if you want to have a good sense of where the price is going.

You've made fatal errors in your line of reasoning and assumptions.  You believe everyone will hold onto their Bitcoins and no one will sell at some point.  First, there are miners who will constantly have Bitcoins to add to the market.  Second, Bitcoin is valuable because it has potential as a means of exchange.  People will use Bitcoin to exchange for goods and services, or they will exchange it for a currency to do those things.  You're making it sound like Bitcoin is valuable for some magical intrinsic purpose, it's not.
The outcomes you fear will happen won't happen because this is a free market.

Slowly cooling off after the meteoric bubble.  If you're in it long, not to worry.  A lot of people were in this for the quick buck.  Now that that opportunity has past these people are leaving (some off to speculate in LTC or in Bitcoin related stocks).  For the past month, most speculators realized that the overall interest and demand for BTC has gone, that means less people buying Bitcoins and more people looking to exit their positions.  Expect this trend to continue for some time until the next hype cycle begins.

This.  It is very difficult to trade during lag.  It's almost a crapshoot, because you need to adjust your bid/asks for 10 minutes down the road, but the information you get is 10 minutes old.

I think you are overestimating their ability to predict the correct point of entry on a drop.  If they aim too low, they miss out on getting in.  If they aim too high, they risk the possibility of it tanking further and they will lose money.  In order for the DDoS induced panic to work, they have to accurately buy in at the right price, this may appear to be easy to do in hindsight, but it is extremely difficult.

Here's the things with bubbles.  You can call them anytime you want and if it happens in the future, no matter how far down the road it happens, you called it, you're right, have a cookie.
Ask these same people calling bubbles what price should Bitcoin be at for it to not be considered a bubble?  They give you an opinionated guess.  A guess.  There's no reasoned argument.  Mind you, the speculators are no better.  But if you expect anyone that calls a bubble without showing reasoned argument to get upvoted, you're crazy.

Disclosure:  I just started learning TA.  I've made a number of right calls and a couple wrong ones.  I recently sold most of my Bitcoins at 130.
The most important thing is to look for resistances and supports.  These are areas where price action in the past has visited and revisited.  The usual saying is that an area of resistance later becomes an area of support.  Here are the major numbers in my view:
103: This was the previous low during our ascent of lower lows. Breaking this is a very bearish sign.
91-93: This was an area of resistance shortly before the meteoric rise to 266.   
70-80:  This is the major one.  If we continue this downward channel I expect the price will test this range within the next few weeks.  A bounce off here is a good sign, otherwise we're in for some trouble.
It should be no surprise to many that the price moves based on the actions of large players (whales).  Whether they are buying vast amounts of BTC or selling them off, the price moves in the direction they act.  I don't know a good re-entry point because these things are extremely difficult to predict.  Some moves are safer than others, and all you can do is try to minimize risk.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:50:02
It depends on how fast the value shoots up.  I have a vested interest in Bitcoin going upwards of 1000$.  But if that happens too early, you can expect a crash to follow.  It comes down to whether Bitcoin will be appropriately valued at the price it reaches.  
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:09:44

There are a large quantity of 0.02 transactions which really amount to a couple bucks each (basically nothing).  They are staggered at ever increasing or decreasing amounts.

People buying at market price will get "fooled" by these transactions and contribute to the "false" price with transactions of large volume.

@_date: 2013-04-26 00:39:15
Since the upgrades to Gox, one thing has been apparent, you don't need lag to cause the price to drop.  In fact, during high trading volumes, there has been slight lag, 30seconds to 1 minute.  This has occurred both ways, as prices were rising and as prices were dropping.
People will make money from causing panic.  But you don't need lag, and you don't need to spam Gox with trades to do it.

Just cancel your bid and put another up so we can take another 3% from you.

During the April 10th DDoS, Bitcoin had been hugely overbought.  It would have crashed without any DDoS.  When you delay trading, that's all you are doing, delaying trades.  Whatever trend the market would have been going, all you do is delay that trend for a few minutes or hours.

There seems to be a lot of optimism about BTC stocks here, I'll chime in with a different tone.
Making dividends is great and seeing your shares increase in value is awesome.  But make no mistake that you are exposing yourself to a lot of risk.  If you buy into a stock that is overvalued and it tanks, you've lost Bitcoins.  If the company decides to screw you over, you could lose everything.  Ask yourself which of these companies can survive a massive drop in BTC prices or any other unforeseen catastrophe.  What happens when more competing ASIC mining rigs come into play and dividends drop?
Bitcoin is already a highly risky asset to hold, Bitcoin stocks even more so.  Be careful guys.

You're my hero for the day.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:09:19
Okay, thanks for clearing that up.  Guess I never cancelled an order since I thought they took the fee.  Still 3% is excessive, I was there back in the day when it was 0.5 or 0.6.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:28:33
Will it keep rising 10% per week?  If you need to sell off that's another 3% you lose.  6% to go both ways.
This is an exchange that once offered competitive rates (0.5%) and changed it once they realized they had the highest volume for CDN$. With the recent surge in Bitcoin prices, the volume structure is absurd.
Just because you are making gains, you should still see where you are being robbed.

Read up on optimal virulence.  A virus that kills its host will have more difficulty transmitting to other hosts.  There's a tradeoff between virulence and fitness in many pathogens. 
The analogy,  which I did not start,  but fits rather well,  is that Bitcoin could grow too big for its own good (ie.  Overvalued due to rabid manic speculation)

Those volumes are pennies, how do you expect to manipulate a market with pennies?  These are simply trading algorithms playing off each other, nothing to see here.  Also, since the upgrades, MtGox has been able to handle this.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:44:17
Bitcoinium is pretty good.  You can set price alerts on different exchanges (MtGox, Virtex, BTC-e, etc...). I had to turn my price alarm off during March because the price kept going up.

Leave predictions of the future to psychics and mystics.  Here, we buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:25:17
This is actually the most foolish thing to do as a criminal.  Anyone doing this would now be holding onto the most watched and followed Bitcoins on the blockchain.  Authorities could relentlessly follow those Bitcoins.  In a sense, they are marked bills.

Technophobic old men.

This question gets asked regularly at every price increase.  Up to now, the correct answer has always been a resounding yes.  If you buy now, you could be the guy that got in at around 150, and later it's in the 200s.  Alternatively, you could be the guy that got in at 150 right before it dropped to 50.
There is no doubt that this is a risky investment.  Do your research and make your own conclusions.

Not really, watch the other Bloomberg videos about Bitcoin, she is usually asking the "better" questions and is not completely dismissive of Bitcoin.  She certainly knows more about Bitcoin than the majority of other journalists.

I love that this is going to be the new thing to say. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:11:03
Short answer: I don't know.
I don't normally pay attention to oscillators, but the RSI on 12hour and 1day timeframes is showing oversold conditions for the first time this year.  Could be a sign of the bottom but don't rely on single indicators.  
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:27:16
Yeah, the system really should be able to cancel orders that are pending immediately.

Napster is dead.  Successors took over.  This could happen with Bitcoin as well.  The genie may be out, but this may not be the thing that takes over.  In any case, I'll hit you up in two months, and admit if you called it or make fun of you if you were horribly wrong.

It seems like the interviews are intended to get a sense if there is a connection or not.  My bet is the same as yours, it probably had no direct influence on Bitcoin adoption (ie. very few people who had money in Cyprus banks moved them into Bitcoin).  Nevertheless the events coincided and the reporting of it likely led to increased adoption elsewhere.  So, indirectly, events in Cyprus probably had some impact on Bitcoin adoption through increased media reporting.

Highest volume Canadian exchange.  Also insanely high fees.

Are you saying there's no way of designing something like Bitcoin without giving early miners a disproportionate advantage to late adopters?  Was it a necessity to design it this way?

The major issue is that it can't be removed.  If it was placed there with the intention of distribution, this is problematic.

The amazing features of cryptocurrencies are unlikely to change, and even if they do, it will be for the better.  However, when you invest in a cryptocurrency, you are not necessarily betting on its fundamentals, but whether people will start using it.  That's why Bitcoin is a better investment over the other cryptocurrencies.  But this leaves Bitcoin at the mercy of its users and potential users - it can certainly be over valued if people are not using it.

"But the power of the masses is only shrinking.  BitCoin made a technical choice during its initial design that allowed some people to do far more work than others, simply by having a graphical accelerator or even by designing custom hardware.  This is the precise capability that large financial actors and nation states have above and beyond the private sector’s capacity to produce, and it’s not obvious that even the BitCoin developers have the political ability to override a technical choice that would also harm the technology’s largest (public) players.
I provide these details to make it clear – the BitCoin experiment is not complete, there is actually quite a bit of interesting work to be done and it’s not at all clear what the future holds for the technology."
He may not have been able to hack it, but he does express some of the common concerns.

What I gather is, if you are trying to mask a huge sum of Bitcoins, it is going to be extremely difficult to pull off.  But if this is small amounts, it will be extremely tedious to trace.

You need it to be in more and more hands for it to eventually be attractive to businesses. More Bitcoin users is a good thing.  If the side effect is increasing Bitcoin value, so be it.

Meh, I've heard worse.  It wasn't that bad,  Colbert asked the right questions for the uninitiated.  The NPR guy didn't seem to know a whole lot,  but we can't hate on people just because they are giving cautious advice.
