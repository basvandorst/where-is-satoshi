The option to buy is now there, but it's disabled for a little bit.

So few options to buy in Australia. These are the only three I have been able to get use out of, and they're all kinda balls.

Is Christmas bonus a big thing in America? I've always associated it with holiday movies, but never twigged. No Christmas bonus for me in Aussie land.

And the answer is always "not enough"

The Aussie big bash T20 comp started the other day, if you can find a stream there is a game on at the moment. For anyone who hasn't seen it before, T20 is the easiest format to pick up. Much shorter format and designed for everyone to have a bit of fun, but still a serious comp. 
I'll dig up some vids. 
Current match stream - 
Oldie but a goodie - India v Australia 2001 ( test match) - 
South Africa v Australia - highest ever score, followed by the highest ever score again to win -
 
Chris Gayle from the West Indies dominating - 
I play and record the games I play in very low level cricket if you want to see the skill difference!
