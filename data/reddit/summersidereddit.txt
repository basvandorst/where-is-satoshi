I advise you to do a real bitcoin trade, where it gets mined in the blockchain.  right now if you were sending a 5$ mining fee it would take about 40 minutes to get mine (confirm the trade). when you trade on an exchange, there is hundred of transactions per minutes. the FULL capacity of the blockchain is about 250k trade a day. if they were to buy and sell each bitcoin of there underlying transaction, you would be waiting for dayssss to see a bitcoin on your account. the major part of all exchange transactions or not in the blockchain.
so no, they don't have your bitcoins. they have a 'reserve' of bitcoins but that's it. 
here is a good one for you: if you own 10 bitcoin on let say coinbase.com, and then there is a fork (like Bitcoin Cash) do you think you would also have 10 bitcoins in that fork? 
when you ask for your bitcoin transfer, they buy the bitcoin / take them in there reserve and send it to you, which creates a real bitcoin transaction. you will have to pay a mining fee + wait the normal time but most people keep there bitcoin in those account, which make no sense to me.

Jameson has a very good approach with Ver, he knows how not to make him go crazy which result in a decent argument between the   two!

there is 3 possible scenario here:
1. Institutional investor that has been pilling up on bitcoin might want to unwind there 'cash' position by buying the future and selling there real bitcoin on the current exchanges. why would you want to do this you say? well its pretty simple, futures only need a very small margin which allows you to use better leverage, also they are very easy to monetize vs the current terrible bitcoin ecosystem for large stake. Anyone with a significant amount of bitcoin in exchanges websites not doing this trade is a foul. This would be terrible, since 'real' bitcoin transaction per day is very limited, this kind of unwind would probably kill some major exchange if large position are trying to cash out.
2. Institutional investor that are late to the party are waiting for future to join hype and buy future which would probably offset the massive cash unwind, in this scenario the price would probably move up by a significant amount.
3. Nothing happens business as usual (highly unlikely)
strap on, this is going to be interesting.

what do you think all those exchanges website are doing? you think they actually trade the bitcoin?

it's just crazy to me. Jameson is telling him what problem BTC/BCH will face and the only answers are 'the miner will decide'
