Youtube. I can't remember the channel and I would link but I'm on mobile. There's a channel that does gdax tutorials

Right - Localbitcoins is one website compared to thousands.... Coinbase is located in NY..... Just like how Bitfinex is no longer doing service with the U.S - Localbitcoins is no longer doing service with NY. 
Your worrying me bro but hey, good luck.

If you need some visuals - heres a couple of youtube videos that helped me out.

Yea - I agree. Idk why people just don't use google and type "reddit" at the end of their question because its been asked hundreds of time. There should be a subreddit for that
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:51:16
Aw man. I don't feel regret. I just regret my actions around the time. I got my refund check in like 2011 - I knew about bitcoin at the time. I knew it was going to blow up like its blowing up now but not in this magnitude. I decided I wanted instant gratification and decided to spend that check on drugs instead of buying in bitcoin when it was less than a dollar.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:43:04
..... right in the feels..
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:42:37
Lol - to do what? Is it illegal to buy bitcoin in NYC?!? Lol - no.
As far as day trading - I wouldn't, if you don't know what your doing lol - youll get rekt. I spent like 300 hours just trying to educate myself these past months before making my first trade.

[bitcointicker.co]( has marjority of the exchanges listed
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:35:22
Just make sure you keep records of all your purchases and sales. It's not too hard to work out how much to declare when it comes to tax season.
You will have to pay capital gains on the profit you make when you sell or trade bitcoin for something
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:21:27
Because the exchanges are not interconnected 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:10:15
Good idea if your going to be trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:22:56
are you trading or just buying bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:44:42
Yea its safe- make sure you have 2FA on too
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:35:27
Damn, where'd you get that number? All the corrections have been about 20-30%. I don't think we will ever see bitcoin as a 4 digit price.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:45:27
Whats next is up to you. Better question to ask your self is what is your end goal- to obtain a bitcoin? to make some money? hold? 
BTW - look into GDAX, its coinbase but the exchange version. You can buy more LTC / ETH / BTC and avoid paying fees.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:52:44
Thanks! This answers alot!
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:54:32
Right, but how much? Is there a bracket system?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:49:12
Check your emails for confirmation of sign up if it's not the Mtgox.. hope that helps!
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:25:28

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:49:54

@_date: 2017-11-16 20:57:10
Where the audio at?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:55
I just panicked sold lol. that last candle was scary
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:50:52
Buying in small increments will be okay. unless you teach yourself how to trade :D
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:19:34
Mind if I ask if you buying/selling/trading and what platform you used to make the transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:03:13
Lol, now that I've read that out loud. Yes, pretty ridiculous lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:35:05
Supply and Demand. The exchanges are not interconnected. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:55:19
Congrats yo!
Mind if I ask how you got there? Like did you trade bitcoin to build up to 1 or did you just purchase it?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:44:08
Another fork? Damn, I'm all new to this. How often does this happen? lol
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:33:35
Thanks for the info. One last semi stupid question. Let's say I started trading bitcoin. Day 1 I make a profit. Day 2 and 3 I don't do anything. But day 4 I reinvest again. Would I still have to pay for day 1 profit even if I had taken that money and bought more on day 4?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:33:46
ELI5: whats bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:47:27
Capital Gains Tax. pretty sure you still have to report it any profit you make. I asked a [similar question]( not too long ago.
