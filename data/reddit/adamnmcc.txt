i just bought the Ledger Nano Strap edition. 
I'm already using Mycelium to keep my Coins off exhanges or centralised services, but i worry about losing my phone and as such, my coins. It was so easy to set up and transfer coins to. One copy is now at home in a safe and the other is in my laptop bag.. 
So, Thanks for an awesome product!

i got bored of having a blank holding page on my server at home so i created this!

the only problem with that scheme is that you need a static IP. 
i have 100mb Fibre but i get a dynamic IP so the scheme is useless to me.

Bit of a flawed hunt if the hunters can ruin the entire treasure hunt for other people.

Can you give us a reason why its down? this is some major downtime and we're currently stumbling around in the dark as to why?

I have friends out there who were very lucky to be alive. They are also very lucky to be able to come home if they need to. Please accept this to help those that cannot.

Touché sir.

I'm guessing having a dynamic IP isn't really going to work for this. every time i get a new IP i'm going to have to wait a week to get a decent PIX score. :(

I've followed the instructions found [here]( and it fixws my problem. apparently its an outdated version of python on OSx.
