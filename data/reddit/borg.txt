I don't know what you mean by 'payment processors'. Newegg and TigerDirect use Bitpay to facilitate taking Bitcoin payments. BitPay charges the merchants a fee to do this. That fee is smaller than Visa and MasterCard charge for the same transaction. 
Most of the fees that trust based networks like Visa charge are due to fraud. Their profit is a small percentage of that fee. 
Your argument makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:35:46
Bitcoin users probably want more of what I experience when I buy from Newegg or TigerDirect using Bitcoin. I get confirmation almost instantly, a checkout page that updates my payment as I watch and behind the scene a small fee paid to include my transaction in the current block.
If blocks are full, Bitcoin users won't get this experience. If you want Bitcoin to grow and function as a payment network, it has to be inclusive. SW is months away and blocks are full now. This whole 'debate' is bizarre.

The blocksize limit will be raised in the near future (within 1 month). It's how the blocksize limit gets raised that is the issue here. Either Core raises its limit or there is an open revolt leading to a widespread adoption of XT/Unlimited. If the latter occurs, the centralization, ie. Blockstream dominance, will never happen again. So, either the can gets kicked down the road while a more permanent solution is developed or Core ceases to wield the power that it currently enjoys.

If a user wants to transact on the blockchain and they pay for the transaction why wouldn't they be allowed to? Are you suggesting that any transaction using the blockchain for a reason other than payment is spam? If so, and actual payments are limited to 3 Tps until SW and then 7 Tps until LN comes into being, that's ridiculous.

Margins for those guys are pretty thin already. I've heard that credit card transaction fees sap half of a typical online retailers profit margin. If they go to 10% discount, they lose money. Yes, Bitcoin would take off if people got a 50% discount when using it. But even convincing a retailer to lose money at all to promote a currency that isn't profitable to them isn't going to happen.

Bitpay has maybe 20k merchants,  Coinbase is getting active in that space and there are others. Aside from the 3600 new BTC generated through mining, every purchase with BTC gets sold on a market by a Bitpay-like co. So, it could be 4k x $800 = $3.2M in new fiat every day that has to get into an exchange just to keep the price where it is.

No they have zero incentive for it and this is the problem. If Bitcoin became more widespread, the retailers could pay their suppliers in Bitcoin and maybe even pay part of their employee salaries with Bitcoin, the savings would be substantial, but for Bitcoin to gain traction, there has to be a compelling reason for consumers to go through the non-zero learning curve and unless there is financial incentive, widespread adoption isn't right around the corner.
Note, this conversation is only for consumers and not for the remittance market,  which has huge advantage over traditional methods.

Most of your bullet points are justification for the top 2. So, I'll just address those, assuming some combination of the others led to these 2 being enforced.
1) Inability of big government to collect taxes - therefore governments will declare owning it a crime, an attempt to launder money. Like buying seeds of certain plants is a crime.
This is a long, long time in the future. If Bitcoin has grown so big that governments consider outlawing it to facilitate tax collection, what do you think 1 Bitcoin would be worth? If you have something that can be kept securely by printing out a 64 character alpha-numeric string, and storing/hiding it, how can anyone take that from you? When something so valuable is driven underground does it lose its value?
2) The Banking Cartel will buy the influence they need to utterly destroy the bitcoin market, and regulate it so heavily, bitcoin will lose it's advantages of easy "legal" transmission.
Regulation can only be effective when there is centralized control of value. In Bitcoin's case, that means at the IO ports, ie. exchanges where fiat is transferred to Bitcoin and vice-versa. The exchanges do off the blockchain transactions so ultimately there are a few individuals with an ability to steal. Provable reserves would go a long way to stop it, in fact that is one of the few regulations I actually support. If Lawsky wanted, or cared, about doing it right, that's the only regulation he'd have.
In fact, here Ben; NY will allow exchanges to operate within the geographical limits of NY state, forgetting for a moment how ridiculous that concept is, if they have a daily, automatic, public, provable reserve check in place. The rest of the document is probably not absorbent enough for the only other useful application.
There can also be a requirement for businesses that accept Bitcoin to track customers who pay in Bitcoin. This can be a way to tie an identity to a public address. If governments really want to reduce the usefulness of Bitcoin, this is one way to  do it.
Another point of regulation is the mining community. How many large mining operations are there? Can they be identified? Can they be forced to register as a special business somehow? This might temporarily reduce the power of the network but if small, independent mining becomes profitable again, is that such a bad thing?
The Bitcoin network itself can't be regulated out of existence, but the usability can be lessened, the anonymous nature can be attacked and the mining power that secures the network can be regulated.
There are technological solutions to these problems, and tech always wins in the end over greed and desire for control. If Openbazaar takes off, that and Darkwallet alone make Bitcoin an almost unstoppable force.

I don't see why this is a mystery. When people have a financial incentive to learn about and use Bitcoin, they will. When people can reliably go online and save 10% by using Bitcoin, their friends will make them feel stupid for not using it..

It's a fantastic  technology, no doubt about that and when you're over the fence it really does feel like the future. But the barrier to entry is non-zero. We're  asking people to think and learn about something new. If we could point to real savings, we could motivate them. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:49:17
How about recording the local currency Bitcoin price at the time of sale, then explaining to the customer that a return when the Bitcoin value is lower than the time of purchase yields the amount in Bitcoins, while a return when the Bitcoin price is higher yields the local currency. 
No customer would profit by using you as an exchange and the product value wouldn't decrease while the return policy is in effect.

Douchebag just sounded a little hipster this AM and I would never accuse a stranger of that!!
If it's hard to get, and it has been very difficult, there just have to be strong incentives to influence someone to make the leap. I know there are many good reasons for unbanked and people who need a cheap way to do remittance to  adopt Bitcoin but if someone showed a way to carve 10% or even 5% off their monthly expenses it would give enough motivation to learn about it. 
With the possible exception of Overstock, these large companies probably don't give a shit whether or not Bitcoin succeeds.  So they're not inclined to give big discounts to people who pay with Bitcoin. Eventually, there will be DAC's and smart  contracts and Bitcoin might be the only way to play, but to get more consumers on board there has to be a reason other than 'this is a great way to stick it to the man'.

Bitcoin is still like the wild west. For every legit business, there are a dozen scam businesses. It's a magnet for the unsavory and that is preventing mainstream adoption more than anything else.
That said, using it with Overstock, for example, or Tigerdirect, is an absolute joy.  It's fast, secure and it feels like transacting in the 21st century.
Bitcoin needs a rebranding. It works much, much better than the fiat/credit card clusterfuck that is presently used but there is so much scam bullshit surrounding Bitcoin that it's either going to take a 2 way pegged equivalent or years before mainstream adoption takes place.

My point is, Bitcoin will take off if and when it becomes financially profitable for Western users to learn about it and get some. If the companies who currently accept Bitcoins gave even a 5% discount to Bitcoin paying customers there would be immediate mainstream adoption in the West.
I do think that eventually Bitcoin will fulfill much of the promise you allude to. That might happen in 2015 and it might be a few years out but if there were a real, concrete reason for people to come home after a long day at work and learn about Bitcoin rather than watch whatever the latest televised shit is on, Bitfcoin would take off next week.

And how long do you figure that will take. Let's say just raising throughput by a factor of 4 takes us through summer and a further increase to 8 gets us all the way through summer of 2017. Meanwhile, the layer-2 solutions are under construction. I look at the whole blocksize issue as one where buying time for a permanent solution could be easily accomplished, or rather could have been easily accomplished if it weren't for Maxwell's giant ego. Now things are pretty fucked up. We have multiple clients that will compete for chain length and the winner gets the prize of figuring out how to really scale the thing. The good news is that Bitcoin might grow for another couple more years before it implodes.


The point is, if Bitcoin doesn't reach a tipping point it won't matter what tps it eventually has. Earlier you asked me what alt would win. I have no idea but if Bitcoin stops being useful it isn't going to have mainstream adoption no matter how pretty and shiny LN is.


I don't think you understand me. I'm for layer-2 solutions but these things take time. To get from here to there, we have to keep the usefulness of the network front and center. That means increasing throughput as quickly and efficiently as we can and I'm not talking about telling the community to wait 4 months for SegWit.
Unfortunately, now there is going to likely be more schism, more competing clients and more chaos before things improve. It didn't need to happen like that.
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:53:13


But why disregard short term fixes while working long term problems? All of this conflict  could have been avoided if a simple increase to blocksize  was implemented 6 months ago. That could have been done easily and no competing clients would ever have come forward. As it is now, much of the Bitcoin community harbors a deep resentment of any Blockstream influence whether real or imagined.


I wonder how much transaction growth is speculative. I can go to a few computer shops online and make real purchases  and if I search I can find things to buy online but the growth in terms of real world merchants is very minimal. There is just not enough incentive for an ordinary person in the western world to throw away their credit cards. Now Core wants users to compete for space in small blocks. How does that create financial incentive for  increased adoption?


The rate of technological progress is such that transactional throughput won't be limited by present day limitations in networks or computer equipment. If transactional throughput can increase with adoption, who is to say that it can't ever be a strength? 2 or 3 yrs from now, your smartphone is going to be obsolete. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:06:51


Today, 1 MB blocks are full. Bitcoin is not anywhere near mainstream. It's a technology that shows promise. If it can't scale, an altcoin will take its place. If the blocksize can grow as Bitcoin grows it will be perceived to scale. The object now should be to grow usage while at the same time working on solutions to long term problems. If those long term problems continue to dominate short term thinking, Bitcoin will never grow. Focusing effort on things like development of a fee market and LN is a sure way to guarantee that it won't ever get there.
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:21:58


We disagree on two points here. The hardcore bigblockists might scream but the average interested bitcoiner would be able to look at blockchain.info and see that there was still plenty of transaction space  in each block. Their argument would then lose immediacy. The second thing we disagree on is that I'm not convinced that a simple gradual increase wouldn't allow a degree of scalability. It, simply increasing blocksize, doesn't have to be the ultimate final answer. It just has to get us to where a more final answer can be dropped in. LN sounds like it could be a  very strong scalability solution but asking people to trust the Core developers while they work on it and not implementing simple fixes in the meantime is ludicrous.


The reason there is a limit to block size is prevention of DDoS attacks. Otherwise, an unlimited blocksize would be fine. The actual size of blocks is set by individual miners and won't grow without bound for the simple reason that another miner will solve PoW first on a smaller block. The incentive is for blocks to be as small as  possible. 
As for Moore's law limitations, the article makes some valid points, physics does tend to impose its own laws. I'm not a semiconducter guy and I can't propose solutions for Intel.  However, I think peak oil people were surprised by fracking and horizontal drilling. The automotive industry has gotten by on iterative improvements for a hundred years and then Musk comes along and flips everything on its head. The rate of progress isn't going to slow down drastically for very long. I haven't read up on quantum computing but it's possible that could step in and make Moore's law itself obsolete.


I have no idea what you're talking about here. Please enlighten me.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:24:19
I read the Agners piece and much of the relevant comments in and I'm still going to say that the rate of technological progress is not going to slow down indefinitely. Don't bet against further increases in speed and power. Whether that comes from novel compiler design or a new way to cool a 3D processor or, likely, something neither of us has thought of. 
If you're saying, we shouldn't do something as fundamental as increasing throughput by a factor of 2 or 4 while we work on a long term fix because todays tech runs into problems when we increase it by a factor of 32, that's just crazy.
comment is a great read. His main problem with allowing Bitcoin to function, temporarily, as a payment network is that each incremental improvement to utility decreases the ultimate value of Bitcoin. I'm not convinced this is the case.
What the system needs now is to get more people on board. If more people are attracted to it's payment network like utility, short term, then so be it. The layer-2 stuff that's coming will be a seamless change to them. But today, mainstream people just look at Biitcoin and see complexity that they don't have time for. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 03:22:53


We have to get there as a community with a viable valuable transferable token. If Bitcoin  grinds to a halt because it takes an unknowable amount of time to confirm a transaction or if it's too expensive to use, LN and Layer-2 solutions will be too little too late.


That's exactly what  I'm doing and I'm right about it.  You cannot find any single area where our freaking species hasn't made mind boggling advances in technology in the past, not just linear advances but exponential. In 5 years, provided we don't blow ourselves up, computers will be significantly faster and more powerful than they are today. What, do you think we're going to bump up against Moore's law limitations and then throw  up our hands and say, 'Gee that was fun, now what'?


Yes but that means it's a store of value and one can transact quickly and efficiently. What I don't understand is your statement'

Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't a hard fork imply a change in repository? For example, if a competing client gets sufficient support to change the longest chain, that client becomes the de facto Bitcoin client. That would mean the competing client now controls the repository of the main client, since it's now the main client. Is this why we are fed a steady diet of 'soft forks are safer'? 
@_date: 2015-11-07 18:22:28

If bitcoin forks, there will briefly be two chains, yes. Miners, who are allergic to lack of profit, will switch to the longest chain immediately. There will be different groups of developers, yes. But the reference client will no longer be the Core client, right? That new client will use its own repository for source code. The Core developers would not have commit access to that new reference client. I think that's the reason soft fork is officially preferred. Maybe I'm wrong about that. But that's my point.
@_date: 2016-05-09 16:43:42
Interesting that there is no mention of blocksize as a short term constraint on growth. As the price appreciates the number of transactions increase. As that happens the network becomes congested and confirmation times slow leading to reduced price. Rinse and repeat until LN works perfectly.

Yes but that's just so a developer can make local changes and test things. After which, his local changes get merged into the 'head' of the code, if his pull request is approved by a guy with commit rights to  the repository.
My point is, and I really want to know if this is true, the blockchain is tied to the git repo. If the longest chain is that of a competing client, that client then becomes the reference client and those developers control the commit access.

IANAE but it seems that fewer people are able to participate in the economy. If economic growth is trickling upward, then recessions and poor job growth will follow. So, my comment about credit cards is especially valid. In the case of credit cards, the high interest rates serve to enrich shareholders at the expense of users of the card. The human nature to prefer immediate gratification is the same with BTC but there is no trickle up effect. Hence the  economy will be healthier. That's my guess anyway.

I bought some furniture yesterday. If I had wanted to pay the full amount with my credit cards, I couldn't have done it since there is a max allowable amount to charge in one day. Yes, I know that's an effort to combat  fraud. I financed it for 24 months at 0% interest, so I filled out a long form, listed my income sources and submitted to a credit check. I waited 15 minutes or so and got the financing. 
Had the furniture store accepted Bitcoin, I could have scanned a QR code with my Android phone, signed a paper or so and gotten on with my life. The more I use it, the more convinced I am that it will make it.
Having gotten 0% financing for fiat currency that will be worth about 3-5% less at the end of the loan term was nice, rather than paying in a currency that might be worth 10x what it is now but I needed the furniture now, not in 2 yrs. 
I care about being able to spend what's mine without getting anyone's permission.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:26:27
Do you ever use a credit card? Many, many people run a balance every month and the interest rates are several times higher than the inflation rate. People make a choice that they would rather have a good now rather than in the future even though that thing is going to cost them more when it's all said and done. Essentially BTC, the currency, not the payment network, will affect the economy just like credit cards do. You get BTC, the payment network for free.

Bought a Dell XPS 13 from bitcoinstore, bought a domain from EasyDNS and reupped 3 months of VPN from AirVPN. That's in the past 2 weeks.

You buy based on need. If you're hungry today and have BTC to spend on food, it doesn't matter whether your expectation is that the BTC will appreciate. If you don't need an item, merely want it, say a new TV, there's a tradeoff that you must go through.
The end result is that TV manufacturers will compete to tip the scales toward a person foregoing currency appreciation.
The really interesting effect is that people will be dissuaded from buying things that will end up in a landfill in 3 months.

Banks = expensive, slow and inconvenient.
Bitcoin = cheap, fast and convenient.

If you have a system with 90% of the wealth held by 10% of the people,  it is much less efficient than the same money distributed more equitably. If 70% were controlled by the top 10%, the extra 20% is likely to be spent, contributing to real demand. The argument that the wealthy would invest in job creation has been thoroughly debunked. 
My comments regarding BTC vs Credit Cards are a perfect example. Bitcoin holders are no more likely to forgo purchases, even wants rather than needs, than a typical card holder. The difference is that wealth will be more equally distributed. 
Five minutes of thought will convince you that it's demand that greases the wheels of an economy and the more discretionary income people have, the more likely they are to spend. A wealthy person already has his needs, and more, met. They might invest excess money but the economy in general must be driven by demand for goods and services. If that demand comes from a larger segment of the population, the economy will be healthy.
