There is nothing democratic about the banking system, yeah.. this is why we Bitcoin.

They can deny a transaction if it is deemed risky. Algorithms are codified prejudice.
I've had a lot of issues with that bank, but I've never had a problem sending fiat to bitstamp, but last I did that was 2013.
They do however harass me when I try to withdraw more than 20k EUR a pop. Something something terrorist financing..
Fucking wankers.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:47:51
It kinda defeats the purpose of being simple enough that anyone can understand it.

From many years ago? 
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:13:31
This guy gets it!
But I wouldn't say cash is usable in any important way. Transactions above 5000 EUR (~50000 SEK) are illegal in Sweden. Cash is worthless here, you cannot even pay taxes in it.
Any useful freedom respecting cashlike system would also be incompatible with the 4th money laundering/anti terrorism directive, as implemented by Sweden.
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:13:25
This is the opposite of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Knots created in a hardfork? Author doesn't seem to know what they're talking about.
Hardforks are about implementing different consensus rules, breaking off from Bitcoin the consensus network! Bitcoin Core is a client implementing those rules.
Everything is just confusing and weird....

This is good for Bitcoin right? Right guys? Guys..
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:12:46
Same in Bitcoin, if you have lots of dust/change in your UTXOs :) people will accept it, but transaction fees are higher.
@_date: 2018-09-23 09:34:47
Right, of course!
@_date: 2018-09-12 21:49:19
Yes very easy, but my point stands.
@_date: 2018-09-23 08:17:34
How can you rebalance a channel off-chain? Anyone has any more information about this?
@_date: 2018-09-11 05:03:33
It's totalitarian. Are you OK with that?
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:07:29
It increases risk, so it's not diversifying.
Spreading risk is like driving faster, remove your seatbelt, letting go of the steering wheel to tie the blindfold.
Ok, we all hate car analogies, sorry :)
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:24:03
@_date: 2018-09-23 08:22:17
This was very bad, but given the options, it had the least bad outcome.
Are you satisfied with that answer?
What do you mean with evil banks? This is a bug in the software which could affect the integrity of a few high value blockchains, focus on that problem?
@_date: 2018-09-24 05:47:36
Yes and on top of this we have to realize that distributed cryptocurrencies requires consensus, it can be harder to change than we think and we might not even know for sure what people want.
@_date: 2018-09-26 05:27:54
Yes. Currently the sender needs to know about enough nodes to make a route.

It's 2014 again!
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:37:04

So you are asking r/Bitcoin ...
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:53:17
Looking forward to aggregate signatures, which might enable us to use a few interesting privacy techniques more cheaply :)
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:26:28
Don't approve.
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:31:03
First of all, afaik there's no ASIC-proof algorithm.
Second point is, the algorithm should be as simple as possible, enabling smaller manufacturers to enter the market for miners.
Besides, a GPU mining is producing as much heat and "wasting" as much electricity.
Yeah you're right, the aftermarket is something I hadn't considered. But the GPU market is far harder to enter.
Lots of these little things that irk me about GPU mining :)
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:26:06
I certainly think so. Burning coal is very bad for almost everyone in the whole world.

@_date: 2018-08-12 09:00:11
Yeah, I think I read something like that in the LN whitepaper. 
Smaller improvements such as aggregate signatures or schnorr, MuSig might make these type of contracts smaller.
This is a marathon full of tradeoffs! There are no silver bullets and people should manage their expectations accordingly.

Market cap is bogus. If I get my friend to buy 1 poopiecoin for 1 EUR and I premine 1 trillion poopiecoin, the marketcap is yuge, 1 trillion EUR. 
Does that mean it's worth that much? Shit metric
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:40:46
No one is refusing hardforks, realistically you have to have consensus for them, which is very hard as we've seen. And most are waiting for safer ways to HF.
I also use litecoin from time to time, but I expect sidechains to take that role.
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:45:44
If BTC is mooning people buy it and it moons more, why would I want a safe haven when it's mooning?
This is my expert opinion, as you can tell.

With that math not even onchain can saturate the whole "potential network". Not everything is mined yet and much is lost, burnt or illiquid.

@_date: 2018-05-27 15:20:14
You decide for yourself.
I'm of the opinion that you aren't diversifying if you just buy another cryptocurrency. You are not reducing risk.
Perhaps my logic is stupid, but it has guided me well in terms of feathercoins and namecoins. Shitcoins.

Sounds pretty OK for developing a financial protocol. 
You also have multiple implementations of BOLT. So there are already at least 3 companies with working betas out, and they seem to all work fine!

They are a bit loony, but LN comes with its own trade-offs, just as zero conf, multisig, large/small blocks, sidechains and so on does.

Lowering the blocksize is a useless proposal and not even a serious proposal. If you want to use a checkpoint, do so. No need to change blocksize.
Lowering the blocksize does not change the basic "problem" at all, full sync from genesis.

I'd say most men and women invested in bitcoin are not overly financially literate.
I think it's a combo of culture, risk appetite and tech savvyness.

But now only private banks have access to digital central bank money.
So in my book it would be an improvement.
Cash is also central bank money, but not very fungible in practice because of money laundering laws.

Ehm OK. I just don't see participants in an unprofitable business getting richer than those of us who doesn't play mining.
@_date: 2018-06-07 07:30:55
Plain old optimizations are the best scaling solutions, because we don't sacrifice decentralization, permisionlessness or the non-interactive properties of Bitcoin.
BOLT spec is good, but requires interactive monitoring of your channel status. eltoo is slightly better than LN-penalty in that regard.
But yeah, optimizations rule, because nothing is lost.

0-conf is an agreement between two parties.
RBF is a node policy. Ultimately miners decide what tx goes in a block.
0-fee is impossible because fees prevent spam.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:47:51
In LN the price is lower and confirmations faster, per transaction.
But LN isn't quite ready yet and requires channel funding.

There is a good case for tail-emission, but I doubt bitcoin can reach consensus on the holiest of holy commands.
Tail-emission works the same way even when we've reached the bitcoin endgame (one without coinbase rewards for miners).

All in all, the dude probably saved lives, I'm thinking.
Where I'm from, most deaths are from not knowing what heroin you get. If that is fentanyl cut badly and mislabeled, people die.
Getting your poison from a reputable vendor is harm reduction, saves lives. Ofc people have also died from drugs on SR, but all in all...

So the board isn't decentralized?
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:30:34
Blocks are often larger than 1MB on Bitcoin.
Charlie Lees Litecoin has very large throughput capacity.
Bitcoin developers are not against increasing throughput, this is more about not being wreckless, understanding that you need consensus to make changes and improving decentralization.
I'm sure you have heard about extension blocks and sidechains.
As for the... BCH supporters, fuck em! :)

The blockchain itself is a replicated database, which you can verify by running a full node.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:05:40
The miners might not want to sell for less than it costs to mine it, which would either lead to stopping mining or waiting to sell.
Restricting supply, IF the miners actually wants to do any mining.
Restricting supply leads to more expensive bitcoin.
I dunno, but that is the kind of reasoning from Fundstrat at least.
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:27:42
bad money drives out good
@_date: 2018-06-10 12:57:13
Good approach.
I just hope nodes will want to use this, I guess since transactions to Bitcoin takes around 10 minutes to verify, a few extra time units more worth of propagation time. Node operators perhaps could be ideologically incentivized to do them Dandelion style.. 
But I hate this argument myself, since meta-incentives are prone to bribery in general, I guess it won't hurt and could potentially be very good.
@_date: 2018-06-07 05:28:29
2MB is a long term vision? :)
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:04:10

Yes, or you can purchase incoming capacity with whatever currency you hold. The seller of LN liquidity then does a submarine swap.
It's a hurdle, for sure. But there is no good alternative if the cost of running a node is going to stay low.
You need to run a node to ensure that you got paid, or delegate that trust to someone else who is running a node, or a group of people.

I don't really agree, I wasn't an og like you Cobra but started investing in 2012. And it was pretty clear to me as a software developer that some of these ideas of what Bitcoin supposedly were, was just unrealistic bullshit.
You remember mycelium bitcard? Community ate that shit up, I almost sold everything, but then I realized, ok, Bitcoin might not work like that.
How would it work? Well kinda like a settlement layer, although that term wasn't in our vocabulary back then.

Side note. I've never talked to a Bitcoin developer except Luke who wants to decrease the blocksize, in fact they seem rather surprised the bcashers dug up that old proposal.

It is a super majority decided by the economic majority, not one man one vote, not one hash one vote, it is different as you surely remember from b2x.
They make the blocks, but we all decide which ones are valid, more or less. Because someone is buying those blocks, to change you need to know you can sell them.

I wish you good luck with the outreach. I think it is needed!
Bitcoin doesn't sell itself because there is no self.
IMO all community members should be inclusive and welcoming, and a lot of us are. But social interactions can be messy, there are no guidelines, there is no policy for that.
This subreddit isn't Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core isn't Bitcoin, Satoshi isn't Bitcoin, etc.. they all are.

It is not his narrative. He clearly identifies the issues.
Bitcoin/BCash brand confusion and false marketing.
Bitcoin (blockchain) renamed to Bitcoin Core (blockchain) by the other side.
Blind tribalism all over.
These are the general points and I think they are pretty accurate. His suggestions for solutions are very good.
What he misses are perhaps the various harassment campaigns, but he is himself a victim of that, so his unique personal perspective just is as valuable IMO.

I'm not against a blocksize increase, but it needs to be done in a safe manner and it requires consensus which is not there yet.
@_date: 2019-04-18 18:10:12
Well, by that definition it might be sufficiently scaled then.
@_date: 2019-04-19 13:53:45
Tell em prophet!
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:44:49
There's nothing inherently central planning about larger block capacity. It requires consensus so there is no center in charge of deciding.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:06:18
Yes, exactly my point!
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:42:46
It is a trade-off. *Using Bitcoin* is also verifying that you got paid, which requires running a full node.
If we define scalability in big O notation, we need both highly scalable solutions such as layer 2 and less scalable solutions, such as capacity increase.
You want bigger blocks, so do I, but I'm in no rush until we find a safe way everyone agrees with.
BTC was advertised in all kinds of crazy ways, blow stamps (FUD), free transactions (impossible), mycelium bitcard (lol), anonymous transactions (not yet), SPV proofs, I don't know what to think of all that, sorry.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:50:30
Thanks. Yeah you just gotta hit that upvote button on all the interesting shit you come across :)
@_date: 2019-04-12 04:40:25
I'm not, I think an increase has good properties, but there isn't consensus for change.
I also think it has negative consequences, I also think fees has to be high enough to secure the network.
Consensus determines change, as this and several other discussions prove is, there isn't consensus for change either way. :)
We need to find better way to reach it, better process.

That doesn't sound realistic. Information and research is a free flow of information and who is a researcher, developer or economic user is full of blurry lines.
Roles are fluid and information flows freely.

Schnorr, blocksize increase, FIBRE, smaller incremental optimizations, Segwit (faster hashing, and blocksize increase), Sidechains, perhaps a HF blocksize increase.

@_date: 2018-03-27 11:06:19
Why does it seem like that? 
We are currently seeing a blocksize increase, FIBRE is working wonders for miners and the rest needs to undergo the testing and review we have come to expect from a project of this size.
MAST is also one of the scaling solutions currently being developed.
And yeah, you might have noticed, tx fees are at times even lower than 1 sat/byte.
Id say it's slowly scaling, the fee market even forced a few big players to batch transactions.

From what I can tell, the Eurosystem has a single monetary policy with centralized decision-making in the ECB.
So a national central bank would act more like a council member? 
My country Sweden is outside Eurosystem, but a member of EU, so we have our own monetary policy decided by our central bank.
That might be incorrect, fuck do I know.

Except that IMHO, blockchain without mining or its permissionless properties isnt much use and has been around since the 90s or something.
Where was the hype among bankers then? What unique selling points does it have, if not decentralized? Where and how does that data structure bring any value to their businesses?
And another thing, you cannot value bitcoin like you do a company stock. It is pointless! Besides, your argument still fails, because 1) bitcoin provides value in being able to store and transfer value. 2) Oracle has a pretty huge market cap but provides little value for the economy :)

If the banks don't do these controls, they risk fines.
The situation is really fucked up and I am glad they are no longer holding my fiat hostage.
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:19:37
I agree, you guys rock!
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:43:23
There's gotta be a meme in there!
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:13:15
I do think that, yes. Do you have more information?
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:38:51
Feeling so smart right now.
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:30:52
It misses batching! It is just a shitty shitty chart, sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:56:46
It seems pretty well proven now.
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:35:21
Seals with clubs :)
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:56:41
That was taken care of well, I agree.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:03:53
Incremental improvements are very important, but often overlooked!
Yeah Visa level is hard! Decentralized systems scale poorly in general, but they are extremely secure and immutable.
Scaling doesnt look to me like something you "solve" and then we are done. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:09:35
You have to cycle your pseudonyms, it is simply good opsec.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:48:15
WOW! That was pretty cool.
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:27:10
So is Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:05:47
Mos def.
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:15:09
Seems like a great payment processor
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:18:27
This is key! If I were an exchange Id hire a "tx fee Maestro", who just looks at the mempool all day and picks an appropriate fee, perhaps capped at what they currently have to avoid human error. It would save millions a day!
Such a simple solution, I bet they are tied down by legal or financial dept.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:49:22
This analogy does not hold. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:23:09
Of couse, these are the general mechanisms. That story is pretty new. Even Jihan who announced this "User Activated HardFork" that became Bitcoin Cash, is saying they are different currencies.
They should not lie and confuse. This is a pretty recent narrative, they have just started pumping out.
Sorry I lost my cool now :)
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:22:12
Mining profit should go towards zero.
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:43:53
This is not a religion.
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:20:06
LN uses bitcoin transactions offchain and also onchain transactions. It just does it more effectively.
So to scale you need several methods, not just bigger blocks.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:41:14
Yes but the one who is not following consensus is a whole different cryptocurrency and should not be confused with the real one, because of two reasons, people can lose real money or buy something falsely advertised.
@_date: 2018-03-06 05:37:44
How would you know transaction volume?
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:22:03
If there is money involved they have to save user data.
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:40:08
No way.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:17:12
No, Segwit was the compromise.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:19:37
Credit cards are not all that common in the EU, debit cards are more common.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:29:20

So that's what this is all about! ;)
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:12:56
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:35:57
So you think Bitcoin will fail like TCP/IP?
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:31:58
Ok, good luck with that.
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:26:44
yes alibaba only nodes
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:08:51
The beauty of blockchains is that the nodes in the network kinda do the same thing, BCash forked and is now claiming that never happened, then intentionally mislead new users on bitcoin.com :(
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:19:37
Cash has good properties, widely accepted, no fractional reserve, can use one for years without charging, offline support, good UI.

@_date: 2018-03-06 06:26:32
Yes, but the chart is wrong.

How do you bet on something stable?
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:08:22
Great work team! It was well worth the 1 BTC:)
Edit: I see people are downvoting, but I was not being sarcastic. That 1 BTC has kept 100s BTC safe from theft.
@_date: 2018-03-12 05:48:55
LN is not ready yet.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:47:58
So like, yeah.. Good point or something ;)
@_date: 2019-01-14 07:03:43
I'm honestly more worried by centralized mining.
Nice effort and write up of your thoughts though!
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:18:55
Dude3, ok
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:27:23
Nice logic there Lopp.

@_date: 2018-02-06 04:57:25
Yes, but I have my solution ready now, ready to save millions a day. I know quite a lot about Bitcoin and worse is better. :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:03:07
Yeah I feel pretty damn sad for him too, until I remember that he is basically paying people to harass Bitcoin developers, lying to new users and saying they never even forked (wtf!) when Bitmain launched BCash.
Im not gonna mention details about his history, I dont give a shit about that, the things he is doing now is just a huge waste of everybodys time!
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:19:46
You mean Bitcoin ABC?
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:38:13

Relax people.

Venezuela and Russia wants to get around sanctions, this might be their way.
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:14:58
So, does that mean multisig?
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:32:29
Burn the witch!
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:12:09
I dont see how.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:41:34
I've been around for long, I am not worried. Bitcoin goes up and Bitcoin goes down!
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:41:13
Dumb money
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:13:46
If you are paying the average you are overpaying. There is no hand hodling in decentralized permissionless systems! 
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:35:37
Looks like the worst kind of amateurs.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:14:51
And this is the reason we need programs such as these.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:45:06
Sure thing.
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:38:34
Yeah! It is perhaps not ideal in that sense.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:45:37
Dumb money.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:54:31
Should honestly be a natural piece of every diversified investment portfolio.

Yeah, so we have some kind of misquote going on here and everyone is upset.
Very upset

I do know what it means, I'm just trying to figure out if you know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:14:00
Is verifying signatures easier with a 1GB block or a 2MB block?
Yes, they are sent in both.
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:25:01
It depends on the denomination :)

I know you can, and you can run an LN node even if someone would say it requires KYC.
Did you not get my point, just came to argue?
@_date: 2018-07-29 09:21:28
RBF is a node policy. Use whatever node policy you want on your node, but don't force me to validate every coffee purchase in the world on my node.
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:44:13
I never claimed that it was. Btw are you downvoting me?
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:40:45
I think we need to remember where we came from :)
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:09:19
Yeah, it's the smart thing to do.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:48:28
This conversation is not heading the way you want it to go. Sorry if I cannot follow along.

LN has UX problems but also potential UX benefits compared to other transactions.
As for the question if I "really think Bitcoin will reach mass adoption if we implement feature X?".
Nope, mass adoption might not even happen IMO and if it does, it will be because of various properties. Feature X, Y, Z, and so on.
The world is chaotic and you have to use quantum thinking (or whatever you gonna call it), to make sense of the infinite possibilities that together make up the future.
Look at what Bitcoin is, look at the key properties that sets it apart from other forms of money, identify niche areas where a subset of properties will thrive, analyze its effect. How would this adoption affect key properties, how would changing protocol parameters affect key properties?
My answer to your first question is yes, we will have problems.
@_date: 2019-09-07 10:15:27
If you think BTC will go up every day, then why would you trade every day?
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:00:40
Both these things you say?
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:58:34
It's called risk.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:17:43


This definition is absolutely useless if you are going to have an actual conversation with a European.
Example: You mean military spending? Then dont call that socialism. It becomes impossible to even have a discussion. :)

What really bugs me about

I don't think they want you back.
@_date: 2019-09-14 11:09:08
Facebook could just partner with a country and all those words and even special taxes means nothing.
Same with Bitcoin, if a sovereign nation would adopt it, things would look different.
@_date: 2018-07-07 20:34:39
Bun-a while since that meme. Fuck that was lame.

@_date: 2018-07-08 08:53:47
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:50:36
I agree. There could be some friction in verifying the account though.
@_date: 2018-07-20 07:18:15
Most people use Google Play and App store, which was my point.
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:49:05
It might have a smaller attack surface.
@_date: 2019-09-09 07:48:03
Sweden is a very safe country. My town of Stockholm has become less safe since 2010, and I have many criminal friends who's been killed during the past two decades.
But Sweden is very safe. There are less safe areas with problems of their own, but as someone who remembers the biker wars of the 90s, it is not organized crime doing the shooting. 
You are obviously very angry about something. Probably immigration (somewhat related) and feminism (not at all related). Immigrants (male) are always more criminal, Finns and Yugoslavians were more criminal in the 80s and 90s, these days not so much.
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:01:46
So if my math is correct you got into Bitcoin in 2010? Congratulations!
@_date: 2018-07-29 09:29:23
Dude is an official.
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:17:21
What if the petrodollar collapses? All these so called limits of BTC growth go poof.
Broaden your view, we are competing in terms of money here.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:43:43
Just do the math.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:58:21
I hope you are doing OK!
@_date: 2018-07-01 09:11:49
What are the facts, please help me?
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:06:06
I just never argue past a certain limit. If one of the sides are not willing to listen, I ignore whatever argument we had and talk about other topics from that point on.
Even if I don't wanna listen, I just ignore and move on.
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:15:33
Good points but that will be considered an attack on Bitcoin, and I don't say that about many things.
@_date: 2018-07-16 06:24:00

It generates traffic which generates views which generates ad money.

Nice cow though.
@_date: 2018-07-10 05:51:11
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:37:05
That's my point, it can go very much higher than you said. Just look at the boliviar/BTC pair!
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:20:58
Nothing to add, I agree, but AML is AML and the appstore/play just has to do what the politicians say.

Don't worry, if there's nothing to freak out about, people will make something up!

Just do your research and don't spend money on anything you don't understand.

That is true, but I don't want to increase space just to enable some kind of blockchain message board.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:58:57
They are important if you care about decentralization. Everything is connected when it comes to protocol consensus and there are always opinions, ranging from technical, philosophical or even for personal taste to some extent.
Just like with every important decision.
So.... Why are you here?

What everyone else said plus a lot of bad blood!

Keep up your good work.
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:54:39
Correct, LN is not the be all and end all solution.
Lots of fine optimizations coming up! Not as extravagant as LN, but each bit helps!

So having one developer is ok because goat farmers can run an SPV node?
Oh the nonsense Rick.
And btw has he never heard of email spoofing or just how crappy email works in regards to privacy, security, etc. All important when dealing with actual money.
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:02:16
Or we stick to the definition: not in X right now, where BCH has only 0.2MB blocks
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:25:25
Yes, I remember :)
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:37:24
You still need to confirm and check fees on a display. You could however verify the LN node destination address, by NFC transfer. So the shop isnt hijacked.

Segwit is such a minor bugfix, I seriously dont care how the blocks are serialized.

We will reach Moore's Law, and pass it, much faster. Resulting in an increased miner lifespan and better decentralization of hashing power.
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:40:42
As far as I know it doesnt work without either hybrid, checkpointing or centralized controller.

Im pretty tipped about that.

Stop. Shilling. Shit.
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:54:41
I know, it fixes tx malleability and in its current form increases block capacity by around 2x.
It should have been a minor upgrade but trolls made it seem like a complete rehaul of everything Bitcoin stands for.
It is exactly a bugfix IMO.

How can you have no fees without spam and centralization?
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:40:43
I am sure there are ways to make money here. More than just altruistically opening channels and offering dirt-cheap fees.
Nothing wrong with that if you are a user yourself, but I'm sure there's a way to strategically position yourself where liquidity is needed, then let the market find a price for that sweet new route of yours. If you are gonna move bitcoin from cold storage, I mean.
I'm excited!

It is not a religion.
But well, yes. But the path to that looks different for different people. And it is uncharted territory in many ways.
And you cannot actually buy anything of importance with bitcoin yet, and there are tax issues.
So if you end up with 90% of riches in bitcoin and is piss poor IRL, who are you to say you cannot cash out, pay taxes and buy a house for the family?
That is also a usecase for currency.

What if you record it and then do a coin flip if you are going to either listen to the tape or burn it?
Did it make a sound?
What if you have two identical recording devices one is empty and you flip a coin which one is going to "record" before you place it?
At what time does it make a sound in each scenario? What if I play a recording back a second time, is the tree making the sound, the brain or the device?
If no one sees the tree falling, did it fall?

I thought the euro could do it for a while, but that does not seem likely in yet a few decades. In the 80's people probably thought that about the yen.
I think the best contender is something the IMF cooks up, kinda like a Bancor, but they will have to make a deal with the US.
Bitcoin is a contender for sure, but currency is the most powerful concept we have, they will not give up without a fight.
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:20:11
It does not remove the signature from the block. It just puts it in a slightly different order. 
It also includes code to deal with that slightly different order.

LN needs loop in/out type services and a whole commercial service infrastructure to become easier to use.
Exchanges, merchants and other participants will hopefully grow a healthy network with distributed liquidity in channels.
It is needed to get good capacity in channels, submarine swap type technology will help immensely.
Establishing more channels in both directions is the next logical step for the LN infra.
@_date: 2019-05-01 20:13:37
It would mean easier taxes for me.

You say you have experience, but you think Lamborghini memes are real.
You talk about Greece, but the euro is still above zero.
Then there's this average Joe guy you're talking about, ignoring the complexities of market actors and capital controls in relation to Bitcoin being borderless.
Your big question is if Bitcoin is a greater fools game. You don't see any value in Bitcoin and you probably never will, unless you actually learn what it is.
This sounded very harsh and I am aware I come off as somewhat of a douchebag, but your post triggered me in every way possible.
As for the answer to price, no clue my friend! I am deeply invested and trying to sell as much as the traditional banking system allows.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:20:12
Yes! And that requires longer miner hardware lifetime, which will come with depletion of Moore's Law.

You make a good point, but in the end it's not up to you.
Perhaps you want to offer your customers pseudonymity, perhaps your customers cannot use online payments due to compliance, geography or political reasons.
Perhaps you offer it for the free publicity (big one back in 2013). Who are we to judge? :)
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:21:48
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:19:26
More locked up in LN should increase price because of scarcity and because of increased utility. All while liquidity increases which will assure investors they are going to be able to trade bitcoin for other currencies and goods, establishing even more trust.
Is how I think about it.
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:37:19
Settlement transactions are stored on the blockchain, not every LN transaction.
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:07:53
Yes, I just hope the network participants are incentivised to make the LN network healthy enough.
I'm currently testing the Thor service from Bitrefill, then I caught a high-fee wave, so I'm waiting for the swap to clear onchain. Should be during the day if my intuition is right.
I'm also opening outbound channels from my own wallet.

True! Despite all the printing there is seemingly infinite demand for dollar.
Printing has more to do with adjusting overheating or cool economy, although I don't know if the fed is 100% coherent regarding that.
Keeping that in mind makes these things easier to understand.

Ofc not! Running a node or accepting bitcoin is not illegal.
Well, you do have to make that conversion some point in time, because businesses do their taxes in their national currency. Or possibly Euro.
Perhaps they don't need to make it at every purchase, but then again, why not?
