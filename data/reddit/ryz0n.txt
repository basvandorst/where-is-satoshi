Actually, how about not making posts like this because they are useless and for that matter not look at the price at all. I want to read good news because that good news is ultimately what is going to lead to the snowball of upswinging value. Unless you're trying to daytrade or something...

So if all the banks gather together in a monopoly to create their own blockchain, and the majority of the world is ignorant and believes that they have no choice but to use banks, does this spell doom for Bitcoin? I have a hard time believing that these ultra-powerful banks will be ushered out so easily and relinquish control.
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:38:32
Yeah u are right.  I read this later in the thread and it clarified it. Miners are incentivized by the currency and that's what keeps the ecosystem decentralized and alive. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 08:13:46
I feel like this only really affects the western world. Bitcoin is more than just making it easier to buy things. Nothing about the economy of financial makeup of the world is changed by apple pay. Yes, it might slow Bitcoin adoption in america, but there's a lot of places and situations in the world right now that have bigger problems than not wanting to take their wallet out of their pocket. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 18:20:16
But I didn't say that. I do care that people use it. I believe in technology and progress and seeing higher level concepts replace our flawed simple human logic of the past. I fully believe in the concept of Bitcoin. I love sci fi and futurism, so it's something I'm incredibly excited for. But why can't I also be excited about making some gains for having the foresight to believe in it this early? It's just not as black and white as ure making it.

Just curious, and I know it's been answered before,
but can the 2013 bubble be pinpointed to anything in particular? I know that it was like $100-$200 in January 2013? Then the Silk Road news came out and Bitcoin really entered the public domain and it shot up to $1200. Was there anything in particular in 2013 that attributed to this rise, other than the silk road news?
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:57:49

Steve is great and this is such an easy joke, cmon guys. Watching  some of you try to decipher this is kind of ridiculous. 
They're just two things that mean nothing to someone that is digitally uninformed. Would your grandma know what pixels are? Mine definitely didn't. It just wasn't part of their world. The joke is that both of them are just jargon words to people that aren't tech savy. It's hilarious because of how absurd the ignorance is, Steve definitiley knows what he is doing. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 12:22:36
This actually would be a great idea for the press and would motivate people that aren't familiar with bitcoin the need to learn how to transfer coins from a paper wallet into fiat.  Would help saturate bitcoins presence in the mainstream 
@_date: 2014-10-03 12:22:32
I dunno he's definitely not an idiot though. He's well studied on the topic and I think makes the valid counter-argument points to Bitcoin. Anyone that praises Bitcoin is really praising the block chain. I kind of agree. If you can separate the block chain and use it with fiat, u basically create a worldwide cheap payment system. I really am hesitant to think the dollar is gonna get replaced by the coin like a lot of u do. Bitcoin is about making a previous system more efficient, not replacing it.

Thanks man, this was very helpful. The real estate I was looking at is in Downtown, Los Angeles where there is a high rate of boom and growth right now. I'd be looking to live in what I buy as well, possibly rent it out in the future if I move on. It's a fairly safe bet that prices will be rising for the foreseeable future in downtown as LA is currently going through a housing crisis with an influx of new residents needing to buy and not enough on the market for sale.
@_date: 2014-08-01 11:12:39
The reason it is what it is is because u are enquiring the answer as a contestant. You don't claim to answer something, but rather posit the question. It's up to the judges to decide you are right. If you didn't phrase it as a question then you'd just be stating an answer when you're really seeking the judges approval. It's trivial (heh no pun intended) but makes sense.

Does any of this last comment of yours even add anything to your argument? Don't you know it's a long way to go for Bitcoin? You're acting like its current numbers are its finishing numbers.  There was a time when more people saw some bullshit movie in the 90's than were using the Internet for anything meaningful as well, what does this add to your previous points?
@_date: 2015-05-12 05:21:39
With all this Nasdaq news, even a couple of people that I personally know that work in financial have finally come around to Bitcoin being on their radar. However, their sentiment is along the lines of "doomed currency, great technology". What's everyone's take on Bitcoin's value as a currency. Does this Nasdaq news change any of that?

@_date: 2017-08-15 03:12:53
I think some of the difficulty that is suppressing mania is that there is a lack of information: Many people see Bitcoin at $4400 and think "Oh, it's unobtainable to me, I can't afford to buy one."
People don't realize you can buy any fraction you want. This was always the case when I tried to sell friends on it in 2014. I would tell them, "Ok fine dude, don't believe in it, but throw $100 at it and forget about it." 
No one listened.
If you explained to the average person that they could put any amount in they wanted and it would grow, I think more people would jump on board. People get fixated on the whole 1 coin price and think buying in full is the only way to invest.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:57:34
 I agree. This subreddit is a shell of what it was maybe two years ago. Every post now is about the price or some 16 year old that just invested $50. I guess maybe Bitcointalk is the place to go

And good job comparing bitcoin to pets.com lol
There literally isn’t any argument here other than trying to compare the two as bubbles. Under what evidence can you liken bitcoin to pets.com? I think you’re making false assumptions tbh. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 11:33:20
Ok...but I'm challenging you to tell me why you believe in your estimations, other than it's just your opinion.
You bring up these defunct companies but don't explain any reason why they are connected or in the same category as bitcoin other than a belief that bitcoin.
You do also realize that your examples are all companies, with products/services/revenues. You're comparing apples to oranges.
The reason bitcoin is compared to the internet is because you have to compare it to other decentralized in nature technologies. Bitcoin belongs to nobody and even with 1500+ altcoins currently, nothing is comparable to bitcoin.

I swear man. The spirit of bitcoin is all about seeing the bigger picture and there are just so many dweebs in this subreddit that are not such foresightful people. 
It’s also important to note that she isn’t just shilling some ICO or self interest scam. Of course she has bitcoin and wants it to go up. All us hodlers do. The key point is that she is evangelizing the technology and socioeconomic importance of bitcoin, which is the hardest pill for the mainstream to swallow and wake up to. 
There’s a reason she’s 32 with companies valued at 500 million USD and there’s sheep on here with the pre-programmed “influencers are such shit” attitude. She’s smarter than half of this community for sure and actually took the time to understand what bitcoin is really about.
@_date: 2019-10-05 09:33:11
Lol YouTube was the first platform that influencers were birthed from...
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:45:10
You’re too concerned about the price. For that reason, I would say you shouldn’t be investing more. If you really understood what this is all about, you wouldn’t be asking this question. You would just keep buying. 
Do yourself a favor and legitimately study bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:47:17
Lol people were saying the exact same thing as you in 2014, just with different numbers. 
You’ll look back later and regret not buying more at 5k just as people regretted not buying more at $200
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:01:25
You’re not being clever
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:47:22
What is your opinion based on though? You said absolutely nothing other than you think it peaked. For what reasons do you see the price not increasing?
Anyway, people said once again, the same thing after every bubble. 
For you to believe the price will depreciate over time and never return to ATH basically means that u think right now is the maximum extent a revolutionary decentralized, permissionless, 100% immutable global currency will ever impact the world...
Which to be honest, is a hilariously naive view to have. 
Urge you to learn about the technology more. 
It’s not any different if u were looking at the internet in the 90’s and believing it would only ever amount to e-mail. Bet you never considered how many industries of wealth that one piece of technology would birth.

So surprised reading this article about beauty and makeup vlogger Michelle Phan. I knew who she was for years, didn’t know she disappeared from making videos and being an influencer, but she certainly was a trailblazer. 
Her new passion and excitement is, bitcoin and blockchain. For me this is a lot of positive confirmation that you have another visionary and entrepreneur, and on top of that, a female that isn’t from the tech industry that is passionately bullish about bitcoin ����

Why is this a shit post? 
This is a young woman who has nothing to do with tech or cryptography,
doesn't fit the blockchain demographic whatsoever (Mainly douchebags and ex-poker player speculators), her industry and audience has no overlap with Bitcoin, yet here this article is, throwing in 4 paragraphs dedicated to an obviously smart, trailblazing and forward-thinking woman's newfound passion in Bitcoin.
IMO it's a quite powerful endorsement because it shows us 1. Millenial thoughtleaders really do value decentralization and freedom, 2. If a figure like her can become a Bitcoin evangelist, then the retail space (Her audience being mainly women online, the largest retail community) is psychologically ready to adopt bitcoin, 3. Endorsements from people like her carry more influence (Literally, she's an influencer) than finance bros or VC guys like Tim Draper, which is a great bullish signal for the mainstream's acceptance and willingness to adopt bitcoin when the time inevitably comes.

Million bucks won’t be worth shit then. Having bitcoin is just anti-poor insurance. I don’t know if anyone at this stage that isn’t rich yet will be rich.  Either way, not being poor in a future where a lot of people u know are gonna get backhanded by the tides of change is worth the investment.

lol, "the bitcoin"
Will be blunt with you: Yes it's your opinion, but your opinion is misinformed, in fact, under informed. Really can't have a serious discussion with you until you take the time to learn much more about bitcoin.
Here's some advice. Get Saifdean Ammous' book "The Bitcoin Standard."

Posts like this is why we are in serious trouble. Not looking good for crypto right now. Has anyone realized how much money has exited the market in the last two weeks?
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:28:25
Not probably. Will happen. It'll be over hundred years before the last coin is mined

Transfer of wealth. Currently, the majority of wealth is concentrated to such a small pool of individuals. If Bitcoin created a shit ton of millionaires, I think this would just be good for capitalism. Anyway, Hodlers would still be Hodling so not like money would be flooding everywhere.

Replace 2. And 3. With "2. Do not panic sell. 3.  HODL"
Bitcoin is teaching multiple generations the value of saving. Sure we all try to save money and have retirement funds and blah blah blah. I've lived my whole life in an inflationary world where the odds are continuously stacked against us more and more every year. Even if you're wealthy now, you're still wealthy in an unhealthy system. 
It's time for the human race to level up. Besides my own wealth, I'm excited for the fucking productivity of the species that bitcoin is going to unlock. 
Fuck FIAT 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:35:15
There weren't Superbowl Pizza Hut commercials that mocked Bitcoin in 2013 though.
I think there is wayy more attention now. Most people considered it a joke in 2013. Now people still consider it a joke, they're just more confident in what they know (Nothing)

This isn't a weak hands issue. This is an unhealthy market taking a turn for the worst now.
Bitcoin's tech is still fundamentally sound and I love it, but this market is dogshit and it's looking pretty bleak I would say for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:53:51
Yes, many people feel as if they have to buy a whole coin. I had friends last year complaining about this. Even when it was $400 or so, I had friends complaining that they would rather buy when it's $100 lol...
I dared my group of friends to throw $20 at it when it was $200 and forget about it, just to prove to them a point how little work it involves to make money. Their $20 at the last ATH would have been $500 only 2 years later lol...
You can only nag people so much I guess...

Lol such a joke that such mistakes could make it to publication from an established company like this. Where the hell was the editor. This just further reaffirms how many people still just seriously "don't get it" when it comes to Bitcoin. 
Personally I don't know how it's possible. I got it within two weeks of learning its existence in 2013.

The point is I don’t think anyone went through the time to make a paper wallet and laminate the amount permanently if it was only .5 a btc then. Just thought it was funny. I mean OP has a wallet with 1btc might as well have 1 LTC as well.

Yeah this was cool...when I read it in 2013...
Is there any purpose of this being on the subreddit anyway? Let’s talk about bitcoin instead, forget about the price and shit you can buy with said price 
@_date: 2019-09-13 19:58:02
Can you prove it’s really made in Switzerland? $400 seems pretty high for a quartz watch and doesn’t even have sapphire glass. After brands like MVMT that sell $10 Chinese watches for $150, it’s hard to trust anything that’s online
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:53:15
The reason I feel it’s different is because there was no attention on bitcoin before. There also wasn’t this crazy alt community stealing the marketcap. I want to see btc succeed because it has the fundamentals, fundamentals we’ve yet to see actualized on other competitors, but it seems it may fall behind some of the others in terms of price and growth

The problem is either a candidate is fiscally and governmentally progressive or they are socially progressive. I'm sick of the Dems cuz they're just some punk bitches that can't get shit done. I'm sick of the whole system actually. Replace all these bureaucrats with a protocol I say.

I know you blurred your addresses, but typically people create cold storage for the ultimate safety. Seems paradoxical to be taking pictures of them and sticking them in the internet. Just my 2 cents. Be careful in general. The more information you put online the more at risk you’ll be. Don’t underestimate people in this space. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:49:27
oh, ok then.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:53:24
Agree. When I first got in this was the ignoring phase. Then a lot of laughing and not taking it seriously. Now you constantly have to defend it and try to prove its value to people. On another level, you have to now defend bitcoin against the slew of shitcoins out there as well. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:52:18
I agree. 1 Million seems quite unrealistic. 6 figures a coin is easily obtainable I would say though.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:29:56
sell that BTC and get yourself an education to fix your spelling errors.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:04:22
You're not considering the market caps Bitcoin needs to eclipse from the 100,000 to 1,000,000 jump. It's not the same as 2,000 to 100,000
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:34:03
me too bruh, me too. No matter what advice people give me, I'm too afraid to do it on my own. I'm also just lazy though.
My fear about paper wallets is that what if I put the coins into this address, sure I keep the keys and never lose them, but what if at some point in the future some unforseen change or update happens and I can't retrieve the coins now. It's stress I wouldn't want to deal with.
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:50:40
Right. Well, putting it in a fiat context is just a way for people to determine value. It's just a figure that makes it easy to wrap your head around. But I agree, the ultimate goal I think for many here, is that one day in the future when Bitcoin's usage is totally assimilated into society and you can purchase anything with crypto, we won't need to be concerned with exchanging it back to paper $.

Am I being overly cynical for thinking this might be the eventual outcome of this cryptocurrency ride? I really don't have much faith in people. The oppressed gon' stay oppressed.

I tried buying .5 of Ether last night, coinbase kept saying my purchase was successful but nothing would show up in my ETH wallet...so I kept trying to purchase. Woke up today and I ended up having 4 Ether when I wanted just .5...and the $2.99 fee a bunch of damn times...
It's a shame the system had to fail me like this... :( 
First time experiencing issues with Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:22:04
I don't really get your point. Someone had to learn once what a bank was, what an atm was, how to widthdraw money, how to use a credit card. There's nothing inherently easy about fiat other than its been around and we've all been taught how it works. Bitcoin is new. It's going to take time before people learn these new things. Don't underestimate. Look how fast it took for the world to adopt Web 2.0 services. Once Bitcoin presents usefulness, it isn't going to be difficult to understand.

I'd like to know this as well but for a graphic designer. That being said, if anyone have any potential projects, let me know. At some point I want to contribute to the community other than just being a supporter.

Maybe too confusing currently. Why must the future be static? Bitcoin is ever-evolving and will make sense to the masses one day. My parents didn't understand the usefulness of smart phones until 2011. Could you explain to someone in the 1940's how to use Twitter? Or even how we're having a discussion right now? Don't be so shortsighted and naive.

Yeah this guy is not really saying much, thankfully he indicated he was drunk. The first half of his post is just basic shortsightedness of any non-innovative or pragmatic thinker. This whole idea that what exists now is set in stone. Not everyone's gonna control their bitcoins in the future. It's gonna mirror banks, let's be real, all hugely powerful things need infrastructure and regulation, but of course the new world order is gonna be built on the rules and limits of Bitcoin which is a much more pleasant banking environment than what we currently have. Anyway, to the moon bro.
