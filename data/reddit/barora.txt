they could at least reply back ...but they are not responding at all. What do you think we can do if the situation doesn't change for next few days or weeks. Is there any recourse at all?

Any luck?
Nothing has moved on my side. Just got a couple of emails last time around when I posted here ..and then no action. No clue what is going on.

This was my first deposit and my funds (CAD) are on hold for more than week now. I have tried to contact (371184) Kraken several times but there is no response. Has anyone lost there money permanently to Kraken?

I have not had good experience with Kraken at all. My first deposit of 2000 CAD and it is on hold for almost 10 days now and no response from the team ... raised tickets but no use. I wired my funds through TD and it took 2 weeks to show up in my account but "on hold" and no movement since then from Kraken. I would suggest to stay away from kraken. I hope they are legit ... but they could have at least responded to my several messages and tickets.

For how long have you been in this situation of held up funds... was that your first time as well?

Is Kraken even around? My funds are on hold since 5th June. Have raised three tickets so far. For those who got it resolved... can you please tell ...how long it took for you to get the funds. 
If depositing is so much hassle then how bad would be withdrawing the money from their claws?
