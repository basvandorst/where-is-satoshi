Segwit -&gt;legacy **IS** a SW trx.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:01:05
I would bet that we will not see a significant increase of SW usage (more than 2-3 % max) in the next couple of weeks. A lot of services switched to segwit lately, but the SW volumes stays at 10%. Seems like some actors want to keep segwit at this level. 
Let's also not forget that segwit was rising up to 20% after it was enabled and then dropped fast to ~10% (exactly when segwit2x was dismissed).  Makes you wonder how easy is to manipulate these values for political reasons.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:13:29
Exodus is a "beginner wallet" . Using this excuse they didn't even implemented SegWit addresses yet, acting against bitcoin well-being. Since SegWit is a prerequisite for LN, I guess it will be long until we see LN used in exodus.

1. Does such side chains exist today? 
2. Let's say that they will exist in the future, what does merged mining means? How is the bitcoin miner incentivised in a coin from a sidechain? Does he get that coin for mining bitcoin?

You go to settings and select Bitcoin -segwit blockchain. You click receive button and copy the address (it will start with 3). Then you click again on settings and chose legacy chain. You click send and paste the previous address (you can send all your coins or only part of it)
Once the transaction is confirmed you will have your coins in the segwit address. Note that for this you need to have the latest bitcoin app on your ledger.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:59:31
Well it is ok to sit on legacy at any point, not only if you are holding. However, have in mind that if at a later stage you want to move your coins, sending a transaction from legacy will (probably) be more expensive than from a segwit address, hence some people take this opportunity (mempool is low) to put their coins in segwit addresses.

I wonder why nobody talk about the "elephant in the room" about these delayed transactions. Maybe most bitcoin beginners will understand the concept of higher fees, faster confirmations.
But, I wonder how many understand/know about the concept of change and the fact that you could get a few bitcoins blocked for days (or weeks), because you send a 0.001 BTC trx with a low fee (as you don't really care when it will confirm).
@_date: 2017-02-19 13:18:25
virwox, check their .info website about how to do this via SLL
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:32:04
It's important for people to understand that the trx size (hence trx fees) is not necessary directly proportional with the number of btc sent (only with the number of outputs). So you might be forced to pay 0.0001 btc fee per trx even if you transfer 0.1 btc or 10 btc. This will favor (in the long run) big transactions (settlement and large money movement) vs. Buy a cofee trxs.

Thank you. So if you have an account on Fidor the fiat stays in your bank account and only leave your account when you execute an order? (No need to do a deposit/transfer before buying).

Is there any exchange that actually allows to deposit BCH? Right now only people that had BTC in exchanges that credited BCH are transacting. Anyway, taking in consideration the speed of block generation on BCH chain, I guess it would be useless for any exchange to open on-chain deposits now.

There is no stringent need for scaling right now, because bitcoin is not meant to be a replacement for visa or mastercard. 
If you hope for this, there are other technologies out there that are much better (see ripple for example).
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:43:15
Let's see how long it will take to discover the remaining blocks on BTC. Still 200 to go and discovery rate is around 3/h. BCH will soon have their retargeting (upward) also
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:09:28
They are actually much slower than 10 minutes over the last half a day
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:04:06
Except that the last few days showed us that (even with a single bitcoin chain), there isn't really a stringent need for scaling if there are no politically motivated spam attacks.

1. Of course it will go though, the support behind 2x is huge from all the miners
2. It is not the same story as btc/bch as this time the fork will not have replay protection so there will be no easy way to follow one chain or the other (it's more a fight till death between the two temporary chains)

@_date: 2017-08-21 07:43:42
It would be hard to transact in Bitcoin if for ~100 days you get only 20-25 blocks/day due to most of the miners switching to a segwit2x chain. 
People compare this with BCH, but we should remember that no-one actually believed the BCH would even exist 2-3 days before the split.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:14:17
3400 LOL. It can easily go down to 1700 or less.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:33:18
Fees are higher with the size of the trx not necessarily the amount. Or are you saying that miners are now picking only small amount transactions no matter the size of the fee?
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:36:11
Exactly this. There are other technologies out there that scale much better than bitcoin. Replacing visa or mastercard is not bitcoin scope.
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:24:15
My point was different. OP stated that he is happy that he will see both scaling method at work. But reality is that in the next weeks/months there will be no flood of transactions on any chain to allow us to make the comparison between the two solutions. And by the time there will be real transaction volume (not spam) that truly require more capacity probably BTH will anyway be history. 
P.s. even during high load I was able to do my transactions just fine (by fine I mean as I expect to do them on btc). Of course if you expect to use bitcoin for daily coffee cup you might be disappointed by fees or speed. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:42:59
I am in strong favor of segwit because of the other fixes that it brings. Also, I am happy about LN as it will improve the overall feature set of bitcoin. 
I don't think that number of trx/second is/was the most high prio thing to do.
I also think that previous consensus rules (95% approval) is correct and was enough of a mechanism to have segwit enabled at some point in time (3-5 years from now when no of trx would have become a true issue). I don't like all the politics and compromises around segwit2x.
I think this impatience of letting the market decide what it needs was due to a strong FOMO feeling in bitcoin community seeing other cryptos grow while we seemed stuck.  
However this was a fake feeling as what makes bitcoin unique (lack of central entity to rule/guide the community) comes with such downsides (we really need consensus from everyone from the ecosystem, including the guys that we don't like in order to make big changes). 
I think such solutions as segwit2x (reached behind closed doors) will open very dangerous doors for future changes. And anyway segwit2x didn't really solved anything (see bch fork from today as well as the entire circus that will be in 6 months from now with the 2mb change). So, bottom line, I'm not as happy as OP to see more technologies put to test. Ii could have already checked this looking at all other thousand coins around (some with technology vastly more complex and interesting than btc)
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:12:27
See hereL  and here:  the tables at the end of the page. Normally you should have 1 block every 10 minutes (on each chain) or ~6 blocks per hour. If there are fewer blocks found it means the hash rate is going down and viceversa. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:53:09
As a user you would have a non-usable token, whose value will go down very very fast. In this situation  a large chunk of bitcoin users will migrate to the chain that actually works (has blocks). Second, you are aware that ATM segwit2x does not offer replay protection, so you would not be able to simply choose where to "transact". At most you would be able to choose to **not** transact so to keep your coins safe (in case you are fanatic of one of the sides).

I'm also currious about ways to make some revenue while holding bitcoins. I was lending on bitfinex for a while, but luckily I stopped before they were hacked. I was also reading about a software that would allow you to run your own mixing service (or smth similar) and make some dividends. The advantage was that you would not send your btc to a 3rd party.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:08:06
At current rate more like 3-4 days. But I guess some miners will come back already to btc.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:16:14
You understand that the complain is against miners who deliberately make empty blocks. So there is no reason why a 2mb increase would help 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:33:10
* BCH removed the SegWit code, so I think point 1 is invalid.
* 3,4 and 5 are almost the same (and we don't know if segwit2x will not implement replay protection in the end)
* 2 is very subjective. You have 8MB vs 2MB with segwit vs 1MB with segwit. What is the optimal increase in capacity depends on who you ask.
* 4 - new downward difficulty adjustment, is a subject that is often to easily skipped. We have no idea how it will impact on the long run, and it is trivial to attack it (e.g. have some miners to mine a few blocks every 12h so the new mechanism does not trigger)

Any address starting with a '1' cannot be a SegWit address, but some addresses starting with a '3' aren't SegWit addresses, and some SegWit addresses don't start with a '3'. Not sure how this website count, but I guess it is counting as SW all addresses starting with "3".
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:53:15
We are far from this to happen. What makes bitcoin unique is that it was the first coin there and that it is not controlled by anyone (at least as long as satoshi doesn't raise from the dead). As a store of value it will be incredibly hard for some other coin to take this from btc. Yes, there will be better coins out there for buying a cup of coffee or for running some smart contracts in a distributed fashion, but that will not raise their price as much.
What we need to be worry about is bitcoin destroying itself from inside with things like bch, 2X etc

A lot of people invested, but I think you are interested in the ones that didn't sell until now. 
And here is the trick. The math is simple, if you bought 100 btc at 1 dollar and now 1 BTC = 2500 then now you have 250.000$. But, think about it, if you bought at 1 dollar would you have sold when your investment doubled (2 dollars)? multiplied by 10 (10 $/BTC)? multiplied by 1200 and then dropped for 2 years at ~ 300?
Reality is that very very few people would actually have kept all the money until now (and if they did, they will probably not sell it now either). More likely there are people that bought bitcoins and forgot about them (and can still get the private key).
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:52:54
But how is this really a benefit when shopping online (beside personal preference)? Unless you earn bitcoins from somewhere(e.g. job, mining, etc)  you probably bought them either by giving some exchange a tap into your account or by spending some time&amp;energy to buy them in some shady face2face deal. Why to spend them afterwards to buy some food/electronics/clothes/ books/other common items online (and also risk to have a under optimal user experience as OP described)

Right now Satoshi is not voluntary hiding from any government entity. He is most likely dead and we will never hear from him again. 
In the beginning it was his  personal choice to not reveal his identity, but I doubt that this choice had the huge impact on bitcoin that you suggest it had.
