Not really hard to believe in light of the fact that english isn't his native language. So depending on who the target audience is he writes more/less carefully. Eg the email to the council seems like a pretty meh email with little to no thought going into it. In contrast the second link is a technical advertisement for a scientific venture he has invested xxx years of his life into - so he wants it to sound decent and rereads/polishes what he wrote.

Enterprise java imo. Pick whichever uber framework you want (im a spring fanboi), wire things together, then hook up your database with hibernate, junit test for a while. Then go live. Easy peasy.

Good to see bitcoin also suffers from a deficiency in documentation like every other software project does.
