What the hell does any of that mean? wha? huh? dude.
@_date: 2016-04-03 23:38:30
I never said that I was for it. I am just pointing out the writing on the wall. Goodluck.
@_date: 2016-04-11 04:02:30
Don't mine via theft. Let the commie bastards in China do it.

Bitcoin is such a cluster fuck, i'm amazed it's 1000 dollars. It's fascinating really.
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:40:51
If one man can bring the price down 15 percent with words, then my optimism is quickly vanishing.  
@_date: 2017-02-13 18:13:34
China, showing it's true face.
@_date: 2016-01-17 07:12:47
Worry about your own panties, girls.
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:52:17
Bitcoin has become owned and controlled by the Communist State of China. Decentralized is excellent, if it is done in the West, but this experiment is almost finished. Wake up! 
  
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:12:24
This is like eth/etc 2.0. Make sure your shit is off an exchange, so you can enjoy spoils from both chains folks!
@_date: 2017-02-13 18:09:35
All depends on ETF.
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:50:36
And for the better.

@_date: 2016-01-16 13:33:38
If only bitcoin could shrug off the Chinese miners.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:40:21
The power to act is with the miners. So the focus should be on the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:30:30
Koinbase sucks.

I have respect for a person who actually has principle, a person who stands up and speaks his mind, against what would be easier for him to do.

@_date: 2016-01-30 14:40:24
7 tps, no way, bitcoin is a forerunner though. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:36:38
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:50:04
The power to do nothing is with the majority, which is the Chinese miners. That is the crux. East versus West. Cut the Chinese out, and watch how fast change comes. It would come faster than you know. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:19:11
I don't see where I come off as "euphoric" about any craziness in price volatility. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:03:52
I just hope he keeps talking the price down, so I can buy more.

I rarely spend my digital gold, except for the occasional bet, or sometimes I give bitcoin to others, but that's just me. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:10:38
Go slow, explain in detail. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:34:36
Thanks! I will give it away!
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:20:19
I had a thought, not sure if it is possible, but, imagine you could buy a coin or token, and in that coin or token are 5 of the top cryptos. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 10:52:26
Good info, thanks!
@_date: 2015-08-25 04:22:45
It's a wild guess. Bitcoin down more than fiat markets. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:36:35
When bitcorn etf comes, yes.
@_date: 2015-08-23 09:19:00
You don't know me. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:43:54
lol! 
@_date: 2015-08-26 05:17:26
This is horrid! What a soap opera. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 03:14:57
I hold. Why spend digital gold? 
@_date: 2015-08-23 22:43:20
Again, I don't know you. Maybe you need to take a deep breathe and relax? I love bitcoin, I have my opinions, but I'm not here to get into emotionally charged conversations. I don't consider myself a " slime bag " and I certainly wouldn't call another such things, regardless of their views. Use whatever works, I view my bitcoin as some view gold. It's not so easy to exchange fiat for bitcoin for me, so, when I do, I hold.  
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:35:08
People are not decentralized. That is the problem.

You are a bit late bruh.
@_date: 2016-09-09 03:49:52
Good, I see you have some manners. Well enough.
@_date: 2016-09-09 03:10:07
Adding to what? There is no mining community. No, there is, Commie Chinese. Why is he not looking into Dash or something more reasonable? Seems out of touch.
@_date: 2016-09-09 03:18:31
You know what, you are right. Welcome John, welcome to this " community" . 
@_date: 2016-09-10 14:20:54

Back then, you had to put in some work to get laid. You had to write shit down, talk face to face, walk to the dam mall. These hipsters have it made.
@_date: 2015-09-25 03:10:16
People will actually pay you fiat for your bitcoin you know?

Can't translate. What does it mean?

I really want to try the gas trick, when I spend my coin, I cannot replace it fast enough tho.

It is too close, needs to step back.

Is the test still on? I thought it was starting tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:12:06
Just learn, how not to lose your coin and you will be fine.
@_date: 2015-09-19 02:44:48
Why stop there? Scrap banks!

I just sold half of mine. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 02:18:42
The thing is, I thought about it, I considered it, but then, I pictured the tribal tattoo, and guns, and wierd shit, and islands, and I just laughed out loud.  
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:21:10
@_date: 2015-09-09 13:54:21
@_date: 2015-09-07 10:14:31
Hurry up and fail banks, bitcoin, hurry up and scale.
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:28:30
Whatever works first.
@_date: 2015-09-25 11:44:08
How do these companies get so much startup money? Ludicrous.

@_date: 2015-09-09 13:06:25
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:18:39
It's gambling. Gambling already makes up half the transactions.
@_date: 2015-09-01 10:18:05
I asked my banker friend what he thought of bitcoin about a year ago, he laughed at it. I bet he isn't laughing anymore.
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:45:13
How so? 
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:01:32
Of course they use bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:40:24
.0001 is very cheap. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:52:10
@_date: 2015-09-30 18:11:16
Should I sell my coin in 2024 then?
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:40:54
I agree, importing/sweeping should be much clearer.
@_date: 2015-09-01 10:21:29
What area?
@_date: 2015-09-03 19:22:41
Can you share any more info ? 
@_date: 2015-09-25 03:05:18
I'm sure I will be down-voted but I think circle and coinbase are 6 months from being obsolete. I appreciate the little things. Circle promised a 5 dollar credit, not long ago, and they did not honor their offering. Normally, I don't care about such small rewards, but, they did not honor it. I have steered 100 people away from circle and I will continue to do so. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 18:11:22
Anyone know where the deposit address qr is located on shapeshift's homepage?Maybe I am blind, but I just can't find it.
@_date: 2015-09-10 20:59:03
I just added it, really neat, super impressed with Coinami and ShapeShift!
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:20:25
Interesting, I'm curious myself.
@_date: 2015-09-19 21:45:16
Don't be too hard on yourself Dear.
@_date: 2015-09-15 10:24:39
Yes, you get my point, I didn't mean " value transfer protocol" is better, but said that to make my point. It's funny, yesterday I was doing business with a certain person, and I know that bitcoin would be very advantageous to him and I know it will affect his business in the future, so I asked him what he thought of bitcoin and he completely disregarded bitcoin, which made me think of the many people who will completely miss the boat on this fun ride. Not to get off point, I think streamlining and simplifying some features, especially specific wording might help simplify, but I also am beginning to think that maybe it's all too complicated for a person that has no interest in learning or using bitcoin.     
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:42:21
I'm not sure, but I plan to buy a little soon, so I will let ya know. Philadelphia area here.

What is a good multi-crypto wallet for android? Holy transaction? 
@_date: 2015-09-26 09:19:48
Same old story. F block size, we need anonymous transactions. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:09:18
She will use whatever works. Hopefully it will be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-21 12:53:44
When is the bitcorn launching???
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:26:36
Atleast they announced it.
@_date: 2015-09-21 13:03:43
@_date: 2015-09-03 17:16:15
I'm in Philly area and I wish we had something going on around here like that.

I will buy at 210, maybe tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-09-14 23:38:24
I wondered the same.
@_date: 2015-09-22 10:16:02
Seems like never, sigh.
@_date: 2015-09-15 10:06:22
Yes, I think it would be beneficial for adoption, making the wallets much more simple. I use Mycelium and I really like that wallet, but when I'm moving my coin from cold storage into my wallet there are like 4 things that an average person shouldn't see. I think terminology changes would help, but I think it's too late to change any of that, even bitcoin itself is a horrible name, it should be like "value transfer protocol" or something, but hey, that's by the wayside now. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 21:48:24
Come on Bill... Take your vaccines and shove them up your ass.

I agree with your plan.
@_date: 2015-10-04 16:10:05
Yeah, I put it on Gus, but I should have dropped it on Bader. I thought Bader looked great, except his position, always backed into the cage.
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:45:07
RIP Ethereum.
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:30:46

@_date: 2015-10-04 16:40:46
I hope not, but I have been reading a ton of posts about transactions not broadcasting and other stuff, I also had a problem with a transaction, but it was just fine in the end. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 17:39:57
