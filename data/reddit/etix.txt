*Disclaimer: VideoLAN treasurer here*
It took us a long time to decide whether or not we were going to accept bitcoins but we finally did it and we're really happy with the move. And while I'm here, a big thank you to for the warm welcome!

Never thought we could get so much in less than a day to be honest… It even exceeded the amount we got from Paypal donations!

We did a vote during a VideoLAN developers meeting in Berlin few months back and the majority won. As simple as that :)

Fine, we'll do.

First legality, we would like to avoid troubles as much as possible with the authorities. Then security, we had to setup few rules (mostly around cryptography and backup) to protect the content of the wallet. And finally the currency conversion but we're still wondering how we're going to spend this money.

Thanks for the kind words. About the donation tab, it will be reworked as soon as I find some time to work on it. Of course it will contain a bitcoin button / QR code.

Excellent idea! I didn't know that the bitcoin scheme was part of the HTML5 standard. Anyway link added to the page, thanks sir.

We did not expect that much already.
