That are mostly transactions with low fees. So the sender does not care if the confirmation takes A bit longer. If you pay 50 satoshi,  transaction is in the next block.

And how do you handle the fact that crypto has private and non reversibel transactions ?

In that case they have no value anymore

I find this hard to understand, don't you have a problem with the fact that bitcoin is a souvereign currency ?

I really find it hard to store my seed in a safe way.
1. Has to be accessible from everywhere
2. Needs to have a log.
3. Needs to have a sharing option in case of death 
Whats my solution ?
@_date: 2017-02-16 17:37:27
I think that would be a big advantage. If for example a war breaks out between Belgium and holland. I can't go back but I still wan't to acces my seed. If it's in a vault that would be a serious drawback. I like the idea I can travel the world and knowing I can acces my bitcoins everywhere I want. Also, I'm not ok with storing this in dropbox.

You can put the hash in the transaction.

the point of encryption is that you don't have to hide it.
Also there is no power on the outlet, so it has no use ...

where did you get that number, did you calculated it yourself ?

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:59:01
You claim that is easier to censor something with a theoretical 51% attack, than ETH, witch has been censored, after the DOA. That's jus not a fair argument to make. Also, BTC and ETH are 2 different things, they both are currencies, but only BTC can be considered money. You pay a transaction fee for storing your transaction in the most secure ledger in the world, if it's to expensive use something else but don't tread it like a bug, it's a feature.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:07:12
Ok, think I understand. So in this current system a very small % of BTC will be lost do the fact of rounding down numbers if the reward reaches 0.000000005. Rewards will not be backwards creditit if we increase the numbers of decimals. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:14:51

No option for that in iOS version. Dont trust Android phones to store btc :-)

Not trying to make things more complicated here, sorry about that, i'm just pointing out that great claims need extraordinary evidence. You stated that humans have a destructive behavior, yet we are still here and improving all the time, mostly thru individual actors. If more 51% of people where bad, it was game over a long time ago. Off-course BP is a private company, but it isn't working in a free market. Its so big because of the intervention of the state. A free market does not allow such big companies, It’s to hard to maintain. History shows us this, it’s well documented. Your claim that Libertarianism is not “the real world” even to it’s the closest thing to natural law I can imagine off seems a bit off. Collectivism like in the US and Europe seems to me less like the “real world” and a opt-in master/slave relation enforced by violence. Not saying that Collectivism is always bad, people can freely choose this as a temporary state, and like how Chomsky says it so beautiful, “Anarchy assumes that the burden of proof for anyone in a position of power and authority lies on them.  Their authority is not self-justifying.  They have to give a reason for it, a justification.  “ and for this it’s great  that Roger and Jihan are trying to challenge this, bitcoin is a form of collectivism, its get challenged, driven by greed, by cronny capitalism, to justify it’s current state. So instead of you are proving your argument I’m here trying to defend my question. I believe that people are good and moral creatures, and even when the individual responsibility gets taking away, and gets replaced by religion, states or institutions, we still tend to do more good than bad.

@_date: 2017-11-10 02:03:25
Thx, but that wasn’t the question. My question was about the block reward. What would happen when we change the decimals to more than 8 after miners already recieve 0,0000000. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:03:30
-Fiat isn't money, it's currency
-On top of that, BTC can be censored by unilateral action from a single actor, who is even known to be greedy. That is the problem.
Whuuuut ?
-You say that like it would be a good thing. You're telling the world that they can fuck off, because Bitcoin doesnt have the capacity for them.
Bitcoin has all the potential to scale, just not for the moment. Like I said, If 50 cents is to much for a transaction you can easly use LTC, ETH, Doge, etc, etc, ...  It's not because some coin has the cheapest transaction cost that makes it a better product, it's utility that makes the price (and offcourse speculation atm :-) )
@_date: 2019-06-08 10:51:37
think you are missing the point, If you make a security setup and need to deviate from normal behavior it's not a secure setup.
@_date: 2019-12-22 18:54:34
Its also not good for the environment
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:30:39
Any proof of this destructive behavior of humans when there are no institutions or government in place? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:37:41
What happens when we allow more decimals than 8 ? 
@_date: 2019-04-28 13:34:58
exchanges aren't bitcoin. Also you can pay whatever fee you want, last week I did a BCH transaction for 0,0000001 BCH and payed a 1,8 BCH fee, talk about expensive.
@_date: 2017-04-26 23:01:52
Fiat has an average lifespan of 27 year. Don't forget that fiat hasn't got real value, bitcoin and other crypto's have. don't mix up Money and currency, 2 different things. Bank run insured ? with what ? the dollars that in case of a bank run are worthless.
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:33:17
Hi, sorry for my late respons. 
First, It is not always bad that the fiat goes in default, like the dollar in 1971, If there is enough trust it will make a nice restart. The problem is there when the trust is gone. Saying the trust in US government is always gonna be the same seems for me a bit easy. Some president can fuck up all the assets the US holds for repaying the debt, than the trust is gonna and the dollar goes in default.
Second, the reason I stated that Fiat doesn't have a value is because it doesn't hold value on its own. But that is incorrect because you can burn them for heat, that the real value. Bitcoin on the other hand ( and other crypto's) hold a value because they have properties that are value, like gold. Gold's value is mostly subjective but also has a industrial value. Bitcoins value is also part subjective but also has a industrial value. You can store things in a network, you can verify thing in that network, you can store information in that network. That's why I say that bitcoin has real value and Fiat not. FIAT is only money by LAW, that's also what fiat means in latin "Let it become"
The crisis of 2008 is in a lot off peoples opinion not over yet, also that's just an opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:31:00
How I agree with you that oil spills are not good, it isn't a response to my question unless you think the oilspil was deliberate. Also it's fair to say that such a big company, like BP, is the product of government interference. When there are no consequences on failure and you only receive a small fine when you fuck up we can't uphold greed as the cause of this problem, it's the master-slave relation that causes this problems, not free market economics.

Quick question:
So what I also did is this:
-Changed my iphone region to france / created a UK apple ID / installed the app "boon" to create a virtual Mastercard / Connected the "boon" mastercard to my apple ID / called home to asked for a Belgium mastercard to top off my "boon" Mastercard / give in the data of the card / send back the verification code / Bingo
PS: Does anybody knows a Bitcoin Visa/mastercard that can be added to apple pay ?

Bitcoin forks all the time. Its only so that it does not create a split if no one keeps mining the fork. Miners normally always go back the last block On the longest chain.

I would think that if a certain protocol is activated that can serve as a trigger, If certain criteria are met a software update is distributed to the community. I don't know either but maybe my point is that my post is also a statement that DAO's aren't there yet :-) And thus the price not really correct is, I mean, if even the people who are making this shit up aren't using it to enforce contracts, why does it have any value at all ?
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:46:26
1. it's not because there are only 21 mil. Bitcoins that there aren't enough bitcoins. you can easely devide bitcoin. For the moment up to 8 figures.
2. Transactions in btc are instant, only the confirmation take up to 10-20 minutes. some people want 1 confirmation, some more than 5. In the future confirmation will also be instant with new upgrades of bitcoin.
3. if you call bitcoin complicated that's personal, I think its easy as fuck
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:31:34
i'm well aware of the fact that there was no premise in your statement. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:05:59
Do you really think that ? Other coins with other utility seems to me not an absurd thing. Bitcoin isn't perfect for everything. Ofcourse Bitcoin can adopt other utilitys but sometimes is just beter in an other token. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:29:56
I don't understand this argument. We want a free market currency but if there's competition from an other token we say that's a bad thing ?
