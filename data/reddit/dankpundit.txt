I think we are seeing a bubble of new, self-appointed bitcoin experts.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:34:18
HODL like this guy.

In since 2011.  This runup feels very different than all others I've experienced.  First off the staying power.  It's been running up for almost a year now and accelerating.
We still have experts speaking of bubbles and tulips, but I think hitting 10K has given it some legitimacy from the masses and burst the bitcoin skepticism bubble.

I thought we were discussing the BCH fork.  Miners have done well since then as they switch from Bitcoin to BCH.  And the value of crypto has increased dramatically so the coins they mine are worth 10 times+ what they were a year ago.


Okay.  I see your point here.  There would be an impact on geographic centralization of mining but I'm not so sure it would be significant.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:59:28
What's your guess then?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:12:37
How high(approx) will the price get and how much of a correction?  Because if it goes to 25K and drops to 24K in two weeks, I wouldn't consider that a correction.  How far will we fall?
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:11:03
Feels like it to me but who really knows?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:54:25
This is a full court press attack by a central authority led by RVer.  The attacks use marketing, traditional media, social media, market manipulation and network spamming and are sophisticated and highly coordinated.  They may even seem scary.
Just hodl tight.  Bitcoin will win again and again.

This is just how bitcoin works from what I understand.  To create an output(your transaction), it will take a previous input(or combination of inputs) and send the amount you wish and return your change from that previous input.
All wallets will use more than one address for privacy reasons.  All of this is done in the background so that its more user friendly.
Have confidence in your Ledger.  Hardware wallets are the best when it comes to security and convenience. :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:25:40
No impact.  That's a minuscule adjustment.  The Bitcoin difficulty adjustment is designed to keep blocks coming about every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:59:29
Wallet addresses aren't necessarily anonymous.  It really depends on how you use bitcoins and the steps you take to remain anonymous.  You should read this to understand more:

The bitcoin skepticism bubble burst when the price crossed 10K.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:02:48
[This sums it up for me.](
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:16:36
Um... nah.

It's revolutionary.  It's simulating a physical property to a digital good.  Scarcity.  And doing so in a decentralized way.

Your ledger nano is using more than one bitcoin address.  The extra amount you see moving out on the blockchain is likely change getting sent back to a wallet your ledger controls.
Is the balance on your ledger nano correct?  If so, you have nothing to worry about.

Sounds sinister, but I do like the Core approach better than just raising the block size.
Currently miner incentives are misaligned.  It is more profitable for them to spam the network so that fees are raised for legit transactions and they make more money.  Whether this is happening or not, this incentive remains there even with the block size raised.  It has to be removed.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:13:38
The bubble burst when the price reached 10K.  The bitcoin skepticism bubble.
Been HODLing a while and I see much more genuine interest when bitcoin is brought up.  I've had a lot of friends hitting me up asking if I still have my bitcoins and celebrating when they hear the answer.  Others want crypto investment advice and help investing.  After six years of telling my brother about bitcoin, he FINALLY bought some bitcoin today.
I think bitcoin has a ways to go before we top out.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:20:01


SHA256 Miners are making more money than ever before even after the fork.


So then why grant them more power over Bitcoin by ceding to their demands of raising the block size?  I'm not altogether against it, but we need transaction alternatives like LN in place before we raise the block size.  This way, if miners choose to clog the network with spam and inefficient transactions, there is an alternative route to deliver your transaction.


It may?  How?
@_date: 2018-08-28 04:25:13
You misunderstand.  Hash rate isn't increased because of predefined code, it's increased by the miners joining the network.  The network responds by raising difficulty so as to insure that blocks continue to come at roughly every 10 minutes.  
If bitcoin didn't "take off", the hash rate would not be this high.  It's like that Yogi Berra quote, "Nobody goes there anymore. It’s too crowded."

Where is the part that Cuban screwed him out of his company? I was there starting 1996 and never saw Jaeb.  If he got 10% then he did quite well also.
Anyway, Jaeb's original vision doesn't sound anything like what Audionet did.
"The original idea, a shortwave radio that would receive broadcasts inside a sports venue, morphed into a hand-held device that would receive customized satellite broadcasts."
See?  No mention of broadcasting over the internet at all.  Cuban and Wagner were the real visionaries. That's not to say he's correct about Bitcoin.  In this instance he is dead wrong.
When I started we were working in a small warehouse that Cuban had owned, not Jaeb.  Cuban had previously renovated to live in and also have a built in basketball court.  
Employees made tons of money off stock options.

If miners don't leave en masse like they were before DAA, then obviously blocks get mined at a regular interval and transactions are processed...  so no.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:33:59
So if I'm understanding the mechanics, here's how it should work out.
While BTC is easier to mine and thus more profitable, the difficulty adjusts down after each and every block on the BCH chain so that in time it becomes more profitable and entices miners back.  But since these are slow adjustments on a 24 hour rolling average we would see a leaking of miner support and not them leaving en masse.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:28:51
Yep.  I've been downloading the blockchain since Friday night.  50% through and in June, 2016.
Blockchain doubled in size over the last 16 months?  Wow!
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:52:47
I'd stick it out.  Less than 20K transactions in front of you currently.  You  ay have it in the morning.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:30:00
You can see the progress since this weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:40:16
I'd say that if last weekend taught us anything its that miners have way too much power and most have no regard for the health of the coins they mine.
Scaling off-chain and away from miners is the right path.
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:11:17
Sorry bro.  This is all untrue.
Cuban and Todd Wagner were co-founders in Audionet which later was renamed to [broadcast.com](  Employees made gobs of money with stock options.
I was there.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:43:41
Looks like it was flagged as off topic.  There's your answer.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:28:57
A block was just found that processed 2371 transactions.
It's clearing up.  I've seen the mempool in far worse shape before.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:20:12
Not really when considering that at the height of last weekend's fork fight there were 180,000 unconfirmed transactions.  The network is catching up after being artificially slowed to a crawl.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:55:23
Very true.  That's exactly why they want bigger blocks.  So that they can fit more transactions in them and collect fees.
The flippening will not be happening.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:39:18
Easy.  HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:04:41
I will.  Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:06:52
I don't think so.
What was causing miner flight before was the massive swings in difficulty using EDA to adjust difficulty.  The new DAA adjusts after every block on a rolling 24 hour average to ensure that they are discovered roughly every ten minutes.  These are several minor adjustments so no more wild swings.
The only thing that could cause a mass exodus of miners now is if the price swings majorly in favor of BCH.
@_date: 2019-09-15 06:17:59
I agree with Nick Szabo when he characterizes Bitcoin as an engineered force of nature.
You suggest something very different in that we artificially adjust the network's monetary policy to whatever it is sufficient to pay miners.
Why not just continue to allow a fee market to naturally decide what is sufficient for miners?  One has already emerged on its own and will continue to mature along with the network.  This will provide sufficient incentive for miners to continue securing the network even when the block reward is negligible.
