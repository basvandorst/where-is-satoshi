@_date: 2017-12-24 23:36:09
just wanted to clarify that it's in the last and not early alpha. why the fuck should anyone care what i personally think about the timeline?^^

coincidentally the article starts with "the bitcoin debate is a totally overheated one. all sides just throw around their half-truths and predictions. it's time for an impartial assessment..."
and then they go on to debunk a bunch of myths.
