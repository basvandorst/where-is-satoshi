If you're using that kind of cash I'd had use that special pen to check if a note is fake or not, they're cheap. I wouldn't trust that kind of money to an unknown person.

I'm also a newbie so I don't have much idea, I'm experimenting with btcs right now and my first though is to hodl them.
I don't find them useful to buy things/services right now  because I have to pay a lot of fees to buy/sell/move them and I don't have to do that with my bank.
Also, bitcoin is not stable, if someone asks me to pay 0.05btcs for something, that quantity can be anything from 40 euros to 55 euros in just an hour. It varies much more in a month.
Then, if I pay with bitcoins I have to buy more and then I have to pay fees again, so I'm wasting money doing things I can do with regular money.
Even if I have to change currency, it's cheaper than buying bitcoins. If I buy bitcoins with my debit card I have to pay 3.5-4 euros, that's an absurd amount of money.
That's why I can only see bitcoin as an investment for the future.
I'm not interested in being anonymous, I just like the idea and I want to follow them hoping to convert them to euros in the future or maybe pay with them if I have enough of them and it's cheaper to use them than using regular coin.
Again, I'm a newbie and I'm reading all I can to understand them better but that's my view right now and it's probably others view of bitcoins.
