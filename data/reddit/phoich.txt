barrier to entry = depressed price. just think of it that way and be happy that you were one of the folks who was willing to jump through hoops to get your BTC. That's worth something.

Re the hoarding issue, I think it's a "growing pain" problem and not a sustainable issue:
It's one thing to hold on at $750, hoping that the price doubles. But for prices to be in the range of $10k-$100k, the market cap of Bitcoin has to approach $120B-$1.2T. It can't get there without heavily infiltrating multiple economies (black market $1.8T, online poker $X.XT(?), 180 countries w/ GDP&lt;$1.2T). So for it to approach those price levels at least the folks who frequent whichever economies that adopt it will have no choice but to transact with it. And the more it is accepted, the less hoarding will be possible.
No?

This would have been my first time verifying and I'm not seeing a "Call Me" option

re huge swings in price:
Isn't this a direct result of Bitcoin's relative youth? Hypothetically, if it was adopted worldwide and the volume increased 1,000,000x, wouldn't the volatility naturally decline? Moreover, isn't currency volatility uniquely a result of that currency's value relative to other currencies? So, theoretically, if Bitcoin were allowed to progress naturally and replace all currencies globally with a limited supply of 21,000,000 Bitcoins, wouldn't currency volatility be eliminated altogether?
