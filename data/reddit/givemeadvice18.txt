Care to explain how it was done? Kept running variations of the script in electrum without success. Wasn't sure if it writes a puzzle.txt file?

I think you're a bit misinformed. They will be giving 1 B2X for each BTC stored with them. You will still have all of your BTC, but the fork will effectively divide the price of BTC into some ratio split between the two. So if B2X rises, BTC will fall.

Thanks for a very thorough reply. I'm certainly not against holding, but I have fallen victim of the idea that I've "missed out" on the original buy-ins that would've allowed for me to purchase multiple bitcoin and see larger returns. As such, I think my mind trends toward the idea of trading under certain conditions. I'll need to ride it out a bit more and see where things go in the days leading up to the fork. Thanks

Buying on GDAX and was under the assumption it was 0.25%, so I guess fairly negligible. I think the risk isn't worth it for the dollar amounts I'd be trading at.

You do realize there are more exchanges than just one right? On CMC it has reached $10k

So I've been trying to short in this way, but can't get myself to pull the trigger, because even if I sell for example 0.3 BTC and the price drops say $100, I'm still only making $30 on it, and by the time I buy again I'll get hit with fees. Feels like the risk/benefit just isn't there. 
What are you paying in fees to rebuy?
