You seem to not understand what gold is. It has been money for thousands of years. It is used in jewelry, dentistry, electronics, computers, medicine, food, space industry, construction and art etc.  It is also an element. You cannot create anything like it. There is no real comparison.

As long as this is the case it does not matter.

This is pure mania mentality. We all believe bitcoin is going much higher but non us know the future. It is good to take money off the table from a risk management point of view especially when the price is high.

As long as you only put in a amount that you do not stress over you will be OK. Most financial people cap it at 10% of your net worth.

Currently bitcoin lacks one of the most important qualities of money and that is a stable store of value. It has no value outside of confidence in its price rising or being able to exchange it for something. It is a speculative asset. It is Instagram right now but might be Myspace in the future. There are hundreds of cryptos.  Gold is superior money and has stood the test of time.  Gold has multiple uses outside of being money. There is only one Gold. This is the view of majority of the economists of the Austrian school of economic thought.
