I treat them like I treat a start up. I don't invest in start ups right now.
They also can be seen as a hedge against mainstream fiat currencies. This would lump them together in the same group as gold and silver. I currently don't own anything of this style as well but I'm thinking about it.
In the former case, start ups should be no more than 5% of your portfolio and that is only if you invest in many start ups. In this respect bitcoin should be less than 1% of your portfolio.
In the latter case, hedging against mainstream fiat currencies should be no more than 10% (and I think closer to 5% is better) of your portfolio and again that is if you are diversified among those kinds of assets. So in this respect crypto currencies should be no more than 1%-5% of your portfolio.

Does the co-founder say "Bitcoin is my five-year investment plan" or does he say "I don't look at the daily movements because I intend to hold for 3-5 years"?

Just your investments, not counting your primary residence and a healthy chunk of cash that you hold as an emergency fund
The purpose of my post is to be contrarian to the mainstream view in this subreddit, just FYI

it doesn't matter what the price per bitcoin is, people would deal in fractions of a bitcoin if that is too rich for their blood
