Nope core is done.

There's a cliff up ahead and the bridge is out. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:37:50
I will buy next week at 1k cad
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:20:39
IKR? I never take my eyes off it. Its now part of my HUD.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:22:34
Its value is whatever it is currently but it is going to zero.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:55:38
Flippening bro. I can give you many reasons. Core is unusable.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:34:50
Just buy. I thought I was so smart buying and selling and increasing my btc. Then I sold around 7500cad on was it Saturday and well you can see I don't have any btc right now. If I hadn't ever sold and just held my original investment I'd have an extra 50 bucks if I hadn't sold Saturday I'd be up an extra 150. I was warned and didn't listen. Now I am sitting here waiting for a drop that may never come. Still up overall 358 so I'm not crying lol.

Send me your computer and let's get this solved.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:37:17
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:31:51
How much?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:50:16
Sounds like a majestic idea to have as you wander through a garden...
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:51:00
Going to 2k within a week.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:15:32
Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:08:42
Wait and see I guess.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:00:31
Just sold high myself will buy back low. I agree here it comes.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:25:05
Reverse psychology?
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:38:13
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:10:55
We (I) did.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:20:34
Looks like a 13. Spooky.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:02:47
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:58:07
I agree with your sentiment. My only worry with bitcoin is not its value but the Orwellian big brother you speak of, in a moment of sheer desperation(they are losing if you haven't noticed), shutting down the internet or the grid. If this happens though I guess being able to use bitcoin or not will be a bit of a mute point...
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:23:46
I prefer it go down.
Edit: then up again of course.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:23:12
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:54:25
A lot of cases I have seen the authorities force the dealer or the dealer willingly turns over the bitcoins in the interest of "cooperation"
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:53:23
Misery loves company...
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:33:21
My life savings of 1,000.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:37:04
Hodl for how long? Forever? Banking on using it as currency to buy everything rather than an investment you convert to fiat?
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:50:54
I bought back in before the last dip because the fork came two days early which I didn't expect.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:05:56
Not sure if that was the issue but I just tried 1278 instead of 1278.65 and it worked. I spent 2 hours dicking round with this last night lol... 
Whether it was fees or not you made me think to use a lesser amount, so thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:42:15
Looking like a fuck up ATM but thems the odds innit.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:34:36
Bitcoin would need to triple for you to make 150 profit on 50 dollar investment.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:14:46
That's where I've been lucky as currently it keeps dipping. If that ceases to happen then I will be kicking myself for sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:30:23
Are you a bot?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:11:15
I used to use quick bt but its fees ridiculous. I just started using coinsquare.io it is much much better.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:32:55
I hear you and you are right on every point, including the "if you're like me" one ;)
As for the next big decline I actually bought my initial investment end of august only to watch it fall 2k in the coming week so that was fun lol.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:53:35
And its on its way back up.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:09:04
Alt coins are shit why would people do that? Its not "people" its those who are trying to get control of bitcoin by creating these forks. You think they don't own large amounts of btc that they can manipulate btc with?
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:18:18
This is the only answer. Call your bank...or give up.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:40:54
Clearly the nape of the neck...gender unknown...
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:16:34
How much do they pay you to post such garbage thoughts?
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:31:25
I can see it happening. Every week more and more places accept it. It will never become a currency for day to day use if the centralised banking cartel is successful. Who will win them or us? Depends on your faith I suppose...
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:55:23
I think that is a noble and just reason to want to make money with bitcoin. It shows responsibility. You have debts, it sucks, you wish you didn't(same boat) but you own them and want to repay them. This is healthy. The idea of debt as a whole is flawed. A system created to create debt slaves. Is bitcoin the answer to some peoples prayers for self reliance? Perhaps...
Best thoughts for your success.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:14:30
Its a scam to kill btc. Forks truly only benefit the central banking cartel.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:48:23
I hope so. Sold last Friday at 7300.(cad) Waiting for the best time to rebuy!
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:13:54
I can't for the life of me figure out how to set a limit order it always says insufficient funds.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:08:52
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:31:39
I'm in Canada not sure how it works here but thanks for the tip. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:18:34
Savage. Have an upvote.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:29:11
Magic 8 ball says so.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:41:56
Jokes are normally funny.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:28:17
Now fall to 4k then shoot to 7k please.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:19:59
Call your bank...tell them it isn't fraud you want to buy some btc baby!
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:38:42
Yes. Buy dodge.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:07:08
That's what I was thinking. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:40:13
All these forks are an orchastraded attack on bitcoin to devalue, delegitimise, and ultimately centralise and control or even kill it. It is real simple to see...
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:46:19
They are but that. The tables turned some time ago. An attack of an annoying mesquito is still an attack, protect your blood.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:46:32
I would rock this hat.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:22:20
How low will it go?
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:32:55
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:46:59
This guy wokes...
Except for the attack to start. Educate without attack.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:42:17
Dodgecoin is looking great today! I just transferred all my btc to dodge!
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:20:54
2:15 pm tomorrow
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:06:22
I made 3 trades. Wouldn't say I spent much time on it at all.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:44:58
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:23:07
You missed the cut off by 5 minutes :(
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:27:56
Lol total fud.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:21:42
10k, 20k, MOON!
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:54:48
I don't understand the question so I guess I'm not watching 5820 whatever 5820 may be.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:20:58
