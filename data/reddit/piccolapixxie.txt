Scale security accordingly. If it’s a BIG stash, it should take YOU at least 24hrs to access it. Trezor with a pin code, stored in a banks vault + 2 copies of the seed, split and hidden somewhere stealth, maybe in the pages of a book given to a family member, etc. The split seed should be unrecognisable scrambled in a poem, penned into random pages of a book. Make sure a few family members know how to access the coins in an emergency, but it would involve them combining the split seed. If it’s a smaller stash, hidden safe with a trezor + seed split, hidden and given to family members.
Think adversarially, have counter measures. Be armed, have a dummy safe, with a dummy small stash trezor, make a trip switch like this one 
Most importantly, don’t go on reddit and tell everyone how you secure your coins!

There is not an atmosphere of FOMO, your intuition is trying to tell you something. Buy, stash, wait 3 years, no matter what don’t sell.

It was inside the PARENTHESES (plural).
If there had been only one parenthesis, the comma could not have been inside it.
