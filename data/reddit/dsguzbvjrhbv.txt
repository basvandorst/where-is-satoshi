This looks like advice from someone who wants to sell high and tries to get you to help him at that

There is a thinking error behind this. Unlike a house or a bag of rice something like bitcoin has no typical price range to which it can be expected to return. Where it was in the recent past says nothing about the short term or long term future. It may soar way beyond previous peaks or fall and never again come close to the value of today or do anything else. There is no "dip". There is just today's price and an unforeseeable future

"The" yellow vests are not calling for anything. They have different agendas and no leaders. That's why trying to negotiate with them is so difficult. This guy is just one of many and he made a video. He has lots of views but that doesn't necessarily mean lots of supporters

Unfortunately that's not how it works. New demand of power does accelerate infrastructure in order to meet but not exceed it, so nothing is gained there.
The ecological cost of power is very different for different power sources but even for the greenest of them it doesn't come near zero.
Renewable isn't necessarily green, especially for hydropower (which is most of the very cheap power). The good places where strong hydropower can be made with moderate impact are all taken, so what is left to build are places where you can get little power for destroying vast stretches of river ecosystem
Power is on one network and one market. Demand anywhere leads to more production everywhere. I have never heard about bitcoin miners with their own power source unconnected from the network
