Great response! I still feel that bitcoin being so volatile is what stops a lot of people that I know from using it.

I've usually gotten past the idea that bitcoin is "worth" something when explaining it to other people. It is at the point that Bitcoins --&gt; USD fluctuates and that they don't feel comfortable receiving bitcoins when there is a chance for those bitcoins to devalue. Fiat currency does not fluctuate as much as bitcoin.
There is also the whole issue with there being no fees when really there are a lot of fees getting money in and out of a bitcoin exchange. 
The last thing I have to say is that bitcoins were really starting to spread to physical retailers/food and stopped and started going down. Bitcoin is not accepted in a lot of places and to the casual user bitcoin becomes useless to them.

I really support Blockchain except for the fact that it is a wallet stored on servers. They do have a lot of security options and let you download the wallet for backup as well, but I only trust these services with small sums of money.
I personally use Blockchain on my phone to carry Bitcoins with me just like a regular wallet (which like in a regular wallet I wouldn't have a crazy amount of money). I find it to be the best option for smartphones.

So you have shares in sdice right now? It just seems like there has been a steady decrease and never going up. You don't think the value of BTC has any effects on the share price or like how the others said the value of BTC affecting the amount of users playing on sdice?

They should just make the customer pay the PayPal fees.

From what I understand, those "backup codes" are only provided by Google for their products. I have yet to see a site besides Google to provide those backup codes.

Has it ever gotten this low before? I only see last 90 days and now it's at .12

That's not what I see happening with Ubuntu. More and more often I see it being used in Educational institutions and in the workplace. You may be up for a surprise. ;)

If you sold at .2 you didn't make any money besides dividends. You would just get back the same USD equivalent that you put into the shares in BTC and in the end could have made more just holding your BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:20:32
HA. I literally laughed out loud. Thanks for that.

Yeah, if they show you the 80-bit key then you can print/copy that too or just save that QR code with the key in it. What ever floats your boat.

No, because a DDoS is just a botnet of "zombie" computers that someone has gained control of. So if your computer is running this malware you could be part of the botnet. The botnet is then controlled by this one person and now even done through TOR (instead of hacked servers) in order to hide who is actually controlling it. So all a site sees is a bunch of IP addresses from everywhere in the world because the attacker told his botnet to flood a specific IP. There are other ways to increase this traffic such as DNS reflection and other clever methods and that is why DDoS is hard to fight off--unless you are [Cloudflare]( ;)

I actually emailed them yesterday and they said that they are reviewing the legal implications of Bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:38:32
So as BTC gains value I should expect to loose value in my shares?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:23:25
Is this a rhetorical question because if not I don't really know about the event. Disruption does not necessarily mean it was a DDoS.

1. Go to bitfloor.com
2. Enter email and password
3. Login and press deposit
4. Enter amount to deposit.
5. Go to Bank of America with your phone or printed instructions and give them your money
6. Receive funds under 30min and start buying bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:30:52
Hmm looks interesting. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-13 20:19:37
You misunderstood me. Try going to: bitcoinrunner.com (exactly like that).
If the "www" is NOT included then it doesn't work. Their DNS record is missing an entry for when people don't include the "www"
edit: not missing an entry, but have an entry that is pointing to the wrong place.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:33:21
+1 for bitfloor. I literally went to the bank, got home and my funds where in my account, bought bitcoins, and sent them to wallet. Did I mention that it all took around 30min? Bitcoin goodness!

Makes sense...for the share price to go up really high like at .7 would sdice just need more users and higher profits? People would see those profits and then want to get in with a piece of that?
