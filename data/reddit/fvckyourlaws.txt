Why do you need your big blocks and everything on-chain if the nodes are run in corporate buildings? Get a grip, the off-chain transactions through LN are a much better tradeoff and way more decentralized than the former option.

Also very relevant to this thread:

No lol
Reddit is Tor friendly
Can you see the pic? I found another host for HD images, if it doesnt work I will try again creating another post, if anyone else can see it just do it yourself in imgur or something.
edit: ok fuck it, i will delete this and try again with the other host, let's hope it works, anyone feel free to download and share picture

I can't believe there are morons out there risking a hard fork, centralization of nodes, AND losing this guy as a developer just to pay sightly smaller fees until we have the LN working.

LN is not centralized, go study.
The question here is, why would you want all transactions on-chain if nodes are centralized? Exactly.

pic says "rushing things"
It's understood that it means "eventually maybe just not now".
Also im tired of trying to find a fucking place to host the image since imgur blocks tor. It's working for me now.

No, see this:

Feel free to re-upload to imgur and make another post, I can't do it because imgur has banned Tor. I can't find any other place to host HD images that will allow Tor. For some reason sometimes the link doesn't work in infotomb.com
