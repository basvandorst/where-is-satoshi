So you’re saying that gross of Tamagochi I have been hanging on to isn’t going to make me ruler of my own continent some day?

In a few years, .00053 may actually buy a Lambo...

No worries. I just don’t want people hitting up the many fine ladies O the night that you can find on the strip and end up running afoul of the law. ��
Metro don’t give two shits if “you thought it was legal”. Brother is LVMPD and they haul in tourist Johns all the time.

In the process of building one on a 3b+ with 7" screen and 1TB HDD.
Hit a wall on power of all things... The 2.5A supply that came with the case I bought just isn't quite cutting it. Can't seem to get all the way through startup.
But I have a 3.5A showing up tomorrow... Excited to get this thing moving.
I know it's not going to make me a ton of money but it's a fun project and nice to be a part of something beneficial.

On the contrary... Prostitution is legal in every county in Nevada BUT Clark county, where Vegas lives.
You have to go out into the wasteland to get legally fucked for money...
On the other hand, growing up there, you learned how to NOT get fucked OUT of money. I dumped my house about a year before the rug got yanked out. Had friends who were upside down 50%+ on houses they had bought near the peak. Scary stuff...
