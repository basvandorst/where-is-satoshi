No, Bitcoin's 'market cap' is 200 billion, but that is a number determined based on the current price. The total USD invested into Bitcoin is far from 200 billion. 
Tether on the other hand has a fixed price, and actually has a market cap of 1 billion, with just that much USD invested in it (on paper).
A crash of tether would have a much larger impact on Bitcoin than your analogy of 1 vs 200 implies.

Bitcoin != all cryptocurrencies. There are already many much more scaleable cryptocurrencies, you just have to look beyond bitcoin.

Only from what I've read on here and on /the_don.. I mean /btc, so I probably know nothing true about him, but I also don't give a shit. I won't ever compare perfectly legal trading to an actual attack threatening people, regardless of the popular delusions here.

This 'if we survive this attack we'll only be stronger after' line is so retarded - regardless of the context it's used in - that I find it truly unbelievable that people still keep regurgitating it.
First of all the event of an attack means that a vulnerability was spotted that prompted someone to attack. Furthermore, even if one survives an attack, any damage sustained during the attack **weakens** them. 
In the case of bitcoin, you can keep parroting how this shows strength, but the only thing it shows is uncertainty and instability. If BCH can regularly mount attacks that slow down the BTC network visibly, it does the exact opposite of strengthening BTC and people's confidence in it.

Nobody attacked nobody, the retardation on this sub is truly insane. We are talking about trading currencies, moving money. He (and everyone else) is free to do whatever he wants with his money and to hold it in whatever currency he likes.
He didn't attack anyone, and if you've lost your livelihood because of the recent events you are retarded for having that much of your worth in a crazy unstable asset.

No, I bought into btc as an investment to make money off of it. Currently, I personally have absolutely no use for a censorship resistant currency, I am in it to make a profit.
Most people here also are, and if they all sold their coins and mining hardware and GTFO as you suggest, you 'super-committed believer hardcore' would have a pretty bad time. Not that I would sell just because you tell me to, of course.

And BTC by Bitmain/Blockstream, so remove that as well then.

Where 'compromised' = not focused exclusively on bitcoin.
Bunch of retards here, jesus.
