Isn't a raspberry capable of doing this? That would be much cheaper (and lower power consumption).

How do we measure this actually? one address =/= one person. I have hundreds of addresses with little amounts for example.

And bigger blocks

I did not record footage at the time, so it is kinda hard to pinpoint. Yes the app is usable if you have just a few (or 1 maybe) peer 2 peer connections, but when I tried to release I got an error message that I needed to get 8 connections to release.
I don't need the security deposit anymore, but if you insist on sorting this out I will make time for you.

My experience with bisquare sucked, here is why:
multiple times buyers grew impatient and opened a dispute, while sepa takes 1 or 2 business days. So even though everything went well I did lose the 'dispute fee' or whatever it is called.
Another few times I couldn't release the coins because I wasn't able to connect to more than 4 nodes, you need 8 to release.

Been out of the loop, why did they not charge fees in the beginning? I mean they have to make money somehow.

Oke this is how the last time went: I sold btc for sepa. After a few days I got the amount so I wanted to release, but the client had already opened a dispute a few hours ago, since I got the money I told the arbitrator to close in her favor (apparently you can do this without losing the deposit?). So I lost the security deposit of 0.01 btc. Not worth it to trade since the total amount was just 0.05 btc. Consider it my tuition fee I guess.

That was in august 2016. I launched it today and it seems much better now.

I got excited by bitcoin in early 2013, and I read so much about it. Always looking at the price, articles and news about new mining gear. Even though I was never going to mine myself, it was still interesting to see how technology progressed. And to watch gold-crazed bitcoiners make wild decisions. But after a while it just got boring for me. I still check in every now and then, and still pay with bitcoin when possible, but I just lost interest. So your obsession will pass, trust me.

I used it personally but it is a ghost town. Sellers do not reply so I am not buying. There have been incidents with scam moderators before. But the first point will probably be addressed if the user-base grows.
