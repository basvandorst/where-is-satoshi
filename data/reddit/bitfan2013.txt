The filing explains that the crypocurrency was “traceable to the illegal sale of software,” and lists the dates when the Bitcoin was purchased from Coinbase.com using a Wells Fargo WFC +0.66% Bank account tied to the software scam. Yang opened the bank account under the business name “Technolutions,” and that account is the “suspected accounting firm for virtually all of the businesses opened and operated by Yang” and his co-conspirators, according to the filing. It isn’t clear how the cryptocurrency was allegedly used in software scam, and the DOJ declined to comment.

Steve123, I agree with you. I too would like to see Bitcoin as an everyday currency that your can purchase like an Apple Itunes card, and I hope to see that day soon, an Internationally accepted card to you can activate on the go.  Our solution is not all or nothing. And we actually are not just looking for the exchanges but for the average person that wants to convert their USD to BTC in an easy and fast fashion. Its not about Bitcoin being a stock, bond or a commodity, it about it being available when you want it, and the more that we have people being able to access it the easier it would be for merchants, suppliers, employees to accept it.  It's a big circle.  We got to start somewhere...

If that happens, and there are funds in the existing address that you just duplicated, then you would be able to control the existing funds.

TL;DW:  this is actually a very good video showing Steveia Barnes, the CA DFI commissioner the same one that sent the letter out to the Bitcoin Foundtion, explaining the MTA (Money Transmission Act) regulation in California.  It shows how hard it really is to become licensed in the U.S since in the age of the internet if you deal with customers that are located at any state in the union you need to be licensed individually at that state as well. There is no universal license. 
She also shows how difficult it would be since you need to match your company's assets to the amount of money you may handle. So if you are an exchange in CA and you have $10 million in customers funds you would need to match that in liquid assets of your own, or qualify for a very expensive surety bond that will cover you.  
So the way I see it, they can't regulate any company outside of the U.S but they are looking at ways to regulate and fine companies that deal with CA based customers, in the name of consumer protection of course.
Didn't get to your portion of the video yet , will try again tomorrow... If you can't fight them, find away around them, that's what water does. Good Night...

I agree with you that given enough time and enough Bitcoin users we could just transact with Bitcoin, but until this happens people would still need a way to buy Bitcoins and the only way now is to convert it from Fiat to Bitcoin. The Voip minutes will not actually be used but swapped back and forth as a way to convert BTC to Fiat currency.

Original Post:
TLDR: Reposted from Friday Conversation
1) OP comes from a family of bankers
2) Banks aren't afraid of bitcoin, the KYC/AML laws are the problem.
3) Too many unaccounted for funds can cause a huge penalty
4) Main problem is bitcoin&lt;--&gt;fiat
5) OP's Solution: An international bitcoin bank in panama where fraudulent activity within a specific account could be dealt with individually instead of screwing everyone (i.e. bitfloor, bitcoin-24)
6) A personal bank account, with online access would be opened in your name, a debit/visa/mc would be issued and you and only you would have control and access to this account
7) Internal bank exchange from BTC to your currency would be performed instantly with other bank account holders though an escrow instant account to provide anonymity.
8) The Bank will act as any other bank as far as Fiat is concerned but will also provide you with the option to convert your Currency into BTC at any time from multiple open exchanges that will open accounts with the bank.
I Started a discussion on Friday about the challenges Bitcoin was facing when it came to exchanges
and I was overwhelmed by the great response by mostly everyone on Friday's post. 
So we are now taking the option of opening a Pure Fiat - Virtual Currency Bank very seriously and would like to know the following:
1) What Features, Capabilities would you like to see in a Bitcoin - Fiat Bank? 
2) What would you not want?
Your input is important to our Business Structure.

Inflation of a currency is not solely influenced by the increase of supply. It is mostly influenced by its purchasing power year over year or CPI. As you can see in Venezuela or Argentina, their inflation was caused due to their currency value against other currencies. Bitcoin is currently very deflationary compared to its Value last year. Simply put the Bitcoins you held last year can purchase you a lot more dollars today.

That was my suggestion to our Bank, but you need to remember that the compliance of the bank to each account exposes it to all other account holders. HSBC was fined as a whole, not per account. And Banks face this threat on a regular basis with each and every movement of funds through its network.

Why does the Nikkei go up 50% in 6 months and then down 25% in 2 weeks. Why not... Human nature is to over reach, over react and over inflate everything. People always think 10 times over should I buy this stock or that stock, should I purchase Bitcoin at that price or wait. 
But when it is time to sell anything from Stocks to Real Estate to Bitcoin people make that decision a lot faster. Review all assets charts for any commodity or stock, it always rises slowly over time compared to the abrupt sell off that follow.
It is natural. The value of Bitcoin is not related to the price of the BTC/USD it is in the trust that we place in it when I transfer 1 BTC or 1000 BTC from my wallet to yours. Whenever you choose to convert it back to fiat is up to you, and at any moment you may profit or lose based on your timing. 
Buy or Mine Bitcoins because you believe in their application, not because they may or may not be worth $1000 tomorrow.

All of your concerns have been brought up before, over the past 4 years repeatedly. But somehow Bitcoin just keeps on taking a licking and keeps on ticking... Despite all of your great points, the people that keep buying Bitcoins don't necessarily do it because of what BTC to USD is today or tomorrow, but because they believe in its core protocol, they trust the technology, and they love the freedom this technology provides them with.  Its not about the black market buddy, it is about the free market... Check previous posts from 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and of course after the big run up this year, they all said Bitcoin is toast, but here we are still running the miners, still Buying and Selling and still believing that a decentralized currency is better than a fake controlled fiat one...

The problem was with USD and the Bitfloor structure to accept customer funds. There was no clear guidelines to deal with at the time. I believe that now the Bitcoin community as a whole are better equipped to handle customers funds.

Either way you should still trust in Bitcoin as the issue was never with it.

We are talking about actually starting a bank for Bitcoin users, TradeHill, MtGox, and all the other exchanges still rely on various banks to approve their Main account and at any time reserve the right to revoke it. Trust me when I tell you that one letter from a regulator will freeze those accounts in a second, since no bank want to be held liable. The only viable long term solution would be to establish a bank entity that would be strong enough to care about the account and face the regulators.

As far as we would be concerned, we would operate the Bank the same as any other Bank which opens personal and business accounts on an individual basis. The only difference is that BTC Exchange operators will also be able to open an account with us and offer their services to the Bitcoin community as a whole.  That means that you transfer your funds to XE trade company's account place your order for BTC, get BTC to your wallet, and vice versa when selling the BTC the funds will go directly and locally to your account with our Bank. The funds will not stay with the Exchange but will be privately held by you in your account controlled by you. So at any given time the Exchange account only acts as an escrow funds.

I agree; The more publicity Bitcoin gets the more the interest grows. Every person that Buys, Mines bitcoins becomes an instant shareholder in the Bitcoin economy, and profits or losses based on market price. They also become instant advocates spreading the benefits of Bitcoins around to their friends and family. You can see its exponential growth the same way that Facebook and Skype exploded on the scene. However with Bitcoin the incentive to use it is much greater, as it is a monetary incentive. Your wealth grows as the network of users grow and therefore demand for it grows raising its value.

every stock starts with low liquidity on the OTC Market then as it grows it moves to bigger and bigger exchanges. Bitcoin started with one transaction, it grows and expand over time. There is no issue that it is limited, it is infinitely divisible. Gold has a limited supply and is only mined at an average rate over time, yet for over 5000 years it has been the standard.  More and more merchants are accepting Bitcoins everyday. Buy some today and join the cult ; the water is fine!

By being a Licensed Financial Services company we will be able to offer our customers the following services:
1.	A Private Individual/Corporate International Bank account 
2.	Support for more than 20 different Fiat Currencies; USD, JPY, EUR etc.
3.	The option for a Visa Debit Card with the ability to withdraw funds at any ATM worldwide

Any funds that you receive into your account by selling BTC through one of the exchanges would be transferred into your own personal or corporate bank account that you have opened with the bank. The transaction of the funds movement between the Exchange and your account will be recorded. So if you are planning to transfer or receive funds that you couldn't really account for in the event that a proof of funds is made then this account is not for you. It is for legitimate consumers, trades and merchants of the Bitcoin Economy.

@_date: 2013-08-12 15:32:00
That is right! A few months ago we thought that the easy way was to just open an account for an exchange at our Bank. But over the past few months with new regulation and AML/KYC etc. coming into place we decided to form a Financial service company from scratch that will handle all regulation and open up our services to any qualified secure exchange that would want to offer their exchange platform to our customers. We created an incentive for profit sharing with exchanges so that both sides will be able to profit.
Edit: We also decided that we need to keep it separate as to allow our Customer Service, accountants, tech support all be able to understand the services we offer. We couldn't mix the same customer service that helps you with your mortgage and  credit cards with customer calling to see if their funds were transferred to a crypto currency exchange. Also we had to bring in a lot more English speaking personal. 
So here we are..

In addition to putting you in control of your identity and communication, BitShares will put you in control of your money by making Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies as easy to use as Paypal while being more secure than even Bitcoin is today.    This is made possible by using the BitShares ID system and communication system to automatically and securely negotiate payment address with everyone on your contact list.   Users of the BitShares Wallet interface will never have to see a Bitcoin address again because sending money to someone is literally as easy as sending them an e-mail.  Select a contact, enter an amount, click send.

The Bank would only be in charge of the Fiat currency and offer currency exchange services USD - EUR - JPY etc.. As far as Bitcoin is concerned you should keep it in cold storage until you want to trade it, then send it to one of the approved exchanges and sell it in the open market. Once your order is filled the funds will enter your Bank account. So there shouldn't be a lot of Bitcoins stored with the exchange.  And btw we do offer gold storage in some of our banks safe.

The difference will be that with Gox your money is in their account. With us your money will be in your own account and only when you choose to trade into Bitcoin you would move money internally and instantly within our Bank to an exchange account for instant trade. So your money is not bundled in one Exchange account and you don't need to wait for approval from Dwolla or the Exchange to move money in and out, It is your own Bank account.

@_date: 2013-08-11 20:11:46
"BSA" AML/KYC/SAR FACTA are all standard terms that financial companies dealing with any American citizens/business must follow regardless of the jurisdictions they are based out of. We will only deal with Fiat and will open bank accounts for our customers that choose to transfer their Fiat funds to any of the several exchanges that will offer Crypto to Fiat and vice versa conversion. The same way you transfer fiat to mtgox from your bank account but without the lag of wire transfers in and out. We will derive revenue from both in and out wire fees plus profit sharing with exchanges that partner with us to offer their services to our pre-approved customers. AML/KYC verification will take place at the time the account is opened just like at any bank. 
We feel that it is the best way to take the regulation liability away from the exchanges and let them concentrate on running the Software Platform instead.

The Bitcoin Foundation does great work for the Bitcoin Community.

Like when a new movie comes out, all you see everywhere in every show and related products everyone talking about that movie.  We need a large Public Relation company that counteracts the unfair allegations and rumors that Bitcoin sometimes gets. But I don't think it should be a central foundation, rather a decentralized one where Bitcoin advocates connect with Local PR firms and promote Bitcoin..

This is just another example why doing Business in the U.S is just getting too expensive and cumbersome. Lawyers constantly adding a hidden "Tax" on Business in the form of extra litigation, hoping to settle out of court and enrich themselves. We all have been aware of the struggles that any Bitcoin Business has been facing, and I personally believe that Bitinstant was never out to "cheat" or "enrich" themselves. They saw a need for a Business in the market place and tried to fill that need. Anyone dealing with any Bitcoin business knew that nothing was perfect and that we are all going through "growing pains" just like any new industry goes through in its infancy. I am sure Charile Shrem like any other entrepreneur tried is best to navigate the turbulent uncertain waters of the Bitcoin world to best serve his customers.

Since all the customers of our approved Exchange will have opened an account with our Financial Services company, all AML/KYC /SAR regulation will be performed by us and therefore negate the responsibility of the Exchange for such regulation. Allowing the Exchanges to concentrate on the technology side of the business and offer better trading platform to accommodate the demand of the global market place. A simple one click integration will allow our customers to integrate with the Exchange Platform, the same way Facebook or Google integrates today with other web sites and services.
In essence the Exchange platform will serve our customers when it comes to trading Fiat to Crypto Currency and vice versa, the same way a Stock trading platform company provides the software, but the Financial Services Company (“Broker”) represent the customers and takes care of the regulation side of the business.

The Bank will operate as any other Bank, and in addition Open Exchanges will be able to open bank accounts with the Bank as well as allowing you to buy and sell Bitcoins through the exchanges. The bank will not buy and sell you Bitcoins, but will allow a fast instant internal transaction between your own personal bank account and the exchange, so you could get your funds in and out of the exchange at will.

The issues that many Banks and Institutions face in the U.S is that "The customer is always right" so no matter which way you transfer funds in the U.S, via Credit Card, Bank Transfer, Check etc. it is always reversible with a simple dispute. That is why Bitcoin is so popular with Merchants local and International that are tired of providing goods and services just to see it being sucked right out of their account a month later because a customer thought they will get x instead of y.

I agree that many people in Cyprus were not able to convert to Bitcoin.

You could set up an accounting company and do your own accounting and charge yourself in Bitcoins for said service, then deduct the cost and pay yourself as the owner of the company in bitcoins and deduct that.

All Good Points:
1) You can keep your funds at the currency of your choice. Panama does use the USD as its official currency but all International Bank Account can keep their funds at the currency of their choice.
2) The fees depend on your bank when you transfer here. And the fees to transfer out would be lowered to Bitcoin customers. I can't specify now as it will depend on Volume.
3) Panama is known for its Banking Financial Services It is the HQ of over 70 Multinational Corporations and Trade. There are no restrictions on the amount of money to be transferred. As long as don't arrive with suitcases full of cash to the branch.
4)Panama has a territorial tax structure, so if you did not make any money from Panamanian related business dealings you will not be subject to local taxes or reporting.  Once you transfer the funds back to your country it is up to you to find out the laws locally.
5) All banks are insured and regulated by the local Panamanian version of the FDIC

IMHO Bitcoin is still in its infancy, just learning how to crawl. We have seen hugh growth in the adoption of new users over the past few months. It took Credit Cards decades to infiltrate the market place. The growth will come from merchants accepting Bitcoin as a payment at an additional discount. This will incentives their customers to obtain Bitcoin for an easier anonymous transaction. The designation of BTC, mBTC or any other will happen organically. No one last year could have predicted the value of Bitcoin today.  I enjoy sitting back and experiencing everything that Bitcoin is.

You are not required to store your money with our Bank. We would simply open a bank account in your name, and when you choose to you can fund this account or remove funds from this account, the same as your current bank account.  And there could be many banks setup this way not just one. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 22:54:41
That would be the eventual goal, where the Bank would act as a market maker and just convert your funds to BTC and vice versa.  The same way your Bank currently converts USD - to any other currency, they don't place your money in a forex account, they just honor the current maket price. But in order to get there we would need enough liquidity in the market place to fill this request.

1) OP comes from a family of bankers
2) Banks aren't afraid of bitcoin, they love the idea of it. The KYC/AML laws are the problem.
3) Too many unaccounted for funds can cause a huge penalty
4) Main problem is bitcoin&lt;--&gt;fiat
5) OP's Solution: An international bitcoin bank in panama where fraudulent activity within a specific account could be dealt with individually instead of screwing everyone (i.e. bitfloor, bitcoin-24)
6) A personal bank account, with online access would be opened in your name, a debit/visa/mc would be issued and you and only you would have control and access to this account
7) Internal bank exchange from BTC to your currency would be performed instantly with other bank account holders though an escrow instant account to provide anonymity.
8) The Bank will act as any other bank as far as Fiat is concerned but will also provide you with the option to convert your Currency into BTC at any time from any exchanges that will open accounts with the bank.

Crypto Financial
Some background:
Members of this company are currently board members in a Medium size bank in Panama.
A few month ago, while Bitcoin was a daily occurrence on the international news, we were approached
with the idea of opening a Bitcoin Exchange account for a potential customer. We examined the idea very carefully
at the time, but were unable to see any potential long term profits for our bank in doing so.
1. The exchange would need to be licensed to be able to handle third party funds on behalf of their customers
2. Funds would just flow in and out from the exchange, leaving us with all the paperwork associated
3. The cost associated with due diligence of verifying and accounting for funds sent in and out internationally would exceed any transfer fees we may charge.
Due to those restrictions and many more we declined the account for this exchange.
Another idea was formed that may be more beneficial to both sides. We explored the option of not only charging in and out wire fees, but to actually
set up a new entity that will be licensed to handle third party funds and open accounts on their behalf, similar to a hedge fund or stock broker. This 
new Financial Services company (Crypto Financial) would open and manage the accounts within our Bank but will handle all of the AML/KYC/SAR portion for these customers.
The revenue will be generated by charging fees plus and more importantly by charging a flat percentage fee from the various exchanges that would choose to open an account with
us and offer the Exchange Platform to our pre-approved customers. So we came up with:
[center][b]Exchanges Profit Sharing Incentive[/b][/center]
Many of the current exchanges that deal with Fiat to Crypto Currencies are not currently licensed or equipped to handle the regulatory environment. These Exchanges are great in developing the software platform necessary to carry out and execute a trade between Fiat and Crypto Currency, but are unable to handle the need to verify and manage their customer’s funds in an appropriate manner. They were not setup as a Financial Services company and therefore lack the experience needed to comply with Banking rules and laws associated with Fiat Currencies. With the regulation over Crypto Currency ever expanding, the Exchanges need to concentrate on providing the software and not on hiring expensive lawyers, accountants and AML/KYC personal full time to sift through each transaction coming in and out of their system.
Our solution is to provide the Exchanges with pre-approved customers that they will not be required to verify. The same way a Stock broker handles and manages their customers account, and the actual trades are performed by a trading platform software provided by a third party; so will we offer our customers the ability to choose their own trading platform provided by the exchanges. As the Exchange companies will only offer software, their liability for reporting and compliance will be void and null.
We will offer several exchanges the opportunity to bid for and open an account with our company. Each Exchange platform company will be able to offer their own rates and fees for access to their platform to our customers. This will encourage competition among the different exchanges and offer our customers a choice when choosing an exchange. This will also encourage innovation for the Exchange Platform as the Exchanges will compete and will want to attract our customers by offering the best Trading Platform and Best Rates. The same way the free market dictates the rates offered by different Stock Brokers or Forex agents.
That way both the Bank and the Exchange benefit from each trade preformed, allowing us to share in the revenue and cover the cost of Account Maintenance and compliance.

I had a reservation for 1 of the 1.5 TH rigs they used to advertise for during Feb/2013. Even spoke on the phone with BFL to confirm my order was received by them prior to wiring the funds to their account. They reassured me several times that they will start shipping in 2 weeks and that by April I should have my order. I stood in line in the Bank looking at my filled out paperwork to hand to the Bank Teller and I don't know how to explain it, but a bad feeling just came over me telling me that I should not send the money. I decided to go with my gut feeling and instead picked up a few ASICMiner pass through shares.  I feel bad for everyone that did fall for the 2 weeks out the door misinformation. I am sure BFL meant to meet their obligations, but to cancel an order for someone that has waited in line for more than a year. Just bad business practice IMO.

In my opinion, I think they couldn't account for the fiat funds that flowed in and out of their Bank Account.

It is very well done as you can substitute $ for anything else in the market place, Oil, coffee futures, JPY or BTC and it sounds like any news report floating around now a day.  Love those guys from the TOR project.. JK Onion..
Edit: due to the high cost of dollars if anyone please have some dollars for sale I would gladly pay $100, that is $10 higher than the current going rate. Please PM asap!

Remember that you can always setup an Offshore Corporation that you control but is not in your name and open a Bank Account that way. (Keep that "Just Between Us"). Any company dealing in International trade uses that to Manage their funds offshore.(Ask Google, Apple and GE and the other almost 2 Trillion dollars that is seating offshore due to taxes)

I did review those links, but as far as I know no one as actually acted upon those ideas.  And who said their should only be one Community Union Bank, the more the better. (I'm a capitalist)
