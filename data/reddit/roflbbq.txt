Calling it a cesspool is pretty subjective. Point me to another subreddit that went out of it's way to donate thousands of dollars to charity on it's own. The only other subreddit that did something like that was and it was in response to Total around 50k

Yeah, that does change things. Dirty

Hiding the score doesn't prevent it from being downvoted or upvoted. Comments still have scores, they are just hidden to users.

Dismantled implies it's no longer there. It's still there man. Click the link. It works. 
Politics has also been removed as a default.

Okay guys, I really just lurk here because I find it interesting, but I do hold a very small amount of bitcoin. I've seen bunches of posts talking about a split of some sort over the past weeks. Can someone point me to something that explains to me what's going on like I'm a moron?

Yeah, I guess I was slightly off. It's not a flair, but you can hover over everyone's user name and see account creation date.

This account is a bot? It's new and reads just like one other than this comment

This actually hurts your front page view of reddit if that matters to you. There's a specific number, and I think it's 100, where if you're subscribed to more than that number of subreddits the frontpage is limited to a random selection of your subscriptions. So if you're subscribed to 120 subreddits, you would only see a selection of random 100 chosen. I think having gold increases the number
