Aren't fees the same? Thought it was just a %?

Because credit card has chargeback protection and reward points. If it's going to be same price as paying with BTC, then of course buyer will opt for credit card. Give a discount on the price, and buyers might start thinking. Sellers already have to pay a 3% fee, if that starts translating to BTC transactions that might change things.

Topic: 1 Realization -  What if I sell my bitcoins but do not withdraw the proceeds from the exchange?
In regards to Mtgox and USA residents, I don't see how it's considered realized. First you have to go through a long verification process. Then get your bank confirmed. Both steps take 1-2 months. Then there's no way to withdraw USD. This is verified all over the Internet. There hasn't been a confirmed withdrawal since June 2013. I'd say report it for FBAR, but you can't even use Mtgox USD to pay for taxes.

Where did you sell that you can withdraw any amount over $1000 to your bank account? Every exchange I go to has a ridiculous number of regulations for USD.

Thanks. Didn't know about that. It would still be nice to have 1-2 online backups or undo last import or undo last delete.
The problem I had was there was a mistake somewhere on the fee currency. I believe I had entered the correct altcoin fee on a .csv file, but ended up still being BTC. And then I had to manually adjust every trade. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to investigate whether that was a mistake on my end or not.

If bitcoin.tax had a way to "Select All" to delete a goup of trades and Save Files to backup your trades in case you screw things up, then it would be perfect.

But there's no way to explain how $250 x 50 BTC went to 25 BTC unless you detail the "like-kind trades." of how that happened. I suppose you basically can show capital gains now or later. But either way you'll have to show that path.

I'm worried that by not reporting, trade history from Mtgox or other exchanges might reach the IRS. I know the chances are extremely slim. I think Bitcoin Builder, Coinbase, and Bittrex are in the US? Not sure.

It's debatable whether you need to show that right now. I've asked US exchanges if altcoin to altcoin trades need to be reported and they wouldn't comment without consulting an attorney. But I don't want to detail how 1 BTC went through 5 years of altcoins to come back 0.00001. The government would think I was money laundering! haha
