Well, that was an alarmist slew of nonsense to throw out there.
Yeah, yeah...technically you're right. Technically I could be jailed in some jurisdictions for jaywalking. But in actual practice, not so much.
Plausible deniability, I believe is the term.
That child porn case you're referring to was the one with the police officer that taunted the investigators saying stuff like, "I am not giving the password...and you'll never get in to my device!"
Wrong answer.
The CORRECT answer is always, "I smoked a large amount of marijuana, your honor. Out of the paranoia associated with using marijuana, I changed all of my passwords and I cannot recall them after waking up the following morning!"
Prove otherwise.

It's your competition.
Same shit happened on east coast.
Bet you 10 BTC it's a competing ATM company...

Who is talking about the Middle East?
And Venezuela? Have you ever been? 
You would *not* be shot for this.
Get a passport, plz.

I could buy 30 Lambos tomorrow for cash.
No, we don't all want to be *that* douchebag.

I wouldn't say BTC is overvalued right now.
I believe we will swing between $5,500 - $12k for a few more months, however.
We are in the exact same spot we were in 2013. This feels like May 2013, seriously.

Ledger is closed source?
Yeah, fuck that.
Trezor has an amazing team. Stick with them.

I like the guy...but...
Nobody is using ETH for payments. Literally all of actual legit commerce is taking place on the BTC chain.
In the future I suspect this will change. But for now, BTC is how people are trading internationally and making payments. All other coins are 95% speculation driven.
...and yeah, he's high as balls 
Weed...and percs, perhaps?

Always a clown that brings up FDIC.
And what happens in the event of systemic failure where the insurers are insolvent? 
Oh, that's right....they'll just print more of your money, replacing what you lost....but killing your purchasing power in the process.
Don't think this can happen? The next decade is going to teach you something new, my friend.
And then...what about those of us in developing countries where when your money is gone...it really is fucking gone? No FDIC, no nothing. Do we not count?

And you gay.

Well, that sucks! I just lost my erection...

There's always one of you parrots saying something about McAfee and the scat allegation the girls made in that documentary.
Honestly, what do you care what another man does sexually? 
If I could see into your (likely non-existent) sex life, I could call you all sorts of pathetic names, I'm certain.
What another man does with his cock and/or mouth, you care about....why exactly?
Are you secretly gay or something? Because giving 2 fucks about another man's sexual urges sounds kinda....well, gay.
Get a life.

Fact? Tin foil hat?
Here's a fact for you: We came within a few days of an entire bank system failure in the US in 2008 prior to the TARP bailout.
What happens to your *safe and sound* bank account balance when the next administration doesn't approve a bailout?
Hello haircuts.

He did have a guy killed down in Belize.
But the guy that got killed did kill McAfee's dogs.
I mean, I'm not saying McAfee should have killed the guy over it...but I definitely understand.
Don't go around poisoning people's dogs if you don't want a bullet in the fucking face.

Only way I'd switch from Mycelium.

Not anymore it isn't.
Few years ago, sure. Maybe 50% is speculation today.
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:00:22


Yeah, you actually did by trying to assert FDIC as some cure-all for the risk associated with keeping money in a financial institution as an unsecured creditor.
I mean, do you even read anything associated with any of this....or just parrot what you've heard?

Dude, listen to me carefully: The person doing this was hired by a competitor/future competitor that's going to try to inch into your market.
The scumbag Konja brothers of Bitexpress were doing this to operators in Detroit and other areas on the East Coast.
Andrew Konja
Alvin Konja
and others.
Those clowns are probably still at it.
