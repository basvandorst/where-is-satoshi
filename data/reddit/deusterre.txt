Good luck my friend, I'm sure the biggest problem about cryptocurrencies is that people don't buy and sell goods with them, people are just greedy waiting for the price to rise but they're not really making the cryptoeconomy grow healthy. 
I hope you beat hunger, it's horrible fasting for long periods.

Carry an small portable battery, is smaller than a cellphone but will save your life in cases like that or more urgent ones

Wow man thanks a lot! 
That's the biggest transaction ever in my wallet x) be sure I'm going to use this funds to make the interest grow in my city! (dollar has been inflating a lot in my country so I can do a couple of interesting things with this and the amount I had before your help). 
Hope you enjoyed the beer!

You're welcome man, although ppl didn't like my comment but anyway... How disturbed for not having a little sense of humor x_X

That's cool, selling those without accepting bitcoin is like selling cars and not accepting credits (I know, it's a bad analogy but drones come good with bitcoin). 
If you do so, that would make your business more interesting and high tech xD

That would be funny

Ok Comp I will keep that in mind but first of all let me get some good use of these funds you sent me. And hopefully with this would be enough to make some noise! 
I won't take you more time, enjoy your night! x)

That's a real initiative, just it will be important to really reintroduce them to productive society.

And what's your business about?

The problem is making normal people to not fear on and adopt bitcoin. 
That's a serious challenge. 
It's going to be just as normal as debit/credit cards in the near future but right now it's still widely unknown.

There are some tipping bills that you can print (with cool or sober design) with the amount of btc you want to tip; it does everything you are talking about and it has more compact user friendly info about bitcoin. Maybe you should take a look 
Also if you want to promote the use of bitcoin, sell something or offer any service and accept btc as payment. 
Good luck!

Yeah a link would be great and it's a matter of waiting and doing more noise (I.E. Put discount on your products buying in btc but also sell btc on your business). 
Good day!

I'm not that good for math or economy but I know something for sure: your name rocks!

You got a point! 
Sadly a lot of people look for mass adoption because it will rise their total value of their actual coins but not for making the money flow, and that's an envious way of action. 
I provide services and accept this currency as a payment option because I want to experiment and see it grow, and I actually look for places to where expend my coins (at this time only getting credit for my phone calls) and I hope more places accept it someday but I'm not going to push them to do so.
But as long as people force business to accept it but don't really spend on them they will keep ruining the bitcoin popularity.
The best way to really make it grow is to actually use your coins and make others to also want to use them.
