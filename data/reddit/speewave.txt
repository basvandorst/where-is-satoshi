Don't be surprised, People want to do stuff that helps the community. All this is trying to do is raise funds for a legal battle that seems impossible to win (Maybe he'll have a reduced sentence, but i highly doubt he's going to walk away from this). People have their reasons to not donate money, some people just don't care or don't want to donate to a man that they feel doesn't deserve it.

Part of the problem is like they don't know what its like to lose so much, I know i don't. Some dont mine, some work for it in BTC, others, invest or buy bitcoins (either to use or sell) .... Rules of thumb are posted around (Don't trust everyone, Never store money in an exchange, Don't invest more than you're willing to lose)
So when something happens, like theft or this crap with Gox, people start this 'I Told you so' stuff to the point of being dicks. I get the i told ya so's, I get the people who hate the sob story self posts, maybe who even hate the concept of holding someones hand and saying it'll be alright when you don't know that person or the future of bitcoin. I see the skceptisim of it, the "I lost x amount after the drop and i don't know what i'm going to do" and see tips in hopes that it helps and never hear from some people again.
To those who do make those types of comments:
No matter what, stuff like suicide is a serious issue, Even if you think OP is pulling some bitcoin-whoring bullshit, or because OP didn't follow the unwritten laws of the trustless economy, think that OP is human. If theres a suicide post, if you've got nothing to say than ('Should have made a cold wallet', or 'Thats what you get for trusting an exchange to hold money' (or a web wallet, or whatever), remember people are human. 
If you think OPs lying or you hate those posts for whatever other reason, Don't comment something dickish. because you could be wrong. OP could be honest when he says gox screwed him over or that something else caused him to be so distraught. Because when his whole world may seem like its turning to shit, (s)he doesn't need some person on the internet whose only words of are smug and (at times at the wrong light) hateful calling them incompetent.

To me, it seems like you may be confusing Tipping as we do with our servers, and waiters \ waitresses' and just how we've been tipping online..
I've seen people tip others because they felt that maybe an upvote or a compliment just wasn't enough, that they wanted to show how much your comment or post made them either laugh or they agreed with you or learned something because of a post online or something.  
you're not a bad person if you don't tip, but you may make someones day when you do tip

Bitcoin by default is pseudonymous, Want full anonymity? Tor or VPN. Web Wallets usually hide more info as it doesn't say publicly (the wallet service will know, because well, metadata) which IP you sent the transaction from, but will say the ip of the service on the block chain TX (Coinbase does this, but not as anonymous as far as the registration process goes, *But they use their own wallets instead of an actual wallet associated to you, (An internal blockchain if you will) so while you may be sending money from your Coinbase account with a receive address, your money is actually coming from somewhere different, It's quite smart in my opinion, and you may want to look in to it*)
If you like Coinbase's services, Use a Bitmessage to e-mail system (Make BM Adress, Go to a service, new email is BMAdress @ Service.com or something), create a new account on coinbase using that email address, and you should be fine

Just because the money exists in the digital world, doesn't give him immunity for anything he can be held accountable for in a court of law.

Hmm, I've never noticed anything that seemed shady to me, *then again i'm not in there frequently to say accurately or do much really, just to escape the hum-drum of the depressing Gox scheme and now this whole Dorian Nakamoto thing.  
I think the older something becomes the less shady it seems. Cause i really thought doge was some shitty pump&amp;dump alt coin, considering all they did was fork litecoin with a bigger cap and based it off the meme, but it's community has somehow managed to lessen those worries in me at least)
I do agree that it's really full of propaganda, mainly because its so meme based (most people use memes as a form of propaganda, and its so much easier if you're propagandizing a meme to begin with) 
But another part of the propaganda aspect, is just trying to get people to take dogecoin (at least those who are serious about it) just like was when i started checking out bitcoin around this time last year, asking people to spread tips to get more users of the coin and more businesses working on taking it.
The one thing i will say i dislike about the community is the doge based. one can only read *Much give away, many coin, very generous, wow, such crypto*, so many times before wanting to just leave the place (I just don't find doge all that funny, or at least i think it's been over used *something that dogecoin doesn't help with*)

Personally i don't think that theres a system out there that can be implemented to be fully impenetrable by either of these... Not because of technical reasons, but because of trust and humanistic reasons - The point was that Bitcoins cash-like nature, makes it more secure than how it's currently done with Debit\Credit cards... 
The cash analogy works wonders for bitcoin:
 * Money can only be received if someone specifically gives it to you (where as the minute i give you my card info, i'm in a bad place, I trust you, but stuff happens), 
 * Malware can be analogous to Pick-pocketing, an unknown entity taking your money away
 * Breaches happen but damage can be preemptively controlled, Store little in an easy access place - store the rest somewhere safer, even more money - and somewhere where nobody can find it (Source : I was that kid that stored money in a sock drawer and various places in my room) 
As long as you trust the right sites, enable 2FA, you're still safer with bitcoin (Actually with these two things alone - you're safer with multiple sites) than you are with anything else... 
If you worry about breaches - use a offline or hardware wallet, If you need easy access, use a web wallet 
Like i said, Bitcoin isn't * nor,IMO,can it, or anything else really be* 100% secure in all aspects just because human error is a thing - Fail to secure your account enough, and you're more compromised than others...

As far as cold storage, How i've recommended: download Ubuntu Linux, it's another type of System like windows , and can run electrum. Theres a tutorial on how to install it to a flash drive. at some point of the install you can password protect and encrypt your 'home' folder (this is where your wallet would be stored), Install Electrum, generate a new wallet, save that wallet address some where, go back in to windows and move the coins to that address
I recommended ubuntu as you have a fresh, uncompromised install of an operating system that, incase you're worried about something or need to take money out, you don't need to worry about the system's security as you'd never really use that OS on a day to day thing.

Are you on your husbands computer? if so he might've had the software on there if he used it... He may have used whats known as a 'Web Wallet' the one i use is called  i say try there as i too have a 12 word device in case i can't access my wallet or i forget something... They are a very secure place and in my opinion are very trustworthy *Of course don't take my word on it, like one poster said, dont trust anyone*
**HOWEVER: Please try it on electrum first, if that doesn't work for you then resort to this next option:**
If you go on Blockchain.info and click Wallet on the upper bar, there should be a thing that says Alias: (Random numbers and letters) and Password, Assuming he used this site and you're on his computer
If you don't know his password than that Mnemonic (12 words) comes in handy as you can click "Recover Wallet" and you input the 12 words and it should get you on track to making a wallet!
If you don't see the Alias part filled, and your on his computer, he may have cleaned out his cache forcing it not to remember the alias, or if you're not on his computer, this recover wallet thing can still work... you can try typing it in, (The more security consious on here would recommend against that because it's online and of course these words are very valuable as they hold the key to your coins and you should put these in with great caution!) *I'd say this would be the most last ditch effort you could try*

Silk road didn't promote violence. There were accusations (people say they're false, i'm not sure) that he had set up a hit on someone. 
More importantly DPR\SR, while as groundbreaking of an idea that it was, and as much as it showed off how a free market could work over online. By law, it was still illegal. 
By fundraising either a bond or covering legal fees *As i don't care about this project, i don't know what the prime goal is*, it feels like it's more associated with promoting illegal behavior than violence.

By cap i mean coin total, cause its capped of at x amount of coins *iirc its the billions* not actual market capitalization.
Theres a lot more coins out there and they're not worth much , 1 doge is valued around 1/1000th of a US Dollar. So if i tipped you 2000 doge, you'd have around $2! Part of it is a size thing, like some people feel better tipping 500 doge, even if its only $0.50, vs sending that equivilant in BTC or uBTC (although if they measured in uBTC this placebo effect of having more would be different, but i don't think many people care to 0.002543BTC to uBTC)
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:06:57
i would'nt say it's riding the coat-tails of Bitcoin, The thing was Bitcoin was trying to change money in a way that was safer than any other payment option for the net today, Dogecoin copied its code (technically litecoin, but that was a fork of bitcoin) raised the cap and such so there was more money to throw around, I don't think anyone really intended it to be big like bitcoin is or ever could be, but it's community + massive money cap (c'mon, i'd rather have 1 million coins then have one tenth of coin) and lack of seriousness (as in It's based off a meme that everyone knows, its a lighter sense about it) 
It wasn't trying to be the next big payment option for the world, it was a lighthearted community effort that really succeeded (probably more than anyone thought, at least more than i thought it ever would) The Coat-tails speech could be saved for other coins like LTC and PPC (both of which i like, but i see the coat tails speech)
Also on the topic of Coat-Tails, If they weren't meant to be ridden on, why are they accessable to be ridden on? *that was bad i know, but hear me out* Bitcoin, is open sourced under the most permissive licence (that isn't WTFPL or PD), It's meant for people to learn and expand off of, or expand with. Just because someone made a crypto currency based off code and beliefs of another coin isn't bad, it's probably what Satoshi would've wanted, considering the licencing choice. [You could GPL it and make all code share alike among other restrictions, or you could say Closed-source, but with viewable code, Theres tons of restrictive paths to take with the licencing that weren't chosen, for a reason.

I think volatility is the only thing stopping Native BTC prices (ie Saying i want x uBTC instead of $x). because think of the trezor, iirc it was always 1BTC, despite the market fluctuating between $50-1000-$500 by that time. 
As far as immediatley converting to fiat, sure that could be attributed to volatility, but in reality, your biggest thing is companies want fiat, because the whole chain of supplies works via fiat. Companies buy tools &amp; supplies with fiat and pay workers with fiat. so they have to convert practically automatically all the time.

Peercoin seems cool too, with this POS\POW Hybrid system they have going on., among not trying to use a harder encryption for energy concerns, i don't know too much about it but it seems like its up there and i consider it to be a reputable coin.
Doge shocked me because i've never seen anyone be so quick to make new services and such for taking in an altcoin, In the 3 months it existed, Doge had a better web wallet offering and payment processing site (akin to Coinbase), than Litecoin did in its couple years of existance.

i poke my head around there every so often, i will say i think the massive cap lets more tipping happen and just in general the design wasn't to change banking the design was a meme-based coin so it seems more light hearted (at least IMO) The community does seem great *don't get me wrong, is still a good community, although there does seem to be an attitude change (probably cause people are more vocal than others*)

On consumer protection, as smug as it sounds, Part of this 'Trustless' system is that you have to be more vigilant than ever, because , as it stands, there isn't any place i know of that gets that money back for you.
Personally if they're not a well reputed service, have not received a good rating by the BBB, i won't give them money.

Well it's more like "we run on tens of thousands of computers, we have an idea on how ads should be, if you want to be white listed, you should comply with our guidelines for ads" 
the money comes from making sure people stay honest, that the ads still meet guidelines and that they run to their expectation. 
it's like say you wanted ads on your site, you can create your own ad server, and that'd work, or you can pull ads from other links (so if i had an ad on my server, i give you the link to the file and it loads) however say you don't like annoying flash stuff with music and obtrusive crap, and one day i want my pretty animation to be more flamboyant and loud, and maybe it plays videos or audio that you cant shut off etc., etc., so you could trust me, or check it your self... imagine that for thousands of thousands of apps...

I think until someone can design some massive change to the bitcoin code and create a new coin (or make a new system from scratch), this will always be the case. i like the alt-coins, but they weren't first, so they don't take the brunt of everything like you said. this will be true for any Altcoin. The only issue they'll have is getting them to be taken. thats really it.
With regards to your statment on mining doge in 2015, is it really that small, maybe they think the value will increase enough by then to be still worth it

Will there be an XT based subreddit for when the fork is active, for all those who do think the fork is such a good idea and want to support it?  
And would i be correct in assuming it won't be run by you mods, or at least not by those who are against the fork? 
How will the fork affect Bitcoin? Will existing companies take XT or are those who want XT to succeed have to convince companies to take XT? and would the confusion of having two similarly named coins be an issue for bitcoin (either) acceptance? 
Also for someone who's not been here often enough, whats BAD about the 8M jump? and what's good about it? is there a consensus for a size increase that isn't 8M?

Now i don't know about Germany's thing, but this is stating that the only reason they're caving in is because how unfeasible it is to do. Because they're not the broker, people are. You think people are going to go through a licencing process that's expensive to sell $10 bucks of bitcoin? Hell no...
I don't think it much as censorship if you're doing something to protect yourself, and/or your users. 
i think if NY had even a nice licence for users, something small that kept the regulation, but acknowledged that this is for people they'd be more likely to be used.

Your plan is for the Buisness Owner
You forget how the business owners make money... Citizens. Internet is expensive there, and mobile smart phones are too. so you'd have to do something SMS based, and thats a bit more work than cash or other goods... 
how will you train the citizens to work with bitcoin? they'd much rather use cash, it's significantly faster for them, and even trading for food is faster because some, especially once you get to the islands actually make the things they sell (vegetables, milk, cheese, etc., etc.,) 
if you're servicing a few people it's fine, but more of greece, it's hard to have that many people to handle support and shit and that's not going to be cheap...

So like the way that mining is set up is that theres a competition between large pool miners to solve the next block. People will work with these miners. Some get payed if the block is solve, others are paid per share ( i think most are pay per share of work done)

This is really impressive! I'm just curious since it's off the network, even though theres a lot of entropy there, whats the chance of creating an address that exists? I mean with the network theres possible collision detection - so if you happen to create the same address (even if it's possible to generate a similar address without the private key *i'm not too up to date with bitcoins crypto end* [Although if private keys are related to public keys directly, like you can't create that address without that public key, then i know the chances of a collision are impossible])

Basicially, the network is a chain of blocks - What's in these Blocks? Transactions! Currently - these blocks are a fixed size, and transactions can vary in size. Meaning a block can only do so many transactions before it's full and has to wait for the next one. 
As bitcoin became more popular, there was this congestion on the network. basically transactions went from waiting from 0 blocks to waiting a while... I don't have numbers, because this is a completely network dependent thing. Sometimes it's faster than other times. 
So before i go on, it's important to understand the importance of miners, Miners are people that run Mining Software.  While it's not very easy to ELI5 with Mining. Miners take in a lot of data because they have to validate these blocks among other things. They don't do this for free though. there's rewards for finding new blocks and then transactional miners fees. 
Anyway. So one might say "Well if the bottleneck in transactions is the block size, make em bigger!" Well unfortunately this isn't as simple as changing a number in some code somewhere. there's a lot of politics involved but the biggest issue is that doing this will cause a Fork in the software and chains used.  Depending on the type of fork used (hard or soft) there are different outcomes. 
You may also find yourself asking "How the hell does anyone vote for anything in a decentralized economy" 
Right now the biggest ways are Miner and User activated. Miner Activated things are voted on by the miners, User Activated are people who are running Bitcoin Nodes. their respective software tells the network that says "Hey this guy votes this way" and then the network sees it and then a process happens to implement it. 
Where the issues come in are politics. Miners want different things or have different restrictions than users. Also Miners do a lot of work - shouldn't they have a say in something that affects them. But why let the miners have all the say when they may not be thinking in a users best interest. and with all this comes a lot of confusion and a lot of emotional posting. If you're interested in any of this -read more about BIP148 and it's alternatives - try to filter the BS too...
If not - do what i do and enjoy the ride, see where it takes you
Hope this helps

Never understood the coins that were for 1 or so purpose like namecoin.
It's a coin that you use for Domain name purchasing, that works in a P2P manner, that is normally traded for currencies you can do other things for. But it's main purpose is domain names. + It's mined together with most big pool mines (Bitminter and BTC Guild i know do it)
Which was why i never understood DevCoin, A coin that you get for writing or creating something, which you could just set up a service or a site that did this with other currencies. 
It's like if i made a currency Called BLTCoin and you can only use it on purchasing sandwiches and the components needed for said sandwiches. It doesn't make sense if i could just do that with a general purpose coin like PPC\LTC\BTC

(Ive used them to customize a number of things on my mint system just cause its still linux and its real easy to work with) I learned more about linux from their than a number of years with mint/ubuntu... if your comfortable with linux go for  Or run it in a vm first .

They're tools are amazing, so i like them from that respect, however their business practices, i don't like the lack of a PL and the forced use of the CC subscription model which IMO is kinda crappy as far as renting software as the only method shows a lack of respect for a 30 year old user base of professionals and such. 


Well i think they could write a program to use the Coinbase subscription system or a custom written system to manage bitcoin payments and integrate it with their auth servers.

It's far easier in some aspects, Getting money to Bitcoin may not be the easiest, but everything else is:
When you set up a wallet, you can receive and send bitcoins! Takes a few minutes (depending on your wallet, more if you use the QT Wallet since you have to download the whole blockchain) 
To set up a paypal you have to have a credit card or bank account, then you have to be at least 18 or over to have a paypal. 
So since i don't have a checking account, and i don't have a credit card, when i need to buy something online, i use my brothers account, pay him back, (which is pretty easy) but if it accepted bitcoins, and i had some, and within a few simple clicks (even less if you use a URI Wallet *that accepts bitcoin:// links*) and i'm done, no going through the bank or my brother, just bitcoin!

While WTFPL is a good licence... If you want that added protection, Zlib is a great licence and is occasionally overlooked... but here: 
The More Permissive (WTFPL\MIT\BSD\PD\ZLIB) are great choices if you really want your software to be FREE, GPL and Apache2 are ok if they fit your need, but if you're not up for looking at legal jargon all day, the Permissive licences i mentioned are serious quick reads. (With Bitcoin and it's altcoin bretheren, and most related software are MIT Licenced)
Personally i go with Zlib, just because, i can read it in a few minutes, i don't need to worry about legal jargon and all that stuff and worry more about coding!
I don't know about apache2, but i know GPL Forces anyone that modifies the code to report it back and it's not very clear about how much of the project has to be used in another project before the GPL licence is forced upon a fork or someone looking to use it in their project... 
Ultimately the choice is up to OP.. but Yeah, just thought i'd throw my 2 cents in there)

Probably cause a lot of women aren't that technically savvy. And theres not that much appeal for it. like What seperates a typical Paypal\CC user from a Bitcoiner, without really embarking too much in to the cryptographic and p2p nature of it. Why would i want Bitcoins, when a credit card or paypal seems to do the same thing.
And i don't think it's just women, i think it's the general consensus, it's the "Why do i need this, when what i have works perfectly fine" 
I think it's cool that i can walk around with my bitcoin wallet, Travel internationally, and have no issue buying something (where as you have to xfer cash to X Currency before it's used) And it's far quicker, and safer than a credit\debit card, and easier (I know how to make and use a bitcoin wallet better than i know how to apply and obtain a credit\debit card). Theres a lot of plus's for it. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:09:34
Bitcoin is scary... and new... 
I won't lie, i still don't *fully* comprehend the whole thing.
People Say Secure your wallet: basically an Online wallet, where another company is your wallet, is good enough to get you started. They are encrypted and secure. I use a site called BlockChain, they hold my wallet, secure it (and can be secured with TWO passwords for extra safety *if your really worried about hackers*... also you get a wallet file in which your wallet is a digital file thats accesed by the Bitcoin client thats downloadable from WeUseCoins or bitcoin.org
2- That concern will be fixed when more people adopt it. also theres a bunch of forums on here which will trade it for items, or as a donation or payment for an extra service (ie reddit gold)
4- I won't lie i think this process could be made easier. Theres a lot of terminology and things that just aren't totally explained to the public, you can ask people, and depending where you go you'll find a helpful answer, or a jerk (This subreddit is amazing though, i've had a lot of my newb questions answered here with no problem)
I've never had enough BTC to be concerned about security, (about a whopping 0.003 from mining), but as far as i know, if you keep your PC secure, and treat bitcoin banking like you would your real banking online, you *should* be fine... but theres a lot of tools and things to make it easy to be protected.

Well not really... considering that to have a successful Debit card system in order to compensate for the issues in the market, you have to develop a system in which you are a company that handles a transaction like debit while maintaining a reputable service so merchants will trust that they'll get their payment... (well in the theoretical system i thought up of while wondering how'd it all work) So while it'd be a good thing, theres the die hards who'd rather not have any 1 firm handle these transactions, and would rather use Casacious\Bitbills\etc., so i mean it depends who you're talking to just cause we use coins, doesn't mean we use coins the same way

To buy, you have two options:
1) Get a Trusted Friend to buy them for you and have him send it to your address (Remember, you can have a ton of addresses, so if you received them on one address, you can send them to another)
2) visit  and find someone willing to buy them and meet up in person. I'd express caution here just as in any time you'd do a person to person transaction with a stranger, thats just me. As far as anonymity goes, you can buy it with cash so it's a bit more anonymous than a wire transfer or something
Also on anonymity: 
Use Tor for transactions (if you're really a stickler for anonymity) or a VPN or something, this way transactions come from an IP thats not your own

Think of bitcoins as digital CASH, as in physical dollars and cents cash (Paper Money). Transactions work just the same on the most basic level of understanding it. its the whole de-centralized nature of it.. CC\Debit has a way of being more controlled because of their centralized nature (CC's especially) where as nobody controls your cash flow or how and where cash will end up.

This is why i think most people don't know of it or don't use it. Theres a lot of things that make this concept of digital money easier to understand, but still theres a lot of things people dont get. 
Maybe its the cryptography? (How can you say this thing is secure when it's open source? What stops hackers from reading the code and knowing how to break my wallet to take my money? Theres less work than a traditional paypal\CC transaction, how can this be financially safe?)
Or how the Blockchain is this crowd-propelled beast? Or more importantly how things work despite the difference between common Fiat transactions? (How can you just "mine" money and then have it go from each person without going through a central service? or being controlled by one person? Where are these "Bitcoins" at? how does it know how much i have? *&lt;- although this ones simple by explaining how ledgers work*)
Or maybe it's the overload of data - People might not care how the hell this thing works, but just care that it works, and the terminology, technology, and infromation are so overwhelming to some that they avoid it completely despite how simple it could really be. 
[Just some common questions i've heard from other people and my initial response to bitcoin before i really looked in to it]


I really love this, the fact that not only can i send money instantly, but say should i take a european vacation, I'm not playing around converting my USD to EUR, but if i had those USD in BTC, It's no problem.

I'd say split your money.
Put X amount of bitcoins in to a secure wallet (I like blockchain, but use what floats your boat) 
Then put the rest in an encrypted wallet, store that some where safe, Preferably one you keep offline, or in a paper wallet...
If you feel generous, put some bitcoins in the bitcointip thing and send some people some money (people like spending and getting money, it feels good). If you want to try to try your hand at the Altcoin market theres that too...
Don't forget Humble Bundle if you're into games, it's where money is split between Developers, Electronic Frontier Foundation and Child's Play, and the Humble Bundle team and you get some nice games in return. and they just recently started to accept bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-06 14:15:19
A few questions: 
* Are there any fees? Either for User or Merchant? 
* Whats the typical transaction fee?
* Is there an additional security thing like requiring a pin to accept the transaction?
* How much will cards and the device cost?
@_date: 2013-06-27 10:42:39
It depends, Right now, i've yet to see a non-forked currency that works as well as Bitcoins and it's altcoin bretheren 
Even if some altcoins become good, i don't see any running out bitcoin. As it is now theres only 1 or 2 GOOD altcoins, with backing by miners and supporters, but i don't see any becoming bigger than bitcoin, but, as they do now, coexist. 


Depending on the the frequency of these updates and how they impact the entire network and economy as a whole could impact (maybe negatively) the value of the currency, i think it's hard stance on keeping a lot of the core statements like block times and the cap. 
Also you have to think, Also Theres not a lot of changes you can do without breaking the entire system. You cant just change the Encryption method, For example, Bitcoin does SHA-256, Litecoin does Scrypt. Some say Scrypt is more secure (I'm no cryptographic expert so i can't say) but it's almost guranteed that Litecoin cant go to SHA-256 or Bitcoin to Scrypt without essentially abandoning the millions of coins found and peoples entire accounts. Which is where altcoins are good at, experimentation of different variables. (Like Litecoin is essentially bitcoin that changes the encryption method, block times and the overall coin cap)

Too bad they'd be a pain to make as far as not being a bulk order... but i'd like to see a 3D Printed coin, that has the Bitcoin logo on one side, and etched in to it is the QR-Code for my wallet
@_date: 2013-09-10 15:31:39
essentially Bitcoin's Value is directly related to 1) Goods &amp; Services 2) Supply and Demand. 
1) The More things you can buy with bitcoin, the more willing people are to accept it and theres more places to spend your bitcoin, So Bitcoins were worthless at first when there was nothing to use them on. but now theres a lot of places that accept it( relatively) and a lot more people that would be willing To accept it in the future
2) Goods and Services is a factor of the Demand aspect of Supply and Demand, And it's why some exchanges want more for bitcoin or some want less for bitcoin. So say if 100 people want bitcoin and you only have 3. How much can you charge? How hard is it to (or at what cost can you) Retrieve more bitcoins. 
IIRC, the Price on Mt.Gox went up when they had less bitcoins available compared to i think coinbase for BTC/USD Transactions. (not sure if this is still the case, but it was a few weeks ago)
TL;DR : Goods and Services Determine Value, Value and Supply Determine Exchange Rates (price)
Best way to get them - If you live in the US, Coinbase seems to be the best, from what i hear its alot easier to send money, also you don't have to worry about wiring money internationally (if you're worried about that sort of stuff)

Heres what i recommend for cold-storage: 
* get a 32GB (or 64) Flash drive (size isn't mathmatically based, but the more you have, the better)
* Install a Linux OS to a flash drive (Fresh installs are virus free, You can go with Ubuntu or Mint as they're easy) (use a CD or a separate flash drive as install media,
* Encrypt your home folder (its an option during install on Ubuntu  &amp; Mint) because your wallet + Blockchain are stored here)
* Boot to the Flash drive after install
* If you go with Ubuntu\mint, remove programs you wont need, *Libreoffice, Musicplayers etc.,* [ i'd leave Firefox on there just cause it's good to have a browser for some reason]
* Install the Bitcoin-Qt program from the bitcoin website
* Run Bitcoinqt, let it download the Blockchain, and configure your wallet encryption.
* Copy the recieve address down, shut down, move that drive some where safe (or IN a safe)
This way you have an Uncompromised OS, it stores the block chain to minimize downloading time, the home folders encrypted so nobody could access it without your password. It's more involved but totally worth it, (especially if you or someone you trust has a safe and you have that much in bitcoins that its worth protecting) 
Tips: [Here's]( some good advice for passwords... also i wouldn't have my login password be my wallet password 
Hope this helps
EDIT: i got a reply from misconception_fixer and so To clarify i recommended linux, because a fresh install is virus free (just like any OS) however Linux is the only one (unless BSD and other Free and Open Source OSs can run the client) of the supported platforms that is relatively easier to work with for a portable scenario (like running that cold storage drive to boot on ANY usb boot capable system) I think windows May be possible, but i recommended linux due to its freedom.
