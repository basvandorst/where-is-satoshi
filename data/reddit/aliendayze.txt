I AM a get rich quick idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:47:42
I did
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:48:54
I feel the same way about this place, but for the polar opposite reason
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:18:47
Actually, no, I'm just a Bitcoin idiot. I want to"HODL" I just don't want BTC going to 0. And I want to cash out now if a lot of people are actually thinking that it's "the end of Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:48:07
Exactly this
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:47:29
Are you hodling?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:40
Hopefully we've seen the worst of it... I think it'll fluctuate until New year's and it'll start growing again afterwards...

I agree that people should cash out eventually into other investments, but Bitcoin is still growing and being implemented and accepted by society. It IS a get rich quick scheme, but you have to be smart about it and know when to leave. I personally don't think it's time yet. *Knock on wood*
And yes, there are billionaire investors but they need to keep their money as bitcoins to gain anything substantial in the long run... Bitcoin has gained mainstream attention only recently...

I got in mid 2017. Lots of worries here.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:37:22
I did use it genuinely. I'm still hodling.
And I'm sure Bitcoin will still be in use, but if Bitcoin is going to be treated like the darknet and only used by criminals and the like... then it is not the future. (And is pretty much the same as being killed off)
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:34:38
You guys are my crystal ball
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:35:22
Exactly. If you really want to compare it with the internet..... The government and corporations want people to think Bitcoin is like the darknet. Not the internet...
I'm sure Bitcoin will still be in use, but if Bitcoin is only used by criminals and the like... then it is not the future. (And is pretty much the same as being killed off)

@_date: 2018-02-06 11:07:28
ok, thanks for the advice?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:26:39
It's not FUD though.
Bitcoin isn't going to get anywhere if the only people that use it regularly are criminals.
It was a good idea... I WISH bitcoin was the future... but the general public is not buying it and huge corporations are trying to kill it... and it's working...
Please prove me wrong.
for the record, I'm still HODLing.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:41:14
I didn't sell but I am worried :/ I just need a hug...
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:20:31
I'm wondering if I should sell now and buy more when it crashes further
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:25:01
I hope you're right.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:41:19
A lot of shit can happen in 1 month that can kill an invention.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:10:31
Should I sell now and buy when it crashes further?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:07:26
That's true. But they only "care" because they want to stifle it in hopes to kill it...
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:35:59
Tell me where I should be asking then?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:24:24
Not if nobody in the world wants to use bitcoin other than criminals.
It was a good idea... I WISH bitcoin was the future... but the general public is not buying it and huge corporations are trying to kill it... and it's working...

@_date: 2018-02-06 11:19:06
Yeah. That's why I'm hodling lol.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:26:18

@_date: 2018-02-06 09:29:03
Wow, so everyone on this forum that's been saying HODL were just trolls? 
I need to evaluate my life...
Thanks everyone on this forum.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
