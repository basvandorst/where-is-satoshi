Couldn't you achieve the same effect by opening a Chrome incognito tab? Most Chrome extensions won't load unless you specified that they should. 
I'm glad to see that the new IE is better. My main complaint, above them all, is that IE doesn't self-update like Chrome. This means that web devs still have to pull their hair out to get their CSS to render in IE6. They could have at least updated the renderer.

You can, but it's not recommended. 
I mean in general. VPNs are a single point of failure as they have to be trusted, and they are much more vulnerable to timing attacks than Tor is. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:49:52
Are there extensions for it besides toolbar spam? Does it actually render pages properly now?

Not on the smartphone, supercomputer, server, and embedded system world. Linux dominates there because of its efficiency, freeness, security, and flexibility. Windows dominates the desktop world because MS spends millions in contracts with PC manufacturers to install Windows. If I could take the average person, erase their knowledge of every OS, and show them a tour of Windows, Mac, and Linux, I'm sure they would not chose Windows. Improved peripheral support would follow if this could be repeated with many, many people.
Likewise, USD, the Euro, etc, dominate because they are already in place, but that doesn't mean that there's no hope for alternatives.

True, it does include things like Flash and various codecs in order to offer more complete multimedia support than Ubuntu out of the box. The Linux purists see this as a bad thing of course, but for the majority of the population this makes Mint seem more feature-full, comfortable  and elegant than Ubuntu for someone coming from Windows.
If you really want to be pure about open-source and security, then Debian is a good choice.

Ah, thank you! Now I finally understand that part when I look at a transaction in a block explorer!

Hello again. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:24:06
Sure, in which case both people won the race and there are now two blocks with perfectly valid magic numbers. Both are accepted into the chain side-by-side, like a fork. Then the race continues to find the next block to attach to either one. When that race is won, that chain is longer than the other, so the other block becomes an orphan and is abandoned. Everyone switches to the new longer chain, all the transactions in the orphan block are recycled, and life goes on.
You don't need clocks to be highly synchronized, since every block contains a timestamp of when it was created.

The top comment was a quote from Linus saying that he would know that he'd won when MS catered to Linux by opening up their stuff. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:18:26
Oniontip.com also takes BTC. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:06:38
Because along with that magic number there's also a request for X Bitcoins to be created into a given address. Everyone can verify that the magic number is the right number for the magic problem, so therefore everyone agrees that X Bitcoins have been minted. The reason that everyone knows any the magic number is that it's shouted/broadcasted out to the Bitcoin nodes, so everyone gets the news within a second or two of it happening.

Trade LTC for BTC on one exchange. Move LTC to another exchange. Trade for BTC. Move to a wallet you control. Use Tor when you do this.

I would recommend Linux Mint for anyone coming to Linux from the Windows world. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 18:53:19

Why is the US blocked? 
@_date: 2014-07-13 03:47:16
You can use Tor and achieve a similar effect, only it's free.

There's are mirrors of torproject.org. If you need one I can link you.

It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:49:54
It's nothing more than a collection of data that links to the previous collection of data. Blocks contain, among other things, the transactions made right before that block was mined.
You can use a block explorer to browse BTC blocks.

@_date: 2014-11-10 15:44:03
I understand the blockchain and the network pretty well, but I don't yet fully understand where the timestamps come from. How does Bitcoin ensure that everyone's clocks are synchronized and that no one is maliciously fabricating timestamps? 
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:03:26
That's not a good idea. The person selling the vanity addresses would then have access to the private key, which is obviously not desirable. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 08:05:33
There's a scene that involves Tor. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 08:29:39
True, but it's better than nothing and still better than VPNs. There's no perfect system. 
In Tor, exit nodes see the requests for website but cannot know where they came from. It's also hard for them to wiretap your exact activities because to Tor Browser includes the HTTPS Everywhere extension, which makes a preference of HTTPS to cleartext HTTP. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:07:13
Yes you can. They can run side by side. Just make sure the port numbers are different. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:22:58

@_date: 2014-09-08 12:05:45
The blockchain data structure. What exactly does it look like? How are the transactions attached to a block, if only the Merkle root is there? How are mining nonces (confirmations) recorded?
I'm doing some research in Bitcoin and I'd love an explanation or a diagram to help me understand.

@_date: 2013-12-11 21:03:31
The person in question was asking detailed questions about how it worked but didn't have a background in the math/crypto so I had to basically explain everything from scratch to make sure I didn't lose them.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:03:42
Thanks! How would you explain it then?
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:40:47
Well I didn't fully understand that part of Bitcoin, hence why that part of the explanation was poor. Can you explain it to me? I'm familiar with crypto and SHA-256.
