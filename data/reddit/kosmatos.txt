No, it isn't.

It doesn't matter what method or currency you are paid with. What matters is how you store that wealth for later reuse. You can convert anything to anything, but how you hold it over time is the critical part you have to get right. Hold it in a currency that is being diluted, your stored wealth goes down. Hold it in tech stocks like $AAPL and $NFLX, different. Bitcoin? Different. Gold? Different. Real Estate? Different. Etc. -- Some of these are more readily converted back later (after you are done holding it) to whatever currency you need in order to use it.

For some transactions, such as large ones (over $25 in some cases), even when using Apple Pay, you need to sign the transaction with your signature using a stylus. The fact that it is the underlying system (either the merchant's choice or the credit card company's) that causes this does not change the ruined Apple Pay experience.

I agree with all of you, but it's just that I would really have liked to spread around a *bitcoin* article that doesn't make a whole lot of people (who have iPhones) just want to give up. I mean, think about it, you're trying to tell people to INVEST $20 in Bitcoin, but then you also tell them to chuck their iPhones as well? That's starting to be too much trouble if you ask me. Just focus on the part where you try to get them to get going with bitcoin. Apple will follow later when enough people are on board. If you want Apple to die, fine, then your priority isn't bitcoin.

Do not make the mistake of thinking the Canadian government is friendly to Bitcoin. Like most nations, we have a Central Bank, and like many nations, our Central Bank knows exactly what is at stake if Bitcoin takes off. The only reason they are not on the offensive at this time is because, says the central bank of Canada, Bitcoin is too still too small.

Technically if the business is using BitPay or any other service that actually converts the Bitcoin to U.S. Dollars before paying the merchant, then they aren't actually receiving bitcoin and therefore this is moot.

It doesn't matter what the price is pegged to. What matters to people holding bitcoin is how much BTC the item will cost at the moment it is purchased. That said, I personally prefer to use bitcoin because I like to pay things with cash, not getting a temporary loan. I like to pay NOW instead of being surprised at the end of the month. I also save my merchant credit card fees which means it is win-win. I don't give credit card companies all the info on me. I don't get calls to ask if I need to authorize a big transaction, or an international one. I don't get my credit limit raised all the time. I don't need to carry the plastic card. Nobody will bother me with stolen credit card info. These off the top of my head...

You are assuming that Bitcoin actually has a market cap of $5B today. That number comes from multiplying 13.5M bitcoins by the average market price on exchanges right now. However, look at the charts of the available buyers / market depth (and multiply by 10 for buyers that don't keep their money on exchanges with buy orders already activated), and you might find the true market cap is 10 times lower. So your $7.2 Trillion market cap is just $720 Billion. Market cap of Apple.

Yes, me.
I ordered a 600 GH/s Monarch in Aug 2013, and got two 700 GH/s delivered as soon as they were shipping, plus a refund of approx half what I paid. They clearly stated when they were taking pre-orders that this product is still in development and that they can't be sure when they will deliver. Anyway, despite being late, I am now mining, and it has already generated about 0.5 BTC for me. My energy cost is ZERO because my house is heated with electric resistive wall heaters and it's already winter.
Note: ROI was never really going to happen anyway, even if they did ship on time. Everybody knew that for a long time now, and it is still the case I believe with all mining hardware you can purchase today. I'm not mining for profit, I'm mining to do my small part to help keep mining decentralized. Also run two full nodes in two countries.

Stop playing with words. Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography.

13 reasons why I use Bitcoin... 
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:08:19
This was all dealt with at the Bitcoin Expo 2014 in Stefan Molyneux's talk. When it comes out on video, I suggest you watch it. When mass action needs to take place, and you have to go to each individual's home and force them to give you money, the costs are high. So much easier to just tell banks to hand over the money (or just have the central bank print more). And if people in families spread out accross the land hold multi-sig keys to their wealth, and the population is using bitcoin to a decent extent, the whole thing becomes too impractical.
Men with guns have power, yes, but they need to be paid or promissed something they believe they will get.

I was in Greece this summer. I talked about Bitcoin here and there. Few people knew what it is, and those who did, considered it dodgy.
Even if citizens were made well aware of what it is over the course of the next couple of years, I wouldn't expect acceptance of Bitcoin as a nationally adopted currency any time soon. They'll have to start using it first, it has to be something a lot of people have experienced and understand.
Maybe in 10 years or more.

If they are too embarassed to display Bitcoin prominently up there with the other options, then I am not going to reward them again this year. I know they don't want to cause customer confusion, but if they aren't on board properly, then I'm not going to help them until they are.

It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor now. There will be a massive transfer of wealth in the coming years. The wealth will transfer from those who resist cryptocurrency to those that embrace it. The earlier you embrace it and take whatever (even if small) savings you have, and move it to cryptocurrency, the more you will be riding the tidal wave while others are drowning from it. Much teeth grinding. Which group will you be in? Rich or poor now, your choice, and the expediency of it, will determine if you will be rich or poor later.
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:47:52
That's not an argument against bitcoin. Obviously Milk is priced in the fiat currency of the local area, so its value in any other currency/commodity will fluctuate. That's the property of money called "unit of account", it is a measure used to value/cost goods, services, assets, liabilities, income, expenses; i.e., any economic item. It is one of three well-known functions of money. It lends meaning to profits, losses, liability, or assets.
If it becomes more popular to price something in Bitcoin, it would be the opposite, and look something like this to a Bitcoin user: 
I'd like some milk please. That will be 2.85 mBTC. Sure here you go. 
And like this to a $USD holder that never uses bitcoin:
I'd like some milk please. That will be 2.85 mBTC. Hmm... How much is that in $USD? $342.55 at current exchange rate. Sure here you go.

Actually, the most important thing is to hold it. To store your wealth in it. That is what gives a commodity value, not "the last mile", the trade at the end to exchange it for something else. When that happens, the "something else" (goods, stocks, *fiat currency*) gains value and bitcoin loses. If most people's wealth was stored in Bitcoin, government's shenanigans to devalue their currency to fund projects (like... war) wouldn't work.

I like what core is doing. However, I don't mind if the majority of the Bitcoin community (miners and node operators) wants to hard fork to increase block size. Which is why I will run classic nodes (which are just core + 2MB for the moment) until the congestion issue is solved. The difference between my nodes and regular core nodes is this: if there's concensus to hard fork to 2MB blocks, my nodes will accept it and play along. Once it happens, core adds the 2mb max size code to their code (otherwise their branch dies into obscurity) and we all switch back to core nodes. The fear of a hard fork for 2mb blocks will have passed, and the team can continue their excellent work. Personally, running Classic nodes to me is not a vote to change the dev team, just a vote to say I don't mind doing a hard fork update for 2MB, if Core doesn't do it in time anyway. If this doesn't make sense, let me know.

Thanks for the suggestion. I'll give it a shot.

Instead of using Western Union to send money from Canada (or anywhere else, it doesn't matter) to Greece, I can do the following:
1) Buy Bitcoin in Canada (or use my reserves)
2) Find a localbitcoin user (buyer) in Greece that wants Bitcoin and will trade Euros for it
3) Have them deposit money in the destination Greek bank account where Western Union would have put it
4) Done
Hope that makes sense.

This exact same question worked for me: 
@_date: 2016-11-29 07:45:42
Level 1 answer: Gold has a nominal value for its practical uses (for example as a conductor in electronics) but most of its value is speculative based on its properties as money. (The usual ones like scarcity, divisibility, fungibility, longevity, etc.)
Level 2 answer: Everything has a value equal to whatever a person that desires or needs it is willing to pay at any given moment in a given context. Gold has no value, specifically to answer the question, no intrinsic value whatsoever, except that assigned to it by a person, in a given context. Example: It would have no value on a planet with seas of gold bars, nor would it have value to a man dying of thirst in a desert that would trade his caravan full of gold bars to a passerby for 1/2 bottle of tap water. 
Level 3 answer: The same as level 2, but replace person by entity such as human, software AI, business, or any other entity.

Well, actually, I mine, and keep my equipment up-to-date, simply as a way to contribute to keeping Bitcoin decentralized. I don't get back my investment in terms of BTC, but I also get to vote with my hash power. I can decide to mine or not mine large blocks for example, versus just yapping about it in forums. I think of it generally as "protecting my bitcoins", like someone paying Vaultoro to hold their gold for them.
@_date: 2015-08-21 04:05:57
I don't think so. Every 12 days or so, the difficulty adjusts, and the blocks go back to being one every 10 minutes. With a steadily increasing hash rate, it does make blocks go faster (in between the adjustments) but not by 2-3 months?!
@_date: 2015-08-29 15:14:32
Yes they are. Read the instructions about the default withdrawal address.

What about their Vault service? (Didn't try it)
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:13:41
Don't forget that if many miners abandon Bitcoin Core, it could take a very long time for enough new blocks to be mined until the system recalculates the difficulty. Which means confirmation times could be 40 minutes, 100 minutes, hours, for months, or worse. Bitcoin isn't great at handling hash power decreases. Catastrophe for Bitcoin Core.

Wait. You haven't used this computer in a long time. The swap file, or some other files in that computer could still contain the password or private keys. Back up every file, then start examining everything for clues. In one case there was an unencrypted version of the wallet available before it was encrypted, and the private keys were still there.

Meanwhile, I spun up a full node on a powerful VPS system, but that is not the ultimate in decentralization, as I'm sure others are also on that provider.
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:04:45
For me, it did need to be a core function. It was precisely the reason why I took down my node. I have 500GB/m bandwidth and it was using 750GB+/m. The fees were quite high. It was on a Mac Mini dedicated to running the full node. My firewall/router has no options to limit bandwidth, and so I used a bunch of unix networking tweaks to try to get OS X to limit the bandwidth, and it failed. So I gave up, I have other things to do. If it was an option, I know a few people who would use it.

Joking aside, here's how it could work: Instead of shredding the bill, the bill comes out the other side after being scanned. The app communicates the serial number to a bitcoin exchange, where a seller of bitcoin now becomes the owner of that bill. The user's bitcoin wallet receives the bitcoin for it. The user must keep this bill, because the serial number will prove they still have it in order to prevent fractional reserve banking scams, until such later date that the app instructs them to either give it to someone else nearby, or to take it back themselves if they are willing to buy it back at current market prices. Throw in some bitcoin multi-sig reserve bitcoins to make sure the user will indeed pay back the billl... and... ah screw it

@_date: 2015-09-21 18:52:38
You may not understand Bitcoin's unique selling point. If they use their own systems, they are asking for trust to be bestowed uniquely onto them. This is the same as usual. Try to understand, for example, why Apple has started encrypting everything for the user and gets none of the data back onto their cloud. The reason for this is that they can no longer be manipulated by government agencies nor hackers or criminals. They just aren't in control, and therefore are not responsible, and cannot be manipulated. Same with the banks. It is more profitable the old way, but the new way will win out as the old way proves to work less and less, as state(s) tightens the nooses.
@_date: 2015-09-17 15:44:49
Personally I don't care what the state thinks of Bitcoin and whether or not it recognizes it as a currency. However, to be able to pay my taxes in Bitcoin is desirable. It makes it easier for me, since I don't have to involve a third party to convert BTC to fiat. (Not having a state at all, and not having to pay any taxes at all is more desirable, but that's outside the scope here)

I was there last summer and a few people had heard of it. However, they did not understand what it was for or what good it could do for them. The Greek finance minister, however, is very familiar with it and has written about it and has talked on podcasts like Bitcoins And Gravy. You won't hear him talking about it on national media though. He doesn't believe a modern industrial nation can use it. Or at least he won't say so publicly, yet.
*EDIT* Okay, so the Bitcoins And Gravy was made up by the podcaster, I actually didn't realize it, but I did hear him in a talk with Antonopoulos on another podcast, and he has written about it. 'nuff said.

I have ordered from them, never received anything, but am quite confident I will. If you are frustrated that the orders are taking TOO LONG to be sent, fine, but to ask to take them down (whatever that means) is just wrong.
