I once spent .10655 BTC on Steam...aka $1433.48 in today's dollars :( ...Do you think I can still apply for a refund?..xD

Buying a house is exactly the first thing I would do as soon as and if my crypto portfolio ever reaches that sort of amount. Outright owning my own house with no mortgage before the age of 30 is a HUGE deal!

PHEW! I just recently withdrew some payouts! If I did lose anything, I lost maybe $20

For the past 2 years I've been telling my friends and family to invest in Bitcoin and NO ONE has taken my advice still! My impression from them is that most are just really scared about taking the risk in something they don't completely understand..which is..well..understandable

Threw $1.2k in at $6,300 :( ... didn't think it would keep dropping this deep into the 5,000s ... I always wait too long on these dips or it shoots back up when I'm asleep! And now of course I didn't wait long enough!

I recently started mining too! I have a 1080ti mining at 38-39 mh/s, a 1070 at 31 mh/s, and a 1050ti and 970 both at 13 mh/s (Avoid the 970 btw, it should have a much higher hash rate, but has so many problems with mining for some reason...the 1050ti is more efficient). I've been mining ethereum and I plan to convert it to bitcoin

LOL I do this to myself everyday..I look back at the all-time charts and say  "Wow if I only invested my whole savings account on this day, I WOULD'VE HAD MILLIONS!"

I didn't buy as low as I could've..didn't think it would dip that far into the 5000's like it did..but nonetheless I did buy in and I'm sooo ready for $10k :)

I doubt it's going to take a year to hit 15k-16k..but either way, I'm in it for the long haul. I'm not making the same mistakes as I did in 2017..Buying and HODLING!
