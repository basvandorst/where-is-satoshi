What, lol?
It may not be a fix for Greece but it can be a fix for Greeks who want an alternative to the insanity of their current financial system.

If you have a pulse and live in the US you can get in trouble.

Definitely bad, but there are [more fungible currencies]( If bitcoin doesn't get its shit together on privacy you have other options. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 05:20:50
That sounds like a terrible idea.

Dash has half the full nodes of bitcoin with a tiny fraction of the market cap because of the master node system. The significant investment in dash required to run a masternode makes a consensus attack infeasible.

Dash has set aside 10 percent of the block rewards for development and the maternodes vote on where the funds go. We even call it [decentralized governance](
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:52:18
Don't tell me how to feel. Also it's the government defaulting not the economy.

Removing the shit wont make the house livable. Got to tear it down and rebuild at that point.

I accidentally sent a transaction with no fee one time and it took like a week to confirm. That was before the recent transaction spam though so your results may vary.

I wonder what they think of the block size compromise. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:31:12
Right, I would love to save 25% on some socks through police harassment. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:40:57
The bitcoin blockchain wont be able to handle it for at least a decade under the new blocksize cap rules.

He drew a line on a chart. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:47:17
well what a clusterfuck, time to diversify into alts i guess
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:11:17
It's happening. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:24:21
Except, you know, the mailing address. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:38:26
You hope.
@_date: 2015-07-24 03:57:55
With the block size compromise they wont be able to do much with it for a decade.

I thought the lawyers were going to get all the money.

We are one piece of good pr or a viral meme away from a million more users.

An interesting anecdote is that 3 years ago the most popular alternative currency at [porcfest]( was silver and this year silver was nowhere to be seen and everyone was using cryptocurrencies. 
People actually using alt-currencies prefer crypto and not "its kind of better than metals" its more like "fuck metals give me crypto."

Because it would require consensus and it is in everyones best interest that currently have bitcoins that the cap not be changed. I think it is in the realm of possibility that the community could be persuaded to not halve the reward at some point when the inflation rate is low single digits but it seems highly unlikely. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:01:11
I was thinking about the 8mb doubling every 2 years thing. That is still looking like what is going to happen right?
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:20:56
I thought there was a significant delay after 750/1000. Like months. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:21:02
Better to have it younger when you have a better chance of surviving. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:46:31
It will hurt if we cant raise the blocksize faster than adoption.
