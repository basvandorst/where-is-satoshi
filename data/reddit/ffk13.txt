I don't think Smithers has ever said "Okily dokily" before, and Mr. Burns says Excellent not Fantastic.

I use QuadrigaCX.  It has been working pretty well for me.

I guess that could work, hopefully though this is all automated, because if it is overly complicated to do, I don't think people will bother.

It will probably be processed pretty soon since sub 300 sat/byte transactions have started to confirm.  You can check approximately where it is at here:

True but since it is open source, many eyes are there to spot vulnerabilities, or malicious intentions by the core developers.

I messed up that last pump, traded half my btc for bch at around 1700, a couple hours later (shortly after it soared to ~2700) it was 1400.  I cut my losses when it went to about 1200.  I'm still new to crypto, so that was a rookie mistake.  Luckily I don't much $ in yet, so I didn't loose that much, but lesson learned.

I used shapeshift to exchange btc -&gt; bch.  Fees were pretty bad there though it seems.   When I buy with fiat I use QuadrigaCX (Canada).

Difficulty adjusts in about a day, and looks to drop 8% or so, this should bring block times back to normal hopefully.

I'm probably wrong, but dont miners require a full node in order to mine blocks?  If that is correct, then at the very least mining pools would still be running full nodes.

Isn't something like 97% of xrp held by the devs?

My watch is still on standard time.  I'm protesting the system! (Actually I'm just lazy, but daylight savings sucks)

Is shakepay on BMO's block list for interac e-transfer?
Edit:. Just tried it and it worked!  I found my new funding source.

These are unbelievably bad ideas.
