Hate to break it to you, but no one here matters to Mt. Gox.  They don't care what you believe.  Until it suits them to release more information, they won't do so.

I know PayPal is equivalent to the devil here, but OP's title makes it sound like these fees are new.  They aren't.  He leaves out a few things:
* These fees are not new.  They've been taking out these fees on personal payments for a while now
* These fees only apply if you use a credit/debit card to send.  The card companies take out a pretty large fee, so Paypal passes that onto you
* Fees are a lot lower if you send money using Paypal balance (free within the US)
* These fees apply for personal payments (sending money to friends or family), not purchase payments (merchants)
* The only big change here is that before, the sender got to choose if the recipient paid the fee.  Now the sender has to pay the fee
Source:  I've made half a hundred Paypal personal payments in the past year

If it was an unauthorized charge to your credit card, why not call up your credit card company and initiate a chargeback?

How is there such a big difference between Mt. Gox and other exchanges?  Wouldn't people buy from the lowest exchange, transfer the coins to Gox, and sell them at the higher price?

The link he posts is discussing customizing doclib filtering using a work-around (hack), not a vulnerability.
If you're going to claim that a government site is compromised, at least back it up with something not completely irrelevant.
