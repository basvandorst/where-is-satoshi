Hype cycle all over again

Yup, but you require miners.
Once all blocks are done, the 2140 estimate is based on assumed halving events and discounts the impact quantum computing could have on solve rate.
Also to note, at the moment there's incentive for non-fee transactions to be mined, that incentive shrinks over time so fees become more important. The pay-to-play threshold will rise, and you'll end up just having an elite system again...

Thanks for the upvote! Regarding comment I was responding to, it appeared to me that his implied question was "Why does everyone use this if it isn't private?"

had a question about anonymity.... I answered it and are now being punished? Did I miss something?

This doesn't guaranteed anonymity.
e.g. When you first create a reddit account, it's entirely anonymous, as you use your account, you inevitably give away some clues about who you are via your comments, submissions, etc.
Same thing for BTC, they'll find you if you're not careful, and even if you're particularly careful, they might still find you through association.
