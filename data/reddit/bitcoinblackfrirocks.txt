Terrible.  Why would someone set up a datacenter with outrageous electricity costs?

Altcoins may eventually fill this need if bitcoin becomes too expensive to use for microtransactions (which it arguably is now).  Litecoin is much cheaper to send right now.

I track all my cryptocoin valie in Mint by listing it as Gold in the assets area.

Actually, yes, I shave with a straight razor.  You're at the top of my list next time I need supplies.  Thanks!

The patent should be "a secure method of sharing your private credit card details with random merchants for no reason when more secure solutions already exist"

Just bought some cast-iron serving skillets with wooden trays!  YEEEAHHHH!!

Another person Paul Krugman says doesn't understand humor!  "Bitcoin is evil" is apparently some sort of stupid joke that only Keynesian economists understand.

More like "I left my 98 Windows open in my house and they came in when I was at work and stole my wallet."

Thanks - now when people say it's too expensive we have something to retort with: "it's only $1!  What are you, a cheapskate?"

Nope it was mostly really smooth.  There were a couple hiccups, but they're sorted.

I decided to donate and let archive.org know why:

Will it be possible to use your product without being a willing party to money laundering activities, and therefore potentially subject to prosecution with the blockchain as a witness?  If I mix my transaction with one from one of these people, how will I defend myself in court for assisting them?:
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:01:22
Ha awesome - I hope it's good!

I have an entire post on this here:

That is NOT high quality.  Use a flatbed scanner with an extremely high resolution - find a friend that has one if you have to - and post it here.

In the near future, provided things go to plan, the release of massive amounts of Cointerra and KNC hardware will probably fix this issue.

Thank you!  I am building a rather massive collection at the moment.  Those were all purchased as a snapCard shopping cart and I did a custom transaction in blockchain wallet to output coins to every payment address with a single transaction.  Only cost $0.11 to pay for 6 eBay buy-it-nows.

Really, I would have donated bitcoins IF I HAD THE OPTION.  Why is wikipedia so averse to accepting them?
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:50:04
You're welcome!  Thanks for giving us bitcoin users the power to buy ANYTHING with bitcoin.  Your service has made it very easy for me to use my coins.  I'll be looking forward to your post!
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:00:06
So we're going to make mirroring the blockchain illegal - great.  Nice idea.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:14:53
Thanks that's what I thought.  I just hope you or your users don't end up in prison due to this.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:42:07
How do I order in bitcoin?!?!  It keeps asking for all these weird things like "CC Number" and "Expiration Date" - wtf is that?
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:49:26
As a saver who spent over $2000 in BTC today on Black Friday deals, I have to say that these attacks on "deflationary" currency are unwarranted.  If I want to continue to speculate, I can just buy more with fiat.  As long as fiat currency exists, deflationary currency will win.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:42:02
Thank you - I may buy from you next!
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:49:00
I find this kind of hilarious, actually.  Goes to show if you want to do illegal things with bitcoin, you might get illegal things done to you or your money.

Black friday Gyft was offering 4% cashback - the most I get from using Visa at Amazon is 3%.  Exchange fees are rather minimal - I buy very large blocks of coins at a time, and I pay around 0.6%.  Transaction fees are really minimal - $0.10 I can deal with - and that will be decreasing soon because of client changes (some clients won't relay transactions without a large enough fee).  A tenth of the time?  How?  In one case you have to constantly type your credit card number by hand into forms.  In bitcoins case, you just copy/paste and hit go.
Missed opportunities from speculating on BTC exchange rate is a bit sad, but just wait for a dip and re-buy, and you probably just saved 10% over holding the coins.  A dip will come eventually, just wait.

Why is this being downvoted?  Does no one care that they'll potentially be subject to prosecution?  Seems rather important to me.  I guess we're all too busy circlejerking it.
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:24:09
This.  I'm so tired of this being an argument against bitcoin - that it appreciates too fast to spend.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:30:32
Right - it would require a legal definition of money laundering that includes unwitting assistance, but ignorance isn't a great defense in court.  It'd probably be explained by expert witnesses like walking up to 2 strangers in an alley and passing hundred dollar bills around at random.  They'd probably ask if you knew that your transactions were being mixed with transactions of strangers, which is one of the main features of your product and is advertised a lot.  Why would one not be able to turn off this feature and just send coins somewhere?  Does libbitcoin no longer support this?
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:41:02
Marscoin - it's on the forums.  Pegged to bitcoin.  Problem solved.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:27:47
Those of us capable of doing BIP0038 properly with paper and electronic backups won't, but it would be an improvement for those keeping hundreds of thousands of bitcoins on coinbase and blockchain.

Monarchy will never fall to Democracy.  Being ordained by God isn't a bug, it's a feature.  Monarchy has been through centuries of innovation.
Sounds pretty silly, doesn't it?
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:01:02
I'll do that next time - thanks.
