Stop taking it personal. It's business.

A few excerpts from the paper:
- The Markus bot: Markus Bot began “buying” bitcoin on 2013-02-14 and was active until 2013-09-27. His account was fraudulently credited with claimed bitcoins that almost certainly were not backed by real coins.
-The Willy Bot: ... a collection of 49 separate accounts that
147 each rapidly bought exactly 2.5 million USD in sequential order and never sold the acquired bitcoin.Willy likely did not pay for the 153 bitcoins.
-Together, the bots acquired around 600,000 bitcoins by November 2013.
-..stave off collapse of the exchange, as long as users who sold bitcoin had enough confidence to leave the bulk of their fiat balance at Mt. Gox. ...If consumers wanted to take out bitcoins, Mt. Gox would immediately have to supply them. On the other hand, if consumers wanted to redeem the fiat cash in their accounts, Mt. Gox could delay the withdrawal by saying that their bank was placing limits on how much fiat cash Mt. Gox could withdraw in a particular period.
-The suspicious trading activity of two actors were associated with a daily 4% rise in the price, which in the
380 case of the second actor combined to result in a massive spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate from around
381 $150 to over $1 000 in late 2013.
-... price manipulation remains quite feasible today.

It doesn't matter what anyone says. If people keep transacting, the price will keep rising. Forget fees, forget decentralization or any sort of ideological jargon behind bitcoin. The fees are this high because people are willing to pay for them.

Funny, when will people admit that Bitcoin is probably crashing and can crash. I'm still waiting for Bitcoin to drop below 5k and read posts saying it isn't a crash.

In other words, if you're paying high fees, you're basically feeding the market manipulated by someone to get those fees in the first place (and getting fucked over in the process).

Government news regarding North Korea benefitting from bitcoin price increase. 
Mainstream media reporting that the US government confirms North Korea as the sole responsible for the global ransomware attack that requested bitcoin. 
Possible pre-emptive attack on north Korea following a rejected request for talks with the US (that happened today) even without pre-conditions. 
and obviously.. 
Over 205K unconfirmed transactions and rising.
