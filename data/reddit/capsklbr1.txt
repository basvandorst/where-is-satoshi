I have about 3 grand left in savings which I'll probably convert into Bitcoin soon enough..
@_date: 2014-12-31 04:13:08
How much time have you put into researching Bitcoin? In like an hour amount can you give an estimate?
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:55:48
Yeah that's pretty much what I thought. I'll still take that over the fed pumping money out like a bad case of the squirts.

Keep wiki alive!

Sorry who are they ?
@_date: 2014-12-26 04:30:05
Thank you. In what other instances could a transaction not go through? One is obviously you may have not had enough to pay fee, but that one wouldn't even show up in the receiving wallet right.. So how else would it be possible for a transaction to be rejected/returned?
@_date: 2014-12-31 17:37:14
Do you still buy?
@_date: 2014-12-28 05:54:14
hey guys just uploaded all my music check it out and free downloads!  ..gotta cp it otherwise just goes to someone's profile on reddit!
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:00:40
So what if you sent 2 identical payments from 2 different apps of the same wallet and they went to 2 different nodes, they would both be seen in the receiving wallets, but only be rejected once the info from both nodes reached one common node that viewed the duplicate spend and relayed it back to the beginning? 
Is there a way of knowing how many nodes exist in total, and which nodes a transaction gets sent to and how long does it take before all nodes receive one particular transaction? What is a block compared to nodes?

I was just guessing because religious literature is known for its uncanny accuracy... Not
@_date: 2014-12-23 15:08:08
are you saying Bitcoin price would collapse with the dollar?
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:37:45
Cool thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-31 20:21:11
Yes when you centralize control of a currency people will inevitably steal it that is why you keep your Bitcoin or Altcoins in private wallets
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:26:22
Sorry where do you see that? Looks like it's been going down for the past 12 months.

Pump? As in you think this person is being inauthentic and plans on selling as soon as he sees some quick profits? You don't know Bitcoin my friend. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:41:53
Serious answer, 
Bitcoin is the first invention that has the capability of freeing humanity from the throes of tyrannical world governments that manipulate economies via complete control of the money supply. If money is decentralized and no one can just print more money for themselves then we can create a true democracy.

Theoretically can miners permanently block transactions from  moving from these addresses?
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:05:29
It's inflating now but ultimately will become deflationary in the long run
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:45:59
Yes, this would be the "51%" scenario. This question is yet to be answered. What power does this mining pool have that can be used to sabotage the network?
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:55:39
Bitcoin gives us the opportunity to get a hell of a lot closer than the current system, at least. Gotta toss some romance in your ideologies..
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:01:13
I wouldn't say more than Wall Street. why harp on the negative when the positive if so overwhelmingly beautiful? Wait a minute, your name is Bitcoin hitler? lol of course you're a simpleton troll..
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:45:03
so essentially the issue is if they update core code to include gigablocks there will be a brief period of being able to duplicate your bitcoins? why is this so? do gigablocks start with a new ledger history or what?
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:24:31
this is gonna be worth millions one day. F the haters!
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:35:17
Where did you buy your coins ?
@_date: 2015-01-20 08:55:14
How many 10 minutes are in a day though.. 1440.. Multiply by .02%. That's 28%?
@_date: 2015-01-10 07:02:00
Oh I get it, this comment is brilliantly hilarious because stolen coins get dumped on btc-e !
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:02:11
Hi :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:49:08
If you have Bitcoin on an exchange then it's not your Bitcoin. Period.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:54:13
wait am I misunderstanding something or is a republican from texas sponsoring legislation to BLOCK bitcoin regulation??
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:15:56
Am I wrong ?
@_date: 2015-01-20 08:57:49
Ok what about the mining power.. If "bad actors" have too much can they just create their own chains or something 
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:15:40
I see, so what if transactions or "txs" get into old blocks because some miner didn't update the software soon enough, are their bitcoins lost?
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:32:57
Pretty funny although wouldn't be too surprising if this were real.
@_date: 2015-01-09 03:59:29


What kind of event would that be? I wouldn't call it faked, it's just not what some people would hope it to be, but that's ok because the system is still in its early stages. I think it could easily become what people wish it to be and more. The word "free" regarding transactions is pretty loosely used to describe transactions costing pennies to execute. To most people, that's practically free, especially compared with credit card fees. Transactions are pretty much instant, but there is a big emphasis on waiting for them to be verified on the blockchain, which I suspect will fade when mainstream adoption becomes more widespread. The same way people accept dollars without examining whether they are real or not, confirmations for transactions will be more "under the hood" in wallet apps. Bitcoin has it's problems for sure but I'm confident it will overcome them and be recognized for the solution to global economics that it is.  :)

sweetness! check out my beats yo! 
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:40:27
They're well known for poor fact checking 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:30:33
Replace free with fair. It works better and that's what is meant.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:03:24
So true, thank god our government cracks down on all the criminality on Wall Street and beyond. Oh wait... 
@_date: 2015-01-31 01:50:43
Printing money gives the dollar less value, not more 
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:57:49
What regular people? Regular people can't afford the equipment that makes them profit, unless people mine just out of support, but that hash power is minuscule compared to the big dogs. Correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:27:21
Yes, that's exactly what you do when something continuously fails. Good thing Bitcoin came along as everyone's life raft 
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:08:24
thanks !
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:31:13
^This.. remember Zeitgeist 3 when everyone throws their cash at the fed... instead we can now invest in bitcoin! I started getting into it after Andreas was on Rogan the 3rd time.. charm indeed. Bought 6 and not looking back!

this game is fun as shit, I stay getting 1k+ for every turn.

I never said I can't afford it, I'm not dumping my life savings but I am buying on a weekly basis
