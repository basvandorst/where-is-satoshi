How is the exact opposite of it a "product" of it?

Democracy is when people cant agree so instead decide to beat up the minority, while telling them that its their fault for being outnumbered.

Thats even dumber than ethereum.

Between the two of us, im not the one covered in shitcoin and carbon craze.

No, omg, no it is absolutely not a "good concept". Eth is a parody of design, and this PoS change is icing on the pie ������.

"blockchain technology" is worthless without bitcoin. 


Non decentralized; might as well be a database


That is worthless. Carbon swaps are an idiotic, antieconomic concept.

Anything which is not a total surprise is at least partially priced in. So long as at least one person is acting with the halvening in mind, its priced it to that extent.
The real question is "to what extent is the halvening priced in" Unfortunately, in complex chaotic contentious systems like a market, that is nearly impossible to measure.
For a fair floor measure: if there were no halvenings coming, the price would be zero, because that would mean infinite supply.

Are there any other kind?

The article doesnt have enough information to tell what really happened, or if their analysis is even accurate.
If the final destination for the ponzi funds was accidentally linked directly to one of the original theft-linked wallets, they would not have to follow the trail of the mixers.
Its also possible because of the large amounts that chanalsis is making a blind guess based on the raw amounts alone. 180K is a fairly large amount to be moving around.

Yes; its like a pyramid of stupid. Applying a fake technology to a non problem.
Next, faith healing tech being added to prayer based surgery ?
Homeopathic holy water as alien repellent ?
Time Travel hats ?
Modular, tiger repelling rocks ?

Its not debt or interest which causes keynes system to suck. The real problem with keynes system is the unfairness. 
Markets dont function as well on a tilted field.
People shilling for inflation are ignoring the fact that inflation is inherently going to favor the people who can create money, and disfavor those who cannot.

I find it best to react to absurd statements by asking for clarification.

People still use Ethereum?
