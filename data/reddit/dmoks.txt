Thanks. Good sub.

I read that the way you did. They know this is the future, and he even admitted it. Why does this guy think it's going to crash? For the most part he's comparing apples and oranges except in 99 there was a finite amount of people investing in make believe companies with no revenue/profit vs. a market 99.9% of the world doesn't even know about yet, or they are waiting to get in (read: institutional money). Sure, a lot of these ICOs are/could be scams but that doesn't mean it's anywhere near the top of a bubble. The current market cap of crypto is $137 billion, well below what it could be due to outside money. I could see it being a top, for now, and thereafter a consolidation period but not a bubble. We have at least another 5 years before any massive bubble as crypto is gaining more credibility, popularity, actual use causes, and widespread adoption.

What's the number?

What's everybody game plan to putting coins back into play after the fork to get the extra split? I left mine on coinbase bc I read something about then supporting bch in January; now I think I fucked myself.

Just told 6 of my brother's friends at his bachelor party. One bought  yesterday. He's instantly up 200/coin so I'm sure he'll say stuff to his buddies back home.

IMO, the price should be higher as the crashes were mainly due to hacks. Security has been drastically upgraded as more parties are involved. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:20:43
So are you selling or buying? it's hard to tell from what you wrote. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:45:48
If you don't think Ether will make a strong fight then you are in for a shocker. Also, Monero is replacing/has replaced btc where privacy transactions are extremely valuable. I see the three dominating the entire market as time progresses.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:53:36
There is a major website that created their own "currency" and it's called Ebay. Ebay has ebay bucks that can't be used anywhere else except for Ebay; there is nothing wrong with this nor is there anything wrong with buying or selling something online. 
The value of a bitcoin compared to any "legal" currency doesn't seem like bitcoin would make much sense on the surface but as the government prints more money it "devalues" that money which could cause hyperinflation - bitcoin won't have this problem as the max amount is set. Also, in countries such as Venezuela or places in Africa, Bitcoin is in fact a more stable currency as it's outside the control of politics.

I think it will rise based off macro events. I could be wrong but I talk with my money and continue to invest. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:52:31
They're all crooked.
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:07:32
I keep emailing Apple asking when they'll take bitcoin lol

Check out the ticker drys. Nice pump and dump. Roll out to a 1 yr window and view the price history.  Last November it went from 5 bucks to 120 in 2 days.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:17:31
What wallet are you using? The more this type of thing gets sorted out the easier it will be for everybody else and thus the easier it is to integrate. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:16:37
If I say it like a creep in a sexy voive what does that make me?
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:02:26
What wallet do you recommend? Tia
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:51:04
Lol I knew people who had 1000s of btc when it first came out. It was play money back then. If anybody could predict the future you could just buy options and make millions a lot easier and quicker.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:32:58
Thanks mate. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:07:00

Lol 3400..15% is nothing. Come join bio tech or shipping stocks where moves are 50% in a week. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:14:55
There is something called options.

Most people don't know what bitcoin is. Out of the ones that do, I don't think they think this way anymore, maybe circa 2013.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:49:51
let's hope
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:24:22
Yeah, I can use other currencies just like bitcoin and the usd. I don't follow your point.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:58:45
It does. Wired 70k to Merrill last year from td and I was trading 30 min later after I got off the phone with them.
Edit:: they were expecting my wire though so that probably helped. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:40:02
This is probably the best answer. Mainstream consumer has a LOT of challenges, mainly credit cards. There are a lot of benefits to credit cards over bitcoin, no fee to consumer, fraud protection, theft protection, etc. so I'm not sure how easy it would be to replace them. I'm also in the US so I'm unsure how people in India/China/Singapore/Africa/South America pay for things. In the US, I carry like 5 dollars on me for cash only places and pay with credit the rest. There is no need to switch to bitcoin right now, even if places accepted it. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:31:36
Do you use a trezor?
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:56:33
Is this wrong. Why did you write lol?
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:24:05
Nailed it. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:15:18
Yes. I will help. Please buy bitcoin then send it to me. I will do the rest 
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:14:09
I completely misread the main post about using an alternative form of payment vs a mandatory payment...yeah, now my post sounds idiotic. Sorry for wasting your time.

Get a couple of kids and see how much time you have. My time is limited to me taking bathroom breaks at home. Fml

My friends buy their drugs with cash. A lot of people buy drugs with cash. The argument that crypto is for drugs/guns is the stupidest one of them all.

Ballsy my man. Congratz on the vision.

Alright, cool. Thanks for the help!

Go buy shipping stocks and come back in 2 weeks. Crypto movements will seem like no movement at all.

Exactly. My goal is to retire; not to spend profusely. If I can buy extravagant things and still retire then that's better lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:16:27
The ledger s for me would cost approx. 97. The Trezor costs 103. The 6 bucks is a non factor so with the price being equal which would be the better buy? Thank you for your help. I appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:49:25
All mainstream media promoted is bitcoin. Relax.

Funny, your own post shows you had only a small savings to put a down payment on a house and it was from 9 months ago. Therefore, you didn't buy one yet. Second, assuming you are not lying, that you made a very large purchase solely from btc, you would have large capital gains tax...I hope you paid your taxes on the sale of any btc in the 1st quarter bc you will be hit with penalties and fees for underpaying your taxes. Wait til you get that 1099 from coinbase and a follow up letter from the irs. Godspeed
