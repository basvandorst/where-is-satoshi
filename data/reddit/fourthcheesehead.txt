If you are confident about that, you should short the currency :)

Miner here. Unfortunately doesn't work out that way. The hardware is expensive enough that even if your electricity is free you need to be mining 40-60% of the time to break even on the hardware price before you are made obsolete by new hardware.
So really what the play would be is to have mining units that you mine on 100% of the time, but then clock them down slightly during peak hours. But that's not nearly as attractive.

Reward tends exponentially towards zero. If you make 33% of your initial investment back in the first 2 years, and then each two years after you make half of what you made the previous two years, you never get your full initial investment back.

Sold half my coins at $17,000, rebought half of those at $13,000. Have regained all original money spent on my initial coins, and now I've got both USD to spare and also btc to spare.
Be careful out there, but also know people like me have support lines at $10,000, $6,0000, $3,000.

Happens every time the price goes up. Don't worry, there will be a huge correction and then it'll all be back to normal

The HK agreement was rejected by the community as the devs had overstepped their bounds and made decisions that were not this to make. The community rejected the HK agreement as much as it rejected the NYA agreement - this is as it should be

Fine for you to say that. If you are one of the companies that threw several full time engineers and several more full time support staff at dealing with the fork, you've spent real money on a fake problem.
My employer estimates they spent $40k in resources on this stuff and we're a small company. Can't imagine what Coinbase or Gemini had to pay to prepare for the fork.

DNMs are actually generally credited by researchers to be saving lives. Drugs sold on DNMs tend to be more pure, more frequently lab tested and verified, and less likely to kill users who were expecting X but got Y. Safety culture is very prominent on the anonymous markets, and the anonymous markets have been much better about securing safety for drug users than any physical market.

Any exchange at the very least has the responsibility for splitting coins and snapshotting user balances for any large fork. They can't just withhold 20% of their client's wealth because distribution would be inconvenient. They don't need to support the coin to do that, and they don't need to distribute immediately, but next time they move the cold wallet balances, they need to at least split the coins. (Hot wallets should be split immediately).
Obviously there's some threshold where you can't anymore (for small / low value splits), but 2x is almost certainly above that threshold.

But it's not one node. It's an entire community.

DNMs are generally credited to save lives. Because sellers have worldwide reputations, because everyone is anonymous, and because of groups like the DNM Avengers, drugs bought on the darknet tend to be more pure and more accurately dosed than drugs bought on the street, by a very wide margin.
The result is many fewer overdoses and deaths, which typically result from being given a spiked/mixed drug (to save the dealer money) or being given a poorly measured dose.

Glad to see that we are increasing awareness.
If segwit2x was as likely to succeed as it's proponents like to tell us, support would be increasing, not decreasing. But the supporters list is shrinking every week.

How much did this cost to set up? Problem with our liquid cooling solutions was that it was cheaper to just buy more electricity instead.

If the person running the full node is not the one that decides the rules, then how can Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin coexist? Only one of them has the most hashrate.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:01:32
I think you underestimate the number of websites, restaurants, codebases, and merchants that would be affected but pay no attention. We live in a bubble but generally speaking only 10% of a userbase for a product or technology is ever active in any sort of community

When did bitcoin core say they wanted a PoW change? I don't think that's very high on their list of priorities.
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:50:14
I don't think it's likely that there will be brand confusion. It's pretty clear that the majority of the ecosystem is calling the new consensus ruleset '2x' and 'segwit2x' and 'sw2x'. And the 2x chain is trading as the minority value on the bitfinex prediction market, at less than 1/3 price of the legacy consensus rules.
As we get closer to the fork date, companies are increasingly withdrawing from the agreement as opposed to joining the agreement. People are increasingly realizing that the 2x hardfork is politically motivated instead of scaling motivated, and that there are many steps which an amicable or desirable hardfork would be taking that 2x is just simply opposing, instead going for the route that's most likely to kill the existing ruleset. That's not decentralization, it's tyranny and that's not what people signed up for.

It's less risky but technically it's a worse strategy than just going all in immediately
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:20:18
It does though suggest that the patch was not tested under sufficiently realistic loads and circumstances. Which may be more of everyone's fault still, but still.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:35:26
There was not strong community support, and this agreement was rejected because of the closed doors nature. Segwit2x was rejected in exactly the same way.

Personally I'd go raise $25mm from the triads. I'd hire about 100 sleeper agents, and they would learn the skills needed to get jobs at all the major exchanges. All focused on cold wallets and opsec in their skillsets.
Then we'd spend 3-5 years with all the agents moving up the ladders of these companies, building out resumes and credibility, and all continuously getting new jobs at other exchanges every 2-3 years. We'd stretch the $25m super far because our agents would be getting most of their salaries from the exchanges. Our bribe money is just a bonus, not their base salary.
Eventually, some of these agents would be hired into key positions to either spend from cold wallets or to insert back doors. We'd wait until we had access to 2-3 of the major exchanges and maybe a dozen of the smaller cold wallets (mining farms, payment processors, hedge funds). Then in one swoop, we'd steal 5 million bitcoin.
$25m in expenses to the triads, $20 billion in payoff. Easy choice if you can find the right mastermind. Easy choice even if the mastermind wants to keep half.
Cold wallets with hundreds of millions of dollars are a terrible idea.

No! In bitcoin, it is the person running the full node that decides what coin is actually bitcoin. If you run a full node that only accepts the original bitcoin rules, it does not matter what Coinbase or the miners decide to do.
In bitcoin, it is the users that have the power, and that is why I like bitcoin so much.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:51:13
Bitfinex has had a lot of instability in the past, including instituting socialized losses. I would consider the counterparty risk here to be significant.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:16:46
I too like to give the people with all the mining power the authority to decide what is bitcoin.

That still requires the legacy nodes to be upgraded to tell the difference. If 2x has more hashrate, we'll see some large percentage of lite clients follow along simply because they aren't being maintained or even aren't following the news

Trezor + multisig is fine for just 30k. But when your trezor is holding $20 million it's not enough anymore.

Segwit2x forces all users in the ecosystem to upgrade, regardless of whether they like segwit2x or not. It is coercive, led by the rich and powerful, and decided without consulting the users.
