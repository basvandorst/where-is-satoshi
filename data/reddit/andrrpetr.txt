Thank you.
I have just downloaded Mycelium on my smartphone, but there is not this option (just "Type in your master seed separated by spaces").

Is it possible to receive a change sum back at **the same 1ABCD address**? 
It's totally new to me and useful information. I have never read about it anywhere.
Thank you a lot.
Is the same 1ABCD address (for change) appointed automatically (in Mycelium) or I have to appoint this address by myself?

The thesis I am  exploring  is the clear proof of "Bitcoin is  excellent, gold is shit".
The chart (BTC in grams of Gold) does not make it clear to everyone in the world,
but the chart (Gold Price Per Gram in Bitcoins) I think would do.

"  divide the key into 3 pieces where you need at least 2 to decrypt and have those spread out (1 at your house in a safe, another at a bank safety deposit box, another with a trusted family member in a safe).  "
Does it mean that with losing at least one piece of 3 you lose all your bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:12:45
Yes. I  created a deterministic wallet .
Not. I do not think  I can recover the whole wallet with one private key.
I just want to recover my funds only from my one address (my one private key)
@_date: 2018-09-29 07:42:03
Where is the link?
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:18:49
I meant other thing.
I  created a deterministic wallet . 
But for some reasons I recovered funds with only one prive key.
I wanna control funds from my one address (one private key) not the all private keys of the whole seed wallet
I do not think  I can recover the whole wallet with one private key. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:18:34
It's perfect that it's automatic.
Each my solo address (and associated private key) has a relatively small amount, so I don't care about security too much.
Thank you  again : )

Thank you a lot!
I will learn more about the bitcoin-tool ! Totally useful.
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:55:27
Thank you.
I am talking about wallet that was created from a seed. So I got some addresses and I got some funds on these adresses.
Next I recover my wallet only from one my private key (not seed) (suppose I have to do so for some reasons).
What will happen with my change sum (what address will be my change address)
@_date: 2018-09-08 02:59:00
Again, you do not understand anything.
This chart would be clearly proving  "Bitcoin is excellent, gold is shit" to enyone in the world.
All THE REST does not do it clearly!

Thank you a lot.
 Everything worked out  : )
@_date: 2018-09-29 17:39:57
it means you will be still afraid of losing the key (seed).
but they say " y*ou will never more be afraid of losing your Seed* "

It's the reverse, BTC in grams of Gold
Of course I undertand how to make the reverse.
But nevertheless I have asked exactly about  the Gold Price Per Gram in Bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:08:12
Thank you a lot.
I will check Mycelium.
About Electrum. As far I know there is not such option as "restore wallet from private key" (there is just the "restore wallet from master key" option)
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:28:19
thank you man
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:06:16
Thank you.
I have found "+"  key icon, but unfortunately, I do not find the "Advanced" option.
I got a new question.
When by Electrum I make the payment (with my solo private key) there will appear a new change address and a new "change" private key.
Where do I have to seek them?
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:55:38
Thank you!
In the book discribing the Electrum wallet there has been said that  it's dangerous when you recover funds from one private key since then you can not get your change address , "You won't be able to recover address  (change address) if you have only the private key for address
Also there has been said that,
" Importing private Bitcoin keys into a wallet can be hazardous. You should only import money using private keys when small sums of money are involved, and never use this method as part of a strategy for managing larger sums of money unless you’re an advanced bitcoiner. The comic at the end of this chapter illustrates why working with raw private Bitcoin keys can be very dangerous. "

You are totally right about Electrum. I had old information (old screen).
I have just done it with my one private key in Electrum. WOW. Thank you again.

When creating a LN channel -- 2 persons create a new "LN" address in the main bitcoin blockchain, right?

Of course I have read it. It does not help actually.
Only on this reason I made this post.

The last paragraph explained a lot.
I am just trying to estimate the reasonableness of building my LN node on my second notebook if I do not maintain it online for all  time (at least in nights).
So I think 2 days for the timelocks will be optimal in my case.
This is not entirely clear
if should I seek a channel that has (or is ready to set?) the 2 day tiimelock in order to open the channel with it (to sign the HTLC )?
(since there are specific sorts of channels with specific timelocks, like Poon-Dryja and CheckSequenceVerify).

With this reddit bot there is an issue:

Thank you alot.
The  initial idea was to  build the most long chain of the 1sat payments .
Unfortunately lntipbot is not good for that (you **canot pay 1 sat** to other person) so the scheme has changed.
So  now we can do it with mobile LN wallets (custodial and non-custodial).
The ability to do so small payments (as just **1 sat**) **FOR FREE** is absolutely great.
Many people do not even know about such option that is already today.
It will demonsrate the power of Bitcoin (the old fashioned fiat system cannot do it).
It is the idea.
So now  you can post your invoice (2sats) here  and I will send you the 2 sats.

About "and" ( . *Bitcoin &amp; Lightning* )
The thing is that Lightning (without the Bitcoin word) is a wrong thing since " Lightning " is still Bitcoin.
But the way you suggest it will seem to newcomers like something another.
Also it will not be actual to pay onchain for everyday purchases  when there is Bitcoin with Lightning. : )
Even for merchants this will be expensive to process.

If newcomers have never heard of Bitcoin and even more about LN, then it will be senseless to mention any thing but Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be enough to start (since from their (newcomer) point of viewe already all merchant accept Bitcoin).

So of couse they still can't pay since they still don't know about LN. 
It is okay. Then see the point 1 above, 


It is a lot better than nothing.

"Custodial" for small LN payments is completely okay.

@_date: 2019-02-27 16:23:02
Thank you a lot for a so expressive explanation.
This part was most helpful to me:
"Lightning can be applied to either (as I now understand, to blockchains and sidechains). Because of this, many blockchains or sidechains can theoretically implement it."
Although, I do not still clearly understand this part below, since everything of it (in my opinion) may also be said about lightning.
"These \[sidechains\] operate (as far as I'm aware), by periodically locking up funds on the mainchain to "deposit" them on the sidechain. Then on the sidechain, those funds can be transferred back and forth ad nauseum between users of the sidechain. This effectively increases transaction throughput dramatically while also sacrificing security by not being recorded directly to the main chain. Like the deposit, there's a mechanism whereby users can "withdraw" funds from the sidechain by unlocking them on the Bitcoin main-chain. "
@_date: 2019-02-16 15:02:08
You are correct here.
I meant are you sure that **all  the LN mobile wallets**  involved in the twitter torch **were  non-custodial** ???
@_date: 2019-02-16 17:49:27

@_date: 2019-02-16 10:25:04
What do you think the twitter torch is completely "non-custodia"l (without using any LN mobile wallets)?
@_date: 2019-02-16 11:31:56
With this reddit bot there is an issue:

I agree with you.
@_date: 2019-02-09 18:37:14
Of course if newcomers wouldn't know about LN they will not pay  using LN !
They just  stay with Bitcoin AD in this case that additionally reinforces the Bitcoin brand which is very well.
This works this way.
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:48:53
But why should we use the "Lightning Network" phrase in signs at all?
To newcomers "LN is maybe unknown, so without a mention of LN we stay with Bitcoin AD that reinforces the Bitcoin brand which is very well.
To bitcoiners from each of both these signs (versions) it is surely understanbdble that there is LN in this merchant.
@_date: 2019-10-06 06:46:32

One address (P2PKH) has a balance, other  address (P2SH) does not.
Either Bitcoin explorers now do not  show P2SH addresses yet?
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:51:57
Thank you for your opinion.


It will not be expensive at all ( to keep the 51% attack sustained for a long long time ). Since if you already do the attack then supporting for a day (0.000007% additionally = $5m/day) is a  scanty sum.
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:51:48
Then it would be a warning for Bitcoin.
They will act without any  warning.
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:22:35


It's pretty possible for them since we talk about the most powerful people on the planet.


Once again this logic does not work if we want to kill Bitcoin (and also this sum is not significant for them).
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:53:47
Maybe this way will be better,
I have bought some Bitcoin --  namely, 850 000 Satoshis for just $30.
I made an upgrade.
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:41:58
If you do not think about a problem then it does not exist.
Good way, moron.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:58:25
I think it is a rhetorical issue. Actually, we can not do anything with it. But if I could affect this process I would prefer to get this bull run started as soon as possible (even if we should sacrifice the price for a short time).
@_date: 2019-01-29 09:30:36
Why? Make it more clear.
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:42:46


It wil not work second time (some adjustments will not help). It is already commonly admitted that today the POW will not work for new projects (since it will be easy to attack).
"To be honest i am a bit surprised that they didn't try it. Yes this is really a big problem, and it is at the moment just about to start. "
I totally agree with you.

Everything can be done by them. It is not impossible for them!


Once again,  this sum is not significant for them (since they have trillions).
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:53:15
Thank you for your reasonable opinion.


As I wrote in another thread,  they can present a bigger block chain a lot later than many think.
For example, 4500 blocks length (it just takes a month ).
The damage will be colossal.
We will not fix it by changing the code.


Once will be enough.


they can explain everything again as always.
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:30:24
I do not agree with him.
He talks about the economic inexpediency of this.
But this logic does not work when you want to kill Bitcoin and not make money on  double spending .

I totally agree with you.
But they must understand that this is a much bigger problem for them than the World War 2.
I say that because if I were them I would do it 100%.
Do not they dare to do it this time? Since there will not be othere chance in history.
As you said, next bull run will be a game changer.
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:27:03
They do not want to  support the btc network since they can not control it on 100% (payment censoring).
Engage the brain.

not three private keys, but one private key.  
And I  generate  P2PKH  and  P2SH  addresses from one public key (one private key).   
One address (P2PKH) has a balance, other  address (P2SH) does not.
Either Bitcoin explorers now do not  show P2SH addresses yet?
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:46:16
Do not you want to start the bull run more soon?
Is it better to wait another 2 years?
Please make it more clear.
@_date: 2019-01-15 05:27:47
Thanks!  
Which 4 address types you mean?  
 P2PKH, P2SH, Bech32

when exactly will this happen, boy
@_date: 2019-02-08 07:07:42
This new implementation brings new great features so the logo has to be saying that it is something new (being the same).  Succession (continuity) is paramount.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:35:24
Unfortunately, most people do not distinguish the BTC/USD pair from the BTC/USDT pair. 
The Bitcoin price in USD is at the current high levels  only due to USDT.
If there will not be Thether, there will not be these prices.
@_date: 2019-05-01 15:59:24
Are you an idiot?
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:26:45


But all these  alternative stable coins can not be  inflated  up endlessly as tether was(is).
There is the strong different.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:46:05
"If you're willing to store one key why not make it the master seed?"
Maybe I do not get what the master seed is.
"So I have just one main seed and many keypairs with coins in many addresses."
Is not my main seed the master seed here?
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:08:03
Yes I do. It does not help a lot.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:58:26
Thank you.
Are you sure that your initial private key from which you get your seed will be a part of the new created tree of keys (created by BIP32)?
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:37:47
" It does. It's BIP32. "
Unfortunately BIP 32 does not help
since my initial private key from which I get my new seed/mnemonic will not be a part of the new created tree of keys (addresses) that I get by BIP32.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:24:57
Not the amount of coins in an address but in the main seed.
Probably you have lost me totally.
Let's start from scratch.
So suppose I have the main seed (mnemonic) and a tree of keypairs creared by BIP39.
So I have just one main seed and many keypairs with coins in many addresses.
And  each period of time I wanna spend coins just from one of the addresses without engaging the main seed.
and without having new additional seeds to store (with having a new address for change each time).
Got it?
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:20:38
" You literally want to generate a tree of keys from an existing keypair? "
Yes I do.
So suppose I have many pairs of the key-address  (with coins on each such address).
I want to get the trees and then to spend coins from each my initial address (with coins) and each time have a new address for change (inside the tree).
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:59:26


LN can provide anonymity only inside the LN system (when you make payments inside the LN system) but not when you create the LN channel. Got the difference?
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:54:33


It is not about what bitcoin is bought with,
it is about what price bitcoin is bought at.


@_date: 2018-12-26 06:47:28
Re-read this carefully.  
 
All I wanna say is
Any anonymity-providing technology is sufficient to win. (As a means of storing value.)
Any scalability-providing technology is not sufficient to win.(As a means of instant and cheap payments.)
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Even before creating a LN channel you can have problems with the government if your Bitcoins are  tainted.
Also a counterparty of your LN channel can have problems  after creating the LN channel if your Bitcoins are  tainted.
Will a billionaire like to use this if his entire bookkeeping is in full view for everyone?
Will   everyone like to receive Bitcoins if it can happen that your Bitcoins   are not equal to other Bitcoins (your Bitcoins are worth nothing, zero)   since you got them from a complicated chain of payments (involving  drug  (or even terror) payments you could not know about)?

our discussion with Mr Gnome.
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:34:47
Then (in this case) I will have to store many new addidtional seeds (mnemonics) for each such new HD wallet.
(since, as we remember, there are  many pairs of the key-address (with coins on each such address).)
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:30:01
Thank you,
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:50:48


It is not about what bitcoin is bought by people with,
it is about what price bitcoin is bought by people at.
The current Bitcoin capitalization is a fake.
The real volume of trading is a lot less than many think, just some hundreds millions. [
So  when people buy Bitcoin for USD they **totally rely on the price of Bitcoin in USDT** .
The Bitcoin price in USD is at the current high levels  only due to USDT.


Any other pair will be the same with USD/BTC as USDT/BTC is.
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:11:41


In short, LN is not.
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:50:27
Since there is really a lot of coins on this "master" seed.
I do not want to use this seed on an everyday basis into a hot mobile wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:57:42


 
Today when people buy Bitcoin for USD they ALWAYS **totally rely on the price of Bitcoin in USDT**  even doing not to know about it,  since the most popular price tracking sites (like, CoinMarketCap.com and CoinCap.io) **do not distinguish the BTC/USD pair from the BTC/USDT pair.**  
The Bitcoin price in USD is at the current high levels  only due to USDT.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:59:16
I have funds on my address starting with bc1.
And I have my private key for this address.
Via which wallet can I make the payment?
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:26:42
"Why is the existing keypair part important?"
Since there is already coins on this keypair.

it;s something like this but not exactly what I need
so how to generate a public key from a private key **EQUAL TO 5**  ?
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:47:48
" it would be a bad idea; all your security would come down to that one key. "
It is always so since with any BIP you always store only one seed phrase (which in a way is actually just one private key).
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:48:03
Even before creating a LN channel you can have problems with the government if your Bitcoins are  tainted.
Also your counterparty of the LN channel can have problems  after creating the LN channel if your Bitcoins are  tainted.

Just think,
Will a billionaire like to use this if his entire bookkeeping is in full view for everyone?

About this lon-term price I totally agree with you.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:52:24
" One way would be to - encode your 256 bit private key into a 24 word mnemonic  "
Of course I mean exactly it.
Again the question is the same, --
Will my initial private key from which I get my new seed/mnemonic (by BIP44) be a part of the new created tree of keys? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:06:01
I got you.
I am ready to take these risks since EACH SUCH initial private key/address (and then the whole tree) will not content many coins.
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:44:09


First of all, I like LN. It will help adoption a lot.
Even before creating a LN channel you can have problems with the government if your Bitcoins are  tainted.
Also a counterparty of your LN channel can have problems  after creating the LN channel if your Bitcoins are  tainted.


Also I have already said my supporting arguments **above**.
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:51:29


I have complicated feelings after your post
especially accounting your multiple answers. XD
If without joking It is not the case.
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:12:58
Of course you should
since you have the lost profits and probably will have them yet.
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:21:52
Actually, Bitcoin has not this property now since it has pseudo anonymity.
Please also read other branches .
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:40:41
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:16:26
Thank you.
I got your thought.
And I have already written about it, --
" I am ready to take these risks since EACH SUCH initial private key/address (and then the whole tree) will not content many coins. "
So I need exactly this thing as I said.
After all as I understand the BIP44 (that you suggested) also does not provide this thing?
