Going to an exchange that offers dark pool liquidity. Right now I know campbx does tradehill did when they were still running. Dark pool liquidity allows orders to be filled off book so that huge orders don't eat the whole book and cause massive price shifts

Air VPN. No logs accept bitcoin dozens of servers run by Italian hacktivists. Not too expensive either

What bank will transfer $10,000 for free?

Thank you so much. That feature made no sense never once did it ever find an address I used previously. Just random ones I've never seen before

I second the chase private client services they've been good to me. Only thing has been for international wires to japan or Slovenia (gox or stamp) I get confirmation calls from fraud protection and they lock my account but all I need to do is say  yes I did initiate this wire go ahead and they clear everything up very quickly
However.  In the United States any person selling bitcoins on localbitcoins or in any other capacity is technically breaking the law.  So funneling your localbitcoins sales from cash deposits thru your bank will look strange. And if found out (customer mentions bitcoin to the teller etc) the bank will close your account to protect their own asses from FinCEN for facilitating an unlicensed currency exchange.  This goes for all banks and credit unions unless you have been properly licensed on both the federal and state levels as an MSB

It's the price your pay for convenience by tapping into the liquidity pools of the ATM operator  It's not easy or fast to get into bitcoin online your first time

The current protocol limits to 8-9 Decimal places at the moment. But it is designed to be easily altered to accommodate infinite division should the market decide it's needed

Unfortunately for one there is no such thing as total "built in" compliance  even with the RoboCoin price tag, (as an American RoboCoin customer I've spent more than the cost of the machine on compliance and legal measures already, and i still cant launch for several months)

Awesome. I can buy a car in coin in Boston now. But I'm not looking to buy a car. I'm looking to sell mine.  Any chance you'd like to buy a 2007 VW Touareg for coin :) ?

Local bitcoins maybe. There isn't a lot in the us space yet. At least with any sort of volume. Several exchanges kinda disappeared after the dwolla incident.  I just can't wait for dwolla to disappear now.

They would seize the machines and all the associated bank accounts for operating an unlicensed money transmitter business.  It's not someone giving me trouble. It's the way regulations work in the US. Even Lamassu (another bitcoin ATM company) requires buyers to submit an affidavit saying that they contacted a lawyer about the legal liability to regulators in the United States
