Linux is on the list.

Do you have a link to that? I wonder what makes it more secure. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:26:41
In Florida?

Finally BSD gets its moment to shine! Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris all vulnerable. BSD not listed. Quick, everyone install one of the BSD variants! 
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:31:09
God damn it. We were so close. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:25:54
Nope. BSD, a UNIX-like system, absent from the list. This is finally BSD's chance to shine after all of these years in the shadow of Linux. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:11:54
Doesn't BSD support everything Linux supports? I've used it for servers and it worked great. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:24:55
Not all types. BSD is absent from the list! Not that it means anything. But they hacked Solaris for some reason. I wonder who's using Solaris. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:13:48
Pretty sure it says Mac's. Also Solaris which is odd. I didn't realize it was still used much.

iOS 9.2 was listed as the latest don't know the age of the document so don't know it iOS 10 is or not. No idea on the others. Can you run those on modern hardware? I mean if you just want something they can't exploit I'm sure BeOS is probably safe. Even at its peak it had very few users. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:20:03
Linux is on their list. BSD however is not. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:25:50
At one time this was mostly true. Pieces of FreeBSD with the MACH kernel (or Mach? I dunno). It's changed a lot since then. Some years back Apple went through the process got it certified as a UNIX variant. So yea, started with FreeBSD and went from there. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:11:06
Count me in that group. I'm a Mac user. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:54:50
That makes sense. For some reason I thought it was NetBSD that was security focused. I've only used FreeBSD myself and even that was years ago.

User friendly only means so much though. I don't think you can beat Ubuntu for being user friendly. Pretty much anything you could want to install likely has a package for Ubuntu or you can compile with little effort. BSD isn't nearly as popular so of course less ready-made packages. You can install Linux compatibility, but then why not just run Linux. If BSD is in fact more secure, that could be a good reason. But I think the bigger thing is to find out why one is more secure and use that knowledge to improve others. I'm hoping with this big leak we'll see great strides in security.

Linux is on their list. Windows, Mac, Linux, and Solaris. No mention of BSD (which means nothing but just something I noticed)
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:17:59
Does it matter? Windows, Mac, and Solaris were listed. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:09:45
Linux is listed. As is Solaris. BSD not listed but that doesn't mean it's safe. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:43:54
iOS 9.2 is exploited. Why run it at all? The question is have they exploited iOS 10 and more specifically 10.3 which I believe is the latest. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:23:45
Maybe UNIX? Probably Win 10. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:59:03
Completely failed to answer the question that was asked. Well done.
