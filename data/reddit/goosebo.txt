Yup stop watching the price too closely guys! 
If you're here for the gains then hodl on for the ride, you're not going to make any money buying and selling and predicting lows and highs!

I like it it's a much more natural progression upwards, which is where it is ultimately going. If this straight line went on we would certainly see a crash.

The price is fluctuating like crazy right now. I don't think there is a good answer as to what you should do. This could easily be the start of a correction or maybe the Illuminati, like no one knows.

I tried to buy bitcoin on Coinbase yesterday but the transaction is still pending. Has anyone else experienced this?

The key message Warren Buffet is giving is that if you think something has value, hold.

I bought £500 worth yesterday (which I am kind of regretting right now) but it doesn't really matter because I plan to hold for at least 5 years...

Coinbase is down!

Honestly, all for taking risks when investing, but this is insane. You should pay off your debt and house first and then consider risky investments like this if that's what you want to do. I hope it works out for you, getting rich is a marathon but hey ho... maybe you'll be retired in a few years... or much poorer. I expect it will be one or the other.

It's hard to say whether it would be a waste, I personally don't think so but no one really knows what's going to happen. I would be prepared to lose that investment and also to hold it for at least a year.

This is true, that bitcoin doesn't have 'intrinsic' value, but this is also something that we've never seen before. I think bitcoins value isn't just in the trust that people are putting in it, or the mania that is partly driving it, but that it is a revolutionary idea that could become the 'currency of the internet'. Basically no one knows what is going to happen, bitcoin could get substituted for another, better crypto currency, or it might flop.
What it comes down to is that no one knows what's going to happen, you have to act according to your own belief. My belief is that bitcoin will form part of the future. I think if bitcoin is used as an accepted currency then its value will only increase. I am only willing to bet 4% of my savings on that though.
But this is why I said "if you think bitcoin has value, HODL". Ultimately you have to decide what you want to do - but never invest more than you are willing to lose.

Bitcoin is so volatile it's hard to say what you should do. I personally don't think it's a good idea to try and sell the highs and buy the lows, especially due to the high transaction fees. Price is what you pay, value is what you get, I say HODL.

I really don't know whether to buy into this 'dip' or whether this is actually the start of a crash!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:44
Surely a crash is imminent? It opened today at $13.6k and so far has hit $15.9k - this is absolutely manic. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:44:26
Time will tell, my friend. Bitcoin is certainly the riskiest investment I've ever made but I think it has the potential to give large returns over the next few years for what is a relatively small investment. 
The fools are those who aren't prepared to lose what they've invested. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:26
Time to grab a pint and wait for this all to blow over.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:41
Hey what's the best way to track its price? At the moment I'm using  and watching Coinbase and Bitstamp.
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:53:56
All or nothing, kinda stupid, but it could work
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:10:47
When I bought in at 12K or so my plan was to hold for at least 10 years. I will continue to do so. I didn't buy more than I can afford to lose and when I invest I invest in value, which I still believe crypto currencies have, and investing in value requires holding for a long period of time.
