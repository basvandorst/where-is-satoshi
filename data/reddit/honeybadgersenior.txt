It seems that at the current stage, there is nothing we can do about the transaction as we cannot impact the blockchain. Sorry for the inconvenience. 
Hello CEX.io support:
It's been over five days since you have sent my transaction with such an extremely low fee (22 sat/ B).  You cannot claim that it's not under you control.  In the contrary, it was  completely and solely under you control when you had decided to pick 22 sat/B for my withdrawal transaction...I see it is still waiting in line, but your fee keeps letting people keeps perpetually cut in front me.  The line is only getting longer - waiting for how long is reasonable, two days ? Two years ?
Once again, claiming that your customer's  transactions get stuck unconfirmed on the blockchain - because you don't give them any choice - as you decided to pick the extremely low and unreasonable fee for your customers withdraws is solely under your control !!
On the perhaps of all your customers and the victims of your bad business practices ( borderline unethical), we demand that you to fix your mess as soon as possible !

You are right.  I have att for ISP and they use dynamic address.  It's been a couple months and I've not gotten any luck with it (too busy to try) - I will try static IP next...

I own both Trezor and Ledger Nano S.  - and I can access to my bitcoins from both Hardware Wallet so not to worry.  The wallets only act as the bridge to your coins - not actually holding your coins at all.  Soon if the exchanges get their shit together and implement Segwit, you could practically access to yours coin from any wallets

Here we go again...like a broken record.  It's like explaining gravity to a two years old kid, and they keep coming back with the same questions and debate all over again...
1). There are things that worth waiting and fighting for.  And instant fixes will not cut it !
2). Time will tell which approach to the problems at hand is the correct one.  Would you and your Jesus messiah (or whatever the heck he calling himself these days...) please get off your beating drum and be respectful to others - especially on this forum ???
I stop debate with the Bcashers because we've been to this many many times now.  Keep nagging the adults will not going to change our mind - so you spoil brats could get your first millions and your stupid Lamborghini...
Btw, to the adults in the room:  please do not get bogged down with details they throw in front of you...that will just encourages them to keep going...

Plan for the worst and hope for the best.  This applied to life in general, no matter what you do.  There are things that are completely out of you control- worry and sweating about it everyday is just not going to do anybody any good.  You have got to enjoy the moment.  With some luck, one of these days you are going to be rich in cash and memory !
Just be sure you only invest in what you could potentially lose - other than that - enjoy the ride - it's not just the money, but an experience of the life time !

As an American I  agree with your statement.  We are the highest energy consumers in the world (per capita).  the biggest holder of nuclear weapons.  We are in no position and certainly have no moral authority to preach peace or energy consumption to the rest of the world.
Regarding blockchain mining power consumption:  
Make up your dam mind:  
1). Do you want bitcoin with some utility values, or monitoring value/ cost built in ?
2). Or do you want to save energy and hug some three ??  Which is, honestly very hypocritical- especially coming from the same SUV drivers, shopping addicts whose consume most of the world natural resources..,
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:46:53
You are simply an idiot-  learn some basic understanding of the technology of bitcoin/blockchain before you shoot your little mouth.  Ignorant people whose doesn't understand things in life often come up with conspiracy theories to explain their lack of knowledge...
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:39:16
The golden rule of bitcoin investment:
1). Do not invest more than what you can afford to lose.
2). Those stupid enough to use credit cards or re-mortgage their house so they can be in is now in a middle of panic sell !  Good ridden, because they are not in it for the long haul...
3). You don't sell low and buy high:  no matter what !!
4). If you own bitcoin up until a couple days ago,  please do not sell - that's just flat out being stupid !!
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:36:09
Good point:  in fact, blockchain was not meant to be expensive - accept there's a little two words called "Game Theory".  After all we are only human (for now)...
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:47:49
I agree !  Nothing has changed in bitcoin technology- if anything is LN about to be realized.  So if you believed in bitcoin and bought it the first time, then the same fundamental values are still there (but better).  So bull is coming soon !
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:47:56
They are pumping right now as we speak - and dump tomorrow !
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:38:32
Do not buy high and sell low !!!
So those whose are selling today must have taken a lost due to panicking.  Unless they bought bitcoin months ago they would be taking a lost.  Which means that they violated all four rules - they have weak nerves and should not trade bitcoin again !
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:18:00
This theory may be ok, accept the dump started around 3:00 AM on EST.  So either some very early  birds Wall Street - or European banks... not too much talk about European ?
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:39:48
The people of South Korea did more than other countries would have done (like in the USA or Europe) - so here's the respect - thank you !

I think it mostly boil down to how much do you believe in bitcoin.  Not just the speculation of how well it will do - but rather, how strong do you believe in blockchain and how much do you think it will change the world as we know it...
I HODL bitcoin coin because I believe in it.  Like some of the good causes, the good guys don't get to win half of the times...but I also believe that the good causes may fail at first, but will always come back in the end...that's how nature work.
If you have some doubts then your heart is not in it...you can't fight a battle that you don't truly believe in.

1). Chinese miners are packing up their shops and moving out of china.  Up until now, some of them have extra bitcoins (from mining).  
2). Miners have shorted bitcoin to protect their assets- they will loose their bitcoin values but gain their short.  So, cash out bitcoin is the right move for large Chinese pool miners...
3). Even Binance (Chinese exchange) has packed up and moved out of china to Korea.
4). After all of this settle down, bitcoin price will shoot up again...fuck the newbies panic sell - fuck the whales. !!
5). If you have a $100k laying around, you could be a proud new owner of  ~ 10 bitcoins.  Remember a couple months ago - didn't you wish you could own some bitcoin- now is your chance to be a millionaire in a few years !!!

I love all these so call experts:  they completely missed the crypto revolution - because they haven't gotten a clue of what is the technology is all about.  Some new buzz worlds they had picked up and throw around such as:  decentralization, distributed consensus, and proof of work, etc...and all the sudden now they are offering their "expert" opinions... they could go fuck them self !!!
As the usual Wall Street and Finance mumble jumble:  These guys will talk about evaluation and utility.  How is this for your evaluation:  Bitcoin will take your Fiat trashes and use it for toilet paper !!  Sounds good to you ??

For those whose been whining about "high fee", which is no longer the case at all !!  I just now transferred my bitcoins from Ledger Nano S to Gemini with the amount of ~ $30,000 usd via "fast confirmation" and the fee was $30, which is ~ 0.1 % - and it happened in less than 1 second.  THE KEY TO TAKE AWAY IS:  you must convert your coins to Segwit.  Here's how I did it:
1). Transfer you bitcoins from whatever the exchange you've purchased it to your Hardware Wallet (Trezor or Ledger Nano s) as soon as you bought it.
2). Choose your account in Hardware Wallet as SEGWIT.
3). After that your coins will be transacted as Segwit and it will be cheap and fast moving forward.
So, all newbies:  please DO NOT listen to FUDs bullshits - convert your bitcoin to Segwit as soon as you can - then you will not have to deal with the high fee and slow transaction any more !! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:00:34
Gemini, Gemini.  Did I say Gemini ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:24:59
First of all I have moved quite a large amount of my bitcoin ( almost everyday).  My bitcoin never "stuck " - moving around between, Gemini, Bittrex and my Trezor - never get stuck - so don't understand what going on with yours !!
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:01:14
Agree - Come on people  !  You own bitcoin but you don't know how to move your bitcoin to a wallet !!  How did this happen - time for some googling !!
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:55:55
Now you starting to sound like the Bcash shrill !
The fee is only temporary while the core are working on the solution.
We have gotten to stop acting like spoil children every time we are facing with some challenges.  Remember bitcoin and blockchain are completely new phenomenons that nobody have ever experienced or witnessed before...Satoshi (who ever he or she or they are) had great vision of the future, but it is very far from perfect...
We are in a mid of a revolution and evolution- we could at least have some patient and be more supportive -- rather than whining and crying and taking and demanding like a bunch of spoil brats !!
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:41:32
It has a lot to do with you being new in bitcoin simply because you bought in bitcoin later at higher price 17k, 18k and you are panicking.  I paid $1000 for my coin - that is when the virtue of patient comes in - because even with bitcoin at $14,000 I'm still gaining.  As the matter fact I bought some more bitcoin tonight at $13,500 and now it's already come up to $14,800 - yes, you should go fuck yourself !!

As many people already said:  simply Demand vs Supply.  There are billions of people around the world would like to get in to bitcoin to own a piece of hot potatoes.  We could expect more people get pay on Friday and getting a Christmas bonus checks and use it to buy btc - If there weren't the day traders taking profit and the whales manipulate the bitcoin price, it would have gone up even much higher...
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:26:01
Yeah try that and let me know if you need help.  I must admit, the Technical instructions now a day are terrible, and often get written by some young geeks, whose assume everyone already know the stuffs that only exist on the writer heads ...plus I think Ledger Nano is a French company ��
I'm an automation engineering with graduate level of education and over thirty years experience - I was struggling to set up the wallet at the beginning...
Best way to do is open the instructions on your smartphone or iPad, next to your computer and follow it to the teeth - step by step...

@_date: 2017-12-23 04:11:09
No worries buddy- once you join bitcoin, you will find out this type of cycles happens very regularly:
For example, almost exactly the same thing happened in 2015:
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:09:31
Can you go in setting I find out what the next options ?
If you sure you do have your 24 phrase words, you could just enter the wrong PIN number for three times to ensure that it really reset and restart it all over again.. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:21:29
If your coin is already in your address, it remain there indefinitely until somebody withdraw it...it is important that your coin has been sent to the correct address - if not, it may be seating somewhere in the bitcoin heaven or some new lucky bitcoin owners...the fact that you said you reset your Ledger Nano S and now there's zero balance, that tell me that you may have accidentally wipe out your account...but not to worry, you could easily re-create your account by using the "recovery" option on Ledger Nano S.  but only if you still have your 24 phase words.
1). Reboot your computer trying to reconnect again and check again.
2). If your bitcoin are not in Segwit account but the legacy account, and you still have your 24 phrase words, you could actually see your account in Electrum.
3).  If you still have your 24 phrase words, you could actually recover you account from a new/different Ledger Nano S or Trezor ( using recovery mode)
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:40:03
Ok based on what you've said "hedging" means:  someone short bitcoin at a price and then turn around and buy bitcoins - just in case if the future price is higher, they will have btc to cover the short...but that doesn't seem to be the case here ??

Yep me too - I was able to buy some more discounted bitcoin ��.
I honestly think, there are lots of newbies, who's gotten no clue about bitcoin and Bcash.  They panic sold btc and bought Bcash purely on speculation shill and misinformation...
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:12:28

Not just Venezuelan, I'm talking about all over the world...including the US...have you heard of the trillions dollars of the US deficits?? And the fed printing/ spending the money like the drunken sailors ??
Soon the USD will worth nothing when people discover the true !!
Up until now the fed has gotten away with it by continuing to print money and pay for the interests of the trillions dollars in debts - as long as they could pay for minimum interest amount. Nobody notices.
But up until now, there's no other alternative...USD is actually better than any other currency - until bitcoin come along... a Ledger (account) system that is decentralized, distributed, which is accountable and validated openly by everyone

What I don't understand is the sequence of events:  bitcoin sell-off yesterday, one day before CBOE open this afternoon at 6:00PM.  I understand up to this point that people cashed out to wait for the down - for fear of the future short, which causing btc price to crash, and get back after CBOE settle in....but, starting this morning, btc price had started to come up again...I also understand that people jumped in because of the cheap btc...but isn't that too prematurely ?  Shouldn't the price hike happen after CBOE. ?? Nothing really happened between yesterday and this morning ?? So why the price increase now ?
EDIT:  never mind, I start to see BTC price is dropping now !

If you order using Amazon Prime, you'd get free shipping and fast, some time in the same day.  Plus, Amazon manages the transaction including verifying the seller.  As someone else has mentioned, it's best to buy directly from Ledger Nano or Satoshi Lab ( the manufacturers).  Also, be sure they arrive stamped sealed.  Definitely don't ever buy these devices second hand...

As usual, a disruptive technology (such as Blockchain) emerging the world finance, facing a lot of adversaries - directly challenging the controlling power forces.  What do we expect ?  I do agree with your assessments.  Just because that we are short of objective evidences, it doesn't mean that the devils don't exist...
We bitcoiners, whether we are in it for the glory, for the money or just for the pure principle blockchain visionary, we are in it for some tough battles.  Whether it will come from the left (bcash), or the right the greedy Wall Street bankers, or the front facing of the tax men from the fed - it is all about money and powers - let us not forget about that !!
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:28:41
Fair enough - and I understand and respect your point of view - please go ahead and follow your principle  and get out of bitcoin.  We shall meet again and see which path turn out ok.  I hesitate to even call who is right or who is wrong - because there's no such thing !  But it's rather who's lucky and who's not lucky...

Where was the other address created ?  It should be the one created by your wallet and locates on you wallets - if not, then it doesn't belong to you !!  This is strange...if you said the "other" address is not on the Ledger Nano, then it's not your address...
This may be  already done - but  Just to be clear:  when you send some coin from an external location (e.g. Coinbase account).  You must get your exact  "receive" address from your Ledger Nano S - and then request a withdraw of your coin (from Coinbase) to send to your known receiving Ledger address right ?  Just like the email system: you must tell people your email address so they can send it to your correct address...
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:42:54

So don't take it personally, the best way to do is to do some research and try to understand what's really happening in depth...here's the good place to start, with lots of good source of information:
I started in May of this year beginning to take interested in bitcoin (seriously).  At the time, I started to google- and boy, did I get a lots of misinformations.  There were so many YouTube videos, where guys were just look at you in the eyes and straight out lie to you...really sad...so be careful of what you see or read on the internet

Gemini is typically trading about ~ $800 higher than Bittrex.  When the price of btc was $16,000 because Bittrex was trading with USDT (Tethering off of USD).  That is simply a 5% premium that USDT is charged.  Another world, people don't deposit USD directly to Bittrex, they buy USDT at 5% premium...in the end they all come out the same...

You seems to know so sure MR. Philosopher- where is your empirical data or at least historical data.  All we have seen so far is Bitcoin value has increased throughout the years with occasional corrections such as what happening currently...you think the so call "high fees" and the "long Tx waiting" are the big problems and somehow will destroy bitcoin then you should not have anything to do with bitcoin and blockchain.  You should look back in the couple years ago of what bitcoin has been through and still come back stronger and bigger -so keep you skepticism and sarcasm to yourself !

I don't sell - I just accumulate my bitcoin portfolio.  Although due to the volatile market, there are lots of people day trading for short term gain - e.g. a couple thousand dollars a week (or more).  But it is very short sighted on their part...because it could be high risk and they could loose their shirt off...and they may be missing out of earning millions in the long run...

You need to learn blockchain and quantum computer:
1). A new block would be confirmed every 10 minutes no matter what.  The software (bitcoin core) will adjust the Level of Difficulty, in such a way that a new block  would get confirmed approximately every 10 minutes, so that the last block will be confirm at a set time in 2041.
2). Quantum computer will not make the bitcoin mining faster - no matter what.,,
3). What has been speculated is that the Quantum computer may be able to "crack" the private ID of the bitcoin holders, which potentially allow the bad guys to access to bitcoin wallets and steal bitcoins.

I agree with you partially, however, your key word you said here is "want a strong dip":
1). How the heck could anybody to predict the price of bitcoin 30 days from now ?
2). Base on what we have seen so far, 30 days from now price could be $30k.
3). Now if there's an idiot who is dump enough to short btc at $18k how the heck can anyone to get the btc price to come down from $30k to below $18k - let's say $17k to make any money?? It seems to me is such an impossible task to accomplish - am I missing anything here ?
Al I've seen far is - anybody who even think of short bitcoin is suicidal !

It's amazing to me that many of my friends and family members have had extreme opposition to bitcoin with very little of what this technology is all about...essentially bitcoin was flat for a good two or three year before starting to get attention.
I recall to hear a piece on radio about bitcoin ~ three years ago (2014).  It was about a reporter live for one week strictly with bitcoin.  I came away with some conclusions:
A). Bitcoin was too unstable to be used as a currency ( there was not much of the stored value either)
B). Bitcoin was rarely accepted by businesses, other than drugs dealer, money laundering, distortion, or dark money...
So I had lost interested until the summer of this year...

Amazon vs ebay - ebay what ??  It's a no brainer:  one merchant goal is to protect the sellers and giving them any advantage possible vs a merchant whose goal is to provide the best possible service , price point, convenience and lightning  fast delivery to the consumers !  Give that to the consumer then you will win otherwise, please step a side and stop being a sore looser...
For those whose remember the "good old days" when buying something on Ebay was like rolling the dice- pay your money up front, plus what ever the hell the "shipping and handling" charge the sellers feel like charging the buyers and please wait for two weeks...oh and god forbid if you get cheated by the sellers - no protection for the consumers what so ever !!

Yep - because you are whining about bitcoin issues (no doubt bitcoin has issues).  But you completely ignore every bit of good things that it brought and continue to bring to the table - ignoring the fact that bitcoin is less than 8 years old -- that there are many smart and visionary people are working hard to make it better.

Agree, let's say the Winklevoss brother hold $17 billions in bitcoin.  Let's also say they are willing to risk selling off one billion $ worth of btc to manipulate a low price set for the future trade.  Let's say they time it perfectly so the future price locked in at the temporary dip price at ~ $17,500...but how the heck can they create another dip 30 days from now when the btc could be up in the $30K to manipulate the price below $17,500 ?? That seem to be impossible...

Coinbase was horrible!  They closed my account without even providing any explanation at all...
Gemini made it easy for the customers- could transfer funds from my checking account to Gemini instantly every day for $500
Gemini own by the Winklevoss brothers- the real inventors of Facebook.  They own lots of bitcoins themselves - so it is in their best interest to protect bitcoin.  Gemini service is very good - whenever I have a question and ask, there's always answer the next days at the latest
The Gemini apps on my iPhone is very users friendly -  I could transfer money, buy and sell my coin on my mobile phone anytime- instantly...

The bottom line is that they cannot sustain the dump for so long...because:  a). They will run out of bitcoin to dump.  b). Lots of people are waiting on the sidelines to get in bitcoin, so they will sweep them all up in no time...
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:55:48
Your theory is purely speculative and I have a hard time buying it until I see the real number to back it up:
1). You are assuming that the whales have that much of power to control and manipulate the ~ $300 billions bitcoin market.  Which infers that a handful of whales bought up all the gain in btc all the ways from $8000 to $19,000.  What about hundred of thousand of newly investors, who's signs up in Coinbase, GDAX, Gemini, etc..? Where did their money goes ?
2). Ok, so the theory of a handful of whales whose had  jacked up the price from $8k to $19k -  at the same time buying some shorts - and then turn around to dump the coin (profit  and gain the short 30 days from now (profit  in theory it sounds good - but what about billions of people around the world, whose have been waiting on the sideline to buy up every bit of cheap bitcoin. Wouldn't that blowup the whales goal out of the water ???
Why couldn't we simply accept or at least consider that the price coming up in bitcoin is just the result of billions of people around the world finally feel comfortable enough to invest in bitcoin (consider many REAL progresses and good news come out of bitcoin phenomenon) ??
Remember, for the first time a global trading phenomenon has been borne - effectively billions of people around the world could buy bitcoin (one way or another) - which make bitcoin price NOT a bubble !!  Over a billion of Chinese, if invested in bitcoin will make it a sleeping giant !!!
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:07:56
No no, if you create a new 24 word seed, you effectively create a brand new account, which has nothing to do with your old account...you will not see any of you coin in there...
You DO NOT need to buy a new Ledger Nano S.  based on your question, I am afraid you do not quite understand how the wallet work...you should spend sometime to learn how to use hardware wallet.  Read the instructions from Ledger Nano Website very carefully !!
1). Be sure you know your original 24 word seeds.  It is your best friend !! Do not and I repeat:  DO NOT share your 24 seed words to anybody, under any circumstance!!
2). Reset your Ledger Nano S wallet as it was brand new when you first bought it ( follow instructions from Ledger Nano website).  In fact if you enter you PIN number in wrong three times, it will automatically reset(wipe out your account).  Now, start you newly reset wallet - but DO NOT create a new account !  Instead, perform a "recovery" account (once again please read the instructions carefully).  With this, you should regain your original account including all your coins was in there...
Good luck !!

So what ? At this date and time, bitcoin is still learning to scale  - it will take some time.  To do it right and not rushing it and screw it up royally.  I am willing to pay $18 to move a couple grands worth of bitcoin, which is still way better than banks. I don't need to get permission to take my money, and wait for five business days for it to clear - it's still a better deal.

Wall Street has missed the bitcoin/ blockchain boats and they would like to have a "re-enactment"...but try not to give future trade as some kind of powerful influence on bitcoin...In fact, once billions of people around the world truly discover the potential behind this technology  - they would quickly abandon the "piggy bag" investments and jump on board with the REAl investments (with bitcoin).

@_date: 2017-12-15 08:04:43
I guess I didn't explain my point clearly,   It's not that easy to get bitcoin price essentially flat - not an easy task, unless every one stop trading around the world, which is not the case here...I mean with every $ gain, there's a minus dollar to counter balance, and versa vice - not an easy thing to do...What's the point to pour more money in if it's continuously held at $16,500 ?  On the other hand, it would be more difficult for an average new person to get in and own a bitcoin if the price continue to shot up to 20k, 30k,...so from that point of view, I guess you are right !
One scenario is that the big whales could decide to sell bitcoin as soon as it goes above  $17,000, and buy below $16,500, so all the gain in the long run will get sucked out by the big whales...
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:01:19
Different scenario for me:  don't know your personal situation, e.g. Profession, how old you are and how much money you're currently making?  But, in my case I make pretty decent salary, plus I'm in my middle  age.  I would truly HODL and wait for the big pay day when it hits 1 million...of course it's completely based on how strongly you believes in the technology and its potential.So I would wait until the bitcoin hit the moon ! In the few year and retire from working for others and do what ever the heck you'd like...if you have a good job and get pay well now then just HODL...
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:13:55
I kind of agree with the OP - although, the capital letter seems unnecessary ��
1).  Creating dip now to win short for the future doesn't seems to make sense at all.
2). If anyone want to win the short game, they would have to artificially inflate ( making higher) the btc price now (temporarily) so that 30 days from now it would be easy to manipulate a lower price to win the short...
3). Making the "low" price now, which make the future price even higher !!  That make dipping price today harmful for future short !!!

You still don't get it - some people like myself do not plan to sell anytime soon - so it doesn't matter how much the price is.  When bitcoin price goes up to 200k or 500k, does it matter that much if you paid 10k, 12k or 14k ??

Yep it doesn't matter if you reset the Ledger wallet your account is still there, you didn't reset your account, you may have created a new account, which is why you could see you coin...
Btw, you could have as many hardware wallets as you please with the same account.  In fact, I have at least one Ledger Nano S and another Trezor wallet,which pointing the same account and 24 four phrase words.  They are the redundancy, in case you loose one, you just simply use another one...
They are like multiple copies of your house keys (accept you have to know the PIN number to use it).  But if someone else know it they could open you house wide open...if you accidentally loose one if your Ledger Nano, you could create a new account with new phrase words, then transfer your coin from old to new account.  So if anyone whose found your wallet with the old account and even have the phrase words, there nothing in the account to steal...kinda like the situation you found yourself in right now...��
Good luck !

1). If I understand correctly, originally Satoshi was open to the idea of bigger blockchain.  But then he quickly realized that it could possibly open to cypher-attack such as "deny of service" by bombarding bitcoin network with "fake" transactions, which could potentially shutdown bitcoin network.  He then hard coded in to limit blockchain to 1MB - this did not happen by accident.
2). As mentioned by others, bigger blockchains will centralize bitcoin blockchain  greatly and put the faith of cryptocurrency into the hands of few greedy bad actors.  One great example is if anybody notices that Bitcoin network doesn't really have any company that running it ?  It is truly by design for the sake of decentralization.  On the flip side, have you noticed that Bcash is running by a handful of assholes ?  And they are pushing to gain even more centralized powers by spreading even more mis-information- and pushing for larger block sizes so eventually only big expensive computer could access to blockchain...

Yeah not implementing Segwit on the major exchange is a huge mistake...Coinbase, Gemini, etc...
They will pay for the price soon.  They are all just greedy and not responding to the customers needs...
On the other hand, fuck them... my Trezor and Ledger Nano are supporting Segwit just find...and when I send the coin from my wallets, I get low fee just fine...

Your story doesn't make sense at all.  I have a Bittrex account and I deposit and withdraw btc in and out of Bittrex on the daily basic and never get asked for my identity...with all due respect, but your story sounds like full of BS:
1). Where did you deposit your BTC from ?  Exchanges ? Wallet ?
2) Where did you withdraw your BTC to ? Exchange? Wallet ?
If you cannot explain the questions above, we could immediately tell that you have made up this BS story to get attention or sympathy...
Are you looking to get some sympathetic rich bitcoin owners to send you some btc ?  Here's some BS btc I'm about to send you...
You know what bother me the most ?   I'm not even a big fan of Bittrex, but I think they have done an OK job.  For you to make up this bs story to discredit Bittrex, which have done a decent job of serving consumers, I think that you need to get the f--k out of this forum...

I have already boycotted Coinbase and switches to Gemini a long time ago...I really don't understand why Coinbase is so popular while Gemini is providing better services ..?
One good reason to trust Gemini is because the Winklevoss (the owners of Gemini) themselves whose own lots of bitcoins - it is in their best interest to protect bitcoins.  On the other hand, Brian Armstrong the founder of Coinbase has publicly expressed that he would be more than willing to give away any custom information to the government upon request- as he will pimp his customers on the fly...

To be exact:  Supply drive Price.  Price is the side-effect:
If the supply goes up, the price goes down.
If the supply goes down, the price goes up.
But, this only works with a limit (fixed amount of coins - just like bitcoin in this case = maximum 21 millions) amount and decentralized (in theory nobody control bitcoin).  Altcoins, trashCoins, scam coins and Fiats do not work this way.  Because they keep printing more coins.  This is why bitcoins is more valuable.

Ok - the latest update of bitcoin price (as of this writing) is $8707.  This is the reality guys:
Who ever selling bitcoins currently, will buy them all back PLUS some of the weak hand bitcoins CHEAPLY !  These SOB will gain a lots more bitcoins -
I honestly don't blame them- I think they are greedy bastards - but hey, it's an open free market.
Bitcoin/ blockchain fundamental and technology has not changed at all.  If anything, it has been gaining a lot more recognition and legitimacy.  If you have some extra cash in your bank, now is the time to buy.
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:05:41
Just to add on a couple more points:
1). People think $7k, $8k or even $16k per bitcoin is too high - guess what ?  They are dead wrong - here's why:
                       - Each bitcoin is equal to 100 millions Satoshi.  If I did my math correctly, you could buy approximately 15,000 Satoshi for $1 (based on the current bitcoin price of ~ $7,000).  Wait until a Satoshi worth more than one US dollars, which means your investment will be 15,000 X more...
                       -  So considering you invest $1,000 in bitcoin today, when one Satoshi become higher than one US dollar (which is just a matter of time), your $1,000 investment will become 15 millions dollars !!
                       -  Here's why it will happen:  all fiats are worthless because they are being printed everyday by governments to artificially pump the economy today...soon, the USD, Euro, Chinese yuan, etc will become worthless.  Gold and bitcoin will become the main trading currencies - accept gold is not a good choice due to many obvious reasons ( I'm not going to waste time to explain it).
 2). There will be approximately 7.3 billions people around the world, who will competing for 21 millions bitcoins as the mean of trading wealth.  But not to worry, we will have lots of Satoshi to pass around - unless we allow a hand full of a.. holes to hoard all the bitcoins today...if this happens 2 to 5 years from now, please don't say I didn't warn you.
3). Have anyone seen such a pyramid scams that lasted for 10 years ?  Even Bcash, Ripple and Eth scams have only been around for a short period of times and already are just about to fall off the clip...
4). Notice:  nobody here even speak about Blockchain technology- because most people are clueless about the technology behind bitcoin (especially on this forum).  If they spend a little time to learn, they wouldn't feel so bearish about bitcoin.  Why Warren Buffet made so much money in stock market ?  Because he bought the stocks at the bottom, when everyone else thought that the stocks were about to crash...does it ring a bell ??  Why bitcoin price came down so low ?? While there are many good news and progress happening in the bitcoin world ?  The answer is FEAR and IGNORANCE !!!
5). I'm not saying that bitcoin price is at the bottom - may be not.  But it doesn't matter.  Even if bitcoin price goes down to $1 it still doesn't matter to some people.  If I see bitcoin price goes down to $1,300, I promise you, I will borrow any pennies I could get to grab any bit of bitcoins I could get my hands on !
6). Bitcoin is an equivalence to democracy of the financial world.  And the governments, banks and Wall Street in the modern time are like kings and queens in hundred of years ago.  Imaging somebody walking around in the town square speaking about democracy and freedom ?  They would most likely to get their head chopped off - and a lot of that did happen.  And that is what we are seeing now in the world of cryptocurrency.  If you are in the business of printing money and controlling money from the world, would you just seat still and let bitcoins take over? Hell no !!  
PS:  for those whose are just about to jump on my ass for my grammar or spelling -- yep, I'm not a native English speaker either.  So, go F..k yourself !
For the idiots whose insist in put the $ before the numbers - why is it so important to you ?? You and your inches, feet and yards can go f..k yourself !

Some comments here tell me that you guys still  missing  one of the most important fundamental principles regarding to bitcoin:
The most important thing is to stay anonymity.  You want to isolate your bitcoins from everybody and everything around you.  If you still don’t understand this important reason - then you’re missing the point why people want to own Bitcoin in the first place.. 
 
Remember this:  banks, governments, exchanges, and financial institutions are not bitcoin friends...
Yes, security, banks and exchange are stealing your money and your bitcoins...

The $ = dollar.  When you speak, do you say you have 500 DOLLARS or do you say you have DOLLARS  500  ??
Dollar is a unit of currency just like Euro, Peso.  Or for distance as mile, or temperature as Fahrenheit.   Do say you have Euro 500 or 500 Euro - Do you walk 5 miles or do you walk miles 5 - is the temperature at 70 Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit 70 ??

To your point:  I just transferred 5 bitcoins from Gemini to my hardware wallet, and it costed me $2.48 - for the transaction fee - instantly - yes, I'm not kidding !  So, bitcoin doubters shut your mouth !!
For the Bitcoins doomers:
Since when can you transfer:
1). $41,000 US dollars 
2). on a Saturday, 
3). no 4 to 5  days waiting for the fucking bank to approve and clear - no holding period ?
4). Nobody needs to know who's sending and who's receiving...

Remarkablesnowflake8:  apparently there are 7 others in front of you..,
You have made lots of claims:  “flawless”, “better than Gemini”, “real heroes”, “hundred of transactions” without any substantial evidences to back it up - are you sure you are not Brian Armstrong ?
My personal experience was terrible.  I had went out of my way to provide my identifications and everything required by Coinbase, which I finally had gotten approved to open the account.  Only for few days later, I received an email by Coinbase stating that they closed my account without any explanation.  I was instructed to withdraw my bitcoin ASAP.  
BTW, Coinbase never issued me the Bcash from the Fork...

Talk is cheap, show your sincerity by do something tangible to help new comers and make bitcoin stronger.
