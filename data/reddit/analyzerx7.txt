When you find any serious bugs or glitches, your best course should you chose to act on the bug you found, is to send a direct email to the respective companies support line, directly tagging the email as URGENT BUG FIX. This allows them to remedy the situation and usually offer a bounty (Depending on how critical the bug was) 
Posting it on Reddit encourages others to exploit the same bug, while also waiting on the companies social media arm to hopefully see the post. Then relay that post to the correct department, which may be too late.

From the BitGo website
Where is the accountability of  BitGo here? a provider of bitcoin security, when they are fundamentally insecure? Naive of me to think that we were passed this phase of poor practices. We are probably another 5+ years off standardized security protocols/systems amongst top level Bitcoin companies.

Thanks for sharing this, this whole situation may lead to some very unsavoury circumstances for Bitfinex and their respective users as an indirect action they chose to make. We will see how taking funds from unhacked accounts to cover the losses of the hacked accounts plays out. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:57:15
Bitfinex may have a claim here, to set a precedent and educate law makers who don't understand the technology. Any governmental arm should be more considerate when creating forced legislation around new technology, or pressuring businesses into positions which expose them to theft in order to 'comply'.

Bitfinex seizing their respective users USD balances, though it had no direct theft or correlation with the BTC hack, Is unethical and remiss on their behalf, It sets a dangerous precedent. I hope they fully understand what they are getting themselves into by 'confiscating' users fiat funds to compensate BTC losses, though they were not directly affected by the hack. They acted hastily in their solution here and created an unfair and possibly legal situation.

* Bitcoin sent via email without the recipient owning a bitcoin account? Would need some explanation on their security procedures and what this all entails, This all sounds dangerous for the end user.
* Reversible transactions are not a PLUS, NON-Reversible transactions are a key FEATURE that comes with bitcoin. Fraud was always abused with the ability to reverse transactions.

As someone who has mined on larger scales, I highly recommend that you do some focused research on a few key points:
* Cost of electricity in your area per kW
* How much hash rate worth of hardware are you buying
* Calculate how much BTC will you earn based on current difficulty + your hashing speeds
* How long will it take you to earn the BTC you invested (factoring average adjustments for increased difficulty)
* Depending on your scale factor in rent/cabling/secure networking/server racks/staffing/safety measures  
* Are you better off just buying the BTC and holding it long-term

They did not absorb any of the losses themselves afaik - rather they caused users who were not a part of the hack to absorb some of the blow. This is not a simple liquidation process, it was constructed with selfish interest first. Which is doubly immoral when the hack happened due to no malpractice of the user but rather their own lax security practices. Automating multi-sig and not having manual checks greatly decreased the robustness of multi-sig to begin with.

The solution they created, damaged users of their platform who were not hacked. It would have been more honest to create a slightly higher loss and BFX token distribution paid over time for the users who were affected. Rather than impact someone who is creating profit on the platform as a user who was not hacked, it now creates alienated and frustrated users who will simply cash out their fiat, Let's take you for example, though you feel relief that they did not go insolvent and have a repayment plan which is good, it creates a huge miss trust of the platform in general. Whether their intentions are good or bad, the actions they took will have consequences and you as a USD user were hurt by their quick action.

It is the first step towards people using the technology, they are scared so they use a trusted third party. They see it is not as difficult as they imagined and begin to use it themselves, change begins with small awkward steps.

Known bitcoin troll, with very little constructive value to any conversation. Spending full time job hours bashing anything Bitcoin.
Yup, sounds about right.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:29:47
I find a lot of people are giving their opinion about the plethora of reasons why Bitcoin is superior to our current monetary system. This may come across as a sales pitch over time, let's take a step back and let the technology sell itself. It's pretty fucking amazing, others will see this as we continue to improve on it and use it.

Thanks Visa &amp; MC - love how you protect me by forcing me to give my 'private keys' to every single merchant I interact with. On a side note, It titillates me when said merchant is then hacked and my key is sold on the darkweb for 50$ along with 10,000 other keys. Thanks for your protection, this would explain the constant string of nebulous charges I continually have to ask you to explain - appreciate you apologizing and reversing this ~~attempted theft~~ error.

Would you guys consider a legal section which shows the respective laws in the territories you operate in (as to avoid random bitcoiners being arrested)

Over hear a conversation on the phone between a big bank who needs a bailout and the fed laughing - zoom in on the fed printing press making money. 
Cut to the reflection of someone's glasses inputting code on a screen (the bitcoin protocol) then release it to the world. (Make sure you see what Satoshi wrote on the genesis block in the reflection.)  Start cutting to how it impacts different people in parts of the world and how quick and seem less it is.
Move to the fed yelling at a board of people asking them how will this technology impact their monopoly on the banking sector.
Cut to a scene with FBI and swat chasing a hooded man down an alley and they are getting closer until he makes a sharp turn into a crowded place and everyone's wearing a hoodie in the open market.
FBI stop and sigh and mummble we lost him...  Bitcoin "The people's bail out."

The upside is too great to give up on it now. Look at it as a long term investment - think of it as real estate which is before it's time, give the amenities time to catch up to make your estate value rise. Having said that, I don't know your financials, if you are in a bad position and need to sell - pm me and I'll hodl the line.

Probably because most people feel the emotion of anger when they sense injustice, a lot of social media and awareness are now looking at the banking sector more closely due to the creation of BTC.  Which is a good thing, let the truth come out.

Well... seeing as the technology is new... I am sure there are no direct stipulations which correlate to Bitcoin but... there are probably umbrella laws which will define it as an asset.. I would ask an attorney though as I am not really qualified to answer this question.. lol worst case scenario you convert everything to duckduckcoin and say wuts a bitcoin? lol
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:53:07

Agree, I don't think it is OK for USA to assume you are guilty because you use something they created when they wanted to remain anonymous. They then realized by sharing it with everyone it would create a more robust network and now they want take-backsies?  no

OP has your best interest at heart when he says don't mine, he doesn't mean it from a don't support the network stand point. Regrettably a lot of newer players enter this space and see mining and dive into it expecting positive ROI. Often time a cloud mining scam tricks them because electricity costs in their area are unreasonable. I started mining industrially at 6-7B difficulty. Take it from a miner, don't mine BTC for profit - just buy and hold (maybe experiment with some changetip giving or small purchases to acquaint yourself with the tech)

The block halving will create more scarcity which has less downward sell pressure and increases the over all value per coin. You are naively assuming the coin will continue a downward spiral into death, by the same negative token we can also assume a positive outlook and say oh hey 1M coins by 2017. Let us look at it in a pragmatic manner, the hash rate will come and go ebbs and flows depending on the value of the coin and the manufacturers fighting amongst themselves to give you the best price per GH

OP some of those points I agree with, I would also like to add one possibility - I used to mine industrially and also indulged in alt trading and Bitcoin hoarding. I noticed some anomalies in the Eco system. Hundreds of millions of dollars rolling out an insane infrastructure for Bitcoin... I stopped and did some math on what that investment would do to the price.. Then I watch blatant market manipulation and serious ones at that.. Forcing the price down.. This is not some magical happening or an agreed consensus of the free market. We are witnessing a price manipulation alongside an infrastructure roll out. There are some big mother fuckers out there who don't want BTC to sky rocket YET. When the build out plateaus and we see fresh money enter the direct acquisition of BTC. That is when we will party in moon town.. Imo

I would guess a Robin hood group who took some MTGox coins and are selling them back at way under market value, not flash crashing it to 100$ and ruining things. Just holding at 300$ and literally spreading tens of thousands of BTC at very affordable prices

You will be competing directly with the same people who sell you the product, we are hard pressed to compete against these guys. They sell us the hardware at 300% more than it costs them to make it, not taking into account that they already used your hardware to mine prior to shipping (more often than not) take it from an industrial miner my friend.

This is also assuming the coins being purchased are freshly mined coins as opposed to older coins, downward pressure by Insta conversion processors like Bitpay also force it down. There are a ton of reasons ultimately supply and demand and manipulation. But I understand the point you are seeing and trying to express :)

this was a quote from the creator of changetip. He actually said 1.50$ - I rounded down to be conservative.  My smallest tip is 100 bits while my largest is 40,000 bits so this 'rumour' of .0003 is unfounded

This is a part of the natural progression, as an industrial
Bitcoin miner we see the mining frenzy driving the difficulty to staggering heights (was at 6-8B when we started) this coupled with the price dropping will inevitably create a mining slow down, unless a large mining conglomerate pumps the coin so they can create a return for themselves. Regardless of the ebbs and flows of bitcoin, I mine, buy and will continue to hold.

I think there should be a degree of regulation for bitcoin related companies that allow you to onboard from the legacy system to the bitcoin system. Especially if they hold your funds, they should be reputable companies.
But regulating BITCOIN itself is just abusrd... If regulators attempt to do this, Bitcoin will grow teeth and growl... then they will wish they just let it run its course

As opposed to allowing trolls and completely unchecked clear manipulation? There is a balance, best to tread the line on it. If it was all sincere feedback from different people sure.

This would indicate the value per coin since you used the word "at" I would suggest saying you bought $185 worth of bitcoin, this would suggest dollar value. :)

Coinbase is operating in one of the most regulated Bitcoin climates on the planet, then add the fact that a massive bank is actually an INVESTOR in Coinbase and you get the whole picture. Expect zero privacy if you use their service unless you go to great lengths.

No doubt they will shortly be investigated by the appropriate authorities. In the interim I advise people tread lightly with such irresponsible behaviour, all the respectable exchanges I've observed have the appropriate channel structure via social media, I've seen continuous streams of complaints about this exchange, they seem to not care what so ever.
It's taken 2 years to resolve this issue? unless there are things OP is neglecting to say e.g. funds were received through illegal means and no KYC was provided etc (Assuming he wanted to withdraw to a bank in fiat etc) this was all handled extremely poorly and some accountability should be had here. 
Blocking the account of a user who has an unresolved 2-year-old ticket because he posted about it on social media, is the icing on the cake.
Good luck to you OP!

If someone gets under your mattress there isn't a popup asking them to insert a pin with a giant force field around the mattress. 
If they somehow get the pin (unlikely) there then isn't a second stage which requires a passphrase to cut open the mattress.
They just get the cash and walk out, it's completely different :)

They have been in operation for a damn long time - I have seen the pay out structures and compared it to our own yields on GHASH. The fact that they shut down is indicative of the reality they faced. I was asking myself how long were they going to subsidize cloud mining - I was on the verge of writing an article warning all people on their service to watch out... and then they shut it down - good for them.

Not particularly good at this but I'll give it a shot :D /
Staring up from the immense work he put in to this code, this masterpiece that will unravel society as we know it, Satoshi lets out a long contented sigh. It's a cold dreary day in England and Satoshi sits on his couch staring at the Bank of England through his window.  Thoughts cross his mind about the system and how it has oppressed so many countless people over the eons. He has finally come up with the solution, now he just needs to give it a name. His cats meow pulls him out of trance and he stares at a freshly minted coin in the palm of his hand, his wife yells from the bedroom "Satoshi all you do is code, come spend a bit of time with me!" ... A bit... A bit... He murmurs... His eyes light up with joy..  A Bitcoin! His cat meows in agreement, and the revolution begins.

* Camp One Ventures
* Core Innovation Capital
* FF Angel

Good for them for not adding to the already corrupt and scammy cloud mining. They realize the profit is not there even running at 100% optimal conditions. There is no profit to pass on at this $ - Can confirm as miner, shut it down and move on. Price spikes + moores law then hop back in.

Unfortunately the only sources which continuously debunk onecoin are Reddit, since most people are unwilling to research things before committing to them. 
This will continue to impact peoples' lives until authorities arrest the heads of this scam and shut it down, then the media picks up the article and runs with it. Creating some more visibility.

by then the scarcity of a single Bitcoin would be extremely high as opposed to the 25 block rewards now.
Assuming user acceptance continues on its current trajectory - a nominal transaction fee in BTC multiplied by the billions of people on earth would still add up for a miner.
By then we will also be using UAsics - Unicorn Application Specific Integrated circuitry. The diamond dust in the hair of a unicorn allows for hashing speeds up to a Yottahash per chip and only pulls one watt :D

It's ridiculous that someone who has openly stated that he has created a competitor coin which will make Bitcoin irrelevant and has also scammed countless people. Somehow holds a pole position at a conference called Miami Bitcoin. Imagine Apple CEO giving the keynote at a Samsung convention. Justifying your action to earn some revenue is short sighted and clearly displays you priority. To make money - just say so, If anything people respect the truth more.

k np - I expect a coin to hit 2k - Amazon and other top companies accept BTC as payment. More acceptance world wide due to media coverage and spot lights in main stream movies. Hash rates well into the .5 - 1 Exahash due to unicorn fart powered asic 2.0 machines - one government takes the helm and becomes Bitcoin utopia - I think 2015 will

Cold storage generally refers to funds which are always kept in an OFFLINE environment.

Charity and helping each other in society is definitely the bigger picture for me. Would be cool to kick start something which would be willing to show on the block chain, where its' respective funds go and how it genuinely makes a difference in the lives of many who have no way out.

What do you mean by this title? There should be varying denominations. In all global currency there are different ways to pay with each currency e.g. :
* 100
* 50
* 20
* 10
* 5
* 1
* .50
* .25
* .10
* .005
* .001
Etc etc
Forcing everyone to only pay with one of those denominations, could complicate things.

Shit man sorry to hear that :-/  - Hard to tell you what the right move is.. if pride will force him to put a wall up to pretend to be legit using ponzi funds or if he will cut and run... it is being dumped hard though.. as we speak.. across all exchanges :( - We all fall for one or the other.. there are hundreds of scams with thousands of promises.. just teaches us to do better research before committing to something I guess..

This is not taking into account the honest miners, your proposal is suggesting mutual destruction.
This is not our desired outcome, a desired solution would allow the honest miners to continue while removing the dishonest players.
Not destroying the entire system, this is not the idea.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:33:00
I don't think that antagonising the person holding the dominant mining operation on the planet.
Is a particularly well thought out idea.

Nothing new, with Bitmain collecting most of the fees and keeping 100% of them - it's subsidised in a tidy little loop.
Coupled with social engineering and you have his insidious agenda on display:
* Socially engineer a rebellion
* Divide the community
* Attempt to disrupt the network
* Use the new subreddit to promote your business interest
* Invest heavily in altcoins with the guise of "frustration"
* Spam transactions &amp; claim blocks are full
* Gain higher tx fees
* Socially engineer a demand
* Make yourself look like the victim
* Force your "better" protocol
* Altcoins pump you win
* Chain splits you win
So let's supposed your plan succeeds - But at what cost? Will the money be worth it in the end? you both already had enough to live a good life.
But this is about more than money for either of you, no amount of money will fill that emotional hole - one day you will see this for yourself.
Happiness cannot be achieved this way, the world is littered with deeply unhappy billionaires.

Yet here we are, we survived the 50 BTC to 25 BTC halving - and the 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC halving.
Have you noticed a trend? the price tends to jump to compensate for the lower amounts of BTC given, the correlation is noticeable. 
This time it only needed to jump from $300 to $600 to be more than profitable for the average miner - instead it pole vaulted from $300 to $1000+ not including the tx fees collected - Don't cry for the miners just yet.

what? Taking the economic incentive of bitcoin and using it as an argument in which you justify creating a new system that is purposefully attacking the old system is OK? Justifications like these are what criminal lawyers defend in court. This statement is so disappointing man.
Rather than winning off the merit of its superior model and actual user adoption, you vote yeah let's attack it this is the premise bitcoin was built on? but this is not morally wrong to you? you just justified the attack of another.
You are standing behind a facade and observing your angle from a justified position. This makes unbiased observation impossible. And while you continue to hold on to this false belief, regrettably no truth will permeate your emotional investment.

This statement is nonsensical, if people were selling off their BTC in droves because the current system hit capacity.
There would be a higher number of transactions, surely you know that mempools are under constant duress from spam attacks? 
Your statement insinuates that there are less transactions because a ton of selling is happening, selling is a transaction.
Why would you support a dysfunctional centralised system, who at the centre of their agenda cry "censorship" when in reality they use social engineering to push an alternative and untested product, which is far more insidious than moderation of any kind. Care to expound on your thoughts here?

There are a few mechanisms which safe guard you in the creation process via the Trezor, it all depends on what you are keeping safe. If you have for example 2 BTC = $2300 USD Approx - is it worth spending $90 to ensure that is safe? probably.

By definition, a parasite is an organism that lives in or on another organism (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the host's expense.
The underlying emotion certainly lines up with your sentiment which is benefit to themselves primarily. There was no consideration for the eco-system or the ideals on which the technology was built on here.
The primary motivator was self-interest and a fear that the road map was not aligning itself with their best interests. While I agree that we should not blockade miners, I used to be one and understand the expense and effort it takes - We should NOT pander to their expectations at the expense of the networks over-all well being.
It was always a consideration in the back of my mind while I was watching the hash percentages on the various pools match up with the amount that Antpool suddenly took offline, it was clearly them creating a myriad of pools using various names.
Given the economic incentive for miners, it only takes one person or one group with the understanding and where with all, and the right emotional driver to become the dominant player in this market. What was surprising to me was how quickly they exposed their hand in attempts to force the market through fear and dominance.
This will enable us to put counter measures in place should we be faced with this type of threat again, though it was an emotional roller coaster and like yourself, me and many others have significant investments in this technology. So we can rest a little easier for now.
Worst case scenario you would have 2 sets of coins on 2 chains, so ultimately selling before that happened. Would not be in your best financial interest, at the very least you can wait and dump both if you no longer wanted to be a part of the whole system.  Or you could dump the attacking coin and retain your original coin in the hopes that it recovers.
Good post  and thanks for sharing!

It isn't a bad perspective, if a government developed that attitude it would have:
1. Transparency
2. Accountability
3. Consideration
Those are good characteristics to adopt, one of the issues between most citizens and governments is a lack of trust due to an abuse of power.
This could be remedied with the application of certain principles.

Regrettably, r/btc will find a way to spin this; When people are cemented in their belief, whether right or wrong - they tend to do some of the following:
* Find a way to justify the way they feel.
* Minimise the issue so they may ignore it.
* Shift the blame in attempts to not feel any responsibility.
Whether it be logical or illogical is not relevant in this situation, since the underlying motivation is to maintain their emotionally invested position - not seek the truth on the matter.

Could not agree more, speculative investing with no actual economic multi-functionality is not loving at all.
It is basically justifying the taking of profit at the suffering or expense of others, as you correctly stated.
There must be a loser at some point, this goes for trading nearly any commodity however, the whole system is currently built on that premise, this is what we must work to correct.

@_date: 2017-03-23 22:40:04


You have a fundamentally flawed perception of this situation.
We are here primarily, due to the miners road map for profit not matching the users road map for usability and decentralisation.
regrettably coupled with Roger's aggression and rebellion towards a perceived authority.
We already saw what the math clearly indicate that when we scale to untenable block sizes, it does not put a dent in Visa's numbers. The layer 2 solutions which were offered do a far more efficient job with little, to no risk. 
I have compassion for the miner's situation, I owned an industrial mine in 2013 - but I would not hold the network hostage to increase my bottom line. I would also consider economies of scale as a miner, penny wise pound foolish. They are getting greedy, their business model already indicates they want the whole pie, not a slice of it.
The foundation has not been set by ASIC - it has been set by BITCOIN, ASIC is a natural evolution in computational advancement, coupled with economic incentive.
The conflict of interest is glaring here, I would not trust the keeper of the gate to have a vested interest in one singular aspect of an entire operation.
Greed is a destructive human emotion.

OTC transactions are usually comprised of the SELLER (Person who has the BTC) meeting up with the BUYER (Person who has the fiat goods/service) and exchanging said Fiat for BTC (Usually done in a public place)
Some companies like localbitcoin.com act as an escrow service for this process taking out the risk/hassle of meeting someone face to face.
be sure to do your research when sending your BTC anywhere since this can lead to you losing it, no recourse if you send it to the wrong place.

Unfortunately, node farms can be built by big miners, the deterrent being how cheap and simple it is to set one up. There is also some decentralisation there already, there is currently no economic incentive to run a node so everyone who does this *generally* wants to help bitcoin in some way or thinks it's a cool experiment.
Something to consider, should this be the only thing blocking a mining conglomerate from domination or coercion, especially if they can subsidise the node farm with the mining farm's profits. Always good to have multiple backup plans.

Always diversify in the event you have unforeseen circumstances, especially if you are looking at the possible future of your son. Be pragmatic on how you approach this technology and look for the best possible time to enter. Staggering your purchases gives you an overall average depending on whether the price rises or falls from the date you originally purchased.  Good luck and welcome!

His calm demeanor and non-condescending attitude is 100% a +1 - Have an upvote. He could have taken a moment to better explain the reasons as to why the supply and demand of the halving has real-world effects, as opposed to a "big potato chip."

Before giving any company/person your money/bitcoin - I **highly** recommend you do some research and look closely at a few things:
* Is the link you are clicking complimentary of where it says you should be going. e.g Click [here]( for google, when you hover your mouse over the click HERE you should see it sends you to YAHOO on the bottom left of your screen
* If the information being advertised LOOKS too good to be true or encourages you to click NOW before the timer runs out on this amazing offer!! - odds are it is attempting to manipulate you through fear, so be wary before clicking or downloading ANY file, especially .exe (executable files)
* Don't be afraid to research the product/service on the internet - use social media, google, you tube to look for reviews - check to see if it is a scam. Sites like [This]( can help - (I hope you hovered your mouse over that link before clicking it  :)  lol)
* Use logic &lt;3

he clearly manipulated a loop hole which allowed him to seize other people's money within the DAO - The spirit of the law as is always the case when examined in court, was that he did commit a clear theft and as such should be approached as a criminal, he is trying to justify an unloving and erroneous action after the fact.

The way in which this topic is approached makes it difficult for one to receive it in a constructive way. On Numerous occasions I tried to point this out to respected members of the community, let's try to discuss matters which correlate to important Bitcoin issues on the appropriate channels. Causing divide through these methods without offering concise solutions is damaging, not helpful.
From the limited understanding I have on this issue:
The problem arises from the uneven propagation of information in the network. While the propagation of small blocks is fast, i.e., every miner gets to know a new block approximately at the same time, this is no longer true for large blocks.
Large blocks take a lot of time to be forwarded to every node in the network, since this includes miners, these miners are unaware that there is a new block and they'll continue mining on top of the old parent, i.e., they will work on a competitor of the newly found block. This means that they are actively wasting their computational resources on an obsolete solution if the propagating block gets accepted into the blockchain.
Big miners are likely to have a better connectivity with the Bitcoin network, resulting in them losing less of their computational time due. This in turn puts small miners at a disadvantage since they are now less competitive.
The extreme case would be one strong miner, with close to a majority of the computational resources making such big blocks that everybody else learns about its blocks very late, while it already has spent considerable time finding the followup block.
The uneven propagation is due to both network latencies and verification times of the block that is being propagated, so this is a compound problem from both slow verifiers and high latency/low bandwidth.
Ultimately this may possibly lead to some serious centralisation of mining, which we want to avoid. We want to build solutions which move in the opposite direction, we want **decentralisation**. Sacrificing in the short term for this goal should not be approached nonchalantly, though I see you genuinely believe you are doing the right thing. Let's take a step back and look at our competitors, we are basically the Flash versus 80's kids on roller skates. Let's make sure we get this right before we create bigger problems.
This isn't to say that the goal of having a larger block is not a good target, the question is how do we get there without compromising some key components.

This is what happens when people skirt around issues in an unloving manner, if the interviewers just flat out said how they felt. She would be directly confronted by them asking the truthful question, at which point she would either be *able* or *unable* to answer the question. If she tried to justify or deflect the question they could clearly get back on point while focusing on her deflection etc - all while trying to be loving. Not mocking etc - with clear illustration as to their true motive.

@_date: 2017-01-03 09:18:00
Sure, happy to answer this question, it's a natural progression on the road-map and The Lightning Network is pretty cool :)
* **1) Putting funds into Lightning**
We both send 0.05 BTC into a shared 2-of-2 multisig address. This requires a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.
As a "balance sheet", we each create a 2-of-2 multisig transaction that pays out 0.05 BTC to you and 0.05 BTC to me. I sign one payout transaction and give it to you. If you want to put it in effect, you need only add your own signature and broadcast it to the Bitcoin network. Vice versa, you give me your copy of the payout transaction that you have signed and I have not yet.
These "balance sheets" are regular 2-of-2 multisig transactions in the Bitcoin network, they're just isn't valid yet, because they are each missing one signature. Note, that these unilateral payout transactions lock the paid out funds of the executing party for some time.
* **2) Payment**
Now, I want to pay you 0.01 BTC. We each create a new payout transaction ("balance sheet") as before, but this one says that you get 0.06 BTC and I get 0.04 BTC. Each of us gets a transaction signed by the other to that effect as before.
To make sure that neither of us can use the old payout transaction the other signed previously, we each create an "anti-cheat" transaction: It's a transaction that spends the outputs from our first payout transaction to the other.
I.e. when I try to activate the (now obsolete) 0.05 - 0.05 BTC balance sheet, my paid-out funds are locked for a number of blocks. This gives you time to broadcast the "anti-cheat" transaction in which I signed that my 0.05 BTC output gets send to you directly.
Still, it's safe for me to give that transaction to you, and the whole network, because the "anti-cheat" can only be activated as a response to the fraudulent use of an old balance-sheet. By the way, this anti-cheat mechanism is why Lightning needs the Transaction Malleability fix from Segregated Witness.
With the setup as described above, I'd have to be online to catch you trying to cheat, but obviously it wouldn't be safe for me to keep payment channels open, if I'd have to remain online all the time. So, to encourage others to help with the "anti-cheat" transaction, we set a small portion of the "anti-cheat" payout as a bounty that anyone can spend. Now, we can entrust the anti-cheat transaction to all nodes on the network, so everyone can watch for old balance-sheets being broadcasted. When it happens, anyone can sign the bounty to themselves and broadcast the "anti-cheat".
* **3) Network payment**
Alright, now you and I can send money back and forth thousands of times, with instant effect, yet without adding a single transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain. Yet, on the other hand, if one of us ever tried to defraud the other, they would be instantly taken to court by having the dispute resolved on the blockchain to their own detriment. Pretty spiffy, but not terribly useful yet.
By the theory of six degrees of separation, everyone is connected to any other participant by only a few hops. Let's say you want to send money to Bob, who is a barista and just made you some coffee. Bob is a friend of Alice, while I have a Payment channel with Alice. For illustration purposes, let's assume that each payment channel has two BTC in it, equal split. You do not have a direct connection to Bob.
The "network" now looks like this:
    You &lt;-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --&gt; Me &lt;-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --&gt; Alice  &lt;-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --&gt; Bob
Now, since you don't have a direct payment channel to Bob (and it would be very inefficient if you had to create a payment channel with every business partner you ever meet), you route your payment through the network. Instead of only writing an update of the balance between Bob and you as I described above, this becomes a concerted effort: Your wallet finds a route from you to Bob that has a) sufficient liquidity, b) least fees, and c) fewest hops. To make a payment, each involved payment channel updates their balance. With a payment of 0.01 BTC for the coffee, this updates our network to:
     You &lt;-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --&gt; Me &lt;-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --&gt; Alice  &lt;-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --&gt; Bob
As you can see, the balances at the ends have shifted appropriately from you to Bob, but the other participants have the same balance (although shifted to other payment channels). It's important to realize, that the transaction can only go through completely or not at all. Either we all update the balances, or no one does.
Now, imagine that you don't have only the one payment channel with me, but you have maybe a dozen payment channels with other users! :)
* **4) Consensual channel closing**
Other than in the above case where one side closes the channel unilaterally, one of us can request of the other to consensually closes a channel. When we agree, we create a final payout transaction together that doesn't lock any funds and allows immediate spending after confirmation. We could even use this transaction to spend some of our balance directly to a third party on the blockchain, or to create another different payment channel.

My one take away from the division and insidious behavior which has been demonstrated time and time again is: It's one thing to disagree with someone or a group of peoples opinion.
It is another to actively recruit/find people who wish to discredit and spread hateful propaganda about another group, the sad thing is a group think evolves from this. Where most people have not actually done research for themselves, but rather trust the collective feeling. When this feeling may be right or wrong.
This is basically what has happened in our community, and it is a pretty sad state to be in.

There has been a lot of posts on social media hyping up the so called short comings of a situation which are not readily what they seem. Please note this does not represent my position in any way on whether or not this could be an actual problem, but rather to raise awareness on what seems like 'Concern trolling'
Let's look at some things that are happening:
* If a user paid around [3 cents]( which is a fraction of the [recommended]( fee, they would have their txs confirmed in around 2 blocks
* Any user paying the recommended fee will continue using BTC as though nothing has happened
* [This]( user pointed out the possibility of BTCC's block priority service as being one vector of spam attack
* The instant upvoting of these posts on reddit while the fact remains distant is a warning indicator - [Here]( you can see that it has come down significantly while posts fly up stating incorrect facts
* In my investigation of users which are promoting this [Problem]( the majority reside at - please note this is not to divide anything further, just an observation that 75% of front page was at one moment pointing to direct posts from users of and new accounts claiming "The sky is falling."
Ultimately there are solutions which are being implemented to help the system grow. For now, pay the recommended fee's or wait a while and it will be processed.
If you are a strong believer in the real issues concerning bitcoin, use the proper forms of communication to expound on your idea. Fearmongering is not a loving or beneficial solution to anyone in the long run and ultimately hurts the one ideal most of us share. Which is for Bitcoin to thrive.

If you are looking to exit the Bitcoin eco-system and have access to the banking system.
* Make sure you understand the respective laws/taxes of your territory
* Once nothing is illegal you can opt to use the banking system to withdraw your money
* Depending on your territory you can use a Bitcoin ATM which takes a lot of drama out of it (Your transaction will be recorded for their KYC/AML)
* If you are looking to sell a large amount there are companies out there who act as escrow for larger purchasers e.g. gemini.com

This may show some slight miss understanding on how fungibility works in bitcoin. bitcoin is divisible up to 100 million. So we have: 
* 1 Bitcoin
* 1 million bits
* 100 million satoshi
This simplification gives you an idea of how economies of scale would function in poorer countries. The same way fiat currencies have a plethora of denominations. e.g.
* $100
* $50
* $20
* $10
* $5
* $1
* $0.25
* $0.10
* $0.05

 Bitcoin Unlimited tracks the "most work" chain. Let's say the current active chain tip is block N. If block N+1a is an "excessive" block, that block is essentially considered a fork. The active chain stays at N. If the "excessive" fork grows beyond a parameter we call the "acceptance depth" (A), then it (N+A) becomes the active chain. 
If people ignore the excessive block and mine a block N+1b then that becomes the active chain tip and the excessive block N+1a is orphaned. The BU client "helps" the network ignore the excessive block by refusing to relay it -- this allows the client to essentially "vote" for its block size preference.

At first, it is all exciting - Maybe even the only thing you want to talk about at social events... after the years pass and you become seasoned in the salty tears and the glorious pumps - you won't even bring it up... 
But others who remember that you have been in it for years will see you and instantly calculate their missed gains after they ignored your 'bitcoin' advice back in the day. 
They will then ask you tons of questions, you may even get a bit annoyed by the probing, but you will start speaking about it again like and like an old relationship the sparks you have for bitcoin will re-ignite. 
The last phase is when people stare at you and you can feel their self-judgment, They won't be able to maintain eye contact for long periods of time because this will bring up how different their life could have been should they have bought that thing you told them about in 2012... Their pain will be insufferable - You will find yourself attempting to reassure them that there is still some potential upside - and why don't they start with $10...

Though I appreciate and even adhere to the sentiment of holding long term, let's not mock the poor decisions of others.
Especially when their motivation was generally a reaction based on fear, usually a fear of loss.
I'm sure they have a knot in their stomach or a slight headache when they think about it, some probably bought back in through the same emotional fear based reaction.
Such is the market and the emotions which drive it.

Precisely this, it is one thing to desire profit for a company. But to do the following is simply not ok:
* Create Bitcoin Unlimited (Riddled with bugs)
* Cause massive hate and upheaval in the community alongside other noted members (Roger Ver)
* Have such a strong desire to profit that you are willing to potentially undermine the entire system your machines are built to secure.
* Disingenuously present a facade to the public while hiding your true motivation.
* Not considering the impact you have on the entire ecosystem in pursuit of profit, which you have clearly already made a lot of. Or worse, not caring about the consequences once you turn a profit.
I would need a years supply of soap to wash that taste out of my mouth, you have deeply disgraced the community and lack moral fiber Jihan.

Here are some foundational considerations:
* The principles upon which the governance are founded should be derived from motivations ulterior to fear.
* The systems of governance deployed should be immutable and succinct.
* There should be automation 
* The system should operate with consistency and non-bias.
* Decentralisation and transparency should be an inbuilt function of the system. 
* Economic Multi-functionality should be carefully considered and implemented within the system.

Though social engineering and manipulation can work, it does not come without a steep price -  tricking people will never be a good practice and it always has its own set of undesirable consequences.
Let's not stoop to this level to deploy what is clearly a well designed and beneficial code for the entire eco-system.
Segwit has been reviewed extensively and welcomed by nearly the entire community, with the exception of one bad acting miner who unfortunately controls the majority of the hashing power at this time.
I would suggest we come up with truthful and upfront ways to roll it out legitimately and defer from acting in what we deem to be a justifiably malevolent action.

For those of you who don't know who Craig Wright is:
* Craig Wright listed a PhD in computer science from Charles Sturt University on his LinkedIn profile. But the university told Forbes that it only awarded him two master's degrees and not a [doctorate.](
* In 2004, Wright was convicted of contempt of court by the [Supreme Court of New South Wales.]( He was sentenced to 28 days in jail for breaching an injunction that prevented him from approaching customers of DeMorgan Information Security Systems, which he resigned from in 2003. The sentence was suspended on condition of performing 250 hours of community service. After appealing the decision, the ruling was upheld in 2005 and also in a subsequent appeal to the [High Court of Australia]( in 2006. [More info here]( 
* He is the founder of the cyber security and computer forensics company Panopticrypt Pty Ltd
* Wright was the CEO of the technology firm [Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Group]( which planned to launch Denariuz Bank, the world's first bitcoin-based bank, though it encountered [regulatory difficulties]( with the Australian Tax Office and [failed]( in 2014.
* 2 May 2016, Wright publicly claimed to be the creator of bitcoin. [Link here]( [here]( and [here](
* His claim to be the creator of Bitcoin was debunked, Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik agreed that evidence provided by Wright does not prove anything, and security researcher Dan Kaminsky in his blog concluded Wright's claim was a scam. Craig Wright confirmed that he would provide extraordinary [proof](
* His "extraordinary proof" was that he claimed he would sign a message with the 'satoshi's keys'-- but what he provided was a copy of the signature extracted from the second transaction in the blockchain, wrapped in layers of obfuscation to make it seem like it was a signature of a message he provided.
It was thoroughly debunked shortly after posting it (This point compliments of **Edit**
* He then posted a statement on his [site]( which has since been expunged:
 &gt; I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot. When the rumours began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this. I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, and particularly to Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen. I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions. They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I’m sorry. And goodbye.

Under the false pretense of some twisted grudge against the only people actually offering solid code to the project, derailing the entire proposal and cause people tons of losses BOTH in time and money, those who traded fearfully and those who worked diligently on the code.

Unless this post is just him posturing, If he continues to purposefully block SegWit, this would be a clear contradiction to this posts sentiment. In the end actions will speak louder than words!

For those people that [don't know who Nick Szabo]( is:
* Nick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency.
* In 1998, Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralised digital currency he called "bit gold". Bit gold was never implemented but has been called "a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture."
* A participant would dedicate computational power to solving cryptographic puzzles. In the bit gold network, solved puzzles would be sent to the Byzantine fault-tolerant public registry and assigned to the public key of the solver.
* Each solution would become part of the next challenge, creating a growing chain of new property. This aspect of the system provided a way for the network to verify and time-stamp new coins, the majority of the parties had to agree on the new solutions, or they couldn’t begin the next puzzle.
* When attempting to design transactions with a digital coin, you run into the "double-spending problem." Once data has been created, reproducing it is a simple matter of copying and pasting. Most digital currencies solve the problem by relinquishing some control to a central authority, which keeps track of each account’s balance.
* This was an unacceptable solution for Szabo. "I was trying to mimic as closely as possible in cyberspace the security and trust characteristics of gold, and chief among those is that it doesn’t depend on a trusted central authority," he said.

A lot of exchanges have a list of KYC 'red flag countries.' [India]( for example.
I would suggest you have all the appropriate documentation ready for the exchange process given your address.
Most of these exchanges have to comply with the government/banking law of their respective territory. It is generally not a punitive decision made by them, as it restricts their growth metrics and general userbase.
Alternatively, you can try [LBC](

Unfortunately, he is beyond reason, many before you have tried to speak logically and politely with him.
We still find ourselves here, he is driven by his selfish desires and has no care for the economic well-being of others.
Another interesting point is someone who presents himself as a philanthropist, i.e. Roger Ver has allied with Jihan Wu who clearly could not care less about anything beyond the bottom line.
This in itself also speaks to certain truths.

Nice suggestion, I guess the only risk here is in freezing the base layer no further amendments can be made if need be, we would have to assume that it is perfect in its current state.
So I don't miss understand anything, would you be suggesting that the innovation on layer 2 could circumnavigate any issues found on layer 1?
I do agree though that creating something and allowing it to exist without always needing maintenance or updating should be considered, automation is a valuable and underutilised function in most protocols. Thanks for sharing

You justified the position without any consideration for emotional clarity, you are saying that because someone owns something - this gives them the right to do what they wish without any consequences?
They certainly have the right to act as they deem fit they have free will to do so. But suggesting that if I own a gun it somehow gives me the right to threaten someone to do what I desire, and expect that this will not have an equal and opposite reaction.
Is not clear thinking.

You are condescending while remaining ill-informed, everything has structure.
Creating a structure is necessary for ANYTHING to work, this is not controlling. Proof of work, for example, was structured to work a certain way, now we see one bad acting miner possibly hijack the system.  USAF is another form of potential governance presented.
By your definition, one would assume coding controls. Your miss directed anger here is towards abused authority, not proper governance.

When Roger is entrenched in an illogical argument which he is losing. Especially if it impacts his economic interest, he does not possess the humility to step back and admit an error was made.
He tends to find another angle to make the same point, and repeats the same argument until the more technical people in the room just sigh and stop bothering to converse with him.
Others in the room who are more easily swayed, pander to his stubborn nature. Often trying to convince him that they understand his perspective but (insert logical counter argument here) etc - Eventually they also understand that this has no effect on someone who does not wish to see anything other than their opinion.

Interesting concept, investments have always been perceived as a set financial definition.

Denial?  Unfortunately, people will argue blindly in favor of their respective belief. This is different than objectively and logically assessing a situation. Unkind sentiment between high profile characters regarding this topic, has blown it up to disproportionate levels. 
Technical things take time and effort to scale safely, Bitcoin is a not a break it and see technology. I did not say ALL people who believe we should use big blocks asap are ignorant, some are actually technical and I take the time to understand their concerns and perspective. My desire is for Bitcoin to succeed, I try to not let my opinion mar facts and logic which will aid in the longevity of Bitcoin.

From what I understand, an investment is the purchase of goods that are not consumed today but are used in the future to create wealth. In finance, an investment is a monetary asset purchased with the intention that the asset will provide income in the future or will be sold at a higher price for a profit.
When something is purchased with the clear understanding that historically it has always gone down in value (depreciated), it should not be considered an 'investment'. Why would you invest in something that is guaranteed to go down in value - you would purchase that, without any expectation of a return on your purchase.

Generally speaking, an equilibrium is defined to be the price-quantity pair where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.
 It is represented by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. The analysis of various equilibria is a fundamental aspect of microeconomics:
A situation in a market when the price is such that the quantity demanded by consumers is correctly balanced by the quantity that firms wish to supply. In this situation, the market clears.
Changes in market equilibrium: Practical uses of supply and demand analysis often center on the different variables that change equilibrium price and quantity, represented as shifts in the respective curves. 
Comparative statics of such a shift traces the effects from the initial equilibrium to the new equilibrium.

100 bits - we are having a food drive right here in Barbados, I'm personally in charge of how this operates so I know with 100% certainty that all funds will be used to ACTUALLY feed people as opposed to a small % - which is unfortunately how most charities work due to 'management and staffing costs'

The more research you do and the more you understand the disruption happening in the space, the more comfortable you will feel.
I trade so hard I view bitcoin as my safe haven from shitcoins... Imagine?  Feeling safe with bitcoin... would call me a savage lol
Having said that, my risk appetite is high - and I would not advise you to take actions you cannot emotionally handle should the shit hit the fan.
Good luck and welcome!

If I sell anything which is legal, and the funds are in the government's respective local currency. In my bank account and they tell me this isn't actual money... i.e. a "funding source" - I would immediately close my account and move my business else where. This goes beyond governmental regulation, it's miss management or de-risking.

* PayPal is definitely not more secure than Bitcoin - 100% not true - bitcoin is more secure and more private

Fascinated to see how this all pans out, though the government straight out said they will not bail this bank.

Though the number of coins are limited (which is great for long-term value as you pointed out) each coin is divisible up to 100 million :) which allows us flexibility within the 21 million cap.
Similar to how there are different notes in the USD system and even coins, a denomination I'm comfortable with is Bits - there are 1 million bits within a single Bitcoin.
If you like to geek out on information check [This]( link out, otherwise don't let it overwhelm you - Just pick the one you enjoy and go with it :)

Apologies if my first take on your comment was negative, after rebutting so many paid/ignorant trolls sentiment of this technology, I have a slight knee jerk reaction on this social media platform. Your points have validity and I remain hopeful as you said that there will be triggers this year, the effects of supply and demand coupled with overall network development should have a significant impact but only time will tell.

Seeing Bitcoin VISA cards sends me into a mental cluster fuck, why would we take a new technology and shove it into an antiquated system which has proven unsafe/inefficient/invasive. The only justifiable reasons I can currently see are "This is something I am comfortable with and understand." + Immediate inclusion in the current legacy system.
Though this has its place it should not be what we strive for, perhaps a similarly easy way to use this new technology. Built on top of a method which compliments the technology as opposed to integrating with direct competition.
Having said that, perhaps a bitcoin credit card trojan horse is what we need in this spot. Only time will tell

But if segwit in itself is a solid way to increase block size allowing roughly 1.7x the amount of Txs which can be deployed, why stop one which is a soft fork pending the confirmation of a hard fork which can lead to further ramifications. Please explain?

Though by definition Money laundering is the process of transforming illegitimately obtained funds into ostensibly legitimate money or other assets, this was definitely a click bait title which can be miss leading - Bitcoin is a technology which is neutral in nature, using it to try to do something illegal does not make it inherently bad which is what is implied every time something bad happens.

There will ever only be 21 Million bitcoin created, currently there are 15,543,850 BTC (approximately) in circulation.
In 57 days (or so) the total number of bitcoin released into the system every 10 minutes will be cut from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC - this many hope will have an impact on the over all price, historically this has been the case.
I would recommend you buy bitcoin once it does not put you in financial squalor or cause others around you duress (using other people's money etc)

Every time I read about banks crying "Bitcoin will aid terrorism" I think about HSBC and their KYC/AML Mega fuck up to the tune of BILLIONS of laundered terrorist funds.

First seriously consider understanding the technology and protecting it securely. If you are unwilling to do this then hire someone who will do it in a manner which ensures your best interests are protected.
I highly recommend a hardware wallet which is easy to use such as Trezor, for an amount this large I may even consider multiple hardware wallets (you also have the option to create a plethora of securely passphrase encrypted wallets within ONE device)
After you understand BTC or how to secure it, you may either purchase BTC off exchanges and move them slowly to your hardware wallet OR purchase in bulk with many of the larger entities which sell BTC to private companies and/or larger players.
For further information on which exchanges and/or bulk purchasers you can PM me, I don't want to plug anyone.

Exactly this, you can make the same point without causing your userbase suffering or personal losses. For all he knows some guy sunk his life in looking for a way out, lost it on the dump and now has no way to pay the mortgage - can not stand to tell his wife or look at himself in the mirror so he shot himself. His daughter has no dad, though he is a grown man and took all the actions.
The initial action which acted as the catalyst was taken by the creator of this same token, which led to these unfortunate set of circumstances. Then he creates a troll video and thinks it is all lulz? Pretty sad tbh - shit turns my stomach - and that is coming from me, a guy who enjoys a good lol.
There are right and wrong ways to do things on this scale.

It seems a few people were affected by this. I Appreciate your diligent response as you took the time to explain your train of thought regarding encouragement of copycats etc. The concern is if numerous people are affected including a moderator of this sub-reddit. Would you perhaps show us how to mitigate this attack should it become a problem? If they were not actually affected directly I apologise in advance.

I agree with you on the singular version if it sounds and reads correctly in a singular text. Applying plural to it seems unnecessary and even awkward in some contexts.

The fact that this was upvoted to the front page when it has 50 sats/byte and is promoting ViaBTC is sad...

Go promote your shit service elsewhere, you helped create the problem and now offer a solution for it? GTFO.

If we all stood still as a collective and stagnated while 20-30 years passed - then sure, the possibility exists where Quantum could threaten bitcoin through the public key / private key pairing.  But that is unlikely as there are a lot of intelligent people already coming up with ways to combat this possibility.

hi, unfortunately a very new account asking for Bitcoin only is suspicious. This happens more often than one would think, so we do not entertain brand new accounts asking for Bitcoin. If this is in error I apologise but we do have to safe guard our selves as well.

You, speaking about honesty gives me a fucking stomach ache. Though I appreciate the information you are posting here, your motivation for posting it is disgusting.
* You create a three-day-old account
* Nearly every post in your history is related to slandering Trezor
* Other posts are related to promoting their competitor, Ledger
* You praise the creators and staff at Ledger 
* You slander the creators and staff at Trezor
I would probably be a little more interested if your agenda was not as transparent as your inability to execute it.
The fact that ledger wallet creators are literally on every single thread which has the words TREZOR in it, promoting themselves while slandering their competition. Is reason enough for me to never buy their product.
If your product is good it will sell, resorting to these primary school tactics speaks volumes to any intelligent member of this community.
Again thanks for the info, but stop slandering. Or at the very least stand behind your convictions without hiding behind a shill account.

This has reached the point where the entire community, both sides! are tired of the constant bickering and grandstanding.
Why not just split off? If Roger or BU are unable to have reasoned and logical discussions to explain their positions with technical individuals within the core community, while deflecting any point made and yelling "FREEDOM OF SPEECH" or "SATOSHI'S VISION" - even though they literally do a more insidious version of censorship coupled with some clear conflicts of interest which even breach the Reddit Terms of Service agreement. What is the point of continuing discussions under these circumstances?
Why do JiVerBu sit there stirring shit up and continue to bitch for what feels like a lifetime... It doesn't make sense. There are elements missing here.
The top [three]( posts are Roger bitching about Core, just solve the scaling issue already if you supposedly have a working product and hashing power. If your product is superior and meets the criteria the community stands behind it will be used more, it is simple.
Stop acting like a gangrenous limb that infects the entire space. Just fork the thing and let's get on with our lives, or stop actively blocking progress and constantly throwing hot tantrums and hop on board, it's exhausting. 
 let us enjoy the $2000 per BTC ATH for a minute without the pink Himalayan sea salt, thanks.

The world of digital is based on consensus. This means, everyone. Each and every person in the ecosystem is looking at what you are doing. Even counterfeiting. When you attempt to counterfeit while everyone is looking at you, it won't end in a positive consensus.
The general agreement would be that your bitcoin is no good. No one will accept it or entertain it as legitimate, the consensus will ensure of that. The distributed ledger will reflect that. 
It might not be impossible, but the chances of you fooling the consensus, are zero.
We only learn by asking others who know or by seeking the truth independently - happy to help in any way :)

Only advice I have for you is check the laws for selling tickets and holding an event in your area. Bitcoin doesn't make us exempt from the law it just puts us in a grey confusing area lol. Sometimes law makers use small simple cases to make an example of people and throw the proverbial book at you, don't be that guy. Tired of seeing normal people getting abused by over zealous frightened governments

This is a complete abuse of the network, there should be repercussions - not some flippant comment which holds little to no regard for the users who were affected by this. What a terrible way to run a new business, way to alienate yourselves from the community gentlemen.

Your question is multi faceted. Your primary expense as an industrial miner is electricity. Your break even point will depend on the price of kWh in your region + rent + staff etc depending on the size of your operation. The lowest I saw operate at break even was 190$ But that was some amazing systems they had in place to cut costs. AC was an open window into the arctic circle with industrial extractor fans.

Discovery analysis in the hidden message:
* 1. The inverted W before the crash in August 2016 is a fear based market reaction
* 2. The Double loops in Sept &amp; Nov 2016 have a Fibonacci spiral which shows confidence
* 3. The Jan 2017 dip prior to the inverted U shows a persuasive recovery leading into a bull run
* 4. The ~~word moon~~ moon factor has been embedded in the ~~background~~ prediction model
* 5. ~~I made all this up~~ I'm an expert

If they tried to control the supply, the price would greatly increase making it harder and harder for them to acquire more. While giving users profit for goods/services

One of Bitcoin's features is its function as an immutable ledger confirmed through mathematics to display the truth. THIS, if used by the world would eliminate lies in governments/banks/charities, not sure if it is a solution to combat privacy however.
@_date: 2016-05-08 05:45:48
Yeah this makes sense, let's use the world's first immutable ledger of truth backed by mathematics and raw power, to leave a clean and provable trace as we try to hide in the broad day light of network verifications.

The ant miner or spondoolies imho - depending on which hash speed you buy expect it to pull around the energy of a large air conditioning unit. Expansion using air/sun is extremely difficult - we were over loading our 300amp breakers before expansion plans kicked in. Solar was not feasible in our region due to cost and the sheer amount required.  I really do not suggest you solo mine. You will never find a block with 350 PETA hash as competition. Pick a top pool (e.g Ghash or any other PPS or PPLNS) it guarantees a small consistent return. (Thanks for the tip!)

Scammed may be a miss representation of the situation, sounds like you ran into KYC. I don't see why a PASSPORT is required for a level 1/2 user who is withdrawing/depositing crypto only. Usual policy is a form of ID and a proof of address.

Since you asked I'm happy to point out which things don't necessarily look true.


You cannot assume to know the operational expenses of 90% (or vast majority) of the bitcoin network. Ranging from Rent/Electricity/Staffing/Misc - Each miner has a business model suited to his/her territory allowing them to either be profitable or not.


Impossible for you to forecast the profit margins of mining for everyone in the network, there are lots of variables you do not have access to. E.g. A person mining using geothermal power in Canada with his cousin won't have the same return as a person mining using a monster generator in China with 5 employees and two warehouses.
- Ultimately there are numerous investors who have channelled serious funds into the Bitcoin ecosystem - to the tune of billions.
If you look at the math of what it would cost to move Bitcoin to say $900 and sustain it for a while you would see it is not a fraction of the cost invested into the system - I am not predicting nor showing you a solution, just giving you insight into some possibilities and some math. Ultimately a lot of large conglomerates want to see this technology thrive, I would be surprised if the price did not accommodate to match the halving in the coming months. But only time will tell.

It is worth noting, that Coinbase has acted with very little morality or ethics here. Theymos has acted in clear favour of the bitcoin community while explaining the situation with XT succinctly to everyone, the possible ramifications of supporting this fork far outweighed the pros. Though people have their respective gripes with It must be difficult to emotionally receive the collective hate from thousands and thousands of people. Especially when the hate is rarely justified, mainly manipulated. In my investigation much of it has no firm footing but rather a coordinated defamation of character similar to the Reddit hive mind. Investigate for yourself and you will see someone who has mainly tried to act in the best interest of the Bitcoin community. Coinbase threatened an attempt to "Control" the network using their power and were subsequently moderated. What they are doing now shows some possibilities:
* Clear motives which do NOT include the best interest of the bitcoin community
* A desire for revenge, since Brian feels scorned by what happened
* Attempting to do the same thing which landed them in this position to begin with, we know that banks invested in Coinbase. This doesn't mean you have to act like them
* An attempt to place someone in a position of power which they can manipulate
We need to be very truthful in our response as a collective community when companies like this, start acting like the very system we are trying to recreate.

Welcome to the fascinating world of Bitcoin, you made an astute decision in asking this community for advice. you presented well laid out questions which I will attempt to answer :)
* I would suggest you name the services you are considering, has a plethora of veteran users who are aware of every credible business in this space.
* If you source your goods/services within the bitcoin eco-system you are less impacted, should you need to use your BTC in exchange for USD. The price volatility may impact you positively or negatively (depending on the market conditions at the time of product purchase)
* I would highly recommend you consider a secure offline wallet to store your bitcoin, Trezor is the best I have seen or used thus far.
* If you operate from an Iphone/Android device you may use Breadwallet / Mycellium as a hot wallet, keep a nominal amount of bitcoin on there for spending purposes. The dynamic fees will ensure quick verification processes, hierarchical deterministic key creation will ensure your safety is not compromised while giving you ease of use.
* Good practices to improve your safety. Use wallets which utilise mnemonic code to generate deterministic keys (usually a 12+ string of random words) / never store your passwords on any electronic device unless it is secure. (Writing it down and storing it in a separate facility from the wallet/device is good practice.) *Create backups* **everytime** 
* Anything which offers an unrealistic ROI / most sites offering any financial/investment services without security in place e.g. SSL / HTTPS 
* Ultimately you have to be pro-active in your own research, study reviews/blogs/articles, consult respected forums/sub-reddits if you have any doubts. Don't let people pressure you into making investments without first feeling comfortable that you have reviewed all the necessary data, allowing you to make a well-informed decision. 
* Start with smaller amounts until you are comfortable with the technology
Good luck and welcome to :D

Any business model that has a clear depiction and explanation of where their profits originate and how the business owner/investor gets paid, usually ticks the box of "Not scam." 
When a business is elusive or uses hype words to mask where their PROFIT is generated for the individual user, I become wary immediately. Now bundle that with "Blockchain technology" and "Ultra hype words" without any clear explanations and you have the cluster fuck that is OneCoin :)

Emotions in any situation will actively play a role, whether the feelings are loving or destructive depends on the persons emotional condition. Ultimately it is up for the communicating participants to decide on how they actively use their will after they are affected.

Nick Szabo, a figure in our community we can all agree on and like. If anybody is fudding him they are just assholes.
The guy has done more in one facet of his life than most people have achieved in their entire lifetime.

If you are serious about storing your coins - may I suggest Trezor as the most secure option. 
* All open source 
* doesn't matter if your computer is infected with a virus etc
* keeps your bitcoin safely stored offline

Also using ECONOMIC understanding as some sort of pivot point for an argument which is TECHNICAL is nonsensical.
I  fully understand the scales and fundamentals of economics and governance models in this space, including the nuances and respective impacts. But I am not gonna tell fuckin how to code or what the most secure and plausible scaling options are, based on economic growth.
If we break the system trying to keep up with demand, there won't be a supply to offer. We cannot let the cart lead the horse here. 
It would be better if someone who has a deep economic understanding with a passable technical knowledge would sit down with the technical teams, explain where the growing pains are happening and how they are impacting businesses across multiple layers, then both parts of the ecosystem work in tandem to ensure the best outcome is always had.

This is not so much a laughing point, but a reflection point for those people who have this narrow minded us vs them position. Then some of you run around puking all over the other community when you are doing well then feel confused when their community laughs when you fall down, this attitude is a systemic disease in our respective communities.
If you think you won't face growing pains in Ethereum, as your demand grows. You are sadly mistaken.
Governance models and scalability is and will be the number one issue for a while until we can ALL integrate better solutions.

@_date: 2016-07-09 18:37:11
The mining hardware is a lot more efficient than it ever has been, difficulty does not jump like it once used to due to Moore's law.
I did some calculations on the initial setup of solar power to handle the required load of my mining operation, back then machines were clumsier and less efficient. Your setup is different as you already have the excess power and are simply utilising it through mining.
I would love updates and/or picture as you progress, good luck on your venture. Bare in mind the current block rewards have decreased when you do your calculations!

Create imcentivized systems to encourage the purchase through Bitcoin - (not sure what you sell) but buy a premium item in whatever field you are in and display it front and centre. Something every client has to ask
About, thing is. It's only for sale via Bitcoin :D
Also a sign that says "want to know

VIAbtc is a disgrace to this community. When all this dust settles. All of the people who have been duped for so long into believing they were supporting the right side. Will be deeply disappointed. Should the non-technical, greedy players in this space actually control some version of Bitcoin - Given enough time we will see it morph into Paypal 2.0 
But this is one argument I don't want to be right about, I just don't want to see it happen for the overall posterity of Bitcoin.

I can respect the view of wanting to help the network - this was one of my first goals as well. Just purchasing a single machine and putting it to solo mine to help decentralise things with no real expectation of finding anything is OK. If you want to have many baby dragons breathing hot fire throughout your estate - I can guide you as to which credible pools you use (some are automated which guarantee payouts etc) I have also
Been burned with pools and it took me a while to really get the true details of how mining worked. I stumbled onto a small pool which I was 85% of... Imagine how that made me smile after fighting in Ghash which was 10 Petahash at the time. A block was solved and rewarded in a few hours after joining. We got the lion share of the block and I thought to myself - holy shit I'm gonna make a mountain of BTC per day, after days... Weeks.. No payout, I realised things weren't adding up... I kept analysing the shares I crunched and realised it was totally random.. Long story short... If you want to mine to profit either have a big amount of hashing speed to do it solo or stick with an automated pool.

I understand completely how you feel, the allure of mining is massive especially if you are technically minded. The truth is it has become extremely difficult to make any kind of profit at the current difficulty. The hash rate in the network is excessive and the price is low which makes for a really bad match. If you have a massive amount of capital and want to make it work it is still achievable.  Having said that, if you are new I recommend just direct acquisition of Bitcoin itself at this stage, the price is reasonable and we are on their cusp of moore's law I believe.
