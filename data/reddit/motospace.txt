There are huge problems with Bitcoin that will only be fixed by applying some kind of Visa style layer on top of it, thus creating all the same problems the current banking system already has.

I'm guessing a big sell of and some panic selling surrounding it, will just have to wait and see if it causes a larger 'landslide' or if it remains isolated.

I think the 'typical bubble' graph better represents the cycle of human greed and fear far more accurately than it represents economy.

You haven't lost a penny until you sell for less than you paid.

Thanks for this post, it helped ground me and realize I need to calm down and prepare myself financially.
I found an old USB stick a few weeks ago with WALLET.DAT written on it, sure enough there was 65000 bitcoins sitting in that wallet. I had kinda been following the price rise but since they where practically worthless when I mined them years ago, I'd assumed that I only had a few.
Only joking I've watched the entire Bitcoin process absent mindedly since 2010 ignoring it and now I'm regretting it with a grand total of 9 BTC from early 2011 that I decided to buy which I intend to keep long term.

Isn't this basically already available with Barclays PingIt?
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:37:44
Oh yeah, me too! I have confidence in the long term success of Bitcoin, so a drop of any amount is just a bonus for me.
@_date: 2013-03-01 11:39:53
I agree though, of course we all want Bitcoin to set solid foundations in actual retail and everyday use. However when a new investor gets demonized because they aren't starting up some wholesome Bitcoin business to support everyone elses investments, it makes me wonder if the people demonizing them truly have the long term success of Bitcoin in their mind, or just the stability of their own investments in mind.

Peoples opinions in this subreddit are about as unpredictable and volatile as the value of BTC, so I think it fits well.

I'm betting on a night club. People are stubborn about withdrawal fees on ATMs here, the only way they could dream of charging £5 is in a club where everyone is far too pissed to think.

They are usually accounting for value fluctuation in their favor, so taking the average low point to make sure they don't loose too much money.

I said this last time too! The attacks don't seem to fit the profile of someone who is only interested in profiting from day trading...
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:32:05
It hasn't already? The entire community is going to implode if people continue patting eachothers backs as hard as they are doing and talking about how we are all gonna become overnight billionaires, pity thy who cast doubt upon our perfect, flawless technology!
I don't mind the optimism but it is getting to the point of obvious frantic self assurance and anxiety-driven paranoia, if we keep saying the price willl go **UP UP AND UP** then it will **never** go down! I won't be forced into bankruptcy because i got pulled into the hype and spent my entire student loan and family savings on Bitcoins!! **UP UPP!!! KILL THE BEARS!!!!**
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:34:35
But... but I bought my deluxe latte from my local hipster coffee shop **with Bitcoins** last week! Widespread adoption is already here!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:05:44
This is pretty stupid. You can't just put an order in for every single Bitcoin at the current ask price, you have to buy them incrementally, if the ask price is $100, that doesn't mean every single Bitcoin is for sale at $100, it just means that it the lowest price some people are selling for. So if someone started buying all the coins, they would have to pay ever increasing amounts for them, then as the price being paid for these coins visibly increased, people would increase their prices even further until the buyer ran out of money.

I think you are confusing the "hugeness" of a third party exchanging your bitcoins for money, then sending the money to Amazon with the actual hugeness of Amazon making a massive statement of confidence in Bitcoin by directly accepting them.

I was 99% expecting this comic to end in sex.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:07:59
I think the amount of pain has a direct correlation to how much the person has invested in BTC right now!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:15:47
Won't the sellers just refuse to post orders and refund?
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:18:55
Those are bots.

Whyyyy? Who is gaining from this DDOS? It isn't even going to affect anything in the long run.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:50:00
There's always someone with the same plan willing to buy in $1 more than you, that's the reason it doesn't drop more than $5-$10 at a time.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:30:45
Haha, that Proudhon guy is a real character.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:54:38
We're all kicking ourselves bro, we all are. Look at it this way: at least you didn't buy them then sell at a loss like some people did.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:15:26
In his defense... yeah we are incapable of doing that at the moment.
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:58:28
Fuuuuuuuuucckkkk! That would suck.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:39:35
Nobody has lost anything until they sell for less than they bought in at.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:59:32
Curious as to why they linked it to one guy giving away Bitcoins on reddit?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:52:49
Price on Bitstamp is $160!!
@_date: 2013-03-01 10:20:37


Of course it is, because you have invested in Bitcoins too and don't want them to become unstable. Sorry but it is really obvious that your 'desire' for Bitcoins to be more stable is selfishly related to your own investments, so don't put the OP down for doing the same thing as you.
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:04:56
It sounds strange but me and my boyfriend (and a growing group of our friends) also do this.
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:16:44
Lots of bots kicking in with inflated micro buys. I'm pretty happy right now, I was seconds from clicking 'Buy' on 35BTC.
