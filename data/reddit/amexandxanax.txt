Um what? Why would it ever reach a critical mass if it was even possible to "do something about it"?
The entire value of the concept is that **nobody can do anything about it**, and we can throw your comment in the trash can with the rest of the loophole-riddled hypotheticals.
But your plea for "customer service" ... I have to say, you're the first person I've ever found who will **miss** customer service from financial institutions in the slightest...
Blockchain is the **ultimate** customer service. That is one huge part of the concept.
I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the concepts (not the current market landscape, on which you are clearly knowledgeable) of blockchain and how it can represent a fundamental shift in currency and transactions like you read about in AP Human Geography.
Not gonna happen overnight. People were not excited about putting their credit cards on the internet in 1998 because it added another abstraction layer of technology that nobody understood at the time. There were speedbumps. All of them were corporate-related, hacking-related, fraud-related... Blockchain is the next step in all of these areas. The technology is preventing itself from becoming a bubble. But it's important to understand that **that is part and parcel with the concept** and how it is value-driven unlike fiat.
 I can preach all day but I really, really, for your own good, think you should really hammer down your thoughts on the concepts...

Are you really asking what kind of bubbles the Fed rate can create after 2007 and the "quantitative easing" since then

Ehmmm yes. That's exactly what it means. USD is the king currency at this time. Are you living on Earth?

Hear me out on a different approach, guy...
Is Ethereum the iPhone of crypto, and is Bitcoin the Android? I think so. Because in the long-term (which is what you are talking about, and it's what I believe truly matters as this market expands into applications we haven't yet realized)... Ethereum is still a walled garden! Bitcoin is Old Reliable. It's Android/Windows/Linux-esque. Ethereum is like the App Store.
Both have their qualities. People use Android/Windows/Linux even though Apple is by far the biggest from a market cap standpoint.
Step back... and think, Can society really go from this system to crypto system in one year? Two years? Five years? Ten years? Sure, a few countries with progressive monetary policy will adopt crypto. We will see huge gains in blockchain. But a NATION'S MONEY, a BANK'S MONEY, money that's designated for high-security SAFEKEEPING, money that's transferred with completely PRIVATE &amp; ANONYMOUS data, money that is meant to be transferred IMMEDIATELY for point-of-sale, ... Then of course the tech innovations on top of the currency itself... DYOR
But I hope you don't invest like this comment!

Throw that recipe in the trash... I guess everyone has to realize the big picture on their own.

Yeah he is clearly nitpicking when he says "actually anything close" when it's pretty close and it's obviously bigger than both, and it has lasted for quite a while now despite post-Jobs
Anyway, we're all really nitpicking now when we talk about price changes here and there relative to this day in 2019... but we know that already

They should give it a new name. Ethereum sounds new and futuristic and valuable, like a rare physical resource; Bitcoin sounds like a little bit of pocketchange! Who wants pocketchange when they can have moon rocks???
