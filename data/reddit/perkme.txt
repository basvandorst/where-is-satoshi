Eh..if they're both going down I would still rather hold a currency I can take out of the country without restrictions.

You are looking for coinspy.io

I believe it means that all your wallet's addresses are derived from a single string of words from a list. Therefore, by backing up that list, you can regenerate the addresses you've used if you ever weren't able to access your wallet via the website.

Looks slick, but I'll wait till I see something in hand. I've seen too much vaporware in the bitcoin space

Yeah, sure you can do whatever you want in the software you develop. luke-jr didn't develop gentoo though, he's just a maintainer. So he may have made contributions in part, but he has no right to include those type of ideological things as if the whole thing is solely his creation.

It's not really a huge problem, but it is an issue. It's basically one douche with the ability to include certain things in the software he helps maintain. He made the executive decision that certain transactions should not be propagated by nodes, and has made the bitcoin client reject these transactions by default.
This goes against the neutrality of bitcoin. who decides what constitutes 'spam' and what is a worthy transaction? Where do we draw the line?

Are you a large, recognized charity? If so, at least give us some information.

Fuck Avon.

Why would anyone by Doge from an atm. Lol...what would they do with it? Litecoin even...what stores take ltc?
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:10:31
Bitcoinity is using mBTC.   
   
1 bitcoin = 1000 mBTC, 1mBTC = 1000 bits, 1bit = 100 satoshi. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:21:06
Aha, thank you for the clarification.

Gentoo is a Linux distro; just another type of linux some people prefer to run. Examples of other distros are Fedora, Arch, Debian(like Ubuntu), [etc.](

If that's the case, then why enable the blacklisting by default? If the nature of bitcoin is to let people make their own choice to reach a majority consensus among the group, then simply provide them the means to do so.
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:03:43
It depends. If you lost your private key, there would be no way for them to prove you weren't lying. If your private key was stolen and used to sweep the funds out of the wallet, they could see that transaction occur; but again, they can't tell if you're lying, since you could have just sent the funds to a different unused address still under your control

Fuck faucets. Don't waste your time giving people ad revenue in exchange for *fractions of a penny*

Ah, sticky situation. In this case, I believe a little *privatized justice* is in order.

Have you asked any shops or business owners about it yourself? Don't expect companies to step in and take care of everything...you can do what you're asking them to do by yourself while they worry about things the rest of us wouldn't have access to. Like meetings with the Treasury and lobbying politicians. Everybody has a meaningful role to play.
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:16:47
You make some good points, and I think I agree with you. I think its more about usability than asthetics. I guess I just find myself longing for more in bitcointalk...but we all know how it works with the all-powerful Thermos.
I'll have to checkout that alternative you suggested, I hadn't heard of that previously
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:47:48
Perhaps Thermos is finally bringing the BRAND NEW FORUM (coded from scratch) online!!!
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:01:17
Is that address the ransom address? Just get your own wallet somewhere like rushwallet.com and have it sent there, then use your own wallet to send to ransom
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:54:03
Sorry man, but you're a dumbass. Bitcoin isn't the get rich quick scheme you thought it was. It doesn't exist to make greedy people like you money.
This is why I love huge price drops. It does a pretty good job of shaking out all the people who just got in it for the money. This thread is just more evidence of that fact.
Do you always do what people tell you to do? Why don't you go buy some PayCoin? Are you telling us that you bought btc, because some people on the internet told you to...then, months later you decide to research the history of btc? LOL! You should have researched all that before you dropped *any* significant amount of money into *anything*, online or in real life.
You know what they say...a fool and his money are soon parted. And you, my friend, are quite a fool.
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:19:03
Lol, you know, I'm starting to feel that way too. The homepage is giving me anxiety...I'd prefer a more linear, vertical layout. I guess I just needed to vent about the lack of innovation on bitcointalk, perhaps hashtalk is not the ideal standard of comparison

Nice ref link... :/
[NitrogenSports.eu]( (non-ref) is great though, been using them since last year with no issues whatsoever

Ross gets punished brutally for an arguably lesser crime, while nobody has been arrested for the crimes peretrated by the big banks. They just pay the goverment a small percentage of their profits.

Do you live in Somalia? Why have you not told the police that your friend admitted to the theft?
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:28:50
no, you dont need 'bitcoin' but you do need some sort of incentive mechanism if it's to be decentralized and 'normal' people are allowed to mine blocks
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:40:20
So were the funds sent originally from DarkWallet? In the transaction you linked, which of the sending address are yours? And I'm guessing you had mixing enabled then, since you mentioned the other output address as not being yours?
Go to your pocket then to the Addresses tab, and then click 'All' to be sure all addresses (unused/mixing/used) are being shown
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:45:08

Not gonna happen. Surely he would if he could. is not a scammer or theif, despite popular opinion
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:57:35
Hm, can you post one of the addresses? Either the one you sent the funds from or the one that received them
@_date: 2015-04-01 18:46:28
It sent only part of the transaction? Perhaps it's not displaying in the app properly, did you check the address on a block explorer to verify?
@_date: 2015-04-01 18:12:24
Did you donate to help fund their development? Or are you just complaining that their free, alpha software isn't up to your standards? How did you loose $20?
