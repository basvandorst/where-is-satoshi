Thanks, you're awesome!
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:22:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:28:50
You download it, sign-in, and you get bitcoin! I'll edit the post and clarify. thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:30:02
Thanks! We appreciate the support!
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:05:49
We have your email, we will send it there. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:40:52
We use coinbase to send out the btc. If you don't have a wallet, the email will prompt you to sign up for coinbase. I am pretty sure you can transfer it anywhere you want...
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:52:09
No, we will send you an email. It might take a bit. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:01:30
No, but you will probably have to create an account. But you can send it back to your main coinbase account if you want it all in one place. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:52:16
Thanks for signing up!  
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:36:27
Hi, you don't have to log in to coinbase through our browser to collect you bitcoin. You will receive it by email. We just have a coinbase app. We want to do tighter integration with coinbase (like we did with pandora) and we are open to any ideas you might have!
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:21:02
Maybe next time! 8-)
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:26:47
Awesome! Welcome to the community! We will make sure you get your bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:44:22
No, we will email you! It might take a bit...
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:30:31
Thanks! Really great feedback. I like the idea of dragging icons and being able to adjust the dock size. Over the next couple months we are switching to a new platform that will make our interface a lot faster!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:03:40
Thanks! Right click on things, search through our marketplace, and try and break stuff! We are dedicated to improving our product. 
And yes, i will send out the btc manually. Chances are I will eventually get backed up but I'll do my best. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:19:14
Nope! Still giving out btc! You will get an email eventually. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:16:15
I think mostly everyone will get it today or tomorrow. If you fell through the cracks email us!
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:47:11
Hi, we will send you bitcoin shortly! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:07:55
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:42:00
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:51:55
YUP! Thanks and glad you like it!
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:35:20
Its coming. I'll show you a little secret. It might break some things because we technically have not released it yet. but try cntrl shift 2 or 3. you can move the windows around in split screen. also try control tilda once you are in the mode. like i said that is a beta feature and it may break things. hit cntrl shift 1 to go back into normal mode, and restart the browser.
when we implement it for real, you will right click to open in split screen. enjoy!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:05:42
Thanks! Yes, I am sending out the bitcoin, you should get it shortly. In the meanwhile, add some apps to your dock!
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:54:51
sorry we are behind we will email you!
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:21:21
Thank you!!!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:32:44
No! Just catching up. My fingers hurt!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:06:15
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:34:05
Hi,things crashed yesterday and our list got kind of screwed up. We have given out a ton of btc and are still working on redeeming everyone. send us an email at contact from the email you signed up with and we will send you some btc asap. Thanks and we apologize! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:07:36
We do not steal bitcoins. We are not thieves! We are just some dudes that made a web browser. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:44:04
Thank you! We really appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:38:09
Hi, you have to install! Thank you! if you miss the 8pm deadline email contact and i will send you some!
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:38:36
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:18:09
How much did it send you?
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:03:08
lol, its coming, we are just backed up! Hope you enjoy Cycle!
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:25:54
Try cntrl-tab. Its still an experimental feature. Adding the 5-10 apps you use everyday really helps the browser become worth it because it organizes everything by app. For example, if you use quora all your quora tabs will be under that icon. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:24:27
Guys, I am doing this MANUALLY. give me a sec, we will get to you. KJGD23987 email me and ill take care of ya
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:37:11
Hey guys, thank you for your support! It looks like coinbase is down for the time being! Keep signing up and we will redeem as long as it is before 8pm pst! We are going to start giving out random amounts for the last run. Some small, and some BIG!
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:27:24
Hi, i am sending them out manually, so it might take a bit. Hope you enjoy the browser!@
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:06:04
Sorry i am doing this manually because I am dumb. Its coming!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:41:12
You can sign up with any email, and we will send it there via coinbase. You can always create a coinbase account with that email and send it back to your main account. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:10:46
A HUGE thank you to the bitcoin/reddit community for helping us with our soft launch! We love all of you guys. Please look out for us in the future, we will be releasing some really cool stuff. 
Side note: Any ideas for adding bitcoin functionality to our browser/coinbase app?
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:52:03
we will email it to you. thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:25:50
You are not too late! 
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:20:38
Thanks! Our CTO provided some security detail further up in the thread. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:49:46
Thank you!!
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:14:04
Yes! we are just backed up. we are sending it out asap!
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:35:49
Thank you! Glad you enjoy it!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:40:14
Hi, we support linux, mac, and windows for the time being. We are coming out with an android tablet app very very soon! FAQ is also coming soon. Sorry for the confusion! 
On a side note, we sync across all the devices we support. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:31:28
That is a good question. I am not sure. Since it is all through coinbase I am sure you will eventually get it one way or another. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:40:52
In some countries that will buy you a steak dinner and an ak-47
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:38:47
Thank you for posting that. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:10:31
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:25:05
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:13:51
Android tablet app is coming out soon with full syncing!
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:52:53
It is totally voluntary. We give out random amounts of btc, some get more, some get less. We worked really hard on this project and the last thing want to do is screw over our users. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:07:27
I think you're onto something...
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:55:03
Hi, we are a real company. Here is the linkedin and twitter of our ceo:
 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:05:46
Hi, sorry we are just backed up and dealing with bugs. we will send you the btc asap! it might take a bit though...
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:42:22
Thanks and yes!
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:56:46
Glad to hear you find it interesting! We will look into why it crashed the first time. It might of just auto updated...
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:04:38
You are awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:26:13
Yes! We will email it to you!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:58:36
Thanks! We are releasing some awesome stuff soon!
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:46:37
We are not stealing your wallet. We are a real business in Silicon Valley with a reputation to protect. We were in the Boost VC accelerator and our investors and advisors include Scott McNealy and Adam Draper (investor in coinbase). Chrome and IE have an advantage because they have hardware distribution. This is why they have not innovated on the browser UI. We are creating a fun incentive for people to download and helping the btc community. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:27:50
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:50:04
It's coming! we are a bit backed up...
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:54:36
You have not been duped. We are working our way down the list.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:20:13
Thank you! It doesnt have to be the same email, you can always transfer it later. But I think it makes you create a new account.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:10:18
Hi, yes! It may take a while, but you will be redeemed! 
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:45:10
We are giving out random amounts. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:56:53
Yes, I think so. I am sending it out through coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:50:59
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:58:01
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:56:18
Hey, I am working on it! I am sending them out manually lol 
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:47:34
Stuff is breaking right now and gmail is not happy lol. We are working on it!
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:43:06
Thanks! I have been trying to respond as quickly as possible!
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:55:52
Hi and thank you! Hopefully a couple hours max. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:37:49
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:09:42
It will be sent by email!
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:09:26
Thank you! We will send you an email. I am doing this manually with nothing but 5 hour energy to keep me going. lol
Glad you added coinbase! We want to add some integrated funcitonality like we did with pandora. Let us know what would be interesting. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:06:34
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:23:49
Thank you for the kind words, we really appreciate your support!
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:49:44
Windows: We provide an "Uninstall Cycle" program for Windows in your Start Menu. We haven't yet put an entry in the system "Programs" where typical administration is, and I apologize for that. That will be remedied in a future release.
Ubuntu: apt-get remove cycle-browser
Fedora: yum erase cycle-browser
Mac OSX: Drag the icon to the Trash
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:06:31
Thanks for downloading! We really go out of our way not to change people's behavior, while still providing a better UI for the web. For example, cntrl-t is still the same if you want to open a new pane/tab and search. Hope you stick with it, we will be releasing a lot of cool stuff soon!
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:38:21
Thanks! email me at contact
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:07:59
Awesome. It is really great once you get a custom workflow set up!
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:26:38
We are releasing for the android tablet market before christmas. It will sync across desktop and tablet! No configuration necessary. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:47:42
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:42:04
Not that long. I am a fast clicker. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:06:04
Thanks! We really do appreciate feedback, both good and bad. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:50:35
Yes, but we provide tab organization, syncing, and deeper integration with your apps. Add pandora and you will see what I mean!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:01:15
ATTENTION: Due to overwhelming demand, we are cutting off at 6pm instead of 8pm PST. If you sign up between 6-8pm we will pick one or two of you to recieve a much larger chunk of coin! Its just easier for us and we want to catch up with all the people who signed up earlier.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:39:23
email contact
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:47:53
Hey Guys, 
We really hope you enjoy Cycle. If you received bitcoin already, feel free to upvote/comment. We don't want people thinking this is some kind of scam. We would never do that to our fellow bitcoiners! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:58:52
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:47:06
Yes, we are releasing that in a week or so! Thats why we havn't done press. Luckily the btc folk are pretty savvy!
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:14:17
We are currently working on releasing Cycle for the android tablet market. We are really excited about it! it syncs from computer to computer and computer tablet without any configuration. We designed it from the ground up to work with keyboard/mouse and touchscreens of all sizes. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:12:29
Thank you! Definitely check out the pandora integration. It is one of our new features!
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:02:49
We are still giving out bitcoin! Glad that you like Cycle!!!
ATTENTION: We are backed up, you will get your BTC, be patient!
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:58:52
Hi, I have been aware of the missing feature. We had a couple of users in the past who loved those mouse buttons. We are working on it but it might be a couple months down the road! Its one of those seemingly simple things that takes some elbow grease to fix
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:49:30
It is random. Today so far i have given out 1 cent up to 8 dollars. Imagine how much that fractional could be worth one day! ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:41:44
Thanks! We are working like crazy to push releases every week. We don't like to spam our users so definitely keep using the product and keep an eye on us!
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:59:13
It is random. Some people will get up to $8 usd. Most will get ~.001 btc. Besides, if bitcoin becomes as big as the gold market, your fractional will be worth quite a bit. This is a way for people to check out a browser that might help them, and for more people to get their hands on bitcoin to grow the community.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:26:14
No, we just raised a tiny bit of seed money. It took us a very long time to build our minimum viable product. We are starting to get a bit of a cult following, so maybe we will raise another round soon!
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:30:47
The only time that happened to me is when I was not connected to the Internet. Our CTO will investigate it and get back to you!
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:46:02
Thanks for the feedback. We are working on a tutorial that should come out pretty soon. Once you get things set up it is a pretty efficient workflow. But there is tons of room for improvement!
