True. The information shared by a cult is true. Any system devoted to its way of thinking is by definition a cult. Attempting to slander a set of principles or understanding by calling it a cult in negative KKK connotation is weak a pathetic. I don’t think that was what you intended so I will remain naive in agreeing with your statement. Sure glad he isn’t the founder and believes in the technology in a way that he helps others understand. Glad there isn’t an organized religion associated with any type of malice towards any individual. Thankfully the technology can put the power of trade for everyone in the world and not have to pay the bankers to do it. Ever try to send money or exchange it in another country?

Oh man, agree x2. Future really isn’t dependent on the individual though it’s all about the 3-4 billion without bank access. We just have the fortune to be in as early as we are.
 confusion and FUD (fear uncertainty doubt) and FOMO (fear of missing out) is a crazy ordeal a lot of fear is always seizing. I’m sure we may see a bigger crazier dip but I’m not holding out for that. I’m all in and commend anyone with the cajones to jump in at any point. No guarantees in this market or that anything will be in existence tomorrow...that’s what makes it so intense. Thanks for joining the team! PM me any time!

Hopefully we can have an mutual agreement for the pursuit of the common good and not try to push one's understanding, rather have the information do the talking. Keep in mind I am in pursuit of the common good, the implementation of the most disruptive technologies introduced in our lifetimes, Bitcoin. Let limit it to each piece versus playing the he said, she said and come to a state of clarity. 
Okay let's start with that piece by piece:
1. "Blockchain is only useful if it is decentralized and trust-less."
The pursuit of blockchain is to provide the information for all, hence the use of "decentralized" here. None one person has complete control of the information. The use of blockchain has far reaching apps beyond fiat. To limit it to being trust-less is denying the fact that it is the "god-protocol" contract capability where no favoritism occurs. I hope that blockchain is NOT limited to only being "trust-less" but rather a state of infallibility aka GOD is perfect! 
"SQL works better for centralized trusted applications which Ripple is." 
The SQL query language is a system of organized data in tables. A payment coin that has the potential to cut-out the middle man is genius and you disagree. Great. Lets take excitement of this individual investing in his child! 
While the purpose of this is not to "shill" ripple I will avoid further comment. If you wish to continue this conversation, let us discuss in off the Bitcoin reddit! I will rather focus on Bitcoin. Let's not waste time talking about any other coin. You are right in that I shouldn't talk about another coin on Bitcoin, that was a poor move on my part. I apologize. 
You're confusion blockchain 'buzzwords' with practical blockchain application."
Lets come to a point of clarity on what the blockchain is in simple terms it is a public "distributed ledger".
If you truly want to help people not be uniformed, go on brother show me the bitcoin! I will up vote all your comments.
Let's part ways on the simpleness of how awesome it was that this gentlemen chose to invest in his daughter by purchasing a bitcoin. That is great. Bitcoin has a capacity to revolutionize the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:52:52
Got ya, good call.
How do we stop the confusion?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:17:07
Don’t worry about that...I’ve tried to talk about it and have been hushed...not that I care I just know it’s going to be huge!
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:32:13
So not worried about price, segwit2x will help reduce transaction fees. Just got to make sure ya got your btc in a place where you will get the benefit and not have the exchange rip someone off...
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:15:33
Woohoo! Bitcoin mining and electrical uses is opening the door for providing more power and energy to the parts of the worlds that don’t have enough power.

That’s exactly what I’m asking the community...
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:11:17
Heard its about 5 year deal
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:40:31
Don’t worry when it hits 12,500 you will ask yourself why didn’t ya buy more and then end up buying at 13,200, then it will drop to 11,900 and you will be asking why didn’t I wait and then it will hit 15,000 and you will say I’m not gonna buy Now and then it will hit 17,500 and so the cycle continues to crazy ATH and then precipitous drops!!!
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:25:17
So what you’re really trying to say is...
&lt;wait for it&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:36:01

Don’t the Ver-it’s try to rip down BTC from the inside or do the openly attach it? Gee wiz!
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:01:54
I’m a bitcoin believer, more of blockchain resolutions to real world issues. I hope BTC can somehow survive (it will, just got to watch how it's done) simultaneously with Forks and be used on a wider scale (meant to be that Forks should be a stable fixed price asset and used for transaction purposes is the only future I see with it) [edit for clarification]. Funny things are about %s...is that ya can skew them any way ya want. The quote of 61% being held from circulation is as of May 26, 2017. Great info. Thanks. I agree with that and yes it is true.
What I do know is blockchain was created to disrupt and revolutionize the old way of doing things. Can you say with certainty BTC will be here in 18 years? I have no crystal ball.
Blockchain is here to stay. Ripple solves the issue of national payments. (Emphasis on period) what major problem does BTC resolve? It is the first one in the door, and I own it. It’s awesome.
Are you 100% all in BTC? I think a lot of these cryptos will fade or rather be absorbed by Bitcoin for sure as the devs modify it with each beat of the blockchain. 
Great insight on already widely known fact on _ _ _ (this is about BTC). It’s the application of blockchain and what ripple solves.
Man stop the ridicule and mockery! That only pushes people away! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:04:30

Agreed, it’s a total scam, the fees for which your are discussing for sure is an issue. Once lightening network is fully implemented, the fees will decrease substantially to almost nothing!
At first like you said it will cause a lot of shift to alt coins, but in the end BTC will be the one standing superior to others...

Great summary! I would like to emphasize, “High volatility appeals to traders but not to serious investors such as 401ks, indexes and ETFs”...
My 401k back in 2007-2008 transition went to a 101k and hasn’t come close to a rebound yet (hence I cashed out and went into crypto)...
Indexes and ETFs: what about GBTC Bitcoin Trust? Was trading at 400-600 about 3 months ago? BTSC, BSTC, BITCF, ...
It’s here the waking of Wall Street  is upon us, when the official light turns on, who knows.
Solid prediction on 100k, it’s only a matter of time HODL and don’t let the FUD drive your decision.

Agreed we are that someone not accepting BTC as payment can hurt the use with that one company. Maybe a shill on VTG?
Was this given to provide information?
Here is what I know, Steam is looking at option of using Dash, LTC, ETH, and Iota. It was cited also in an article that “prominent BCH supporter and bitcoin.com CEO saw the announcement as an opportunity to increase Bitcoin Cash’s adoption, and as such publicly invited the company to accept the cryptocurrency” (cryptocoinsnews.com) 
Just want to be clear if you are attempting to show that it is a trail of BCH as a substitute or to show that it will not be selected and fall?
Just want to put everything in order. It’s simple yea for bch or nay watch it fall? If you choose to not answer I will take it that you are a supporter of BCH. Just want to interpret correctly...

Bottom line a denigrating comment to provoke one to offense, the error lies with the one who was offended when none was intended. The error is on me.
Slamming bitcoin by saying it is going to hurt it does not improve knowledge about the topic. Please state the reason foe a claim with intelligible reasoning next time. 
Please read “Mastering Bitcoin”, “Blockchain Revolution”, or the “Internet of Money”. 
White papers and just putting money in something doesn’t show any skill. Took me a little while to see, but I strongly recommend those books... 
Good luck to you in Bitcoin investments!

Just a thought:
How many of the gold investors hold it in their hands? Do they even look at it? Is it a fictitious thing that we imagine under the blanket of security that it is "recession proof" and "holds its value"? We may tell ourselves, "If I had to I could take it out." That in itself is interesting, who will deliver it to us? How could we get pounds of gold? I have purchased some raw metals from jmbuillion, but I really think that may be one of the few ways to purchase raw gold. Any insight would be great just been pondering...

How do the ""regulate" Bitcoin exchanges if it's untraceable. If a terrorist is seeking a way to accomplish his deceit do we really think a regulation will help decrease them acting?

So here's the scoop with our good old friend IRS:
Question if the IRS recognizes it as a form of currency that is volatile, what prevents one from saying oh it was valued at this at time of sale but now it's worth 2 of those. Treating it as property would entail you do or do not have to pay capital gains taxes? Wouldn't you only have to pay taxes on the increase at the time of conversion, much like a 401k?
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:53:54
Agreed we are in the sales boat. Knew I couldn't be the only one. That's right about where I have started as well jut a little off the top will hopefully add up.

Valid assessment.

Great question and there are a lot of "correction theorists" out there. Do you think it was ever a "bad time to get into apply prior to 2010? 
The goal is to look long. No way to tell the future. Just check out Newton's 3rd law of thermodynamics. Only I add to the end ...will go up higher!

@_date: 2017-08-17 06:36:11
Bitcoin has got me thinking way more globally...in a zen-ist way we are going to be trading with many people that have NEVER had any type of interaction in the free market. 39% of the world doesn't even have a bank account, 775 million can't even read, and we think we can just welcome them in to a new world without first leading by example? Granted the reporter has to sell magazines and finance journalism has to write stuff to be read. It's a shame that confrontation and fear is what sells the current population. I know we all do it and I am just as much at fault but we got to change somewhere. Why not start with ourselves? Call me on it anytime.

Nice!!! That is a great heads up. Do you have a website with that story?
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:50:27
What I really want to know and understand is the connection with Bitcoin to ETH and the need for bookkeeping. That is amazing. Will be nice not to have to carry around my wallet and a ledger instead!
Do you know how the ledger system will interface for trading amongst different holders as a currency? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:08:23
Legit to defame the obviously correct path! Is that why we should spend all of our money instead of putting it in the bank?
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:33:47
Solid answers thank you my friend! I look forward to learning more from you.
I first invested in ETH and still am because it acts as a ledger, keeping track of everything (so my understanding goes). I am still somewhat invested in ETH and have joined Bitcoin after watching the 2 to 3 to 4 freight train. 
I found this video and it is pretty awesome!

From day trading to going long and going short on stocks to small returns on ebbs and flows of gold I am starting to see so much more potential in Bitcoin, ETH, mining, and all the multidimensional factors offered this is the real deal.

It's simple math, how would Americans trade? How do Chinese trade? Got to look at countries with most purchasing power...China has just surpassed America...but it's about GDP at this point...."The five nations with the highest GDP in market exchange terms are the U.S., China, India, Japan and Germany." Those are the countries we aught to look at...not sure where you are from but China pulled out. We can call names or find the cause and effect, to hopefully capitalize on it before it's to late...

Absolutely correct it's just the Newton's 1st law in action with trading. Right now their is a lot of FUD out their and it will just walk up slower to 4500, once it closes over 4600. It will repeat and do the same at 5 and on to 5500. It will just be going like crazy and then comes the correction back to sub 4. It's cyclical...people need to know it will most definitely bounce to get their and not be so quick to abandon their positions. Just get on the boat!!!

Correct, pedant I was. 
We do provide service for fiat every day multiple times through every day. Never have I used gold directly in a single transaction, always been fiat.
I think they medium through exchange occurs against the value of gold is fading and will change, if its in the next 60 years or not who knows. As society is progressing and the perception of “the system” has to evolve. Does it call for crypto, not sure. It sure is an interesting one as more details surface.

@_date: 2017-09-07 19:57:23
How much do you have in crypto?
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:09:30
1. Money will only show in gdax or coin base. It is segregated because you can’t place 2 trades at same time. It’s a lot more secure.
2. The bitcoin purchased will remain in which ever platform you bought it with (either gdax or coinbase)
Careful with purchasing on coinbase. It may feel more secure but that’s because you are paying a premium for it.
After you have purchased you can keep it on the market (coinbase or gdax) or put it in to a wallet. I do not like sending/receiving with coinbase because it costs a silly fee. 
If you want to learn how to send receive I am more than willing to help with that. I just did a similar thing for a friend...
Good luck and it is for sure a prime time out there!

Touché...their are a lot of new investors coming in by a ridiculous amount. China for sure played a hiccup, but this is a war against centralization and taking our money. Last thing I want is to bow to a communistic community, the mean well but not meant for me.
As with our different approach to how to get past china and price posting, the market is cyclical we agree. 
On today's headlines we will be hearing from the fed in America and seeing home sales. China moved the day to the end of October but as far as being set in stone I have not heard other than speculation. NEO and alt coin seems to be making some interesting moves at the moment. 
The other world consumers and investors are hoping to make some cash and banking on the future. 
A lot of what I have found about the presumed October 31st shut down date is very unofficial. Not sure I buy the whole "we're out", then "oh we have to wait until October 31st"...kind of getting whiplash. Maybe you have read something more than a tweet, Bitcoin enthusiast???
