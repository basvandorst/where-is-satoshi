How is this getting upvoted? OP don't listen to this guy at all. Either your in or your out. What's the point of half-assing anything? If you believe that Bitcoin is going up in value in the future, then why wouldn't you put all your money into it? How else are you supposed to ever make money if you keep avoiding ever single little risk. No risk no reward. Why is playing it safe always being recommended and praised as the most viable option? DUDE, grow some balls. Just do it. Or don't. How does putting $500 solve anything? It just makes you a pussy and unable to commit. You have to be bold in life to achieve fantastic results. Look at all these morons posting, This, Exactly This, a bunch of sheeple. OP, don't be like them. Your first gut intuition was right, Bitcoin is an excellent investment. YES IT IS RISKY. But that is exactly why there is a chance you can make a lot of money with it very fast. If bitcoin weren't so risky and it was more of a "sure" thing the upside would barely exist at all. I mean look at investing money into your own savings account, that's a sure thing and you thats why you get 1% interest a year.
I am personally invested in Bitcoin and the upside it has is huge. Take that $5000, trust your feelings, and you will know what to do. Don't ask other random uninvested reddit sheeple there stupid opinions anyway. Be a man, what does your heart, brain, soul tell you to do? What is the first feeling you get? Then either go all in or not at all.
Good luck.
