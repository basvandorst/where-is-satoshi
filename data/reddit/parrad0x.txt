Damn this bubble is big. Its almost like... its gaining legitimacy as a currency and as people put more trust in it, the value rises. No? Still A bubble? Ok...

For all the noobs who just bought using Coinbase: Download a trustworthy wallet on to your computer or smartphone to store your bitcoin. Don’t keep it on Coinbase, you do not own it until it’s in a separate wallet. 
For those with iPhones I highly recommend Bread as a wallet app. It’s secure and simple for noobs to use.

Yeah I think currency might have been the wrong word. I see Bitcoin as a digital gold/silver. I don’t think you will ever spend bitcoin on common goods and services. I think it is going to correct too. But I do think it has proven itself for what it is, and people still doubting its legitimacy may not understand its value. But yes, I can agree there’s no way in hell it goes up and up and up with out some sort of correction.
