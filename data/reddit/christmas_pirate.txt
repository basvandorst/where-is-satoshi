If only. A checking account is an account you can withdraw from more than 3 times a month (for my bank that is the limit to the number of times you can withdraw from a savings account without a fee). No interest, no free checks, just unlimited withdraws a month and I have to keep $1500 in it or have a paycheck of over $250 deposited into once a billing period (month) it or there's a fee.

I have a bank that is particularly well know for their outrageous fee structure to the point where they were told by the government they had to stop, but minimum balances/monthly deposits/withdrawal limits are pretty standard practice.  There's also withdrawal limits of $500 a day from their atms (you can request more temporarily, but they always reset it even though they told me they wouldnt) and the interest rate on that savings account is about 1%. The best part (which is now illegal) was if you made a deposit and several withdrawals on the same day, the withdrawals were processed first so even if at the end of the day there was a positive balance, they still charged you an overdraft fee.

And you will always get them, maybe not the nigerian one, but a scam that is obvious.  The thing is while 99.99% of the people who get this email won't fall for it, there is still that 0.01% who will.  Additionally that 0.01% is going to be easy to scam and wont take a lot of time.  
The biggest time commitment for the scammer is actually corresponding with the person.  You can send out 1x10^15 emails a day with little effort, but you can only actually maintain correspondence with 20 or so conversations, and each one takes a significant amount of attention.  Gotta keep the lies straight!
Now lets suppose they make the scam a little less obvious and more people fall for it, the number of people who will fall for it doesn't increase very much with the increased amount of time.  You're going to get more questions, which means sealing the deal takes longer and ultimately the person may figure it out anyway.  Next time you get one of those, email them back and pretend to be interested.
**TL:DR** The "Nigerian prince" scam is purposefully an obvious scam because it ultimately saves the scammer time

You shouldn't invest ALL your savings into BTC, but I don't see why it shouldn't be included. If you are young diversifying your portfolio is good and most people will tell you hedge your money on the side of greater risk now, and make safer investments later.  Yes it may go down, but if you're in your 20s, I'd say 10% would be a relatively safe amount to put into BTC.  Personally I have 30, but I'm a gamblin man with a decent regular job.

Fiat currency is currency which derives its value from government or law. Bitcoin does not. 
Additionally, because it is a finite resource it is inherently scarce. Scarcity has nothing to do with the ability of something to be divisible, but how much of that something you can have. Getting back to the pizza example, if I eat 10% of the pizza then that's it. There will be no more than 90% of the pizza left for other people no matter how many slices you cut it into. It is scarce in an absolute sense, not in a relative sense. Everybody on earth may someday own part of a bitcoin, but that part will be an increasingly smaller portion of the total number. It will be harder and harder to buy 1 bitcoin.

I'm less confident this is that great, as you said you enjoyed everything you watched from VICE, which means they sensationalize news they don't report it.  I'm also not so sure how "unbiased" a 20 something burnout is as a news reporter (thinking specifically of a piece they did on heroin). Compare their articles to Al Jazeera and I think you'll get the point.  Let's take the front pages of each right now;
"European court: Google must honor requests to delete certain links"
"Chemical spill fails to loosen coal’s grip on West Virginia politics"
"Ambush kills 7 Ukrainian soldiers, impairs dialogue effort"
"Glenn Greenwald’s New Book on Snowden Explains, and Humanizes, the NSA Whistleblower" This one's ok until you start reading the article.
"Angry fascist beat up Natzis" Note the uneccesary use of word angry.
"Muslims for Satan"
I'm not saying necessarily that this will be bad for bitcoin, I don't see how any exposure right now could be, but I have little faith in VICE producing a news story rather than entertainment piece and I'd get more excited if news about BTC was seen as more than entertainment.  It would be nice if that happened to news in general, but hey one mountain at a time.

I think people forget that credit card companies already accept some amount of risk when handling transactions, after all the card could be stolen or the person may declare bankruptcy and they are still liable for paying for the things the person bought. 
Assuming the machine IDs as you said, this is how I see it; if someone did double spend the ID would be immediately flagged preventing further theft. Also I'm sure there is a camera and it's not like it would be impossible to track someone down.  Sure you don't track the guy down that stole a hundred because it's obviously not worth it, but any large sum of money could feasibly be recovered.  I don't see how there's any more risk here than offering credit.

I have heard all kinds of FUD and been around here longer than most. Through all that I never read anything that I thought was a problem with Bitcoin itself, it was all about governments trying to "ban" it and people declaring it "magic internet money". I also found "experts" declaring it dead after drastic drops in price like when silk road was busted laughable, but these were all external to bitcoin. I see the "FUD" that is being spread now as an internal problem with BTC and how development is controlled. The obstacles currently facing btc growth today are internal for the first time ever and that worries me, but I'm not an expert nor do I claim to know where bitcoin is headed.

The consensus is happening, at least the quick exodus of active users from to is evidence of this, although I do not believe you even understand what consensus means. As you have said


If 90% of users agree that is consensus.
This combined with Bitcoin.org's treatment of Coinbase for merely mentioning they were open to the idea of experimenting with "alt coins" as you define them and the subsequent 95% vote on Github to have Coinbase relisted, which Bitcon.org completely ignored, makes it clear you and your cohorts have no intention to actually follow a consensus if that consensus does not agree with your draconian view of what Bitcoin "should be".

Is your personal standing then that I should have done my own research before buying the car (hopefully I can even find a third party that does the analysis I need in a transparent manner), found out the brakes were bad and therefore neither the government nor the automotive manufacturer can be held liable?
If so what grounds does anyone have for filling a lawsuit if a company can just claim "well if you did your research you would have known not to buy our product, fault lies with the user, not us.

So you are essentially condoning gaming the system. I have a problem with this "it wasn't strictly forbidden therefore I assumed it was ok" argument for a number of reasons, but I think they are best highlighted by a couple of instances where a corporation attempted to do the same thing. Let me know if you think the following are perfectly fine as well;
You're energy star rated refrigerator actually uses 3x as much electricity as advertised because the testing for that rating didn't specifically say the ice maker or freezer had to be running when the compressor was tested. Sucks to be you, the company didn't do anything wrong it is THE SYSTEM that needed to be fixed, how was the company to know the average consumer runs the fridge, ice maker, AND the freezer at the same time?!?! Ludicrous, blame the government and their incomplete testing standards.
You want your taco bell meat to contain at least 50% animal protein? Well, if the law doesn't say it has to be 50% meat, it just has to have "a significant portion of meat protein" guess what? Take the protein content down to 5% and you just gamed the system and reduced costs for your company, nothing immoral about that! The law doesn't say it had to be all meat to be called meat, it just had to have some trace amount in there.
Finally, it's fine for big banks to package subprime mortgages into overvalued assets tanking the economy, they didn't do anything illegal, they just beat the system... right?

Anyone who thinks a free VPN isn't selling data, or pays for one that dosent specifically says they don't keep track deserves what they get. Could the one's who say they aren't tracking be lying? Sure. Can you then sue them for damages and breach of contract, absolutely.

If I was paid in it, yes, but for short term things like credit debt and monthly bills it only costs me to convert to another currency. All my bitcoin is for saving/trading.

I put faith in low hanging fruit. It's not that a VPN is absolutely trustworthy, and it's not like if I lock my door no one is going to be able to pick the lock or break a window and get it, it's more a faith that the crook/government is lazy and is going to break into the house next door that is unlocked.

Lots of time frames are missing, 48 hours, 6 weeks, 6 weeks 1 day, etc. I'm sure someone's going to say "well those weren't options" but it changes nothing. This is still just picking the best data it just happens to be the default time frames as well.

Face to face transactions. localbitcoins.com is a good place to start, but coinbase, circle, etc. are just the next banks. I might question why op didn't sell his father-in-law the coins directly?

I hate to be this guy, but unless you're mining with an ASIC it's cheaper to just give monies to charity. If you really want to donate computing power there are a number of ways, I like folding at home personally, but mining bitcoin is not one.

I don't understand your logic, if the price dropped they wouldn't want a refund, they would want the product since that is worth more....?  If you buy X for 1 coin, at $10000, then the price of one coin drops to $500, didn't you essentially just pay $500 for X?
To clarify, a refund (should it be warranted) should refund the amount paid in the denomination paid, not the the "value" attached to a product independent of how it was paid for.  Imagine going to Walmart and asking for a refund based on the value of the product, not how much you paid (you actually paid more for the product than it is worth the instant you buy it due to endemic inflation).

That's not exactly how it went down, I believe (if I am not mistaken) the decision was facebook would send every user an email asking if they wanted to be compensated for a chunk of that $6.5mil, if few enough people asked then they the money would be divided amongst them evenly, however, if too many people asked the court decided the logistics of compensating everyone would be too much of a burden for Facebook and they could simply give one lump sum to a charity.  It was a groundbreaking decision though.

According to them (so who knows how much truth there is in it) if they can give "reasonable" reasons why it took longer it's not "illegal" and their TOS says "you are willing to wait" or some bs like that.

That makes sense, its easier for them to tell you to do all the leg work and is less liability and cost for them.  Paypal will initiate the refund processes though if you are persistent, just show them their TOS and explain you were waited more than the 45 days because you understand things come up and you wanted to give the company extra time to sort it out.  Remember you catch more flies with honey than vinegar.

I agree with one exception, if California, the G8, etc declare bitcoin an illegal currency then I can see the price crashing, now at the same time I don't see how they could reasonably do this.  A great deal of their argument rests on the idea that bitcoins are largely used for illicit trade (drugs), however, that could also be said of any currency.  As more and more legitimate businesses take them this argument becomes harder and harder to make.  
What I think is really going on right now we are seeing the backlash from wealthy and powerful people who are scared about a currency they can't control gaining actual value and market share.  Like early file sharing services like Napster and Limewire I believe the powerful may use nefarious means to essentially destroy bitcoins, but digital currencies will live on.

It sounds crazy but I bet if you could afford 10,000 bitcoins (about a cool $1 mil) you could seriously manipulate the market both up and down.  However, I doubt anyone with that kind of money is investing in such a volatile market.

I did this yesterday..
1) File a dispute (it will be closed).  In the reasons provide this link 
2) Call paypal, say "Agent" if you don't want to muddle through all the automated shit.  Found this out after googling it 10 minutes in....
3) The agent will likely know what you are calling about and explain the dispute was closed due to it being filed after 45 days.  Calmly and POLITELY (its not the agent's fault BFL are a bunch of scammers and got you to wait past their official deadline) explain it is a violation of their TOS and tell the agent to look at the notes for the claim.
4) The agent should escalate the dispute to a claim due to "special circumstances" (they probably know whats going on) or at least that's what they told me.
5) Wait, BFL has 10 days to respond.  This step may be avoided if you just want your refund, but I don't know from experience just other stories.  I'm willing to wait 10 more days to get my miner shipped so I was ok with this.

I'd imagine they only allow clear cut bets that could be checked, like the price of bitcoins on Dec 1st. 
 I suppose people could get pissy about technicalities like exactly when on Dec. 1st, but I'd imagine that doesn't happen frequently, and in the case that it does, their policy could be neither party wins and everyone gets their currency of choice back.
