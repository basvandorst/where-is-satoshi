You are all full of shit. None of you are sending 40-50k to coinbase!

I'm talking about the idiots who make $100 in crypto and file with the IRS. That's so stupid. This is crypto though. There are ways to move 10k around that won't trigger anything.

I never understand why people are so obsessed with a hardware wallet. Let's say your wallet breaks and you lost your seed. Then what ???
