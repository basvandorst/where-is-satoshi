Coinomi is an option to store a fair amount of altcoins. Most likely not all you are looking for, but an easier method than going only paper wallets. I am a fan and user of paper wallets, but as said above, not always the easiest to quickly get your coins back to hot.
Edit: as said *below

IMO, the making money business in regard to OP is all about your investment timeline. I believe patience will bring much more value, or money, to anyone with Bitcoin.

Mycelium, electrum, copay all seem well regarded. I have used copay myself. Great for diversifying security over multiple devices. As a simple example, set up an acct on your computer, add verification to your cellphone. This can accommodate up to, I think, 5 out of 6 devices needed to verify. Could also be 2, 3, or 4 of 6. Great for families or businesses  Paper wallets are great, but a bit of care must be taken in the key pair generation. Also, one must remember to sweep all funds from a paper wallet, use what is needed, and if anything left, you can always put in new paper wallet. The hardware wallets seem quite good as well, arguably easier than paper wallets, especially if you will be moving coins regularly. 
The altcoin world is a big beast, I would advise similar research before any major investments. 
Mistakes are fairly easy to avoid assuming you are paying attention during all transactions, inputting of values, addresses and such.
Good luck, be safe and smart.

I think Satoshi finally slipped up boys!! OP is SN!!!!

Also the many coins that have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 18-24 months. Bitcoin has crushed, no doubt, but there are multiple others that have crushed harder. Vaukins did say mostly, so we are on the same page I believe. And I would advise someone to put a solid portion of there blockfolio into Bitcoin if asked.

Couldn't care less may be a bit strong! The already lost bit is good though, a fine way of viewing initial value going into cryptoland, and a good place to draw the line when deciding how much value to enter.

But remember, today's small amount may be quite large in the future. Or it may turn into a paper bag.

Imagine the slopes as resistance to rolling a ball. Green side is buys, red is sells. The huge green wall means, if nobody changes there mind on the buys they have submitted, then a lot of resistance is set up to stop the price from dropping much.

I like to think of them as value, so here is another analogy with value in mind. Although, of course, the info in an email could be very valuable. So say digital gold type value. Much more fungible than your valuable personal information.
You have a public key, which is akin to a modern day bank account number. You can tell this to anyone with no risk. They can use this to send you some bitcoin into your wallet via your public key. 
You have your private key. This is akin to a physical safe, be it in a bank or your home or wherever. The catch is, the safe is open. So naturally, the location of the safe is of high value, not something to be given freely. Only those with the private keys can send bitcoin from your wallet.
You can encrypt your private key with a password or passphrase. This is akin to locking the safe. If someone stumbles upon your safe, or private key, they would still need this encrypted key to utilize their discovery. Simply an additional safety layer.
There are more safety features to learn. Paper wallets, hardware wallets, 2fa, and more I cannot think of and more I have not yet learned myself. People will stress the importance of making backups of your keys and passwords/phrases. Good advice. As others have said, welcome and have fun.

I am not sure patience is relevant here. I mean, we are still in a bull run, or did I miss something? There was a correction, sure, but followed immediately by a continuation of the uptrend. To new all time highs. And here we are, still creeping up. Is a few days of steady all it takes for people to start losing patience? As for your questions about price, what timeline are you wondering about?  
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:25:22
Yes, as if fiat will suddenly stop inflating and all will hold value from now on. Sure, sure it is done growing. /S

As to everything past the title: Bitcoin is not legendary, it has just begun. Not even a decade old. Incredible I would kindly suggest as an alternative. No kool-aid here. Just friends. It does seem like gold 2.0, because a lot of its, um...core policies and guidelines are designed similarly to gold. Yet just seems very narrow sighted, as there are other uses than simply safe haven value storage. Sending value to your family in another country, as an example. And of course central banks want to use the technology, it could save them loads of money.

Why exactly? If I were to have bought 0.99 bitcoin, I would be kicking myself??

The trust is not in the hardware of the USB. The trust is in the cryptography. If your ledger breaks, your Bitcoin are not lost.

No. Molecules consist of elements. Kinda the whole point of being in the element club.

Could a properly vetted smart contract do this? Ethereum ran exchange to keep out the undesired? The Ethereum shout out is 1/2 in jest, but seems like it could be done if properly tested.

I believe the landfill coins are due to losing the private key files, excuse my obvious beginner knowledge of it all. Or like you said, the passphrase may have been encrypted on the HDD, and if that is lost, I believe you are equally hosed. Paper wallets the same, lose the keys or the password/phrase and kiss those coin goodbye as well. Bitcoin is far from perfect in this regard, but not terribly different from keeping a chunk of gold. If you lose it, that's gone too. And if you can reasonably keep a chunk of gold safe, you can reasonably keep your Bitcoin safe. Backups are allowed in Bitcoin land, not so much for gold, so utilizing this perk will greatly diminish the chances of losing your coin.

Elements don't have molecules. Elements make up molecules. These are the very definitions. Molecules can be made up of one element or many, and properties are wholly dependant on the conditions under which the molecules, or elements, find themselves.

There are lots of options better than coinbase, or anything else in which you are not in control of your keys. Hardware wallets are a great option, but there are free options that are much better than letting someone else hodl for you.

Ideally you meet someone somewhere public and make a trade/barter for Bitcoin. Are you confused on sending/receiving transactions? Or navigating localbitcoins?
