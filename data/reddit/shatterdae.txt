Careful with Walmart marketplace orders. they don't monitor them much in contrast to Amazon. I'm in the middle of an ordeal with WALMART due to them putting all blame on the "marketplace vendor" and have been told for over a month now they cannot do anything. 
Click on the third party sellers name. If their profile is blank, has poorly filled fields with no reviews, that should be enough to deter you.

I hope he didn't pay 40 BTC for that.

Funny you mention it. Another batch of Tether just released. I'd link you, but I can't find the post calling it out.

I can agree with your overall sentiment. I have high risk tolerance, and so maybe my "fuck it" attitude led me to invest a substantial amount (for me, anyways) into crypto. At this point, I think that the tech is here to stay, but which ones? While I agree with your *flash in a pan* sentence, we may disagree on what will be around in a few years. I have some money in different cryptos because I know that many Alts could become obsolete. Hell, BTC could become obsolete. Of course I don't consider this "diversification" by traditional standards, so I have also dipped into more traditional investment vehicles (stocks and bonds) and am working towards buying a second house to turn into rental income.

Where does everyone get their credit card processing numbers from? The processing company that my employer transacts through charges .9% for debit and 1.9% for credit card. Now financing is another story. That percentage is dependent on the amount being financed. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:48:28
Yes, I agree with this.

I'm sorry for your loss, but please realize that this is not a reflection of how we need Banks but a reflection of the importance of learning the ins and outs of a new technology before using it. As others have said, not your keys, not your Bitcoin. That's all. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:29:34
That's the fastest I have seen a sloth move. Ha.

A central authority can basically limit what you can do with ***your*** money. People have had their accounts frozen for perfectly legal transactions. This should be alarming to anyone who lives in a free country. It's never a big deal until it happens to you. A central authority can also commit fraud and change the ledger because they are the ones in control. This contributes to fraud, money laundering, double spending, misappropriation of our tax money, etc.

Soon as she runs off with Jose you should have restored your seed into another device and transfer the funds out!! 
I had to, my bad. 
But agree with all your other points.

Nice! Thanks for your efforts!

He said take out a mortgage for the long position. Other expenses are covered by selling cars, spouse and the lower performing child(ren). Keep the smart kid and any dogs of course, dogs will be by your side and won't nag you to sell when you're in the red.

I'm gonna put some 3D glasses on real quick. Brb. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:02:50
That won't happen til you sell everything you own for Bitcoin. It needs to know you're serious. For serious. It knows. /s
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:03:39
Great news! Thanks for the update.

Teach you how to buy high and sell low. Consolation prize is an extra dollar off the $5 footlong at the Subway downstairs. XD

I wonder what's really keeping them from adapting? Bank of America is one of the first banks to have patents related to blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Interesting how it will all play out. 
A lot of people are holding for profits only. I feel that, who doesn't want to make money? But my main objective is to hold til the day we no longer have to cash out into fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:28:43
True if huge.

Where are you located OP? I've read posts from several occasions where people had their accounts frozen or closed. Most of them were in "free" first world places like the US and the UK.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:17:40
You should definitely consider the thought of possibly getting worried in the near future XD
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:14:18
This is the answer I was looking for. 
So, you're saying there's a chance?! XD
