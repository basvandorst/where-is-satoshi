You don't know shit about economics, please quit spouting an uneducated opinion. I know you THINK you're educated, but your opinion proves you are either a brainwashed dumbfuck or just a plain old troll. Spreading misinformation during the information arms race we're experiencing is dangerous.

Bitcoin does not identify with your petty partisan beliefs. Get that toxic shit out of here.

You fail to realize the money is the common denominator, not the people. Money is the problem, eat the rich and abolish their money.

That's simply not true. Take your govt anti-crypto propaganda elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:36:36
You're stupid aren't you?

But capitalism is still the real problem, capitalism is the only reason ANYONE is living in poverty in the USA.
@_date: 2018-06-02 05:18:44
That's capitalism's fault. Hopefully one day we will never need cryptocurrency or any measurement of "wealth" but instead be judged by our character and accomplishments
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:19:55
That kind of growth would likely be unhealthy.

All the constant bcash bashing in this sub reveals how insecure you shills all are about bitcoins future. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:42:15
This is not true, that dude is a bitcoin shill who doesn't want to see any other cryptocurrency become viable. People like this guy think if other cryptos outperform BTC they won't become millionaires  
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:29:38
I guess I thought when cryptos "took over" is what we would consider reaching "the moon" metaphorically speaking.

Idk, Trump could probably run the US government into the ground giving cryptos the opportunity to dominate within 2 years.

Litecoin and Vertcoin are 2 that come to mind.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:16:45
Then they shouldn't be investing 3k period
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:38:05
Actually, that wouldn't be much of a problem. Do your research man.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:12:05
Coinomi is my choice.

0.00456327 BTC = ~$24.37 at the time of the transaction. Where are you getting 6 cents from?
Edit: Also, this is a transaction for .1 BTC, as I understand that's 10mil satoshi. Seems significantly greater than 5 satoshis.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:03:24
Wowzers. I guess I learned this lesson the hard way.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:03:45
Yeah, Im not gonna lie I'm a little butthurt about it. Should I contact their support? I've heard their support is pretty useless anyway.

Wait, you're saying GDAX charged me that much? I thought that fee was some sort of network fee. Guess I'm done using GDAX, I started using GDAX because I thought they were supposed to have the lowest fees, but that's almost 5%.
