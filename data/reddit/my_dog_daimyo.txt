Do you guys not understand that as an asset gets bigger volatility tend to decrease? 
what was a dip last time might not necessarily be a dip this time.

Actually volatility should drop. 
- Bitcoin is around 300 billion now, most short traders don't have enough liquidity to sell into the raging demand right now unless it is coordinated (possible i admit). Big banks and hedge funds are probably still sitting on the sidelines waiting for the dust to settle. 
And for every person short on a contract there is a long. So it relatively evens out.
-People can now also hedge drops in price using futures instead of selling. For example, some big wig trader who owns 1000 coins is getting trigger happy because he thinks the bubble is going to pop. He can now enter into a short position using futures that will allow him to sell at some predetermined price out of market. Which means that he doesn't have to sell into a crash, thereby lowering overall volitility.
i would like to add that most people that trade in the stock market doesn't use futures to short...they just short the stock instead. So it is not as common as a thing as people on here make it seems like.

did you just write an article comparing bitcoin to gold? you do realize that no body uses a gold standard anymore right?
So you basically just made an argument that bitcoin will be replaced like gold did. idiot.

Because futures can be used as a hedging and leveraging tool, in which case it would have a impact on the underlying, thereby shifting prices.
But I agree with OP, it's not going to have nearly the amount of impact as people thinkg

what is value here though? Bitcoin has no fundamentals to based some measure of value on. It's pure supply and demand. 
If you actually go and search bitcoin on google trends you will see that it's basically a smoothed out graph of bitcoin prices. Like I said pure supply and demand.

isn't this the exact reason you should get bitcoin?

Did you know Bernie Madoff started NASDAQ? Just FYI when using NASDAQ and regulations in the same word.
And yes everybody sees the $$$$ with bitcoins, and let me assure you the big boys are seeing a fat pig ready to be skinned.
