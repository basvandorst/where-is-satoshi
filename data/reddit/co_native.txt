Just sent 0.03579878 BTC to Overstock. It was super easy and I got a confirmation email almost immediately after. Love that I can use Bitcoin to get some things I actually need.

Nice rig! Did you build it as a gaming laptop?

I would love to see one in Denver, CO!

I just made the blog yesterday. People just sent money to my email address through paypal so no website was necessary. I guess a website for bitcoin isn't needed either but I wanted to post some more bitcoin info as well so people could get started.

I'm just curious, and someone please correct me if I am wrong (which I most likely am), but wouldn't a bitcoin ATM solve the 3rd party deposit issues?

I get that! Should have made it more clear in the title that I wasn't actually asking for donations. Thought the lack of actually asking for them would have been enough. I'll be more clear in the future. I still plan on posting an update to let you all know how it goes!

I guess that's true. Sorry I guess I was showing off a little. Just wanted to show you guys my little micro-promotion for bitcoin. The majority of the people I link to the site will most likely not have a bitcoin account but if I can get a couple on board, then I will feel like I helped a little. The majority of our donations are cash and giftcards anyway, even when we used paypal.

We were? I'm sorry I don't understand what you are saying. Even when using paypal the vast majority of donations were cash and giftcards.

Just to be clear, I am not asking for donations from reddit users. This is just a page I created to link friends and family to. Just thought I would share with Sorry if it came off as soliciting donations from reddit.

Wow Bama, really appreciate it! PM me your email if you want and I will send you some pics of the kids getting their winter gear!
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:47:00
Very cool I'll send some that way as well! Roll tide!

I made a site because each year we get more intrerest from friends of friends/family. Just wanted something they could link anyone interested to. Again sorry if it came off that way!
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:37:24
I will but I keep all the donors emails in a spreadsheet, then we send a mass email with photos to all the donors after we hand out the winter gear. People like to see exactly where their money went. Most donate in cash anyway so really that was just a way to get some people to look into bitcoin.

We aren't asking for random donations, this is a page I made for family and friends. Not asking for any outside donations, sorry if it came off that way! Just wanted to share with that I am trying to promote bitcoin in my own little way!
