Coinbase, app on your phone as well. super easy. They will need to verify your debit/credit card though. They'll put 2 values in, you confirm them. But its fairly quick usually.

If OP allows it, I have some more tax related questions I figured I will just throw in here. 
If I had holdings on Coinbase, sold all my cryptocurrency, but never actually cashed out, the USD was just sitting in my Coinbase account, So would that be considered a capitol gain as it was sold for USD, but never touched any bank account, etc. 
Will I need to prove each and every single cryptocurrency transaction I do, such as changing say Ethereum to Golem, etc? Or just prove the initial investment.

I'm new to the game, and still learning. But why are people so adamant about keeping their cryptocurrency off of Coinbase after buying it.

Yeah, you can buy fractions of Bitcoin or any other coin. So you could essentially put down $50 on Bitcoin, Litecoin, Etc. 
But more importantly it was just easier to signup for exchanges/wallets to start buying into the Crypto market. It didn't take long at all, and not too many questions were asked. 
I have recently starting looking into stocks but it seems every firm I look at to start, asks a million and a half questions, how much money you make, how many dependants, what kind of investments you want to make, etc. That right there is enough to turn a lot of people away.
Especially if they're in the "I just want to own a few stock in Amazon for Christ sake".

Its probably because the barrier for entry is much higher for buying stocks, than buying crypto. It is a bit outrageous the information some firms want for you to invest in stocks..

You don't have to buy a single Bitcoin to buy into the crypto market...

I did randomly get charged $400 from coinbase on my account this past week. My bank instantly refunded me. Shows up on my statement and everything. I haven't opened Coinbase in a month though, and it was quite odd.
