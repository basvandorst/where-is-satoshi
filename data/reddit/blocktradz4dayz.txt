Volatility is getting higher than earlier in the year. Trend reversal my friend, if you can even look at volatility long-term, which you really can’t. You can break it up by year and average it maybe. 
My goodness, your statistics must be really rusty, or nonexistent.

Volatility is not something you zoom out or look at long-term. It’s standard deviation, not expected return. Statistics is fun, right?

2011 is an irrelevant comparison for volatility, as conditions were completely different. Volatility is really only good for comparisons up to a year.

@_date: 2017-12-25 08:05:57
Whoops, I’m not that familiar with technical analysis and got it confused with relative strength, instead of relative strength index. My bad.
Wouldn’t this also tell you that if it isn’t close to 30, that BTC is not oversold? Is there any bullish divergence with price movement (RSI) and the price? Because I’m seeing bearish signals, since the price reached a new high, but the RSI did not reach a new high, nor did the price and RSI reach a new low when it came down. I’m not seeing much bullish divergence from this chart.

Your RSI indicator doesn’t mean anything. Only when it’s below 30 does it mean BTC is oversold...
RSI is meant to measure strength against a benchmark. People use it to find top performers in a market, such as a stock against an index. Using the dollar as the benchmark doesn’t make much sense. BTC is does not function as a currency anymore, it’s a crypto asset/settlement layer.

Compare that to the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 6.14% during the same time period, which includes reinvested dividends.

And your example proves that the traditional banking system makes it hard to money launder without getting caught. Regulators can spot the transactions and you get caught. Your cognitive dissonance is astounding though.

Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. It allows for peer-to-peer transfer of data, and prevents previous data from being altered. This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records, and other records management activities, such as identity management,transaction processing, documenting provenance, food traceability or voting.

It’s because a lot of Bitcoin (or crypto in general) supporters think blockchain is a disruptive technology that can replace the current financial system (i.e. “the jewish mafia bankers are evil, Bitcoin fights the evil!”) ... when it’s only a foundational technology that has the potential to improve the current financial system.

He lost my faith when he stopped using his pricing model for BTC after it hit $5,000. He also said when BTC fell from 19k to 10k it would bounce to new ATH even higher shortly after.

Yeah you can verify an account, but no one verifies where you’re getting Bitcoin from. Literally, I know a drug dealer that uses Bitcoin for money laundering. He takes Bitcoin for his product and has it sent to his hard wallet then to CB, withdraws, and nothing happens... It’s done person to person.

You can do it online up to $10,000 per bank accounts daily from your computer... Use more than one crypto exchange and you got a money funnel system without leaving home. 
More leg work and time with actual cash for just the same amount. Deposit $10,000 at one bank. Drive to another, deposit $10,000. Go to another bank, deposit $10,000 more. 
Money Laundering:
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:33:06
Again, forwarding my point. The cognitive dissonance is palatable.
That guy in Russia had over $4 billion caught being laundered. Boom.
The transactions obviously didn’t use crypto to move money between banks. 
Do you even know what money laundering is? 
The point of money laundering is to get it back into the banking system! Like into a bank account. You want regulators and banks to not detect it! 
Banks are constantly assessing risk. If they fail, they are penalized even more money if not spotted.

The futures are cash settled and Bitcoin is not a commodity, so the rules you’re trying to apply doesn’t work. This whole idea is thrown out when the ETF creates more shares so the ETF price = underlying. For this to work, the futures would need to be settled with actual handling of BTC. It’s cash settled, so there’s much less influence on the price of BTC. What you’ve explained only with commodity futures that involve actual delivery of the underlying asset. 
If the ETF did affect prices, its shares short sold to hell and kill BTC. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:36:49
LMAO big claim from a nobody. Perhaps I didn't explain it well enough...
I have a degree in finance and I am pulling from my fixed income and derivatives textbook from school. There is no documentation that cash settled futures affect or predict price discovery. However, it is documented futures on commodities do affect price discovery because there is physical delivery of the underlying asset. The futures price is then the best predictor of the future spot price upon settlement. For example, if you go long on pork belly to the expiration, you are delivered pork belly.

Your second part is wrong though. ETFs don’t trade exactly at NAV. There are arbitrage opportunities for ETFs daily. ETFs have a redemption/creation feature, which typically ensures the share price doesn't stray significantly from the net asset value. If it’s well managed, the price of the ETF won’t affect bitcoin prices, but Bitcoin will affect ETF prices. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:04:25
Actually, I do understand them, but I’m arguing against Bitcoin advocates so it’s not like you guys understand markets very well. But I’m in an echo chamber so it’s not like I’ll win through upvotes. I traded oil futures, taking a short position, and profited in March 2017... 
And that’s not the point I was getting at nor related to what I said, so you didn’t prove anything here. Contracts for cash settled futures do not affect the spot price of the underlying assets, but do influence spot prices for physical delivery. There is empirical evidence to support both of these. An ETF on Bitcoin would has no effect on the spot price of Bitcoin because ETFs have share issuance provisions built in preventing market prices from straying too far from NAV. If the underlying benchmark is cash settled Bitcoin futures, then there is no affect on the Bitcoin spot from the ETF. 
Yes you are correct that arbitrage trade between futures and ETFs has nothing to do with cash settlement or physical delivery. But an ETF with underlying futures as the benchmark that is cash settled would have no effect on the spot prices of the underlying asset. For example, prices for cash settled S&amp;P 500 futures do not affect the S&amp;P 500 index. S&amp;P 500 futures prices are influenced by the underlying index, but can stray from the underlying index as speculators bet on whether their settlement price will be above or below the underlying index. The same could be said for VIX futures, which do not effect the underlying VIX index. This is also why S&amp;P index funds hold the underlying and not futures... 
Again, your previous example would work only if the underling futures prices were settled with actual delivery.
