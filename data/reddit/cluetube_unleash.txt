I see the benefits in terms of increased security, and I totally agree on the fact that people cant be reliable to secure their own funds. That would end in a disaster and probably in an increase in poverty. Anyway, here comes a "might be" drawback. In order to be attractive for people with considerably small funds the fee for such a service must be quite small. This implies that for such a "service provider" the offered service must be highly scalable to hedge themselves against their risk and make them profitable. I see that resulting in cartells which then again can play with the fees in a way they desire. Of course, you would always have the option to quit the service, and overtime this would result in an equilibrium, because the "service provider" would be forced to lower the fees again, but meanwhile miilions of people will lose their funds. They are not able to effectivly secure their funds by their own. We agreed on that.

Very nice thinking. In my opinion deflation itself is not a bad thing. Actually, deflationary money suits better the definition of what money should be in term of store of value.
But the big issue are the people. If we speak about deflation we also have to speak about employment, because in theory deflation goes hand in hand with an increase in unemployment. The reason for this is the downward nominal wage rigidity, so to speak the unwillingness of people to accept cuts in their salaries which would be a necessary sidekick of deflation.
There is actually small eveidence that people accept nominal wage cuts under certain circumstances. But generally speaking it would a tough road to go.
But, I like the idea of cutting out the unnecessary abundance.

That is not true since central banks and their influence are not limited to one country and a national currency can have a great impact on the economy of other nations that do not even share the same currency. Monetary policies, especially of the big economies, are subject of international concerns. Furthermore, Sweden as a more and more becoming cashless economy is a good example for the fact that digital money and fiat money in general can be competitors and replace eachother.

I am afraid that at least the first version will be in German. Depending on the results it might be translated into English afterwards. In that case, I will remember you.
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:03:17
Thanks man, really appreciated!
@_date: 2018-06-14 08:02:47
Thanks, I will take a look!
@_date: 2018-06-14 08:02:34
Thanks, I will take a look!
@_date: 2018-06-14 08:26:05
Wow, thanks a lot guys! That sounds interesting. I will definitely take a look.

I have to disagree again. Cryptocurrencies are subordinated to the term "digital money" since digital money / digital currency is defined as a type of currency available only in digital form, not in physical. That includes cryptocurrencies too. 
To be honest, I am not sure if I understand your last statement correctly. Of course, USD or Euro are not equal to central banks but they a subject to them

I will check them out, thank you!

I started to read the article and unfortunatly it became very clear, that Mr. Brett was acting out of his expertise. Although he tries to give his article/ paper a scientific sound, I doubt that he have ever learned how to do it properly. So, no disrespect to this man and his work butin which regards did he add any value to the discussion? I am sincerley interested in your opionion and where you see the value of his writing.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:08:45
Ok man, a little deeper understanding of economics and the basic functionalities of money would not hurt you.
@_date: 2018-04-30 08:19:32
Okay I think I understood your point of view, but I have to ask again why would any bank want to do it? And why should we call it a bank since any entity could provide that kind of service? 
For me it simply sounds like an idea for securing your funds from being embezzled, nothing more. No offense by the way.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:36:57
Yeah sure but as I just answered to lizard´s comment, that seed makes no sense to me. You could do the same shit with a private key
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:28:16
but a hardware wallet can get lost as well. And multi-sig wallets need some sort of private key as well plus you have to trust other parties as well
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:21:39
Ok sorry guys for the confusion. I guess the key question is: Are there any wallets you can use that implemented another more secure way to get access to your funds? And by more secure I mean that you don´t lose your entire funds when you lose your private key for example.
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:54:08
so in other words you dont know what you are talking about
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:05:35
I will check it out, thanks!
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:03:44
Of course there is and most probably wont be anything with an absolute level of security, but the risk to lose your private key/ seed or the information that are needed to recreate them is soooo much higher than losing the access to your money on your bank account. You could lose everything there is and still there would be always a way to get access to your funds. That is why in my opinion there is a solution needed that might not be perfect but better than the current solutions we have.
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:00:20
I understand your point of view but heading into a future where we most likely will have all the coins on universal wallets, I think it is unlikely or at least unnecessary to have more than 3 wallets. Anyway, that statement is highly theoretically and based on nothing but my own opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:35:23
thanks for the detailed explanation. What I was looking for is a solution you cant lose. You know what I mean? All that solutions are nothing but another form of a private key. You can also back up your private key in thousand different locations all over the world, so what is the seed good for? Can you recover the seed if you loose it? And if not, where is the advantage to a private key? Maybe I miss out something very important here, but it seems to me as an unnecessary step in between to create a false sense of increased safetiness.
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:48:05
You see, I couldn´t disagree more with you. Most people wouldn´t be able to come up with a accurate definition of money, and the crypto cummunity is not an exception to it. Maybe it used to be in its early days, but for sure it is not anymore. Most people in this market don´t have any clue about economical context or market and price analyses. They follow blindly FOMO, FUD and Youtubers.
Furthermore, I would be interested in your point of view why this video is a bad explanation if you don´t know what money is. Because from where I stand, it looks that it names a lot of important aspects of money and the necessary of its existance such as coincidedence of wants, and explains it in an easy way to understand. 
It is a pitty that people are always so quick with their judgement, but they dont take the time to back up their opinion with any arguments. Only through that way we can have a decent discussion, and an open-minded discussion is the best way to learn from eachother.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:04:42
That is an interesting idea but any trustworthy entity could secure your private keys as you described it. Or are you talking about having the funds on a bank account? What would be the difference to today? How would you prevent them from gambling with the numbers in their accounts? I have not got your point yet. Maybe you can explain your thoughts in more detail.
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:47:16
Yeah, that is a fundamental question about what people argue about centuries. I need to do more research on it. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:58:00
I know how a gold backed economy works and by the way that is a totally different story. I can not retrace where you see the similarities but I would like to hear it.
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:59:34
I just watched it. I like it but what I don´t like a critical videos without offering an alternative solution.
It is one thing to call the current monetary system a fraud - which it is, but that is not enough. You need to deliver solutions and that is what I miss here.
Anyway, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:47:46
How so?
@_date: 2018-04-30 08:14:28
I see. And what do you think about deflation? Don´t you think that would be an issue?
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:01:01
Well, I get your point but I think you underestimate the role of central banks today. You cannot just remove the whole banking system, and think everything will work out because people will figure out how to deal with it. The world changed a lot. You cannot simply adjust what worked over 100 years ago to our current economy.
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:05:47
Well, at first it does not sound like a problem because that would imply that welfare would rise. We could get more for the same amount of money. But there is a trade-off because an increase of the welfare on the consumer side goes hand in hand with a decrease on the producer side. I guess that is why people say deflationary money is a pull back for the economy

I have no experience with HD wallets, so can you clarify for me if you are able to determine your master seed by your own or is it a given code?
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:29:14
The issue is you can also loose devices like a hardware wallet
