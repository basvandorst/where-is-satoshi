And that contract would fire the moment a crappy exchange misreported the price as over 100k (it's happened).

Not my logic, bro.  That's your own thought, and has nothing to do with what I just said.
How can an ISP sign a transaction with a key they don't have?  Or modify a transaction I have signed?
They can't.  What are you on about?

You're right, the site changing hands to another person who is not Satoshi means that site is now *totally* related to him. /s

Could you be a little more specific?  I've read about a quarter of the spec since you've responded and I've not found a single reference to a maximum funding of a channel (I've so far looked in the documents that specifically deal with channels and their creation.)
EDIT:  Hol' up.  I *may* have found it.  You referring to the optional `max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat` on channel creation?

Gold has appreciated.
Something is wrong with your definition.

The point is, it's not a trustless contract.  It places trust in third parties for accurate reporting, and the ability to stay alive for a year.
What if your chosen two exchanges die before the contract is up?  
What if one dies and the other misreports?
What if one reports 50k correctly and the other misreports 200k? (125k average).
This requires human intervention to guarantee correct settlement.  Horrible idea to use a smart contract here.

Sure did!   It said, "Pure gold *is* slightly reddish yellow in color."  
Wasn't it you who said that gold *is not* a yellow color?
Did you even click it?

Bitcoin.com asserts it is following Satoshi's vision and uses his name quite extensively.
Satoshi clearly calls this site unrelated to his work (i.e. *fraudulently* advertising it is related to Bitcoin)

I'm looking for proof that the initial amount sent to a channel is the upper limit, and that *no more funds can be sent to the channel* once it reaches that amount.
What I get from this is that the balances *in the channel* may not exceed the channel's total amount.  
"Balance A + Balance B &lt;= Channel Total"
This *doesn't* say the channel cannot have that upper limit expanded by [the channel] being funded with additional coins (in an on-chain transaction).

You're yelling at somebody over the internet for their username, instead of sticking to what it is we were talking about (meltdown).  You are so *upset* by the word Trump that you couldn't stop from launching vitriolic comments (feces).
It *sure is* hyperbolic.  That's kind of the point.  Hyperbole was the perfect literary tool to illustrate how the absurdity of your unnecessarily strong responses appears to the casual reader.  
There is no other way to illustrate that to you.  Simply pointing out what you did wrong is ineffective, because you think your vitriol is *acceptable.*  For example, the following comment was totally unsolicited:


You were being a dick, just because you saw a username you didn't like.  I can think of no better metaphor or hyperbole than a chimp flinging its feces in a meltdown of rage.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:42:25
Trump is living rent-free in your head, isn't he?   So much so that my *username* triggered a miniature meltdown.
Can you not resist throwing feces at the first (non-)mention of something?

Depending on the code base, decentralized ones can be tampered with just as easily. Just have every client recognize the central server's signature as an authority.  
For example, permissioned blockchains - only wallets granted recv and send permissions (in a permissions transaction) can receive and send assets. (e.g. MultiChain).
That said, decentralization of assets on a blockchain will never work.  Until we have blockchain attached decentralized holding facilities for physical assets (or something equally as crazy)... SOMEBODY has to be trusted to honor all that soycoin.

Yeah, you can brute force more Band-Aids on.  
Doesn't solve the underlying cut.  I can imagine *some* scenario in which the trust is broken.  
This is why we are aiming for trustless systems to replace said exchanges.
Imagine a 10-year contract.  *No* exchanges have lasted that long.  (Assume none will.)  What now?
Imagine 3/5 misreport because of the same flaw (let's say all three exchanges happen to be by the same parent company).  Where's your median?

That's not how it works.  Making sure a mined block is legitimate is virtually instant.  The nonce is there, you can check it yourself.
In Bitcoin, a "confirmation" is *the next block*.  Because that signals that the miner adding the next block agrees that the current block is legitimate and mined on top of it instead of the previous one.

Remember that little kerfuffle over tea in Boston way back?
That was over 3% taxes.
Now the government takes like 30-50% of what you make.  Income tax.
It takes money for people to have the privilege of owning property, if you manage to save enough income to buy a small property.  That's another couple thousand a year.
Make money investing?  That's capital gains.  Gotta fork over 30% there, too.
Die?  What you leave behind gets taxes as well.
Why aren't people angry?  This is like living under mafia protection.  If you don't pay your share, the enforcers of their code come to your door.  In this case, the mafia calls their code "law."

This happens every time we have a massive spike like last December.  Welcome to Bitcoin, kids.  The chart is merely a repeating fractal of the Gartner hype cycle.

It's not strange.  Look at a chart of every big spike and subsequent fall.  This happens every. single. time.  Often for a year or two until disillusionment becomes hype again.
Google the "Gartner hype cycle."
Then google "bitcoin Gartner fractal" to see the pattern as applied to BTC.

Microsoft very intentionally (and very successfully) created .NET to be as different as possible from everything else out there, keeping the programmer far away from the details such that they’re wholly and utterly dependent on Microsoft’s *truly amazing suite of programming tools* to do all the thinking for them.
It's a hard pass unless you have some good justification for using it.  I put .NET code on par with doing everything in Excel spreadsheets.  Sure, you *can*, but you're going to have a really hard time explaining *why* you chose to do it.
To put this in perspective, if I see .NET on a resume, my first question is "why did you choose .NET?"  I'd love to see somebody, at least once, answer this one without blowing the interview.  
So... why'd you choose .NET?  :)

You get the idea.  The main pitch of this, rather than crypto, is gold, but you can disregard the pushes trying to get you to purchase gold and stick to the educational bits if you want.  Everything he says about gold, I believe, applies to cryptocurrency.  Hence the original name of Bitcoin:  BitGold.
They're actually *surprisingly* well formed for videos that seriously look like major FUD at first.

It won't.  There's at least a year of this left if you subscribe to the Gartner hype cycle theory and recognize its fractal pattern repeating time and time again within BTC.  Need the disillusionment to wear off before hype can start again.  
Remember how long it was from the Mt. Gox scandal until this most recent spike?
