These computing chips have no other useful purpose. The ASICs are only built around computing one particular hashing algorithm. You can't use them for Folding to help molecular biology, for instance.
I could go cash out my fiat into physical currency, USD. You could argue that increases demand for ink, linen, printing machinery. But that only is good for producing money. Those activities aren't useful for producing goods &amp; services for people.
Similarly, computers to maintain the blockchain are good at giving one pool or another competitive advantage in BTC production, but, overall improvement in the computers you can use to game, run general server applications, or carry in your pocket.

That's technically not correct.  Businesses can issue more stock nearly whenever they feel like it.  There is the pertinent paperwork and filings, but if they need to raise more money, issuing more stock is an option.  And if the existing stock price is high, that means the fundraising by creating more stock should go well.
There's other concerns about dilution of existing stock, voting rights, and such that have to be considered.  But yes, businesses can create new stock.

SHA256 is fine, but apolitical = advantage doesn't make much sense in this case.  Processors built around SHA hashing are of very limited, focused, use.  Mining BTC or a few other crypto-money.

Every bank that wants to be a member bank of the Federal Reserve System needs to buy shares in their local Fed bank proportional to the capital stock of the member bank. This is required if you want to be a member of the Federal Reserve.  The shares cannot be traded or sold to others, so the Fed provides a 6% dividend.  That is closest to the owners of the Fed.


Federal Reserve policy is decided by the seven-member Board of Governors (BoG) and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  The BoG determines regulations and governance policies that the Federal Reserve follows.  All BoG members are appointed by the President, subject to approval by the Senate. The 12-member FOMC is composed of the seven-member Board of Governors plus five voting Presidents from the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks.  The voting is on a rotation, except for New York Fed, which always votes.  The FOMC determines open market operations.


Federal Reserve was created 1913, crushed the economy with deflation in 1930's, reflated the economy when forced by Roosevelt &amp; WW2, lots of excessive high inflation in the 1970's, moderate inflation and solid growth from early 1980's till 2007, then the Fed crushed the economy again with deflation, but not as much as the 1930's.  And here we are today.

Those are captive stock holders.  Any bank that wants to become part of the Federal Reserve System is **required** to purchase stock proportional to the size of the bank's own capital stock value.
They cannot transfer or sell the stock.  For the requirement of committing part of that capital into the Federal Reserve System, it is the least the Fed can do to pay some sort of dividend or return.
But do not mislead by alluding that this "Fed stock" is in any way similar to owning stock in any other regular business.

It is entirely dependent on situation and the reason why the business issues the stock.

@_date: 2014-10-15 14:20:32
The only problem is buying money (BTC in this case) is different than buying stocks.  One is a type of investment (businesses issue stocks to fund/expand their business activities), but buying money alone encourages no such net real growth.

In most cases, the "medium of exchange" and the "unit of account" are the same.  I buy gasoline, the medium of exchange and unit of account are the same - USD in my case.
However, for businesses that accept BTC but settle to dollars - the medium of exchange is BTC, but the unit of account is USD.  Arguably it is the unit of account that matters most, because the *medium of exchange* will just keep fluctuating to meet the *unit of account* target.

It is good for integrity of the BTC system.  I think we are talking about two different goals.  I was saying that purchasing money doesn't increase demand for real goods or services - there's no real net growth.
I could withdraw all my fiat and do so after every paycheck.  If enough people did that, demand for ink, linen, printing press machinery would grow.  But even if the Fed goes ahead and prints more physical cash, that production doesn't produce any net societal benefit.  
Similarly with BTC, competitive pooling and mining has spurred demand and real assets being used to build ASICs dedicated to mining BTC.  But outside of helping produce money (bitcoins), the machines don't produce any other net societal benefit.

Inaccurate.  And the 6% dividend is paid on the initial capital stock investment that a bank is *required* to make if they choose to be part of the Federal Reserve system.  It is a function of the size of member banks, nothing to do with the Treasury.

For me, CPI feels pretty dang accurate.  Although you might prefer PCE since it is a larger basket.  And CPI, since it uses rental equivalent pricing in it's index, probably **understated** inflation during the housing bubble, and now is **overstating** inflation in the aftermath.

There's no way to be confident that raising rates would equal depression.  Doesn't seem likely from what I can see.
Well, at some point the Fed would run out of Treasuries to buy.  But they could potentially purchase currency or bonds of foreign governments, but might need authorization from the Department of Treasury to do so.  So QE for the next 500 years is unlikely to work, there just aren't enough assets to buy.
But I think where you were going was can QE be done long-term without penalty?  QE isn't even about the purchases, it's just a communication strategy (sadly).  An inefficient communication strategy, but it is what it has become.  A central bank engaging in QE indicates they are willing to support more inflation and nominal growth in the future.  A central bank that is cutting back on QE, or even raising overnight interest rates, is indicating they want lower inflation and nominal growth.
If it took a small amount of QE, say $5-10 billion/month, to keep inflation from going negative then yeah, they could probably keep it up for years and years with absolutely no downside at all.

And good riddance!  But one thing that was good about it was that it did clearly communicate changes in monetary policy stance, and people's perception of the money supply.  It has that edge over the use of short-term interest rates as the monetary policy instrument.
The Fed could go back to targeting a price of gold in USD, but the downside is that distorts the potential industrial uses of gold.  Better to target something that doesn't matter as much, and is not even a physical good - BTC!

If they want a recession, definitely the price ceiling should go.

Why not invest directly in the increased productive capacity and efficiency of the economy, rather than only investing in the currency and hoping others will do the heavy lifting?
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:32:32
Right, they will still use open market purchases of Treasuries.  But they will just change the target to be a price of BTC.  It just becomes a communication tool (target price of BTC) without the zero-lower-bound that interest rates can have.

100 years of history shows people who invested in stocks back then would have had immense increase in real wealth.  It beats all other investments.

We need to reward investors, not hoarders.

I am not trolling you.  I would use smileys or emoticons if I were.
I judge whether or not QE is timid by results.  If 100 billions USD monthly produces no rise of inflation, then it is timid.  Has Japan's nominal GDP or inflation surged?
Judge by results, not by how hard government policy makers say they are working. 
Also, there are the times Japan raised interest rates even though inflation was practically 0%.  That is not QE.
(PS I am not a Keynesian.)

Maybe the Fed could stop targeting interest rates, and just manage the money supply by adjusting the price of BTC in terms of USD.

It is probably easier to secure gold.  Cheaper, perhaps not.

Judging by the lack of vigorous recovery in nominal GDP growth or inflation, the Fed does not communicate clearly enough.
Or, the Fed prefers a lackluster &amp; protracted recovery.  In which case, their communication has been sufficient.

What do you mean by this ZLB affecting "regular stuff"?  The Fed would purchase all of the Treasuries on the open market, leaving none left to purchase?

Better than deflation from excess demand for Swiss franc.
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:41:15
Hmm, so if the Fed sells off Treasuries until the price of BTC drops to zero - then they lose ability to reduce the money supply (along with nominal growth and inflation) any further?

Isn't there replication time involved between peer-to-peer nodes?  That is because there is more than one node, and they are **not** synchronously updated. 
A centralized system has a single IP address or reference point that anyone can query anytime and it is accurate.  I'm talking a database here.  Blockchain is copied everywhere, *eventually*.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:34:22


Uh, no.  Do you think the Fed only communicates with interest rates?

The point Tyrion Lannister was making was inflation reduces the incentive to hold strict money balances. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 18:27:52
Oops, didn't notice.  But I also just wanted to highlight this one response.

These banks appear to exchange won for yen:

But there is no way to get insurance for a BTC deposit account.

I don't think all of them are Austrians economists.
