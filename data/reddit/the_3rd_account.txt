EDIT: 256,000 chips for 3.3ph/s is only about 13gh/s per chip, so I guess they're going for low density?

That's brilliant. If possible, I'd add a different one for every page to encourage per-use optional donations.

Double jeopardy only works in criminal cases I believe. Bankruptcy/liquidation is not a criminal issue and Karpeles hasn't been charged with anything afaik. IF he was charged and IF he was declared not guilty of whatever charges the US would throw at him, then yes he could try to hide behind double jeopardy but then probably face some other charges like perjury or what have you.

I'll grant that they were not necessarily selling all of the bitcoins, but does it not stand to reason that they would sell a large proportion of them for fiat so as to be able to restock their products? Barring the vendors already having a large bankroll so that they would not need to sell their btc and them having faith that btc will appreciate in value (the prior condition harder to fulfill than the latter but at the same time carrying much more weight), your conclusion does not stand (unless you try to play up all your downplayers such as "not necessarely[sic]" or "all"). 
DPR is a special case as he was not a vendor and did not have product to restock the first condition doesn't apply and seeing how pro-btc he is it's a no brainer that the second condition would apply.
In case my tone may be misinterpreted as offensive, this is said with all due respect.

Oftentimes pre-nups aren't enough. I'm too lazy at the moment to find precedent but judges have been known to throw pre-nups out the window on a whim. Also, as I'm sure you now know, certain states have particularly draconian laws regarding divorce so if you do decide to get married, even with a prenup, try to avoid getting married in those states.
If I may ask, out of sincere curiosity, why would you get married [again]? What benefits do you derive from marriage that you would not also derive from loving each other and cohabitating without a marriage certificate?

Stare at that block daily, let the message sink in.
Once the message has sunk in, sell the block, give your significant other her winnings and do your best to make that your last mistake of that type and I wish you luck in your future endeavors!

We wouldn't, they would be effectively gone. I don't understand the relevance though? Those bitcoins would be gone but there would still be others out there with known private keys, if piece by piece most of them are lost and we are down to, say the last 1000 satoshi's with a known private key, we could change the protocol (requiring a hard fork which at this extreme point would be mandatory as not enough coins would exist otherwise) and add say 6 decimals so 0.00001000btc would now be 0.00001000000000btc thus making it more divisible. What's important is having a sufficient quantity of units regardless of the size, value can be assigned to those units later.

Well here I'd like to bring back the credit card example, credit card companies are able to track every single transaction (that goes through their credit card) worldwide! And if requested by a government agency, they would share it with them!
You might respond to this with something along the lines of: "yes, a company can track the transactions that go through that company but ONLY that company" to which I would respond with different credit card companies would be analogous to the various alt-coins that will inevitably exist (with limited amounts of acceptance) alongside bitcoin.
So, if you're worried about the number of the beast, I'd say the credit card companies are pretty beastly themselves.

The moment he compiled the first bitcoin client bitcoins did not exist and therefore had no value, once the first block was mined they still had no value since the first block can never be spent. Even the second block still probably did not have any value since no one wanted to buy or [presumably] sell them. The first known "price" of btc was around 1600btc/dollar. A price that, at the time, theymos argued was too expensive. Funny how that sounds in retrospect.

Does your friend necessarily want a gpu mining rig or does he just want to "practice" mining? I was sort of in a similar position recently and was looking into gpu rigs in anticipation of my [eventually] incoming [company non-specified] ASIC(s) and ultimately I went with a pair of the USB block erupter being sold by ASICminer.
The USB, for the price it is sold now (~2btc) will likely never make roi, but with the latest cgminer it is very much turn-key, can be run from basically any desktop or laptop (and even a raspberry pi, though that'd be... less turn-key) and it would be much cheaper than an entire rig.

Think of it this way, I have also had significant difficulties getting the more elder of my relatives to "get it," so eventually I just stopped stressing about trying to convince them. Now, every once in a while I'll give them some pretty nice gifts and when they invariably seem to ask how I can afford them on an admittedly unimpressive salary, I just shrug and casually say that bitcoin has been treating me well and ask them how their stocks, precious metals, or whatever they're invested in have been doing lately. Yes this gets them flustered, at first, but after enough times, it'll get them thinking and thinking is the first step to understanding.
EDIT: I'm not giving away cars and shit like that, but some nice wine or scotch, a fancy-looking portrait of the family, that kind of stuff, pricey but not ridiculous. The point isn't to flaunt your success or incite envy, but specifically with the elderly (and I am aware about the issue of generalization and don't want to get into now), they have difficulty understanding non-tangibles and by showing them the tangible things that bitcoin has enabled you to get should push even the slowest horse over the finish line.
Also, this will potentially get them interested in btc as an investment but do NOT let them blindly invest. Once interest is established, leverage that interest to explain the benefits of the protocol itself, eventually the light bulb WILL go off

Send them a nicely worded (can't stress this enough, most people respond better when they don't feel attacked) email disputing that it was a high risk transaction and offer to show evidence (don't be specific as likely it wont even get to that). The reason your transaction was flagged is likely because, as you said, you are a first time customer and their risk flagging software is a bit overzealous for new customers.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:47:49
Usually the high risk email comes a few hours before your transaction was supposed to go through. You can always check your bank account though to see if the money has already been taken out as that would be a good indicator whether or not the transaction will have gone through.

I've been playing around a bit and found something that I found mildly interesting. It seems like for the last character, both 'e' and 'E' work, but not only that, the 'N' and the 'S' are also both interchangeable with their lowercase counterparts 'n' and 's' (even when both are simultaneously changed from NS to ns).
If I'm not mistaken, that gives us a total of 7 private keys for one public key.
Since the address is already redeemed, these are the following 7 private keys that correspond to the public key:
Going any further back than the 'n' changes the public key and the 'L' obviously can't be an 'l' as that character is not recognized by the code. Is there any significance to this or did I just wait the last few minutes playing around with blockchain.info?

Just out of curiosity, would knowing the physical characteristics of the people on the train tracks affect your decision whether to save them or not?
If you could choose between the 5 people on the tracks being men or the 5 people on the tracks being women, would your decision be any different based on gender?
I don't want to start a gender flame war so don't actually say which you would feel better about killing, I'm just curious if there would, in fact, be a difference in your ethical judgment of the situation based on the gender of the potential train victims.

SR users were a net zero to the bitcoin economy, for every bitcoin they bought to buy drugs with, the vendor from whom they bought from would sell that bitcoin to turn into fiat so as to get more supply.

I think C should NOT be held mutually exclusive to A or B. Allocate a certain percent (doesn't have to be large, 5-10% is more than enough) of bitcoin donations to hold in a sort of emergency/last resort fund long term that will [hopefully] grow [substantially] over time.
Between A and B, however, I would vote B, lower principle = lower interest = cheaper overall = more money for other uses.
Also, I'm too lazy to set up a reddit tip bot, but if you post or send me an address I'll gladly make my first donation (nothing crazy as I am not a wealthy individual, but an extra 0.2btc can't hurt).
