Taxes shouldn't exist at all. Or, at least, let people choose if they want to pay that shyt or not. Otherwise, the situation is called slavery, or theft.

The government is the winner, and he takes it all. He can do whatever the fuck he want's with you. In fact, he lives from stealing you and your family.

So should I give a fuck about your instructions? Haha no, thanks. 
Roads? Please, are you shure you want the whole population to be robbed, so that the government can build a fking road wich 0.5% of the people will use? Or you want the government to monopolize (or at least regulate and control) the whole communication and power industries?
By the way, if I want to build myself my own fucking roads, what will the gov do to me? (Don't know in the US, but down here in Brazil we go to jail if we do so).
And one more time: Emmanuel Levinas (philosopher) once said that before doing any sort of epistemological consideration (economics, sociology, etc), an ethical wheighting needs to take place. What's the ethics behind taxation? You refuse to pay = go to jail... Read this over and over, eventually your dumb ass will get it.

Indeed, I learned to read and write in a school... a private one. Public schools tend to be government's doctrination camp, so then kids can learn to love it and let it stick his nose in every aspect of their lifes.
But that is not my point. The government can ONLY SPEND WHAT HE STEALS FROM THE PEOPLE (taxes, inflation). That is unethical, a crime. Emmanuel Levinas (philosopher) once said that before doing any sort of epistemological consideration (economics, sociology, etc), an ethical wheighting needs to take place.

English is not my first language, so sorry for any possible typos.

I see, sorry Mr. Oracle.


LOL, Ideed, we have a small percentage of drivers here (around 20 ~ 25%). But in continental countries such as Brazil and the US I seriously doubt that more than 25% of the total "public" roads are used by more than 10% of the population (0.5% was a hyperbole). And even if that was the case, what makes you think that the government knows better about building roads than the road building companies? And even if he knew, what makes you think that the gov would want to provide better roads than the companies? If a company builds a shitty road, it may go bankrupt. On the other hand, the gov can build a road literally using shit for the pavement, people would still be coerced into paying taxes.


Well, if they consider themselves "sovereign" I think they don't share the same mindset about politics and economics that I do. I'm not sovereign, I just would like people to respect my private property. And if they want to be regularly stolen by the government in exchange for some roads, schools and Obamacare/ Trumpcare, thats fine, but I dont want to be part of it and no one should be able to force me to. 
Anyways, this political argument ain't going anywhere. Let's get back talking about crypto.

What if the BTC Guy is a crypto version of Chuck Norris?

That's some shitty economics knowledge right here.

No, my sweet winter toddler, nobody is saying that the dollar will collapse in 5 or 10 years, but that the very idea of your green dollars as "money" (and you probably don't understand the most basic concepts of economics, or currency) is a joke. Therefore, it will eventually collpase.
And as said by Stöferle "There are no press releases announcing it, and neither are there big international conferences that end with the signing of treaties and a photo shoot. "

There are several blockchain/ bitcoin education projects and pretty good books about it popping up in Brazil...

I'll buy till 25th... and then just sit and wait for some weeks

I feel like these bears still around. Therefore, I'm waiting (and hoping for) the next drop. Dont know about what you shuld do though.

Well, if I study some math that teaches me that 2 + 2 = 5, I cannot call that "math" (hope you understand that I'm comparing this to the neoclassical school of economics, for example, that simply does not make any sense). 
I will watch this movie, but I also recommend you to read "What has the government done to our money", Murray Rothbard. Yes, banks and politicians are our worst enemies.

Right, and the VCR was replaced by the DVD, that was replaced by the Internet and Netflix, and all that sort of stuff.
So, if Bitcoin eventually gets replaced by another better technology, im ok with it. What matters is the "decentralization" thing.

LOL for real, I'm going to ask him his crystal ball a lil bit
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:42:13
That's why jokes are so funny, especially when told by a genius like Clark; they satirizate the sad reality, making it funny. That's also why the essence of jokes are truly the sadness.

I wait for SegWit
People going apeshit...
Cuz' Bitcoin may split
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:04:25
Exactly, Bitcoin imitates gold's natural scarcity.
I think it's important for us to remember that the gold standard ceased to exist because it was not possible to inflate money that was backed by any precious metals. So in 1971, Nixon and the Central Banks around the globe abolished it, and today Bitcoin is able to bring back this safeness.

Its probably going to happen in two years at most.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:09:39
What? If you study some (serious) history of economics, you'll see that THE CENTRAL BANKS CAUSE INFLATION...
You will also notice that THEY CAUSED THE 2008 CRASH. And the previous one, and the other, and every one since 1913 (Fed's foundation).

I'm not shure if blockchain.info gives you the private key or if they control it...
but anyways, the recommendation is for you to control your private keys on your own

*using Bitcoin (I think you forgot that part)
