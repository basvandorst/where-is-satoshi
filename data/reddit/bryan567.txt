I have a question. I've considered selling bitcoins on LBC for profit but there's one thing stopping me. How do you rationalize all the cash coming in and out of your bank account for tax purposes? Are you operating in the US? According to my research, when any American bank account receives cash deposits exceeding $10000 in one month it is automatically flagged and reviewed by the IRS. It is then up to the account holder to provide information on the source of the cash to verify its legitimacy. Since profit made from selling btc is only a small fraction of the total amount being moved, I assume one would have to buy and sell quite a bit to make a worthwhile profit, very likely exceeding that $10000 flag amount. How does one prove to the government that only a fraction of the cash coming in and out of an account is actually the profit. Conventional accounting wont work here right? I mean, cash deposits from strangers into your account??! Also, do you use a personal banking account, or have you set up a separate business account that you only use for selling bitcoins?

Wow that was awesome! I had no idea bitcoin had all those hidden features built into the protocol. So many implications and possibilities! My mind is kind of blown right now.
