So yeah, if you don't think this is a crash, you've basically got Stockholm syndrome.
It may come back fine, like the global markets after 2008. It was still a crash and no sane person would deny that.

There is not a single example in all the world in all of history of a society getting anywhere near first world quality of life without strong central government. You're talking out of ignorance.
Here's a question to get you thinking, if you want: who's going to stop your free market from being undermined by whichever local warlord has the most ambition and guns?
