The books are thin.. remember what happened when someone cashed out their eth and pushed us to $10 It’s an extreme example but it shows what can happen when the market is still maturing.

Has anyone got an out of the box full node solution. I am not and dont have the time to Learn it beyond plug and play. This will only work long term en mass if this is a simple thing to do. I want to partake if I can financially contribute to a solution. If there isn't one I will finance one. Can you advise. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:27:43
So it is what the majority want? 
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:08:18
this is the right choice.
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:51:54
haha agree
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:33:05
Yes i know... just a typo on my part
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:08:16
Edit - I want a 1 oz not a 10 oz... that would be some coin!
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:57:25
I mis answered this response upon second review. clearly we both agree that this is not a free market, Although this rant was about exactly that. If this system is as you say, it will have failed.

Already invested.

I'm well hedged due to all this mess within the coins, although a bit coinmess in the media spotlight will cost us years. I hope that doesn't have to happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:23:16
Anything for success

No problem and agree! i just needed something which wouldn't violate privacy on youtube... 
@_date: 2016-12-22 02:07:51
Simply put; the miners arent making enough money without a price rise.
@_date: 2016-11-17 02:16:43

haha ok its exponential  my  mistake :)
@_date: 2016-12-17 11:06:31
ideally non digital..  Issue with paper is that it isnt the most robust of things.

BTC in the UK is treated as an asset in the same way Gold, Silver etc are treated, unless you are liable as a corporate entity.  You have an allowance of £11,100 per annum.  
This means you are only liable to pay tax when you sell something or a collection of things and make a gain greater than £11,100.   You can offsett losses in the year against the gains aswell both in year and those which were incurred and not used previously.  If you buy and hold and the asset goes up in value there is no tax until the sale.
Its unlikely that you will be making £11,100 profit from buying BTC and selling unless you are involved in huge volume or if BTC went up dramatically. IF BTC were to increase dramatically then you would be wise to hold on to it (of corse) but if you need to get it back into fiat then only sell amounts which realise your tax free gains.
As a side note, if you are a buisiness, BTC is treated like foreign exchange.  It needs VAT and forms part of your profit and loss on the margin made on the goods sold and is therefore taxed.  Any gains on holding it on your balance sheet is taxed in the same way FX gains on USD or EUR would be.

Now now let's not get personal, it's just my view of the market.
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:41:44
totally agree - the market will get overbought again.  Wont go beyond 650ish though and then back up.
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:28:57
Let's see how the chart plays out shall we. I believe that people are fundimentally wrong calling it a bubble due to transactional demand growth and restricted supply due to the halvening. This is my professional opinion. Good luck. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 11:51:34
hahah if that was true..!
@_date: 2016-12-17 14:36:52
ah sweet just seen on an unboxing.. hope they do uk shipments

youre joking or are you going full retard? never do that.
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:40:46
agree and i do expect a pull back - as i stated, this is the end of a fundamental correction.  I fully expect it to rocket too high and come right back down again.  The point im making is that its not like it was last time.. which really was a text book bubble.  The mania phase took off like nothing ever seen last time, and this time the same prices are supported by growth of the network and economics of the ecosystem.  
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:12:49
nice.. thanks.  this is a good and nearly free option. getting a fire resistant safe to store the silver anyway.
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:58:25
haha. no, just no.
Im head of finance for the business and am educating them.

Let me know when you have more wisdom for me yoda.

This is greta but only does  12 words for some reason!
@_date: 2016-12-17 11:58:27
That looks like a good solution.. thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:46:35
I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but price in a fixed supply based model is determined overwhelmingly by the level of demand. In economics, Demand is a derivative of certainty, which we are running out of. Growth in an economy or a currency is based around certainty. short term markets are built upon short term assumptions. Long term growth is based upon long term fundamentals. You suggest that the market will decide and that the market is free. It is not. It is manipulated overwhelmingly here by miners and developers so I reject that statement. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:05:40
entering bubble
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:02:19
we are now in a bubble lol :)
@_date: 2016-12-22 16:47:02


it is, or at least to me: its called the halvening, and simple supply and demand economics.  Miners; unwilling to supply at half the income post halvening, buyers demand supports new higher price, therefore price goes up.  -

wow thanks thats going to take some getting through!

if only there was a way you could anonymously incentivise someone from anywhere in the world to alleviate the risk...

@_date: 2016-09-26 22:45:16
nice.. i/we will check it out!
@_date: 2016-10-29 00:05:16
i hope so.  there are obviously some people who are going to cause a problem fiat or otherwise but.. shit.  why am i looking over my shoulder.. at all!!!
@_date: 2016-10-29 00:10:19
coinfloor is amazing.. the margin is a bit expensive, but the platform is great. i run a medium sized business with a large amount of free fiat and its frustrating. we know what to do and we dont feel comfortable to do so.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:57:40
i would say that!! 
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:05:03
Fundimentals built into bitcoin:
Supply of bitcoins increases at a decreasing rate as time goes on both due to halving of the mining reward every 4 years (new coins are halved) and bitcoin is lost. (bitcoin is considered deflationary unlike fiat money/$ because you cant just continually make more of it)
Demand and interest at the moment is increasing - you can see this simply by looking on google trends or looking at the number of transactions.  (there is also something called the network effect in play - ive made a youtube video for this  )
If Demand increases more quickly than supply, then price increases.  The above statements suggest that this is possible to occur.
This analysis would suggest that between $4k and $10k are the most likely values.
However the disclaimer would be that it assumes that demand would continue to increase at the same current rate - the supply part is written in stone.
Second disclaimer is that this is a chart based on a strong historical trend and as they say past performance is not necessarily an indicator of what will happen in the future.
Please make any decision to invest based on your portfolio financial risk appetite and seek further advice as this was not intended as advice to invest, rather an explination of a trend backed up by some Economics.

many thanks kind sir!!

theres a pot of gold at the end!
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:41:16
agree... the chart is not about sustainable price but about what could be possible should a bubble of the magnitude seen previously occur.  I do agree the most likely senario is $2k is the top for a while based on historical behaviour as stated.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:50:23
Hold my beer....
@_date: 2016-07-29 09:18:39
im interested because im in finance and so the concept of public ledgers is something which i find interesting anyway.  I take your point as that should be the case for any investment.  As a UK investor using £s... the GBP purchase was just another layer putting me off... along side the tech "fear" associated.  unfortunately all the wasting time cost me more than i would have liked it to! 
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:29:17


FYI i have invested £10k in bitcoin in the last 60 days.  im trying to explain what the issue is with people getting in.
Im a chartered accountant and have a masters in economics.  Jogg on you small minded uneducated little man. 
I am trying to do the opposite to what you are implying.
