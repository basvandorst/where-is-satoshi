No I know it exists... you obviously don't know about the site i linked.  The hottest girls are there and don't know about BTC.

Actually, yeah I do, ... I order hot chicks like pizza... they even deliver.

You guys don't get it... SA is perfect for network effect on hot chicks taking BTC... I cant spell it out any more plain.

Actually I'm a winner..  I'm the guy that went home and fucked the prom queen.

Your private keys are stored on the Trezor device and never touch the client running on the online computer... The client sends an unsigned transaction to the Trezor and Trezor sends back a signed transaction.  It IS cold storage with private keys never existing online.

Yup... and my chick loves it..  She's telling all her friends

Up vote this dammit!  You nerds have no idea what SA and the chicks on it knowing about BTC would do for its acceptance.  Idiots!

Trezor IS cold storage that you can freely spend from.  Theoretically you can access all of your bitcoins and spend them from a malware and virus infected computer.  The end of this video shows the Trezor setup and functionality.  I ordered one today by the way!
