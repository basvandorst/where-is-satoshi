Hmm fair enough. I was wondering if money was classed as an asset or not and if not then i think it would be wrong to take the bitcoin but if its an asset then ok

Say if you have 8 mBTC then what's this in bits?

From what I gather RT is for a foreign audience, from Russia govt POV they want to cause social unrest around the world for various reasons, maybe if there's social unrest the govts have to focus inwards rather than outwards, toward Russia. To be fair though, I like news critical of my country, Im very critical of my country and I think everyone should be critical of their respective country. This is essentially why I watch RT, but I have to have some balance so Ill watch France 24 and Euronews and sometimes but rarely all Jazeera. Try to avoid my countries news at all costs, just full of right wing bollocks promoting UKIP (they attack UKIP, voters respond sympathetically and vote for them, its psychology101.)

If not for SR bitcoin would still be worthless, face it. Besides i dont care what you do with or put in your own body and neither should anyone else.

@_date: 2014-04-15 12:05:32
Hmm maybe but better be safe.

My grandad has been asking me for ages if I want my money yet, so I took it and bought the equivalent then the price drops... always my luck, I'm in for the long haul anyway so it might pick up again although I'm not that optimistic tbh

An interesting observation Nick Szabo &gt;"shorten name to initials"&gt; N S &gt;"Reverse initials"&gt; S N &gt;"Extend name"&gt; Satoshi Nakamoto. Coincidence? I think not. EDIT: Upon further reading, somebody beat me to this observation.
