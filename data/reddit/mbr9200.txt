Sir, I am not sure where you are getting your information from. We currently have an entire web development team making a website and mobile app. We will be launching under  We have all of our software completed and we have happy customers already using our bots from our developer. We are in search for another developer. I am simply trying to hire and do not need to explain anything. I am not going to show how much capital we have or any specifics to my business model. Unless you have any actual questions rather than making random assumptions, there will be no more responses.

We are a bitcoin related startup. As stated in the post, we will launch in 5 weeks, so no there is no website up yet. Also, profitable trading can make the use of Bitcoins more enjoyable, and we have other aspects of our suite. Currently we are in search for more developers. Compensation will be spoken about further after initial email. I do not understand the skeptical attitude here. If you have genuine questions please ask and we will answer.

Yes, we are in search for another bot developer, having more than one is wise for many reasons. After googling "CryptyLabs LLC" this link came up first:  These answers should answer your questions. All of your red flags are due to incorrect assumptions. Have a nice day.

I think that their is definite risk, but I see more reasons for bitcoin to go back up rather than plummet to no value.

It's def one of the highest-tier shitcoins for sure. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:51:22
haha my buddy, Aaron Pardes, and I (Michael Rosenblat) created this in like 1-2 hours. We received some massive engagement and will add some cool (and funny) features. 
I am  on twitter. Aaron is  to see more about us. 
Open to ideas :)

It's more fun to perform simple magic tricks than it is to be some dude calling out all of his tricks.
Due to demand we will be adding some more parameters, and showing some other metrics and fun features. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:02:05
Glad you enjoyed it :D
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:02:45
Right, my buddy and I made this in literally like 1-2 hours. We'll change some things up and add some cool features as a result of this engagement...thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:31:26
Agreed, that is damn impressive. But do I think he wrote that by himself? MM..mm..mm.. NO NO NO!

Fancy 
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:01:58
Primarily market cap - but we have received massive engagement, which is great! We'll change up responses and add some cool features/metrics. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:36:16
Hey - this was just for kicks, but we have received massive engagement. We will start thinking of cool (and funny) metrics and features to show with coins. 
Open to idea! 
Chief Shithead... (eh, I'm trying it out) lol
@_date: 2018-06-15 11:49:56
I mean everything is a shitcoin is the joke - its about how not shitty your coin is....all answers are savage, but the savagery increases as it gets worse. 
Due to massive engagement we will add some cool features/metrics and such
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:13:28
Submit button added :D
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:58:53
'return' on mobile works as return as well. We will look in to this. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 11:52:26
Good idea! Any funny responses for those? Maybe i'll put in our list haha
@_date: 2018-06-15 04:11:23
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:00:51

@_date: 2018-06-16 03:02:32
Thank you :D Our newsletter will be even cooler lol The humor will show
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:57:23
Just is for Now - we're working on responses and other metrics to show. Open to any feedback 
@_date: 2018-06-15 11:51:58
We'll work on this, I just gotta pull them and reimport some stuff. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:31:05
You're about as witty as the shitcoins you hold. (lol jk) But, go look at our source code idc, it primarily sorts the coins by marketcap and has nothing to do with what we hold. 
We are adding some cool metrics soon and will do an oddly informative newsletter to start. 
Look in to our names, we've been involved in this industry for a while - Cheers!
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:55:04
Ahh...okay, thanks. We'll work on adding a button. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:08:08
