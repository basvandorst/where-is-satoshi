The US foresaw the use of gold as super conductors and wanted to make computers perhaps? Don't know and i had no clue all the gold in the US had at one point been given to our government. Makes me feel less bad about legally not having to pay taxes every year.

I get enough itemized deductions that I don't legally have to pay taxes. Technically my business losses money each year but we get by through millage and purchase deductions. If you made 80k last year but paid 35k out in labor on top of another 10-15k in supplies you don't really get taxed on much at all. Then when you divide the remainder amongst the employees it's typically low enough that you don't pay anything.
It sounds slimy and skeevy but my CPA is the one who prepares the tax stuff every year and I never pay in. Don't know what she does but we love her dearly and are grateful she is amazing at her job!

I pay sales tax and I contribute to local charities and programs that help local people. I don't have a say in how tax dollars are spent so I don't contribute as I feel my money will do more good in my community. Then there's the fact that we pay our employees double the standard rate for unskilled laybor so they can earn a livable wage Otherwise my tax dollars would go into a politician's pocket and we all deserve better than that. 
As for being a leech....well even leeches are useful. Remember when they were the miracle marvel of the medical world? :)
