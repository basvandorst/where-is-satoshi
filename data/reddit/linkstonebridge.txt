Awesome! It will be just a short survey, not more than a few questions. We will create it shortly, and make new post soon. Of course, however, the more people interested the more power we have to change the game and gain valuable information and a voice to be heard. If you can, spread the message, and hopefully we can do something amazing here soon!

Nothing! The borrower has signed protection against the event of a price decline. There will be absolutely no detriment to the borrower in this instance, and payments continue as normal. In our small test surveys, people actually insisted they be allowed to make multiple payments at this time, as making more payments at lower coin prices may increase the possibility of a larger payout at next lock in. If anything, a lower price may actually be a benefit to a borrower in the long run if historical data can be trusted.

Sure, what would you like to know?

Money is not the collateral in these cases, as the company works exactly the same as a typical mortgage company! Simply replacing fiat with crypto

Well, it works exactly the same as getting a mortgage/auto-loan currently. If a potential borrower has need for funding in order to purchase a car or house, they can get a loan with us. In a typical promissory note that one would sign for typical loans, one receives a large sum of money in exchange for a monthly payment to be made plus a little interest over time. We would offer the same thing, but with the option to make your payments via crypto currency in a direct wallet-to-wallet transaction which can be easily connected with our app. Our app will show you your loan terms, current amount remaining, next payment, and how much you have paid to date. However, here’s the twist - we keep track of your payments in crypto/USD terms, and every year we will lock in the current price at that time. If we have made profit simply by holding your coins, I.e. retention, then a percentage to be determined of that profit will actually be counted back towards your loan. For example, if over the course of a year you have paid 5 coins, let’s say all 5 of them were $1000 a coin when you bought them. When the lock in date comes, let’s say that the price is now $1500 a coin, then that means we made a profit of $2500 by means of retention. We would then take a portion of that, say 50%, and count it as payment towards your loan. This means you would have earned $1250 towards your loan at no extra cost. A win-win to both parties!

For what me and my team are trying to accomplish, these prices will actually be beneficial relatively soon. We have a solid plan going to solve the issues of usability. Hopefully I'll have good news for all of you soon.
