haha oh snap...
my recommendation would for relaitvely "cheap mining" is 2 gigabyte 7950s and a super cheap celeron processor +4gigs good ram:
that will get you about 1333Kh/s if you flash those beeches, pretty sure the new radeons do even better.
(holy fuck difficulty is at 3000+, its been awhile)
still that will make you 250 dollars in ltc a month, which is half way decent. probably more with other alts, coinchoose.com is the place to go for comparison.

that depends entirely on the financial landscape, a landscape where long-term stability is questionable to say the least.
With the whole cyprus scare, interest rates shenanigans, now HSBC requiring a statement for withdrawals over 5k, not to mention that the entire world financial system is built on fiat;
Well all of that is not very encouraging to say the least.
If you had told people BTC is going to hit 1k usd in 2013 they would have called you crazy...
I think anyone that gets into mining "seriously" is doing so with the reasoning that the value of what they have mined is going to go up in value quite severely-
hell Ive been mining in europe, I pay 0.36Usd a Kw which is fucking atrocious but I still made out like a bandit...
sure its a lot easier to just buy some paper, but if you are willing to put in some work and invest a grand or so, you just might have cemented your financial security for a very uncertain future.
I just realized the easier way of course is just to buy some fucking coin lol

Thats horrible advice for a noob, you could just mine alts with a 200€ gpu and sell for BTC
@_date: 2014-02-05 09:34:25
If you were a real punk, any kind of punk really, you wouldnt be telling other people what they should be fucking doing, you douche.
you would be doing your own thang, not giving a fuck.
I honestly cant think of one reason you would want to exclude anyone from bitcoin, regardless what views they hold.
I hereby formally invite religious extremists of every creed and color, facists, racists, politicians, mercenaries, cartel capos, kiddy-fiddlers hell even Henry Kissinger to get with the program and score some coin.

exactly, a little comparison on say coinchoose.com and a basic understanding of the field will definitely reward a player atm.

all true, but a GPU can always be used for other things and they are a lot easier to resell imo, (especially the cards with a Bios switch)
the difficulty atm really breaks my argument, it was like 1000ish a month ago asnt it?
All in all however I still think its a solid investment, coin is practically guaranteed to go up in value the way things are atm...
I bought 250€ of coin when they were at about 10€, been living off that shit since then...
you are not getting the prospect of a 100% roi anywhere else imo, unless you grow ganja or deal drugs:-)
you defintiely arent getting it from a mutual fund

Mine alts, sell for btc, profit
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:06:43
but..but.. youre helping the network!
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:54:03
you can still profit a lot more if you mine alts and *immediately* sell for BTC
Asics for the common man are basically blowing money up your ass, scrypt is pretty much the only way to go.
it is in the best interests of BTC and cryptocurrencies in general that we always have alts, for a variety of reasons.
Pretty sure most peeps understand this, LTC f.e isnt going anywhere anytime soon, alone the fact that it is scrypt will keep the network decentralized for a lot longer than BTC stays decentralized
BTC is always gonna be the big boy imo, but alts (probably even doge lolol) are going to be a part of this here dance my friend
