Why did you include the word "lovely"?  Would you include the word lovely if the article were written by a man.  This seems to belittle the effort, and further illustrates the lack of social skills found in the bitcoin community.

It's been a rough couple months over at Changetip.   Remember when [tipped $100 instead of a pizza.](

Welcome to Reddit (new user posting your first comment).  I hope you have fun here.  Some people are nice.  Just a thought for you, generally people don't like being accused of being retarded.  They also tend to respond negatively to negative comments.  Please avoid comments that are just mean and provide no real feedback or contribution to the conversation.  Thanks, and good luck redditing new user.

Probably Not...

Is this what they are calling an article?  Because this is not an article.  I get the strange feeling that Buttcoiners have taken over Here's the text:  
"Using the IBM commercial as a starting point (the one with the guy from DS9 asking about flying cars), I ask you, where is my digital cash? I remember a couple of years ago all the hype about digital money and several companies that were supposed to make a revolution in micropayment and 'secure' online purchase (i.e. anonymous). I remember Digicash as being one of the most promising companies, and I even remember downloading their digital wallet test app. It seems they went out of business and sold their patents to eCash, but now I can't even acces the eCash site. Does anyone know if there are other projects like this (still alive), and/or Open Source alternatives? Digital money should be a reality by now."

As says below


The marketing practices that changetip has exhibited in the past are the main reason I have to question this move.  I have much respect for mod I appreciate your work for I am just concerned that a company might be trying to influence the type of content that appears here.  Please continue to make the distinction between mod and changetip employee as clear as possible.  I think a disclaimer would help to illustrate what party you are speaking for, but does not fully address the issue.  Thank you for your response and for communicating in an open and clear manner.  Cheers.

Bitcoin will be the premier currency in the future.  People will use litecoin as a transaction medium, but their savings will be in Bitcoin.  It will be rare for someone to own more than one Bitcoin, as one Bitcoin will be very expensive.

Maybe Bitcoin Lost Your Number.

It was suggested to [here]( that he create an account that is called and use that for changetip business.  This makes a lot of sense to me and would eliminate much of the confusion as to whether he is posting as a mod or for changetip or just to post.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:42:00
So if Changetip was charging a 1% fee on withdrawals and everyone who tipped withdrew all their Bits, Changetip would have made a total monthly revenue of $123.15 USD.

Why is a mod commenting on behalf of Changetip?  This sure is confusing.  
If these stats are "largely inaccurate", please provide accurate statistics. I would love to see them.

I started out trying to find information about them for a paper I was writing.  As I found out more and more, I discovered questionable business practices, wild attempts at viral marketing, and an overall lack of transparency.  This was odd for such prevalent company in the space, so I felt that I had to share the data that I did find with the people.  Since, I started sharing data, I have found downvotes, and negative comments tend to accompany my posts, which to me just means that I'm doing something right.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:13:54
If you were colorblind to greens and blues you would not be able to tell the difference between the mod and the changetip employee.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:10:16
I checked this a little while ago, and my post had been removed.  Very suspicious, considering that happened right after Bashco commented on this thread.  
Edit:  It is back now.

The Data comes from scraping a public feed that Changetip broadcasts.  It contains data about the public accounts on Changetip.

I wish I could throw around money like Nick does.  Make it rain!
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:05:11
The data is from sources that are available publicly.  I would love to see more in depth data, and also more reliable data.  This is the best data I have access to.  The paper is for my 101A Microeconomic Analysis for Business Decisions class for my undergraduate degree in Business Administration.  Thanks for your response.  I only wish you would have responded to my original requests.  It would have avoided a lot of confusion.  Cheers.

Hahahaaha.  Waiting for that headline.  Wouldn't be too surprising.  
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:40:46
I made it through one whole minute of that.  Can I get my minute back please?
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:10:54


We'll see.  I feel that I phrased things appropriately, presented facts, and only facts, and posed questions.  Don't Taze me Bro!
 
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:15:35
Citation?  
(gotta ask for facts, right?)  
With all this confusion over the statistics from your company.  Will you be publishing statistics about your company soon?  If so, when?  If not, why not?

You mean I'm not getting 100,000 dollars for putting up the transfer fee for Prince Amatupu?  Damn!
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:03:22
At current prices, that's more than $4,700 USD.  Why would Changetip need to move their money around publicly?  If this was some sort of internal transfer, they could have just used Bitcoin.  They didn't have to tip eachother in public.  The only reason that this transfer would occur on their public ledger, is if they wanted to have the appearance of increased BTC volume.  But why would they want the appearance of increased BTC volume?  Hmmmm.

Thanks for the official response.  The paper may or may not include changetip at this point.  I am finding it quite difficult to find meaningful stats.  The stats I would like to see are the ones I thought I found.  Can you provide statistics about, Total tip amounts for the last month in USD and BTC, Total number of tips, Median Tip amount, and How many unique tippers?  
@_date: 2015-03-20 22:16:02
I know who I am.

That's funny, I was just trying to find out about Changetip for a paper I'm writing about startups.
