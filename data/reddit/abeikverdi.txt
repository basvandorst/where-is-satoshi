Based on which metrics bitFlyer is counted as the largest exchange in the world? Such a big claim!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:12:20
So you have to remember if your coins are on GDAX, it means that you dont really own them and its GDAX that's managing your coins. As far as I know, they do not credit your Bitcoin Cash etc to your account yet so there is no way to get your other coins until they change their policy and start supporting other coins.

Wait for a year or two. If it becomes successful it will add the same KYC requirement. Stop that decentralized crap. All it takes to bring this service down is for the government to shut down their service. Then they wont be there to sign the multig tx and now any conflict between the counterparties wont be resolved. End of the story.

Great to hear that from your experience! I am thinking to do both of them. A physical ATM makes sense to normal people and more understandable. Ill try for the best.
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:43:34
Convincing the Iranian government for a one way ATM is quite simple. There are more than enough incentives for them to give permission for that. I am not entirely sure about two ways one!

Trust me in Iran since there are not so mny alternatives, foreigners and also local people would love that especially in the airport. A two way physical ATM is something that people can easily trust.
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:38:32
Im working on the ATM thing! Possible we are thinking to start as a one way ATM like a vending machine.
Its great to hear that you can receive Toman in Kuwait. Are you willing to invest on Bitcoin in Iran as an exchange?
@_date: 2014-11-30 11:34:44
Thats what Im working on. Currently I'm in the process of getting a legal certificate from the airport.
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:42:12
Thats entirely true. Regardless of politics that always target normal citizens, a decentralized network can be the true democracy and that's exactly what Bitcoin is offering in my opinion!
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:54:48
Oh really? So those oldcoins are owned by Hal Finney? Can I have a reference link for that?
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:34:22
Thats exactly what I also thought of! It can be advertised as an anti USD currency! If there are good incentives on BTC for Iranian government, it wouldnot be impossible that Iranian banks and government invest on it!

Yea I am aware of that. It can be a good opportunity for any businesses obviously.

What do you mean by that? The ATM itself or trading with ATMs? Can you elaborate a bit more?
@_date: 2014-11-30 14:20:47
yea! not that bad! It doesn't exactly matter how much 1 Toman is. The thing that matters is what you can do with 1 Toman in Iran. Practically with even 1000 Toman you can't buy anything these days. So 1 million Toman is something that people deal with all the time. Everyone is a millionaire. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 11:42:52
Thats right. Reliability is really important since many people in Iran havent heard or used Bitcoin and the first impression is really important.
@_date: 2014-11-30 11:31:39
Yea.. I realized that once I saw its 999 USD price. And also this project sky hook is really small which is not really good for an airport or other public places. This Santo-tirso looks legit. If they accept Iranian currency that would be the way to go!

I meant 25BTC that is given to miners once block is generated. I am not talking about the 6 confirmations thing by Satoshi. But anyway thanks for your reply.
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:36:52
Technically in Iran there has always been another term which is widely used in the country called Toman. 1 Toman = 10 Rial. If you ever travel to Iran no one practically uses Rial anywhere. I guess 1 BTC = 1 million Toman is not that bad!

Can this solve the micropayment channel problem? How does it solve the malleability problem in micro-payment channel?
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:39:27


The nonce as far as I am concerned is 32 bits which gives me about 2^32 different options which is roughly around 4 billion which is 4*10^9. With my laptop hashrate I can get 20*10^6 hashes per second. Isnt the nonce too small? We definitely need to change other attributes in the header as well during mining especially if we are an ASIC miner.
@_date: 2015-01-21 09:23:55
Who do we send this proof of work at the end? (Regardless of the fact that we created merkle root with this approach) 
Pool organizers!!
Therefore they will have control over it in the final broadcast of the block and adding it to the blockchain. Otherwise once I find the nonce, Ill just claim it myself rather than sharing with other miners in the mining pool.
The concept of mining pool doesnt get along as long as we have a centralized organizer.
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:39:51
Can you elaborate? Why don't they increase the share threshold then?
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:41:38
Thats right! For sure they are gonna try to create a similar concept of Bitcoin on fiat currencies! Thats the only way bank can survive in future
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:41:41
cuz you wont get any share?
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:42:22
Also I found that there is a P2Pool.org which apparently is different.

@_date: 2015-01-21 08:28:08
Getblocktemplate seems to be a nice protocol solving some issues of mining pools. It still doesnt address all the problems but obviously it will be a good practice for miners to get involved in the block creation themselves rather than blindly working in mining pools.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:44:26
You can do that but the technology is still there.. First of all you cant buy all the Bitcoin even if you want to. Many people dont wanna share their Bitcoin basically and secondly, as far as I can see, the price of Bitcoin is beyond the supply and demand.. there are so many psychological effects and ...
@_date: 2015-01-21 06:54:56
I exactly thought about the same thing! Once BTC value dropped last couple of weeks ago, I kinda felt that this can be good for a decentralization in mining.
There is one idea that I've been thinking on to solve this but Im not sure how practical it would be, is to create a multisig account for each mining pool and think of mining pool as a decentralized autonomous corp (DAC) which distribute the reward (25BTC) based on miners shares itself. Its too abstract though but ideally it would work.
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:07:41
Why should I use a centralized coinbase while I have PayPal? I don't see anything interesting in it.
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:33:24
I think another problem is that people can start making mining pool in the nodes of P2P to make the most shares! So we go back to the same problem!

Fair point
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:08:33
yea you are right! So why dont they reduce the difficulty for each share? so rather than each 30 sec lets say miners create a share every 5 seconds. Then the number of rejected blocks would reduce as well.

Thats correct. Iran is quite complicated. I don't think you can summarize its political situation in few sentences.
@_date: 2019-11-17 12:43:45
US has been putting a lot of pressure on Iran and is playing a weird game so this is not a coincidence. However the locals are not really satisfied with whats going on in the country and has been protesting for a while in smaller scale. The regime has gone iron fist multiple times to stop the protests over the last decade so it's not really something new. The extent that they went is too far this time though which is unprecedented.
At the very least this also shows the capabilities that governments have when it comes to dealing with internet which is the most fundamental technology we are taking for granted in most of other recent inventions including Bitcoin.

What does CSV stand for?
@_date: 2016-12-13 05:37:04
Channels always have a fixed lifetime. You make an nlock tx back to yourself from the 2of2 multisig. Every LN channel have an expiry date.

@_date: 2016-12-14 06:01:03
Money is money. If you cant use it to buy coffee then its not really that useful. Our goal should always be to scale the system to a certain level that can be used by everyone for everything as long as it does nor change its permission less nature. Bitcoin has scalability issues and its understandable that we can't buy coffee with it now. But someday we will be able to.
@_date: 2019-06-02 01:22:37
How are they randomly selected? Is it deterministic?
I can pay more to the arbitrator to get the money without paying the counterparty. It overall seems like a very broken model. Not only its slow, manual but it also doesnt scale and is easy to break from what I see.
@_date: 2019-06-01 08:39:49
Haha.. ok ok its decentralized because they say so.
Bisq is basically a localbitcoins without running a server. It would not however work without the intermediary that handles the resolution. Bisq takes one key of the multisig and in case one party does not behave properly, they take actions. It is not anonymous either since there is bank transfer etc. All in all, it is not a decentralized exchange and wouldnt work without the escrow bisq in the middle. Do educate yourself first before spreading false claims.

Seems like that pure idealogical trustless money is getting centralized.
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:14:15
A private key generates a unique public key and address is generated from that public key. Public key is basically a coordinate on the elliptic curve and some points are not on curve so no matter what private key you choose they dont make that point on curve. 2 different private keys make two different identical public keys but might make the same address. Keep in mind that when you send a transaction you need to send its public key with the transaction along with the signature.
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:14:27
Who are the arbitrators? And how can I trust them? What if they collide with one party to make a little money? What's their incentive to do this?
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:19:22
Private key is a scalar number between 0 to 2^256. Public key is a coordinate that can be calculated from private key times the generator point (Generator G is constant). so lets say private key is 2 then public key will be 2*G = G + G which gives public key coordinate. There are so many coordinates that are not on the curve which means that these coordinates do no corresponds to any private keys therefore the calculated address of them does not correspond to a private key. There is one argument though, that the address space is smaller than private key but that necessarily doesnt prove that any address can have a private key. There might be many addresses that can be unlocked by different private keys. Hope this explanations helps.
@_date: 2015-08-03 10:03:51
What you said is not totally accurate. Not every private key has a public key. Some public keys are not a point on elliptic curve therefore they dont have any private keys like the address you mentioned and thus cant be spent. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 15:05:45
Theoretically there might be but chances of finding one is literally none.
@_date: 2015-08-04 00:03:23
Its correct. Public key = private key * generator. Generator is a point and private key is a number. Lets say private key is 2. Then public key will be 2*G which is G+G. So in order to calculate public key you should add generator points to each other private key times.

@_date: 2015-07-23 04:47:00
Thanks for your sincere opinion. 
I'm personally only a bitcoin fan but at the same time I think its important to embrace new technologies that can help the current system at some point. Altcoins are generally pump and dump but few have introduced interesting technical points and I, as a master of computer science, who has done his master thesis on bitcoin, after reading NEM's technical reference found some of their work fascinating. Such as their reputation based protocol for incentivizing their harvesters. I have written pros and cons of NEM previously and you can refer to that.
Once you have enough knowledge and information about their system, you can come back to this post and we can discuss further.

mining is not really centralized. With good protocols you can make it more decentralized. That's something that has been happening.
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:33:27
Perfect idea for developers. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 05:46:20
Yea I see your point. Well technically bitcoin doesnt solve the problem of a richman gets richer. You clearly can make more and more mining facilities and start to making it decentralized. But at the very least it gives this opportunity for everyone to participate.
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:05:51
Bitcoin is just a technology and just like any other technologies it has its own cons! Its like saying internet helps drug dealers to sell drugs easier!
@_date: 2016-10-10 05:25:59
Yes. That address is yours. Electrum doesnt want you to see that cuz they want to force you to use a new address every time you receive coins which is a good practice. But if you want to send BTC to your old address and spend it later its absolutely possible and Electrum keeps all your previous private keys for old addresses.
@_date: 2016-10-16 03:45:33

MimWim requires huge modifications in bitcoin. MimWim doesn't use Bitoins Script language anymore.  Different concept of inputs and outputs. You need to add a "k" value to the whole transaction which changes transsaction construction entirely. The whole transaction verification is also different. It can only be a sidechain of bitcoin. There is no way for bitcoin to integrate that in its core.
@_date: 2015-03-04 11:19:21

@_date: 2017-05-07 04:32:57
In an ideal world yea.But practically it has a wrong incentive structure. You give all the money upfront and once all the coins are distributed the original founder has no incentive to build anything cuz he wouldn't gain much after all. So the whole point of using money as a motivation to build a project gets lost there. That being said there still would be people who are able to build something meaningful without raising a single penny such as Satoshi himself.
What we ended up having with these ICOs now is bunch of scammers using this as an opportunity to scam people with very fuzzy, futuristic ideas and promises with very little to no innovation.

@_date: 2015-03-29 02:31:28
Where can I find the report? BBC didnt reference to that and I couldnt find it on google.
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:35:21
I actually think Ethereum is he biggest scam of all. :D
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:59:14
Have you tried it? What are your first impressions?
@_date: 2015-02-05 11:47:31
Fair point
@_date: 2015-03-29 10:44:48

If you use the same key with the same private key twice. Anyone can find your private key. Pay attention ANYONE! since there are two equations with the formulas. If you like to read more about it. Have a look at ECDSA sign generation algorithm.

Hash function is deterministic and its results is totally random but with the same input it always generates the same output. So if we use the private key and concatenate it with transaction hash and hash them together, we will get that random number k that RFC 6979 describes. Assuming no one knows our private keys, then without relying on random number generator, we can create that random number k deterministically.

Keep it up. Sooner or later, people will realize about this technology.
Good luck on your studies!
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:56:32
There is enough information out there about drugs and who they can harm your body. I don't see enough information about scam ICOs though. That's why I think its necessary to speak up.
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:30:50
Bitcoin is more than just a currency!
@_date: 2015-11-16 16:47:02
There were some technical issues due to a heavy traffic. Its working fine right now.
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:24:01


@_date: 2017-05-07 03:05:17
Its kinda similar in a sense. But at least there is a product in case of IPOs. All you see in an ICO is a sleek and smart website with a whitepaper.
@_date: 2015-02-17 07:11:32
Good point. But the way it actually really works is that some Banks in Iran establish a branch in another country. lets say UAE, Qatar or Cyprus and the main branch in Iran issue Iranian people credit cards from those branches. Downside is that Iranians should pay a really high fee for such a service!
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:02:38
So is Vatican a country?
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:18:40
And what did you reply?
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:32:46
Isle of man has been open to crypto currency for quite a while! This  specific link is a new news from their electronic business chief! If you feel like those government related news are not propaganda this is a link for you then: 
@_date: 2015-02-13 00:38:57
Its how the world works. I think he is dumb. He thinks I am dumb but in reality both of us are dumb!
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:23:38
this is a cool idea but as you said I think it doesnt get along with ISPs easily!
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:24:41
Totally agree with this! I see so many examples of these dumb people all the time.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:13:50
Is there any link describing how this multisig exactly works? I tried to find it but couldn't find anything technical!
@_date: 2015-02-04 10:40:43
Its the same. Can you define a country then?
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:51:07
I see. I totally got it now. I wish you could right this somewhere for others future reference. The multi-sig concept is not well-explained anywhere else and they only explained a broad concept of it.
BTW do miners accept these kinds of not standard looking transactions? Probably these transactions require more memory as well? Am I right?
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:41:04
Its gonna be amazing if they do. Looking forward..
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:08:39
One thing that I can think of is using this concept in secure [multi party computations]( and this feature looks like a promising revolution for the set of problems in MPC. Solving distributed voting problem or gambling issue. Am I right?
The only thing that I have limited knowledge of now is to what extend this Bitcoin script can support developers? Probably the script itself will create many restrictions. Time to read more about it.
But thanks again for your detailed answer.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:07:04
Seems like its easier for a theif to steal a Bitcoin ATM. Normally they are lighter and less secure. Its gonna gradually become a trend I guess.
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:12:23
I mean yea..  that's too ideal! We gotta start from something!
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:16:45
They just saw the Bitcoin's community and its potential and its a really good option for a small society like isle of man. I guess thats a wise decision after all. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 02:40:25
Nice explanation. May I know whether multisig is built based on ssss? Which cryptographic asymetric key exchange is used? With normal ECDSA we have one private and one public key so this multi sig should probably use a different algorithm.
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:23:03
Are people still struggling what a country is?! Come on.. It's just a term that governments use to differentiate between US and THEM! literally it doesnt make any sense in a distributed decentralized world! 
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:06:15
I understand that its a standard. Adding private key to the generation of random number doesn't introduce any overhead or any problem?
@_date: 2015-02-03 03:00:43
Another thing to ask is that whether multisig only applies in Bitcoin or not? When I google multisig all I get is bitcoin related. Do we have this concept out of Bitcoin's scope?
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:31:12
There is no such a thing as decentralized P2P exchange!
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:36:31
Yea.. you are right! These days the Bitcoin ATMs look kinda fancy though.. and I actually like that
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:03:54
Price doesn't represent anything and I don't think a ponzi scheme attracting a lot of investors is something we should care about.
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:53:18
You have the right to invest in whatever you want and no on is stopping you. I also have the right to tell you my opinion and if that makes any sense to you, it could change your mind. It's called being civil and sharing thoughts in a civilized manner without being disrespectful.
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:47:46
What do you consider a user? Anyone with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:06:37
I think that's pretty much it! And they are so open to new technologies and are willing to tax cryptocurrency startups reasonably
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:21:05
A self-governing British Crown dependency! Happy now?
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:15:32
Free market. Maybe just maybe not everyone is capable of understanding elliptic curve cryptography and managing his/her private keys.
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:50:35
I asked it in /cryptography but no one replied. Thought bitcoiners can answer.
