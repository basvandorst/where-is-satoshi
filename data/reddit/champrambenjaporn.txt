they have literally thousands of people paid to do manual quality control and conflict resolution and margins are used for geo specific property marketing, and then there is the whole data targeting stuff. it would take a supremely sophisticated app to simulate a cross border economy to unseat airbnb

branding though.  less than 1% of people use bitcoin and even less people know what a satoshi is. suggesting the crypto community shift to an unknown new icon and educating people that its a fractional bitcoin ... why.   it makes more sense to call satoshis "bitcoins" and a whole bitcoin ... "a whole bitcoin"
