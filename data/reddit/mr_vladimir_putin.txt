9:00 Completement opaque, anonyme, intracable.. C'est bien un économiste 
parle d'une technologie. Bitcoin est completement transparent, 
pseudoanonyme, et traçable. À un point tel que ses utilisateurs doivent se 
protéger pour éviter que d'autres utilisateurs n'espionnent leurs paiements 
publiquement. L'argent liquide correspond mieux à la définition utilisée 
ici pour instaurer une peur non justifiée envers Bitcoin.

imo, if it's not PHYSICAL gold, it's not worth diddly...

This was recorded at a little Trezor demonstration at the hamburg Bitcoin 
meetup (btchamburg.com). It shows how the user can prove to the device 
knowledge of the PIN without the (possibly compromised) host machine 
gaining any knowledge of that PIN although it is being used to enter it.
This is done by the device showing a shuffled PIN entry keyboard and the 
user entering it on a unlabeled keyboard on the host computer.

The insidious agenda fuelled MSM reporting should not surprise to smart 
people, but that is the state of the world. Ross allegedly ran something 
that, if caught would only lead to a serious consequence (Ross is surely no 
fool). I have no reason to think that Ross is not a nice guy (although I'm 
not well researched). I would rather support people who really want to get 
off drug addiction than support Ross. It is a matter of ones priorities. 
I've had numerous ties to addicted people over the years. The very room I'm 
in now as a write this was trespassed by addicts who were stealing from the 
house at night while people were sleeping. There are so many addicts in my 
area, that I'd hidden stuff so they would overlook it. Such is life!.

Good luck dissociating the currency and the payment system.
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:51:01
Perfect! Good lu

I like the reporter, she doesn't sound like most reportes who have 
absolutely no idea what their talking about.
@_date: 2014-03-26 21:02:42
Well put. He talks very fast though
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:51:15
I like stefan, he has that likable personality, he need to do more talks :)

I once had a dream that giraffes ate windmills
Then I woke up and made this account.

Funny how he downplays money yet debt is a very real and scary thing. Sell 
them Bitcoin's.

Missing all the videos about 3D printing, you guys got your FFL though 
didn't youl?

VIVE LA FUCKING FRANCE!

Another example of Bitcoin spurring "Innovation at the edges" - in this 
case, for those who opt into using the BitcoinJ wallet.

A refleshingly honest altcoin launch. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:34:44
Thanks for the review! Sorry the machine wasn't working at first- looks 
like it was a wifi connection issue, which is why you didn't see the 
buy/sell price on the top right side of the screen at first.
Hope your launch goes well! Good Luck!

I can answer that for her, "why is this happening to your son" because 
there are bullies in positions of power, kind of reminds me of Aron 
Schwartz and/or Barrett Brown
@_date: 2014-04-22 09:14:37
Stefan, again you continually mix up fiat currency, and debt based

Anyone who is wondering anything at all about bitcoin - how it works, what 
are its (potential) uses, its benefits and disadvantages, should check out 
the freakonomics podcast on bitcoin. I listened to it and I listened to it 
5 times after. It was so enriching.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:46:36
Looks kickass! Hope Apple doesn't get in the way.

Exchanging and transferring are 2 different things.
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:58:47
The whole video (along with the rest in the series) is worth watching, but 
this segment here offers an especially lucid explanation of the mechanism 
behind the process of exchanging public keys.
EDIT: Seems G  doesn't preserve the time parameter when previewing youtube 
links. Segment in question can be found here:  Gambling with Secrets: Part 
7/8 (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange)
