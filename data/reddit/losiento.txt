Really sorry to hear that, sure sucks when you have a bitcoin loss however it happens.

This plan:
1. Let it fork.
2. Stop using Bitcoin.
3.  Wait.
4. Wait some more.
5. When the fork is resolved and there is one winning chain you can start using it again.
Note price may be highly volatile and look like it is dropping rapidly. You have to resist the temptation to trade or sell out / rebuy. You have to simply HODL and wait.
Any other strategy is highly risky. Some may try to play (the gamblers amongst us) but many will lose everything.
TLDR: Keep your head and HODL.

Sorry to hear of your unexpected loss from your hodling.
Perhaps a more trustworthy reliable exchange will be better.

Is this to be a UK exchange ?

I am sure most of us know how to surf around reddit and look at all the other Bitcoin related subs in order to get a taste of *different* censorship rules. Maybe somewhere there is even a sub that is open and fair with no censorship but don't forget to check out the mods carefully. (due diligence/research on google/etc).

It's an experiment in e-cash /cryptocurrency running for 6+ years now. Clearly there are problems e.g. mining power. It needs work to make it suitable for "the people". Unfortunately the recent debate and shenanigans surrounding such basic improvements as scaling up transaction capability do not bode well for the future.

To avoid loss of expensive primary coolant (Novec type) processors need to be hermetically sealed . Challenging technically and added expense. Note that running temperature for all electronic components will exceed the boiling point on Novec in equilibrium conditions i.e. 48 degrees and this will result in shortened life.

It is fundamental to the nature of Bitcoin (and indeed all altcoins too) that a hard fork is always possible at any time.
Satoshi designed it that way and it pretty well has to be so if you have a P2P distributed trustless system. What happens when one occurs depends primarily on the miners and eventually one side must win and the other lose, in other words there is always a resolution to a single blockchain. The problem is that while the miners "decision making" takes place the utility of the e-cash is seriously compromised, i.e. you won't want to use it if there is a risk you might be on the losing chain. Again this is a fundamental feature of Satoshi's design.
Looking to the future it is very likely something similar will crop up again. some thought should be given to the long term implications of anything that is decided now about block size alterations. Maybe the focus should be on incentivising the miners to come to a very rapid decision in the case of a hard fork.

1. Someone posts in stating their bitcoin balance has *mysteriously* disappeared.
2. Someone posts on stating that they think a bitcoin company has *stolen* their funds.
3. Someone posts on stating that their Trezor won't work properly.
4. Someone posts on about a great new company where you can earn over 100% per annum on your bitcoins.
5. achieves a negative down vote of over 1000 on some erudite comment about so called censorship.
6. gets a 7 day ban for pointing out a FACT about something bitcoin related.

Errant spike caused by random lucky quick finding of several blocks. Note graph is reverse calculated from average block generation times and not from any specifically reported data pertaining to actual computing power in use.
Hence deceptive. Wait a few days, it will settle to the average again.

1. Bad things happen. This is good for bitcoin because reasons.
2. Good things happen. This is good for bitcoin because
3. Nothing happens. This is good for bitcoin because stability.

Yeah, 'cos there is no need for any kind of insurance when it is parked up is there ?
Seriously when an insurance guy comes up with such a retared piece of shit as that comment we wonder why the little fucker has not been sacked already. I seriously despair. No fucking idea !!

Hi, and thank you for your inquiry. In order to understand the risks involved in using Bitcoin you need to understand two basic fundamental things;
1. Bitcoin is effectively digital CASH. It was designed as such and has this feature together with its advantages AND disadvantages.
2. Understand all the previous methods by which users have been scammed. Go through your bitcoin history books and research all the scams.
Fundamentally if you use a system which is digital cash, with no chargebacks and no third party security/backup, there is no 100% safe way to ensure you don't get scammed UNLESS you get the goods before you pay. The whole thing when using digital cash (Bitcoin) for any type of on line purchase or service (e.g. a mixer) relies upon trusting that the other side acts honestly. 
This is, in a sense, doubly ironic. Firstly from the point that Satoshi designed it as a "trustless" system and secondly that a high percentage of users are using it with vendors of illegal/immoral stuff in DMs who are not renowned for their "honesty". 
Finally may I point out that Bitcoin is far from anonymous in its "straight" use and only by the careful and continued use of mixers can you approach anonymity. BTW do you know (for sure !) which of all the current Bitcoin mixer services do (or do not) send data to the NSA and GCHQ ?

1. Cook your evening meal in a slow cooker hidden in the filing cabinet.
2. Take some hot water bottles in to work and fill them from the office kettle just before you leave.
3. Buy a Tesla and a long extension lead, possibly disguise cable by running it down the middle of a hosepipe.
