Are you the original uploader that posted this last week or an imposter copying pasta this?!?!
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:43:09
perhaps not directly with bitcoin but enough for the down payment of a house
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:32:45
i guess you're better off asking this question in @_date: 2017-09-05 03:31:18

@_date: 2017-09-18 19:15:10
thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:44:51
If we all knew about future price we would be rich. No one knows what's going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:28:11
would it also be fine if i just kept it on gemini? would they be able to handle the situation? or would you still recommend moving it to a wallet for this occasion?
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:53:08
you know of any guide on how to take the key from electrum and import it somewhere else? I read that its better to sweep than to import, could you possibly explain this?
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:12:34
how long has it been since you last emailed them?
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:00:51
thanks for the info. I think i'm gonna go with desktop wallet and I just want to hold on to them in a wallet in case of a fork or some other crisis. I'm probably gonna go with Electrum unless you guys think it's bad
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:57:28
don't bank on it, be smart about it. take your coins off of coinbase so you don't come back here making a post saying you lost your money.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:00:15
He didn't follow the 1 simple rule.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:58:31
know any tutorials for storing coins in wallet with private keys? or is it simply just moving it to a wallet like electrum?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:55:30
Yes we know. Just look at recent posts.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:08:27
the man has a point. There have been tons and tons of posts asking the same question you are. In the time you wrote this post, you could have easily found your answer.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:18:17
if you buy btc, yes move it to electrum. yes it's safe. You definitely don't want to keep it on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:44:14
I've had a very good experience with Gemini so far. Easy to buy and sell. Don't have many bad things to say about it.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:16:55
oh boy. they have always replied to me after 2-3 days but a week is way too long. I don't know any number :/
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:46:48

@_date: 2017-06-14 13:55:19
