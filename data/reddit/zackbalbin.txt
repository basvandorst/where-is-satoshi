You can send and receive yes, but you don’t own the keys.
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:43:38
Not worth it to try to time the market.

Big oof
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:12:06
With any investment you should only put in what you are comfortable losing.
@_date: 2019-07-23 06:48:30
You do NOT own your private keys on Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:46:57
Leave satoshi alone

The fact that a company might fail is not a strong argument for staying away from investing. Yes you have to be smart with the stocks you buy, and even be smart with BTC. I am an investor and believer in BTC however, I won’t put all of my capital into it. There’s a possibility that a company could fail and then the stock is worthless and there’s a possibility that the BTC network could be rendered useless causing BTC to be worthless.

I mean I still believe in diversifying and having stocks. Saying stocks will go away is like saying that no companies with exist

Saying that stocks are overvalued because they serve as a way to protect wealth from inflation is like saying that Bitcoin is overvalued cause it can protect from inflation as well. 
Stocks aren’t just good for fighting inflation. They have other attributes too. It’s like saying Bitcoin is only good as a store of value. There are other benefits to BTC like granting the ability for people to transact without a centralized institution or government allowing or blocking the transaction.

Them contact, if mistake you think it is

Don’t quote me, but I am pretty sure one is under development.
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:07:34
Those are futures.
@_date: 2019-11-06 18:07:29
There are options on futures. They act they same way but instead of stock it’s with the individual futures contracts.
@_date: 2019-03-06 02:12:51
Eventually yes.

Change your perspective. BTC is the stable asset, everything else is not.
@_date: 2019-08-11 06:50:41
Coinbase, cash app both these would work fine
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:00:22
No max. Just stacking sats

Idk about a credit card that does that but there’s a browser extension that gives BTC back on purchases called Lolli
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:30:41
Apparently currency does not equal money
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:35:41
Very true.

He runs a mining farm and always provides good information about crypto currency.
@_date: 2019-10-15 21:06:24
@_date: 2019-06-10 02:02:36
Not anymore
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:08:53
Looks like coinbase pro
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:12:10
Better off just buying BTC
@_date: 2019-10-27 01:45:19
It would have to be a global EMP in order to take the Bitcoin network offline.
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:35:49
In my book, its not dropping. 1 BTC still equals 1 BTC.
@_date: 2019-12-29 22:31:06
Love to hear it.
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:29:02
Hodl 
@_date: 2019-09-25 03:18:02
Its for institutions
@_date: 2019-09-11 05:14:04
Only put what you are willing to lose. Same with any other investment.
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:05:33
Timing this market is extremely tough. Only invest what you feel comfortable.
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:31:19
It’s a trap!
@_date: 2019-09-08 02:52:53
My guess is Bakkt
