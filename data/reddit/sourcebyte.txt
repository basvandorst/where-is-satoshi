I thought i read that theyve already tested their network without it, theyre just keeping for the time being until there are enough nodes to protect it from spamming zero cost txs.

I say wait until right before 'IT' is released to dvd. Bitcoin really started climbing when IT was released in theaters. When the dvd comes out I expect it to increase 403.73%, plateau for 11 days and then climb another 220.23%.

You are confused again. You are comparing a bakery that is refusing to provide a service that they advertised they could provide(CUSTOM,ORIGINAL, ONE OF A KIND,CAKES) to a deli being forced to provide a service they have never advertised. There is an ocean between forcing a deli to provide something they have never offered, and telling a bakery they cant deny service....based on race, religion, sex, or sexuality(note that they still have every right to refuse service if the customer is being rude, or literally any OTHER reason for that matter). Forcing muslims to provide non HALAL meat is not even remotely analogous; the supreme court would never hear a case arguing that a wheel and tire shop should be offering back massages to its customers too. The errors you dont see in your comparisons are the reason you dont understand an opposing point of view.

You are confusing the issue. Grossly. There is a difference between telling a business that they need to provide all possible services to all people all the time and then telling a business that they can do whatever they want....- they just cant turn anyone away for discriminatory reasons. A good way of determining that would be to ask yourself if you had no knowledge of the race, gender, age, sexuality, or religion of your customer would that have changed the way you treated them? In the cake incident, the answer to that is obviously a yes. Therefore its discriminatory. Dont argue against a position nobody holds. Winning an argument against yourself doesnt make you right.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:34:11
That is a very short sighted point of view. You are thinking in terms of one cake, one couple, one instance, allowing someone to discriminate because their interpretation of the bible(which is not shared by everyone) sets a dangerous precendent for the rest of our society. Its the governments job to think about how allowing discrimination based on sexual orientation due to a religious view point will effect the rest of our society; and it becomes a very slippery slope deciding what kind of discrimination is acceptable and whats not; (ex: why is religious discrimination sanctioned and not racial?, can a protestant hang signs that say no catholics allowed?) Is it fair to allow one religion to discriminate without others being allowed to exercise the same freedom? Thats not to say that a law will bring all discrimination to a hault anyway, but at least it has a chance of minimizing it.

If you ask 10 different people why the price of anything goes up and down you will get 10 different answers. Sure there is a tendency by some of us to fall victim to conspiracies of one man controlling everything, or one company's sole responsibility for price swings and but thats not to say some of those theories could be right too. Im not saying they are but dont rule them out just because they seem unlikely. Look at Mcaffe s effect on the price of alt coins shortly after his daily/weekly coin suggestions. Like you i am invested in several coins and hope they all do well. After all its this kind of competition that is supposed to be great for everyone.....roger ver though....thats a tough pill to swallow. Trying to coopt the name of another coin is ridiculous.

This is what people like him do. There's no way to discredit the efforts of a charities like these so he takes his argument to the extreme and argues against a position nobody holds in the first place to make himself feel like hes right. His argument boils down to, "well if these charities are so great why arent they helping everyone everywhere at tha same time, in amounts proportional to their need?" Obviously there are several barriers to this impossible standard, and an argument nobody has ever made for any charities capacity to help in the first place, but people like him arent interested in discussing how to make things better with constructive criricism, only how to make themselves feel right by arguing a position nobody is arguing against in the first place.

Lol it has nothing to do with WHAT they arent getting....its WHY they arent getting it. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:08:53
If you didnt understand what I said earlier there's no reason to expect you will understand anything else on the topic, but I will try to explain it as simply as I can. In your example the customer is turned away because the shop they are going to doesnt offer the product they asking for. So they are being denied due to product UNAVAILABILITY. If you went to a ford dealership expecting a Lamborghini you'd be in for the same surprise and nobody would take that case to the supreme court lol or maybe you would. In the cake example, the CUSTOM cakes are ON THE MENU, so the customers are being denied not for WHAT they are asking for, but for WHO they are. 
Lol i will certainly agree with your very last point though.

Hes knows exactly what hes doing, he preying on the ignorance of people just joining the crypto world. When cryptos compete against each other with new technology everyone wins, when someone puts his coin up for sale under the name of a more popular first to market coin, in an effort to get business from people who may think BCASH is just more bitcoin thats fraud.

I hear what you're saying. People OUGHT to do their due diligence in everything they do. BUT, dont know about you, ive noticed that apathy in the US is a huuuuge problem. And anecdotally, i can tell you in the last year ive spent so much time researching every facet of my life it WOULDNT hurt anything to sticky so information for newcomers to make life a little easier. Examples? Ive had to research and diagnose my own recent health issue, diagnose and fix my pwn car troubles, connectivity issues, plumbing issues, electrical...and on and on. Apathy permeates the private sector. All anyone cares about is money. And when you have to be your own doctor, mechanic, electrician, plumber etc...how much time do you have to spend everywhere else? What could making helpful information easier to find hurt anyone?

I wouldnt put anything in you're  not comfortable with losing. I put in 2k but only because when considering my options; putting into the stock market and taking 20yrs to get a good return, putting into a savings or cd with low interest rates and getting 20 dollars every 6 mos. , or putting it in my mattress and losing money to inflation; risking 2k and potentially making 2 more relatively quick didnt sound so bad. Ive spent 2k in dumber ways. But if 2k is going to hurt you, put it into something else.

Im a bit confused about the btc vault. If you put in say half a bitcoin valued at 3k, then the price of bitcoin quadruples and you decide to withdraw what you have in the vault; do you get the btc equivalent of the cash you put into the vault? Or if you put 3k in thats all you can hope to get out from the vault?

Not regulation of bitcoin, regulation of exchanges. And nobody should adopt a blanket policy of deregulating or regulating. Whether or not to do either should be on a case by case basis. Just like "bitcoiners" opinions on the matter. Case by case.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:04:16
They are different things. Bitcoin regulates itself through its protocol.

Youre analogy is arguing against a position nobody holds. Nobody thinks that any drug dealer is a hero for providing a market for potentially "cleaner" drugs(although cleaner is better than cut, yes) Instead, I think most people would agree that rather than punishment being the sole means of dealing with drug offenders, if you gave them a chance to rehabilitate, they would. I have many acquaintances in engineering who were lucky enough to have the means to rehab themselves. Now they are productive members of society doing great things. If our only recourse was to lock everyone up, we'd have a lot people costing tax payers a lot of money, a lot more fatherless kids/struggling families, and the cycle would only continue. Our legal system needs to understand that people fuck up. Period. And when they do, do you want them to continue down the same shitty path, or give them a chance to be productive. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:29:49
If thats true I completely agree. Anyone who thinks they have the right to take someones life away needs to be removed from society.
