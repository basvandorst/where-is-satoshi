Obviously you do in taxes. But I’m talking about convenience (and overall cost to you I guess, because I find it pretty unlikely that the fees for an average btc transaction are less than the proportion of your taxes spent on currency regulation). I want to live in a universe where $20 is $20 when I’m buying something, not $20 plus fees and a 20 min wait.

dollars don't have transaction fees or confirmation times lol

those costs are eaten by the government, not the people involved in the transaction.
if I offer you $60 for furniture on craigslist, you're going to receive $60, and it's going to cost me $60, there's no fee that I have to pay, AND I don't have to wait to confirm that you will actually receive the money. I can just hand it to you.
yes, there are costs associated with managing a currency once it's been circulated. but those costs aren't going to be an inconvenience for the average person using that currency in their everyday life like they are for bitcoin. 
i would like to see bitcoin being used as a more mainstream currency but in the near future I do not think that it will have the kind of success you are talking about.

no, no, no (not sure which lerner), no, and because he was charged with money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics, and procuring murder. they were not charged with crimes, and he was. if you think that trump is going to go through every instance of a person being mistreated by the justice system and correct it, you are severely mistaken.

he won't pardon someone charged with selling drugs online. he may be stupid but he's not THAT stupid. everyone who voted for him would hate him.
