Just when I think I understand this stuff... I did not know this.

Let me introduce you to the glorious world of counterstrike skins. Valve put these trade-able, purely decorative skins into csgo a while back, and due to the games popularity, they attained a ridiculous value in actual money. I happen to have quite a collection of these skins that people try to scam off me regularly.
Its usually pretty easy to spot them, but this guy was clever enough to approach me in a way where I would at least talk to him. Wasn't smart enough to know that I could see everything on both ends of the transaction.

Precisely, it just isnt offically supported by valve. I don't belive its against the ToS, but IDK. Its done on a massive scale, in fact if you want to see something really crazy, head over the csgobetting subreddit.

Yes indeed. I have no trust of anyone who wants to do any other payment system for this, but thankfully the blockchain removes all the need for trust just perfectly.

Fair question. That's basically what happened. The way these jackoffs usually work is to say let's do paypal,  send you the payment, then do a charge back after they get the item.
What this particular sock monkey was trying to do was to bully me into giving up the gun without payment by threatening to report me as a scammer on steamrep (site for tracking trader reputation). A ban or scammer mark there pretty much makes it impossible to trade anymore. 
 
Fortunately,  it's very simple to prove he never had or sent the payment with the blockchain.

True enough. I would be pretty surprised if anyone who was on the up and up would accept my terms to buy my skins. I have sold a few smaller value items this way in the past, and all the buyer has to go off of is good faith that I will honor the arrangement. I do wish steam would set up some sort of cash sale system. They have one, but they make a 15% fee off of every transaction and you cant get the money out of their system. It's pretty dumb...

Ran into this genius today, tried to play the ol'scam4skins game.
I didn't accept a random ad per say, guy was actually gaming in a public server with me. Knew it was too good to be true.

Not just "a skin". The skin:
