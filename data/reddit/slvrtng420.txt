They also have a do it yourself set of plans that you don't even have to pay for, but for those of us who don't have the handyman gene, they have a nice full kit that they can ship to you. I am placing an order tonight and will let you know how it goes.

Hey if you are looking for a travel agency that accepts bitcoin checkout btcvacations.com. Jeff Gross is a travel agent based out of Texas who has a regular site as well. Jgsunandsail.com 
I have used them to book a couple cruises and business trips this year already.

Yeah, he is actually working on a more mainstream site for us bitcoiners, this was one that he threw together to see how it worked.  But you can browse any site for the cruises and then contact Jeff and ask him for a quote on that exact cruise. That part of it works great, as I said, I booked quite a bit of travel for the next year with him. Including a Miami trip in January to btcMiami, got me a great deal for my company on 3 air tickets and hotel rooms.
Give him a try, I have yet to be disappointed.

I just returned from a xmas vacation trip to visit family booked with btcVacations. Everything went flawlessly, was only a Super8 reservation so nothing spectacular but there were zero problems with reservation and location. I really do recommend giving him a try. Maybe start with something small like a one night hotel room reservation until you feel comfortable with other things.

I have used btcVacations.com now several times. If you do some research you can see that Jeff Gross is a Travel Agent based out of the Texas area. He actually has a regular site for non bitcoin users for his normal business. For us bitcoiners he was kind enough to create a site targeted at us directly. I have booked business trips to btcMiami with btcVacations for my bitcoin business, as well as using him for personal trips , a couple of cruises, and various other travel arrangements. I have found Jeff to be very forthright and helpful, providing me with confirmation information and receipts generated by the confirming companies. I have had zero issues with his service and in fact continue to use him as my sole travel agent for both my personal and business travel. I am happy to field questions or comments in regards to the business that I have transacted with Jeff.

My 2cents worth: Do some research before you start bashing up and coming bitcoin sites. They need all the help they can get from their fellow bitcoiners. As with every new business, someone has to be the first customer. I hope it was me! And as some supporting information 
and Jeff is affiliated with Agency: Travel Network 
who are a huge conglomerate of Travel Agents.
P.S. Anyone who wants to join me on the cruise I booked, Alaska in May12 2014 on Princess Cruises, lets make it a bitcoin event. I would love to talk to you about bitcoin, maybe I can write off my cruise as a business expense ;) bet my tax accountant would love that **snickers**
