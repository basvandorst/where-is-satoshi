I do commodity trading and stocks, but I'm pretty amateur. I'll figure out my plan and get an opinion from my advisor, but I'll probably end up sticking with mine.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:02:46
I was never familiar with them in the first place haha. I feel like a moron because you have no idea how frustrated I was that I skipped on buying the game I wanted for these. I want to kick myself for getting frustrated.
I'll weigh out what I want to do. To be honest, this is a bit shocking. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:08:01
My mom is taking all the externals in my room to a safe place tonight. I'll grab them from there when I get home. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:25:09
He did....on his dad's card. 
I don't talk to him anymore, but I hope he does well with it.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:43:14
Ok, hold on, how do you get cash for them? Is it worth it to do it?
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:51:30
I love humble bundle, I buy them every time there is a new one. If not for myself, then just to give the games to my pals. I hope what I have is worth something nice.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:25:21
But...but I have to drive through JERSEY. Haha. All kidding aside, you have a point. I called my parents to make sure they didn't throw the HDD away and my mom is already planning how she is going to spend the money, so driving back sooner than later might be advantageous. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:57:52
If I exchanged them, I would reinvest. I've taken some money from my trust and invested it already, putting more in wouldn't hurt.
OR would it be worth it to let it sit and mature(if that's what it's called?)
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:06:51
Yea, it's a lot to think about. I'll have to weigh my options
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:24:03
Awesome. I'll probably move it to cash instead of spending it online, but I like to keep my options open.
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:32:13
That guy must be pissed.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:52:22
Very cool. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:34:25
New appliances everywhere. I'll need to move fast.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:41:38
Is there anywhere I can see how much they cost back then? Is it "hypothetically" 43k or can I actually exchange it?
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:08:12
That's just a normal night for her, but I'll let her know.
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:14:17
I got that figure throughout the thread, but I'm still pretty shocked. I might have peed a little haha
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:42:22
I completely agree. I lost my best friend because of it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:21:58
93 bitcoins in total. 
It took a while, so I ended up going to my dads office to use a new computer that wasn't even opened yet to look through the drive. I was able to get someone to help me to make a paper wallet and make it secure.
I decided to exchange some of the bitcoin over time, like 2-4 a week. I was able to buy my mom a christmas gift and get myself a Sig 229 from the factory in NH today. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:59:14
Are they steady enough to think that if I let them sit for a few more months they would be worth more?
I have a beginners stock portfolio and I've learned that letting them sit for a bit is worth it sometimes. Is that the case here?
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:54:31
You sly dog.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:54:42
Not to my knowledge haha
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:01:02
Oh, that's very cool! So it's actually a tangible currency. That's pretty cool. 
Is there any place that lists the sites that accept bit coins?
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:39:20
I like the 226.
I'm hoping prices will rise and I can sell them for more. Unless you have another suggestion
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:47:04
I don't think I'm a millionaire. That couldn't be possible, don't get me excited. My buddy was sleeping over the weekend when he got me to get them. I thought they were just a novelty and wouldn't amount to much, I didn't even remember until the thread from I only remember the amount I spent, $15, because I couldn't buy Assassins Creed 2 because I would have gone over my credit limit. I had to wait for an extra month for that game. 
Were there other exchanges around then? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:39:43
That's a site I was looking for. Awesome!!
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:35:13
Nothing to report until I can go to Pennsylvania. All of my external hdd have been put somewhere safe in the meantime though
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:28:50
This is like some spy stuff. Is that type of security necessary? 
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:22:16
I'm about as unintimidating as a potato, haha. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:29:24
AUNTs house
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:37:45
Oh. My. God.
I feel bad for that guy.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:48:26
It's sitting on my desk in my room. Untouched. Unless my parents tossed it, but I highly highly doubt that
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:50:49
This is like a spygame. Sheesh, I'm getting paranoid.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:48:06
I would cry. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:03:53
No news other than all the externals from my room are in a secure location. I need to travel back to PA before I can check them for the file
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:35:14
That's pretty cool. There's lots of neat stuff on that site.
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:55:40
Will do. Thanks buddy!
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:47:27
I'm pretty conflicted right now. I'm gonna take a few days to figure out what I want to do. Maybe a 50/50 split, maybe 60/40 or maybe just cash them all in.
Thanks for the advice!!!
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:16:31
Mom uses google to get to google. Teamviewer might be outside of her scope. I told her to take it to a safe place and I'll grab it when I get home
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:08:52
I'm going to talk to a financial advisor, even if it's not much. I think that's the best course of action.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:06:07
My mom is taking all the externals in my room to another place that's safe. I thought of the same thing. Thanks for the concern!
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:15:18
I'm learning that, I'm very excited.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:27:37
Thanks for the sound advice. My head is spinning from all of this stuff happening today. I'm pretty financially stable, I have a trust that I can use when I'm older but I'm by no means rich. I'm thinking I'll split the money, reinvest some, donate some and keep the rest as bitcoin.
I'll find a trustworthy person who can help me too. It might take time to find them though haha.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:39:03
I don't remember how many I purchased, just that it was $15 worth.
I put it on my external. My buddy who was more tech saavy put it on there after I bought it. I don't talk with him anymore, but I still have the HDD, I'm going to check it when I go home for thanksgiving.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:48:53
Ok before I even hook up the external to a computer, I will need to research all of this. Thank you man.
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:26:46
Shut up. Haha. If I go home and I only have 215 instead of 1850, I'm going to be upset. I'll blame you.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:19:41
Haha! I won't tell anyone other than this sub and my folks until I secure it. I don't want to jinx myself.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:14:37
My dad uses google to get to google so I might have to ask someone who has more tech skills. It's a good idea though, I don't like driving 7 hours back and forth, but for this I might.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:07:57
Yea that's a good point. I'll find the HDD when I'm home THEN I will start to plan what I want to do. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:44:32
I don't know the number, I just remember the $15 because I had to skip on buying the game I wanted. I'm going home for Thanksgiving, I will check my HDD then or sooner.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:37:18
So this stuff might be beyond my technical know-how. However, I will see if my dads company techie knows anything. I can trust him not to scam me.
I'm really getting paranoid now with how easy people are telling it is to take this from people. Luckily it's on an unconnected external.
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:15:27
All of them haha
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:40:08
NATTYICE FOR ALL!
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:36:09
He got involved with a girl and dropped all his friends. Hes a good guy, just can't balance friends and an SO. I'll try to reach out but chances are the gf hasnt unblocked any of his friends from his phone.
