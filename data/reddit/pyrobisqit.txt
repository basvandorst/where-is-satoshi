Because it is not wallet.dat.exe...
The scammer has a pretty interesting technique, he resorts to leaving original filenames (not double extension), and then attach a lnk file which will run them.
I know this because I got this mail too, and when I opened it on my Linux machine, the txt file didn't look like a normal txt file, but rather a binary file. From that point on, I exercised extreme caution, as it was more than evident that this was malware. Too bad I'm using Linux, right? :)

Thank god. This place is filled with pseudo moralists seeking to stop people just because someone wants to harm himself for doing stupid things.
Also some people need to read the definition of trolling. Like seriously. Nowadays trolling seems to be simply insulting someone or trying to make fun in public of someone else. That is not trolling for fuck's sake already!

I don't have any bank accounts linked, but I was willing to in around march. Now I have cancelled my account. I guess Mt.gox experienced a massive account cancellation because of this.
I mean, maybe it's nothing, but seeing how Mt.gox has screwed customers over and over again, I'm really not going to do any business with them (and I'm glad I never did).

Sorry what?
If I invested all my life savings in the Nasdaq all my money and the USA economy collapsed, would it be USA's fault or my fault for investing money I couldn't afford to lose?
No no no. Zero support. They should have known better and listened to the repeated warnings that Mt.gox was not trustworthy.
They wanted to make a lot of money and ended up with less money, that's their own fault. It's like using all your life savings to buy lotto tickets. You could win a lot of money. But you could also lose a lot.
Zero support.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:37:00
Yep, all that money would be lost because there would be a bailout. Exactly what will not happen with Bitcoin: bailouts. Unfortunately, stupid people will lose money. Fortunately, the cancer has been cut off and will no longer intoxicate the Bitcoin community and won't have any impact in prices rising and falling artificially.

By the way, it was pretty much safe to open the link. It would just download a zip file, with 3 binary files, a txt (actually a win32 app), a wallet.dat (presumably another win32 app) and a .txt.lnk file which will attempt to run the password.txt in a commandline.

The only way to destroy BTC is, like someone pointed before me, transfer to a wallet to which you lose the key.
Other ways including dumping your HDD in the trash bin, rendering your private keys effectively inaccessible, or maybe setting your computer on fire.
But I'm sure this is not the case. Those coins have been stolen or the mtgox people simply decided to go full retard and run away with the coins. So either a group of hackers has them, or the mt.gox staff.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:03:49

Innocent for mantaining a faulty trading system?
Let's get this straight. even if they didn't take all that money, they were running a platform which had serious software issues and didn't fully comply with the Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:27:34
It's not trolling. I really am sorry for the people who lost money on Mt. Gox, but like I said earlier, it was their and only their fault. Many many people have advised against Mt. Gox, including me. I even almost open an account for my mother, but finally reconsidered there are better exchanges (3 months ago, and I'm not an economist, I'm simply not fucking retarded).
But keep this in mind: those who lost everything didn't so because of a banking failure, or because someone robbed them. They all had one thing in common, they all wanted to get rich quick (hell, so do I), and they assumed risks, and overlooked them. They forgot the most important rule: don't gamble with what you can't afford to lose. Should we show support to gamblers who lose everything against fucking machines at bars? Doubt it. It's only their fault, blinded by promises of success and over trusting their own self.
Mistakes happen. People will learn. Some will suicide (hope not, never a good choice, even if I don't feel sympathy for them), some others, the strongest ones, will move on and learn from this huge mistake.
In the end we all benefit: those who experience it are there to spread the word and raise awareness. In Spain we have a saying that goes along the lines of "words with blood get noticed" meaning approximately that people need to suffer in order to learn. Few times there is learning without physical, mental or psychological suffering.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:38:14
I've seen people that allegedly lost up to 550 BTC.
Disregarding whether this is fake or not... It sure is quite stupid, per my point of view to store more than 10 BTC there. That's already a huge volume of dollars! 10 BTC would have been worth more than 10k dollars! more than a lot of people can earn in a single month.
The rest, cold storage.
But what would you expect? Mt.gox customers were morons. They've been warned over and over... So they had plenty of time to prepare themselves but chose not to.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:56:01
But are you, really :D
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:18:04
How much money did you lose?
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:37:10
No dude. People are just fucking stupid. It doesn't matter how much you tell them something is risky. Until they don't see with their own eyes, they won't believe it.
But well, the lightbulb was invented after a fuckload of fails, so... I guess it's not that bad at all?
But people are losing faith in the wrong thing. It's not Bitcoin that shouldn't be trusted, it's shady exchanges as gox. Never understood why people traded at around 1000 € there when in other exchanges it was worth like 700... It just doesn't make sense to me.

Gox isn't a car, it's a parking that requires you to give them the keys so they can park your car for you. Is it really their fault for letting strangers steal your key and run away with it? Or rather your fault for giving strangers indirect complete control over your car?
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:26:55
I only have a question... Since bitcoins are a digital good... They can be transferred AFTER you land in your hotel, right?
I mean, I can have my encrypted wallet uploaded to my private server, and then, when I'm in the hotel room, I can download that wallet file to my laptop to then transfer those coins to my Android phone. (I won't store private keys, because that essentially gives access to this wallet and could be considered "carrying bitcoins").
When I go back to my home country, before leaving the hotel, I transfer my remaining BTC from my Android phone to my laptop, and then uninstall the Windows wallet and clear any trace of the downloaded wallet file.
And while I'm doing all this, I certainly did not break any law, did I?
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:53:07
No, I don't want to take this post down! I'm not even offering myself to contract them, I'm just asking a question, and like I said, I didn't even have funds there!

I don't give a shit, really. Hell, I don't even know their names, I just realized that not too long ago I saw an onion hidden site to contract killers.
Either way, to tell the truth, I wouldn't trust hired killers. Specially when they ask to be paid in BTC. Who's gonna assure me their success? International laws??? Hahahaha
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:30:48
And on the same lines... Since you can be a criminal for travelling with non-declared goods of up to 10K €, would you be a criminal if you had a file in your computer that referred to a contract (that's not yet finished) for a total sum of, say 100K €?
I really don't get how this lawyers try to ban digital goods... From bitcoins, to porn (with exceptions, let's not talk about child porn), or even employers trying to regulate digital services such as Facebook and Twitter.
Maybe I was born too "late" to be able to understand there are certain things that, in the past, were absolutely regulated (say, importing books to a country like the Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union).

@_date: 2014-02-25 14:57:58
And the fact that you accept that the rich get richer and the poor, poorer, is the exact reason why this world is so fucking broken beyond repair.
It shouldn't be a matter of "sometimes you win, sometimes you lose", it shouldn't be a fact of being a fucking asshole and taking money that's not yours (hello, banking system). It should be a matter of effort and willpower, like they tell us in the school, lying horribly to us.
@_date: 2014-01-11 18:29:10
Indeed it does matter. This technique would have forced me to type "bash notatextfile.txt" in order to run the malware.
Also, to a Linux user (we don't have extensions, so if you, for example, rename a .png file to .txt, and then double click it, it will launch the image viewer because the file format is deduced from its metadata, not from the extension), a txt file filled with illegible rubbish would have been more than highly suspicious (as it happened with me).
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:58:38
Yep. Gox is basically greed. There are African kids dying and they didn't even gamble with their money, they work like slaves and barely have any money to buy bread. Fuck Mt.Gox customers. It's their fault for playing a game they knew (of should have) they could lose. Moreover, they have been warned over and over after multiple security breaches.
It's their fault for investing money they couldn't afford to lose. They shouldn't have played big boy games in the first place.

Get MalwareBytes 
Open up the task manager and look for suspicious processes.
Get noscript for Firefox to avoid these stuff in the future, and disable JS in Chrome by default, along with click to play to enable plug-ins.
If you have Avast!, replace it with something better. Bitdefender and Kaspersky are good anti viruses.
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:51:08
OK, whatever. Downvote my comments to hell. You talk like these people were fooled and didn't have any responsibility. I honestly wish life was really like that. So that every time I fail, nothing would happen and people would pay for my errors. Unfortunately, unless my dad was Bill Gates, that's not what would happen to me, and I'm sure you're not Bill Gates' son either, so you're the fucking stupid one for taking away responsibility.
Like I said, it's not trolling, it's just common sense. NO ONE will help you when you fail making a startup for example. Of course your close family and friends will make sure you don't end sleeping in the streets, but that's as far as things will go. And you should already know that, or log off the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:56:06
NO. Gox had several security failures, and repeatedly chose to ignore their users and assure "everything is OK". Which is not.
They're not even explaining anything. They chose not to inform their users and leave them in the limbo. If Gox comes back, we'll all suffer the consequences.

depends to what extent. If you trust 6 confirmations for buying anything, both the buyer and receiver are pretty safe. If however, you hand over your bitcoins to somebody else... Well, you know what happens. (Hint: fractional reserve).
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:42:57
Well if you visited what I linked, you have nothing to worry since you saw the source code but didn't run it. For JS to work it must be embedded into an HTML file or similar, just like you wouldn't expect an exe to run by itself just by downloading it.
But either way, you should install NoScript for Firefox or disable JS by default in Chrome. That should drastically improve your browser security with little impact in usability.

@_date: 2014-02-28 15:57:29
No. But the risks are approximately the same. Maybe a bit less because stocks can be (and have been, throughout the years) manipulated. Bitcoins cannot: there are or there are not. There's no such thing as credit for BTC.
