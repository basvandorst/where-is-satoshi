Well you might want to study economics and human nature more.
Cryptos are not precious metals. They are digital currency. And they are still in their infancy, with a poor track record for reliable/safe investment thus far. 
Precious metals tend to go up in value during a recession due mainly to the fact that people get paranoid, and precious metals have tremendous real world applications such as consumer electronics, aerospace, semiconductor, medical, jewelry/fashion (yes, jewelry- there will still be plenty of rich people buying gold and platinum jewelry during a recession), etc. They have proven to be a safe investment over time because they are real, rare, and useful.
When people lose faith in the financial systems of the world, they want to 'store' their wealth in precious metals for obvious reasons. 
Crypto's, on the other hand, are a new type of currency that exists digitally and has no tangible or intrinsic value in the world. For most  intents and purposes, it's just electronic money. When people holding crypto are faced with economic hardship, this will be the first thing most of them sell. No matter how decentralized these currencies may be, many people will lose faith in the crypto market and sell it for tangible, useful fiat currency during a recession. They will then use the fiat to survive, and possibly invest in tangible goods like gold, silver, oil, etc if they can afford to.
So I'm sorry to be the bearer of reality and bad news, but in an economic recession, crypto values will absolutely plummet. No doubt about it.
