You also see where yours didn't end up (the other outputs in that transaction).
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:50:29
In my experience the uphill nature of the learning curve for thinking in BTC amounts evens out within about 1-2 weeks / 5-10 transactions without the crutch of in-app conversions. Once you're able to think in BTC you actually have a truer sense of what you're holding onto in the first place, too.

Don't hold your breath for proof of these wild and unrelated claims, cause you won't get any. That comment right there is FUD at its finest.
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:38:07
You can pair your wallet to dojo before you create it. And never communicate with their servers. This is outdated FUD and you're full of shit tbh.   
 "trojan with zero privacy, because they report your full history to home base, which they then resell to law enforcement", is pretty clearly unsubstantiated FUD and lies coming from you, meant to deflect and distract from serious unaddressed flaws in Wasabi.

I'm glad they made this move. I'm kinda tired of people updating the world on the fluctuating USD cost of their on-chain lattes, and of newb friends complaining that "the $5 you sent me is now only 4.94 WTF". No dude, the 0.00076 btc I sent you remains 0.00076 btc...there's a billion other wallets that have fiat all over them.........what's the issue?

Hey man, make sure you've got the latest update. They do have an offline mode and it's pretty kickass. You don't need access to internet to access Samourai anymore --- hell you don't even need a SIM card. In offline mode you'll be allowed to copy the raw transaction hex to your clipboard or scan the QR. 


You can totally do this, just copy the raw transaction hex and send it to your friend/family via SMS/Pigeon Carrier/Your Preference and then they go to the transactions page inside of settings and voila! **Broadcast Raw Transaction Hex.**

Mycelium's Tor feature uses Orbot as an integration not dissimilar to what Samourai featured prior to this update. What's fundamentally different about this update is that you don't need the Orbot app to use Tor in Samourai anymore --  as they've replaced the Orbot integration with a built-in Tor service. It's pretty dope 
@_date: 2019-03-20 20:54:07
Something like that. When creating a wallet you can now tap a checkbox to enable Tor from the very beginning. When installing the update on an existing wallet, your settings carry over IIRC so if you have Tor enabled on your existing wallet, your wallet will open with Samourai's built-in Tor service running. If you **do** **not** have Tor enabled, your wallet will not initialize Tor on startup but you can easily enable it by tapping the Tor icon in the top right of the main screen. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 20:49:48
\*if you use Tor. You're still able to disable Tor on your wallet if you want to use clearnet, you just don't have to use Orbot to route via Tor anymore since Tor is built-in as of this update.

AFAIK They primarily make money through donations and through fees assessed on premium transactions (Ricochet,  soon Whirlpool). They've talked about this on Twitter and on Stephan Liveras podcast

Unproven and unsubstantiated claim of being in Chainalysis followed by shameless plugging of Wasabi Wallet. Nice Lil PR scheme you got there.

@_date: 2019-06-02 18:33:40
Gonna be pretty nice to be able to route Whirlpool mixes and two-party Cahoots style CoinJoins through your own full node via a mobile wallet using a tor hidden service.
Where else are these types of features and tools being made available in a competing mobile wallet?? Won't hold my breath for answers.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:58:08
I don't think Ricochet is designed for tackling targeted analysis/increasing privacay dramatically so much as it is a precaution against "tainting" algorithms selecting your coins for a TSA-style secondary screening. Ricochet is most effective in my experience when sending coins you are unsure of the 'provenance' of to custodial services or exchanges, particularly if you're worried at all about those coins being 'frozen'.

Samourai wallet's Ricochet feature would probably help them fly under the radar for basic 'taint' analysis too. Will be interesting to check back in on those addresses in a year or so once their utxos start getting used as inputs on new txs, if for nothing else just to see how they're moving and where they go. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:02:05
The irony is that Samourai is alpha software that hasn't even reached 1.0 yet. It probably shouldn't even be reaching the point of comparison to other wallet providers/companies in theory given that fact alone. Despite this, IT DOES.  When you install it in Google Play you see 'Unreleased App' and a bunch of warnings. Why would an unreleased app with all these warnings in the Play Store, and FUD on reddit, still be being compared as a superior alternative to established mobile wallet providers such as mycelium, coinomi, etc?   
The truth for me is Samourai sticks out from the crowd of shitcoins and custodial solutions and consistently is ahead of the curve on what to me are critical features that other wallets have either intentionally neglected, or in other cases just not even thought about yet. Whether it was the implementation of SegWit (samourai was one of the first), or the unique features like stonewall and Paynyms which OP seems to try to make sound shady but are actually just a few examples of what makes samourai stand out from any other mobile wallet in the first place. 
How many wallets.failed in the last month or two? Meanwhile Samourai's name continues to pop up more and more due to the uniquely interesting work that they're doing. whether its txtenna or offline mode or whirlpool or cahoots or stowaway or support for using OpenDimes, sweeping private keys, using bech32 addresses, ricochet, tor support, Dojo full nodes. I'm glad at least one wallet in the space that's been here a while has been doing something other than focusing on shitcoin implementation, custodial solutions and **not** supporting Segwit. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:49:30
If you're importing a wallet created in Samourai, you're going to need your 12 secret words (mnemonic) and your passphrase (BIP39 password). In some apps, this passphrase is also called by other names (I think electrum calls it an extended passphrase or something). You will need both your 12 secret words AND your passphrase to restore, since your passphrase (a password of your choosing) is essentially a "13th" secret word in your mnemonic.

He's re-using the same legacy address:   
1MjT133uzRfN6CwnkyhXZ4d2vci9vEiBAN  
If CB determines that one of the many donations (totalling at 0.79721253 BTC at this time) made to Rubin at this static address came from a 'tainted' source -- then we wouldn't need to wait for 3rd party pressure to have access to his funds disturbed. Overzealous custodial policies and notions of 'tainting' are just as much if not more of a threat.

For those interested, Jordan B. Peterson is also using a static donation address 1JDQ2Q1pP5jS8epKbCmifd5ZMoBqaGcMTH, and as of the writing of this message that address shows a balance of 1.67719228 BTC or around double what Rubin has received. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 18:42:06
If I'm not mistaken (I need to doublecheck), Rubin's static address is a receive address for his Ledger.

Wasabi is not a mobile wallet. Wasabi is a desktop wallet. Samourai is a mobile-only wallet. There isn't really a comparison to be made in that regard.

I'm sorry but Luke is a megalomaniac with a vendetta who gets off on clout because it's all he has left. Anyone watching this unfold can see how he trawls Twitter for anyone posting about Samourai so he can "warn" them not to use it under the auspices of being your friendly neighborhood OG. 
That is when he isn't busy arguing the many facets of why masturbating is genocide, or shaming noobs for not using full nodes, or using the 'wrong' service for their BTC while he LITERALLY USES PATREON FOR DONATIONS. His suggestion is that they use Knots as a wallet. 
Completely unhinged and completely removed from reality.

There's a desktop app for Whirlpool pending a broader public release I believe. No desktop Samourai at this time.

It's designed to help improve/hack fungibility by adding additional transaction history in the form of 'hops' before your transaction goes to it's final destination. Most users that I know of use it when sending coins to an Exchange whenever nervous about potential "blacklisting". I'm sure there's probably other uses I'm missing.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:42:46
Do you have your 12 secret words stored/written down somewhere, and do you know your passphrase? If so you should be able to restore in any compatible wallet (Electrum, Coinomi, etc) using those details.

If you're gonna use Trusted Node as it currently stands, at least use a VPN. They have support guides on how to do that in their knowledge base.

When Dojo drops ("allegedly": before some of you pop a blood vessel on me), your connection to your full node will be more robust and meaningful, and will be routed over a Tor connection using .onion addresses.  At least that's what I hear.
