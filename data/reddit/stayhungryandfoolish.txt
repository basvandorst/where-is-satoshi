I’m not sure about fees or which US exchange is best (probably Coinbase or Gemini). So I can’t answer your question whatsoever. 
Buying the 300 in smaller increments might facilitate things though. 30 BTC per day over ten days might raise less flags?

There is a Secure Enclave coprocessor in most Apple devices these days. It could be capable of generating a private key and internally signing transactions, though I’m not entirely sure. Excerpt from their security documents:
“It uses encrypted memory and includes a hardware random number generator. The Secure Enclave provides all cryptographic operations for Data Protection key management and maintains the integrity of Data Protection even if the kernel has been compromised.”

So the first comment is best. Probably ask a tax person.
That said, as far as I understand what matters to a tax authority, is the cost basis of your BTC in that country’s currency.
Thus if you bought some bitcoin for X USD, your cost basis in CAD (for example) would be whatever that USD was worth in CAD at the time.
So when you sell for CAD your capital gains would be calculated based on that.
Someone correct me if I’m wrong.

It's not such a great leap. 'Whole life' isn't quite accurate, but the average person works 9-5 for fiat money. So okay. 1/3 of their life is spent working for a lie (or at least a scam) called fiat money. Considering another 1/3 is spent sleeping, they're working 1/2 their waking life for tokens that are disappearing out from under them, at a rate determined by the producers of said tokens.
'Lie' isn't quite accurate either. It's more like 'an unfair deal'.

@_date: 2018-05-24 20:31:11
There actually is no way the true price could be $1000.
21 Million * 1000 is only 21 Billion
21 Billion is just a skyscraper or two in New York, it’s not the market cap of a scarce store of value asset, particularly the latest and most ideal one mankind has ever seen.
Internet-like network effects are bound to push usage/demand for Bitcoin well beyond the multi-trillion dollar market cap. It’s not quite guaranteed, it’s just highly likely to be worth $100k plus in the intermediate future.
Also depends how many new dollars are printed.
Think of Bitcoin this way: the demand side, fiat currency, can be printed infinitely. 
The supply side, BTC, is incredibly limited, scarce and historically easy to lose.
Do the math. This is the greatest economic shift and opportunity in recent human history. The arbitrage is that most folks aren’t computer scientists or economists, let alone both. They’ll adopt it for more pedestrian reasons, after an inflection point of some kind.

I like to imagine that a decentralized government is possible. Basically where people can spend crypto to vote for things, instead of paying taxes. Perhaps people could be dynamically entitled to an amount of public services relative to the amount they've 'voted'.
This is probably a flawed idea, but generally I think somehow a much more granular, precise (and decentralized) form of taxation and decision making should be possible with modern tech.

OP, I've lived in San Francisco for the past two years, and I can attest to what your saying. Bitcoin is quite far from mainstream here. Although it is a giant tech hub, keep in mind that it's mostly due to giant tech companies like Google, Facebook, Uber, Twitter etc. who all have successful products which don't involve or require Bitcoin whatsoever at the moment. Consequently most of the young tech professionals are focused on everything but Bitcoin.
There are of course more than a few startups in the crypto space, I'm just saying is they're still the relative minority.
For this reason I'm not surprised Bitcoin isn't a popular payment option yet. People are more stoked on Apple Paying with their new watch.
Of course we'd all like to see Bitcoin adoption here sooner than later. Andreas Antonopoulos says it all the time, the other 5 billion need Bitcoin way more than Silicon Valley does, so they'll likely be taking it mainstream first.
Most techies I know in San Francisco still don't think they need Bitcoin. It's still early days gentlemen.

People's US dollar debt will eventually become worthless, not only in terms of Bitcoin but in terms of tangible goods as well. Even without holding Bitcoin, a 70k student loan will eventually be the equivalent value of a single loaf of bread and thus won't even be worth the collection costs.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:39:39
Actually, I would say the speculation is caused by the imminent deflation. A proper speculator has read the whitepaper, understood the utility, the deflationary economic rules, and the immutability of all the above. This provides the knowledge advantage that leads one to speculate on future value.
You seem to think people are blindly speculating based solely on previous price movements or something.

You're right about Bitcoin speculation also being an example of the greater fool model. You are very wrong that it functions like any other ponzi. The supply and distribution are not controlled by some scammer (or the fed).
This makes all the difference. This is why it's worth holding. Supply is guaranteed to decrease, so as long as demand/utility remains equal or increases, more fools will join. And there are a lot of "greater fools" left. Billions in fact.
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:04:50
Disagree. For now, developed countries like the US and Canada have no need for Bitcoin as a transactional currency. People are already relatively free to spend as they please digitally, as they aren’t being prosecuted religiously or otherwise. 
In those places, the need for it as a store of value is also lesser however it is the primary use case, because even developed nations tend to “quantitative ease” their way to inflation, and presumably, eventual hyperinflation.
I do however, see what you mean about capital gains tax encouraging investment use, but it’s a red herring.
The root issue is the governments ability to convince the populace to pay taxes in the first place, via the threat of force paid for by inflationary spending.

Yes, those protocols coordinate between decentralized hosts of the data.
I see what you mean. Something like that is feasible, but the term blockchain is a misnomer in that context.

Not blockchains, but yeah definitely relevant tech for a decentralized github.

Umm if you “don’t see why it can’t be hosted on the blockchain” then you need to learn what a blockchain is.

Ya gotta disagree here. Holding is a use, and holding helps keeps the value up, which will encourage more use. Spending bitcoin is like a vote saying "I'd rather have X than this Y amount of bitcoin".
That's a vote against bitcoin and for whoever sold you X.
Hold the bitcoin, or spend it to get more.
Spending it on stuff is the same as selling.
If you are selling you want no part of this stuff.

This is somewhat true. It’s almost like a binary option.
However unlike other things, one can attain a deep understanding of the tech, the ecosystem and the macroeconomic context within which it’s all happening.
The unavoidable conclusion is that it is less of a binary option (high risk, high reward) and more of a drastically undervalued opportunity.
Basically you can reduce the apparent risk with some thorough research and math.
This “professional asset manager” clearly hasn’t done so yet, which is why he believes his small allocation is still borderline irrational. Meanwhile it’s hardly sufficient.
He will lose the vast majority of his purchasing power to people like us in the mid to long term.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:49:19
Theoretically yes. Although when using an app like CoPay or Breadwallet that generates your keys, it’s difficult to prove that the key hasn’t also been sent elsewhere.
Also, your key is inside an internet connected device. On iPhone this is somewhat less of a concern since it has a Secure Enclave, where the CoPay devs would put it if they’re at all competent.
Still, consider a dedicated hardware wallet. These come in tamper proof packaging and allow you to provide the entropy for the seed. They also allow you to validate each transaction offline, on the device before sending.
Contrast that with the potential for a bug in CoPay that might make it look like you’re sending a certain transaction, while actually signing and broadcasting a completely different one.. maybe to a rogue CoPay dev.

Fiat currencies are not the same as tokens moving via a permission less proof of work protocol.
Fiat currencies are created, maintained and enforced by local governing bodies, which more or less explains why there are still many.
There was AM and FM radio... now there’s one internet.
It seems to me that with low friction technologies, people end up congregating around a single one.
There’s one Youtube, There’s one twitter. There’s one major search engine. 
Mostly playing devils advocate at this point - I can see your point and have considered it myself. However even if there are a multitude of relevant cryptos in the long term - power law will apply and the top crypto will have magnitudes more adoption and value than the next runner up.

Welcome! Great conversation. I think it’s still massively undervalued. Regulatory arbitrage preventing large capital investments, combined with the initial hesitation of mainstream people leads me to believe that we are still in the early adopter phase of the adoption S-curve.
I read an interesting comment about how stock prices rarely go higher than a few thousand per share. There’s been a spike of “unsustainable bubble” rhetoric since Bitcoin rose above about ~$2000.
There are only 21 million Bitcoin “shares”. Stocks normally have hundreds of millions of issued shares. Do the math, think about it and don’t interpret your excitement and foresight as irrational. Hodl on fam.

@_date: 2017-11-05 09:58:06
okay yeah so this is a much more nuanced debate for sure.
Basically: will Bitcoin really be the dominant blockchain?
First of all, I believe the fear mongering around forks and other drama is very overblown, likely pushed by those who went all in on ETH or other cryptos.
A blockchain like Bitcoin is a protocol. Protocols are not like applications on top of a protocol. When it comes to protocols, there tends to be a single major winner.
There is always plenty of competition between applications built on top of a useful protocol, the obvious example being websites on top of the internet.
I think the bitcoin blockchain is the internet of money, and therefore when the dust settles - there will only be one, just like the internet protocol stack we all use today. 
Even if you think Bitcoin is more of an application, consider power-law. The top 5 websites get 98% of traffic.
The top website, Google, gets an enormously disproportionate share of web traffic.
Bitcoin is the Google of blockchains and will account for a vast amount of the value, magnitudes more than the  crypto.

Merchants don’t have to accept Bitcoin for it to be very, very valuable and successful.

Bitcoin is a store of value, a bearer asset and a hard money. It is a hedge against hyperinflation in slimy economies.

This guy is somewhat blinded by the past, his education and his adversity to risk.
Bitcoin and blockchains are the future. The same way Netflix and YouTube were the future of video.
He’s advocating you keep 90% in the equivalent of Blockbuster.
Diversify into other cryptos, if you must. Only trust a bank with about 10%, invested in the S&amp;P500 or a major index like that.
Bitcoin is clearly still near the bottom of it’s adoption S-curve. Read about those. Successful tech follows an S-curve. It will go parabolic during mainstream and institutional adoption. It is the single greatest opportunity of our lifetimes. Last generation was the internet. (Look at all the internet billionaires.)
This time around, the majority of the value is to be captured in the protocol layer, rather than the applications layer on top. Free, decentralized applications or “smart-contracts” will communicate value and trust using very valuable blockchain tokens. Bitcoin is by far and will continue to be the dominant protocol.

This is already happening somewhat. Venezuelans use it to buy food on Amazon via Purse for example.
Generally I agree. What you are trying to say is that circular economies need to develop.
Rough example:
Purchase with BTC, merchant buys more stock with BTC from producer. Producer buys raw materials with BTC. Raw materials are mined by workers getting paid in BTC. They spend that BTC to buy products.

Are you aware what the transaction fee on a blockchain pays for? It pays for compute power to compete in a hash lottery where the winner is subject to game theory that guarantees they add valid transactions to the chain.
I don’t know what a tangle coordinator is and I really don’t care to read their marketing paper. I strongly consider you reevaluate IOTA and it’s long term potential.
I have no doubt Bosch and other companies might use it.
I have no doubt that it’s centralized “coordinators” can process transactions for free.
I doubt that it is at all comparable to Bitcoin in terms of being a relatively guaranteed store of value.

You aren’t seeing the bigger picture or the fundamentals.
Fads and trends follow bubble patterns, it’s good to spot those and call them out.
However new technologies like Bitcoin follow S adoption curves. They go up, fast, and never come down. It’s against all intuition, our brains naturally see such a thing as irrational.
S adoption curve. Google it. Read about it.

You are correct. It won’t be seen as a bubble. It never will.
Trends and fads create bubbles. Successful new technologies like Bitcoin create S adoption curves.
Saying nobody knows isn’t really true. There have been decades of research into these kinds of phenomena.
I recommend reading “The Diffusion of Innovations”.

What gives “legal tender” it’s value though?
Value cannot be declared. It cannot be enforced.
I don’t have to accept your dollars. In fact I don’t.
Many people still do, that’s why they still have some value.
But similarly, as less and less people agree to accept a dollar in exchange for things, the value will diminish.
In fact, historically, fiat or government legal tenders always lose all their value, their purchasing power in the long run.
Not a single fiat currency has lasted more than 100 years or so.

Yes, but have you looked into what the supply and demand are? There’s not much supply. At all. There’s a huge and rapidly increasing amount of demand.
S adoption curves are the typical way to model a successful new technology. Bitcoin is therefore following an S curve. It’ll go vertical through magnitude increases.

I did not conflate Bitcoin with other assets.
I simply cited those as an example of something else that isn’t DIRECTLY exchangeable for products and services.
“Buying bitcoin to covert back to fiat is the antithesis of what Bitcoin is about”
I couldn’t agree more. I never said people should or will do that.
Second layer solutions can and will allow Bitcoin to be spent as you are hoping. At WalMart, for coffee, etc.
For example someone who uses Coinbase can send Bitcoin to another Coinbase user for free - because it never needs to hit the blockchain. Both users have chosen to trust Coinbase instead of the blockchain, at least with their spending money.
The lightning network is a decentralized attempt to achieve a similar effect.
I said Bitcoin, as in real Bitcoin blockchain transactions don’t ever have to be directly accepted by merchants. Instead they will accept it via a merchant provider who batches up transactions, or ideally something more like a  lightning node.

Here’s a little secret. Money was never physical or real. It has always been about communicating your respect or appreciation for a product or service. The same way you communicate in English about other things.
We’ve got agreed upon rituals for communicating value to each other. Wether it’s cash, swiping a credit card, handing over some gold or doing a little dance for a free sample. It’s all the same. From your everyday purchases all the way up to massive corporations and countries doing deals.
They say: “here is our ritual: we’ll tell this bank that you now own 32 Billion of our imaginary things called dollars!”
Maybe this results in some boats full of goods from China arriving a few weeks later. The goods are real, the money was just communication though. A way of asking for the goods, in the right language. You might call the language “Dollars and Banks”.
Bitcoin is just a new, better language of value.
But that doesn’t mean it’s any more physical or real than the languages of value that came before it.
In fact, it’s genius is to fully sacrifice the facade of physicality in exchange for perfect security and ease of communication, among other things.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:32:04
The difference here, is that this time all the value is being captured in the protocol layer, not in the applications.
People got burnt buying into Pets.com
Imagine if they could have bought shares of SMTP or HTML instead. Bitcoin is the equivalent of buying into the protocol, essentially indexing the entire ecosystem.
We’ve never seen a protocol like this with a native value token, essentially IPO’ing itself overtime.
Union Square Ventures did a decent write up about this: 
To reiterate: This time the applications will be free and decentralized. People don’t have to try to pick winners. They can simply buy into the protocol itself.
This is quite literally like buying a share in the next greatest protocol humanity has ever seen.

No. The person selling a service enables you to buy with the currency of their choosing.
Similarly, as a buyer of a service you have a choice of which currency, or value language you’d like to use.
The US declaring the dollar legal tender is exactly the same as if they were to declare English the legal language. It’s an entirely non-enforceable declaration.
You would still speak Spanish if you wanted. Some people can only speak Spanish. Whole communities would.
The same way, some people only have Bitcoin. They only speak Bitcoin when it comes to value communication. This will be increasingly the case.
You are slightly deluded if you think that just declaring something (no matter who does so) has ever had much of an effect on anything.

It is not the question. Why would anyone want to cash out of a deflationary asset back into an inflationary one. (In many cases, hyper-inflationary..)
See, you misunderstand the value proposition here. We are not in Bitcoin like some sort of stock investment. The idea is not to “sell” for old money eventually.
Bitcoin is already somewhat spendable directly, and you can bet that more and more businesses, big and small, will gladly accept it as time goes on. Circular economies have and will continue to develop. 
The idea is to have a better money, a better store of value, forever. While watching fiat revert to it’s intrinsic value of zero. There is a book called Exit, Voice and Loyalty. I encourage you to read it. Bitcoin is a wonderful way of exiting a flawed financial system.
Of course it’s still a bit early for the simple minded (like yourself perhaps) to see this bigger picture. The adoption S curve will inflect eventually, as it did with the internet.
Don’t play yourself. This is a real generational wealth shift. It can’t be stopped, not by governments and not even by the most powerful global elite.
Gold looks neat but it lacks many of the advantages of Bitcoin. You can be physically robbed of your gold. Bitcoin can exist purely as a memory, in your brain. It’s not confiscate-able. Not to mention it’s easily infinitely divisible and can be sent globally over an unsecured network.

As far as I understand none of this has much to do with LN, so unless I'm missing something this is not a great analogy.
With LN you won't want to keep too much BTC tied up in lightning channels, so maybe that's sort of what you mean?
Otherwise your LN wallet shouldn't be any less secure than a regular bitcoin wallet, so use it the same?
The "debit tap with limits" is a good metaphor for how to manage spendable bitcoin in general, LN or not. Load up a software wallet weekly from savings on hardware (which requires at least a pin)

Bitcoin excels as a store of value. Which is a very valuable use case, particularly for individuals living in highly inflationary closed economies.
Bitcoin is not necessarily going to be a widely spendable currency, and that’s okay.
It will simply underly and denominate all other currencies and assets.

It really does none of the above honestly.
It just exposes your bearer instrument to unnecessary counter-party risk.
There is nothing simpler than setting up and using a hardware wallet. It’s easier and faster than any kind of online sign up, plus there are no contracts or signatures. Just write down some words. Sheesh what a myth.
Don’t sell and you don’t owe any tax. Easy.
You think some company and the government will allow your successors easy and full access to the funds as inheritance? You’re crazy. May as well take the coins with you.
There are self-managed solutions for inheritance that involve periodic signing. If you stop signing for long enough your funds can be spent by family. Easy.
Bitcoin is a bearer asset. If you don’t have the private key you have nothing. Period. Advocating for custodial accounts is foolish, shortsighted and indicates that you’ve completely missed the point of this new monetary paradigm.

Don’t you think she should sooner trust you than a multitude of banks and corporations?
I’d like to live in a world where people only need to trust themselves and those close to them. Especially when it comes to things like life savings.
The whole point of bitcoin is self-sovereignty.
That is why it’s valuable. Its a bearer asset that can be transacted in a decentralized manner.
If most people hold it with a custodian it may as well just be a shared, regulated database.
It’s easy to fall back or get stuck on existing custodial paradigms. It feels safer and easier. Especially when encouraging someone else to get involved. It’s insured. It’s familiar.
But you must realize that holding the keys is ALWAYS better. Even for the least technically inclined out there.
It’s worth it because doing so is the whole point.
If your SO just wants to invest in something with lots of potential upside, there are plenty of other stocks and such to pick from that are better suited for that.
You see where I’m coming from?
As soon as it’s not your Bitcoin, it may as well be any other speculative instrument held by a counter-party.
I do agree that it could affect price positively. But generally it’s bad for the ecosystem if too many people invest in funds like this.

I think this is a case of tunnel vision.
Every Bitcoin is not being bought with USDT.
This is a single (admittedly large) exchange.
Demand for Bitcoin is genuinely at an ATH and increasing. I and others are fully aware of this via metrics besides price, let alone the price on a single exchange.
Don’t kid yourself, this is Bitcoin. Just Hodl.
Also maybe close that short you likely have open. Your fudding won’t help it.

It’s not an app. He dreamt of a Bitcoin wallet integrated into Apple Pay.
Currently only credit cards can be added to Apple Pay.
Apple would have to integrate Bitcoin into both Apple Pay and the related merchant setup.
Perhaps what you mean, is that Apple is slowing opening developer access to to the NFC hardware. This will eventually allow existing Bitcoin wallets (and other banking apps) to perform NFC tap communications.

They’ll layoff all the paper pushers sure but that’s just the beginning of the end.
Banks using a blockchain for operations is an infrastructure inversion. Currently we have to ask them for access to our own funds, make transactions, etc. due to that data being inside their closed private systems.
Once a bank is “using a blockchain” (a real, public, distributed blockchain) they’re no longer the gatekeepers. They’re just another shit service on the network. One you can choose to use, or more likely, not.
Instead of choosing between like 5 (or less) local banks for non-blockchain financial services, we’ll have thousands of options, ranging from highly decentralized and trust-less solutions, to countless centralized services that plug into the blockchain and beg you for your business.
It’s so much more than automation and efficiency leading to job loss. That’s almost irrelevant. It’s more about creating an insanely competitive financial services landscape that benefits the many rather than the few.

Ok yeah so yeah imo you are still wrong about the possibility of things going tits up. You don’t seem to understand my point.
Bitcoin will outlive every living thing on planet earth for generations, even if WE go extinct.
Bitcoin is like a math formula, describing a perfect p2p exchange. Formulas, protocols, languages, these things can’t cease to exist once discovered.
You know? It’s like saying that if every single copy of Pythagoras theorem is destroyed and burned, triangles won’t be triangles anymore. It’s nonsense.
There will always be a copy of the bitcoin blockchain somewhere. Private keys can be in people’s brains.
That’s all that’s needed.
Even if the last copy of the blockchain is lost, we can all still use the protocol, beginning by competing to mine the first new block 
Bitcoin is the most resilient system in the universe. Because it’s based on pure math, which remains constant eternally.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:31:21

To answer your questions directly.
There will be no point where people are forced to use “such minuscule amounts” (eg 0.00000067). The apps and other software we use would represent that as “67 Sat” or something. Keeping it simple for us humans.
Its worth pointing out that traditional fiat currency does the exact same thing, just in the opposite direction. They are inflated towards infinity. Did you know that a coffee in Zimbabwe costs like 58 Quadrillion of the local currency? So people just carry 1 Trillion bills as pocket change.
Bitcoin doesn’t adjust for inflation. 
Remember inflation is something that occurs to other currencies. They are printed or typed into computers to no end. This means that the value of any given inflationary currency continuously decreases relative to everything else. Food, other currencies and Bitcoin all included.
Think about it this way. Before computers and crypto, when more money was needed in circulation it was far easier to print another price of paper, rather than cut the existing bills into ever smaller pieces. Hence inflation.
Software can handle infinitely small amounts of Bitcoin, representing and transact them in a human readable way.
This is novel. This effectively “solves” inflation, or negates the need to inflate in order to increase circulation.
Make sense fam?

It’s not. It’s a leftover from the times where people worked  a single job their whole life. This loyalty was rewarded at retirement via a 401k.
These days it’s just a sham where you work for less money now, so that you can (maybe) withdraw it from your pension when you’re eighty with seconds left to live.

Remember that Bitcoin is a protocol. Protocol is a fancy word for a language that computers can use to communicate directly with one another.
It’s just like English or any other human language.
You could write a bitcoin transaction on paper, same way you’d write an English essay. You could even do all the math to sign it with your private key right there on the page as well.
You could hand that paper to someone like a cheque and they could broadcast it to the network whenever they’d like, proving their new ownership of those coins to the rest of the world.
Net neutrality is about internet service providers allowing access (or faster access) to one website/server over another.
There are no bitcoin servers. There is nothing for an internet provider to throttle or block. A bitcoin transaction can be indistinguishable from any other data flowing through a network.
Bitcoin exchanges or other services do have servers that could be throttled or blocked. But those companies are simply bridges onto the Bitcoin network. 
Once a person has bitcoin held by a key they control, no one can possibly censor them. You could send someone a bitcoin transaction encoded as like 16 emojis, or as a picture of a cat. A bitcoin transaction is just pure information, again it’s like speaking a language. No internet? Speak the bitcoin language over FM radio or something! As long as a node eventually sees the transaction and shares it, the coins can change ownership.
Bitcoin is a protocol, parallel to and on the same level as the base internet protocols. Bitcoin doesn’t ride on top of the internet, it is it’s own network protocol.
Tl;dr: Net neutrality is, for all intents and purposes irrelevant to the Bitcoin protocol.

I often have to explain this exact feedback loop to people when discussing Bitcoin speculation.
They presume there is some kind of equivalent counteracting price force, usually described as such: “well as price goes higher more people will just want to sell”.
I tell them they’re right. Except unlike comparable commodities, the selling is incredibly limited.
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:36:30
On the surface, or day by day I would agree, totally separate conversations.
However from a macro or long term perspective, I think these two conversations are deeply intertwined.
The way a blockchain works determines aspects such as the monetary policy (or distribution) and function(s) of it’s native currency, right?
User (or speculator) behavior, and therefore exchange rate is driven by these aspects of the chain.
Like if a blockchain had a supply cap of only 10 coins and those coins provided some form of valued utility, one could safely assume a relatively high exchange rate per coin.
If that same blockchain was designed to have a 1 million coin supply cap, the exchange rate would be a million times lower.
How a blockchain works literally defines how speculators interpret and trade the coin in the long term. Just my 2 ‘toshis

@_date: 2017-10-26 17:07:37
Yes, precisely.
Of course technically it’s inflating as of now, since new coins are being ‘minted’ and awarded to the miner of each new block.
But each halving reduces that reward by half, leading to an asymptote that plateaus at 21 million.
At some point, the daily # of coins lost on accident will surpass the daily # of new coins minted, at which point Bitcoin will actually be deflationary.
I tend to think of it as deflationary already simply because it’s guaranteed to be so in the not-too-distant future.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:57:26

@_date: 2017-10-21 04:02:26
The idea that Bitcoin is like some kind of long term binary option based on its success as a currency is shortsighted.
Listen. New technologies almost exclusively follow S-curves. S curves start slowly, then accelerate rapidly before decelerating and plateauing near their peak.
Bitcoin is a new technology. It is following an S-curve.
Traditional assets (stocks, whatever) aren’t new technologies. They don’t go through new adoption phases. They get pumped (sometimes for decades) but then fall back into relative equilibrium with other things. 
Bitcoin is a new technology like the internet. The internet didn’t get adopted and then dumped. It just gets adopted more and more. Bitcoin will just be adopted more and more. Following an S-curve.

That’s real neato. You miss the point. Whatever a 401k is, you don’t actually HAVE one. People are promising you one. Weak promises on many levels. It only takes a few of those people to fuck you over. On top of that it is denominated in a fiat currency that will inflate to nothing.
A 401k is an incredibly insecure way to store wealth for the future, believe it or not.
Enjoy the 3% APR lol

nope, money is the killer application for distributed trust.  Smart contract “Ecosystems and communities” require trust in external factors, missing the point.

It’s just active trading vs passive investing.
Most active traders lose out relative to passive investors in any market.
Bitcoin price behaves sort of like the SP500 of crypto (I know it’s not an index, just in terms of price behavior..)
Just buy and hold Bitcoin. Passive. Simple. Winning.

@_date: 2017-10-22 06:06:39
Or perhaps you are dangerously misguided.
Other cryptos are barely comparable to Bitcoin aside from the crypto part. Be it the simplicity of the protocol, the value of the bounty on breaking it and most notably the market penetration, infrastructure and ecosystem development. Other cryptos are magnitudes behind and are highly unlikely to achieve the same network effects.
Just like websites, cryptos follow a power law. Top ~20% of cryptos will be ~80% of total market cap.
And the top coin (evidently Bitcoin, keep dreaming) will be magnitudes more valuable than the second coin, and so forth.
Bitcoin is like the Google.com of blockchains.
Some people think it’s too early to call this, I say they aren’t doing the research and they probably own tons of alts lol.

The key is pre-defined, immutable monetary policy / currency supply. That in itself is invaluable.

Um no. There is no such thing as easy access to real capital.
You say allow as if there is capital just sitting somewhere that we haven’t been “allowed” to use yet.

What do you think would happen if everyone tried to "cash out" of the trillions of global derivatives and debt based instruments? There isn't nearly enough M1 supply.
The whole point of Bitcoin is to replace fiat money, be a better store of value and eventually be traded directly for real assets - not cashed out for fiat..
Anyone who refers to Bitcoin as "magic internet currency" should check their ego and do some learning. Maybe read a couple white papers. You'll eat those words when your pension disappears, the banks close and you push wheelbarrows of worthless cash around like they do in Venezuela.

This rise is fundamentally different than previous Bitcoin bubbles. Rather than being driven by zero exchange fees or fractional exchanges, this is driven by steady global maturation of infrastructure, allowing for a steady influx of new buyers, while supply has been dwindling as new and old holders alike refuse to sell.
The market cap is high enough that huge swings and bubbles require large amounts of capital. Those amounts are only on the buy side - since institutional investors buy and hold for long timeframes.
This has been a slow and steady rise in price, accurately reflecting global sentiment and speculation.
It will continue, gradually, to well over 10,000 USD.
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:01:56
Or is the big rise just beginning.

Your response is incredibly narrow and shortsighted, with the classic developed country bias.
Dismissing this as another fad or bubble is the easy and defendable response. I understand that.
The issues and exchange rate factors you outline are true.
Note that a minority of volume happens on the online exchange sites. Underground markets in inflation rekt countries are huge. LocalBitcoins is huge. There are people selling houses in my area asking for Bitcoin.
Without a doubt cycles will continue for all manner of reasons with economic ebbs and flows.
Deflationary currency is incredibly attractive to everyone involved. Why would it hinder adoption?
It's important to realize what Bitcoin could replace and is competing against in the long term. Centralized stock markets? Government bonds never to be repaid? Sovereign paper currency? Inflated real estate markets?
I'll take Bitcoin thanks. What kind of magical non-internet assets are you buying?
