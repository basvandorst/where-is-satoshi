I fucking love this. I love Bitcoin. This is the most cyberpunk thing that has ever happened. I love following this every day. I love being invested in it.
Also, I AM Satoshi Nakamoto

That sounds awesome. I'll be ordering it. I want to establish a process for making offline paper wallets, but it always seemed just a *tiny* bit too inconvenient so I keep procrastinating getting on the learning curve.  Your paper wallets are so nice to look at. I wonder if printer drivers are an additional aspect I'll need to handle somehow?

I can't predict if people would be interested in buying them with Bitcoin, but I will say this:
I just converted my apartment entirely to LED lighting, and THEY'RE AMAZING. My main room has seven ceiling fixtures - four dimmable and three non-dimmable. I put in 100w equivalent spotlights in all of them. Each draws about 15 watts at full brightness. The entire room now draws 105 watts. The brightness and quality of the light is stunning! I also have three in the kitchen drawing 45 watts, and four 40w equivalents in the bathroom shower fixture drawing about 30 watts.
They generate barely any heat. You can put your hand right on them and feel the mildest warmth. All the lights are designed to last 22 years at normal use.
If you're thinking of getting LED lights, DO IT. One seventh the electricity cost and 22 years of not changing bulbs? It's kind of a no-brainer. The brightness boost alone is going to do wonders for my depression during the Seattle winter.

Kudos for publicizing Bitcoin. I saw some people commenting here that you sent coins to yourself or something - is that meritless?

I'd cash out right now if it was at $1,000,000.
