Thank you so much for this, OP!  Made me so happy to see that somebody is kind enough to do this!
We created Seeds Tokens ( to allow tokenholders to ask the blockchain for help - and receive it - no strings attached.
In part because 96%+ of the BTC wealth is held by 4% of the addresses - perpetuating the same wealth disparity challenge in fiat - we're working to be mindful of doing whatever we can to get Seeds Tokens in the hands of as many diverse groups of people as possible.  
Each tokenholder can then makes a Needs Request to our system of front-end products, which have been integrated into about 30 apps, and it will be gifted to him/her, no strings attached.  It's a bit like a decentralized GoFundMe.
In 2013, I sold off my personal BTC holding to keep Seeds going when investors were ignoring us, often at least in part because of misogyny in institutionalized finance.
Now, I want to solve the problem of lack of funds due to discrimination - for all of us.  I believe we've found an effective way to do this at scale through the Seeds tokens vehicle.
However, we are not a non-profit, which was a philosophic choice.  I think the non-profit/for-profit binary was manufactured primarily for tax reasons in the US, and it has unfortunately led to rampant greed and zero-sum thinking in the for-profit space in too many cases, and lack of resourcing and efficiency in the non-profit sector in too many cases as well.
I believe Seeds can transcend that, creating a new paradigm - a system of abundance.
If this resonates with you, we'd be so grateful if you would be interested in engaging with us in whatever capacity feels appropriate to you.  
Regardless, thank you so much again for doing what you do!  Happy Holidays!

This wasn't Paypal's decision - note that Eobot is the sole source of this information.
I spoke with Paypal on the phone regarding my refunded transfer from Eobot.  Paypal explained to me that they, in fact, did not initiate the transfer.  Eobot did.
Eobot also initiated this refund at an incredibly convenient time for themselves (or himself?  Is Eobot one dude?).  They liquidated my Litecoin balance, which was worth around $15K, without my knowledge or consent, and then claimed that it was Paypal who did this....and then they refunded me the $400 or so  with which I initially made my LTC purchase.
We have documentation from Paypal confirming that it was Eobot, and not Paypal, who chose to initiate the USD refunds.
We've also filed a complaint with the BBB, and are in the process of filing a lawsuit against Eobot.  If you're interested in more information, please DM me.
Edit: Spacing

I was in the same situation and it seemed incredibly fishy that my Eobot Litecoin balance vanished days before the "45 day refund period" had ended, which was also days after it had increased in value 20x my purchase price.
I called Paypal, and they confirmed that if in fact was not Paypal who initiated the refund.
Eobot initiated the refund.  They then sold our Litecoin and made a big time profit in USD.
On your Paypal refund receipt, is it a 'Note from Merchant' that claims that Paypal forced the refund?  If so, the Merchant who wrote that note would obviously have been Eobot.
We've filed a complaint with the BBB, and will be bringing a lawsuit against Eobot as well to reclaim the USD amount of Litecoin at its peak, plus interest.  If you're interested in joining, we'd be happy to talk more - just DM me.  Thanks.

Thank you for saying you're sorry about my experience.
I think what you say re: "horror stories" relating to "every other major company" is exactly the problem - crypto is supposed to be about transcending that nonsense, because it saves us from being forced to interact with shitty third parties.
Many, many people have had trouble with Coinbase.  Tweeting at them is a joke.  They're so non-responsive and/or degrading that people get discouraged and give up.  They simply don't give a fuck about customers, unless the customers are vocal enough and the press (and therefore the consequences) are bad enough.  This makes them like every abuser of power in the history of the world.
I'd gladly participate in a lawsuit against Coinbase, and there are many like me.  But they shouldn't have forced us to have to even consider going to the trouble....

ah, interesting.  thanks for the insight!

ha yay fuck coinbase

What debit card are you guys using?  I have a Shift card, which I would not recommend, but they're shutting it down anyway.

In 2013 I ran into Brian Armstrong at a bar in San Francisco.  I went up to him and was like, 'Brian, the bugs on your platform cost me thousands of dollars, and when I foresaw issues and proactively tried to reach out to customer service about not getting fills, etc., as well as messaging Fred on Reddit (because that was the more reliable way to get a response then), nobody got back to me for a month.'  Later on, their errors ended up costing me well into the 6 figures, right.
Brian goes, 'That was a very stressful time in my life.  Here, I'll send you $10 in BTC on Coinbase right now.'
His first response was to talk about himself and how hard his life was....no empathy for how his shitty site negatively impacted me, somebody he was making money off of, etc.
Fuck that guy.  After that interaction, it was crystal clear that he didn't give a fuck about customers.  When people are like that, sooner or later, their customers disappear.  I will gleefully look on as that happens.

I'm eager to stop having a bank account at all, and Zelle is fucking terrible.  
Hmm, maybe it wouldn't be that hard to create my own debit card for this...
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:45:27
He's not smart, though.  
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:12:45
...my comment is (obviously) tongue-in-cheek.  BTC's scarcity is arguably the least "valuable" thing about its design, which is the reason subsequent coins looking to improve upon it didn't replicate this.
That said, thank you for once again confirming the shitty quality of too many people in this Godforsaken sub.
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:52:10
She thinks it's valuable because it's scarce?

My understanding is that you pay capital gains at the time you sell the item for capital, so the time/location at which the item was acquired shouldn't matter.

I wasn't even thinking in terms of ROI, was thinking in terms of the technology.

Yes...and other cryptos are better than Bitcoin.

Coinbase fucking sucks

...dude tried to have people murdered...no evidence that he was "framed," and the busted-being-logged-in thing was the purest idiocy of which I have ever heard.  This uncool, privileged, not-that-smart person got what was coming for him.  Many, many non-white people are in jail for much longer than this for less.  Seeing this petition grosses me out, is a lot of what's wrong with the crypto community and the demographic of which it's currently comprised.  The community needs to be better than this.

This person is terrible.  As a person, I mean.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:47:26
Exactly...while actual children who are black get treated as though they're "adults," often when committing far lesser crimes.  The sentiment revealed with the "he was just a 29 year old" thing is racist as fuck.  So disgusted.

It's the total value of all the Bitcoins available, and currently it's something like $2.6 billion or so.
Note: If/when the market cap hits $1 trillion (not implausible - it was at $1.5 million in January 2011, and $1 trillion is 1/15 the size of the US economy.  There are also $30 trillion in offshore accounts, so just need a portion of that to flow in...) each Bitcoin will be worth about $47,000.

Please don't compare Aaron to this moron.  Nowhere near the same caliber of mind.  Also, it's Swartz\*.

More likely it's a pullback because inexperienced traders, who wanted/thought it would go straight to $300 with zero pullbacks, got freaked out and started selling.
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:16:21
@_date: 2013-10-24 04:30:37
Well, that's simply not accurate.
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:44:46
What do you mean?  Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:54:56
How did you get them to respond to you?  What email did you use?  I've been trying to get through for weeks, and have received a single, unhelpful reply.  Very frustrated with them, and missed orders at $155 and $169ish that I very much want filled.  Thanks in advance for the insight.
