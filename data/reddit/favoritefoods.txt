You can manage multiple Bitcoin wallets on the Ledger Nano S just by clicking "add an account" on the Ledger Bitcoin Chrome app. There's also the passphrase option on the Ledger itself which makes completely new wallets that are only accessible with the passphrase.

Lost bitcoin can't be retrieved if nobody has the private key. The way your idea would work is by having the receiver be required to sign to receive the transaction. This would protect against sending to an address that nobody owns. The con to this system is just that you have to keep track of all your received transactions or else they get refunded. Also, coins will still be lost when someone no longer controls the private key. To prevent that, you'd have to require manual maintenance; some way to prove ownership, say once a month, which would be tedious and a little stressful. Actually, that part would just become automated anyway, so I don't know how it would work.

I recommend eventually getting a hadware wallet, such as a Ledger Nano S, which should work fine with a Chromebook. It's official apps are Chrome apps also it also can be used with MyEtherWallet. By using a hardware wallet, you never have to worry about your private keys being stolen.

The passphrase acts like a 25th word for your seed, so all of the wallets that it generates will be completely new. Your seed words and private keys will never be exposed to any device you plug your Nano S into. 
A passphrase doesn't actually add more security (a random 24 word seed already has 256 bits of entropy, same as a bitcoin private key), it's just a way to make separate wallets or provide a means of plausible deniability in the event someone acquires your 24 word seed (you'd have a tiny amount in there and the rest in your passphrase wallet).

It depends, and the price points will be based on your own technical and/or fundamental analysis.

You don't need $25B to be sold, only the current market to value everything $25B less. The low volume only makes the valuation less valid after some time. It isn't whales selling.

Well, it isn't. There are people who bought back in 2010-2011 and turned hundreds into millions. If you bought right now, it could still end up dropping to $3k or lower somehow, and recover to new highs a year later.

It's the same as trading stocks, except way more volatile. You could just as easily lose your money. $10 of BTC at $6000 sold at $6150 would make you 25 cents profit.

Not sure if this is what you're asking, but if you put Electrum on a flash drive and use it on a computer, it's no safer than using Electrum from your hard drive. If you're asking about using a Ledger or Trezor with Electrum, that's perfectly safe; Electrum can't see the private keys.

You only need to use GDAX if you want to trade or you want to buy there so you don't pay Coinbase fees (GDAX limit orders are $0 fee). Transferring to another online wallet doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Get a hardware wallet, such as a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor.

What kind of human do you think watches a video like this and wants to subscribe?

You mean 852 BTC. You misread 1000 as 1. I'm guessing your country uses commas for decimals.

The private keys are generated from the seed. The seed is all you need.

For ERC20 tokens, there's EtherDelta, which is decentralized. For normal exchanges, I don't remember exactly which ones, but a lot of the smaller ones don't require any actual identity verification. Check out ones like hitbtc, yobit, liqui, and cryptopia.

Because GDAX is Coinbase (which I believe is where they purchased), except you pay much lower fees or zero fees, depending if it's a market order or a limit order.

I use a Ledger Nano S and have my seed written down and memorized. The amount of written copies is up to you, but I don't trust printers. Just make sure you'll still have your seed/keys if your house burns down or you're robbed; and whoever robs you won't have what they need to recover your keys.

Usually when someone asks a forum how to do a thing, they're not the kind of person who will be able to do that thing. I think you have a lot of research and work to do.

You already named the reasons. I like that Ledger supports more coins and is working on adding even more.

Coinbase sometimes takes over an hour to transfer.

People have done polls before. The majority are in the 20-35 range.

Yeah, but they're trying to avoid fees, and the limits would be too low anyway.

Are you referring to "Bitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend"? (which you read incorrectly) That post was from the actual Satoshi Nakamoto.
