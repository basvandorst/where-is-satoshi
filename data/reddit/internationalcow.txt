They don't let you link canadian debit cards. I know how to use a wallet but it would be really convenient to have an app that let me buy coins instantly with a debit card/my bank account.

I'm selling some of my coin locally today. Someone agreed to current price -5%. What's a fair exchange rate to use given coinbase and gdax shitting the bed right now?

Coin base is flat under $100 and then % based iirc. It also doesn't support selling in canada

You'll still lose ~$8 on the transaction fee and then 3-4% on paypal exchange rates. C'est la vie. Now you know for any future buy ins.

When I decided I wanted to sell today it was at a little over 16k but I'm just wondering at where to draw the line for the sale.

I'd be concerned about Zellepay's policy regarding fraud. If the payment was made indirectly using stolen CC info, they may charge you after the chargeback goes through.

You screwed yourself by trying to day trade bitcoin with $50 when the transaction fees right now on that amount are about 20% of your $50 right now. 
If you need the money, just make a kijiji ad and sell it locally. Your gains will be negligible after the transaction fee in terms of $$ but from a % standpoint, probably decent considering you have bought a short time ago. 
In the future, do research into the thing you're investing in. More traditional investments have things like early withdrawal penalties etc. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose, bitcoin could have crashed 40% just as easily as it gained. 
If you don't need the money, just hold onto it and check it again after a year.
