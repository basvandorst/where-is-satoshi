Just remember my giant gain in profit came from the massive spikes a couple months ago. Honestly, I would’ve made more money if I did a lump sum at that time. In my opinion, using a combination of buying single large purchases and buying over time is the best bet.
For example, if you bought a large amount and the value dropped then you would have lost money. But if you combined that with smaller payments over time then your loss would be a lot less substantial and would set you up to make even more when the price spikes again.

I’ve been buying 50 bucks a week for the past 4 months now. Have spent about $600 and have made roughly $600 over time.

Yup. I'm thinking about changing my buy orders to daily and monitoring it more frequently now.

This. I'd recommend it to anyone who is still relatively new to all of this.. Good way to learn and still be apart of the action.
