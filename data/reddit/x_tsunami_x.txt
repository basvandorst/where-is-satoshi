Extremely suspect, do not donate your BTC to this as it reeks of a SCAM!
Instead sent me your BTC and I will forward it to the right peeps....honest.... I’m not lying....

It’s possible as I had accidentally put a 3 sat/B which didn’t confirm for 2 weeks, I paid a mining pool to accelerate my transaction for $60... big mistake never to be repeated. 
And I didn’t set Replace-by-fee on the original TX so no way to top the fees!
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:35:02
Those times was more about establishing the technology and driving awareness of crypto, upsetting governments, evangelising and building community’s 
Now BTC is more mainstream than ever, the technology hasn’t caught up to demand! 
Like I said I love BTC and what it stands for but I will weather the storm and hope core stands up and provides some roadmap to address this issue (not TABS) 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:34:42
Whilst I hope your comments come to fruition, being a long term HODL since 2014 I now have doubt, unless core fix the TX fee’s and scaling issues (LN aside) I fear for BTC’s future.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:36:41
Fully agree, my worry is this is a consistent issue...high fees and long confirmation times are worrying!
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:41:58
Useful reply!

Actually I’m interested! How much are you looking for and do you have any pics?

Is it really that easy to be banned?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:40:16
Agree start with 2MB and monitor network performance and unconfirmed TX
I know Segwit was supposed to be the saviour but until all exchanges/ wallets move to this standard then I don’t see much impact short term

Hahaha..little far for me to travel...UK -&gt; Australia 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:42:39
I think there is a lot of negativity at the moment around BTC, I believe in BItcoin but am frustrated with the technological progress from core!
Increase the block size to 2MB, monitor the network performance (confirmation times) and see what impact this has to fee’s and times! I’m not saying go to 8MB like BCH!

Open an account with Santander as they still accept reference numbers. Then just use faster payment method (instant bank transfer) between them or switch banks to another and provide feedback to NatWest that the reasoning behind the switch is because I can't buy bitcoins so your taking your business elsewhere! F&amp; em!

Disagree completely, I would say anyone that bought  during 2012 and even after mt gox crash, then carried on purchasing coin and going through the ups and downs of Bitcoin should be classed as a long timer...

Thank you for the reassurance man.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:50:55
I never spend only receive, I know my public key is out there as it's visible in the blockchain transactions that anyone can view but splitting the public addresses may hide how many BTC I have received over the years reducing my chances of an attack.
I also store my wallet offline and never on internet connected machines. I may briefly connect to sync the blockchain and receive my new BTC, I buy tiny amounts weekly but reuse the same Bitcoin Core public address

I'm looking into hardware wallets but for now I have an external enclosure with the blockchain downloaded and wallet stored on it, I also have the wallet file on other storage mediums for backup! I know I'm running a risk but my sync machine is only connected briefly to he internet to sync the blockchain to the external enclosure then disconnected from the internet (nothing is stored on the sync machine)

Labor, don't forget the peeps running around fixing all that tech
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:09:55
My question to you is are you willing to lose that amount of money? If not then I would buy small and regularly so you can watch the price and maybe buy more when the price is low, at the moment the price is rising due to potential hype around the ETF, if the ETF is not approved then the price will take a hit then buy some more coinage.
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:05:19
What's wrong with our nonsense, actually find it quite amusing! I do agree though asking questions and getting an informed and helpful answer without our nonsense is useful

Going to create a coin just for you, DICKCOIN make sure you HODL a lot as I feel it reflects your mentality

Dude that sucks, I'm a BTC buyer through U.K sites (bitbargain etc) and without you guys buying BTC would be a right pain in the arse!
Hopefully you'll find another option, good luck.

Good job man! Shame your leaving the community but you got to have fun in life right!
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:35:14
Nah far from it fella! However the principle is sound on cashing out your initial investment
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:51:45
I wouldn’t say the money is gone per say! You could always cash out your initial capital say in a year or two if  the value of BTC increases and let’s be honest it has so far! I’ve been into BTC for 5 years as yes there are ups and downs but these tend to pail into significance over the general gains of BTC. I think I cashed out just my initial investment back in 2014 before mtgox crash and the rest I’m riding to the moon
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:57:02
You do realise you don’t own those coins, no private key no coinage!
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:31:03
Also this is one for my favourite films he has directed and produced (non Star Trek related)
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:10:06
What proof would you require? I can of course get him to come on to Reddit and do an AMA!
I have taken the action to fundraise for him, he directs and produces films and isn’t in the know when it comes to crypto
This is his own Bitcoin address setup by me for him, 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:54:57
Dude chill out! I normally buy cash, why should it bother you so much! Been in crypto a long time and sometimes it’s easier to buy with a credit card if I pay it off the end of the month!
You telling me you have never bought anything on credit even for a short while!
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:02:52
My thoughts are it’s either one of two things
1. They feel crypto in general is a threat and want to stop easy access for ppl buying BTC or any other cypto
2. Ppl have spent large amounts on their credit card thinking they could pay it off with the price rising and as we know that’s not been the case recently so has left a lot of folks in debt with no way of paying it off
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:35:27

I’ll bring Visa and MasterCard In...gits
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:11:51
Yes the charge was refunded and I know I won’t be using a credit card, I’ll just pay with bank transfer next time but it’s more about the check of VISA and MasterCard mandating vendors and sellers to change the code which hasn’t been the case since I’ve been in bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:05:07
Errr ok, thanks for the smart advice. 
It’s wasn’t about buying it with a credit card or not, it’s about what is happening in this space regarding the big banks and credit card vendors
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:37:29
From my bank and bittylicious (crypto selling platform)
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:10:05
Dude everyone knows you transact BTC with smoke signals... rookie mistake
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:41:14
You have to wait for a least 6 confirmations from the network, this all depends on the transaction fee that was applied when the BTC was sent to you! I'm assuming a very low fee hence the delay!!
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:47:09
Subscribed, nice for us U.K. HODLers
