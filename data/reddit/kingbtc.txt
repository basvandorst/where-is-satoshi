Bitcoin is the most efficient way of transacting currency. Secure, quick, ubiquitous, and programmable. If the US bans bitcoin, any other nation can use it to be more efficient in their economic processes. (Whoever bans it will be at a disadvantage) Some of the largest industries on this planet can benefit from alternative money systems (sex &amp; drugs), so Bitcoin can co-exist along with them.

I don't think it is latency of a point to point connection, but latency when considering the time it takes to have valid block data to start mining the next block. In mining milliseconds count, and the more time it takes to transfer data from miner to miner the more time lost losing potential profit.

As a business owner I could look at profits and revenue on a daily basis. Goods sold could be marked for replacement via internet, payment sent via bitcoin. My supplier would have a daily snapshot of inventory, sales, and production needs and could notify the manufacturers of this information, send bitcoin, receive goods. (if this middle man is still deemed viable, we might go producer to consumer) You see everything is happening on a daily basis as opposed to weekly or monthly. The money spent up the line is immediately put into revenue generating operations, and profit would be put into interest bearing accounts, stocks, bonds, savings, etc. (more investment, immediately) Information, planning, and investment is what allows businesses to expand and grow, by having this information as close to real time allows for more efficient operation.
If it takes me 30 days to pay my bill, that money sits idle during that time period, inventory and production might be behind by 30 days, planning becomes more difficult and supply might not meet demand causing inefficiencies.

@_date: 2015-11-23 02:53:58
They can make it illegal for retailers to accept, but then other countries that do embrace bitcoin will have significant economic advantages. Being able to transmit value instantly and securely will give willing participants a clear advantage over traditional systems.
Think of it this way, I want to buy a new shovel, so I got the store and buy a new shovel with btc, that revenue, minus the profit then gets forwarded to the shovel maker in preparation for the next batch of shovels to be made (and I am given one off the warehouse shelf to restock today via truck), the shovel manufacturer takes their cut, and forwards the remaining btc to the raw materials companies. All the while ever business is paying their employees, today, in btc. There are no banks involved, so fees and overhead are dramatically reduced, and the velocity of money is increase significantly. Many people will state 'oh I have no fees to make payments', but that is merely because fees are coming from some other source. Anytime you see a big banking building, just think of the in-efficiency that building represents.
In the existing system the money is tied up for a couple days before it is transmitted from person to person, and companies need to keep reserves so they can pay employees while waiting for their own payment.

Economies don't actually need control, economies 'effectively' limited themselves for thousands of years before the invention of monetary policy and central banking, after which we had the Great Depression and the Great Recession, but I digress.
Currencies are just a medium by which exchange takes place, nothing more, nothing less. People are just accustomed to using whatever is common. The way government manipulate monetary policy is something much more nefarious and deceptive. If no nationally recognized currency existed, other currencies certainly would exist.

It is almost counter the benefits of a blockchain. Banks will have incentive to build more miners to achieve 51% mining share to cheat their own system. Thus there is a race to put mine each other for a private token.
