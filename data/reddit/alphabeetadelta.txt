Looks interesting. I don't mind about BTC prices. Don't know what's the volume/liquidity like. More importantly, don't know how easy is it to deposit and withdraw?

$5M... way beyond my imagination.

Very interesting. Definitely going to check it out. Will need to make myself familiar with CFDs first. 
I'm in USA, and am primarily interested in call and put options to dip my toe.

Looks like this thread is a gold mine!!!
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:59:06
That's a good point. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:17:24
Thanks for the helpful suggestions. Will try them out. I was concerned my bank account being associated with bitcoin, that's why i was using Paypal.

Yeah, well  I am new to all this, and I didn't specifically asked for friends and family payment, they did it that way themselves and I didn't think much of it. Unfortunately didn't give much thought then of having proof, so don't have anything saying that I was paid using such and such email address. In any case, if the claim is somebody misused another person's email address I don't know if Papal would help me in this case. Lessons learnt (expensive!)

Agreed, most of the comments here seemed to be righteous people looking to criticize instead of providing productive suggestions.
The thing is this is the second time I have been duped, and first one was supposedly the biggest exchange. I guess, such is life.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:31:30
I didn't realize there was such a thing. I only had heard of buyer protection.

Thanks for the kind words. Teaching is exactly what I was looking for.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:21:00
Any suggestions?

I was under the impression that the only exchange where I can get cash in USD was coinbase. Obviously this is based on some old information. I need to do some more research. Thanks for the suggestions.

Any tips on what strengthens the case? I suppose I can't tell them that the payment was for bitcoins. As far as I understand Paypal discourages bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:18:35
Much much more, but, "whatever".

1 thing I know you could do with Bitcoins that the article fails to mentions is others on reddit, but I don't know if it works. I nice redditor tipped me once, but I didn't get anything. Otherwise today I could also have boasted that I own bitcoins....:(

Way to go...I could see this post becoming one of the most "golded" post.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:44:08
That's incorrect...0% margin right now is just as to acquire more customers in order to drive sales to the target $850k.

I have tried coinbase. Two problems with coinbase:
1. Only market trades.
2. Most of the time they have exceeded their daily limits, so 9 times out of 10 you can't use them to buy anything.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:08:58
woah. That's true. Now it shows I can buy them...Unfortunately it seems to be only allowing market orders. No limit orders ???
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:09:22
well currently coinbase seems to have exceeded their buying capacity (???). The next purchase is available on Thursday!!!
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:30:08
well thank you very much...you're my Bit Santa for the day :P
