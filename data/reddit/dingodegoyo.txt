I am choosing not to take my business there because of what i think of their actions as a business.

That should tell us how correct we are. 
The ideological superstructure of the old-paradigm is being caught with its pants down time and time again.
They are incorrect and unbeknownest to them the economic basis of their society is sliding out from under them. We are revealing the truths of this new economic shift and its new ideological battles and actors.

Its a deliberate investigation of the 14k people in the united states who have large asset holdings. Its clearly after the surplus not the damned tax the detailed IRS investigation is whole reason behind this.

It contradicts it at this stage of its growth as its economic basis, which it could stably reflect the valuation of, is small. 
It is growing however and it will only be fully itself as  a currency when it achieves total self-reproduction as capital. 
For the snake to eat its own tail so to speak.
Forgive me if i am wrong this is the extent of my understanding based on my theoretical background, which is not all in STEM!

Are you familiar with hegelian marxism?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:08:11
I mean to be honest i was 15 and just wanting to buy drugs off the silkroad when i bought in early 2012. I didnt touch it for 5 years and now that im 20 i still have some btc left over that i intend to hold. Heck my Dad has some too when i convinced him to invest, in an effort to get him to send me money for drugs, well he did and what he had left over in his wallet is worth a tidy sum now too.
