I voted. No brainer. Chose bitcoin option. That's almost one full coin for today's price. 10 years from now I would probably just retire and watch every Arsenal's game live. :)

The best time to buy bitcoin is anytime. We can argue about what is the best time to sell.

@_date: 2017-12-06 14:55:47
Agreed. It could be even better. All indicators out there are showing that the market is far from saturated.

Lol. I thought I see Roger Ver among the audiences? I can't be the only one, right?!
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:46:36
Thanks, I just ordered his books. His reply on Rver tweet just made it clear that Andreas is the pure and sincere one, instead of the corrupted and greedy one.

Those criminals are just trying every ways possible to harm bitcoin!

Just think about it, Bitmain sells BTC ASIC Miner and only accepts payment in BCH. That sums it up.

I respect your stance. But we need a healthy environment to grow.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:17:56
I know right. He should've added: "OR ELSE..."
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:00:26
Oh my goodness... he is exposing his true self.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:55:02
Can't you see it? He just care about his own agenda. It really shows in that tweet.
Unfortunately, it coincides with some technical discussion that would confuse people...
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:49:55
That said, I have no problem of Bitcoin being more of store of value and still using alt coins for small transactions. Of course, what I mean here is legit alt coins, like Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:20:48
Yeah, sorry about that. But the recent attacks and current propaganda from the other side just make everyone fed up.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:37:42
Dont be fooled. The reality is he was being sarcastic to himself. He mentioned store of value and now he wants bigger blocks, you are right. They are contradictory, unless he wants Bitcoin not to be store of value, and Crash (as in CH) in the near future.

As long as it is about Bitcoin, I am not too concerned.
Bitmain, BTC ASIC miners, only accepts payment in BCH. For me, that sums it all.
I just can't wait to see more competition on the ASIC miners.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:30:03
ALRIGHT, here is my simple question:
IF he (you, if you are with him) can implement and get anything he (they, if you are with him) wants in BCH, 
WHY would he even bother BTC? 
You can always stick with your idealism with your newly forked shitcoin. Am I right?
Answer it with your clean and honest heart. Don't talk shit about technology. This is all about greed.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:13:06

Market share and market cap is open ended right now. All I see is that it is growing. Bitcoin has not adapted for all these years and yet I do not see it is dying.

OK I will delete. I just got too excited..
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:57:24
Try with small amount first. Let us know the results! I think risk associated with cross exchange trading is the price uncertainty and delays. You can definitely try tho :D Good luck!

Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

@_date: 2017-11-14 00:43:42
Or you just need to use alternatives (read: alt coins), nobody can prevent you to do just that. Please note that recent spike in transaction fees is the result of intentional and inorganic dirty attacks.

Just unsubscribe that subreddit of BitCHes. I guarantee you'll feel better, at least I do :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:33:37
Good analogy.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:18:39
I think this block size problem can be explained perfectly with an analog of how you would develop an oil field. People who is in the oil business will understand clearly what I am trying to convey here.
Your company made a discovery and now you have a proven oil reserves (read: BTC price, market share &amp; cap, future potential growth) that you want to develop. 
Actually, lets say it was not a company, it was discovered by people that have the goal to benefit the community at large. However, later there are several big companies also invested to also get some chunk of the pizza.
Generally, you can go either one of these two simplified scenarios:
1. Pump the oil at the highest rate possible to achieve maximum short term profit for the company (big investors with big capitals). However, it is almost certain that you will shorten the life of the field because you will hit an unavoidable increase of water cut, hence lower oil production, from that point onwards the production of your field will only be declining. You can intervene with artificial lift, EOR, etc but not for long. You will crash eventually.
2. Think longterm, don't be greedy, be patient, enjoy the moment. Put a cap in the production rate to ensure stable, steady, and predictable growth or even a plateau of production that will extend the life of the field. This way, you will get more of the juice simple because you avoid the water coning problem.
Sorry for the long comment. I hope you enjoy it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:34:13
Nodes are where the blockchain is stored and synced. If it is connected to the internet (network) then it will be automatically synced with the latest transactions. Miners job is to confirm the transactions with the sha256 algorithm and to decide whether the node is valid or not. Lets say, for example if you try in any way to edit your wallet balance in the node you are running, miners will confirm that the blockchain is invalid because it does not match with other distributed (decentralized) nodes in the network.
And transactions can happen outside the nodes but will be confirmed there. That is why if you receive BTC in your coinbase account, it would need to be confirmed by the networks.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:40:08
Be prepared for downvotes from the lurkers. Actually, I don't really care as long as we can keep spreading this education to those that have been manipulated.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:53:01
Those Vatican guys are smart, they are probably investing hard in Crypto too. You would not believe that Vatican has an official reseller/distributor for Avalon ASIC Miners. Check for yourself!
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:34:32
You are being naive. People, this community, would be the judge. There are a lot of legit alt coins out there. They have their own ideas and their promote them. I do not have any problem with that.
Crimes I mean here is by doing something unhealthily to harm Bitcoin and its users. There were a lots of things cancerous happened in the last few days.
They want bigger blocks? Just USE their own shitcoin then! Just abandon Bitcoin completely, why the notion this will replace that, and so on, and they are using dirty tactics to do that. In a regulated market, they would surely go to jail for that.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:17:09
I am also currently looking for alternatives. I read that ebit bitcoin miner and avalon are also somewhat reliable. I found no luck tho because they are also out of stock.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:57:09
Did you not see a whale?
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:49:57
It seems like they do not invest too much (politely speaking) on design, customer support, customer protection, and after sales support. We shall see how this goes.

Definitely not vice versa, I am a neutral here. So I also try to absorb as much information as possible just like you mentioned.
In r/btc, it almost like, the posts would not be legit until they say something bad about Bitcoin.
I am considering to unsubscribe that sub.

Do your part. Don't get manipulated, ignore them, and educate people. I actually have no problem with their existence, as in another alt coin. But, I just fed up with all that propaganda of the flippening, this will replace that, etc. Not mentioning all of their dirty tactics. Just simply a disgrace.

@_date: 2017-11-17 17:12:26
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:53:50
OK, keep using the alternatives that you see fit. And still, there is no acceptable excuse for using dirty tactics, right?
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:20:24
Because you cannot have: warming up your home + making hot water + making money (working ASIC miners) at the same time. Most of these ASIC miners have a working temp of 40 deg C to give optimum results. That would be definitely not enough for warming up cold water.

Are the fans still installed? I have seen a bunch of D3s in a liquid immersion facility without the fans installed. They said the fans draw pretty decent amount of power so it saves them much of the electricity bill. They have to somehow tricked the system tho so the miners would run with the fans rpm being faked-on.
