Much better.

This looks promising. Props to you.

Most of these "services" like bitlaunder are complete scams. 
You would be hard pressed to find one that isn't. 
If you want to anonymize your bitcoins and make it so it doesn't trace back to you then your best bet would be to find another user or a friend. Send them your bitcoins then have them send you bitcoins from a different account that isn't linked to the first one so there wouldn't be anyway it traced back to you.
 I'm positive this is legal in Singapore and everywhere and ontop of that you would have much less of a risk of being ripped off and much lower vendor fees. 
I'm sure some people on here would be willing to help. I know I wouldn't have a problem anonymizing your bitcoins for you if you PM me with the details.

It's a secret

Who are those two people that own like 1/4 of the bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-06-27 11:55:42
I'm pretty skilled in video editing if ioillusion wants to send me a list I can do that for sure.

Just visiting the site it was obviously a scam. 


These people have no one to blame but themselves

Most places require verification and all this stuff and week waits and IDs. If localbit seems to sketchy for you then you could always try trading with someone on here. The community here is pretty friendly and if there are any scammers the mods take care of them pretty quick. I could even help if you hit me up with a PM.

If you want to buy bitcoins without a service like that I'm sure several people on here would sell you bitcoins at lower rates then the prices you see with circle and coinbase. I know I could send you some if you were interested just PM me.

If Trump wins this post needs to be stickied. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:12:34
If he bans Western Union transactions out of the country and start making ridiculous taxes on national transactions like he says he wants to Bitcoin is going to start being used by millions of immigrants in the U.S to get money to their families at that point all we can do it hope Trump wouldn't try and ban bitcoin next.

The lack of self awareness if off the charts here.
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:09:51
Always there.

Honestly if you are just getting started a good place to get bitcoins from might actually be from someone else. I used to use paxful and localbit since when you are dealing with a real person you don't have the risk of automated bots flagging your account demanding ID or limiting spending. Customer support takes weeks when that happens and it can halt your bitcoin income with coinbase and even though you don't have to face vendor fees it's still more cons then pros.
If you are just looking to get $2000 on hand I'm sure some people on here would be willing to trade with you directly instead of having to wait a few days for confirmations and all that with the exchanges. Try asking around if you don't have any friends involved in bitcoins or even just send me a PM, I'd be willing to help.

I read this exact same argument about [Fight for the Future]( 


 


The same thing for OpenSecrets.org too.


 
You understand actively fighting for public legislation that hurts average citizens privacy or financial well being is more then a matter of personal opinion?
If these politicians don't want to get put on a list of people who are proposing laws to regulate financial freedoms. Then maybe they shouldn't be proposing laws to regulate financial freedoms?
It doesn't matter if these people want to ban bitcoins or legalize child porn. The principle is the same that the voters of their districts have a right to know what their stances on issues are and if they want them to be the person to represent them as their legislators.  And if the voters don't like their stance on a certain issue like bitcoins they don't just have a right but a responsibility to let their elected leader know that he or she isn't fighting for what the people want.

Finally getting the recognition we deserve. Nice work everyone. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 20:41:35
That would make sense. Know any other alternatives then that are still somewhat close to what I need?
