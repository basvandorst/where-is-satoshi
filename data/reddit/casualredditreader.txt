So, you store your transaction data on the Bitcoin blockchain but, you don't support Bitcoin as a payment option? How does this help the Bitcoin community?

last time it was down for about 1 hr. then came back with no problems. we have to start asking questions:
1. Who stands to benefit the most from this? 
2. What happens in the blockchain during these DDOS events?
3. What happens on other exchanges?
4. How shitty is Cloudflare if they can't stop a DDOS?
5. Who has enough hardware to take down Cloudflare?

Nope. I don't work for any exchange. 
I've just been a customer at BTC-e since 2012. Never had a problem. I'm not pushing any agendas.... or trying to save people from themselves. I prefer a totally free market with no rules or regulation. If someone wants to set up an anonymous exchange, and other people want to use it, then so be it. Let the market decide.

To tell you the truth, the company I trust the LEAST is an American company. If the US Gov't suddenly decides Bitcoin is illegal.... BOOM! There goes your entire balance. Assets frozen. Done. At least on a Russian/Bulgarian exchange I know that I'm beyond the reach of the US Gov't and their asinine financial decisions. We're all big boys and girls. We can manage our own money without someone acting like a nanny and telling us how to operate. I'm fully aware of the risk and I choose to stay with BTC-e.
So, how about some full disclosure? Who DO YOU WORK FOR? I've seen you posting in the trollbox before. You also seem to push other exchanges. So, it seems to me that you have a financial motivation to drive business away from BTC-e. But, I can't figure out why. Are you working with or promoting mcxNOW?
**EDIT:** Some other guy had an excellent point about crypto -- we don't even know who "Satoshi" is. ;)

Everyone loves to sit around and smoke hopium and dream about how BTC will be worth millions and billions. Meanwhile, the majority of people think it's worth about  $380. Don't put the cart before the horse. Someday it will be worth more. But, it's a bit soon to be crying "moon" and making grandiose announcements like: "no stopping it now". Price going up indicates that more people are interested in BTC and want to buy some.

Like I said before: if you don't like BTC-e, then don't use it. Vote with your wallet and go somewhere else. But, starting a smear campaign on Reddit (against an exchange that you don't even use) makes it seem like you have an ulterior motive.

They are limiting their exposure to arbitrage from Gox to prevent tanking their market.

The implementation is important too. I've seen a lot of good ideas that had shitty software which drove customers away. Later, another company came along and did the same thing (with better software / marketing) and they won. Never underestimate the importance of  the basics.

 1. It wouldn't address the problem, because it's a human problem involving lies and deception. The blockchain would say "funding is going towards testing". But, once the person in charge converts crypto to some other fungible asset... it would get reallocated toward something else. (e.g., "employment").
 2. But, the authority implementing this (i.e., the government) wouldn't stop at charities and non-profits. This would become a requirement for all businesses and private individuals. What started as a noble goal would devolve into an Orwellian nightmare.

A noble idea in theory. But, people have creative ways to cook the books. Just because something is labeled "testing" or "employment" doesn't mean that's where the money is going. Companies do this all the time: use expenses from one department to fund another. 
This may also apply to you and your personal finances for tax purposes in the future. You claim that 4% of your income went to childcare? Let's just pull up the blockchain and verify those purchases. How would it feel living under a microscope and having all transactions logged? Could this be use to retroactively target you if you upset the wrong people?

Not only is it a NSA creation, it's the trojan horse for one-world currency. Bitcoin is a pre-test. 
After the collapse of the dollar (and other debt-based fiat currencies) the NWO will roll out a new crypto coin controlled by the elites. It will be "BankerCoin" and will be 100% premined and centrally-controlled. 
Governments will ban all other crypto and claim it is used for terrorism (making it worthless). The new crypto will be used to track every aspect of your life in the police state.

Of course, all of this is predicated on a free and open Internet. If the President should happen to hit the [kill switch]( to prevent us from getting online it would stop all P2P activity. Imagine there's an economic collapse. Do you think the people would have time to switch to crypto currency?

Mine has been over a week. I purchased last Thursday. It was supposed to be available @ 7pm on Tuesday (3/19). Late Tuesday night the status changed from Pending to Complete. Then, it changed back to "Pending" and has been that way ever since. The support guys keep saying: "Wait 4 hours" or "Wait 2 more hours" and it's been 2 days since they started telling me that. Still no BTC. I'm beginning to think that Coinbase is a scam.

Coinbase has ALWAYS had problems. I fell sucker to their nice interface and (seemingly) simple method of purchasing Bitcoin. I was so disappointed and upset with them I took my money and went elsewhere. That was back in March. I will never use Coinbase again. You will have nothing but problems with that company.

And you think that PayPal, WesternUnion, MoneyGram, etc. are going to sit around and watch as their livelihood disappears because of BTC? Not likely. A more likely outcome is that they use their vast corporate funding to [BUY UP LARGE AMOUNTS OF BTC]( Then, they flood the market with it and cause a crash panic. People lose tons of money and get scared off from purchasing BTC again.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:51:03
I use Bitstamp.net now. It works for me because I no longer do bank transfers. I found that was the slowest part of Coinbase. It took 4-5 days to get money into my account. Now, I go to Bitstamp.net and log in. I click Deposit and select BitInstant. I go to my local grocery store and bring cash. I pay using Moneygram/ZipZap. They send the money to BitInstant who sends the money to Bitstamp. All in all it takes about 2 hours to fund my account. I have some friends of mine who still want to do bank transfers. For them, I recommend Bitfloor.com.

Sorry, I wasn't directing it to you personally. I just see a lot of people who want to try to pass a bunch of rules or regulations on the exchanges to protect people from themselves. I like the wild and free market just the way it is. If you don't have money to play with, you shouldn't be gambling.

There was no announcement. They switched out the entire backend and the database without telling anyone. They lost a bunch of BTC and left everyone hanging. There are TONS of people who are still waiting for their account to update. I've been waiting for more than a week now. 
Get your money out (if you can) and run away. Tell everyone you know to avoid this company like the plague. Try [bitstamp.net]( ) instead. Coinbase is incompetent. They've been telling everyone "check in 4 hours" for two days now.
@_date: 2013-04-20 10:22:55
Let me tell you my Coinbase story:
I purchased a few coins on a Thursday evening when the price was about $65. The status switched to "Pending" and stayed like that for 5 days. My BTC was supposed to arrive on Tuesday at 7:00 pm. On Monday they withdrew the money from my bank account. Then, on Tuesday, the time came and went and still no Bitcoin. Three hours later (at 10pm) my Bitcoin finally appeared. I attempted to send my coins to a local wallet. Nothing happened. The coins all disappeared and my status changed back to "Pending". No bitcoins in my local wallet and no bitcoins in my Coinbase wallet.
Then, all hell broke loose. The Coinbase site went down. The database became totally corrupted (they admitted later that they had to re-write massive sections of their code on the fly). So, 2 days go by with no word from Support. Nothing on their Twitter. Nothing on their web site. Nothing on Reddit. No email. Nothing. Just silence. I finally got a support response 2 days later that said: "It should be fixed, try it in an hour". I waited. It wasn't fixed. 10 more hours went by. Nothing was fixed. I opened another support ticket. Silence. 8 more hours go by and I get another "It should be fixed now. Try again in an hour" response. Nope. Finally, late on Friday (a week and a day after I purchased the Bitcoin) it appeared in my wallet. I was then able to send them to a local wallet. At that point I asked to have my account closed and have been warning all my friends and family to avoid Coinbase.
Other people have described problems where they have extra coins show up in their wallet. Other people wait 5 days and then get the "Cancelled due to high risk" message. During the time all my funds were locked up in Coinbase the price of BTC went up to like $150. There were so many opportunities for trading and making money during the week I probably lost thousands of dollars. 
There is a whole group of new Coinbase apologists popping up on Reddit to tell you that they are a great company. They will probably downvote me for posting about my negative experience. I had a terrible experience with Coinbase. Their customer service was so awful that I'd rather do business with PayPal (and I loathe PayPal). If you are considering signing up to a service try Bitstamp instead. I switched and I couldn't be happier.

That's what I did. I had 6 BTC sitting on their site and I transferred it to my local wallet. Unfortunately, I still have 1 BTC transaction still pending and am starting to get worried. But, I got 5 BTC out a few days ago.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:39:33
Don't buy anything from Coinbase! 
I purchased 5 bitcoins from them in the past with no problems. But, starting last week they began having problems. They pulled down their entire backend and replaced the database 2 days ago. Things are still messed up. 
I put in an order to buy 1 BTC a  week ago from Coinbase. Here it is over a week later and my account still says "Pending". Every time I talk to support they tell me: "It should be fixed, check in 4 hours" but nothing changes. The withdrawal from my bank went though on Monday. Here we are 5 days later and I still don't have any bitcoin. 
If I ever get that bitcoin back I'm closing my account with Coinbase and switching over to  instead.  Be careful sticking your money in Coinbase. You might not get it back.

Yeah, I got mine too. Then, I got them out as quickly as possible and left Coinbase. I set up an account on [Bitstamp.net.]( I've already got it funded (less than 1 day with [Bitinstant.com]( and I'm making money. Goodbye Coinbase. Anyone in the future reading this stay away from Coinbase.

It's looking more and more like Coinbase is a scam. I've been waiting for a week for my BTC and my account still says "Pending". I do live in California. I purchased it last Thursday and here we are a week and a day later with NO bitcoin! Stay away from this company!!!

I have a question:
If someone mines (or buys) say... 100 BTC... and then their computer melts and they lose their wallet.dat and have no backups --- do those coins still exist in the blockchain forever?
How much "missing" BTC do you think is in the blockchain right now?

Thanks for the input. A lot of the people are asking for really small amounts. I saw one guy asking for like $20 and another wanted $6 for the bus. I know that is pretty high profile and tends to get front page attention. 
I wouldn't be willing to loan someone $2,000. But, if there were a crowd-funding BTC site I'd chip in $5 or $10 to some worthy cause. 
Imagine if a bunch of people raised like $10k to help some kid with cancer. That would probably make it to the mainstream media. (Especially if it were all in BTC). Charity work could help "prove" that BTC is real money.

Great job ninja256! (And, of course, Sean's Outpost for doing all the hard work and posting pics). I donated 1 BTC to the cause yesterday. I really think that [charitable causes](  could bring a lot of positive attention to Bitcoin. It's a win-win for everyone and, it makes you feel good. I could spend the money on myself and buy more shit that I don't need. But, feeding hungry people or helping others who are less fortunate is much more rewarding.

Hahahahahahahaha. You think they WANT to kill off the drug trade?!!?!? The drug trade is perfect for two reasons:
1. It allows the feds to militarize the local police. You can't give a small town cop a tank or machine guns for no reason. But, the "war on drugs" is a perfect opportunity and excuse.
2. It provides VAST pools of funding for "black ops" and other off-budget activities. If you have a large, underground, unregulated, unaccounted for industry that produces trillions of dollars a year it's the perfect way to make money and keep it off the books.
You can sit around and dream all you want. Come up with Libertarian/Anarchist/Utopian fantasies all day long. But, I'm telling you, that in the end, the people in control (who have the money) will take over your little fantasy and crash it and use it for themselves. You are not going to displace the very big, very rich people who run the system. It won't happen. Sorry.
What makes you think the rich people in charge don't WANT a revolution? A revolution would allow them to consolidate power. It would also be the perfect opportunity to use [these]( and [these]( Wake up! The system is rigged... and you are not in control. Everyone is being played like pawns on a chessboard.

Interestingly enough, after a week the status changed from "Processing" to "Completed". Then, I attempted to empty my account and send to my local wallet. Now **THAT** says "Pending". Every other site on the Internet can handle BTC transactions within 45 minutes. But, it takes Coinbase a week.
@_date: 2013-03-24 15:30:24
No. You put in an order @ 10. They start a transfer from your bank and lock up the funds while the transfer happens. During this 5 days bitcoin could double in price. If you had access to the funds you could buy bitcoins quickly and make money as they go up in value. You might even make enough to buy another bitcoin.  But, since Coinbase has locked up your funds for 5 days you have to wait.

The main problem you would have is defense. How do you prevent nations with F-18 fighter jets or Apache attack helicopters from declaring war on your nation? You might be able to defend yourself against sea pirates but, not against aggressive nations who have a large military. As much as everyone would like to have a peaceful utopia where we all live together in harmony with no weapons -- it won't work as long as one guy has weapons and is hellbent on using them.

A lot of people don't like Bitcoin because they see early adopters holding big bags of coins. They think it's a rigged game. You're holding a fortune in BTC that you got for $10 and asking them to buy in at $200+ They think it's a ponzi scheme that you're trying to con them into.

They screwed me too. I've been waiting for over a week for BTC from them. It showed up (briefly) in my account on Tuesday (3/19). Then, they took it away and changed the status to "Pending".

I purchased 1 BTC last Thursday (3/14). It was due to be delivered on Tuesday (3/19) at 7:00 pm. Around 10 pm that night it finally changed from "Pending" to "Completed". Then, at 1:20 am on 3/20 they changed the status back to "Pending" and I haven't seen it since. **I've been waiting for over a week now for 1 BTC!** They keep saying: "We fixed it. Just wait for 4 hours." for about 2 days now. I'm beginning to suspect they are a scam.
The best explanation I've seen about this so far is this:


@_date: 2013-02-14 23:50:59
I would like a market watch / autobuy app. 
I've seen similar things on sites where you can purchase gold/silver. You set a "target price" and then you can do one of 2 things:
 * If it reaches the target it could alert you (sms or email)
 * If it's linked with your bank account it could initiate an auto purchase (with your pre-approved permission)
This would save me time having to constantly monitor the market. I tell it how many bitcoins I want to purchase, set a price, and if the market goes to that price -- the app handles the transaction for me.

The issue is with communication. They need someone (preferably the CEO) out front telling everyone what's going on, and when it might be fixed, and what they're doing to fix it, and any problems they're encountering, etc. Right now we're all in the dark and our money is in limbo.

Just a followup to let everyone know how it went -- drove to my local grocery store, paid cash (you have to bring cash!), they processed my order for about $4 and gave me a receipt. By the time I got home my Bitstamp.net account was funded. Soooo much faster and easier than Coinbase. (Bank transfers there were taking 4-5 days and that's when their servers are **not** melting down or crashing)
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:56:23
Yes, and the prices are going up (slowly) as people are buying. When Gox opens it's going to go even higher. My point is that the way the Bitcoin market looked 2 years ago is not even comparable to today. Bitcoin has a much bigger audience now.

And, I'm saying that as soon as BTC threatens the central banks (in a serious way) then they will use all their resources to kill it. They are professional thieves and they aren't going to let some other entity muscle in on their turf. Right now BTC is fun for crypto-nerds, anarchists, and libertarians. The Fed is not worried about your relatives or your neighbors switching all their dollars to bitcoin en masse.

Last week their servers had serious problems. they ended up having to rewrite a bunch of code and fix the database. There were MASSIVE problems. Lots of people (myself included) couldn't get access to our bitcoins, or to the bank transfers we had started. Our money was in limbo for over a week and we couldn't cancel or reverse it.
That's bad enough. But, to add insult to injury the guys at Coinbase weren't telling anyone what was going on. They kept sending out obvious lies in Support tickets saying: "Check back in 4 hrs. it should be fixed now." This went on for 2 days. Either they ignored you, or they sent a cookie-cutter copy/paste response which didn't help. In the end all  they said was: Sorry we screwed up. Yeah you did.... with MY money!!! Another problem that they are having is that they don't actually have any bitcoins to sell you. Many people are getting error messages when they try to buy bitcoins. Either that or they have them taken away later as they are deemed "high risk". 
They do a long (4-5 days) bank transfer and THEN they buy your bitcoin. This can be very painful if you're watching the price of bitcoin go up, up, up. If you had access to your funds you could at least go somewhere else. But, you can't. Your funds are locked. If you are buying 1 or 2 bitcoins it might be OK. But, if you're buying 4 or more -- avoid Coinbase. There are better services out there. Try some of them out.

I believe that might have been true the first time around because there was a finite number of nerds interested in cryptocurrency. But, a VAST new pool of people has come into the market. (And still are coming in...) I had friends of mine who knew nothing about crypto asking me about BTC. I think that the number of new people coming in is going to outweigh the people selling and going out. I think we'll see it start to go up again as the size of the pool of interested people continues to grow.

I purchased 1 BTC  last Thursday (3/14). They said it would complete at 7:00pm on Tuesday (3/19). It finally did complete a few hours after 7 pm. Then, I sent it to my local wallet. That transaction never completed.
Today I saw my Coinbase account updated. They cancelled the transfer to my local wallet (doesn't even appear in the list). Then, they changed my "purchased bitcoin" status to "Pending". (It used to be "Completed")
My balance (which was 0 but should have been 1) is now showing -1.00 and it looks like I owe Coinbase $72.01!

How did you like that BTC [crash]( today? Nope. It wasn't planned at all.
@_date: 2013-03-23 04:01:18
Full story is this:
Last Thursday (3/14) I purchased 1 BTC when it was @ $47.97
Transaction said it would complete on Tuesday (3/19) after 7:00 pm
That time came and went and it still said "Pending". Well, about 3 hours later (on Tuesday) it **finally** changed to status "Completed". I waited a few more hours then I sent the bitcoin to my local wallet. A new transaction appeared and said "Pending". This is normal. It usually takes about 1 hr to get 6 confirmations and then the transfer is complete.
But, my status never changed. My bitcoin never arrived at the local wallet. I waited and waited and then opened a support ticket. Then, I found out that other people were having problems too. I waited. And watched my email. Coinbase said they're working on it. Major backend meltdown. Total database reconfiguration. This goes on for 2 days. I log back into Coinbase and [my transaction to the local wallet is gone]( My balance is negative. My purchase (which was complete now says pending). I open another support ticket to let them know.
Finally, on Thursday (3/21) they say: "We think it's fixed. Give it a few hours to catch up and you should be fine."  I wait. My balance is back to 1.00 but says "Pending". Then, I open another support ticket and send them tweets. They say: "Just wait another 4 hours and it will go through." This morning at 10:30 am they updated their support FAQ and said: "Wait 4 more hours starting from now." Well, we're going on 11 hours later. Still nothing. No comment from Coinbase. Just: wait some more and it will be fixed. But, my BTC which DID arrive on Tuesday is still "Pending" and I can't get it out of Coinbase.
From the time I issued the transaction until now it's been a WEEK! They took the money out of my account on Monday (3/18). But, I still have no bitcoin. The best explanation that I've seen for this is from [this guy]( They are probably speculating and got caught off guard by the rapid rise in BTC price. But, that's not my problem. My problem is that they owe me 1 BTC. 
As soon as I get it, I'm going to get the hell out of Coinbase for good. I've got verifications going at a few other exchanges right now. I think that Coinbase is going to have a lot more problems like this in the future. My advice to anyone thinking about using Coinbase: avoid them! "[They fuck you in the drive-thru](
*Update (3/23): Last night they finally came through and changed the status of my order! I purchased at $47 and BTC went up to $72 during the week. I could have been investing, trading, buying, doing a whole lot with that money. Instead it was locked in the Coinbase system. I've withdrawn all my BTC from their server and asked them to close my account. Save yourself the headache. Don't put money in Coinbase.*

I sent them some scathing emails and tweets too. They deserved it. I see a lot of people saying: "But, they're beta!" Yeah? Well, guess what? They aren't some free image-hosting or webmail service. They are dipping into MY bank account and taking MY money. I like MY money and I'm **very** concerned about where it is. Grabbing someone's money for 7 days without warning is like reaching over and grabbing some other dude's dick at the urinal. You just don't do it. And, if you do, you should expect to get punched in the head. You don't fuck with other people's money and then shrug it off as a beta problem. Unacceptable.
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:11:01
Not only that -- but, if you did buy BTC on Coinbase last week chances are you still can't get to it. I submitted a purchase order back when BTC was at $47. That was over a week ago. My account still says "Pending". They charged my bank and took the money. But, I still don't have any bitcoin. Coinbase is looking more and more like a scam. If I had it to do over again, I would avoid Coinbase. They've been very unprofessional during this whole outage. I'm going to switch over to  instead. I'm also awaiting verification on Mt. Gox.

I won't use it. They pre-created 100 billion coins. They give 80 billion away and keep 20 billion for themselves. How exactly are they going to give them away? Friends? Family? It can't be done fairly. Someone will be at the top of that Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:20:02
They lock your funds up, then the price of BTC goes up. You get screwed and there's nothing you can do about it.

Did you read the newspaper article they linked to? 


@_date: 2013-03-22 01:07:12
Thanks. I updated my link.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:27:14


Yeah, because who --on a site named **LOCAL**bitcoins-- would expect you to have to actually go meet someone near you in person? That's just crazy.
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:21:30
Has anyone been able to predict BTC price using these methods? (if so... proof?)
I see a lot of people applying graphing and charting techniques from the stock market to bitcoin. Some of this seems like modern-day phrenology to me.

Thanks Fred. Too little too late. But, at least you finally started telling customers what is going on with their money. [Playing with my money is like playing with my emotions](

Everyone loves the "free market" as long as they are making money. As soon as it goes south everyone wants to implement rules and regulations. People forget that the Internet is the REAL WORLD. If you walked by some random stranger at the bus station and he told you to invest in some stock you'd write him off as a nutjob and ignore him. Why would you put any trust in some stranger on the Internet? I'm sorry, but I don't feel bad for people who are too stupid to think for themselves. A fool and his money are soon parted.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:13:25
I call "bullshit"
You've been saying "4 more hours" for 2 days now.
I still don't have access to my BTC that I purchase OVER A WEEK AGO!

One advantage of running your own node is that you are in control. If we've learned anything about cloud services it's that they have problems just like anyone else. I remember a few years back when Gmail went down for awhile and people were losing their minds. If you can afford to be without your data / bitcoins / email when the service is down, and you trust them to manage it for you, then go with the cloud service. I personally like having encrypted backups that I can hold in my hand that I can get to whenever I want.

The whole "we-have-to-protect-people-from-themselves" attitude on kills me. These are adults who are spending their money freely. Let them do what they want. People buy lottery tickets. People gamble in Vegas even though they know the house has better odds. I think speculation is good for the market and I hope more people get into it. Some win, some lose. But, the overall market grows as more people play the game.
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:57:23
And get out of Coinbase. [They fuck you in the drive thru]( There are better companies out there. Check out Bitstamp.net and fund it with Bitinstant.com. You could have bitcoins in your account within 2 hours. (Not 5 days later with a server meltdown in-between)
@_date: 2013-04-22 10:35:08
It's back up. They were just working on their server.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:17:10
[This]( helps to explain what's going on. Pure bitcoin exchanges take 10 min - 1 hour to get multiple confirmations. Your bank, on the other hand, takes a few days to do a funds transfers.
@_date: 2013-05-17 09:52:56
You bring up a good point. One we haven't really read about yet with Bitcoin. You hear about Craigslist robberies all the time. Some guy shows up with $500 cash expecting to buy an iPhone and gets mugged. If Bitcoin continues to grow in popularity more people will be exposed to this kind of risk. Always, always use common sense and meet in the daytime in a high-traffic location (ie: a store or coffee shop). I would also avoid having people come to my house. Go out and meet them somewhere.

Ahhhh so young, naive, and dreamy. Guess what? The central banks aren't going to let you take them out. They will declare war on Bitcoin long before that happens and eliminate the competition. How you might ask? 
1. [Buy vast amounts of BTC]( and use it to flood the market and create a panic crash.
2. Declare it to be illegal and demonize it via the mainstream media. "Terrorists.... drugs.... blah... blah... blah.. North Korea using Bitcoin...." Bam. No more credibility for BTC. No more converting to/from fiat currency.
3. Worst case scenario? [Internet kill switch]( Good luck getting to your BTC when you don't have Internet.

Much better! Thank you. Excellent work on this.

They have been saying "It should be fixed. Just wait 4 hours" for like two days now. I've had some BTC stuck in there since last week. Still says "Pending". It's beginning to smell more and more like a scam.

Here's why I don't use Coinbase:
@_date: 2013-03-21 04:10:21
Here's my opinion on Bitcoin (and it probably won't be very popular here). Don't get me wrong, I like BTC and I own some. I use it and I've bought stuff with it. It's a fascinating experiment.
BTC is a libertarian / anarchist's dream come true: a currency that isn't owned or controlled by any central government. It's been going up because of speculators. I keep asking the question: "What do you spend Bitcoins on?" and most people don't. They aren't spending BTC, they're hoarding them in hopes that it will go up and they will get rich. There will be some Bitcoin millionaires. Those are the early adopters who got in and speculated early. But, if nobody is spending then it's not really money. It's just a commodity being used to gamble.
But, the US Government, the Federal Reserve, the European Central bank, basically, ALL central banks will not permit Bitcoin to disrupt their scam. Think about it -- these are the guys who assassinated 2 US Presidents to prevent being eliminated. All central banks in the world are controlled by one mega, mega, mega rich family: the Rothschilds. Guess which countries aren't under their control? Iran. North Korea. Cuba. -- our gov't refers to them as "the axis of evil". (Do you see a pattern?)
My guess is that if BTC gets big enough to threaten them, they'll create a crisis of confidence in the Bitcoin market. They will do everything in their power to convince people that only pirates, drug dealers, and terrorists use Bitcoin. They will create their own version of a cryptocurrency (that they control) and offer it as an alternative to Bitcoin. Then, they will attack, arrest, jail and demonize anyone who is using BTC and essentially force the entire economy underground.
The central banks of the world have been around for 300+ years and they have gotten extremely good at manipulating the global economy. They are ruthless and have vast resources at their disposal. Before Bitcoin has a chance to go mainstream they will kill it though laws, regulation, taxes, hacking, misinformation, and propaganda. Go ahead and save this post. Then, check back in 5 years and see if it came true.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:54:42
Same problem. Only magnified to a global scale. You can't be stupid and expect other people to think or make decisions for you. Everyone wants to put the blame on someone/something else. Look in the mirror. Take responsibility.
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:41:37
Cool. It's a worthy cause. I donated too. I think the devs need to add some "Soup Nazi" error messages to the Bitcointip bot. It would certainly liven things up.
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:03:17
Yeah. And you honestly believe it's your God-given right to always have Internet? They would never [take that away]( from us. If the world fell apart at least you'd still be able to post on Reddit.... right? Right? Open your eyes! The world is not as it seems. The criminals in charge don't like competition.

If this is to be believed, someone hacked the Coinbase DB:
@_date: 2013-03-24 03:34:58
The problem is that time is money. If I had 10 BTC in my account I could trade it, invest, do all sorts of stuff. I can't go for 4-5 days without access  to my funds. From the time I purchased till the time I got out of Coinbase the price almost doubled. I couldn't do ANYTHING because my funds were in limbo. I know that they are new but, I have decided that I'm not going to use them anymore. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:18:04

Yep as soon as mine becomes available I'm cashing out. Think I might switch to Bitstamp, Bitfloor or BTC-e. I don't trust Coinbase anymore. This whole debacle was handled poorly.

Someday we may need mBTC. But, today, it's not necessary. So, just stop.
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:55:33
Dude... I've emailed them like 10 times.... bugged the shit out of them on twitter.... contacted their CEO directly..... they know who I am by now. I'm just tired of getting vague emails that say: "Wait for another 4 hours and it should be fixed". They've been telling me that for 2 days. I get the fact that they are small and that they need help. But, their service takes people's MONEY. Anytime that money is involved it gets to be serious business real fast. I'm lucky I guess. I'm only out 1 BTC so far (I was able to transfer 5 BTC out before this problem started). I feel bad for the guys who are waiting on like 25 BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-14 06:38:26
Yeah, I remember that. I switched to Bitstamp instead and have been very happy with them.
@_date: 2013-06-16 09:59:33
To answer your question: Yes. I think it's low. I think it should be between $130 and $140.
I know it's not a get rich quick scheme but, it was $130 two weeks ago. There is no logical reason for it to drop in that short of a time. I want to hear reasons from why they think it suddenly shifted. The ups and downs are still too extreme (or it's being manipulated).
@_date: 2013-02-21 07:25:31
If their [web site]( contains inaccurate information, then someone should update it. 
It doesn't really matter to me anyway. I don't plan on using Ripple. It sounds like a nice Ponzi scheme for the guy who set it up. He gets a massive chunk of credits and then pretends to hand them out fairly. (I'm sure that his buddies and their friends make a fortune). Tell him to give me a million credits and I'll sign up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:45:30
You're comparing recent crash to previous crashes. The thing that has changed since then is public exposure. Back when it was $10 nobody had heard about it but nerds and crypto junkies. Now, it's being covered by Bloomberg, and mainstream magazines and newspapers. I think that the recovery will be much quicker than you predict. Price will stabilize around $60 and start going back up from there. We'll be back at $200 within a month and $300 by the end of May. There were a lot of people wanting to buy in when it was under $100 but, missed the chance. Those people are going to drive the price back up to like $125 very quickly.
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:40:58
Very informative. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:22:05
Yeah, it's still not working. My account has said "Pending" since last week. Still no BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:35:36
I think it's slightly cheaper for transfers and I like the interface. Plus you don't have to send them your entire life story (utility bill, ID, etc.) or get verified to use the service. Mt. Gox is moving to San Francisco. How long before they are reporting your financial data to the IRS?
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:14:21
Coinbase fucked me over multiple times. I eventually took all my money and went elsewhere. 
I will never use their service again. I wanted to like them so much, but they are an awful company.
@_date: 2013-03-24 08:37:55
I signed up for bitstamp.net and fund my account with bitinstant.com. It takes like 1-2 hours to get funds in your account. (As opposed to 5 days) IMHO, linking your checking account to Coinbase is the major problem. I drove to my bank, took cash out of the ATM and used it to pay bitinstant.com. It took 20 minutes. Super easy.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:51:25
I have not tried cash deposits with Bitfloor. The 1-4 % fee doesn't sound too bad and 30 minutes is great. I'll try it out sometime.
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:23:10
I got screwed over by Coinbase enough. I took my money and left. I won't do business with them again.
