Remember that every short Futures Position has an opposing Long Position...so there is exactly the same money betting in falling BTC prices and also in rising BTC prices... Just mention this because the tenor of many posts was that futures always bring the BTC down...

But what about a seed consisting of some words? Let the Supercomputer try all combinations of existing english words... Or are there Wallets having a mechanism that after three tries you have to wait until the next try?
