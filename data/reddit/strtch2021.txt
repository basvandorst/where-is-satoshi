I thought about it but the returns would diminish over time, think about it like this: If you have 10k and price goes up 50% you have 5k profit minus fees. If you had only 7k in btc because you've being selling profit and btc goes 50% up you've only made 3.5k minus fees. The bigger the bulk the bigger is the profit.

I would like to know why this type of comments always get downvoted. Im pretty bullish for BTC and I think we have great chances of reaching 40k before May, but if someone asks I think it's important to clarify that things could always go the other way, we are talking Bitcoin right here, high volatility it's part of his nature, and we know it's prompt to feedback from day one.

Hi, I actually invested in BTC because of Uranus entering in Taurus (not joking).  Uranus is the planet of chaos, technology, rebellion, and unexpected change. Taurus, on the other hand, is the symbol of  finances, values, possessions, and sensual pleasures. This is interpreted by many astrologers as an intense financial  revolution for the next 8 years driven by an unexpected or new technology , and I think that technology is Bitcoin

This is obvious, specially if you take into account that this government devalued our currency by 800% in just 4 years. They obviously don't want the best for the population, and I don't even think it has to do with being "left" or "right" wing (this government was suposed to be liberal and right wing) , but with a colonialistic mindset of "fuck those poor bastards and lets take out  resources from this shithole"

Una vez que se acredita le das a comprar Bitcoins (BTC) y listo. Es una pavada.

I do have a Paypal account, I can't have an USD balance as far as I know because I can only deposit ARs in it, and if I buy something in USD the bank or paypal makes the exchange.  
 I can however have an USD account in the bank; I cannot pay for everyday things in USD, and from every conversion from AR to USD and backwards I pay around 5% fee. Also maintaining an USD account in the bank costs around 5% minimum wage monthly.   
USD is only used as a store of value.

This is true, at least for me... Im in my mid twenties and this is my first time investing. After this experience I think Im "spoiled", 70% gain in less than three months... makes 10% a year sound stupid; and would never invest in something with so "little" returns. At least that's how I feel and I believe many will feel the same after investing in BTC

What if it happens in November
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:08:08
Not Venezuelan; but my country (Argentina) had a devaluation of  72 % in three years ( 1AR = 13U$s in 2016, 1AR = 46U$s in 2019).   
Personally I would  obviously choose BTC, partly  in  the hopes of regaining some of that loss; but I can totally see uneducated and marginalised people using Libra because of facebook popularity and  ease of use.  We are talking of about 40% of the population aproximately.  
 That   people can not think of investments because they are very busy surviving, and having no savings means that they can not afford to see BTC dropping 50%, even if it rises 1000% in 3 years.

That's great! I didn't knew that website. It seems awesome, but I was thinking more of a "step by step" instruction. Maybe it is redundant, but for fools like me it took a long time to jump in to BTC because of the lack of a step by step tutorial that takes in to consideration the local bureaucracy and particularities. 
To give an example, the official distributor of Trezor in Argentina (as stated on Trezor's official website) is a guy that you meet at a Starbucks.
 I suppose maybe there are also particularities for other countries that you only understand once you gathered courage and faced the "unknown", and that it could be nice and potentially useful if people who already did it explained it here.

@_date: 2019-06-11 17:18:10
Hey Anon516, Im really interested in the concept of a blockchain based economy, I do think it has future as a project and I support it both ideologically and with my money owning the little of bitcoin I can afford at the time. Im prepared for the worst in the next months or even years because I know even if it drops sooner or later BTC it's going to re-gain value, so for me it's definitely not just about the price.  But besides that I think many of us   are here for financial reasons also and we hope to see economic results because of our involvement with the technology, that is to make a few bucks along the way or at least escape the devaluation of our rotted currencies (I can't afford to see my savings in pesos worth nothing). So with that in mind I can't seem to wrap my mind about why it would be bad to have some savings in another coin that is gaining value.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:52:32
yeah but if you live in a third world country like me neocons fuck the currency twice as fast every time they take the government. Also local governments aren't the only ones that control our money, there are a lot of agents at play , so we need an alternative currency too. Politics in real life aren't so black and white like in theory

Yes they know, and I think that generation will be a hell of a LOT more comfortable with money that it's always there, on the internet accesible by you keys, no matter what happens, that you can send anywhere in the world without conversions and without intermediaries, just like in videogames, rather than controlled by a shady bureaucratic organization controlled by who knows who that makes you fill paperwork and can freeze your account if they don't like how you use your money.

@_date: 2019-06-16 23:19:52
Do you mean 2021?  
To be clear I've been buying the last couple of months around the 7k and 8k price; it's not like this would be my first 1k, but I guess that would be a good idea; buy a reasonable amount now, and then keep making smaller purchases here and there with the dips.  
I saw last year's big dip from around 6k to 3.5k;  but being this close to a halving and assuming that the halving will have a lot of repercussion in the end of 2019 I doubt we are going to see btc below 6.5k any time soon, but well, who knows

Sorry to explode your balloon, but the government in charge for the last 3 years and a half in Argentine who is responsible for this last  inflation and peso devaluation is a right wing one, it's not even close to socialism. And the government in charge during the 2001 crisis that OP described was a neoliberal right wing one too...

Yes, it's Argentina. The current government took $57.1 billion dollars in debt. The population didn't vote for this , nore had any kind of participation in this decision. We will have to repay this at least for the rest of my life, and the "strategy" to repay it is trough austerity measures: firing people, cutting resources for science, health and education. It seems that for  the IMF the way for progress is to have an uneducated, sick and unemployed population.... and It's funny because at the same time, mining and agriculture explotation pay less taxes than ever.This same institution encouraged  policies that led to the country’s worst economic crisis in 2001, which pushed millions into poverty.

I have a question about Bitcoin price and exchange times:
  
When I buy bitcoins through my local exchange, the transaction can last up to 6 hours from the moment I make the order on the website ([cryptomkt.com]( ) to the time where the BTC are effectively in my account. The exchange rate used to deposit this BTC in my account will be the exchange at the time of the order or the exchange rate at the time of receiving them?  
Lets say I order when BTC is at 8500usd , but I receive them when it's at 8700usd, wich one of these exchange rates is going to be used for the transaction?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:04:16
It's all because of the memes
@_date: 2019-05-21 06:38:26
In Argentina, around 18 years ago banks holded peoples money because of a situation like this (inflation was terrible and you couldn't take the money out of the bank, and what you had in dollars was returned in pesos who by that time worthed nothing), so the idea of "being your own bank" will be very seductive in a place like this. 
I can see a future where crypto grows here because of that: a better solution than having your life savings hidden under the mattress

yes, 6 hours is  a long time but it may have to do with the fact that I live in a shitty country and Im paying with shitty local money. 
 Given that the local money is also fluctuating a lot I was afraid that if for example I buy at 9am with my local money worthing  0.5 btc, at the time of the arrival 0.40 where deposited in my account because of bitcoin rise+local money devaluation
@_date: 2019-05-21 06:33:55
It's not popular but certainly many people are starting to consider it somehow, at least among the younger generations. Around 18 years ago banks holded peoples money because of a situation like this (inflation was terrible and you couldn't take it out, what you had in dollars was returned in pesos who by that time worthed nothing), so the idea of "being your own bank" is very seductive, at least for me.

As an Argentinian I have to say I find it pretty cruel to laugh about this, there's many people suffering from the inflation rate, including me.

I think people in the US has less chances of being ripped of by the state than third world countries. The state in here can take blatantly autoritharian shapes, 30 years ago we had a (US backed) dictatorship for example, so we feel like we can expect anything.
  Nonetheless it's smart to recognize you can't expect your government to keep racking up debt and printing money till infinit without consecuences. 
US government has now the war machine on their side and that guarantees the necessary hegemony to keep asking for money without consequences, but things may  change someday.
