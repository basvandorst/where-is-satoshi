You don't get anything, at this point you are framing him based on your own assumptions and ignoring his initial point just to talk about something that makes you feel like you are better then him.

I mean... Do you really need to ask me what I want to know? Because I said it 3 times by now, I just wanted to know who your dealer in China is.

He may be real, but he is behaving shady as heck. He posted claiming he is to share information and asked to ask him questions, then proceeded to ignore most of the important ones. Like I was wondering who his equipment dealer in China is, and is it in Shenzhen. I saw similar question but he did not answer, so I re asked him. He pretty much ignored my question and just said he found them on Alibaba... That was not helpful at all. And there is ton of cases like that where he just avoids questions. If he did not want to answer those fair and square, why the hell he would create his thread?  
I can imagine that he is real, but he acts in style as "I will appear like I am real, but do so in way that suggests I am fake".  
When someone goes "ask me questions" and then ignores your questions without even explaining why, but picking questions he likes, of course people going to be unhappy and very skeptical.

Thank you. This is exactly kind on answer people expect when they ask questions like that. I will check them out.

There is shitload of them on Alibaba, is there any reason you can't name your specific one?

I would like to ask same question, since you did not answer - which dealer you using?
