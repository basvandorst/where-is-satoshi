For discussions sake, could you have a voting type mechanism, almost like when the blockchain splits and miners need to agree on the right chain?
Yes, I see the who-watches-the-watchmen situation here. And should miners determine guilt. Maybe not :)
I dont know, was just thinking that in clear cut scenarios like an exchange being cleared out and thousands of people lose all they have - a way to hinder or semi-track perpetrators would maybe help deter or aid recovery of funds. People are wanting law enforcement to help recover their savings/investments - but on the other hand asking them to do so through at system implicitly designed to hinder them to help. Maybe these worlds are incompactible..
Didnt lose anything in the recent debacle, but feel for those that did.

Ok but.. How is a piece of paper with arbitrary txt on it and blackened out IDs on it proof just because of the ethnicity of the picture? Or did you see unedited versions of this?

Thank you for the serious reply btw!
Given that fungibility is essential (note that fiat currency can be blacklisted/market on serial numbers though?) - could a system where the network votes on a tag/confidence score of an output work in theory?
All currency would be equally valid, but at the discretion of merchants, wallet owners etc they could provide information to help track down criminals.
500 btc stolen from mtgox. The network votes and a 90% red-flag score is attached to that btc. Later, this is used to buy a car. The car dealership finishes the deal, delivers the car, but also notes that the btc is directly traceable to the theft. They alert the proper authorities etc. Pure madness?

Was asking if it was possible given the unique nature of cryptocurrency, not necessarily if it was a great idea.
