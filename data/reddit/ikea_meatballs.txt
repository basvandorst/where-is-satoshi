It's kind of pathetic that a private company like Dwolla can become way more attractive, marketable, usable, cheaper, and better than Bitcoin in such a short time.

How do I put money into mtgox?  Like, say, $5000 ?  I'm in the US.
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:13:21
They did videos about the 2008 crash... and the US debt situation.. I have a lot of US Dollars... how are those not assets?

they're funded by Union Square Ventures.. same company that funded twitter.

I decided to take your advice and transfer my coins out from Coinbase to multibit, but I'm afraid that I lost all my coins.  This is what I did:
1. Open up multibit
2. Hit the "request" tab
3. Put in a label ("Coinbase transfer") and copied the address.
4. Opened coinbase.
5. Went to send money in coinbase, and pasted in the address from  double checking to make sure it was the same.
6. Now my coins are gone from Coinbase, and I don't see any confirmed or unconfirmed transactions in multibit.  
I opened up the receiving address in blockchain.info:   and it says that there have been 4 confirmations already.  
Am I screwed?
@_date: 2013-03-17 18:32:20
You still have to trust blockchain.info, no?  They could get hacked..

it seems like these alternate currencies are THE thing to know about.  they seem very pump-n-dump'y; created, and pre-mined..but i don't know what i'm talking about!
it even seems there are NATIONAL / ETHNIC factions around new cryptocurrencies.. e.g., some are only popular in the russian community..

How about Roman processes my ACH transfer first.  Thanks.

Learning the definitions of words?  Really, punk?
"Gambling is the wagering of money or something of material value (referred to as "the stakes") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning additional money and/or material goods".
How is speculating not a subset of gambling?

thanks, very helpful.  do you think it's worth buying into each cryptocurrency currently on btc-e?  another question please :)  btc-e sells bitcoins for $137 us.  why not buy them, move them over to gox, and sell em on gox?

Where did you buy your coins?  I usually use coinbase but they've hit their rolling daily limit.

I emailed Jim from multibit.  Turns out my coins are safe.  There's a known bug with multibit ... I had to reset the block chain.  Whew.

it's a good start, but who uses a bank of america card?  to me it reinforces the fact that bitcoin is version 0.1 of the new digital currency... barking up the right tree but not ready for prime time.  and no guarantee of being converted to the real thing when it's ready
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:15:25
