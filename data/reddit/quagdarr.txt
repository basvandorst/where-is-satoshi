Lightning Network already took care of it. And it will only get better there are sites that show how many nodes are coming on and it is skyrocketing basically saying humans are putting nodes out there for the world to use as there is zero profit from hosting a node on the lightning network.
But it is already strengthening hey Herculean like network already where the fees are almost nonexistent and the settlement is instantaneous.

In today’s scenario I was thinking of Short Selling, why I am scared of BTC being a traceable futures contract. It allows big pockets to manipulate BTC which has a dirt cheap market cap right now. BTC is very volatile in how it moves already. Or they simply command a politician to outlaw ownership and require all trackable BTC to be turned or face a penalty. So you will hand it over in exchange for worthless CentralBank FedCoin which has an unlimited quantity that they just start this all over again but Digital, BTC becomes the standard...or just deleted. That happened with Gold and Silver, the people were ordered to turn it in in exchange for reserve notes. It worked because the masses trusted the government then and complied. Today we do not trust banks nor governments. The people will need to demand this. Why we are seeing the start of smear campaigns and misinformation about Bitcoin rampant. They are trying to create a stigma of it as a drug and laundering asset only. Or a giant scam. Why it’s great when others point out USD cash is waaaaaaaaay more used for drugs, death,laundering, bribes, etc. no ledger to see if a politician magically had $1,000,000 deposited after passing a law in their accounts.

Bitcoin...the only asset so rare, cheap, and sought after globally that a $1500 drop can be shrugged off and you give it a few days to recover. Unlike a stock or Gold that takes years to recover.
Also keep in mind it has had more adoption in 10 years that the internet in its first 10 years, I think we all know how that story played out....cause, your on it right now.
Be happy your investment has the ability to crash and recover in months not decades. It will stabilize once less rich people day trading are in.

Before the great depression the rich elite tank in the stock market so they could buy control of everything for next to nothing as they had sold all of their stock the year before knowing they would cause the collapse I thoroughly expect big coin to crash allowing panic sale again so they can buy it for pennies then they will search it up as they will hold almost all of it.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:22:20
They cannot own the assets, they just want to own the “highways” they run on to regulate it and monitor. They want to control the roads and probably make sure they get “tolls” for everything. Idiots fail to realize for the price of one stealth fighter they could probably own 51% of BTC lmao.

If he trusts privately owned central banks like the federal reserve and feels that the rich and bankers in general look out for the little people as opposed to helping rich friends and making themselves richer...if he trusts them to look out for his interests and that the $22 trillion debt is a myth, then no, investing in BTC is a waste for him and we will simply be fools. He must believe the USD will be solid forever and we have never pissed off other countries, he must think your nuts if you say the word Petrodollar.

Yesterday and today there is/was. Facebook is before congress regarding Libre and getting pulverized. Basically Trump and the rest of the Central Banks are scared shitless of losing the ability to print money from nothing. I mean I do get it...honestly I do, once the USA loses its ability to print trillions of dollars “out of thin air” and the other countries wake up realizing the power of BTC and some other cryptocurrencies, they lose power over slaves. The rich do NOT want crypto to occur.
For BTC though many need to know while we do hold on and not really spend, it is officially digital gold which in a way is bad because BTC is being dropped by many companies as “nobody is spending it”. Lol. Well nobody spends gold either.

Revolution, as some say...the genie is out of the bottle. If Governments were smart they would own some BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:37:49
As odd as it is, BTC is very cheap Still, so it’s very very easy to manipulate. I mean regarding normies vs rich. For rich, $1,000,000 is nothing, so they can buy/sell fast like a day trader. Whales like this exist as Bitcoin grows, especially on Wall Street with short sellers manipulating all trades in all sectors. 
Why the 21 Million locked is genius. As it grows people will start saying Sats over Bitcoin as BTC will be very hard to get. More Normies buy in, the next time the rich buy in they one day will see there are none to be had. Supply and Demand will then skyrocket the price.  Long term I simply see Bitcoin as it has evolved. A safe finite digital gold global currency will be pegged to. When it is more distributed it will calm down on swings. But unlike stocks, $1000 down on Bitcoin is recoverable in days not years. We are at the opening stages and the current elite are wanting to see the fiat stay alive....because it’s what they have lots of to keep them relevant. They lose they that lose their power over the slaves. Some governments are becoming smart though and taking small positions, the USA spend the entire bitcoin market cap each year on R&amp;D for warfare.  Right now??? 1 less F-22 Raptor would give them huge wealth in a BTC future.  But to do that would kill the USDs validity as a show of no faith. I’d make a dumby account and buy then send it after the inevitable fall of the USD. Bitcoin is showing its usefulness in perfect test case scenarios albeit unfortunate ones...but it’s why we have it. Families are able to send Bitcoin in real-time to each other globally to help. Venezuela for example, good luck sending gold/silver, but BTC??? They can eat at a restaurant with no money and buy the time the check comes? They have it in their wallet to pay. 
I wish there was a cap so long term greed can not intervene, but one step at a time.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:20:15

@_date: 2019-11-22 15:52:33
Buy small amounts, money you don’t care to lose. BTC is imo not even out of the womb yet. We need to remember, it’s going to war to allow freedom from governments getting to powerful and stripping the mega billionaires from power. Redefining open global currency which touches every human. It will be a decades long fight. BTC does everything the reserve banks hate, that’s a very good thing. If you want short term, stocks??? Stock market being heavily manipulated and in a bull market. Sell before trump leaves and corporate tax cuts vanish. Will be a huge sell off as on paper it will look like they are losing money.

Hoping it smears out the supply to more people so one day the market is not controlled by super whales. See BTC in the hands of the masses of normal people for true adoption.
@_date: 2019-11-22 00:01:06
It’s been on a downward trend since July, popped a few times thanks to a couple of whales. BTC is still vital to the future but I am holding to accumulate more at lower levels in larger quantity. I’m ok with the drops if it smears out the Sats from one whale to millions of people.

‘Tis a risk, but we will have many more of these over the years, BTC becoming more known and with digital currency inevitable from reserve banks many are seeing the scary consequences when you do not own your own money. Aside from China, many “elites” who own the banks and politicians will be able to force you to except their tyrannical laws and if you hesitate they can click a button to instantly shut off your and your families ability to buy food and shelter. Worst case scenario but why BTC is the best. We have probably imo a full decade before it’s all digital and those who still own the reserve bank will be engaging in a battle to ensure they own a “crypto” FedCoin.

Congrats on the sub- 10
And I truly think based on the globe right now we will see under eight again.

Not likely normies will have access to quantum computers any time in the next 50-100 years IMO. You need to read up on the power needed to run let alone the cooling. Put it this way, a 360mm water cooled radiator won’t cut it. It need to be colder than space. 
Also SHOULD that occur with quantum, yeah it could happen, but now imagine the ease of cracking banks. With Bitcoin being decentralized you need to work far far harder. It’s attacking hundreds of thousands of nodes if not more. Banks? One location since centralized. I mean I’d only be worried by banks if the ever got hacked once before already.......oh.....crap that’s right. They do. 
It doesn’t matter anyways we are in a digital world all transactions are now digital it doesn’t matter what is backing it even if you had a currency back by digital gold the same scenario could play at using quantum computers. The simple aspect is make a global law that any tampering or manipulation with it carries penalties so great that it carries medieval like penalties. You are a hacker that violates trust/law? then do like they do in the Middle East if you steal you lose your hands. Life in prison no chance of parole ever.
I am sick and tired of the good needing to suffer for the bad the bad simply need to suffer for the bed in the bed simply need to be petrified of doing bad because will also be using quantum computers at that point to be capturing people that use quantum computing to crack keys.

Bitcoin is only just one of the biggest world changing inventions, so why own any of that huh. Internet changed communications, Bitcoin changing Money. Imagine if you could buy a small percent of the internet knowing there is a fixed supply. Yeah.... those who are in it now I feel are the second wave of early adopters and not the first ones who early on we’re just playing around with it. I think the second wave adopters are the ones whom are paying attention to the global economy and no longer have trust in the leaders and see the writing on the wall. So it is a safety measure to earn a valuable digital asset where you can move your money safely quickly and cheaply. My ass will never own one bitcoin so I have no visions of ever being rich but simply want the means to be able to buy food or water with a digital asset. To me buying crypto is finally my hedge against the central banks whom I have absolutely no faith in.Then I buy a little bit of silver and very little bit of gold to round out the possibilities

Shorting should be illegal. In stocks and in crypto, shorting is only used in manipulation and adds no value. Opening Bitcoin to this is the only thing that made me think to leave BTC. If a Billionaire can manipulate us now and slice of 10% in minutes, it’s easy to short unregulated markets and then governments will scream saying “see!! This is why WE need to control it!...and we will, with FedCoin! You’re welcome!”

Where is the dip to 3000? And it’s still risky. Also it’s not expensive. That’s the issue with so few whales owning the market. Remember u only need 0.28 to be a 1%er. And that’s when using 21.000.000 when we all know many millions have been forever lost.

Some google dude ran the numbers, based on total human population. If you hold 0.28 BTC then only 1% of the total population of earth could hold more than you. So it was my baseline to target, my initial goal. Since we have been in a bear market with no sign of retracing and a US election year, stock markets are being heavily manipulated. And the instability IMO comes from the fact millionaires and billionaires can control the markets with ease. BTC needs to grow faster but the super rich and Reserve Banks will not allow it until they are set up in the pole position first. THEN they will pull the rug from the peasants. But then again, we have China prototyping a dystopian society and the Privately owned reserve banks will want to own the digital currency to keep people in line. BTC is a threat to their control. “Do as I say or we will lock your government issued wallet and all those you are connected to.” Wait till they start imprinting QR Codes onto babies as they are born.

I agree with you, BAKKT was just the doorway, with no doorway it’s much harder to get in and cause a fuss. And for millionaires and billionaires BTC is less than dirt cheap to manipulate at even $20,000 let alone $9,000. Why I wish short selling was not allowed on any exchange ever.

As long as the USA shadow of military forces stands tall over them reminding others what’s gonna happen if they stop using the USD as a global currency, it’s just easier to print 1000. I mean we have a law that says the Fed can never be audited sooo....
Fedcoin will be easier because they’ll just add a zero with a keystroke. But will be traceable and if u disagree with them they will lock you out and starve u and ur family.

Big banks making economy look fantastic, all a fraud and hurting BTC. Now with BAKKT which I was never a fan of IMO will hurt us. For big money, Bitcoin is laughably cheap, so I see some major market manipulation incoming and shorting. If I recall though they need to pay with BTC with BAKKT??

Agree to disagree, virtually every wealthy person I have meet have broken or is breaking the law in some way, I have learned that there is absolutely a story behind those riches. I lived near the island of Palm Beach, I was in a few relationships with some ladies who happened to live there and as such I got to meet quite a few people frequently name dropped on msnbc, etc. Not all are assholes but a vast majority absolutely look at non-rich as vermin’s. Many of them discuss business and I’m stunned at the laws being broke or the extreme unethical acts. I even met a guy who was a new millionaire, he landed a huge contract on his first gig with zero experience...Adidas. It was for providing security or something, I asked how’d he do that, “I lied.”. 
They absolutely say one thing to the people but off camera, it’s shocking. Not to mention very dark vibes, almost satanic and I don’t believe in that crap. These people were in most cases billionaires. As they say, spidey senses were going off. 
You cannot trust them. As for jobs, it’s meant to be slavery. As they say “keep them poor” and that’s all they care about, it’s why many of them I would hear DO have escape plans for when the poor and middle class realize what they are doing.
Sounds fake I get it, but it’s all true. Believe or not, I won’t lose sleep over it if u do.

Now I can target my 0.28 BTC goal :) but only at mid 7s, very doable in panic manipulation I feel

Jokes aside, if diamonds were not artificially priced by DeBeers, it would align with the value of that beauty :)
