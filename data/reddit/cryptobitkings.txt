I like to pretend each satoshi is 1 dollar in value since that's what it will be worth 40 years from now lol

What's going to happen is almost over night there will be a massive paradigm shift in the worlds view of wealth, once that happens btc will skyrocket in price until there is literally no btc left to sell accept the small amount being mined every 10 minutes which gets cut in half every 2 years.  At that point miners will stop selling bitcoin for fiat to exchanges because why would anyone trade there extremely rare bitcoin for valueless paper?  This is what will happen within the next 10 years making bitcoin insanely hard to get and that is why 1 satoshi will be equal to what we consider 1 dollar today.

I know it sounds insane but just look up how many dollars circulate the globe and compare it to the number of satoshi in existence currently.  Its definantly possible with mass adoption

The tron blockchain is epic, you must like XRP garbage
@_date: 2019-09-01 18:28:46
The only alt coin that has a valuable use is tron because transactions are instant and it only cost 1 trx to send
