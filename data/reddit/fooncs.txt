Nah. I think ill just have to deal with it. No point dwelling on the mistake now........ guess ill just have to warn others about those fake promises . Bitcoin cant and wont replace fiat currency. They are too volatile......
Just treat bitcoin as an investment, a speculation , or a gambling game

does this mean we have to deal with the occasionally long (few hours) confirmation time, unless we spent more on transaction fee?
does this mean bitcoin usefulness is actually in the hand of those miners?? 
so what does that segwit actually do? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:25:41
i would say human emotion, such greed and FOMO play a big part
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:08:50
i dont understand.....i thaught the segwit would've solved all these high fee and long confirmation time
WTF is happening
