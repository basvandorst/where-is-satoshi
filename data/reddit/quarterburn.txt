This is the thing that fascinates me. The idea that there’s even a sliver of hope that this one particular crypto currency will somehow go north of 20,000 because it lives in some imaginary vacuum. 
Since you are so confident that you’ll be pinging me, you care to divulge what you think the catalyst of the next moonshot will be? Or is it simply hope?

August of 2011 at PAX. Standing in line waiting to get in on Saturday. That was 7 years ago. By your definition Mass Effect 3 has “barely” been out because that’s where I first got to play it. 
Make no mistake. I do not doubt the tech. I’ve got a paper wallet of a minuscule amount of bitcoin when it peaked my interest a couple of years after that. My incredulity started as the hype increased and it went from currency to “investment”. It’s going to be years before this tech stabilizes and becomes a part of everyone’s life like smartphones are now. But the short sighted religion this sub practices is amusing and that’s why I’m here.

It certainly isn’t bitcoin. In order to be a threat, people have to **actually** use it as a form of currency. Something that takes a couple of seconds to complete a transaction, not minutes. Something that you are willing to use to pay without wondering if you just gave away currency that will be worth 10x more a month from now. 
Also how delusional can you be if you think the banks won’t take over bitcoin the way cable companies took over the internet? The entire point of the internet was a hippy ideal of the freedom of information. Freedom from the control of the powers that be. It **was** a threat to the RIAA and MPAA 20 years ago. Try torrenting anything nowadays without a secured connection and your immediately threatened and/or fined.

Nope. It’s just fun watching reality crashing down on the delusion. 
...or maybe I really am a nine year old sockpuppet account playing the long con. Who knows!

How can you be this obtuse? There are over a thousand different crypto currencies you can buy right now. If that’s not the definition of “willy nilly” then nothing is. Dogecoin was created as a joke. You know many precious metals that were created as a joke form of currency?
And here’s the real kicker, what is there to stop a group of banks coming together to create their own crypto currency and putting their full weight behind it to get it adopted? What’s to stop them from inflating the transaction time of rival coins to choke them out?

Okay fine. So by your definition either your going by adoption rate which in that case the Edsel is “barely getting started” or you go by years in which case Uber would also just barely be getting started. Either way you slice it, you’re definition is severely skewed. Seriously, name another technology created in the last 10 years that “still needs time” but is also hyped beyond belief.
