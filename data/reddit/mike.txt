Bitcoin is a store of value! It's not a p2p electronic cash system. BTC is high-fee digital gold, duh!! OMG, Theymos already told us that the whitepaper is just a historical document with no real value. omg what noobs. If you want cheap, fast, payment system use Bitcoin Cash (which is the coin described in the whitepaper).

@_date: 2017-12-13 20:03:27

you sound like a scoundrel. roger bought btc at $1...you probably thought btc was a scam then too. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:23:50
how have i "scammed" anyone? you are delusional, friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:12:26
that is not an argument. which "scams" has he been involved in? his crypto holdings are majority bch as he has claimed numerous times.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:41:43
You can buy $10 worth of bitcoin for $35 you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:26:56
BTC is a store of value I thought? why are you trying to make payments with it?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:00:41
In what way is it a "scam". I'm all ears.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:40:35
currently creating and ending a L channel will cost north of $100? how is this a solution at all?

You guys who incessantly claim that Roger and Jihan are in cahoots would make great screen play writers.
