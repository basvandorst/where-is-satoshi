Dude I'm not trying to start shit but you are still not paying attention...let me break it down farther for you...
1) Yes I agree you are still down the ORIGINAL amount.
2) I agree you can never lower the actualy dollar amount you are down.  You can never get back to even.
But just please answer this simple question for me.  Just say A, B or C....
Let's say you have X which equals the amount of money you are down expressed as a dollar amount.
If you invest more money (making your total investment amount larger)... If you divide X by your NEW total investment amount and compare it to X divided by your SMALLER original investment is it
A) the same
B) smaller
C) larger
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:51:42
Yes all three of us agree on that.  It changes the PERCENTAGE amount you are down.
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:43:34
So keep reposting questions in weed forums that were already asked.
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:19:43
Well anyone who invests more into something thinks it will eventually go back up.
Are you buying more bitcoin now, or holding?  What is your strategy?
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:07:06
I hope you didn't just waste your time writing all of that on a Saturday because I'm not reading any of it.  Have a good day ��
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:49:04
I completely agree with what you are saying but that is not what he was trying to say in the original post.  
He was saying of you add to your total investment you lower the percent you are down.  That's it lol.
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:09:14
I was down 99% before but now I'm only down 1% ������
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:12:48
That's your opinion if the point is moronic.  So are you saying everyone on reddit who dollar cost averages in bear markets is moronic?
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:46:52
Look at your post history buddy.  You wonder why your posts get deleted.  You lack basic reading comprehension skills.
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:58:03
Okay well now I have to agree with the other guy that you are not listening.  It cannot go to 0.  But it can approach 0.
So let me ask you something:  If you are down $99 out of $100 and down $99 out of $10,000, those two percentages are the same??
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:22:35
I thoroughly enjoyed this thread guys.  Please continue ��...
But Auwardamn basically what he is saying is this in an extreme exaple:
Say you start with $100 and you lose $99, you are at $1.  You are down 99%.  Now if you invest another $9900 you are in for $10,000 now and have $9,901.  You are still down $99 but you are now down less than 1%.
So you are still down the same dollar amount but the actual percent you are down is less.  And since everyone in here is talking about what percent they are down, this is a way to reduce it. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:42:38
If you would learn how to read you would realize his response had nothing to do with the original point the other guy was making.
Fact: If you add on to your original investment the percent you are down on your total investment is now smaller.  
He tried saying the percent on your original lot is still the same.  Which is obvious.  But we weren't discussing the original lot.  The entire thread is about percent down on total investment.

They would only access your private keys after you died.  What point are you trying to make?  That a hardware wallet isn't safer than coinbase?
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:24:48
OK I can play this game.  So you have 100 bitcoin.
1) Write instructions for your estate to restore your bitcoin address to a new wallet.  It's pretty trivial.
2) Write out how you want that bitcoin divided up between your living relatives.
The same way your estate would divide up your house, bank accounts, anything else.  If you died and your 6 year old son was your only living relative he wouldn't be the one handling any of this.  If you wrote out clear instructions and/or had a will this wouldn't be an issue.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:51:26
And the point I am trying to make is hardware wallets or paper do not have to have any vulnerabilities unless you want them to.  Releasing your private keys in a will is a vulnerability that one could choose to have but it isn't mandatory.
If I generate an address offline and choose to not share it with anyone, then no one is getting access to it.  It's that simple.
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:02:20
If anything it would be a ponzi scheme not a pyramid scheme because you don't need to recruit people to make money.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:03:27
Actually if your hardware wallet catches on fire you can restore it to a different device with your backup seed  So it is bullet proof.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:15:59
...you write them simple instructions to?  The same way you'd split up a $100,000 piece of jewelry you have if you died?
@_date: 2017-04-18 02:37:07
But if you pay $1000 USD you dont get 1000 USDTs rught?  It'll be like 990 USDTs or something?
@_date: 2017-04-18 03:50:58
I just realized tether is owned by bitfinex.  Bitfinex halted deposits so does that mean tether did too?
@_date: 2017-04-18 00:47:42
So how should I even get money onto poloniex?  Pay outrageous fees and buy it through coinbase and then transfer it on?
@_date: 2017-04-18 01:42:08
How easy is that.  How are the fees?
@_date: 2017-04-18 00:35:14
Darn.  That's what I suspected.  Thought I might be missing something.

When is the "near future"? And what part of the world do you live in where you think food will be free soon?
@_date: 2019-09-30 16:50:21
When do you see this happening? By what year will I be able to eat good meals completely for free the entire year?
@_date: 2019-09-30 16:26:24
Nothing is free in life. Google giving away food for free is because they are taking it out of their employee's paychecks. Food will never at any point be completely free because farmers or butchers use their own resources and time to make that food for us.

@_date: 2017-07-25 17:28:36
Say Bitcoin is $3000 and you have one bitcoin.  When it splits, if BCC if $500 does that automatically mean BiTC should go down to $2500?  Do the two coins sum to the original price?
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:24:11
So we won't get 80% in this current period but maybe in the next one?
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:30:50
Nothing is happening on Aug 1st though right?  We just have to wait for segwit to be activated in a couple of weeks I thought.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:05:58
Give him an upvote then :-)
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:43:53
Ok thanks that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:17:42
Don't we need 80%?  Looks like it's only 75% ish on xbt.eu
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:29:05
I'm curious about this too.
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:24:14
Who is this guy?  Why does he feel so confident?
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:18:40
Interesting i see.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:35:58
So what is likely to happen to the price then?
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:02:14
Evrryone is talking about gdax.  Gdax IS the exchange behind coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:57:16
So what are all of these inbetween dates?  Like segwit being activated on July 21st?
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:15:39
It actually is a very good question because literally 95% of people do not fully understand what is going on.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:20:16
I'm not sure how to do that but maybe look into a hardware wallet like a ledger nano s?  Just as private and very easy to use.
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:57:41
Just use gdax and do a same day bankwire.
And about the ledger....they have them on amazon.  If not just use jaxx, mist or myetherwallet until the ledger can ship.
