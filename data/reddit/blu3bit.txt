Yes... these kinds of problems and AltCoin as a solution to the problem was even predicted years back. Digging around in Bitcointalk talk forum can be amazing:  Not to sure about the Primecoin allocation suggested in the post though ;-)

OTC. look it up. as long as you're not selling drugs (yes you might be lying to us) and pay your taxes, over the counter might be a good way of going about it.

The thing with UASF (If Im not misstaken which I very well might be) is that you do need miners to mine blocks with the transactions BUT there is no need to update the consensus rules just as with a regular softfork ( nodes running old software will still relay what they think are still valid blocks.
UASF is basically a regular softfork but instead of having the miners signaling readiness, there is a flag day when nodes just "suddenly" start running the new agreed upon code, without miners having been signaling in advance. This could work because the softfork doesnt require any changes to the consensus rules. However the transactions that makes use of the new feature must be included in blocks, because if they are not, they do not exist in the blockchain. Hence at least one miner have to include these type of new transaction in a block. Other miners can choose to reject that block as a valid block - but then they would in reality be hard forking it (because there was nothing in the block that broke consensus).
Anyway... the miners are needed to burn energy to create a block. If no energy was required to create a block, then everyone could create as money blocks they wanted and then there would be no consensus. The only other way of doing it, would be to secure the blockchain using some sort of federated approach where a group of entities vouch for the integrity of the blockchain. In Proof-of-Stake the group are using the coins themselves when vouching. Some people dont think Proof-of-Stake works, but I think it could work. BUT, it would never be able to produce an "objective truth" only a subjective one... in a Proof-of-Stake secured system you could create a long long blockchain without any real cost and present it as a legit one and who could say that it is not? Especially new nodes joining the network could have a hard time figuring out which blockchain is the real one... in Bitcoin this problem doesnt exist, because the blockchain which burned the most energy in its Proof-of-Work is always the real one.
Another interesting approach is a hybrid one, where Proof-of-Work is used to mine blocks and Proof-of-Stake is used to vote on the validity of the mined blocks. The argument, if I'm not wrong (which again I might very well be, because I not an expert by far) is that mining centralization could be mitigated because even if there was only one miner, only blocks that was also OK by the Proof-of-Stake verifiers would be integrated into the blockchain.
My personal take on the whole thing, is that Im am ignorant Bitcoin maximalist second and a trader first. Since my understanding of Bitcoin is too shallow, I need to hedge my bets and also buy coins in other types of networks using other kinds of consensus models. That way, if Bitcoin fails, the other could still survive and I would be hedged.
Actually I think there is not a single person on the planet that know for sure how exactly this will all play out. The thing about Bitcoin though, is that this consensus model is "pure" in the technical sense I think.
There is nothing wrong with federated consensus either, BUT then you put trust in entities and not physics (PoW is all about the laws of physics, which can not be broken by people (cryptography however can, so that is still an issue for sure)).
The only thing that is for certain is that people will try to exploit and crack what ever network we're using.

I think UASF is different from federated consensus. In federated consensus, you have entities vouching for the integrity of the chain/database. In UASF there is no vouching for integrity at all, only nodes that on a specific date and time, starts broadcasting segwit tx. Federated consensus do work, so you don't need a PoW and miners... well... it works until it doesn't. I mean, how can you prove for certain that the entities in the federated consensus are not colluding? Actually you can't. In PoW the only thing you need to prove, is which chain has the most work spent on it and that you can prove using cryptography. Miners might be colluding (as for an example they might agree on not including transactions from this or that address) and stuff like that... but they can't take your money (only keep you from not spending or receiving it) but as soon as a new miners steps in and include that transaction, you're home. If Bitcoin also gets improved privacy features (which I think we will get in the future) it will be even more difficult for miners to do stuff like that. Im no expert on these things though...

Impossible to know the answer to that question. Probably there will be even worse times in the future (especially if you think that Bitcoin someday in the distant future will go away and be replaced by something else). My guess would be "no" not the worst time, there will be much worse times.

Oh I think they will still be in the game... if they don't fork now, they can always do it later. Thinking of it... if it worked so well for them this time, they sure as h3ll will try it again at some point in the future.

Yea, futs players goes short and cheap btc accumulated by hodlers ftw.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:05:36
I'm confident bitmain is short BTC, because they basically HAVE to hedge their mining operations. Hence it's also in their interest to make sure the short doesn't blow up in their face so they have to make sure that the FUD sticks. Then when they eventually cover, they can simply just start signaling segwit or what ever OR the whole world cave in and they get their big blocks and increase their centralization grip. Heads they win, tails they win.
The big looser here is time. If price close below 900 here on the weekly chart, things might snowball down to 500 or even 400 and at that point we're officially in a bear market again... sigh... we loose time.

Don't recall exactly that one, but do remember some other crazy ones.
For instance, there was this guy who had gone into debt, I believe it was some serious money he borrowed from the bank. He borrowed it below $50 I think and then people told him to sell when price was hitting three digits. Needless to say what he should have done, in hindsight ;-), is to have doubled down and taken on even more debt - but the advice I remember giving him was to take enough profit to at least pay down the debt and then just hold the bitcoins if he wanted too.
There was a lot of crazy stuff like that a few years back. I guess there is still people borrowing with house as collateral and then buying AltCoins but I don't visit those subs I wouldn't know.

For questions like these,  is your friend.
But to answer your question. Yes, you can do this very easily, but you will need a computer that you can trust won't send the data somewhere. It all depends on the level of paranoia (i.e. amount of bitcoins your holding).
You could booti up your computer from a USB-stick, make sure your not connected to internet and then use Bitcoin Core, Electrum and import the private key.

Since talk of Litecoin is accepted here nowadays I believe its safe to talk about Peercoin too? People have been talking about the issues with PoW centralization for ages, Proof-of-Stake is an attempt to solve among other things, such issues.

To bad not everyone have a 3D-printer yet and that they're not yet sophisticated enough to create PoW chips.
Without naming and pumping (so I guess a yes/no reply) any specific AltCoin, do you think there is anyone even close to offering a PoW solution that would be better Bitcoin then the one we have now?
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:41:47
Good point! While on that topic. Do you think a botnet resistant PoW already exists (which would also have a big enough user base from the start)? If no such PoW exist yet, how long do you expect to take before someone invents it?
By the way, thanks for your contributions to Bitcoin. :-)
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:56:01
I don't think its proof of nothing. I think its similar to a federated model, where you trust the stakers to not do things that would damage the value of the coins they have staked.
What I like about PoW is that you really do need to spend energy when hashing and the energy spent can be both measured and not be faked. In PoW someone running 100% of all the miners, still need to mine the blocks and spend energy and you can prove that this is being done.
But PoW is not without it risks. I do think mining centralization is a big problem and I really don't see it going away. These were my fears several years ago and still is. However, now mining centralization is worse then ever. Not only do you have some big entities, also the hardware manufacturing is centralized. Unfortunately in some cases it's one and the same. I don't see any reason why this should change anytime soon and right now it also seems to be one of things holding innovation back. I mean... I thought PoW was going to be centralized and feared what it meant for the 51% scenario but I didn't imagine things like the whole ASICBoost and Antbleed.
What I'm trying to say here is that no-one knows for sure if PoW will work or not, or if for some reason it will fail.
PoS lack some of the features I love about PoW, but just as PoW isn't a solution to the Byz. problem and only a work around, PoS might just be good enough to work.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:41:02
I arrived at this "feature not a bug" conclusion by thinking about PoW on my own. I'm not a super idiot, yet it took me a long time to come to this understanding - because I never came across it on internet.
Is there a FBM (Frequent Bitcoin Misconceptions :-) ) on the internet, to which one could point old and new Bitcoin curious people too? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:53:56
Do you think its possible to get enough ASICs (with a new PoW) into the hands of enough miners, to make it more decentralized then what it is today?
