Go to the aforementioned forums and look for sellers.

This was after the first three days, if I recall, and is relatively old news at this point. It's been posted here before and the repost implies that they hit $500,000 recently rather than nearly a week ago.

This subreddit doesn't seem to agree, unfortunately. Pretty silly.

Who are "those guys"? It was tweeted by TigerDirect - I'd assume they're a credible source for their own financials.

As others have already pointed out, Karpeles himself admitted the validity of the document in an IRC interview with the caveat being that it was not prepared by MtGox. They are valid documents.
Additionally, if you read his blog, you would see that he did not personally profit on the price swings. He sold prior to releasing the document and actually lost money given the very quick rebound that bitcoin made. The price swinging doesn't mean he has an ulterior motive.
Finally, Andreas was not discrediting the document/blog. He was attacking MtGox and the claims of the document itself.

I don't really see how it's "drama queening" when people have lost millions of dollars because of the company's total incompetence.

To elaborate, they use MtGox vouchers to transfer them to your Gox account.

He's inferring that it would drop the price and that the price would stop dropping/having price shocks due to rumors about the Chinese ban that never actually had happened.

Current PT employee of Best Buy here and formerly store leadership (very recent departure). He was full of shit.

You have a few options.
1. Wait it out and hope that you're eventually able to withdraw your money. I'm honestly not sure what your odds are here, as the latest press release has really shaken my faith in Gox - but it's your only option for getting the full value of your BTC.
2. Sell your Gox BTC for BTC at a reduced rate. The Bitcointalk forums have a lot of this going on, and I've bought some Gox BTC with BTC on there myself. Just realize you will not get full value if you go this route.
3. Sell your BTC on Gox and eventually try to withdraw the fiat. This is honestly the least appealing in my mind, but there's more safety in holding fiat on MtGox than there is in holding BTC if it comes down to liability on their part.

Read b44rt's post. I'm on a phone and can't write it out but it should be very clear that you misunderstood it.

Coinbase is the easiest way to obtain Bitcoins if you're from the US and don't want to do any significant amount of trading to start, as it has pretty minor requirements with regards to your identity and can be set up instantly. Just be aware that there are some frankly draconian limits in place if you intend to buy a significant amount instantly.

Do you want to back that claim up with anything remotely substantive?
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:19:31
No, it's not.
