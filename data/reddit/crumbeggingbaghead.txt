Yes , its the future . There is no way that bitcoin is not going to be part of the future. Even if they drop after you buy them don't worry because in the long term they will surely rise. Dont keep putting it off buy now. 
This comment is based on my belief in bitcoin, i have seen them go from pennies to thousands of dollars in a few years . 
Buy some today , and hodl . 
The future you will be a millionaire

Hey , im really not sure which one will prevail, i tend to think bitcoin original rather than bitcoin cash , i base this on how much i have seen bitcoin rise , i first got into bitcoin when they were 8gbp each and now they are sitting nicely above 2k which is a hell of a rise in 4 or 5 years  , i just saw other comments saying bitcoin are at the peak value , people were saying that when they were 300gbp
im honestly not sure about bitcoin cash as obviously these are relatively new , i would advise if u were to invest to go for bitcoin original or maybe go 50/50 . Bitcoin is the original though and thats why i think that will be the more dominant coin as more people are familiar with it and when bitcoin cash is mentioned it still has bitcoin in the name , more places accept btc than bch , although most people that hold bitcoin will hold the same in bch now so that is anyones guess at this early stage . Sorry cant offer anything concrete but going on my own experience I would say btc . I talked a friend into investing in btc when they were 880gbp each , they rose and hes happy , then last week when they dropped to 1400 he was getting worried and wanted to sell but again i talked him into hodl'ing and he is glad he did. Good luck whatever you decide  , future millionaire

Yes people use it for purchasing on a regular basis , mainly for drugs but its still purchasing 
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:57:17
Haha this is spot on accurate, first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is check preev for bitcoin price , if i wake up in the night i check , and i check at least 15 times a day if not more ��
Im a hodler tho so when it drops it doesn't bother me too much . Bitcoin and cryptos are the future and i have good belief in them

Try a transaction accelerator maybe 
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:20:08
Hodl 
Put it somewhere safe and forget about it for a year or two . Go about your daily business without even thinking about it . Check btc value in a couple of years time and smile

My wifes auntie fell for a very similar scam, of Facebook as well , they told her she was buying shares of a mining pool or some bullshit , her not being clued up fell for it and bank transfered some money, they then phoned her and asked her for more and she said she would send it in the morning more money but luckily she phoned us before making second payment and i said sorry to tell you but it’s a scam , she was like how can it be a scam , its on Facebook it’s legit �� only 500 gbp she sent , or so she said. Never sent the other payment thankfully and she hasn’t mentioned it since so i think she’s embarrassed for falling for it . These scammers are out there for easy pickings like this 
. Your friend learned an expensive lesson though , ouch
