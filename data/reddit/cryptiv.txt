Thanks, feedback is always welcome! We hope to push some changes and updates to help improve the user experience in following weeks.
Also, Firefox plugin coming soon!
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:12:52
The extension is optional, just used to inject links into your social content stream to make tipping easier.
You can tip directly from our website and use all of our features without the extensions
Firefox plugin is on the way.

Yup, you can claim tips either directly from your dashboard or from the link thats usually sent along with the message. 
Its just one quick click and the tip is sent to your wallet. 
A little more rewarding than having your balance updated automatically and it also allows for unclaimed tips to be returned to the sender after they expire.

Cryptiv has already built something similar to this.
You can send Bitcoin to anyone on Twitter, Youtube, and Twitch.tv.
If you got friends on any of those sites and want to get them started with Bitcoin you can easily send them some via Cryptiv and they'll have their first wallet.
Check us out! We are an early stage Bitcoin startup and would love the support.

User friendly micro-transactions is what we are all about! Check us out:
Here’s how it works:
You can send and receive tips on Youtube, Twitter, Twitch.tv, and via email all from your single Cryptiv wallet.
We offer a Chrome browser extension that inputs a tip-button directly onto the social media network. No bot, no commands. Just click and tip.
Check out our video to see how it works: 
You can tip anyone on the platforms we support, even if the user does not have an account with Cryptiv.
Just let them know you tipped them and once they register with us and link their social account all of the tips that had been sent to that social account will be there waiting.
Feedback is welcome! Let us know at support
We are working on a number of very exciting features that will help move the ecosystem beyond tipping - stay tuned.
