Totally agree, coin will be $200,000 by then
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:29:47
I’m not
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:55:03
I like the sound of that

If it makes you feel any better about my life experience, I’ll be taking no advice from reddit on my investments.

Yeah I know what he said don’t try to pretend like it was a relevant or useful comment that didn’t warrant a “what?”

I think it would be foolish to sell for at least another 2 years. After that we’ll all have a much better idea of its place in the market going forward, as well as its value. The next two years will be a rollercoaster tho.  Also you spelled hodl wrong.

The vast majority of my money is in bitcoin. Even if there are alt coins with better technology or benefits, BTC has the name value now, and every market has a pacemaker. There will be plenty of Burger King’s and Pepsi’s, but bitcoin will be the McDonald’s or the Coke. The technology only matters to the 1% of people who will fully understand the tech by the time it’s fully integrated, to everyone else it only matters than their friends are using it and amazon accepts it.

Haha I respect your wisdom 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:19:12
But why?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:56:15
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:47:52
Interesting, any particular reason?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:26:53
True, but I’m looking for opinions! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:38:06
Haha right 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:23:14
Yeah prove it
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:08:43
That’s what I’m talking about 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:28:23
Interesting, any specific reason you don’t see value in it? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:00
I’d consider yourself lucky you’re going to get a much better price on coin having waited the last 3 hrs 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:41:11
That doesn’t seem to make much sense to me, you must also be interested in seeing people’s answers if you took the time to comment. I’m just the one who asked the question, tell me you didn’t read the responses.

Bitcoin people don’t want their main product to be universally accepted? Interesting

If you think it’s been more bumpy this last week than it was the week before, you need to learn how to read a graph

It’s a futures market in Chicago that is launching their futures contracts for BTC tonight at 6p eastern time. The CME is another Chicago based futures market and they will be accepting BTC one week from Tomorrow as well.

Yeah you make money. At least if you use your prediction to invest.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:29:24
Wouldn’t want to “loose” it all now would we
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:37:06
Good point, what do you anticipate as an ending value, or value range?
