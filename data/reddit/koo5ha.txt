Where are you located in PA I'm just outside of Philly and would love to stop by if you're close.
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:11:08
How come only certain states are supported? I'm from Pennsylvania, this is a great feature I definitely look forward to using!

Is this how much their rate actually is over there? lol

I like this idea and hope to see it implemented. I am assuming you will just ask for everyone's BTC address? Also, is there anyway to make more requests per minute? I have a pretty nice setup here, it'd be great to put it to some good use.

I'm looking at it now. It looks like more a Bitcoin trading place and not a Bitcoin marketplace :P

How long did it take to confirm? I just sent through an 8 sat per-byte tx. I hope it does not take eight days. :P
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:48:58
Oh no :( That's crazy man. Longest I had to wait was 5 weeks for a 25 sat/byte but that has been taken care of. My 8 sat per byte tx confirmed in 73 minutes. Have you tried to accelerate yours?

Paybase is shutting its doors at the end of the month, they stopped allowing withdraws for weeks. Most people should have seen it coming ages ago.

Your drug, is a heartbreaker...
@_date: 2015-10-01 12:53:09
