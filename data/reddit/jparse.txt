I think we make it interesting. Most people are opening it to check reddit feeds or news feeds. Both of which is what people open coinhub numerous times a day.

This is an app. So that means that it’s being launched 85 times a day on average. That’s bonkers.

This has replaced Facebook and Instagram imho. I can understand why. One of my friends put 500 bucks on BTC. She is now on her phone constantly checking...she’s in New York. In finance.
We made it.

OP is using a [data network]( But CP has the same issue as CMC. They both use polling. So what that means is that they connect to all 250+ exchanges and get the global price. 
[Pitfalls of using CoinMarketCap](
What they should be doing is segmenting highly reputable exchanges in one streaming channel and the others in a separate channel. On the streaming channel, they should be viewing trades only and NOT the tickers. 
This gives better price accuracy. Also price is not very important as news, social and community posts, and code checkins. I dont have an iphone like OP but same data network access can be accessed [here](

Yep, I asked them. You can add as many positions as you want with the same coin. It will calculate gain/loss. Also will calculate forex on the pair if your phone is different than what you bought it as.

Yah more tools, mainstream support from software makers is what the crypto world needs. More mainstream exposure too.
Thanks for spreading the word!
