hahahhaha around 500k? if bitcoin manages to wipe out all of gold market cap and assuming there ~17million coins in action, thats still below 500k a coin.

proof? where is this mentioned
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:11:54
even if true this doesn't mean coinable is at risk and you need to move coins. still safe, and still allows you to be liquid
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:47
bet. I put bcash sky rockets even more. then plummets haha
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:13
If the price got as low as 5k again sure you might see a quick bounce (and could be dramatic yes) but you're also probably seeing major shit happening and it won't hold that 15k

bull trap. Come back to this post late January

You might have messed up, but when trading bch turns live no way you could stomach the even bigger losses btc is about to have. so you saved yourself some money lost in the end. I mean shit look at bitcoin price and it hasn't even gone live yet

It could be bad. Theres two parts. One saying they will ban anonymous accounts linked to crypto (which is good, smart regulation is a good thing for btc). But it also says "closing of virtual coin exchanges." It does not mention closing ones that "don't adhere to regulations," but rather a vague "virtual coin exchanges." period. Depending on what they shut down, that could be very bad for eth and btc.

No one intelligent is arguing with this. To adopt something like bitcoin as a currency, or to use a different coin as a better exchange of course needs negligible volatility. The point is bitcoin is in a price discovery phase, an institutional investor entrance phase, widespread speculation stage, etc. It is after all of this when bitcoin will stabilize, and at what price is what everyone is trying to figure out. If it gets to the point where its not as volatile and can be a currency, thats gonna be a high price. If it doesn't, it will inevitably fail and fall back down

I think bitcoin could go past a billion. Why not, so many people want it
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:31:13
I dont wanna speculate on insider trading but come on, an increase like in bch like it had today and then this at the end of the day
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:55:16
you're also probably trying to trade on a small time frame chart. wait for the daily to look good and not just the big drops in the minute, 5 and so on charts (also assuming you're on gdax). You might be buying in at a point higher than you want from the bottom, but at least then you can take a calculated risk with a stop point. Just hold, for a while though maybe now hahaha

Worldwide ban on bitcoin its going down

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:19
They go hand in hand, you arrive at the same calculation either way.

Thanks, its gonna be real bumpy for a little bit. Don't think I have the stomach to hold anything haha
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:10:13
I know, we have people asking "what makes price go up and down so much" and people trying to draw a cup and handle on a line chart from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:03:21
Hahahaha too good, literally the exact opposite
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:54:44
These smart contracts though, if each person has control of their money, many people won't want to get involved in mortgage lending for instance. So how can you pool enough money to back and get someone something as large as a mortgage. And then to scale that to millions or even billion of people. someone can enter a contract, yet the funding still has to be there
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:36:59
There are other precious metals though
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:49:00
