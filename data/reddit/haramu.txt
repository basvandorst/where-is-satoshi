I see, that's great to know. I'm gonna look into both of these and maybe give one of them a try. Thanks a lot! :D

I have not seen it before. Their fees look reasonable, but looking at their market they have much different prices for buying BTC/USD than gdax. $18,680 vs $18,950 per coin is a pretty sizable difference.
But if I were to transfer BTC from gdax is it a pretty good site for trading from coin to coin though?

Hey there bot! Ya done fucked up on the movie title there, might need to be reprogrammed.

Is there a gdax equivalent for other coins? I really like the site and the lack of fees, but they only offer trading for three coins. Is there something like gdax for other coins, or maybe something similar?
