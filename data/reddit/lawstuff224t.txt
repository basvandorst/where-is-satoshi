I have, Kraken is talking to me directly now in a serious way but the others are ducking me 
There is very little legally I can do, I can file a suit but I doubt I would ever collect, these are actually pretty small and stupidly run companies- they don’t have a legal team for me to really talk with and it’s hard to even pin down the jurisdiction for the lawsuit
Also there tos says they are not responsible for a lot of this, again, I should not have engaged in this crap

You try transferring this many fucking come me at this value 
I am not broke from this, I am a finance lawyer, and everyone told me this would happen if the coins became valuable but it’s still fucking annoying

I tried cashing out and the banks are not getting the money and my wallets are showing errors now saying they are empty and I am not getting any customer support
It’s bullshit

Thank you!
Everyone here is so crazy in denial about this shit!
Half of the posts on here are people having money missing and the other half are people asking how to invest 
It’s like talking to crazy people- I had a friend really into BTC mining just help me buy the shit and even he warned me this could happen- because it’s all a scam!
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:00:21
It’s a fucking disaster

Not fake, truth
Life sux

Looking at your post history you are a neet who is mad incel is banned
Why you do this?
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:12:44
The only people I think doing ok in BTC and other crypto are true tech people who got in at the mining level, not at the buying and selling level, when it was just a new idea based mostly on the tech- now BTC is well beyond that and the tech is really out of reach for most enthusiasts 
Now it reeks to me of just scams, for me the buy in for fun was $100,000 and that’s only because a real estate thing I was doing did not work out and I said fuck lit let’s gamble- and I would have WON if the system itself was not broken

It was just my summer bonus, I didint want to put it into the stock market since its bloated and I did not want a new rental property, so I thought crypto might be fun- everyone called me an ass for doing it 
I literally am getting another 200k at the end of the month for Christmas 
It’s that it was stolen, I really wanted to use that money to finance a movie

Bullshit lol

Just because you don’t have enough money to steal doesn’t mean it’s not true
Go back to incel neet

Not posting that kind of information here 
Fuck off

Cashing out as in selling all my shit- it’s a common term 
Yes, there is collusion among the exchanges, you have no money so how would yo even know what I am dealing with 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:22:06
I am a finance lawyer!
I am trying! It’s shockingly difficult when they are barely a company- these exchanges are small and they don’t really care about legal disputes, they for the most part ignore them since most people involved in BTC are either broke or stupid- I am neither though I was dumb to buy it at all
I will figure out how to contact who ever runs these stupid exchanges even if it’s the last thing I do 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:59:53
This an alt, I am well known, Reddit keeps fucking with me 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:02:01
3 different exchanges over the course of a year, I did not care about them till the spike
Why would I?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:19:19
My experience talking with people here has been that none of them have made ANY MONEY- like even my claim of having bitcoins in the first place or a fucking job to buy them makes them mad- so then when I go on to say that even having the coins is not a guarantee to the money it’s like telling them that there is no god!
It’s not my fault you guys are broke and this shit is a scam- you all know it, half of you are blaming me for trusting the big exchanges and not being constantly paranoid of being to robbed- you are right! That’s why I should not have bought crypto!
Next time it’s real estate or gold or fine art
Ridiculous
