Anyone who previously used Tor for blockchain should probably create new wallets then, yeah?

I don't know. Seems pretty arrogant and illiberal to judge another person for their entirely subjective ordinal values.
Maybe everyone's on their own journey here and maybe it's a cool thing to respect that regardless of how well it jives with your own preferences.

Some people in the community value their personal philosophy more than material comforts. 
Cryptocurrency wasn't created for everyone to get rich quick.

This animation is fucking great.
It makes me feel inadequate as a motion designer.

Yeah, this is what I was thinking. They do significantly more business than Tradehill at the moment, and I'm sure a majority of that business comes through Dwolla. Even if MtGox (or Dwolla itself) is taking the losses, I'm sure in the end it's going to be worth it to them to keep quiet about it since it's the source of the majority of their profit.
They may be trying to protect Bitcoin, too; I imagine if both exchanges stopped using Dwolla and the transaction costs exploded from all of the bank transfers, there would eventually be a lack of buyers, thus crashing btc prices.

Anybody holding is taking a hit, and there's never a guarantee that confidence will be restored.
Instability is generally not what people look for in an actual currency.
I think I'll be staying away from the speculator game for right now; it'll probably bite me in the ass, but still.

Wow. What a bummer.
I'm just now hearing about the mybitcoin problems.
I'm glad I cashed out back after the Tradehill/Dwolla fiasco.
Growing pains suck.

That's a good point.

People should be praised for their growth and change, not simply dismissed for their past mistakes.
