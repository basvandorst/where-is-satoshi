Windows 7 is perfectly secure as long as you install updates immediately. People who get hacked either open exe files from Nigerian princes, or have crappy insecure third party programs like Java (which applies to any OS, not just Windows).

It scares me a bit to think that some of the crazy people on here will become quite wealthy if Bitcoin succeeds long term.
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:54:41
Seems to be a bit lacking in physical security for something which holds so much money (both $ and BTC).

The average consumer? There are people in the world who aren't American. I couldn't really give a fuck what the IRS has to say as it has no impact on me.

MD5 hash of what? If you compile the source yourself, it probably won't be an exact copy of the binary supplied by the developer (even in the absence of malicious extras).

Bitcoin will never become "mainstream" while people still need to worry about paper wallets or security.
The end goal will be people trusting their coins to a reputable bank (yeah, like Neo, but minus the whole scam part) and the bank worrying about this sort of stuff.

Who fucking cares? This just in: person on internet thinks they're tough and makes stupid statements. 
Will I also make it to the front page of this sub if I post a "death threat"? 
@_date: 2014-03-05 08:03:36
No, no... Mr Gox not home... He no have bitcoin...

So if both bitcointalk and this sub are both run by the same scammer, what alternatives are available?

The whole Dogecoin community seems to have the idea that $0.0005 is a lot of money. I wouldn't even waste my time accepting such a small tip.

This sub is full of retarded 14 year olds who think memes and Bitcoin being worth $100,000,000,000 3 months from now are the only things worth posting.
I upvoted you.
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:20:47
Well said. Whilst this may very well just be a PR stunt by Overstock, it's still a real company which really is accepting Bitcoin as payment.
Richard Branson knew perfectly well that nobody was going to pay for a flight in space with Bitcoin. (I realise that one of his employees supposedly did. That was most likely staged as part of the PR too)
It's pretty obvious just how many of these people are doing it for free advertising. So many 2 bit nothing businesses post on here saying "Mary's Tarot Card Readings now accepts Bitcoin!", and receive hundreds of upvotes despite the fact that their website doesn't even mention the word Bitcoin. Virgin Galactic is guilty of this too. Their website never mentioned it either.
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:19:57
Unless you're being pedantic and literally referring to the programming language as opposed to Oracle JRE, then yes it is. Oracle JRE is a horribly insecure pile of crap. I work in computer security and I would never install it unless I had no choice.
See  for one example why.

I bought one of those to keep as a souvenir. If Bitcoin ends up being big then it'll be funny to look back on them in the future.
I never used it (other than briefly to see if it actually worked or not).
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:52:24
I'm also drunk and in my apartment and this isn't funny.
Don't worry, here, I'll downvote my own post for you.

OpenSSL is open source. Nobody found the Heartbleed vulnerability until it was too late. As has been the case many other times with vulnerabilities in open source software.
Being open source doesn't mean anything if nobody, or not the right people, are looking at the code.

Here since 2013, agree with you. If Roger actually succeeds with this, I'd leave crypto completely forever.
I don't give a shit how much money I could have made, having scammers like Roger and Craig Wright in charge is not what I signed up to when I got into BTC.

Here in Japan with incognito mode I get 1) bitcoin.com 2) Wikipedia 3) bitcoin.org
When searching in English, that is. In Japanese 1) bitflyer
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:41:46
Yep. I've been going there daily for a long time, it's clearly been overrun in the past couple of weeks (and has really ramped up in the past few days). Even shit posts are getting dozens of upvotes. It's ridiculous.
I've noticed that the vote brigading seems to come in waves. A post will gradually go up or down over an hour or so as real people vote, then suddenly in the space of 5 minutes it will completely reverse, e.g. +20 to -5
There's a post on the front page about one of their mods shilling bcash. Huge conflict of interest.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:31:48
Testing. I'm just here for the downvotes.

Is Dorian actually into Bitcoin now? When he was interviewed a few years ago, he didn't even know what it was.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:03:24
So, what does this mean exactly? Do the opposite of what he says if you want to make money?
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:19:54
I gave the teller the correct reference and I saw her type it as I watched the keyboard. Even if she made a typo I still think it's unreasonable for it to take this long to get sorted out.
I've put thousands of dollars through Coinjar and found it to be pretty much instant up until now too.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:54:54
And these comments are exactly why it will never crash to $1. The buying support before it gets to $1 is practically infinite.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:02:06
What does this have to do with Bitcoin...?
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:23:31
I downvoted this post down before even clicking on it, but after seeing this comment, I changed it to an upvote. Nicely done.
@_date: 2013-12-31 13:19:18
Why is this on the front page of r/bitcoin? TIL Bitcoin is the same as news about NSA.
Fuck I hate reddit sometimes.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:40:28
You just missed it by 15 minutes. I desperately wanted to buy when it hit $280 but my fiat is stuck in the system for another day or so.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:03:07
I just placed an order for 0.6 BTC and it's put me in the queue even for that. Wtf? I used to have 20 BTC orders delivered immediately.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:09:08
Yes, it's fake.
I on the other hand was volunteering in Kenya to teach English to disadvantaged children. On the day I left, one of them gave me a piece of jewelry he made.
Because it didn't quite fit me, I decided to sell it back home. I got 30 cents for it. I put all the money into Bitcoin, and today it's worth $3 billion! I can't believe how good my judgement was.
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:23:29
Sucks to be whoever thought it was crashing and sold off.

FUD. None of them are "Bitcoin Experts" and you clearly have an agenda to push. Go away.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:47:08
Some of it came from an address which had 10 BTC, and sent all of it to 1HiMoM. Maybe it was the guy with the sign transferring from another wallet rather than someone else.
If not, I'm extremely jealous.
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:19:29
I don't know why you're getting down voted. I completely agree. Yes it's a charity. Yes he's probably doing good things. But the obsession on here with it is just ridiculous. There are millions of charities all around the world, why would I specifically donate to this one rather than one which is more in line with issues I feel are important? As an Australian, homeless people in Florida really isn't the top of my list of priorities.

Thanks! The transaction just came through.
I'm a little bit annoyed that BTC went up 5% since I deposited the cash, but I'll get over it.
Hopefully next time (I will use Coinjar again) it goes more smoothly.
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:39:42
Thanks! So it sounds like almost everyone just have a small number (testing the waters I guess), and a very small number who got in early have massive amounts.
@_date: 2013-11-05 10:30:50
This is what I've done. I printed 10 paper wallets on an air gapped computer which has never, and will never, touch the Internet. I'm putting 10 BTC in each as my goal is to eventually have a total of 100 BTC.
I realise the chance of an address collision is probably lower than a plane crashing into me right now, but why risk losing 100% of your BTC when it takes about 3 seconds work to avoid it?
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:25:18
Me too. Yeah, if it crashes to 0 (however unlikely) I would be devastated. But life would go on. I'd still go to work tomorrow, still get paid my normal salary, and over time I'd build up an equivalent amount of savings again.
You don't become rich without taking risks.

Jessica's just upset that she missed the train.
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:40:28
Yeah, that's why I decided to buy exactly 21 ;) Gives me a nice even chunk of the total bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:42:46
I'm so happy that I didn't buy a house and throw all my money at it like most of my friends did. Instead I held onto my cash in a bank account, and invested in Bitcoin when I saw the time was right.
I've made more in the past couple of weeks than I do in a whole year at my job.
I tell them to invest too but they say "oh, I have no money, it's all on the mortgage".
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:11:55
It says nothing about Bitcoin on that entire page...
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:23:35
I honestly can't believe that people use these things. It would be so easy for the owner to rig it so it's balanced in their favour, and you'd never know without having source code access. A coin flip should be (almost) random, but I bet on these sites it's not.
There's a very good reason why real casinos have such strict rules and regulations.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:20:04
Would be fantastic news if it happens. 1000% growth overnight.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:59:42
Lucky you asked. I have consulted my crystal ball and it informs me that the crash will be happening on 17th December at 16:23 GMT. Therefore I highly recommend investing just after this time.
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:58:02
I think it's pretty obvious it's a joke...
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:47:30
That's awesome! I couldn't even imagine my parents touching Bitcoin with a 50 foot pole.
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:16:36
I don't know, why? Should I be donating simply based on the fact that they accept bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:38:02
I didn't panic even when it really did look like it was crashing. Anyone who's in this for the long term will become very rich. There WILL be crashes along the way.
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:43:59
Coinjar, although they're not as good as they used to be. I don't plan on buying anymore BTC for now anyway. Happy to just sit on what I've got for the next couple of years.
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:36:07
I am Australian. I own more BTC than I do AUD.
