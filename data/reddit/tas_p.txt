It's a pretty fair assumption to make that "people like you" means "you". Drop the BS. And go ahead, report me. I'm all FOR reasonable regulation. Welcome to the other side.

Ideology makes people stupid. Divorced from reality, they give off the vibe of a loon. Unhealthy individuals, I can only imagine the problems these people encounter in their relations with healthier people, their spouses or children, their coworkers.

Not classy at all (from someone who likes and uses Kraken).
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:36:38
I feel dirty just by having clicked on that link. Ugh.
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:14:08
The blame is ENTIRELY on the victim? So the scammer himself is blameless? Go fuck yourself. You're all the same.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:07:29
You're a waste. Poor comprehension, fallacious logic, moral ineptitude...

No. It's just that bitcoin will need serious development before it can go mainstream.

What an idiot that you are.
And, sorry to disappoint. I never lost a single satoshi. And I'm up x25 on my original investment (having been on this game since Nov. 2012). 
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:46:12
How about blaming both, and not just the one or the other?

I like your work. I took part in the survey last year and this year too. Good luck in getting more responses.

They're overpriced.

This is very ugly. The first iteration of the site looked like the job of a professional designer. This 'redesign' looks like the job of the owner or some coder employee who thought he could play designer. It looks terrible, amateurish (and I'm trying to be polite here). Kraken has decent btc/eur daily volume and they recently raised their fees too. They should have had enough money to hire a professional designer for any changes that needed to be made.

"Malicious intent to extract money from cryptocurrencies." That's what it boils down, doesn't it? Fear that your BTC won't be as valuable as you'd like. Of course, you're ignorant of the fact that ripple is older than bitcoin too. There were no cryptocurrencies when ripple was being developed. And since you don't want to address Satoshi's own premine, here is the link:
The "Well Deserved Fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto", estimated at 1 MILLION bitcoins. Should we then describe this as Satoshi's "malicious intent to extract money from all of us"?

Or, "Bitcoins" can be reduced to "Bits". In which case, you can have: 1B = 1,000mB (one bit is a thousand millibits).

That's possible with the ripple wallet (ripple.com). The ripple wallet can hold all sorts of currencies (crypto, fiat, or even "imaginary" ones). You can use the ripple wallet to send btc to btc addresses. And the wallet itself has integrated exchanges where you can convert one currency to another. Moreover, ripple is open source so a developer could take the code and make a wallet exactly as you describe it.

Ripple of course is not a scam. inputs.io is a colossal scam whose owner waged a massive libeling campaign against ripple. And try having some class, btw. Feeling threatened by something is by no means a license to be spreading FUD about it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:26:35
The end result is the freakin' same. It doesn't matter how you go about it. One can always argue that this was the intention all along. Keeping 1 million coins from the start is the same as mining 1 million coins when no one is around.

Second Life, in its heyday (2005-2006), was regarded as a virtual country. People flocked there to buy and develop land, create businesses or find a job, attend seminars, concerts, etc. Thousands of people lived there and made a living. And it was all facilitated by the Linden dollar, probably the first virtual currency that could legally be exchanged for fiat currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:04:59
I never said anything is a scam. But you did.

The competition is fair if everyone shares the same information and has the same equipment. Which was not the case and still isn't. I suppose you're a miner who's afflicted by the mining-is-fair syndrome. Try stepping outside of your world and seeing the big picture. Not everyone knew (or knows) about this and not everyone had (or has) the hardware and technical know-how.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:58:24
If Opencoin's premine is a scam, then by definition Satoshi's premine must be a scam too. So your initial assertion that ripple is a scam because of the premine does not stand (except if you want to admit the same for bitcoins, which I 'm sure you don't). So how about manning up and saying "Sorry, I was an idiot for saying that ripple is a scam because it is premined". Instead, you jump off to another set of idiotic accusations (closed, centralized, ponzi, etc.). GTFO.

mBTC can be pronounced 'embits' too
and uBTC can be pronounced 'youbits'
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:22:39
Most don't "think" it is a scam. They just "say" it is a scam. You know, spreading FUD in hopes that it will not succeed.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:01:31
That's exactly it. The usual, run-of-the-mill arguments are of the sort "ripple is premined, therefore it's a scam" or "Ripple Labs says ripple will be open-sourced but it's not open-sourced now and give no deadline, therefore it's a scam" (ripple has since been open-sourced). A few provide arguments that are a lot more esoteric (and I don't claim to understand them all), but those do not claim that ripple is a scam but rather that it won't work, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:42:59
Ah ok. So it is not a "colossal scam" but it "borders on scamming." Here is one thing that's certain. You're a liar. Also, how many BTC did Satoshi mine on his own (which is pretty much the same as a premine)? A million? More?
