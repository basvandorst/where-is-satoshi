But of course some think they are getting ripped off by shady free stuff. I mean, sure Robinhood has many shit policies but that doesn't mean switching to another broker and suddenly order data is not sold. People get mad because they don't understand how things are in the first place.
Just like how people keep saying RH does not allow you withdraw BTC so it is bad. Like seriously that platform is for speculators that don't give a shit about "getting one's own coin" instead of hodlers so pretty much expected. Wonder if are going to cry about how forex doesn't allow them to get "real foreign money". /s

Does that even change my point? English or not, in place with non-Christian, atheist or agnostic majority population people don't care about how you cry they are not using it in your religious way. It would make sense for them to call it CE because they recognize the fact the calendar is used worldwide, it wouldn't make sense to call the first year the year of Lord because they don't believe in the religion.

If you use limit order that is quite a red flag.

If the market does crash big time like 08 people gonna sell bitcoins because they can't HODL when starving. Long term is another story though.

I always wait for 6k. Didn't fail last two times. Not sure about this time though.

Everyone? Chinese use BCE/CE in their own language and Japanese call it Western Calendar.

It is an exaggerating claim. During the 2015-16 stock market crash the reserve decreased a lot (around 1/4) to stabilize yuan and the government sold assets for more USD reserve. They use it in urgent situation, far from manipulate it for whatever they want.

Hey nobody forces you to abandon the way you call it so don’t talk like some people call it in another way is a problem.

Shit, I just noticed this rally. Got one last month when it dropped to 8000, then it dropped further and I sort of forgot about bitcoin.
Looks like the right choice is to check out once per month.

HODLed since last year and at one point -50%. Now up 100%. Definitely not for weak hands.

Somewhere in between. I was doing the "buy at 6K-7K, sell when it goes up, rinse and repeat" strategy. It worked for 2 times then went horribly wrong. From that point, I realized there is a chance it would go to 0, But selling was a dumb move at that time so I decided to just HODL it either to nothing or to the moon. Not to mention the reasons behind the drop were not convincing(Bitcoin Cash has problem, exchange go boom, ETF denied by SEC, etc.) and felt like manipulators trying to find random reasons to hide their moves.

I won't do that because so far Bitcoin grows in a period we don't see any global economic crisis. In 4 years there is a high chance this trade war between US and China being the last straw and screws everyone up. I have no idea whether people will be forced to abandon their positions in a difficult time or use it as a safe haven.
But as long as countries are not failing left and right I don't see a problem HODLing.
