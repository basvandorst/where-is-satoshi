oh ok.  Cool.  I didnt want to just "forward" my coins and then have no idea where the heck they went and mess up the process.  This provided some clarity.  Thanks everyone.

sweet.  that worked.  thanks for the help!

Is this andreas talk accurate in that as long as you send your coins to yourself to different addresses and get more than X hops away, its impossible to prove and good to break chainanalysis from seeing a mixer or other bad things?

pretty simple, they all say cant connect in their own special way just depends on which app i am using.  all apps are connecting via local wifi so on the same subnet as my core node.  also, as i mentioned i can connect from another machine using electrum and pointing electrum to the node as i have electrum personal server running alongside my core node for connectivity via electrum.  that all works fine.  its just something with the more simple wallet apps that allow you to connect to your own node but only give you the options to put in IP address, port and some allow you to put in rpcuser and rpcpassword values.   
 My core node is setup with:
there is no firewall running on the linux node where i host my core node.  i can connect to it via ssh.  i can rdp to it, etc.

flagged for removal?  wtf?

Will this help or do anything if I have EPS configured to speak to my Core node but my Core node has the -P flag set and is running over ToR?  Is this feature only for Core nodes that arent configured to broadcast over ToR?

Yea but coins that have been mixed via Wasabi, are you finding that companies like coinbase/gemini/etc dont allow users to cash out those coins to usd?  do they flagged mixed coins and treat them different?

Thanks!  Any idea how these numbers have grown over the past 2+ years?

did you read the article?

Kleiman + CSW isnt really a theory anymore.  Read the article I posted in this thread.  The question now is, what happens when CSW gets control of the keys through the trust?  Thats what everyone should be worried about.

In mid-2011 Satoshi suddenly disappeared from view. Apart from one or two emails denouncing fake Satoshis, he wasn’t heard from again. Control of the network alert key is said to have been passed at this time to Andresen – possession of this key makes its holder the closest thing bitcoin has to a chief. Wright sent Kleiman an email on 10 September 2011: ‘It is recorded. I cannot do the Satoshi bit any more. They no longer listen. I am better as a myth. Back to my lectures and rants that everyone ignores as me. I hate this Dave, my pseudonym is more popular than I can ever hope to be.’For some reason – possibly fear of the ATO – Wright set up a trust fund called the Tulip Trust in June 2011, and asked Kleiman to sign an agreement stating that he, Kleiman, would hold 1,100,111 bitcoin (then valued at £100,000, currently worth around $800 million). For clarity: there is no evidence that Kleiman ever took custody of that amount. However, there was a separate agreement that Kleiman would receive 350,000 bitcoin and this transaction was made. ‘All bitcoin will be returned to Dr right on 1 January 2020,’ it says in the trust document.


Kleiman signed it. ‘I think you are mad and this is risky,’ he wrote in an email to Wright on 24 June 2011, perhaps spying a possible illegality. ‘But I believe in what we are trying to do.’ Wright meanwhile seemed to get more and more frustrated. He both wanted fame and repudiated it, craving the recognition he felt was his due while claiming his only wish was to get back to his desk. ‘I have people who love my secret identity and hate me,’ he wrote to Kleiman on 23 October that year. ‘I have hundreds of papers. Satoshi has one. Nothing, just one bloody paper and I cannot associate myself with ME! I am tired of all these dicks Dave. Tired of academic attacks. Tired of tax fuckwits. Tired of having to do shenanigans like moving stuff overseas IN CASE it works.’

How on earth can you be so sure about that?  
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:26:43
 Can you explain how the bitcoin proof of work change comes about?  How can you change PoW in the Bitcoin system?  Are you inferring that bitcoin could change to something other than PoW in the future?  Please elaborate on this.
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:02:22
what does that mean?

I get it but honestly if Kleiman and CSW werent extremely early miners then they were certainly very very early on in bitcoins origins.  What information source do you have that you have researched to make the claim that Kleiman couldnt have done it.  Just because he doesnt have a background doesnt mean he couldnt have been a part of a team to assemble the pieces that eventually became bitcoin.  You dont need to go to a high school, college, or advanced education to create something or do research in the information age.  
"Some of Dave's most notable work took place at S-doc where his role was Chief Information Security Officer. While there he developed a Windows encryption tool that surpassed NSA, NIST, and Microsoft Common Criteria Guidelines. This technology was used at NASA, U.S. Dept. of Treasury, Office of the Inspector General, and the US Post Office. Cryptography was routinely used at S-doc to develop several products, broadly aimed at the reliable and verifiable transmission of data and messages, centered around the idea of an "unalterable, encrypted audit log system".
Dave was also a regular contributor to Cryptography and Security mailing lists where discussions included technical aspects of cryptosystems and the politics of cryptography. Kleiman was a long-time member of the same Metzdowd Cryptography mailing list where Satoshi Nakamoto first announced Bitcoin on Oct. 31, 2008. "
Maybe he was just super early to bitcoin or maybe he and others had a part in its creation.  But i do understand - dont trust, verify.  We have no verification and it will certainly be interesting to follow the court case between CSW and Kleiman because I think we may get some interesting bits of information about the very early days of bitcoin.  I wish experts like you and the community would give a little more color or opinion on some of this stuff rather than dismissing Kleiman outright.  I would like to know what depth you and others have gone to in order to look into the bitcoin origins.  Thanks for all that you do.

I would love to read Lopp's research if and when it becomes available.

Whats wrong with running:
"subversion": "/Satoshi:0.14.1(UASF-Segwit-BIP148)/",
How is it different?  Am I not helping?

paging please enlighten me or point me in the direction of some of your research.  hopefully, jameson lopp's research may shed some light on this:
