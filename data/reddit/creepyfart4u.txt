This is really misguided. 
Business create value or they stumble and get acquired. The assets of a company are only relevant to their ability to create value. That’s what affects stock price, what value the company brings to the market.
Cryptos are a false commodity. The only value is that they need to be “mined”.   They don’t store anything of value.  You only really make money off of any delta in currencies  once it stabilizes

I think you miss the point that bitcoin is easily copied. 
The tech is proven. So adoption of bitcoin2 would be as easy as resetting all the miners equipment and pointing it to the bitcoin2 source. 
I mean a few tweaks in the code and you have a competitor to bitcoin. As bitcoin2 increases in adoption you’ll see deflation in the original bitcoin as users move to the “new” and shiny. 
Unlike gold which has a real world use case and value. Bitcoin can be easily replaced. And it will when all the coins are mined.   It may temporarily get to be more expensive. Then competition will open up new coins. 
You are totally missing the point that fiat is a monopoly and can it be replaced. While the virtual coins can be easily replaced by another virtual coin. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:22:03
So it sounds like you have problems that bitcoin couldn’t even help you with. 
As far as middle aged being ignorant that is funny.  I commented because it sounded like you didn’t understand what inflation is. Sorry I tried to cure you ignorance. Yes, not everyone does research but I do and so far Bitcoin appears as valuable as dreams.  All I hear in response as to why it is exists is FUD.
When you ask a basic question about a technology and it can’t be broken down into a simple answer, then somebody either doesn’t understand it enough themselves to explain it or they are scamming you. 
Bitcoin is mainly a technology. The value assigned to the coin is completely arbitrary. When all the bitcoins are mined what will happen?  I can only foresee everyone flocking to “Son of Bitcoin” whatever that is and driving up the value of that. There is no magic to bitcoin.  Just the “Brand recognition” Block chain can be replicated. So the value of coins will fall when the bubble finally bursts and people move on to the next big thing. 
No one has adequately explained the problem bitcoin is trying to solve. And that is the key to any technologies success. Solve a problem more efficiently until a better solution comes along. 
So far, the only problem I see bitcoin solving is possibly cheaper currency exchange. 
It won’t solve inflation, it won’t end banking, it won’t end human misery. 
If you see something else perhaps you can explain in a simple way?
Until then any bitcoins bought should only be purchased for speculation(money you can afford to lose). Don’t put your rent money into it (unless landlord requires payment in it). 
My only concern is not to see you get burned in a  bad investment my friend. It’s very easy to get excited and loose sight of the risks. But if you only play with money you can afford to lose then you may make out.

He’s also avoided massive losses from bubbles. 
You act like tech investing is a new thing. It’s just that older tech has matured so you don’t recognize the trend anymore. 
Aerospace, solid state electronics, chemicals, timesharing computers,  dot coms all went through hype, booms, and busts. 
Amazon and google are examples of survivorship bias. At the time they started they were NOT good investments. It only became obvious after they survived and dominated. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:17:20
LOL - sure, you totally missed the point. 
The “proof of work” is what will be the downfall. 
Bitcoin is not a closed system. It’s open source.  It will be easy to clone. 
All you have to do is set up an alt stream using the same tech. Not all that difficult and if bitcoin gets too expensive people will jump at the chance to get in on the ground floor of a new competition. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:27:24
LOL - what fees?  I don’t pay any fees to a bank. 
All I have to do is not be a dope and bounce a check.  Also just keep a small balance and I have not paid any fees.   And just use my banks ATMs to avoid any fees charge by other bank. 
So basically bitcoin is not a threat as only dopes that can’t balance a checkbook will use it. 
You sound ignorant if you can’t shop around and find free banking. 
Still haven’t given me a problem that bitcoin is solving.

So the best way to explain inflation is to ask you this:
Do you expect a raise in your salary this year?
Unless your an idiot I will assume yes.  And so will 99% of the people in the world. 
So what will your employer have to do in order to give you a raise?
3 ways 
1) see a rise in productivity (you do more)
2) raw materials costs decrease.
3) raises prices. 
So even if bitcoin was the “coin of the realm” prices would still have to rise.  Simply because the people in the economy will demand it. Instead of .025 and item will be .026 or .027.  You will pay these costs directly or indirectly. 
Inflation is irrespective of the underlying currency. The only way around it is if you are playing with exchange rates for underlying materials. But then there will be import fees and tariffs. 
The only other way is via current fed policy of changing interest rates to cool the economy down(costs rise for financing) 
Inflation is not always bad thing. For example in housing you buy a house in today’s dollars and pay for it with tomorrow’s inflated dollar. Making the house a cheaper purchase. 
Also, not sure how the under 40 comment is relevant.  Unless your making a point they are naive and don’t see the downsides. 
BTW-   The barrier to entry is very low. Bitcoin can be copied 100 times. (Just like any currency). If bitcoin gets too expensive, don’t you think people will flock to alternatives? 
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:26:54
I still don’t understand how bitcoin is a “Threat” to banks.  
As far as I’m aware bitcoin does not earn any interest.  And I don’t believe anyone is lending bitcoin to buy houses cars etc.  Maybe as a payment system as opposed to debit/credit cards. But those fees are a fraction of earnings. 
Banks don’t profit by holding money in a vault. They “borrow” from depositors and earn from the float between what they pay and income from loans.  If bitcoin replaces US$ or € then banks will just modify systems to support that. Instead of buying a car for 30K US. They just loan you 5 bitcoin and still charge interest.  
Such a childish comment.  All you are doing is changing who’s names is on the fees you pay for a transaction. 
Anyway you also forget that Bill Gates at least recognized several changes in tech and rose to meet them. 
GUI’s - Windows after crushing the market with DOS. Apple copied from Xerox first but was beat so badly by MS a cash influx from MS is the only thing that kept them going. Jobs owes his place in history partly to Bill Gates. 
Networking - when companies started networking PCs and servers he came out with Windows server and that ecosystemKilled Novell and a bunch of other network companies that had 90% penetration. 
Internet - originally windows has no IP stack. He realized and corrected. Pivoted development to the internet. 
Browser - IE wasn’t on Windows originally. Netscape (now Mozilla/Firefox) had 90% of the market. He fought that back and won for years. 
Cloud - kind of after him but MS is kicking butt in cloud deployments. 
So while I don’t like Bill Gates or his business practices, he recognizes game changing moves in technology and combats them.  He’s a smart guy and it’s pretty stupid to discount him.

Your premise make no sense. 
If inflation is caused by issuing more money, then what happens when a new “coin” is mined?  Inflation if your premise is correct. 
If we’ve mined all the bitcoin then inflation will be caused by scarcity. 
So bitcoin doesn’t seem to counteract inflation.

Once again they demonstrate these claims are mere nonsense.  Fools chasing fools gold. Just like gold bugs claim that gold is the ultimate store of value, both are delusional. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:58:41
Dude, I hate to break it to you, I’m not a kid. I have over a Million in the market. So I know quite a bit about money. 
I think you’re probably a neck beard in mommas basement. 
So you listed the only utility to bitcoin that I see ease of transferring money to another currency.  There is not enough need for that service to justify the average person holding money in bitcoin.  
Maybe if I did a lot of currency exchange or was trying to play the currency markets I could see value in it. 
I see you know enough to know a retailer pays a fee for a card. But I don’t see you mention that bitcoin will automatically cause the retailer to give a discount for paying in bitcoin(?). I mean they should be Saving 1 to 2 % of the sale right?  Why don’t they give discounts like they do for cash(fiat?). Don’t you get hit with fees for exchanging out of bitcoin?  Won’t this fees eat up capital if you need cash?
It’s honestly a joke to say it will kill the banking industry. You’ll still need someone to make loans. If they don’t make money from fees anymore they will just increase interest rates and money/bitcoin will cost more to borrow.  Bitcoin won’t magically make everyone rich.  People will still need credit more then they do retail banking. Retail banking is already a declining business. 
Buffet and Gates are just trying to pass on wisdom. And idiots keep denying that truth. Even if 50 % of the world moves to bitcoin( which will never happen) those 2 will still be among the richest men.  
Slow and steady wins the race my friend, invest wisely not foolishly in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 10:01:51
Who had one big winner?  Buffet?  Are you nuts? Buffet started buying stocks when he was 11 years old.  Not sure about Munger. 
Did he have some losses? Of course, that’s how you learn to stay away from scams like bitcoin. 
If your talking about Bill Gates maybe.  But even then not sure what losses your talking about? 
Early on his main payment was stock. So he was doubling down on MS which was quite a bit of risk taking . In the early years he was taking only 250K for a salary. Not Millions like most CEOs today.  The balance of his pay was company stock.

The words that cloud my judgement are when I ask one simple question, I get the sound of crickets. 
What utility does bitcoin offer?   
I have never gotten an answer that isn’t already covered by fiat.  Also unlike gold, diamonds etc it has no utility for use. Gold is used in electronics, diamonds are decorative and has industrial uses. Etc.  those “stores of value” also have practical uses. 
Bitcoin zilch.  I mean I get a lot of meaningless noise, and called names because I point out everything a coiner  mentions is already done better and more efficiently by existing methods. 
The only thing bitcoin does is open up a vector for scams and illegal activity. In the meantime it destroys the environment because of the intensive use of electricity for miners.  
By the way we’ve seen bitcoin before. It’s called a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:53:48
None of those examples are unique to bitcoin. 
So you’ve failed.
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:40:05
I was looking for a utility unique to Bitcoin. 
There is none. 
Therefore no NEED for bitcoin. 
And if all things were equal and it wasn’t an environmental disaster. It would still be a scam.
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:15:24
So we agree that bitcoin offers no unique utility?  Because if we agree on that you are at least being reasonable. 
So, let’s say we agree....
If Bitcoin offers no unique utility, there is no compelling reason it should be used over and above any of the other existing options.  
For no other reason then inertia, why would I invest in new tools to store wallets and waste time in setting up accounts on exchanges?  I get 0 benefit over and above current ways of doing things.  I have banking, credit, and savings/brokerage accounts already. 
I have no plans to participate in illegal activity so, I have no need to use Bitcoin in an attempt to skirt the authorities. 
Actually as a “Store of value” I am doing worse, because I could simply buy a gold coin and store it in my desk drawer. I’ll always have it handy. And even if the power goes out, I can pull my gold coin out of my desk drawer and use it to exchange for food.  
If you yell I should buy it simply because “It’s the future!”, then I have some Pets.com stock and Netscape shares from before the Dot.com crash for you.  people were just as blind to investing in stocks that were losing money as Bitcoiners are today in their search for digital gold. 
It’s a ponzi scam, get out while you can.

LOL- of course, this is the standard delusional Bitcoin excuse.
The script goes like this:
Babble a bunch of nonsense about how bitcoin is unique. Usually in terms that indicate they don’t understand how it’s a Ponzi scheme. 
When questioned about specifics, gaslight and highlight some other use case that has already been done and due to existing infrastructure is cheaper. 
When that is pointed out, you gas light again and claim the non-coiner is ignorant or has an ax to grind (why?). 
I’m no kid, I am in the tech space so understand the technobabble and  there is no logic to any of it.  There is nothing “magic” about block chain that solves a problem that a database can’t do more cheaply and using less energy.  There is no use case that a “Bitcoin” solves that isn’t already done with currency. 
You have no time to educate me because YOU yourself have no idea what you are talking about!

Oh boy.  
So if I hand someone a $100.00 bill how can that be traced back to me?  You’re being an idiot. 
Even if is send it via the postal service I can use a dummy return address or a blind drop( 3rd party post box)  drop it in a random post box and guess what recipient has a nice crisp $100.00 bill in his hand!  Complete anonymity achieved!
The keys and transactions can be traced back to you. Unless you are using an highly secure VPN via multiple countries all IP traffic can be traced. Someone just needs to monitor the network. (NSA, CIA, FBI) Or are you so naive as to believe the Internet is truly “free”. 
The hassle of setting up that VPN network means that anonymity is not really a selling point unless your up to shady shit. 
Why the fascination with my “money” being untraceable?  If I transact any sum above a few hundred I want ensure there is proof my money got to the right person/entity. 
The only reason for anonymity is if I am doing something illegal.  
Current currency is decentralized. In no way shape or form do I have to wait for my transactions to be approved by anyone other then me.  I walk up to McDonalds and drop a $20 on the counter. Nobody knows I was sneaking a Big Mac on the sly.  Nobody had to approve my transaction by checking a big database.  Julio just had to touch a button so Javier would be informed he needed to make my burger. 
You are being willfully stupid here. Or are you simply pulling my leg for some comedy gold?
I hope YOU learned something. 
Or are you simply a neckbeard residing in granny’s basement?  I mean how else can you not know how currency transactions work.  These are really stupid reasons to prop up a Ponzi scheme. If you can’t see this you must just be hoping a bigger dummy buys enough to bring you to zero so you can get out.

LOL-  I can transfer cash around the world with a click of the button. Quicker and cheaper then a blockchain transaction. 
Anonymous transactions?  I thought the benefit of blockchain was that the record books were “open” and everyone knows about the transactions?  Can’t have it both ways. 
Decentralized? So are you saying I have to ask before I can transfer a dollar or a Gold coin to a vendor, friend or neighbor?  You know that’s not true. I ask no one!  I just do it. I drop my coin or bill in their hand with zero effort. With a credit card. Stalemate I don’t even need to spend my coin. I spend Visa’s. 
With your shill-coin I have to go to the network, and wait for agreement that my coin is transferred in the meantime I have to hope my wallet isn’t hacked or my exchange is shit down. 
But, sure it’s decentralized Ha-ha.  
You really have no idea what you are talking about and are just spouting the BS some scammer told you!  
The weird thing is no matter how many of you think Bitcoin is better then real money, you always benchmark against real money. Did you ever think why?  If your “Decentralized” shill money was so important, nobody would care about its value in fiat.  In Fact you would crow about how it’s stable and your gallon of milk is the same in bitcoin as it was a year ago. 
Please get your money out before the next crash. Maybe then you can escape grandmas basement and become an adult.

The scam called blockchain will hopefully be exposed, and it will never rise to those heights. 
Also, you all forget about the coins still being held by whales. Every time it rises they simply flood the market with for coins to trade to fiat.

This sounds like they are “mirroring” US reporting laws. In the US Cash transfers of over $10,000 cash are tracked via a form that is forwarded to the IRS.
It’s meant to prevent drug transactions or other fraud avoiding paying taxes on large amounts. 
Not sure if that is a law in the UK like the US.  Or it may be a terrorism related regulation because they are trying to limit cash to ISIS.
So a transfer from bitcoin to cash might result in the same BS.
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:18:41
That to prevent fraud.  I bet he did not normally use that bank and went to the check writers bank. 
If that check was faked they would have no recourse to recover it. If your friend went and deposited it in his bank he would have had no problem. It would have cleared in a day or 2.

@_date: 2018-02-03 15:01:04
While I don’t disagree with your premise these rules are in place to prevent them from making mistakes. 
Humans do not properly asses risk. Sometimes small risks actually appear to be major and big risks are discounted. 
So because a lot of people lost a lot of money doing pre-IPO investing rules are in place to TRY and ensure you understand risk. 
Bernie Madoff is an recent example.
He was posting gains that were impossible to achieve, and a lot of qualified investors stayed away.  But he managed to find enough “qualified” investors that either didn’t do due diligence or were greedy and just saw gains. These people some of them lost on the level of millions. 
Because his investments were “private” there wasn’t much regulatory scrutiny.  This allowed him to fly under the radar and keep the scam going for years. 
Also think about how many crowdfunding projects never take off. I’ve seen a few lawsuits over products that never get made or are made poorly. 
Obviously not all Pre-IPO opportunities are bad. But for the ones that fail too many people lost too much money so the government added the regulations to prevent or minimize the hurt when they do fail.

Does bitcoin transfer some magic power to allow me to spend my money quicker?

I think one of the issues with crypto is all the FUD spread by the promotors even more so then the detractors. 
Is it an investment, or is it a replacement for fiat currency?
If it’s a replacement for currency, then it needs to be somewhat stable as people can’t pay their mortgage with a wildly fluctuating currency. It makes life for the average person too complicated and will hurt adoption. 
And if it’s stable there won’t be much upside.  Growth will have to be managed to help with adoption. 
If it’s an “investment” as you seem to promote.   Then you need to analyze downside risks and you will have both speculators and “Investors” like any stock or commodity. You actually need both to drive price movements. 
Telling people to only HODL won’t have any impact because if everyone is using it as a investment, then you need buyers and sellers to drive prices up and down.  That’s how people in the market make money. 
Also if it’s an “investment” it’s not realistic to predict it will always rise. Just like stocks, the next big thing will come along and probably gut the price
Of the tech. 
But good luck.

Why are you guys so hung up on a fed audit?  An audit by who?
Remember Arthur Anderson?  They audited Enron. It Didn’t do anybody any good they still went bankrupt. 
As far as printing money goes all someone has to do is stand up a Bitcoin II.  Immediately double the number of “fake fiat” circulating. There are already a ton of alt coins. If you don’t see the stupidity of that statement about printing money you can’t be helped.

How are they different?  
Imaginary coins are ALL imaginary. There is no value in holding any crypto. There is NO utility,  it’s all “credits” in a ledger that cannot be retrieved if stolen. 
I ask constantly what is the use case for crypto’s and nobody can define it except for tin-foil hat theories about the Fed being bad. 
Bolivars and $ are backed by their respective governments. Crypto is backed by nothing, except the greater fool theory.  US$ derives it’s value partially through our governments ability to pay and enforce our economic might. The Bolivar is an example of a failing socialist regime that relied on oil(which is falling in value) to prop up its regime.

You are confused. 
People who have sold have “locked in” their loss. Just those that continued to HODL at the height did not truly realize that gain. It disappeared. 
But, people who HODL that bought at a higher price, have lost as well. They just haven’t locked it in. And there is potential for continued loss as much as there is for gain.

Yes, I know how it works. 
It’s a scam. Once you learn that you’ll be out.

But Bitcoin doesn’t offer anything.  It’s like jack and the beanstalk. Magic beans.

Not when they are trying to save regular citizens from the bitcoin scam. 
The bitcoin shills promoting it to everyone is what will cause regulation. If people weren’t losing hard earned money on this “investment” the government would ignore it.

LOL - No matter how you personally feel about the protection,there will always be people that lose in markets and go mewling to the govt for “help”. And then ask why it wasn’t prevented. That’s where regulation comes in. 
Look at the Bernie Madoff if he had never been caught nobody would have bitched.  I bet the majority of his initial investors would have sworn there was no need to regulators Bernie. Of course after their I’ll gotten gains were clawed back they were in happy.
