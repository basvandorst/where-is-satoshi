But if miners accept stolen coins as fees, wouldn't they be commiting a crime according to traditional law enforcement?
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:14:02
For those saying BitGo is not to blame here, I agree they are not responsible for the distribution of inputs in the wallet. Yet, including inputs that cost more in fees than they add to the final amount, that is just bad UX. At least warn the user that they are "burning" their money and paying for it. CoPay does this well, you can then lower your fee level to a lower confirmation time and/or wait for better network conditions before sending your tx.

How pedantic can you be? We all got what he meant.
@_date: 2016-04-11 21:18:16
Thank you for the thorough response. I still would never recommend Coinbase as a wallet for the loss of privacy.
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:40:15
But doesn't this strongly reduces the overall security by making your login credentials the only piece of information that unlocks your coins? What is the point of being super secure using multi-sig if your funds depend on a password you repeatedly type on many devices? Or am I missing something?

This guy represents a new breed of hypocrite and sociopathic politicians. A cryptopolitician if you will...

That is a straw-man. Bitcoin doesn't need to be a replacement for VISA. It just needs to be as big as it can be without losing decentralization. Today that threshold is much higher than 1MB.
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:50:12
I am referring to Bitcoin's throughput. There is an acceptable threshold of what we can consider acceptable, as fuzzy and as dynamic as it may be. I don't think 1MB is even in the same order of magnitude of such value.

I know this is meant to be a joke but it is very missleading. If Classic wins, his coins will be as valid as yours so he will be able to pay you.
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:31:40
They have been told that with LN the few transactions fitting in small blocks will pay huge fees. This may be true in theory. The problem for me is if people leave Bitcoin because it is unusable, they are not coming back once LN is released. They will already be using some other coin.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:31:29
I'm not saying you are but checking the sequence number on the tx is not enough. You also need to perform the check on the entire unconfirmed input tree.
@_date: 2016-01-29 13:07:31
This is a straw-man. I want Bitcoin to handle as many transactions as it can, no more, no less. The optimum throughput of the network should be determined by Nakamoto consensus. Devs should be providing alternatives, not forcing them.

Yes. Only for new wallets though.

You can do something about it, [help translate Copay](

Can't restore what wasn't there to begin with...
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:53:08
You fail to realize the implications of coinbase coins being worth more. It is not a "minor numismatic difference". Guess what, it's not collectors that are paying the premium. It means coins with a history are or risk being tainted. It means "I want a newly minted coin because used coins could have been used for bad stuff/by bad guys and they may be worth less if LE gets interested in them". If that doesn't convince you that Bitcoin is not fungible I don't know what will.
@_date: 2016-09-17 13:57:32
Evidence doesn't matter. The fact that this can be done at any time is what matters.
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:54:39
What is so hard to understand? If one coin's history is different from another coin's history and *I can tell them appart* then there is no fungibility.
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:33:01
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:58:18


This is not significant enough to destroy cash fungibility.
@_date: 2016-09-18 16:48:28
Nobody cares for that kind of lack of fungibility. It is the same with Bitcoin, if I have 1 coin in cold storage and 1 coin in my mobile wallet, I would much rather pay with my hot wallet. What does it matter? We are talking about making the decision based on where the coin has been, what kinds of goods it has been used to pay for, etc. Those things affect fungibility in a much more serious way than your example.
@_date: 2016-09-17 21:49:09
You would be interested to know that freshly mined coins sell for up to 10% premium. I expect it to be worse in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:31:38
Right. Also the options had some ad antiquitatem fallacy bullshit making it a really skewed poll.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:25:19
This is not a presidential election. Most people do not understand the technicalities of a fork and do not have an opinion on the matter and yet they are invested in BTC. This is de definition of "vocal minority".
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:51:40
Just to give you an example. On the facebook group from argentina, only 270 out of 21k users participated on the poll to oppose s2x.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:48:16
Only 270 out of 21k people participated in that poll.
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:55:18


@_date: 2017-10-18 13:02:53
1% is not a big enough sample. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:29:34
Since it was a voluntary poll on a forum run by Core supporters, it is very skewed. It is unethical to present this as representing the whole community. But I think the main issue here is the lack of interest on technical matters in the community. In the end, any poll will have a low representation because the community doesn't really care about the outcome.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:09:23
would you rather see bitpay disappear? i'm glad they finally came to their senses. hope it's not too late for them.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:01:50
All admins of that group are Core supporters. Anyone voicing a dissenting opinion is attacked. Granted, they do not remove posts which I'm grateful for. But still, it had its effect on the participation.

Which LN is not...
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:39:40
So, this means I can use my 12 words from mycelium with copay right? How would I go about doing that?
@_date: 2015-10-17 17:43:16
source? are there any reported issues regarding this?
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:17:59
why buttcoin? he is a bitcoin hero.
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:16:02
99% of all bitcoins will be mined 20 years from now.
