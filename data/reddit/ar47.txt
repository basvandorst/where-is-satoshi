When you buy on Coinbase, you lock in the price.  I dropped $200 last week and got $300 by the time it cleared.

I guess i just don't want to take it to the extreme like the users of that subreddit.  I *could* retire at 40 if I wanted to live like a hermit.  But I'd rather buy some nice shit and retire in my late 50's.  Either way, I use the investing advice found in that subreddit.

Okay let's be a bit more optimistic.  Let's say the world GDP is doubled and half of all Bitcoins are missing.  $10,000,000 / BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:02:35
is awesome.  Not because I want to retire at 40, but because they have tons of really good advice to help me live a frivilous life.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:36:30
Congratulations!  You've broke the world economy.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:01:28
Okay so maybe not totally frivilous.  I use their advice to save money for retirement and cut out shit I don't need, but I also use the advice to budget expensive things that a lot of people would call frivilous.

The issue is that there is only a finite amount of value Bitcoin can hold.  Let's assume best-case scenario that Bitcoin replaces all money in the world.  That means Bitcoin could reach like $4,000,000.  So yeah *maybe* everyone in this sub can still be considered an early adopter.  But the days of buying $100 worth of Bitcoin and becoming a billionaire are long gone.

You can't pedict what bitcoin will do.  Exponential growth doesn't sustain itself.  Not in the real world and not with bitcoin.  There's always a ceiling.

I'm gonna guess that guy used to mine back in like 2011.  People pulled in hundreds of coins a week using 5870 rigs.

I'm new to the crypto-currency scene.  Can someone explain to me how I can turn currency like Litecoins or Dogecoins into Bitcoins, then turn Bitcoins into money without getting scammed?

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.
An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.
I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
Soon I shall become richer than you can ever imagine.

I remember some guy who had 24 5870s going and said he was making thousands each month.  BTC was only a couple bucks back then so it's safe to say hardcore miners pulled in thousands of coins each month.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:32:25
I would if I could.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:04:49
Ask him for some if his Bitcoins if he doesn't want them.

Let's see a month-to-month graph now.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:42:14
God dammit this story makes me wish I had mined more back in 2009.  I remember thinking it wasn't worth it because I could only make about $1 per day.  That one dollar per day was when bitcoins were only worth around one dollar...
If I had mined more, I wouldn't have needed to pay for college.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:33:15
I'm with you.  I was 16 and still relying on my parents when I first heard.  I tried mining with my GPU but thought making one coin per day by mining wasn't worth it.
Yeah I regret that, but I started buying yesterday and plan to make it to the top.  My goal is to have 1 BTC by Christmas.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:03:08
It doesn't matter unless you convince yourself it matters.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:16:34
I always find myself wondering how high Bitcoin could go.  $100,000 is definitely possible, but $1M would be a lot.  That would be a market cap in tens of trillions.  I'd love to see it, but I don't know if I can believe it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:12:22
God damn I hope so.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:29:25
I agree.  It's one thing to increase 50% in a couple of months.  It's another thing to double in 4 weeks.  At a certain point the growth is unsustainable and really just a speculative bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:21:16
Bitcoin is a big Ponzi scheme with no one running it.
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:46:51
I bought when it was at $4800.  I figured it would go up *a little* before plummeting. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:20:34
Or sell now, then buy after the correction.  I know everyone here is dedicated to the HODL.  But I'm selfish and will wait for prices to stabilize/climb again.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:30:28
Buy high, sell low, buy lower.  As long as I buy for less than I sold, I'm in the clear.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:13:06
In 2009?  Bitcoin was basically only mined by Satoshi back then.

I want more buying power and will use whatever means I can to get there.  Bitcoin is convenient and could likely be the future, but for now I just want to make money off it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:35:34
It's pretty much just a hobby for me since I don't have large amounts of money to put into risky investments.  Like I literally look at money lost on Bitcoin the same as money lost on gambling. 
When the price starts to climb again I'll dump a decent amount of money in, like I want at least 2 Bitcoins, but right now is not a buyers market.
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:19:48
Exactly why I bought.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:49:20
6 years ago I started mining with my 6870 and decided 1.5 BTC per day wasn't worth the money.

Your post history seems to check out.  Have you had any luck cashing out in the last three years?
You should really do an AMA, also.

It was at $3100 when I posted that comment.  I'm cautious about this current climb, but watching to see what happens.

I bought at $4600 and sold at $3900.  I don't regret selling one bit while this shit hits the fan. 
Of course I also didn't invest a whole Bitcoin let alone 14.
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:20:21
I'm guilty.  I made a Coinbase account a couple years ago and never linked a bank account to it.  In all fairness I would have bought years ago if I had the money.

@_date: 2017-09-01 14:15:28
$100k is doable.  $10,000 is inevitable.  $30,000-$50,000 is pretty likely to be honest.
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:43:49
I'd have cashed out much slower.  Like half back during the first 2013 explosion, half of what remained in the second 2013 explosion, half now, etc.  
Wait.  Maybe this guy didn't sell *all* his Bitcoins.  Maybe this is just a small chunk of his money.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:47:09
Yeah it's safe to say a huge amount of the world's transactions aren't in the thousands of dollars.

The 5870 came out in 2009.  He could have been mining for quite some time.  In 2010 BTC was worth less than $0.10.  Of course it was worth well over $1 by August of 2011 so while I can understand how he could have mined all the Bitcoin, I don't see why he would gave it all away.
