You can't spend your fiat either, because you could've bought bitcoin with it, so you are losing out either way.

Realmoney gambling/betting is not allowed in the official appstores. So it will never go viral on mobile. Maybe a good idea for a website but sounds like a lot of legal hussle if you want to earn money from betting/gambling.

70:30 he is satoshi. And a good actor. Considering his work background (he must be smart and very tech-savvy) and a reporter harrassed him weeks ago i'm sure he would have researched what bitcoin actually is. Free lunch, bitcom, bitcoin company, i don't buy it.

No. The speed of internet connections is advertised in kilobit. Not bit. So people would be confused eiter way. Milibit? Kilobit? It's all data right? Yes i think we could easily establish Bitcoin bits. There is barely any context overlap. Bits already have different meanings in computer science (bits: unit for messurement of entropy (a real number not a binary one) - which is far worse in terms of context). People really don't care.

If you think the Bitcoin community will adopt a random unique word from a random redditor you are delusional. It's either milli/micro bits or just bits. Just bits is better for mainstream adoption so it's our best choice.

I don't think confusion matters. What matters is that it's the best sounding word (a bitcoin is made of bits, right?). Bits are well known but the term is not used often by non computer scientists.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:27:15
And while you are in the bank you can rob the bank too! Sounds way easier than to rob a lonely old japanese man in his unprotected home.

You are really easy to confuse. Just to clarify: do you mean a binary digit  money  or the unit for entropy where a bit can be any real number? 
@_date: 2014-05-03 14:55:37
No. No made up unique name by the community will get widespread consensus (unless it comes from satoshi etc). The only viable choices are microbits and bits. Imho bits will win because it's more mainstream friendly and sounds better. Confusion isn't really a problem because context.

Good bot. I don't support BCH or even bigger blocks that much but got comments removed in the past. Many people don't believe this sub is cens*red because they don't even know their comments get deleted. You need to log out to even see it.

Yes, people who didn't do their research will be in for a surprise. I absolutely believe bitcoin is the future but i see a high chance for a 60%+ crash depending on how high the price gets and quality of the next crash triggering event.
But as always that's just a good opportunity to accumulate.

Why is Facebook worth billions but any idiot can create a social media site with the same tech or even better looking / without tons of ads? Network effect.
0 is not impossible, as already said no one knows where the endgame is. I just see $500k far more likely than $0. Every investment has a chance to go to 0. It's the probability/risk-reward we care about.

Cryptocurrency is completely new technology. Why do you want to put a label on it? People use it as a currency, other people buy it just as an investment. Some people do both.


I don't think that's true at all, there are a lot of people investing and trading currencies.


That's where we have to agree to disagree, because i think not even 5% of value is in crypto because of the currency aspect. 
The currency aspect is fine, i like it, i hope Bitcoin will be usable as a currency with layer2. But from an investment perspective, currently, the currency aspect is not important. 


Cryptos are 95%+ speculation. Currently no crypto can even scale to mainstream currency use while staying decentralized. The tech is just not there yet. They will follow a bubble and crash cycle like they always did since 2009. This is still the early days, maybe in 10-20 years you will have a stable crypto useable as a currency and your currency arguments may have more importance.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:13:15

You don't really have Bitcoins on Coinbase. They have the Bitcoins and you have an IOU for Bitcoins but not for other coins. I think they will let you cash out both coins though. For example the recent Bitcoin Cash fork coins will be released in early 2018 to customers afaik. So it's all up to Coinbase.
For your personal wallet it depends on the situation after the fork:
Does 2X win and the old chain dies? 2X will be called Bitcoin, the wallet clients will update to 2X, you have to do nothing. Your old chain coins are worthless so you don't need to access them.
Does the old chain win and the 2X chain dies? Exactly the opposite.
If both chains survive it gets hairy, in that case Electrum will probably release a client (or integrate support) for the 2X chain as you need an extra 2X wallet to access your 2X coins. But if that happens you really need to do research, especially 2X not implementing replay protection could mean coin splitting will be extremely complicated.

Check the ledger website. I think apps confirm your firmware integrity.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:35:29


The fork practically copies the network history and therefore your coins into another network. If you had Bitcoins pre fork you will have Bitcoins and 2X coins after the fork.




That's not 100% certain yet. The probability only one chain survives is pretty high. But since you have coins on both chains you don't need to do anything, you follow both chains automatically. If both chains survive you have to split your coins eventually when you want to move them.


Yes, of course. But remember you won't have both coins automatically if you buy after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:08:17
No one knows, people asking this nonstop since it hit $2000. I bet on Bitcoins success. $500k+ endgame is not impossible.

Uncomfortable truth: 24h average block size is 1.04MB. No one is using it. So it actually didn't increase the blocksize at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:14:43
I hope you are wrong but i'm afraid you are right. 
I think it depends on the bubble burst trigger event on how low it will go. Gox was pretty bad. I hope for a moderate 60%-70% drop and only a few months bear market. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:19:54

In the far future many many new things will be in place to prevent lost wallets and keys. So it will be only extremely slightly deflationary in 2140 once all Bitcoins are mined. The lost keys rate will probably be so low i wouldn't even call it deflationary. Just stable.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:01:07
Following since $300, not buying in and still scared? Sorry, but i think Bitcoin is not the right investment for you. You will probably panic sell at a loss. If you followed since $300 it should be obvious to you the next (temporary) crash is just around the corner. Maybe test the waters with $500-$1000 and invest more after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:54:03
Selling before 2020/2021 is extremely stupid, selling after is just normal level  stupid. 
Because I expect at least another 10x by 2020. But that also means the market cap gets pretty high. After that another 10x+ will be more and more difficult to achieve. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:32:28
Bitcoin is not heavily deflationary. Only lost coins will make it slightly deflationary in many many years. 
Currently it's still inflationary. The price rise is because of adoption.
