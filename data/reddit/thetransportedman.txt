Its not that it's used everywhere or that everyone's heard the phrase bitcoin. It's that it can be used most everywhere that makes it a success. If pics like "this obscure location takes bitcoin!" are still hitting the front page, it is not even close to a success yet

Isn't this just passing the buck saying profits potentially earned are then your definition of success? Sure it helped people with a get quick rich scheme but that was never its purpose or intention. A digital fungible commodity money in mainstream use with the entire world would be a true success

Does 4x your current BTC investment really make you rich?

That's still small liquidity though. People complain about volatility but it's always ping ponging about $1k of values which makes for easy quick trading too

But most alt coins trend with BTC prices :|

Trump isn't a fan of the Fed and therefore Powell right now. That is all. The news could have shown Powell saying he likes omelettes in the morning and the master in queef would have said omelettes are lame and for sissies

I day trade it and get a good feel for dips and rises. I'm not looking at charts or predictions and have made a few hundred bucks the last couple months *shrug

Smuggling became the norm ie improved concealment. Sure it wouldn't decrease crypto side and but I'd bet a more private coin like XMR would take hold as the new crypto mainstream coin. BTC is only winning the race because it was first and has the most mainstream recognition at the moment.
