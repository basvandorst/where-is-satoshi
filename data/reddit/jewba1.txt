I think I saw recently that Andreas was going to be on.  Possibly related to his new book.

Yea I have the same experience.  Ponzi scheme gets thrown out a lot.

Any Joe Rogan listener knows all about Haber.  Its pretty much a meme at this point.

The more I hear Andreas speak, the more I understand about bitcoin.  He really seems to understand all aspects of Bitcoin at a fundimental level.

What in the hell...  
I'm pretty sure his business or whatever he was pumping there at the end has a direct influence on how he thinks of his competit... I mean Bitcoin.
