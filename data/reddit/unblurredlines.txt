Yes, "BTC is in a shitty place" means BTC is good. A+ for reading comprehension.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:35:40
Now that's a shitty investment.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:01:43
But you just said there aren't any transaction fees? Just because you don't directly see them doesn't mean they're not there.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:24:20
That's entirely true, and BTC is in a shitty place with fees at the moment. But the claim was that fiat doesn't have any such fees which is wrong.

That guy is a dumbfuck. It's about as clever as taking out a 75k mortgage and putting it all on red.

Altcoins are eating the fall too atm. We'll see where it all ends up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:03:02
Very true, I cashed out most of my BTC earlier and could've made more money cashing it out last week. Or I could've held it til today and cried. Or maybe tomorrow it's back up. 
Key point being: You've made 0 profit until you've realized it and one should do so regularly, like you said.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:06:58
What he's saying is his old wallet he found is still profit and that is all he's in for.

I assumed they were like pretty much all other cars. You're saying McLaren cars deviate from that and are in fact an appreciative asset?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:04:43
What you're saying is, double again soon?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:23:42
Indeed, most of the people who got in back then (I got in a bit later than that myself) got in because it was a cool concept and out of interest, not because they saw a $10000 value in the near future.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:22:33


You did. You laughed at me back then fucker. WELL WHO IS LAUGHING NOW!?!?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:28:10
Let's be real here, a McLaren is a really expensive toy that loses a huge chunk of it's value the second you bought it. Whoever bought it was probably well aware of this and even after the BTC drop today the car is going to be worth less right now than the coin is.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:29:30
Better HODL that scotch in case btc drops too far.
@_date: 2018-06-03 22:42:48
I'm thinking you're the guy with a comprehension issue, the guy you responded to was agreeing with you ;)
He was saying dropouthustler is probably an american who has never dealt with the intricacies of the travelling people before, and is also probably unaware that most europeans can give a pretty good guess at where another european is likely to be from.

Do you mean... &lt;?
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:53:09
You have to differentiate between what people will tolerate over a longer period of time and what they'll accept short term. If you want mainstream adaptation of something as technically complicated as BTC then it needs to be at similar levels of transaction efficiency as other solutions that are already in place and are known (or believed) to be reliable by the general public.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:42:49
The real question of course is, when is WeedCoin coming out?
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:42:20
I GPU mined in your pool many years ago. Like others I'm glad to see you're still going strong and I hope you're doing well!
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:27:01
So you're saying that deflation and no incentives to invest is actually bad for the economy?

Didn't they rip off their name from Sherdog or some shit like that too? Bodog Fights was a thing for a while wasn't it?

My physical wallet handles 0.3 transactions per day and isn't congested at all! Clearly going back to non-digital fiat is the way forward! Maybe B(i)tch manages better because it's much smaller scale right now?
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:14:31
That's true. But let's say we have 20% in the hands of one top dog,  being close behind at 18% and  having 15%. Now you have a controlling stake in the hands of a very small group of people. Oligarchies aren't usually the best for anyone but those at the top.

I'm not entirely in on the power structures behind each pool but afaik there's a small team managing each pool. Miners can obviously move on but it's hard to find a pool that pays off the same, has same uptime etc. There's definitely a fair bit of power to being an established pool. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:33:27
"We've already established intent, it's in the damn name!"

Don't think I am, read 2 threads and replied at a few spots in them, didn't really pay any attention to the usernames.
The you wasn't used in the sense of you personally, but as the fictional person in the current sentence. It belongs to the first sentence which, while you may choose to read it that way, didn't mean that u/celesti0n is a financial criminal.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:11:08
It doesn't. But any human system is flawed in that sense. Do you think Trump is the president because he was the best bet for humanity?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:34:54
Assuming his investment was $3750 and BTC was ~$300 per coin, he got 12,5 coins. That's 130k dollars in current value. If I were him I'd probably pull some of it out of BTC now to ensure that the investment pays off. I don't know how far off college is for his daughters but the wise thing to do is probably spread that risk as I imagine the bitcoin at this point is a rather large part of his financial holdings.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:08:44
The problem is that being an ex-convict, especially for financial crimes, will and should make people less likely to trust you with their money. Then you've established the precedent that you're not trustworthy. Just like you wouldn't want convicted childmolesters running your local day-care.

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:59
I still think diversifying one's assets is a far better course than a stop loss if you want to reduce risk in BTC after already making a killing. There is a risk of congestion meaning the value can drop very far after triggering your stop loss but before your sell order actually comes through.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:51:41
Might be different where you live but people here have managed to have 5000W ganja farms without getting kicked out, I doubt 1-2 mining rigs pulling 1kW tops would be cause for that much concern.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:04:13
Wasn't it a bad implementation of stop loss that burned a lot of etherum traders earlier this year?
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:10:47
So many people talking about it and so many different solutions being offered but nothing we can all get behind yet.

Depends on how you're handling your cashouts. I got a 2x gtx1080 rig running back in early June, I sold at some relatively unopportune times but will be hitting breakeven before the end of the year, I could've hit breakeven about a month ago if I hadn't fudged up with a weeklong downtime (power outage day after I went on vacation) and held all the payouts. 
This is also breakeven as in having taken as much fiat out of it as I put in at the beginning. Fiat+rig value is a good 170% of initial investment already. I should also mention that my initial intent was simply to subsidize higher end gaming gear than I could otherwise motivate purchasing. If mining wasn't part of the plan I'd probably be sitting with a single GTX 1060 at the moment.
Basically your ROI could be in 1 month, 3 months, a year, or if you're unlucky and everything goes to shit, never.

Hey at least somethings happening in BTC, unlike my menial shit job where I've been wasting the last hour doing nothing. At least I have reddit to pass the time.

Not from the states but used their wages as comparison. More than 70% of the US earns below 50k per year. $30 per hour is ~50k. Mind you, that's before tax, not after.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:40:28
Imagine if you bought bitcoin with that 40k 5 years ago and skipped college! Self made millionaire!

Pretty sure you're already on to it in that it sounds similar. Most people are significantly less capable of handling the written form of their language than the spoken form, notwithstanding the fact that writing allows a lot more scrutiny of what is expressed than speaking does.

Recoverability and provability I guess. I'm sure many a wife may have heard ramblings about how valuable the bitcoin is, but how likely is she to know which wallet they're in, how would the court know? It's the equivalent of a wife saying "oh he totally has 10 million dollars in gold bars and cash buried somewhere in the yard, I just don't know where".

It's the police's job to detain a suspect, it's a prosecutor's job to build a case against said suspect. Generally speaking, trying to plead your case in something as high tension (risk for instant repercussion to the reporting part) as DV to the responding officer isn't going to work. They come there and remove one party (usually the male, because sexism) so that the situation doesn't and can't escalate.

If you intend to invest in BTC make sure it's your own holdings in your own wallet where you and only you hold the private key.

I imagine the people sitting on that amount of BTC looking to turn it into a house are few and far between anyway.
