If I win, I will give 100'000 USD to one worthy cause. Consider this a self-experiment on integrity.

I was thinking about doing the same thing, but now you were faster :D
I would change the following things though:
It would be nicer to have deep tones for small (frequent) transactions, and the high tones as embellishment of a nice relaxing bass melody. Several reasons:
1) The background of a melody usually changes the least - this is normally the deeper tones for most music styles.
2) High tones are usually more indicative of something special happening in a melody than deep tones - which would make more sense for really big transactions.
3) Humans pay more attention to high tones than to deep tones, so again, it would make more sense to have the less frequent events be higher in pitch.
Additionally, you could slightly change the volume depending on the pitch, too. For instance, by having the volume be a little lower for very frequent (small) transactions.
Let me know if you will consider implementing this or offering it as an option, otherwise I might take a look at the code at some point.

Wow, kudos to the EFF for how thoughtfully they handled this. You deserve the donation and more.

Traditional 2-factor authentication (SMS, authenticator app, hardware key) will not really make your approach a 2-factor authenticated website. It needs to use two out of the three traditional authentication factors:
* something you know
* something you have
* something you are
As the cryptographic key, as a file on your computer, is something you have, just as much as a phone or authenticator, you don't have the knowledge factor anymore. Getting rid of passwords will thus decrease overall security.
Two methods is not the same thing as two factors.

Which, *de facto*, eliminates micro transactions for almost every user, because they have absolutely no clue how to get them relayed.
