The absolute greatest threat is government regulation. If bitcoins poses a challenges to central bank issued currencies then wide spread banning with ensue but I don’t think it would kill bitcoin or cryptos in general but only serve to delay the inevitable. Global decentralized digital currency is here to stay one way or another

If they did the slightest amount of research they would quickly find the answers to most of these questions, instead it’s instant panic and some one fix it for me

That’s insane. It’s bullshit like this that reaffirms my belief in the need for a decentralized global currency. I think if we see another 2008 type recession where people are seeing their life savings dwindle to nothing there’s gonna be a flood to cryptos

I’m sorry but ETH has gained a lager market cap than BTC this year?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:54:35
Hahaha...awesome! What software did you use ?

It’s been taking much longer since after thanksgiving and now grandma, grandpa, uncle Joey and the cat are signed up on coinbase

Unfortunately though those of us residing in NYS don’t have too many options

Paper wallet
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:02:13
lol so what is it then? Just bots buying and selling the same denomination? Legitimately curious 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:45:45
I see. Because the exchange already has the coin
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:19:51
There’s plenty of info on “what’s happened” but I agree there’s too much focus on THE PRICE. What I feel is truly important is how does bitcoin gain mass adoption as a currency and not just a speculative store of value. What happens if we all just have this really expensive digital cash that nobody uses? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:55:35
Already have but I like to see what’s going on and it’s making me a little sick. These assholes are trying their hardest to kill bitcoin it seems

Gonna be another crazy week I feel. Hodl on bitches!!

Hahaha but you know you will
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:51:53
Fuck coinbase. They pulled a huge insider trade and made a killing. I honestly felt they had some integrity but yesterday’s shenanigans proved me wrong. Moving to Gemini 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:18:42
Yes but it seems like it will be getting a little surge. Honestly haven’t taken a close look at it myself but all I’ve heard or read so far is taxes being cut resulting in 1 trillion being added to the deficit. I’m no economist but seems like the groundwork for a future recession is being laid and once again we will be the ones being asked to do more with less and this is why I feel that ultimately more people here in the US will turn to crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:54:34
Wow! I already have been and certainly won’t be stopping anytime soon
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:00:10
Yes but right now everyone who I know that hodls any is doing only that with it because why spend something that can triple in value in the near future. I myself am guilty of this. The scenario I like to imagine is that as we reach market saturation and the price becomes less volatile we will see more people using it to transact 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:54:08
Just look at the current rate of growth and apply that math forward
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:08
The dip may be coming down from a point much higher than here
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:50:04
Thank you. Now it makes sense 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:11:55
Didn’t know 3-5yrs was forever. Market cap increased nearly 200 billion in a month
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:42:05
I’m going to patreon right now. It’s because of him that I gained enough confidence in the emerging tech to invest more than I had been previously willing to do and he’s also taught me much through his videos which in turn has helped me convince others to get on board and we are all doing well as a result. So thank you Andreas and keep on keeping on, you will have a place in history!

Don’t worry they resolve your issue and when they do be sure to come back here and let everyone know that they did 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:15:42
I️ agree. But I️ think bitcoin has a long way to go before we see anything like a pop and I️ feel that a price stabilization is more likely than a complete crash to zero. Mass adoption is coming and one way or another crypto currencies will transform how we use money. This isn’t tulips, it’s a new technology with real world applications most of which have yet to be conceived 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:41:01
I hope your right this administration has worked hard to try and undo anything from the obama administration as well as anything that can be considered regulatory. I think we as citizens and members of the crypto ecosystem will need to make our voices heard. This will grant the ISP’s with huge power
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:57:55
Sorry was hoping that link would be clickable, new to this. It’s an interesting read and honestly doesn’t have me worried. Posted it here to try and get some other people’s input 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:55:14
That’s why I never click on the first result 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:18:34
Yes, but it could lead to an attack on crypto currencies and as you stated content providers will surely be the first to be attacked which is why the whole net neutrality debate got started as I recall. The ISP’s wanted to hit content provides with high charges for broadband or face throttling of service. Also this guy Ajit Pai worked for Verizon in the past which leads me to believe his position on the matter may be biased
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:50:42
 Fuck that dipshit, he probably hasn’t got squat in bitcoin. We are living in some amazing times, stay focused on what’s important to you right now and simply ignore the smoke and smile 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:29:42
Your not. The price will draw everyone in and then mass adoption will follow 
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:33:18
