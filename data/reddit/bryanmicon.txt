Seems odd that you would start your post by thanking me, then end with a swipe at SwC.
1)  I donate much of my time debunking what I believe are bitcoin-facing scams &amp; misguided efforts.  See:  Pirate, BFL.  Of course a new btc poker site with a nice video would grab my attention
2) the biggest yellow flag raised is the "crowdsale," essentially asking the community for 400 bitcoins.  Your "manifesto" says 58% will be used for marketing purposes.  If anyone buys the rakeback tokens, they are funding your marketing campaign and betting on the longevity of your future site.  To me it seems like marketing expenses are the responsibility of the site and players shouldn't be tempted into bankrolling them unless they get a bigger piece of the pie, i.e. future revenues.   
Maybe you will attract funding this way, maybe not.  IMO rather odd to raise money like this.
Good luck out there.

Being a trader, how about forgetting credentials (lol Atlas) and restricting this debate to "Day Range" being misleading and arbitrary.

After Dave Perry showed me his physical wallet I asked how he trusted the wallet company to make it with his private key.  That's when he explained to me Mike Caldwell's latest platinum hit, his BIP38 private key qr-code password encryption, and that deserves mad love.  I am considering turning it into a functional site with a really nice UI to hand-hold-ishly explain BIP38 &amp; why WIF is dangerous, and have the users be able to live-generate a new address browser-side with that awesome bitaddress.org github.  Can't hurt to have another instance of it IMO.  
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:29:52
1)  Internet boner
2)  Jimmy, as you have clearly discovered bitcoin is ready for wikipedia.  All of those funding drive banners I see can have QR codes.  I have never donated to wikipedia before but I sure as shit will be there with bitcoin on when you start.  I believe there to be a ravenous group of nerds behind me ready to do the same.
3)  Play around with electrum and other deterministic wallets like carbonwallet.  Understand how much more control you have over your coins vs. a hosted wallet like Coinbase (although they are awesome as and exchange and payment processor, I don't love them as cold storage)
4) IMO keep small % of bitcoin donations in bitcoin.  Bitpay (and I think Coinbase does it too) has a slider-bar you can select how much to insta-convert to USD and EFT to a bank account and how much to save as bitcoin (and empty that to cold storage wallet every so often)  If us early adopter / evangelists are right, the currency should appreciate vs. the USD over time.   I remember reading in one of your initial denials of wikipedia taking bitcoin for donations, you mentioned something about it not being proper for the board to approve taking this shenanigans cryptocurrency (I'm paraphrasing) I'll bet at this stage of bitcoin the board is all for it.  Who knows, holding a % in bitcoin longterm may eliminate the need for these pledge drive banners forever, and the wikimedia empire can grow as hard as it wants.

Was also thinking about doing something really creative like kicking the dust that is generated from the ad revenue into the actual key pair demonstrated on the site, see who sweeps fastest initially, then change it up a bit and BIP38 it with an easy pw and see who cracks it first, then maybe make it harder and harder to really test the crypto

I wrote an article for bitcoin magazine in 2012 about how I thought the next few years of bitcoin gambling would go.  I can't find the link right now :(  
I am the site pro / Marketing director for SealsWithClubs. SealsWithClubs is the gold standard for online poker in May 2014.  
We have right now 348 players logged in right now and while there are some copy-cat competitors and a few more professional offerings for bitcoin poker, none have taken hold like SwC.
We are one of the oldest bitcoin gambling sites of any kind, and one of our developers was wondering the other day if anyone has held the coins securely for so long of any entity.  I don't have time to research that, as the WSOP is days away, but it is a source of wonder for me as well.
2011 We started the site.  We found some amazing developers along the way that allowed us to harden the security along the way.  We have had much thrown at us (strong DDoS's), and made some missteps along the way (DB Leak) but through it all diligent human support and a smart cold storage system has kept all the coins safe *SO FAR*  
It is a duty that weights heavily on all of us.  My personal reputation is no doubt at stake with SwC.  The humans that work tirelessly on the project are some of the finest I have ever known in both moral fiber and pure brilliance.  
We are a small yet dedicated team and we plan to properly scale our site, improve our connectivity, make a bunch of new games, deepen our "krill" rewards system, and generally do it as right as it's ever been done before.
I could AMA about SwC in another thread, but on the btc-gambling-industry level I'd also like to give a shout to Nitrogensports.eu, a badass really well done sportsbook, and Bitzino.com, a really well done online casino.  Gambit.com is worthy of a mention too, play all your favorite board games for bitcoin - lots of skill games with variance.  
GLGLGLGL out there, I may be the most familiar bitcoin gambling expert out there, so understand my SwC bias but ask me anything about the industry I'll tell you what I know

As a guy who helped build the current marketing leading bitcoin poker site starting in 2011, I understand how hard it is to start a poker site from nothing.
On the surface this is a nice presentation, but for me it raises a bunch of yellow flags:
- seems wrong to ask for bitcoin before there is any poker site to play:   "pay us 2 btc for a counterparty asset that has no current value but pays 100% RB for life on a poker site that doesn't exist yet" seems wrong to offer before there is any action.
- I have never heard of the dev team.  This alone isn't enough, but I figure I would know at least one guy from bitcointalk/gambling or the last 3 yrs of my bitcoin travels.
- a Costa Rican company asking for your bitcoins and saying they will use 58% of funds raised for marketing is a yellow flag to me.  It's like, they don't have their marketing budget unless you invest your bitcoin in a counterparty rakeback token.  A yellow flag for sure
Well, We have so much work to do with SwC as we enter 2015 I don't have much more time for this one, but I sure hope the good humans of r/bitcoin don't lose any coins on this one.

So they tried to sound professional.  That is at least a fun change.  
"We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly"
is nice marketing-speak if your customers don't expect your company to be doing anything right now.  
But, MagicalFucks (can't be the 1st to coin that phrase) (lol @ using "coining a phrase" with regards to bitcoin) decided to copy-paste the wrong marketing speak.  What a board of directors would have him say, if Gox was organized as such, is something like 
"We regret to inform our customers that our ongoing technical issues continue.  We are working tirelessly to correct this and understand the gravity of the situation."  
Forget the bonus points that could have been received by saying 
"We thank the bitcoin core developers that have donated their time to help us save our business.  We are sparing no expense on the efforts to restore MtGox to full working order"

1)  Thanks very much for this post.  IMO micropayments in Africa is going to be a huge growth area for bitcoin over the next 5-10.  Gone will be the days of high fees to transfer small money.
2) mpesa is basically universally accepted in Africa?  How easy to change mpesa to bitcoin?  How easy to change it back?  You mention within 100m you can find a guy - are they everywhere?  Like every cell phone store has some sort of a defacto bitcoin exchange? Some website to go from mpesa--&gt; bitcoin or reverse?
3) is the internet ubiquitous enough to support a bitcoin economy?  I think Africa is just screaming for bitcoin - from the hyper-inflation that lead to me owning a $100T dollar Zimbabwe bill to the lawless, uncontrolled areas, there is certainly a need for low fee internet money that works everywhere.

Just bought this book with bitcoin last night, you pay once then can download the .pdf or .epub.   I had to buy the pages of Julian Assange's thoughts on how cryptography is the answer to corruption.  I went to the small publisher's site a few days ago, was unimpressed that there was no bitcoin purchase option.  While I planned to buy the book 100% even if I needed North Korean Won to do so, I delayed purchasing at that moment.  Luckily it looks like it only took the boys at Bit-Pay about a day and a half to convince the publisher to take BTC for it.  I saw on Reddit there was a bitcoin purchase option and like a good bitcoin consumer and instantly bought it, quickly rewarding a business for accepting our beloved crypto-currency.

2) but the sad fact is that your teacher likely couldn't make it in business.  This is likely due to many factors, not having vision being one of them.
traditional orgs seem to mock bitcoin when they don't understand it.  Once they understand it they list it as possible helps or threats to their models.
it is still early in Bitcoin.  Watch the dominoes fall over time.  Some won't get it right now.  Just wait.

The backed by full faith &amp; credit part? 
It means the USD is backed, in essence, by all of the geo-political influence, the massive military might, and the ability of said org to raise money internationally (credit, as in the USA's credit, or ability to borrow) 
A non-negligible statement, in fact so strong that the USD is the world reserve currency (although that may be changing soon) In a chicken-and-the-egg type of situation, the USD being a world reserve currency makes it a stronger, more desirable currency.

Some may not want to talk realistically about the very interesting beginnings of bitcoin and what initially gave it value c. 2011.
Hint:  It's fucking drugs.  That was the main reason why bitcoin was initially valuable.  This is provable fact and a part of our crypto-currency history.

1)  Ripple is not bitcoin
2)  Ripple discussion doesn't belong in r/bitcoin
3)  There should be an r/ripple which will likely be a ghost town, as deserved.
4)  No one I know uses Ripple for anything. Since 2011, I have never seen a use case for it.
5) The only reason we are still talking about it is because of the constant VC marketing blast behind it.

1) this happened to me ~2 yrs ago when I was attacking BFL.  0'ing out epic threads (I had a few friends re-post and eventually they got the proper 100+ ups as expected) 
2) Always thought it was a terrible idea to have Theymos &amp; friends as mods here.  Bitcointalk + r/bitcoin is a huge % of the bitcoin media.  Control should not be centralized.
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:52:30
I posted this because the media is powerful. 
"he who controls the words controls your thoughts" 
In the btc world, bitcointalk is easily the  resource for all things bitcoin, with r/bitcoin being a non-negligible 2nd place with (wow has it grown since I last checked) 160k+ subscribers.  
A few years ago I went hard exposing "Pirateat40" when he was running a huge Ponzi.  (not as big as Josh Garza's GAW ponzi, but bitcoin wasn't as big then)   
Then I went after BFL for being a giant scam as well.  
Each time BFL-Josh crossed the line, like posting in the SealsWithClubs thread, I asked for moderator assistance only to find pushback.  It was clear to me that the BFL-ad purchases each week were influencing Theymos' decisions. 
I also encountered pushback on the Pirate situation.  I came to learn later that Theymos "invested" early in the ponzi and divested long before it went boom.  While I don't believe he was connected all the way to the top, I do find this behavior a bit shady.
Wish he and those close to him weren't in charge of bitcointalk or this sub, but it doesn't look like he will relinquish the power without a fight.  
IMO the bitcointalk forum should be managed by a smart M-of-N system.
@_date: 2015-04-18 08:04:25
Theymos: "Even though I want to protect forum PMs as much as I can, users of any website should be aware that it is basically impossible for any service to completely protect data that you give them access to."
He has collected USD normalized millions.  You'd think he would commission zero-knowledge PM system instead of saying it's impossible to protect data.  Spider Oak does it:

how the USA "backs" their currency: 
- preventing of counterfeiting.  Lets say North Korean starts producing huge amounts of really-close looking $100 bills with the 1996 mint year on them (they did this, est. $50M worth, will have to find a source but well google-able)   Then the USA tries everything to stop it.  (like printing up all new $100 bills once they realize) 
- "full faith and credit" also refers to the USD denominated instruments such as bonds.  USA historically doesn't default on their bonds, thus their rates are very low, enabling them to borrow money cheaply.  See: Greece for an alternative example.  That situation effects the entire EU, so it's not quite the same, but you see the difference
- By minting new currency (technically the Fed also destroys currency, but as I understand it usually old and tattered bills, and usually not nearly as much as they are printing) the USA is supposed to be managing inflation.  I will fully admit I have tried very hard to understand the Fed, who decides to print more money, or why everyone just accepts this process without really understanding it, but alas we will need an expert in this area to explain it properly to us.

Here is the entire thread --&gt;    I walk in Day 1 CES (1 day before this video) and then post that BFL took ~$25M in pre-orders for ASIC mining chips and brought only 2x $100 Android devices, 3 cases, an FPGA miner and a box of fans to CES.  This is just a fact-based analysis of what they brought. I posted that I would be back today to better document the hardware they brought to display at CES, and this guy had read my previous posts and understood I was a skeptic.  Instead of showing his technology to a skeptic, he insulted me.

Here is my full account of day1 CES me vs. BFL:
This is to the best I can remember.  I wasn't recording anything day 1, wasn't planning on anything but sneaking into CES to shake some BTC hands as I always do when BTC companies buy booths in Vegas for conventions.
1)  About "sneaking in" to CES:  I always "sneak in" to all conventions I want to go to here in Vegas.  I wear my WSOP media badge from a few years ago and just walk in like a boss.  Sure I could call whatever bitcoin-facing booth is there and have them give me a badge for the ~30 minutes I'll be there.  As will all conferences, the booth buyers usually need to pay extra for another badge, or at the very least pull a "hey let me use your badge and then I walk out with 2 badges and give one to you"   - I "sneak in" because it is +EV for everyone involved.  Next time, if ever, BFL comes to the conference I will acquire a legitimate badge as it was clear they called security to have me removed.  
2)  About the "stomping and cussing" on day 1 that Josh keeps referring to.  First off, Josh was not there day 1.  Only Dave was in the booth representing BFL.  I imagine Josh was off doing Yoga or other form of meditation &amp; self-reflection.  We will get to that in a second.  Let's start at the beginning:
3)  Whenever a bitcoin booth at any conference comes to Vegas, I go to say hi, shake a hand, say "hey, I'm Micon.  I help Freemoney run SealsWithClubs, the market leading bitcoin online poker site."  And just see who is there and what they want to talk about, trade bitcoin ideas for ~20-30 minutes then be on my way.  I have done this many times and met a bunch of BTC industry leaders.  Erik Voorhees I met this way and he is an amazingly awesome human, and Charlie Shrem I met I think at the same Money2020 conference maybe 6 months ago or so at Aria, and I had Charlie on my donkdown podcast for an awesome interview about the bitinstant operation based in New York.  I was skeptical about parts of bitinstant and bitpay at the start, but when I asked the company directors of those organizations I was met with clear answers and follow up interviews.
4) Ok so I was on the same grind on day 1 CES - just go and meet the boys again, shake some hands, congratulate bitpay on the round of funding, etc.  My daughter was born ~ 2 weeks ago but I made time before picking my parents up at the airport to stop by CES to do this because I feel it is very important, + I'm a huge nerd and CES is nerd porn.  Right after the nerd porn convention they have a real porn convention here but that's not the point of this story.  When I found the Bitpay booth,  I didn't realize they would be sharing a booth with BFL, in fact I was very excited to see BFL equipment on display and I planned on asking some extremely nerdy questions about how the hardware will solve the proof-of-work problem much, much faster than current equipment.  I also wanted to understand the metrics of what ASIC will do to the network hash rate, as I understand mining conceptually but not technically.
5) Dave immediately engaged me when I walked near the BFL equipment.  I congratulated him on selling a large amount of pre-orders.  he said in a smug way "yeah... we've done very well"  To a studied poker professional such as myself, his body language gave me the impression that this man felt by collecting the pre-order monies he has already done well.   If I were in his shoes, the first thing I would have said was "We have a huge responsibility to get these things shipped ASAP.  The community has handed us a large amount of money"   I would feel like the weight of the world was on my shoulders to make good on the massively distributed promise of sending these machines.  Dave felt like a winner, IMO.
6)  I asked very plainly "is this your ASICs" or something to that effect.  This is when it got predatory.  He showed me the box of fans + 1 android tablet and said that is where ASIC chips will eventually go, and the android device will be the output screen to show you how fast it's mining and other stats.  I asked what the cube connected to a second android sitting on top of the fan-box was, and Dave said it's an FPGA miner that BFL used to sell, but it wasn't currently mining and you can't buy it from BFL anymore.  I asked Dave what items were available for purchase right now from BFL that they could ship immediately, he said there were none.  I then asked when they would ship ASICs, he said "in a couple of weeks," and showed me 3 cases that ASIC chips would come inside.
7)  After it was clear I was no longer a friendly and was asking some tough questions, he hit me with a classic scammer line something to the effect of "if you don't believe in BFL, then you don't believe in bitcoin."  This is where the "stomping and profanity" as Josh put it came in.  Please don't take Josh's or My word for it - Ask the bitpay guys about this next part - I give a very intelligent response to Dave, certainly using profanity for emphasis (but not in the personally derogatory way that Josh Zerlan does to me here:  ) more like "I believe so much in bitcoin that I wear this fucking button (point to bitcoin button I always wear when leaving the house for any reason) each day, and help run the market leading bitcoin online poker site, dedicating most of my awake time to the betterment of this technology."  Ask the bitpay guys.  I was certainly pissed off, and this guy used a classic scammer line on me and IMO it required a forceful response so Dave understands that I'm a real guy with real BTC credentials, and his line is bullshit and +1's in my head that he and his company are dishonest.
  After my response, emotions briefly settled, and I asked him when filled with ASICs how fast this machine would hash at.  He said something like 1+ T-hashes per second.  I.e. 1000 ghashes/s , would produce in terms of Dave did not know network hashrate.  I told him it wasn't a test, just tell me about how many T-hashes/s the network hash rate was.  Dave said he still didn't know, so I quickly looked it up on my Galaxy Note II by Samsung running Android Jellybean OS by removing the S-pen and quickly speaking into google "total bitcoin network hashrate"   This site came up:   and to me it looks like the current total bitcoin network hashrate is around 20-25 Thash/s - which means that if Dave was right, just one of these boxes could have ~ 6% of total current network hashing power.   I was surprised he had never run the math before...
9) so after this, I post the pic I took and illustrated that BFL did not bring anything worthwhile to CES.  I posted on bitcointalk that I'd be back tomorrow to film closely and ask the tough questions.  Obviously we all saw Josh Zerlan's response: 
If there is anything that needs clarification please ask.  I am 100% transparent.  I further state that it is possible I have made a small chronological or grammatical error of some sort.  I feel I captured the general feel of the day 1 CES experience as it relates to BFL.

I offer the following other possible BFL scenarios:
1)  They tried really hard at first to make ASICs.  They thought they could do it.  They took $25M in preorders.  For whatever unforseen reason, they can't make it.  It now looks like this:   Rock|BFL|Hardplace   and they are handling it poorly and mismanaging expectations deliberately to continue the pre-order game to try and gamble their way out, maybe find a new chip supplier, whatever.  It's a fail at this point. and they are clearly desperate, with not even 1 device to display at CES.
2) It was a scam from the start.  ASIC pre-orders rush in, they advertise their pre-orders on every ad-click network ever, having already shipped some FPGAs they have cred, they cut and run when the money dries up &amp; declare bankruptcy and who knows where the $25M landed or how it was spent.  
I can't see the scenario where the company is legit and treats a known bitcoin guy like that.  As a rep for SealsWithClubs, whenever I encounter a skeptic I answer every question they have as completely, quickly, and honestly as I can.  I would never tell an SwC skeptic to go fuck themselves as BFL Josh said to me.  I would show them everything and convince them.  But I market a real product that is awesome, they market vaporware so I can see why Josh acted as he did.

this is my biggest fear when making these videos - and i intentionally keep very few BTC in the blockchain wallet I use for these vids.   I do have a healthy fear of giving away the golden goose.  I also have a few ideas to intentionally give away BTC, and without saving the ideas for myself I'll just put them out there for the world because that's cooler to me:
1)  make a similar video / or still images of the QR code of a blockchain.info wallet with a small amnt of coin in it and post it without saying anything and leave a signed msg saying "you figured it out first and get the .1 coin" or something like that
2)  make many blockchain.info wallets, print out all the pair-device QR codes, get a stack of like 100 of them and digitally with paper make it rain in the club once this BTC thing catches on or maybe do it at Defcon this year (shotgun the next idea at Defcon)
3) digitally make it rain, create 1000 blockchain.info wallets and digitally store the QR codes of 1000 pair'd device screens and put .1 btc in each one of them and "digitally make it rain" with some sort of a multi-projector device which will display the QR codes all over a dark Vegas nightclub with the music bumping and the QR codes with no announcements everywhere all over the walls, moving ever so slowly while they play MC Lars / MC frontalot Nerdcore players and shit.  the defcon guys will start scanning / figuring it out / as the QR codes get device-paired they dissapear, akin to some1 picking up the dollar bill when u make it rain in the club.

Ripple is nothing like BitPay.
I agree Ripple is different than a cryptocurrency and likely deserves it's own definition, something like a "Crypto-trust system" or "crypto-IOU system"
  this page is simply an abortion
If ripple is supposed to be an easy currency exchange, I sure don't see many ppl using it.  I don't even understand how someone would get the USD from BTC using the XRP.  Is there a physical send of cash involved?  a "Gateway" does it?  then why not go directly to that gateway, i.e. bitstamp?  I just don't see the point of it at all and very, very few seem to be using it.

yup sure do have pornhub locked and loaded.  I'm 34, married, have a newborn, &amp; still a sexually healthy man.  In fact, even though I consider my wife very attractive, I am also attracted to many other attractive females.  Instead of acting on these urges (I live in Vegas) I instead choose to jerk off, not cheat on my wife, and just deal with the inner-anguish of not having multiple sexual partners most men truly desire if they remove the layer of denial they are "extremely happy" with only having sex with 1 woman.  I don't have all the answers to human sexuality or how we fuck it up each and every day, but I know I'm a lucky man to have this beautiful family and if I don't fullfill my cock's need to conquer everything and get this beautiful family in return then I'm going to burn me up some pornhub like a boss and when my wife heals (she is actually doing amazing, but even ahead of schedule I'm looking at months) I'll get back in the saddle.

IMO it is unfortunate that the same power structure that exists on Bitcointalk, easily the biggest forum, also exists on Reddit in the mods.  Why aren't there more mods here?  This is a very important social media arm of bitcoin.  Theymos should not run 2 of the "big ones" IMO.
