Google "bitbook bitcointalk" and read the last few pages of the thread. The owner is claiming to be working on getting it fixed, and he also mentioned being able to recover a database. Still not sure how reliable his information is. 
People have speculated his funds are tied up in Gox, or he just ran off with the money, but only time will tell.

So you're saying it should be legal to drink and drive on private roads such as NJ's Turnpike? Since the government doesn't own it and is supported by tolls, no laws should be applied?

I'm curious as to the reasoning behind this if you don't mind explaining. Thanks!

I was just pointing out that this would be the ONLY thing still giving the article just a tiny bit of credit. I don't disagree with you, just wanted to point that out.

The feds have a conviction rate of ~95%. It never looks good when the feds are after you.

Don't forget his name matches up perfectly. That has to give just a tad bit of credit to her report. Although, the real SN could have just picked some random name out of the phone book and it happened to be this poor guy, among other theories.

Hey twenty, I was searching for btc sportsbook on here and this post was one of the top ones. I bought some potcoins off of you a few weeks ago.
Anyway, just wanted to make sure you had a good experience with bitbook. I'm about to sign up if you approve of it. I don't see anywhere to plug in a referral code on here, but I would happily sign up so you benefit a little if that was possible.

I'm going to guess phones would be even more expensive if they recycled them into new ones instead of just mining more raw material. It always comes down to the bottom line for those huge companies, and if recycling was cheaper than mining, they'd be doing it already.
Seems like finding a viable way to transform old materials into parts for new phones will make somebody bank, while also helping the environment immensely. Win-Win.

That makes some sense, although I could still see some cases coming down to whether or not a contract was physically signed. Someone could just tell the judge the btc's were a gift while you tell the judge it was a loan. He would once again have to decide who is telling the truth, much like what goes on with fiat now, unless there was a contract signed. Is this logic flawed?

Just join under username "tontre" once the website is back up. Former fanduel user here, so this is right up my alley. Thanks!

A former NFL player who lives in my state was arrested this year, along with his mother, for fraud. They went around to 5 different banks on the same day, and got a loan from each. Well the previous loans that day "weren't in the system yet", so each loaning bank thought they were the first in line to be paid off, or to be able to foreclose on the house.
When the banks were never paid back, there were 5 banks with a $400,00 loan and only one house to foreclose on. Seems like the same type of problem that is being discussed about, but with USD instead of bitcoins. His trial is coming up soon, and if bitcoin is ever legitimized, this type of double spend fraud should be prosecutable.

Gotcha. The way things are now definitely need some kind of overhaul.

I just had an unexpected experience as well. One of the main bosses at my facility tried telling me he has ~7 million in Bitcoin since he bought in 7 years ago at 50 cents each.
Funny thing is, I don't think someone is going to come out of retirement to work nights when they have that much stored away. And then to make it even more hilarious, he is trying so hard to get me and other coworkers to sign up for USI Tech so he can get a $6 dollar commission on each of us.

Not sure if this is still true, but about two years ago when I first opened an Ally account, and I asked customer service about their stance on bitcoin, they were "against cryptocurrency" and it could get you banned. I still moved from a bigger brick and mortar bank to them and have had no complaints over the past few years. I mistakenly used it at Coinbase one time with the transaction going through fine.
I don't use an ATM too often so the two or three times each month are always reimbursed fully. Other family members have been happy with Ally for longer than I have been with them.

I won some money from them back in high school (2008) when it was sportsbook.com and had no problems withdrawing at all. I would feel comfortable using sportsbook.ag if I wasn't with Nitrogen already.
