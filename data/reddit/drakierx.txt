Tell that to everyone in 2017 who became filthy rich in a matter of months.

What if that politician ends up being the president?

But the US president announcing support for bitcoin would skyrocket its value. I feel like that’s clearly awesome for anyone who’s invested in bitcoin such as myself.

He supports bitcoin as a currency and actually wants it to survive unlike many other politicians (including righties) who simply want to ban it.

How so?
@_date: 2019-04-21 06:11:39
I understand the idea that rising rapidly could cause several issues. 
I’m just saying that for investors who bought btc before the dip or even right now at its low point, they would be glad that it even got a chance to reach back up at all. Think about when it rapidly grew in 2017, do you think the lucky bastards who bought low and sold their btc at the high point cared about the issues you described?
There’s a ton of investors wishing that it would go back up to $20K so they could at least break even. Because in the current state we’re facing a real possibility that it won’t happen.

I see. So he still wants it regulated.
I still see any support as a good thing. It’s especially good for current investors because the value would skyrocket. Also he likes the idea of treating bitcoin as actual money instead of just security, so this least bodes well for the longevity of bitcoin as a method of transaction.

But Andrew Yang does. Unlike other politicians, he’s very insightful about technological innovations and has specific ideas on how to treat bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-21 20:39:28
Well I hope you’re right about it being untaxable.
In any case, Andrew Yang supports bitcoin as an existence and does not wish to ban it. To me that’s good news.

Which is why he wants to tax bitcoin. Then it wouldn’t really be a threat to his distribution plan.
Wanting to tax bitcoin doesn’t mean wanting to ban bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:52:44
I think it’s the opposite. Expecting bitcoin to never get taxed is the more unreasonable expectation.

It’s harmful in the sense that increasing so rapidly means it will eventually crash back down. But from the point of view of a current investor, the crash doesn’t matter because they’re just glad that it skyrocketed at all, giving them a chance to sell and claim a huge profit.

Well what does she know? 
She’s just a grandma.
