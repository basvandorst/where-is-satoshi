As you should.  I posted this on another thread.
I came very close to being hacked even while using 2fa.
I woke up to see I had two texts on my phone, one from AT&amp;T thanking me for enabling web messages and another from google with an authentication code. Somebody gained access to my AT&amp;T account and enabled their web based text messaging service to intercept the recovery code sent via text from google. The only thing that stopped them from raining a shitstorm of identity theft on me was the fact that AT&amp;T's online messaging system isn't compatible with iPhones when iMessages are turned on. I wrote AT&amp;T and told them how huge of a security risk that service is. I'm sure zero fucks were given.

Here's what I see as the largest problem with BTC at the moment.  


It's too lucrative to just hold on to them right now because the value is increasing so rapidly.  At the same time, there's no longterm value if nobody is actually going to spend them on goods and services.  The value needs to level off before people actually want to start using them instead of cash for everyday purchases.

This is probably the best explanation of bitcoin I've seen in the media to date.

I was thinking about this very thing today.  What BTC is lacking is a merchant intermediary to assume the risk and to allow for an instant trusted transaction.  I'm really surprised that nobody has introduced this as a business model yet.  Coinbase appears to do it for online transactions but I don't know of any company that is doing this focused on point of sale transactions.  It's very possible that this exists and I'm unaware.  An easy to use app that facilitates this is the piece that's missing and would have huge potential.
