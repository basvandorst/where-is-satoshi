Yeah, it's not 1997 anymore. Microsoft has been taking security seriously for a while now. I'd be way, way more concerned about the Java based servers.
Plus intrusion detection systems, deep packet inspection, network trend monitoring, role-based access controls, and hardware firewalls are all really good at keeping people away from the private bits of your systems in the first place. And yes, they're used in front of Linux systems too. A layered approach to security is always appropriate.

The Home Office deduction is also an easy way to trigger audits because it gets abused a lot, so get advice from a real tax professional before taking the deduction.
Particularly, you must have a part of your home that is "exclusively used on a regular basis" for business. Also, the deductions are based on square footage of that area (or percentage of your home), so a small mining rig might only net you a $10-20 deduction.

Thanks, I didn't see that thread. And yeah, while Windows still has plenty of viruses and malware targeting the platform, Linux (and software based on it) is the  target for people going after servers rather than users. And what do servers have? Usually lots of bandwidth, great for making the server part of a botnet. If you're lucky, you'll get a lot of people's personal information too. 
Linux may not get a lot of viruses, but it does have vulnerabilities that get targeted constantly, usually with bigger consequences. This idea of Linux being invulnerable is nonsense. The only secure system is one that has all its ports sealed with epoxy and is kept in a shielded bunker.

Yeah, not sure how I mixed that up. Fixed.

My guess - and it is just a guess, though a slightly educated one - is that most banks are using a private SSL implementation, or Windows-based servers, or older OpenSSL implementations. none of which would be vulnerable to this particular attack.
Doing an off the cuff survey, using the URLs of the sites' login forms:
[Chase]( IIS behind F5 BIG-IP^[1]
[TD Bank]( - Probably IIS behind AkamaiGHost^[4]
[Schwab]( IIS
[Bank of America]( behind F5 BIG-IP^[1]
[Citibank]( probably Microsoft IIS behind it
[Wells Fargo]( Java Server / Netscape Enterprise Server 6.0^[5]
[CapitalOne360]( behind F5 BIG-IP^[1]
1. Only version 11.5+ of BIG-IP has a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, and then it's only used if it's set to non-default ciphers, which most sites won't do because it's a huge performance hit.
2. wtf.
3. Could be vulnerable, depending on version. Banks are typically slow to update, so it might not be. Or it might.
4. [Akamai says they are "fully patched"](
5. Uses OpenSSL, but no idea what version. Server identifies itself as "KONICHIWA/1.0" but [its footprint reveals its true identity](
If you want to check a site for yourself, plug it in here:

I'm not really good at ELI5.
Basically this vulnerability only applies to OpenSSL. And OpenSSL isn't used by Windows, so anything Windows-based (Microsoft IIS) is unaffected.
Linux, BSD, Mac OSX, and lots of custom hardware use OpenSSL. But since big banks tend to be slow to update things, there's a good chance they're using an older, not-vulnerable version of OpenSSL.
On the other hand, banks using load-balancing hardware or CDN services (Barracuda BIG-IP, AakamaiGHost) could have more recent versions of OpenSSL on those services. Akamai says they're patched, I imagine the other big CDNs are by now too. Hardware devices like the Barracuda one, it depends entirely on whoever's in charge of it.
So in short, any bank running their site on Microsoft IIS without offloading SSL to a device or CDN was never affected, anyone using a Linux based server may have been affected if they were running a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, and anyone offloading their SSL to a hardware appliance or a CDN (very common) may have been affected even if they were using Microsoft IIS but it probably patched by now.
It's not very ELI5, I know. But it's a kind of complicated scenario.

With the price it's at right now, it's a loss for anyone who has bitcoins they purchased since mid November.
Edit: Oh nice, I'm being downvoted for posting a fact. It's a fact that a bitcoin's USD value hasn't been this low since November. Downvoting me won't change that.
Edit2: Well I \*was\* at -2. Thanks, sane people.
