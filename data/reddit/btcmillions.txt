With the gift card, in your example, you'd be give Target the Swedish Kroner directly.

I never opened an account with Mt. Gox, but if I hadn't been following the forums about it over the past year, I might have opened one.

Good point, would be interesting to see if Coinbase or BitPay don't simply hold onto the bitcoin sold, though. So prices are going up when believers and momentum chasers dominate and down when instant-conversion merchants and quitters dominate. There are also forced buyers and sellers (long or short on margin). The news/hype cycle has its own dynamic which has been quite substantial in effect on prices.

The article mentions the criticism that one can buy bitcoin today without recurring fees on it - I'd point out as well that you'd be able to actually use it. Then, it dismisses such criticism with "a Bitcoin ETF will allow investors the ability to exercise different investment strategies regarding Bitcoin that are not currently available in the U.S." You have to wonder, what are these strategies that could justify additional fees?

Quotes from the article:
“The exchange of dollar bills, including high denomination bills, is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly subject to forgery, theft, and loss” 
“The clear use of dollar bills for transacting in illegal goods, anonymous transactions, tax fraud, and services or speculative gambling make me wary of their use. Before the United States gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans”.

I estimate the overhead of adding bitcoin to value chain is less than -$100,000/year because every employee working on this probably thinks it's awesome and wants to contribute extra time to make it work seamlessly.

It's also not necessary for an exchange to hold the money. I haven't been to one of the popular bitcoin meetups yet, but the "exchange" might just be a shared chalkboard, except online. Pay a small fee to look at it, get the address connected with an order, etc.

Neither one paragraph nor a correct argument. Probably a good guess that large gains on the sale of bitcoin (or a large purchase of something with bitcoin) will do the math and report it correctly. Many would even find it easy to account for small transactions, but those handing it out as small gifts to friends or getting lunch with it now and then would probably not bother with a complicated spreadsheet when the profit or loss on each line would not even be worth a dollar.

I could understand what an ETF offers to investors who don't want to figure out how to hold or use bitcoin, but perhaps it's better if they do have to.

With bitcoin, it seems the price has risen along with its usage and utility. That might really take off if people get more comfortable switching units. For instance, if you measure its value by the time spent on faucet sites, which use mBTC units, users already value small amounts at 10 to 100 times the market price. Perhaps that's more of a novelty effect, though.

The pizza shop doesn't care if $5 buys 10 less Yen today; he's not thinking about it because it doesn't matter, to him anyway. The price has become "sticky". And you know, the price of a Coca-cola was stuck, intentionally, for about 70 years. Could easily and eventually occur with any number of goods sold for bitcoin in the future.

I suppose. If that type of product was offered at a retail forex dealer like FXCM, which does $20 billion average daily volume, volume could far surpass Mt. Gox's $2 million a day. Discount by a factor of 10, as margin would be higher, give it 1% of all their trading, and that's still 10X Mt.Gox. However, the prerequisite for that would be huge growth in existing Bitcoin exchanges or ideally, a number of new ones.

There was still lending done on the gold standard, but it seems booms and busts happened more often and were more devastating. Lenders could collect assets used to secure loans in default (as many more would in a deflationary environment), or intentionally game the cycle.

The useful thing here is learning how to use bitcoin, worth around $5 per person to Proofpin. My first bitcoin was worth around $5 as well.

That's a really cool idea- I wasn't aware of transaction scripts. However, a few issues are apparent to me-- you don't seem to account for any compensation to the mediator for his/her effort, i.e. why would he or she help out? Nor do you account for the mediator's ability in fact to arbitrate fairly, i.e. how does the arbitrator know whether to trust the buyer or the seller? He or she might not have much to go on in an anonymous marketplace, and therefore he or she might simply defer to reputation or history, which would lead to a biased decision.

I agree, there's probably something to the idea that these orders were directed from one entity, but the crowd also often moves like one entity. On the issue of roundness, the two accounts seized at Mt. Gox are 2.1M + 2.9M, which seems somewhat round. Playing that game would seem a lot easier as well if you decide to stop adding when you get to a round number, like 1000 or 2000.

Coinbase might also adjust the customers who got a "wonky" price in the same sense of fairness in which they paid the whitehat reward and allowed you to keep the profits.
There's probably also a blanket market rule (perhaps on the SEC's books) against self-dealing, which is essentially being on both sides of the trade at once. So, you ought to keep track of the profit, on the odd chance you have to give it back.

Securing a lot of bitcoin is a daunting proposition, but that doesn't mean expensive armored trucks with guards or fancy vaults. Perhaps a value add. I didn't mean all bitcoin, just those held in the trust. I'm also skeptical of your hypothetical benefit to large purchases- since it's open-ended, the fund still has to go to market to buy more bitcoin, and if that moves the market substantially, the cost passes to the investor in the fund price.

Great currencies also appear to have large prices swings, however it takes a larger, more established economy to buffer the outside volatility, i.e. a loaf of bread stays $2 even though wheat prices have been all over the map.

With a typical high speed internet connection of 2.3 Mbps, 10GB should take 72 hours, or 3 days to download. So, it is well within the reach of the average Internet user, but that avg. speed would need to grow as quickly as the Blockchain size to not take much longer than that.

$2.25 million, the initial investment, is about a day's volume on Mt. Gox. Interesting slide show, but it's not worth the fees, in my opinion. Value-added- none. But fees of 2% ANNUALLY!, plus 1.5% front and back end loads. So by around 2060, they close up shop as all the bitcoin belong to them.

The most succinct explanation is that volume means lots of liquidity, which generally reduces volatility, particularly if it's lively on both sides, unlike on the 10th.

It could have a huge affect or only a little, if there's lack of interest or bitcoin is just not well suited to it. Mt. Gox has been popular with  daytraders, despite not offering margin. So, I have yet to see advantage in that versus simply buying it outright-- others might disagree.
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:06:29
Sure, from a simple accounting perspective, they must be equal. However, you could attribute the loss in various ways, for example to the initial seller of the bitcoin you profited from (i.e. his foregone profit) or to the buyer who may have overpaid (if bitcoin subsequently drops) and the buyer realizes a loss. Or if bitcoin only goes up in price, the "loss" isn't realized by the last to buy, since they could realize the value in services immediately, but is rather shared by everyone who hasn't bought bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-21 21:30:03
There must be a better gauge of value than market cap, since the last trade doesn't indicate what the last bitcoin could be sold for. So if you go further into market depth, the more you have the less they're worth down to nearly zero, if sold immediately.

On the other hand, the degree to which it is crashing now could be proportional to the lack of understanding about it (think mortgage derivatives in the hands of Joe Mainstreet) and the newfound hubris of that inevitably comes with high and rising value (old Joe who bought at a nickel apiece can suddenly afford even the greatest largesse.) By that back of envelope calculation, Bitcoin may quietly spend the rest of year cooling off, but after the obligatory penance, perhaps then it might reward those who truly believe in it.

Very interesting difference, particularly as I see a zero bid/ask spread at the moment at Mt. Gox. In other words, the price would imply that Bitcoin at Mt. Gox right now are actually considered to be more valuable than BTC elsewhere- that makes no sense, unless it is Mt. Gox price-shading, i.e. a hidden fee to a buy-heavy market. I could understand the speculation that their customers willing to bid extra to get BTC just to transfer more easily, but I thought the withdrawals were going through now.

"Made" might not be the correct word, either. [Livermore's bio on Wikipedia]( gets depressing fairly quickly.
"On March 28, 1933, Livermore married 38 year old Harriet Metz Noble in Geneva, Illinois; there was no honeymoon. It was Harriet's fifth marriage; all four of her previous husbands had committed suicide.[10] Livermore would be no different.
Through unknown mechanisms, he yet again lost much of his trading capital, accumulated through 1929. Thus, on March 7, 1934, the bankrupt Livermore was automatically suspended as a member of the Chicago Board of Trade. It was never disclosed to anyone what happened to the great fortune he had made in the crash of 1929, but he had lost it all"

What would stop you in the above example is that you wouldn't want so much value at risk and would find that you can't offset the risk in the real market without destroying your profit margin. So you would obviously turn away the bettor wanting to place USD 10 Billion. The question for an emerging bookie is just how liquid is the Bitcoin market.

The only news I meant to insinuate in the headline was that the other 4 of 5 top exchanges have now broke out above $100. For some time, Mt. Gox has been above, but it's also been somewhat of an aberration in prices, due in no small part to concerns of slow or nonexistent US dollar withdrawal capability. If that were rectified, then the price differential would no longer exist, i.e. it would be arbitraged away.

So much for the hard limit of 21 million. Watch out for derivatives: if casino chips represent bitcoin, people will treat them as equivalent and trade them as such, effectively inflating the system (at least temporarily).

That's a good idea, since it would be more costly with an unwavering minimum fee. It could be due to a number of factors which are unrelated to Bitcoin's growing popularity.

The higher the price goes, the more gets taken by a percentage of assets-based fee. So, if it's a bubble, the value on which such fees were assessed disappears when it bursts. While you can spend actual bitcoin instead of selling them, bitcoin held in funds could only be sold. Could be trouble down the line if that really takes off.

Yes, exactly. If funds don't pay out bitcoin, or likewise if investors don't ultimately want to use it, then it's a classic bubble. If funds take over as the main source of demand for bitcoin, regular bitcoin users would have an incentive to get out before the crowd, knocking the legs out before a crash.
@_date: 2013-09-19 21:38:38
Interesting, that's why I speculated it might be due to the expense in building new vaults or renting them. Then, assuming the cost of an assay is high and that the bars which come back are not likely to be the same ones that left, there might be an incentive to just mix it all around and hope for a least bad outcome through diversification. Rather than lack of trust in banks, mightn't it be lack of trust in the gold itself or the expense of holding it.

This does not necessarily have anything to do with Bitcoin, more than any other asset or currency.
