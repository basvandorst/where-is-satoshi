So, I was [coding]( a bitcoin blockchain .dat file parser in C++ and learnt so many things. Now I finally understand all bytes in a transaction and a block. Next step would be to code private key to pubkey in C++ and then signing and finally I can create my own transaction and broadcast it to the world. It just makes me feel happy that's all. Just wanted to tell everyone that it isn't difficult at all.

You realize bitcoin is open source right? No one needs anyone's permission to work.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:23:55
To the contrary, I want everyone to have basic necessities of life. But who is going to give it to them? Its the rich people. And unless they have an all inclusive and all encompassing view of life, they aren't going to give anything to anyone. Be it dollar rich or bitcoin rich. People have been rich since time immemorial. Bitcoin is just a new "asset" class and currency. What stops people from donating money and removing poverty in the world? It's simple: they don't identify with other people at all. The poor are just a statistic for them. But once you are self realized, you will see that everything is one only. Sharing wealth or knowledge won't be a problem then.
So, to summarize, if you want to quickly remove poverty, spiritual development of the rich is the shortest and the best way. You have a better solution?

There is no value in anything then. Gold is valuable because people believe it to be so. Money is valuable because people think that the country backing the fiat is stable. People value something because other people trust it to be so.
So, when people find out that so many bitcoiners have purchased teslas with their bitcoins, or have paid their debts, or bought new house etc etc., people are going to think that they are valuable. Once that happens, the price will increase exponentially till it hits the next peak.

Reminds me of the time when a guy in my office was bragging that he knows what bitcoins are. I asked him what mining was and he said that miners solve tough mathematical problems to mine bitcoins and only people with high IQ can mine them. I said that given enough computing power anyone can mine and he refused to believe. Apparently he had seen a series in some news channel (we're in india) about bitcoins and how it is going to destroy the world. Still laugh at that dude whenever he tries to bring up something about computers. Some people literally gobble up news.

But it shows that he has to be somewhere in britain to have copied the text in the genesis block. When 2008 financial crisis happened, us was at the center stage. He could have picked up a us newspaper if he wanted to highlight the issue. But he picked up a british one maybe because that was in front of him while creating the first block.

Once clean water is given, people will fight over air, roads, electricity, education, employment, bonus, promotion, religion etc etc. The desires are endless.

He definitely could be british. When you refer to another country's finance minster or top official, you also use the country's name. For example, indian finance minister, american secretary of treasury etc etc. Unless the person or the post is super famous like us president/russian president or trump/putin/kim etc etc, you will use the country's name while using chancellor. Even angela markel is called german chancellor. So, probably he is/was british. May not be in britian, but definitely identifies himself to be british to call the finance head chancellor without using the country's name (britain).

Ya, but no reason to single out britain's headline. Everyone on the internet is obsessed with us news. Sometimes russia or north korean. But mostly us. So, if he specifically picked britain, it must have been because he was personally associated with britain. Either he was british or was in britain at that time.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:40:31
Is anyone surprised? The establishment needs to spread FUD to get in low. Please remember that most rich people in the world don't own Bitcoins like they own real estate, stocks, bonds, gold, treasury notes, etc etc. It is the most liquid of them all with no oversight. It's like their dream come true. A truly global currency. There is no way they don't want to possess it. They just want to get as much as possible before they let it go to the moon.

This statement alone proves that you are from abrahamic religious background and have a very poor understanding of karmic religions, Law of Karma, **TRUTH** and enlightenment.
That being said, clearer minds would provide what is required in the world much faster and efficiently than minds that aren't so. A normal person (rich or poor) has many desires, fears, delusions, hopes, etc etc which distort what is in front of him in many ways. An enlightened being sees what is front of him clearly and does what is necessary. Nothing more, nothing less. You may think that you are helping someone, or you are hurting someone. But without clarity you could be hurting someone without knowing it. So, it is better to become enlightened then go around helping in the world, especially if you are rich.
Of course, I don't think you understand such things. Just keep doing what you are doing. Some people don't deserve to be on the spiritual path. Some other lifetime for you I guess.

Not just search. The whole ecosystem. Like android phones, gmail, chrome browser, their own OS for desktop, own wallet, payment system to buy/sell bitcoins, their wallet integrated with all their platforms etc etc.
People already trust google or are dependent upon it for so many things. Bitcoin will gain major adaptability. Search feature will only make it more legit. Like how google earth is. People aren't really geographers or world explorers. But somehow they fell happy to zoom in and zoom out at various places on earth.

@_date: 2019-07-03 16:39:50
Not really. Once you break this algo, immediately people will shift to quantum computing safe algorithms. If you steal too many coins, there might be a fork and you could end up with orphan blocks. So, the best strategy is to steal slowly from wallets that don't have much movements and look in social media for people reporting theft of bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:15:50
It can happen. But this won't cash transactions. Ultimately sense will prevail and govts will have to allow it. But it could take time, years, maybe decades.
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:30:22
This is a known problem and it is understood to be a big hurdle in adoption. Irreversibility of transactions and loosing of funds by mistake/hacking/phishing etc etc is the risk that will exist forever. You can't have both ways.
In the case of people understanding it, please know that people in india can't even operate an atm properly. Forget netbanking and card swiping. In such cases, bitcoin is light years ahead of their knowledge. This does not make the technology bad. Its just that given enough time, people get used to it.
Take for example of plane crashes. Overtime they have become safer. But you will surely die if the plane crashes. That has not been solved, yet people still rush to fly. When people understand the risks and benefits, they will see which is beneficial for them and choose accordingly. Give it time and people will understand bitcoin and mass adoption will come very quickly. Like the move from dumb phones to smart phones.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:31:40
I think that a lot of people are buying ethereum because they don't know that they can buy part of a bitcoin. $1,250 for 1 ethereum sounds better than partial bitcoin for the same amount. Someone needs to give out this message loud and clear.

@_date: 2019-07-21 13:04:40
I've learnt about bitcoin and ethereum by writing simple code snippets like converting private key to public keys, public keys to addresses, creating and signing transactions, parsing the blockchain etc etc. First go through the wiki. Read some code and then you write most of the code yourself in the language you are comfortable with.
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:15:58
But someone could've taken that if you hadn't.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:46:01

Even I got interested in bitcoins around the time it hit ATH. I started writing small program snippets about various aspects like converting private to public keys, public keys to addresses, parsing the blockchain etc etc and I was convinced that this is robust enough to replace the current monetary system.
Then I started learning about the current monetary system and how its a fraud. That convinced me about the potential of bitcoins and I've never looked back ever since.

This. The wall street has made trillions by managing their portfolio. Once it all goes to shit, they will be the first ones to buy bitcoin and then resell them at very high prices. Definitely 10-50 times of what they've bought at. But when they enter, the price will rise 100-1000 times. Hence the normal people will get to buy bitcoins freely only after its hit $1+ million already. Its sad that rich people control the flow of information so thoroughly that people will loose a major portion of their life's savings.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:22:41
I don't think that drug dealers are that smart about bitcoins. But if they do understand its potential, they will adopt it very quickly. They literally have no morals to give a fuck about.

This is why I think crypto will go 100x long term. People who want to buy don't have much money. But once they do, they are going to invest their life's savings in bitcoins, not stocks, bonds, real estate etc etc. This will drive the prices up from already high levels reached when the institutions enter the place.

This seems to be the most common desire for hodling bitcons: buying a house. The current real estate market is too costly to buy with the current income for most people. When btc hits $100k, a lot of people will sell to buy houses.
@_date: 2019-07-08 00:38:59
If they try to buy all the crypto, they will cause an increase in prices which will make all hodlers rich. They don't want that and hence are spreading FUD to decrease the prices.

Jews own the banks of the world. Bitcoin is directly threatening the banking model. Jews are a close knit community. They won't allow anyone of their own to fuck anyone else of their own.

@_date: 2019-07-01 03:06:04
There is one slight difference though: most of the above assets/stocks are concentrated in a few hands and then the price has increased. Bitcoins is not owned by the elites. There is no way they can seize it from those who have. Mining won't be that productive with passing time.
I'm expecting a huge backlash against bitcoins or a ban to try to seize bitcoins or atleast drive the price down to the ground so that elites can get some for themselves. I'm absolutely sure that libra coin will be hailed as the holy grail and all the suckers will be buying it by the dozens.
@_date: 2019-07-01 06:34:38


But it will simultaneously make other holders rich. That is their biggest fear. They want to get rich, but do not want to create a layer of wealthy people below. They want ultra rich and  ultra poor. No wealthy class who would have enough to not have to goto work everyday.


Yes, but that is because they know the the technology is amazing and very resilient. They love it. They only hate that they were too late and can't control it using the traditional means. I'm absolutely sure when libra comes out, it will be freely exchangeable with bitcoins just to get some suckers in.

That is till they realize it is centrally controlled. But on the surface it is going to be the greatest thing. People and communities funding common projects with people they know. Sending money to people in distress just with a like or some other button that they'll implement. Moving money around the globe will be easier than ever.
The catch of course is loss of privacy and independence. Another facebook scandal a few years later will make people appreciate decentralized currencies like bitcoins.
Till then, libra can be a good tool to educate people about crypto, IMHO.

Yes and no. Bitcoin will only be good for transactions where the govt has minimal or does not want any interference: like defense purchases, paying spies across borders, paying dissenters in other nations, destabilizing other nation's economies etc etc. But in all other domestic matters, they'd rather control the supply and issue of money so that people don't become financially independent and rich.

@_date: 2019-07-29 16:37:46
That is because crypto market is small compared to gold, real estate, bonds etc etc. Wait till it is atleast $1 trillion in market cap for some sort of price stability.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:16:14
Even if that happens, price will boom 100x atleast. But I doubt the banks will let it happen so easily. First they will own as much as possible before making it mainstream.

Funny. Right now I am arguing about bitcoins with someone in and about Law of Karma in That being said, both are governed by the Law of Karma. And don't assume that karma is only good or bad or of this life only. All the lives that you have lived, you create karma. Some you work out, most is just waiting to be unfolded in your life. It does not matter when you accumulated the karma. When the time is right, you will get the results.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:35:41
That's what you think. The technology of bitcoin makes it an almost anonymous payment system across the world. Some elites want to have that. But if they invest heavily in it, the price is going to sky rocket.
It will only become stable when a lot of money is invested in it, like it gold. Total value of gold in the world is around $8 trillion. Bitcoin is $200 billion. Hence you can expect some stability when 16 times more money is invested. Which will only happen if people know what it really is. The media and the govt and the banks are busy spreading FUD, while some elites are accumulating at each dip.
Hodling is real.
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:40:22
True. But libra coin is going to be a hit for a few years, maybe more. You can't even imagine what a good PR team can do with this shit. Imagine facebook posts with pay with libra coin button in them, along with like button. The feel good stories will be shared and money sent across borders. This will make a lot of businesses go online and accept payments. This whole ecosystem will work till people realize that there is no privacy or control. But till then, it will have a solid growth. Just like facebook had till cambridge analytica shit.

@_date: 2017-12-12 06:06:09
Even if they can't ban it, they will attach a social stigma to it. Like any one who deals in monero is a terrorist, drug dealer, child molester etc etc. People are so stupid that they will believe it.

@_date: 2017-12-12 17:37:42
100% increase of $100 is still $100.
But 10% increase of $1,000,000 is $100,000. Although percentage wise it is lesser, absolute value is much much higher. So, the more money you put into it, the more output you will get. So, it isn't wrong to say that rich will get richer.

@_date: 2019-07-07 14:26:50
For anything to be a currency it has to have the following:
* Medium of exchange
* Store of value
* Unit of account
Bitcoin is going through a phase of speculation but when enough wealth has been invested in it, like it is gold, there will be stability.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:30:08
Inflation will erase a lot of your currency's purchasing power. You can't protect yourself against it. See venezuela for example.

People thought the same before the tech boom. Why would they invest in nerdy stuff? You don't need to if you are already rich. But if you want to be rich, you should. Also, a lot of millionaires are a slave to the market. If the market goes down, they will fall out of the millionaire club.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:39:18

Instant. You should atleast have your phone no. verified otherwise no one would want to trade with someone who does not have a verified account. Also, IMPS is the way to go. Money is transferred instantly. Depending on your bank account type, you can transfer money 30 minutes after you've added a new payee. You need to upload screen shot of the payment and sometimes forward the SMS of your debit SMS either on the chat or the seller's no. It is very simple and easy. Read the FAQ. First try with small amounts like 5K to understand how it works. Then you can put in big amounts. Always check the IMPS limit per transaction/day of your bank before starting a trade. People can give a bad feedback and it will not be good.
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:17:16

Power will change hands but it will still be concentrated into the hands of a few. Those twin guys have 100K+ bitcoins. Imagine if one bitcoin hits $1 million, these guys will have so much liquid money that they can literally buy countries. Simple folks like you and me can buy a car and a house and that's about it. But those with so many bitcoins can rule the world. So, the power balance is only going to change from one set of people to another.
@_date: 2019-07-03 10:40:40
And that is why it is a big thing. If they play their cards right, they can literally become the global bank. I think this is good for bitcoin as it will lead to fall in prices and we can pick them up for cheap.

Yes. Don't forget that most of the banking system and media is owned by the jews. By controlling these two, they control the world. Now the alternative media is pretty well developed, they will try their best to shut down any form of money not under their control.
If people are scared that they will get arrested while purchasing bitcoins, it will lead to a fall in prices in short term. But once their FUD is over, price will shoot back up.

I doubt the police will be very proactive in searching for something that is very difficult to prove ownership of. I can literally move my own coins and then tell people that it is robbed. Don't you think the police will understand that?
I am saying easy because you will still need to use some sort of electronic device to access your bitcoins. And if people compromise your laptop which you use to access your cold storage, you will loose your coins.

Yes. You are right. No matter what your are buying(house, car, spaceship), if the value of Bitcoin increases after you purchase something,you have overpaid. So it makes economic sense to HODL. When the price stabilizes to $1 million or something, then we can hope to use it as currency.

The main point is that he doesn't control it. They don't have control over crypto currency and that's what they hate. Like it or not, without banks selling crypto, most people will find it too risky. If we want the price to increase, co operation of the banks is required.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:03:06
I have a theory: all these hacks aren't really hacks but cash outs. Start a decent bitcoin service. Get millions of customers. Then one day claim to be hacked and steal all the bitcoins. The moment I tried to claim my bitcoin gold and saw that the wallet was asking for electrum seed and not individual private/public keys, I knew my wallet could be stolen. We need to be careful of various exchanges and wallets online that store your bitcoins or ask for seeds.

Firstly, you need to understand that this is a trustless system. It does not depend upon one individual to maintain the system. As long as the rewards for mining are high enough, many people will ensure that the system works according to the rules.
Now to answer your questions:
1. The system itself by setting the nonce value every 14 days.
2. Every 14 days it is set according to the average time it takes to mine blocks. The beauty of the system is that each miner and node will calculate the exact same value as it is having the exact same blockchain. Any change and it will fork.
3. if the change is not acceptable by more than 50% of the nodes/miners, it is fork. But if more than 50% accept it, it becomes a part of bitcoin.
Currently no entity has enough hashing power for 50% domination. But practically if someone does get that much power, they can do whatever they want. This is a problem in open source, trustless, open ledger system. This risk is fine as the system is completely decentralized.
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:16:30

That is because buying and holding gold is highly restricted in india. If you let people buy, india is going to soak up all the world's gold. The otc gold volume is nothing compared to what can be if people are allowed to buy freely.

Not if you are ultra rich and want to escape tax jurisdictions. Most rich people won't understand bitcoins, but soon they will know that it can't be touched by the govt. Once that happens, banks will adopt crypto and will get into mining. The bitcoin price will moon. But the catch is that day may come in 10, 20, or 100 years we don't know.

Think about it. You earn a fixed sum of money each month. It is not linked to inflation. But the value of the money itself is linked to inflation. Unless you have some asset that can be used to lock in your savings from time to time, you are essentially at the mercy of the bankers. And guys like buffett and the other bankers hate that.

There are two major hurdles for mass adoption to bitcoins, and if they are overcome or atleast mitigated, we can have some mass adoption.
\* Immutable transactions: in a poor country like india, where people don't know how to use atms, and fall to the most basic net banking scams (even a judge was scammed, countless celebrities), no one is going to buy something that gets stolen and lost.
\* Technical knowhow: Similar to the previous point, most people find it hard to use a smartphone. There is no way to explain something like blockchain to people who don't know anything technical.

I think any technological advancement is adopted by the masses based on convenience. No one wanted to buy a smartphone. But they do want to connect to friends and family. Hence easy to use interfaces were the reason why smartphones became popular. Still many people can't use them. Bitcoin has to become that simple to use.

@_date: 2019-10-17 13:04:57
Another attempt to discredit the cryptocurrencies and bitcoin in particular.
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:31:02
To the contrary, bitcoin like gold, will retain its true value (if it is adopted as digital gold). So saying that $1 million dollar won't be worth $1 million in the future, then the value of bitcoin will be more than $1 million. Also, due to scarcity its true value is only going to increase until almost all the institutional money is in bitcoin. Then we can have stability. But that won't happen below $10 million at least.

That what plebs don't understand about the rich people. It is the elites of china and usa will buy bitcoins. They will try to ban it for the normal people. Since it is in short supply, anyone buying bitcoins will make others rich when he buys it. The elites will play their FUD so that they stack their sats before the plebs are allowed to enter. And when the plebs do enter, it will be minimum $100K per bitcoin. Now is the time to buy bitcoins.

8 years is nothing compared to eternity. **TRUTH** is eternal. If you know the **TRUTH** in this lifetime, it is good enough. All the effort is so that you know the **TRUTH** and live it, so that you can live freely in this world.


Progress can't be measured in years. Some days I truly feel that there is something out there. And some days I feel like shit. The only progress that one can speak of is that I'm now aware of the Law of Karma and that given lots and lots of free time I'll reach somewhere. Right now I'm extremely busy with job and other things. But once btc hits $1 million, I'll be free of family obligation and then I can pursue spirituality full time. Till then only a few minutes per day.

As you can see, this confirms my long held belief that indian govts are completely controlled by the jews. The jewish bankers totally hate bitcoins. They know that india is on a growth trajectory and hence people might be interested in buying bitcoins. Nothing says corruption than them banning bitcoins without actually proving that it is used for drugs and other shitz. Most people are too stupid to even use an atm properly, forget crypto currencies.
Banning and proposing jail time for crypto just shows their mentality of not giving a fuck about the indian people. While muslims and dalits are being killed on the streets, no one goes to jail. Some even become ministers. But you just buy bitcoins for your safety, and you are fucked.
EDIT: And you know modi's fight against corruption is all jhoomla.
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:43:05
It will still prevent most people from buying.this is going to slow the adoption significantly and keep the price down.

1 USD = 5,906.00 VES. 1 BTC = 50,600,000 VES. So 1 USD/BTC =  50,600,000/5,906.00 = 8567.56 USD. Currently the price in US is 7685 USD/BTC which makes it only 10-11% costlier in dollar terms.

So lets see what we have here: 1 BTC/ARS = 380,598.99 ARS. 1 USD/ARS = 44.64 ARS. So, 1 BTC/USD = 380,598.99/44.64 = 8525.96. Currently the price in US is 7685 USD/BTC. So that's around 9-10% costlier that US.

Cryptocurrencies will hit the roof when people realize that you can bypass the banking industry. But the media, banks and the govts are working non-stop to make sure that people don't realize its benefits.
@_date: 2019-06-04 08:17:59
So basically it is corruption? I think almost everyone here understands that the rich are trying to get richer via crypto too. We are doing the same. But the FOMO against crypto and hodling just exposes their hypocrisy. They are just pissed that they can't get the govt to pass laws to hand them crypto like they donto land, money, gold etc etc. Technology has created a completely independent form of asset that can't be confiscated. The rich hate that. And that is why there is so much hate against them. If they were just investors we wouldn't have had a problem.

This. Any banker will tell you that fiat is worthless compared to gold.
@_date: 2019-06-03 07:15:09
With one big difference: you can't confiscate bitcoins if all safety precautions are taken. If you look through history, people have conquered other nations, they took all their gold. Not possible with bitcoins. Even if you kill me, the bitcoins can't be taken. In that sense, bitcoin is even more liquid and safer than gold.
And on the same note, I think some rich and powerful people have understood this and are hell bent on acquiring bitcoins, without others becoming rich in the process. HODLing is not just a philosophy, its arbitrage against whales.
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:53:22
Yes. But still slightly more secure than cash, gold, property etc etc.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:28:56

That is because the powerful people have hoarded it for centuries. So many govts across the world have gone to war over gold. Seizing gold from citizens is one of the constant functions that govts have performed.
That is where bitcoin is different. There is literally no way they can take your bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-06-13 09:04:38

@_date: 2019-06-04 18:54:12
How can they give your or my bitcoins to the rich for cheap? They can confiscate gold, not bitcoin. Only way they can get bitcoins is by spreading FOMO all through the media so that people sell in panic.

Check their charts in usd. They follow a similar trend. Its not a one to one correspondence.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:28:24
This exactly is what people like me have been saying. The rich know that it is perfect. Unlike other forms of asset, they can't exclude people from buying bitcoins. And them buying in bulk will only lead to others becoming rich. Hence FOMO is a *strategy* that they use to get coins for cheap. Do not fall for FOMO/FUD/bullshit and hodl your coins for dear life.
@_date: 2019-02-26 03:52:10
Some banks are freezing bank accounts that are suspected of dealing with crypto. The shit is being treated as illegal. Of course the govt is behind it. They hate crypto. They can't have a population that is not dependent on govt dole outs.

@_date: 2017-11-13 13:27:00
I tried to, but the bastards in localbitcoins.com in india didn't decrease the price at all. Even when the price dipped to around Rs. 3,60,000 ($5,523), the prices never fell below Rs. 4,40,000 ($6,751). No one was selling below this price. A few did sell below, but they were quickly removed and I am sure they must have increased the price immediately. Its nothing but a cartel right now. Someone with deep pockets is buying all the bitcoins, IMHO. Something needs to be done.
EDIT: Same shit was true for canadian bitcoins on localbitcoins.com. Looks the same people in both places are jacking up the prices. No prizes for guessing who.

This won't make you rich OP. Already people would be converting their bolivars into USD or BTCs. Selling your BTCs for worthless bolivar or high valued USD won't happen. No one will part with their USD as it is highly acceptable currency (compared to other currencies). And there is no reason to suspect that bolivar won't slide further, eroding your profits.
But, if you are a local gang with gun and muscle power to trade across the borders, you can make use of this opportunity to smuggle USD across borders and make huge profits.

Though the price of Bitcoin will hit the moon, the old farts hate that they don't have any control over the entire process. Traditional banking system is completely under their control. They can close anyone's account, charge any fees, launder money etc etc. They loose control over others and hence it is unacceptable to them 
The smart investors will invest in Bitcoins and reap benefits. But the traditional ones will not accept it. Either the people adopt Bitcoins whole heatedly and banks will be forced to accept it, or we have to wait for them to retire.

It is not that difficult to figure out actually. Not that I would recommend such behaviour. Just look at the quotes.


You can hack the passport office of us/india and get the details of all the software engineers coming to us during such period. Secondly, it would not be difficult to find out which company he is working as they have to mention it in the visa as they are usually in HB1 visa.


Most likely from the area he worked/lived.


Okay, this is tough. Rahul is a very common name in india.


Not very informative, but still something to go on with.


This is easy to find out. The Ministry of External Affairs maintains a list of expats returning to india.
Not to forget that there will be a transaction of 20,000 BTCs somewhere between 2010 and 2012. And no other transactions there.
As you can see, it is not impossible. Give me access to certain travel records, visa/passport records, work records, rent records of that area, etc etc you can trace. I am not interested nor do I give a shit about someone who became rich by "luck" (I'm not disparaging his achievement. His previous lives' karma must be good to get this much money.) But he can be traced if I were to work in a govt agency like FBI/CIA etc with resources and links. Hence my point is valid.
EDIT: And tripura really is a small and poor state. I'm sure he is already a mini-celebrity there. Going to us is a dream for many parents. Not that difficult to figure out. Of course, one should not try to dox him though.

They are correct. Just that they aren't practical.


Your public key will be on the blockchain if you spend your bitcoins. If there is a time lag between transaction being broadcasted and being confirmed, powerful quantum computers can decode the private key and rebroadcast to another address.

How many though?
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:58:25
Wait till the chill manufacturers get monopoly, then you see the price they charge. It is the same with miners. The equipment is going to become too expensive and complicated for normal people to get. Would lead just a handful of large miners being able to mine. Then, they will start increasing fees.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:12:15


Not if there are very few super high tech guys in the field. But we never know.
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:45:35
So, the first transaction has to happen at least one block before the current transaction's block right? Or can both the different transactions happen in the same block?
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:44:04


That won't work on pcs that run on cd or pen drive based OS right?

@_date: 2017-09-19 07:41:14
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:59:53


Okay. That is why it was confusing. You can see this address having 3 transactions while having zero balance (after the first 2). It was confusing. Now it is clear. 
Anyway, this seems to be a very good way to launder money. No intermediary and no minimum time to wait before you can perform transactions again. Someone sure is benefiting from blockchain technology.

Can't set it to zero though.
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:00:33
Well, they are still going to get 12.5 bitcoins for each block(for a few years). In fact if all nodes start rejecting transactions because of 0 fees, then one of the best features of bitcoin i.e. free transactions, will be lost.

@_date: 2017-10-10 21:02:34
Here's a piece of advice OP: don't tell anyone you used to mine or that there are bitcoins stored on your old HDDs. Just take one by one and search for the wallet.dat or whatever file it was stored in. And buy a hardware wallet. Better to be safe than sorry.
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:23:43


This is the reason why I think that bitcoin will remain as a high valued, high risk, nerdy investment. You can't have currency's value fluctuate everyday and expect it to be used to buy things.
But the good news is that that possibility is far, far off. By the time that happens, the value of 1 BTC might be $1-10 million. It would be too expensive for anyone to buy even a sathoshi.
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:28:58
Can the real satoshi please stand up?
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:56:14
Well, then what you are saying is not relevant to what I was saying. Some people can easily move their money outside most countries of the world.
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:07:10
The costlier the mining equipments get, the longer it will take as miners won't bother with 0 fees.
On the side, how long before the transaction is removed from the mempool and I can do the same transaction again with higher fees, without double spending?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:09:15
You just broke bitcoins.^^/s
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:25:56
Let me understand this and correct me if I'm wrong:
Bitcoin transactions are only movement between one address to another right? So, the only way I can own bitcoins is if the private key used to encrypt the transaction is held exclusively by me? Then why not re-create the private key using the private 12/24 word seed every time I am transacting, rather than storing it in a wallet? This would save it from ever being stolen, if I commit the seed word to memory and don't tell anyone?
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:30:59
I doubt it. Life extension technologies or immortality is the only thing that would be on people's minds when they invent time machine. Even though they could move back and forth in time or have 10^77 dollars, their aging won't stop.

Well, I don't really judge people anymore. There is no way to prove that he had the coins or that he didn't just create another wallet and transfer it there and is bamboozling us. I just like to read the stories so that we learn more about the how careless people are with their money.

And that is what bitcoin was supposed to avoid. If you like to have your btcs under some govt agency's gaze, you are free to do so. I would advice to avoid it at all costs. When the govt finally decides that the btcs are legal or illegal, in both cases the IT dept is going to knock on people's doors (or wallets). This is precisely what bitcoin seeks to avoid. No one should know how much and where you have your coins, IMHO.

@_date: 2017-10-23 15:52:32
It could be. ECDSA is more prone to getting cracked than RSA is. But it would take a tremendous amounts of computational power. Shor's algo just don't work properly in its current form. Someone needs to modify it.

About time the hardware wallets come in bitcoin shape gold case.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:02:35
This precisely is the biggest weakness and strength of bitcoin. You can literally move all your life's savings in a sec. And could loose it too. Now people being what they are and how used-to to the undo transaction people they are, they are not going to accept loosing bitcoins over just a simple error or a malware.
And second is extreme technical nature of it compared to other medium. So, overall bitcoin could hit a huge value but I doubt there will be widespread acceptance of it any time soon. But we never know what will happen in the future.

Most people don't use bitcoins or have heard of it, but are rich and are getting rich everyday.

But there are a few things to keep in mind. They say on their website that they track their user's bitcoins. If it comes or goes to dubious sources they can block or call the police.
And you have to give your ID to some corporate dudes. Definitely not good. They are going to pass the info to the IT dept. If bitcoin sores, IT dept is surely going to ask them for info.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:08:56
Looks like everyone now knows what hardfork is. The jump in price was most probably due to people putting their extra cash in the blockchain. Now they are pulling out and it is crashing the price.
This should not be a problem for HODLs though.

A few methods can be used to take over Bitcoins.
Solving elliptic curve cryptography will make all bitcoins yours. But people will just shift to another safer curve.
Creating a powerful quantum computer will allow you to take over Bitcoins. But people can switch to quantum computer resistant algo.
But the last method of guessing private keys can't be fought back. We can just hope that it doesn't happen to us.
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:48:54

The OP was clearly talking about india's poverty and rape problem. But other countries have those problems too. And they aren't the reasons why bitcoins should not be developed.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:14:48
A few:
* It will never have mass adoption as people think it will. It might hit $1 trillion per bitcoin but never will 7.6 billion people use it, like cash. The reasons are as follows:
* Its too technical to use. Blockchain, transaction, confirmation, double spend, ECDSA, exponent etc etc are too technical for most people. I think most people here are from the western countries where there is huge amount of literacy and day to day usage of technology. In third world countries, other than the cities most are still in dark ages. You will die before you can explain them the concept of bitcoin to them. And since majority of the people in the world live in third world, it will never have major acceptance on the scale that cash and gold are.
* It can be stolen and not reverted back. Even if people understand the concept, when they find out that it can't be reverted is going to piss them off. Most people are too poor to recover from the shock. Some would be too pissed to use it again. The concept of loosing bitcoin is like loosing your cash. But you cash can be recovered. Not the same with bitcoins. Once people realize this, forget about mass acceptance in third world countries. Even a rupee or a dollar is too much to loose for some.
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:45:27

@_date: 2017-10-22 06:48:29
I don't want any BTCs. I was just wondering if people here have so much money, they should show some appreciation.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:21:40
I don't think a distributed decentralized system can come with "relative ease". The reason it is so technical is because it is independent of centralized control. Trying to simplify it will make it centralized. And since the power of bitcoin is decentralization, it will never be simple enough for most people to use it. The risk will always remain and if people do get into and start loosing money, it is back to square one. People will rather not loose money than earn more money.

You wouldn't. Doesn't mean others won't. But really awesome technical stuff. The more bitcoin goes in value, the more shitz like this will become common.

But you won't have the private keys for the *actual* bitcoins right? If so, then its just banks using blockchain for their internal transactions.

Its a lot TBH. Removing the intermediaries like banks really brings down prices. Who knew?
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:46:57
AFAIK, the elliptic curve cryptography is easily broken by the quantum computers. The RSA ones will simply move to higher bit keys. There is a theory going around that secp256k1 is broken by the CIA and hence that is why it is used in bitcoin. CIA either has a backdoor mathematical formula to solve the problem, or already has quantum computers to break them. Either case, bitcoins will be hacked sooner or later.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:07:19
It is one thing to use your riches to buy nice things, another to rub it into people's faces that you are rich. At that point, your happiness is derived from other's misery. That's a sign of a disturbed mind who takes pleasure in other's suffering. There are millions of rich people who are happy and content and don't show off. But there are some who have to show the world that they are rich and offend people. So, my comment was directed at such people, not rich people in general.

I hope that would be backward compatible, as a lot of addresses have not spent a dime for a few years.


Then it makes it even more valuable to hold btcs than spend them on goods. Anything you buy, won't be able to keep up with its value. It will keep happening till it hits peak. Then it could be a medium of exchange. Till then, just an investment.

This work around will become extremely complicated when there are thousands seeking to buy sell in real time. The apps have to be synced with the servers, which in turn will be synced with another user for a transaction to be accepted and completed. Simpler would be fight for right to buy/sell bitcoins. If people are using their white money and submitting their adhaar for gods sake, what is the problem that the govt has?
The problem of course is the fucking banking dynasty.

Yes but the question is whether it really is good or not. There were people in the 90s who thought that computers were piece of shit. And then there were people who thought that this was the future. We all now know who was right. So, nothing wrong with believing if it is the right thing.
@_date: 2019-09-04 08:43:02

@_date: 2017-10-22 08:23:56
Okay. I also think similar. But I do think the value needs to peak somewhere if it has any chance to become a real currency IRL.
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:10:35


Then don't make judgement about others when they say that value is increasing or decreasing. You may have made lots of money with it. Maybe you are even a millionaire/billionaire/trillionaire etc etc. But the point remains that its value is increasing and will continue to do aso as the supply won't ever match the demand.
Also, which part of the world can you just swipe your card and buy shitz for btcs?

No not really. Although the currency part shows good programming skills, the crypto part has been known long before he wrote the white paper. In fact, if anyone needs to be credited, it is the mathematicians who "discovered" elliptic curve properties and modulo arithmetic. Modern cryptography and computer science in general would not have developed without those. So much of mathematics is behind crypto that it is a subject in itself. Those people never get the credit for the software/services developed on it.
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:52:55
Get a new laptop. Do not connect it to wi-fi ever. Use that to create 10-15 wallets in electrum. Then sign transactions from this computer using pen drive, keeping your bitcoins secure.

There is no technology in the world that isn't hackable. Even if trezor is safe now, we don't know about the future. Having an air gapped pc is the safest way to go for now.
@_date: 2018-07-28 08:00:07
Actually I think that it is a great move. ETFs will stabilize the crypto's price movement. It can finally move to the second phase in currency development: store of value. Once that is done, we can finally use it as a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:16:09

Actually, a quantum computer can beat bitcoin's cryptography in polynomial time. Its just that such computers have not been built yet. secp256k1 is especially vulnerable to shor's algorithm. RSA isn't vulnerable to quantum computing, interestingly.
And lets not forget that there is always the possibility of someone solving the secp258k1 curve for Q = d * G1. Its not a safe curve.

The same reason why everyone is using smartphones nowadays. Just 10 years ago having a smart phone was a luxury. Now the opposite is true. Once crypto currencies are known to people, they will want more of it and it will create demand and since supply is limited, the price will eventually rise.

I doubt they are idiots. They know full well what they are doing. Their masters (banks and media) don't like crypto. It erodes their power.

@_date: 2019-05-18 10:11:15
TBH, there is no inherent intrinsic *monetary* value of anything in the world. We have just assumed to give something a monetary value to prevent from dealing in barter system. The monetary value of an object does not mean anything about the real value of that object.
Case in example, indian real estate market. The price is jacked up 10-15 times in major cities for no other reason than all the corrupt and powerful have their stakes in development. Everyone is poaching off the middle class buying their first homes and no one is doing anything. That does not mean that the value of an apartment is that much. It just means that so many people are going to give that much price for it and there is no regulation.
Same with bitcoins. Right now the only source about bitcoins is media for most people. They keep spreading fud and hence each fud cycle there is price fluctuation.

TBH, east european countries are being used to channel all the stolen bitcoins. About time they do something about it.

I read his/her response and frankly it seems like a person who doesn't know much about bitcoins. I expected them to do some research before saying why they weren't making such a video, but they just seem as clueless as others about bitcoins.

Some people have said that this guy owns hundreds of thousands of bitcoins. Used to give hundreds away to people.
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:43:43
Also, I'd like to add a few points:
* People will not accept the fact that the transactions are irreversible. People are used to having banks reverse their transactions or atleast hope that someone will refund their money. No such thing on bitcoins.
* Its too technical for most people.
* Once people start loosing their keys like they do their passwords, people will get pissed.
* Its too easy to scam or phish people into giving up their keys.

The financial system is very well co-ordinated. I think they have brought the same shit to bitcoins. I think they are considering this their new gold.
For those from india, I remember when icici bank and others were promoting sips a few years back. The financial sites and newspaper were calling it the greatest thing in the country. Markets crashed 6 months later. All middle class people were stuck in the market for years even before they could get even. I remember because my dad put a *lot* of his money in it and is still to recover the principal amount. The co-ordination between the media and the corporations is done with surgical precision. These guys know what they are doing. Now they are doing the same with bitcoins. Just don't fall for these assholes' claims.
@_date: 2018-12-20 02:05:11
Didn't effect me much personally. But the lower class got fucked big time. Many people died waiting in line to withdraw cash. The bankers and CAs made lots of money. The corrupt people got their cash converted easily. 99% of the money returned to the banking system. The whole thing was the worst experiment in the history of experiments but the govt doesn't seem to care.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:47:51
You have bought at a good price. But the question is do you have the balls of steel to hold onto them during the price fluctuations?

More like: bitcoins are *only* used for money laundering, child porn, drugs and other illegal activities.
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:08:12
rbi has banned all banks from dealing in crypto. IT dept is breathing down the necks of people who have made gains. Finance Minister has called bitcoin not a legal tender. The police have interpreted this is as illegal and people are getting harassed for even holding bitcoins. So, I'd say not good.

I have bought at lower prices with whatever money I could save here and there. But the majority of my investments have been at the ATH only.

What stops them from just adding some random value in someone's account?
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:18:43
As a guy who got into bitcoins when it was ATH, I have no regrets. The knowledge I gained has convinced me that this is going to be here for time to come.
A payment system which does not need anyone's permission to work is the need of the hour. People just don't know it yet. Previous generation have been through the stock market crash and the gold seizures. Our generation hasn't seen anything drastic. Once that happens, people will realize the value of crypto currencies. Till then, let them stick with fiat.

Huh? Hash rate is no. of tries that a miner does per second. Difficulty is the target below which the block hash should be. They are correlated. Higher the hash rate, higher the difficulty. Lower the hash rate, lower the difficulty.
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:31:43
IMHO, the best way to learn is by doing. Goto an exchange where you own your keys. Then buy a tiny amount of bitcoins. Then see your addresses and balance. Then goto a blockchain explorer and see which address has sent you the bitcoins and how much. Learn about the transaction and fees and other details. Look a little into the blockchain and then read shit and you will understand better.

Thanks to Bitcoins, I learnt python, JavaScript, ECC, ECDSA, cryptography, hashing algorithms, block chain parsing, signing transactions, exponent to private key to public key to address conversion, reading/writing blocks on file  etc etc
On the financial side I learnt that financial markets are full of FUDs, banks are scared of crypto, Indian govt is corrupt as fuck as they have banned almost banned crypto, most people who write about crypto on main stream media are idiots or paid shrills etc etc

The problem with such things is that once they figure it out, either they will make technical changes to remove this or you are getting sued.

But even the poorest person knows how to keep cash safe.


Unfortunately, not knowing your private keys can be a big disadvantage.


Even if they don't get their money back, they have some hope that somehow they can get it. It literally won't happen in bitcoins, unless  someone is kind enough to donate.

As a guy who bought at near ATH, don't get overly excited when you see huge gains. I did not sell when my net worth fell 95%. Just chill for the next 5 years or so.

LOL. Of course not. The charges are on each deposit/withdrawal.
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:19:48


And people use care and have all the methods to keep them safe. Not everyone would do that with bitcoins at first.


That's because they don't directly create and send packets on ipv6. But if they don't learn at least something about the bitcoin and how it works, they have a huge chance of loosing their deposits.


But people still have courts and social media to goto. No such chance for bitcoins.

Whoever the client is, must be loaded. At $9K per bitcoin and 17.7m btcs in circulation that's around $159 billion. Of course if they really start buying it the price is going to shoot up. But still, someone looking to invest upward of $100 billions in bitcoins means that rich people want to acquire it. They just can't FOMO us enough to drop the price low enough.

In India we have cash handling charges. You have to pay money to the bank to deposit or withdraw cash from your own account.
