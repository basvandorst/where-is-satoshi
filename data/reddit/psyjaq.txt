Thanks for the reply, but I want to own a whole bitcoin someday haha. Maybe Ill start with getting a small fraction.

What the deal with this technique? Does it mean that my buying price will approach the real average buying price after time?

I really wanna buy a bitcoin, but its quite some money, so I hope that there will be massive price drop to 150euros in the next few months/years.

Ok, so what I got out of this thread is that I should NOT set up a wallet (for example on coinbase) if I do not have a computer which has never been online. 
My next question is HOW do I encrypt my wallet? Everyone talks about how important it is, but no one tells how you do that...

Haha thats a good question, lets say I want to see it crash and recover after a while.

So how much is a bitcoin in the moment and dont you think bitcoins can be risky as the government will try to regulate it?
Edit: I found the bitcoin price myself lol

Thank you so much for your answer and your tip!!!
You literally just made my day since those are my first bitcoins (I know its not a full one), I just connected my reddit account with changetip, is that already a wallet???
Id like to open a wallet on coinbase since their site looks really nice lol but I will definately check out electrum as well thanks for the suggestions!
I just looked up my email account and I couldnt find anything saying something about Two-Factor-Authentication, I guess the term means that I always have to authorize a transaction through more than one medium right?

Thanks for all your answers, I probably wont ever dump my entire savings into bitcoins as no one knows how much worth it will be in 10 years.
I think the thread popps up when you search for the term 'bitcoin' in the search field. If not then I found it on the bitcoin subreddit.

If it was up to me, the bitcoin price would drop to 250$ so I can finally afford a whole bitcoin. God dammit, I wish I had bought some in January 2013.

So how come PayPal doesnt require me to basically tell them everything about me except my blood type but all those bitcoin sites like coinbase want it????

Yeah, true its because people are greedy and think 'maybe it will fall even more!'
