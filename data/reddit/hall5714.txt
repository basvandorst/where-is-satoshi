That's what I was responding to, moron. It isn't "free". It's certainly more cost-effective in areas that are colder and have cheap energy. But it sure as hell isn't "free". 
People don't buy electrical heaters because they are the most cost-effective thing in existence. Utilizing that heat always will be. But the expense of your brilliant plan is that you have virtually zero actual control of the temperature of the room. You have no means of dispersing the heat throughout the house without significant heat loss. So if you want your 1000 square foot, 20 degree house to be 70 degrees, you'll need some 16,000 watts of power to generate the 55,000 BTU's necessary to heat the home, and THAT assumes you'll disperse the wattage room by room. 
So you'll only need to buy 10 Antminer S9's plus PSU's at a cost of $30,000 in order to have your amazing miner-heated house. But hey, I'm "bad with math" while you're the genius that's figured out with a low $30,000 investment, you'll never pay for heat again!
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:18:20


No, I'm saying the dudes PC pulling 600 watts is negligible on the heat of the house, because that doesn't produce enough heat to do anything but dissipate. 


Of course, all of that is true *in a closed system*. Anyone that's used a mining rig, ever, has seen an increase in their electrical bill overall. That's because the heat is lost prior to it affecting the temperature of the room, via a window, door, or other external fixture.
Quebec has summer highs of around 80 degrees. So you end up with a shitty trade-off: If you have enough miners to actually help offset the heat bill, you'll need to cool it in the summer. If you have so few that the impact is negative (due to heat dissipation), it's moot because you still have an increased electrical bill.


Yes, if you manage to create the perfect system in which you manage the heat and cold perfectly such that you'll produce enough heat to actually offset your thermostat and never produce so much that you have to use an A/C, you've got a cost-free system. But nobody is going to find that balance. The more heat you add to offset your heating bill, the more you need to cool.
And go fuck yourself about the degree. This jackass says I'm bad at math. I'm not, I'm just not stupid enough to think you can add heat to a system that offsets your heating bill, without having a cost that at least offsets it when cooling. 
Basic fucking fundamentals. Yes, you could manage to work this out. The odds that you will pull the exact wattage to generate enough heat that the thermostat will actually read, without needing any A/C to offset it in the summer is very close to zero. It's stupid, but feel free to be stupid with your money.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:24:07
Yeah, until it's summer and now you need to cool your massive heat-producing PC's. So, let's assume you built enough PC's to turn 50 degree whether into 70, making your house nice and comfy. Now assuming a 1:1 ratio (which it isn't, but it's close enough), once the exterior temperature is 90 degrees, you're computers are making it 110, which you now need to cool back down to 70.
It isn't paying for itself.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:53:51
Your PC is drawing 600 watts maybe. That'll generate 2000 BTU/hour which would barely heat a fucking closet. 9 square feet, to be exact. You're computer also can't mine Bitcoin, unless you point it at a pool and then wait 5 years to generate enough Bitcoin to actually get paid out.
My CS degree and this conversation says I'm pretty good at math, and you're fucking bad at basic common sense, let alone math.

Bitcoin is open. You can make a Bitcoin miner today if you like, you'll just end up spending more money than you make. In order to make money, you'll need to either build (and feel free to release the specs/design/software if you like) or buy a piece of hardware that makes mining profitable.
I have no idea what the hell you are ranting about. The software that's important IS open source, thus you or anyone else can make the appropriate software to mine. How about, instead of bitching, you fund a new miner?

They aren't the same thing. E2E tests are testing an entire application, integration tests are testing the integration between units, so the scale is significantly smaller.
Now, as a software engineer you should know test *count* is meaningless. What matters is coverage, not count. The Lightning integration tests are testing 6 API calls and 1 test to make sure all the nodes start up. That's it. The whole point of the tests are to see if the 3 major LN implementations can all chat with each other in a predictable way.
There are 3 major implementations, as I stated. That means the majority of the API calls have 9 potential configurations (A -&gt; A, A -&gt; B, ... C -&gt; A), etc. So 9*5 = 45 integration tests. One of the 7 tests is just testing that the nodes successfully start, so there's only 3. 45 + 3 = 48. Finally, there's a test for a forwarded transaction (A -&gt; A -&gt; B, etc). That requires 27 total tests (3^3 possible configuration). 48 + 27 = 75.
There's exactly the number of integration tests there needs to be. No more, no less.

@_date: 2017-12-06 23:52:28
Why? The whole point of testing these features is purely to test interoperability. The entire LN API is comprised of 6 external “commands” and the rest is internal to that particular implementation.
And yes, there is an agreed upon definition of integration tests. It’s testing groups of units. In this case the units are the individual implementations of LN.

The overwhelming majority of Bitcoin holders are none of those things. It's a $4.6B market cap. You think that's mostly owned by tiny minority political ideologies?


Banking is vastly further from it. Centralized control of trade and commerce is the literal definition of anti\-left. That's the problem with unrestricted capitalism, it always results in consolidation until there remains so little competition \(and so little ability to create competition\) that the companies wield absolute power. Libertarianism absolutely supports the idea of complete consolidation of power via unregulated markets. In a Libertarian market, banks would be allowed to merge without restriction resulting in a single entity that wields absolute control. Doing so with Bitcoin would be too costly \(without controlling the supply or having significant power over it's process\).

It isn't defendable because it isn't consensus. Miners don't get to hard fork. They are only refusing replay protection out of fear that it won't work, and thus, become yet another Bitcoin alt. The recent addition of opt-in protection was undoubtedly in hopes that the major exchanges support 2x.

I'd say you're an idiot. Nodes don't update quickly because they require explicitly downloading them. That's been the case for years, vastly longer than any discussion regarding segwit2x.


It isn't a "simple upgrade". There's been one fucking hard fork in the *entire history* of Bitcoin, and that was 7 years ago and *completely* uncontentious.
All of that ignores the fact that the *overwhelming majority* of the Bitcoin dev community doesn't feel that a block size increase is necessary right this second, particularly since the goal is to wait and see what segwit does for the mempool. 
Now, what's clear to me, is you're full of shit when you said you understand "every line of code" for Bitcoin. The only time a hard fork was used was to protect Bitcoin. Everyone agreed to its necessity. The hard fork has support of the majority of hash power, a minority of companies (both unweighted and weighted by volume) and a significant minority of users. That's not a contentious hard fork.

Jesus you have no idea what you are talking about. At any time a LN transaction can be broadcast on the Blockchain. Furthermore at some point it's bound to happen if you want to transact on chain with any funds received from LN transactions. That is the definition of an unbroadcast tx, not value derived from another source. In fact that fails to meet the basic definition of "derived". 
I didn't knock Bitcoin cash, nor do I care to. The only reasons to transact on chain are the same reasons you'd broadcast a transaction on LN. The point being, if I send you 1 Bitcoin today and you send me 1.3 in 3 months, there's absolutely no valid reason to broadcast the initial transaction. The source of the Bitcoin remains the same, the only difference is we pay a transaction fee one way instead of two.

This true, but the latter point isn't arguable: Gold is used in such small quantities in electronics most of them aren't even worth recycling anymore. Eventually other materials with similar conductivity and stability will replace gold.
Gold was still extremely valuable prior to its industrial use cases and will continue to do so due to perceived value. Which is why this guy is a moron.

Segwit is a solution that combines a malleability bug fix with increased block size all without a hard fork. It's the only solution that did all 3.
UTXO growth *should* remain as constant as possible. Wanting faster UTXO *growth* is retarded. Why would you want the primary validation database to actually be larger? Avoiding that is how we avoid node centralization. The UTXO database can be any 2 of large, decentralized and fast. 
Bottom line, your primary implication is wrong, and even if it was correct it's moot because UTXO growth rate isn't a good thing for decentralization, and because of that your later point is absolutely moot.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:44:29
You clearly don't understand. LN fees are going to be insanely low, and LN on a non-Segwit alt has some major hurdles that the BCH team is neither capable or qualified to implement.

@_date: 2017-08-24 20:57:20
The GUI's aren't different at all. LN wallets that don't abstract it away are because they haven't entirely implemented the spec yet. There's still some issues with LN, and the spec may change so engineering investment in an API that may turn out very different when live isn't a good thing.

Only a fool calls caution dogma. There is a big block chain and a segwit chain now, the fact that we'll potentially have 3 coins is entirely the fault of the miners.


Segwit didn't cause a chain split, stop acting like an idiot. BCH hard forked, and they did so properly by including replay protection. JeffCoin is attempting to hard fork without appropriate protections. Nobody cares about it.


Devs have to centrally plan. It's a fucking software application. It's not the fault of the core devs that the reference client is used by the overwhelming majority of the community. We are leaving this to the market. The market dictates which client it installs and it's *overwhelmingly* chosen the core client.
You're claims of centralization are a joke. It's easy to switch software, but only a tiny fraction of the community has because the alternatives (including JeffCoin) is absolute shit. Throw your fits all you want, you aren't going to dictate Bitcoin and neither are the miners. The market does that.

We all will. The fact that you seem so sure of yourself is a problem. The miners have *proven* they will chase profitability. That's good, that's intended. Miners cannot mine a chain that has no value because they will go bankrupt. This isn't a complex issue.


You assume intent = engagement. Just because 90% of miners are saying they will do something, doesn't mean they will. And even assuming they do, it won't be for a long period of time if they can't sell the coins.


It can survive for a very long time short of a network attack.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:55:03
Mining is considered self-employment so the floor is $400 a year. You *also* pay capital gains on the increased value. So if you mine 1 BTC and it's worth $3000 you pay straight income tax on it. If it increases to $4000, you pay income tax on $3000 and capital gains on $1000.  The latter applies to purchasing as well.

Lol how fucking stupid. SPV nodes will upgrade if your chain becomes Bitcoin after the fork. The only reason not to implement replay protection is to attack the network. 
BCH devs had faith in their fork, so they implemented protections for their users. JeffCoin wants to make a hash power hard fork work because it's the only way it will be adopted.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:57:30
Jesus, you honestly need me to spell this out? Segwit is a scaling solution, so is LN. Block size increases are entirely unnecessary right now. Let segwit activate, watch the mempool for a while, and if we need more scaling, *then* scale. You don't preemptively increase block size. That's pointless and increases the attack vector surface area.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:51:09
That isn't impossible that is literally how it works. If I buy a Bitcoin for $2000 and the FMV is $3000 I've increased my net worth by $1000 simply by buying something. I have to pay capital gains on $1000.
FMV is *literally* a single number. In the case of Bitcoin there's no standard formula, but for any other asset it's the average price paid at a given point in time. If I pay $2000 at Kracken but across all exchanges the price is $3000 average I've literally made money instantly upon purchase.
You called that impossible when it absolutely isn't. It's so common there are industries built on it, which is why the term FMV exists. Purchase price != FMV and as such, you can increase your net worth simply by buying something. So you're incorrect. Again.

This is wrong. This isn't about artificial scarcity it's about soft forks generally being preferable to hard forks for a variety of reasons. The scarcity isn't artifical, because if that were true than we could arbitrarily raise it tomorrow without consequence. There would be consequences, thus it's not artificial. 
Nobody uses LTC, so it stands to reason nobody uses LN on LTC. LN, side chains and larger blocks are all scaling solutions and they will all be utilized at one point or another. There's no reason to press the big red button right now. This has always been the process for big block supporters: minimize how big of a deal hard forks are and the rest doesn't matter.
There's been one hard fork in the history of BTC. It was entirely agreeable and without it BTC would have died. This is a contentious hard fork with little planning on a network that is many factors larger than it was when the last hard fork occurred.

You know a programming language, that doesn't mean you understand the code, it means you can read it.
If you understood the code you'd recognize why a 3 month prep for a hard fork with no replay protection that's intended to be the real Bitcoin is fucking insane. Nodes don't upgrade that fast. Which is why btc1 represents something akin to 1% of available nodes.
This is not consensus and this is not how smart engineers upgrade something of this much value. That's why Garzik and the rest of the btc1 devs kept having to fix issues core devs pointed out.

No one gives a shit about indiciations. People signed a non-binding piece of fucking paper. Replay protection is implemented by the forking chain because nobody knows what the minority chain will be until they split.
There is one chain. You want to make a second chain you need to protect the users. But miners don't give a shit about anything but control.

You are assuming you know something you don't know anything about. The capital cost is only high if you constantly disconnect channels and reopen them. Long term channels are vastly more likely.

Orphaning blocks intentionally isn't enforcing a protocol level change, it's attacking the network. And that in no way requires 51% hash power, increased hash power only increases the probability of success.

Only when a single group holds progress hostage. There was literally no reason to prevent segwit outside of the fact that miners utilized BIP9 as a means to control.  That's never going to happen again, I'd guess, as Core will likely use BIP8 from now on.

Come on man. *All plans have hard limits*. Do you know how large the block chain would have to be to support transaction volume like Visa? Pure centralization. LN, segwit, side chains and block size are all part of the solution. 
Once again, we don't even need a block size increase now and segwit has not even activated yet, there is no LN and no side chains. The appropriate way to handle this is wait for segwit, and if we need to scale beyond that, plan and implement slowly.

The anology is a joke. You compared Blockstream to a bank entirely to direct the narrative of the anology, not because it was fair. Intentions and behavior are *all* that matter because everything else is unknown. Their behavior has never warranted suspicion so monkeys like you attack their intentions and then question their ability to defend their intentions.
There is no conflict of interest. The project is open source, meaning anyone can audit it, and lead by someone funded by MIT. I agree with hat false dichotomies are tools of the weak minded, which is why I avoid them. I did here too, but I suppose someone who compares banks to software companies may find it difficult to understand when to use their $3.00 words.
I don't care about the rail road, I care about Bitcoin development. Fortunately for us, the entire code base can be audited by anyone unlike any bank I'm aware of. They don't have to be entirely unbiased when anything they do as core devs is public record.
The fact that you aren't skilled enough to review their work doesn't mean their work isn't vastly more independent due to its open nature.
What I truly find amazing is that people like you are perfectly content with the largest hash rate miner *also* funding core alternatives, but some company developing on top of the block chain deserves absolute distrust based entirely on suspicion rather than actual acts.

No, *that* point is moot. Miners don't hard fork, they mine the most profitable chain. 2x is presently worth $0.00 and will likely always be worth $0.00 because none of the exchanges have agreed to list it.

Not very fucking long.

You don't understand what 51% attacks can do. It enables double spends. You can't double spend until a transaction is confirmed. If it takes a ton of time to confirm it, the attack becomes more expensive and less impactful. 


You can blacklist the nodes that are double spending. No it's not even a remotely permanent solution, but it becomes a cat and mouse game that slows the progress of the attack.




Half wrong. It is an arbitrary number. Anyone chooses is technically correct but isn't how anyone actually uses Bitcoin. Transactions with less than 6 confirmations will show unconfirmed by the client. This is what almost every piece of software looks for when it determines whether at transaction is confirmed (unless it was implemented by morons that hard-coded 6).
Does it "solve" 51%? No... the world doesn't work that way. It protects against, it doesn't solve. Nothing solves a 51% besides a PoW change.
As for two, it's a very temporary solution to a problem. It helps mitigate, but like 1 it doesn't solve.

No, it's not about honesty. Bitcoin leverages greed to incentive consistency. Being "honest" is moot. If you aren't consistent (ie, follow consensus rules) you don't get paid.


You keep putting in "honest" where it doesn't exist. That's why we constantly use the term "trustless" and not "honest". Honesty doesn't matter, at all. 


That literally means nothing. Miners follow the appropriate consensus because if they don't, they orphan their blocks and lose money. Literally the only fucking thing miners do is follow timestamps. The hell are you talking about honesty for? They either follow timestamps and get paid, or don't follow timestamps and don't get paid. This isn't rocket science and it isn't honesty.

My point was that signaling isn't meaningful, because signaling &lt;&gt; hash rate. Your constant claim that "we have 95% hash rate" was instantly proven wrong when F2Pool pulled out.


Again: sample size of 1 means shit.


Because it was *in their best interests to do so*. Period. If a miner is signaling something for a month preceding a hard fork, and that hard fork looks less and less like it's going to be in their best interest, they will pull out. Period.
If Coinbase were to pull out of NYA and not support the hard fork, it would completely destroy Segwit2x and the miners would absolutely pull out. That's why signaling means shit. That's why hash rate means shit. In the end, it can change in an instant. And *that* is why miners can't hard fork.

That is just dead wrong. There's no honesty requirement at all. The entire system is built around the idea that they don't have to be honest. 


Again, you have no idea what you are talking about. They aren't proving their honesty, they are simply following the protocol, because there are costs associated with not following it. Failure to follow the consensus could potentially lead to orphaning your found blocks, which in turn results in you losing money. It has zero to do with honesty, in fact, it's entirely based on greed.


Again, you are using words in a way that makes absolutely no sense to *anyone* with *any* familiarity with what Bitcoin is. You don't change PoW because of dishonesty. The *only* reason you'd ever change it is to stop a 51% attack. Keep in mind, that a 51% attack in of itself is not self-serving: it has a cost and damages the value of the very network you are trying to make money from.
You need to quit while you're behind. "Honesty" doesn't exist in Bitcoin because it's not required. The underlying driver behind Bitcoin is **greed**, not honesty. And fortunately, greed is a great motivator. Honesty rarely is.

If they choose the 2x chain and they are wrong and sell a shitcoin as "Bitcoin" the value loss to their customers would be astronomical. When a company is negligent with a customers funds, that company becomes financially responsible for those losses. 
This is the problem with idiots that think companies are crazy evangelists like they are. Coinbase is a multi-billion dollar company. Like any multi-billion dollar company they will *never* take an entirely unnecessary risk. The moment Coinbase pulls out, btc1 is dead, and merging the commit that makes btc1 report that it's the Core client almost *certainly* ensures that Coinbase is going to do exactly that.

Nobody is dismissing miners. The idea that miners and a few businesses get to decide what Bitcoin is, is the problem. Segwit didn't activate for 2 years because miners held it hostage, and ShapeShift, Coinbase and Blockchain all decided to negotiate on everyone else's behalf, without agreement of any of your users, the core devs, the major crypto exchanges or the community.

Other way around. You have to prove the positive, explain why it's absolutely necessary. 


Hash power doesn't dictate hard forks, users do. And signaling means shit, which is proven by the fact that F2Pool is signaling, but publicly stated they aren't supporting it. And it's not 97%.


It's not a majority fork. This is a hard fork, the majority is the users.

Good thing Segwit2x doesn't have 95% hash rate! They have 95% signaling intent. The thing about that, as F2Pool has proven, intent means absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:39:50
Because they needed data from Segwit to determine when/how a 2MB hark fork should be implemented. Additionally, since it’s a scaling solution, they wanted to see if 18-24 months is even necessary. Finally, there’s some clean up required with Segwit since it was implemented as a soft fork, and doing so during a hard fork is the best available time.
This is why non-technical people, like you, that can not grasp the challenges involved in Bitcoin should *not* have an opinion on a technical matter. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:47:58
Bullshit. The majority of economic nodes will be running software that doesn't support the split. The reason they aren't including replay protection is because if they do, they'll destroy 2x. People will continue using the actual Bitcoin chain and 2x will be a worthless altcoin. Within a matter of days miners will return to the legacy chain.
2x is the ONLY thing that "pretty much ensures a split". All contentious hard forks ensure a split. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:04:41
Oh I would be happy to, just as soon as you guys stop claiming you have "95% of the hash rate". Because, just like it's pointless to have a debate on what will happen, it's pointless to claim you have support you do not.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:11:40
It’s not just a block size doubling, it’s a hard fork. Hard forks are only “no big deal” when they *aren’t* contentious. For the record, the only way to ask the market whether 2X has consensus is exactly what Bitfinex did. Thus far the market has determined that not only does it not have consensus, it doesn’t even have a majority.
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:54:34

@_date: 2017-10-03 15:46:49


Neither does this one since it has exactly 0 hash rate.


It doesn't.


Signaling and actual hash rate are not the same thing. F2Pool proved that.


Only if it's contentious.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:57:32


In order to stop the flagging they have to shut down the pool servers. That's insanely expensive, so unless there's an emergent reason to do so, they won't do it. They did it to flag Segwit because the UASF put a deadline on it. In this case they have until November.


In a perfectly distributed system, maybe. Unfortunately Bitcoins hash power is not distributed. 51% of the hash power is controlled by 5-6 people. But that's moot since miners were never intended to be the voting power behind Bitcoin.
This is the favorite line of 2X supporters from the whitepaper:


Great, clearly Satoshi was saying Miners control Bitcoin, right? No. He was talking about blockchain timestamping. 1 CPU = 1 Vote was literally about block orphaning and in *no way* was an indication that Miners should be voting on the implementation detail of Bitcoin. That's absolutely absurd... implementation should be left to the experts. 
But unfortunately, people don't understand the technical implications of having non-technical people (miners) making technical decisions. That's a terrible idea in rudimentary software. In security software it's an absolute disaster.
Bottom line is this: The *overwhelming* majority of the technical community is behind the current Bitcoin Core implementation. The *overwhelming* majority of people behind 2X have a financial interest in adaptation &gt; decentralization. Miners become billionaires if the world jumps on Bitcoin tomorrow, and if the cost of that is control they will *absolutely* jump on it.
And that's why the separation between the users and miners exist. Users choose the coin, miners choose the longest valid chain *on that coin*. That's it.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:40:40


Nice appeal to authority. "YOU CAN'T KNO BUSNESS UNLES YOU OWNS ONE". I have a degree in Computer Science, thus I know more than you on every aspect of the field. I mean... that's your logic, right?


Because it's fucking retarded to think that any business would ever take a risk *it has absolutely no need to take*. Coinbase is going to be very successful regardless of whether it follows 2X, so the safest bet is status quo. There's zero reason to follow it, since if it doesn't it effectively kills the HF altogether.

Impressive usage of facts and analysis here.


They signed and haven't said a word since. No implementation details, no dates, no nothing. And it's supposed to happen in 5 weeks.


There we go. Now I can get a better sense of how little you understand about Bitcoin. Hash power is not king, $ is. Miners are selfish, and they won't mine a worthless coin. THAT IS BITCOIN 101. Miners won't mine a coin where the transactions have no value. 


But you can include them in your "97%" of hash power bullshit (which was wrong anyway). 


So take F2Pool with a grain of salt... unless it reinforces your opinion.


LOL, the miners aren't going to leave Bitcoin for an altcoin that is worth $0.00. Period.

&lt; It's a vocal group that vehemently oppose either hardforks, or the idea of &gt;1mb as the maxblocksize despite the fact segwit already enables &gt;1mb effective size (and thus a null point, meaning the opposition is almost entirely just the idea of a hardfork upgrade)
They oppose rushed/contentious hard forks. I'm fine with a 2MB hard fork, I'm not fine with incompetent devs building it and running in 3 months. I'm not fine with miners being able to influence the code base as well as the mining. 


So, encourage a piece of software written by a tiny group of people, none of which even know the right variable that controlled the block weight? Yeah... no thanks.

The more I read comments from big blockers the more I recognize the majority of you are technically illiterate. Do you understand that Bitcoin has had a single hard fork in its history?

The exchanges will eventually publicly state that they won't list a coin without replay protection and Bitcoin2x will die just like ALL the other coins that came before it.
And you'll still be a fucking moron for thinking aggressively attacking another chain is going to happen without consequence. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:00:36


I have little tolerance for stupidity. 


Did I say "know nothing"? You used an appeal to authority, misquoted me and attacked that misquote. Then said "straw man". You don't understand what that means.


It was your claim I was responding to... 


You think they are going to wait until last minute for a contentious hard fork and then just start running btc1? 


You've ignored everyone that is vastly more technically skilled than you that's said otherwise.


Why would you assume it would be worth anything? No major exchanges support it. Coinbase/GDAX is it. The majority of the economy did not sign it.


I never said it would. But then again, I sold at $650 and now it's worth half that. It's usage has dropped to lower than it's been since it started and there is an empty mempool despite having nearly no hash power. It's just another shitcoin in a sea of them.


And still wrong since F2Pool pulled out. 84% intent (not hash power), and its still 5 weeks out.


Without the major exchanges 2x will go the way of BTU and all the other shitcoins. BCash was the only one that did it right: it tried to push the block size increase on its own and let the market decide. The market decided and BCash is not, nor will it ever be Bitcoin. I doubt 2X gets that far.

It's contentious because the experts in the field want time to actually research, test and implement features on a $100B network, not a completely pointless 3 month time frame demanded by people that have ONE interest: themselves. 
Nobody is going to say 2MB is a bad idea (aside from Luke) because there's nothing wrong with it. But right now, the dev team is focusing on other methods of scaling that don't rely on hard forks. Bitcoin has *never* had a hard fork, so they are (rightly) nervous about it given other options are available.
No, everyone else doesn't ignore which is why it's over 5x the size of (and that gap is getting *wider* over time).
Here's the reality: The technically illiterate are the ones supporting a dramatic, and unwisely paced upgrade to the network. You are in the minority, not the other way around.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:51:40
I'm not spending anything now, so why would I then? I sold the BCH shitcoin at near it's peak, I'll do close to the same with 2X when it becomes clear that you can't force users to install software and the miners move back to the real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:48:59
It's not a node, it's a pool server. The entire pool goes down when the pool server goes down. With F2Pools present hash rate, downtime costs them an estimate $450/minute. 
5-10 minutes is not a reasonable estimation because all of the mining nodes have to reconnect to the pool to go back to full hash power. But even assuming you're right you have two choices:
1) Take it down at an estimate $2000-$4000 cost.
2) Wait until you have an upgrade/maintenance window and do it then.
What would you do?
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:30:14
Doesn't matter. That's the problem with pretending hash rate and intention signaling are the same thing. They aren't. Which is why F2Pool's announcement on Twitter that they are no longer supporting NYA. Even if we assume every other miner continues to support it that's 83% support.
The problem is you are using intention signaling = hash rate. That's no different than saying node count signals user intent.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:45:54


Re-read it.
Miners target coins with the most profit. No profit, no mining, no Bitcoin. Without economic nodes, Bitcoin is worthless and miners can't convert their Bitcoin to fiat to support their multi-million dollar operations.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:42:35


The main reason these hard forks have *never* worked is because the exchanges have declined them without replay protection. That's why *no major exchanges* supported this. The Bitcoin economy is irrevocably tied to Bittrex/Bitfinex etc. The only reason this entire thing is alive today is entirely on Coinbase. They pull out, 2x is dead.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:36:17
Lol, and F2Pool made a decision to change their mind. You are attempting to apply some deep meaning to typing a character. There isn’t one, and that was really obvious when, in a matter of moments, all the pools signaled Segwit.
But keep believing that there’s some deeper meaning here and the market will continue to show that 2X is not desired per Bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:33:47
Part of me wonders if Garzik just screwed any chance of 2X being successful. While there's been a lot of talk about suing him, what's more important is that now anyone that runs a btc1 node, will be **knowingly** running a node that is hiding it's identity and intending to interrupt a computer network in November.
So I don't care much about an irrelevant programmer, I'm more interested in whether or not he just guaranteed that Coinbase, ShapeShift and others absolutely *cannot* run btc1 nodes without opening themselves to some pretty heavy liability.
So how much are you willing to risk for this?
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:12:56


So? It's clearly contentious.


It doesn't even have 80% support. F2Pool (10%) doesn't support it and Slush (6%) doesn't support it and the largest share of Other (Bitcoin-Russia) doesn't signal it. So you're 21% off the top right there.

Core doesn't implement contentious features. Consensus is required in order to implement.


They never would. That's literally advocating a chain split. The fact that you would even suggest this implies you lack the technical knowledge to understand why a "toggle button" on a hard fork with no replay protection is literally the dumbest fucking suggestion I've ever heard.


It's protecting the network from what is clearly an attack.


Segwit at max adoption is a 1.7MB block size increase. The majority of developers that work on Bitcoin are not opposed to a hard fork, they were and are opposed to taking network upgrades hostage in order to get something that is entirely unnecessary. 
We don't need 2MB now that the miners stopped spamming the network.

Pieter is generally attacked over there along with the other core devs that have any relationship with Blockstream. Wladimir is less despised because he's less politically outspoken and unlike LukeJr approaches situations with caution rather than making bold (and sometimes absurd) claims.
As for their pantheon of the list, Sirer is wrong more than he's right about the Blockchain in general, Hearn become completely irrelevant when he boldly claimed Bitcoin failed in January 2016. The price was $903 at the time. Garzik needed a number of core devs to explain how to fucking implement the block size increase, and Andresen hasn't been a developer for some time.
The most ironic, I think, is Buterin, who is adamantly opposed to a HF without replay protection.

2) Ban the attacking entity.
3) (My personal favorite) Protocol changes resulting in a DDoS attack against the 51% attacker.

I don't think you're entirely aware of what was accomplished here. Bitcoin is not an arbitrary modification of DigiCash and big gold had a ton of issues, not a "small reason" for failure... hell it didn't even *have* a reference implementation.
Satoshi managed to white paper a digital currency while simultaneously implementing both a gaming component and solving the double-spending problem. Then he managed to write a reference implementation for it. 
In academia it's unusual for only one person to write a white paper, even a 9 page white paper in a specific field. It's even more unusual for that same person to write the *reference implementation* of said white paper and it's bordering on absurd for a single person to write a white paper AND and entirely working reference implementation of said white paper on their own.
Not only that, but he wrote really *good* code. What academic does *that* (

What the hell are you talking about?
85% of miners are signaling segwit2x support. Including every company you just metioned (except nChain since they are irrelevant). Do you even understand what segwit2x is? It's segwit + a hard fork 144*90 blocks after segwit activates, which is likely going to be either July 21 or August 1.
Segwit is coming, the only question now is what happens after it. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:28:16
Effectively, the current hash rate shows about 45% signaling for segwit. We need it to be 51%. If at some time before August 1st, 51% of the hash rate signals for segwit (for some period of time), segwit activates and there won't be a chain split.
If by August 1st we still don't have 51% of the hash rate signaling for segwit, then a chain split occurs. This doesn't mean we'll have two coins permanently, but it opens that as a possibility (one of many).
This is bad because this will create a lot of volatility in an already volatile market. And the potential to have two separate coins is problematic for both market related reasons (which one IS bitcoin?) and technical reasons.
Needless to say, if the miners stick to their word and activate segwit by July 21, all of this is moot. At least until the threat of the hard fork comes into play.

All SPV wallets. That includes Breadwallet. Well it includes all of them. They are all designed to follow the longest chain. The question is, what happens if the shorter chain has the higher market value. In that case, most of the wallets will release emergency updates to start following the more valuable chain.
Bottom line, the miners lose if they are mining the least valuable chain. They may do it short term in order to "win", but the pools are *pools*. They will only do that for a short time before the miners are going to push back.

Nature of the beast when the miners break with the rest of the community. Frankly, my gut tells me miners activate segwit within a couple of days of the 21st. That way they can claim they "fixed" the problem, and BIP 148 can be happy because they get what they want.
The bottom line is, miners are terrified of BIP 148, because if it succeeds it proves the hash rate doesn't lord over its users. They don't like the idea of Bitcoin not being controllable by them. So, just like with LTC, they are going to capitulate while claiming a victory. 
At the end of the day the really interesting shit probably doesn't start unless they *actually* hard fork after segwit.

He expected server farms. He did not expect server farms in which the cost of ownership is so insane, and capital requirements so insane, that only a handful of people would be able to pull it off. 
The problem with ASICS was Moore's Law. The capital requirements for them were terrible and with every few months they became obsolete by better processes. It became more problematic by ASICBoost (which is literally gaming). 


So do you. 


Yep. And plenty of people that know more than you. Yet you are ignoring people like the Bitcoin core devs who know, individually, more than both of us combined. 


And that's where we are very different. I assume that the developers who understand the technical aspects more than any other probably should be the ones to seek advice from when we discuss technical issues.
Jihan is an economist. I trust he has less technical knowledge than any developer. Ver is an investor. He's a brilliant PR guy but has the technical understanding of my toe. Craig Wright is a con man. I'm a software engineer but even my fairly limited knowledge of cryptographer sets off alarms every time he speaks. Finally Gavin, while a competent developer, is very clearly driven by control above all else. He wants power. And anyone that is driven that much by power makes me nervous.
So you misunderstand. I *am* humble. I follow the advice of level-headed individuals that seem to want consensus and a long future for Bitcoin above *all else*. I see that in Greg. I see shortsighted financial desires out of the other side of the equation. Short-term fee decreases at the expense of long-term adoption.

The market will likely value the name far more than it will value the hashpower. I would be willing to bet that *if* the exchanges do the same thing to HardForkCoin that they did to BTU, this agreement instantly dies. 


Who cares? Miners have made a TON of cryptocurrencies but many of them are completely irrelevant. *Who* makes the chain is completely moot. *Who buys* the currency dictates everything. I can make a chain mining with my laptop by introducing a HF. But I haven't actually created *anything* because it has no value. 


I'm willing to bet that if the miners fail to follow through on the NYA, the exchanges will end up listing both BIP 148 and Legacy. And I'm willing to bet if someone breaks from the agreement, it will no longer be 80% of the mining on the legacy chain.


I disagree with your presumption. *Anyone* can make a chain if they have a computer and the software to make an incompatible chain. You lend so much to the miners but there's literally *zero* overhead to mine. You can do it with a phone. Not profitably, but that's not the point here. The point is making the chain is meaningless. It provides no value. The only real value miners provide is security on a chain. But that also doesn't matter if there's nothing of value to secure. 
Chains are meaningless without value. Miners are meaningless without value.


Longest *valid* chain is all that matters, and it's a very important distinction. 


He won't need to if the miners follow through. He won't need to if BIP 148 has more value than Legacy. He won't need to if the chains are close enough in length to both survive for a time.
There's a lot of variables and assuming a PoW change is *going* to happen is silly.


There's no rules that make miners the voters. That was a mistake that BIP 9 introduced and its own author regrets it. BIP 8 will be the future assuming this miner HF fails. In which case the miners will never again dictate or hold hostage progress.


The danger here is assuming majority hashrate = majority. If BIP 148, at any time, has more value than Legacy, miners will jump ship and that will effectively end the issue.

Well, not really. So if F2Pool gets DDoS attacked and doesn't mine for say ~500 blocks, then they don't matter because it activates over a 336 consecutive blocks (activation periods are every 336 blocks). 
So what happens is the other miners will continue to mine BIP 91 blocks until they reach the 80% threshold. The only issue with losing F2Pool is technically block times will be longer, because F2Pool accounts for a large (10-15%) of the hash power, so technically those 336 blocks will mine 10-15% slower, since the current difficulty is dependent on F2Pool mining.

That's the biggest problem. It's a contentious hard fork. It doesn't mean the requirements of consensus. The chain with only 17% mining power is certainly going to have reduced block times, but that's okay because *if* that chain is more valuable than the new chain, miners are going to move back to the legacy chain. 
was being VERY kind when he said a year. If the legacy chain has a higher market value than the Hardfork chain, the miners will come back within days or weeks, not months.

It's not 99% and its a stupid position BIP 148 wants segwit, if it gets that through 91, 148 or 149 its moot because it wins no matter what. Bitcoin with segwit will be bitcoin. That's all that matters.

Only in their crappy segwit2x implementation and even then it only activates in November. Anyone running BU or Segwit2x can simply uninstall it and run something else the moment Segwit2x activates. 
This whole thing is smoke and mirrors so the miners can save face before the August 1 deadline. The reason they rushed this so fast is because they honestly thing USAF poses enough of a threat that they wanted to enable segwit before it.
At the end of the day, the miners are finally recognizing they have no power without the economy.

Hard forks require a great deal of care and coordination between the economy, the miners and the users. You need time for clients to properly support the fork (and select the correct chain) and you, most importantly, need to not fuck it up with software bugs and/or establishing too much node centralization thereby making Bitcoin more centralized. 


SegWit will bring that via the average block size increase. We need time to let that play out before we make any assumptions about what fees are going to look like.
Rash moves are *bad* for Bitcoin. We are making a change that won't activate until mid-August and that change happens to include an increase in the block size. Let it play out through September/October and if fees are really high, start the discussion on a hard fork.


No, it's called "don't fucking hard fork a $50B economy unless you know it's absolutely necessary". We are doing a softfork that results in a block size increase. It is absolutely insane to do both when the latter may be entirely unnecessary.

Segwit is going to happen, the 2x is another issue entirely. And there's no such thing as too late for UASF. The only goal of that is to activate Segwit. If it activates before that most UASF people will consider that a win. Hell the reason the miners agreed to enable Segwit in July is because of the UASF.

No they aren't. 
This has become their religion. Anything *other than* big blocks are bad, dangerous, have deep security issues and despite segwit running on Litecoin without a hiccup, it's literally the most dangerous software to ever be written ever.
That's why this is no longer a conversation. is obsessed with and how many times Greg and Luke wipe their asses after going to the bathroom. They are obsessed with it.
I like you Erik. I disagree with you on how Bitcoin should scale, but I also think you're a *really* smart guy that I just happen to disagree with. But there's no disagreement or intellectual conversations at about anything. I've had PLENTY of disagreements here. Some of them heated.
Over there, you are either anti-segwit or your downvoted. And for all their talk of censorship here, I'm rate-limited at because I've been downvoted like hell over there, no matter what I say, because I support segwit and I don't support a HF being rushed 3 months after.

No actually, ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering, which *can* be a token based on the ETH blockchain or it can be a cryptocurrency unrelated to ETH. The security is the token/coin. ICO's can accept any currency in exchange for their token/coin. 
The underlying security is the coin that's being traded *for* ETH. And even then, it's only a security if the coin can, in turn, be traded to the company. ETH is the currency, the coin is the security.

It does if your *goal* is to confuse SPV wallets. They flip the hardfork bit then the SPV wallets will start blocking the transactions since they aren't valid. In doing so, even if the HardForkCoin chain is longer, it's not valid, so all of the SPV wallets will select the legacy chain as the only valid chain.
What I'm *more* curious about at this juncture is what SPV wallets can do if they continue this hard fork without signaling that its a hard fork. Is there an actual response to this that will prevent the obvious problems with SPV wallets thinking both chains are the same?

No, actually, it isn't. Because averages get overshadowed when the extremes are large. In this case the highs are insanely high, while the lows are relatively close to the median. 
Let's say we have 999 people that all have $50,000 in wealth and 1 person that has $250,000,000 in wealth. The median is $50,000. The average is $299,000. That's why it's absolutely retarded to take the average into account *especially* when wealth is heavily weighted in the top 10-15%.

You need to stop. You have no idea what you're talking about. nLockTime has been in Bitcoin since the beginning. Utilizing it as a replay prevention is just a convenience.


You aren't listening. nLockTime requires user action to properly split, not just exchanges. Anyone that has a wallet will need to split in order to have actual replay protection. THERE IS NO WAY exchanges are going to accept that as a form of replay protection.




That was for the BU hardfork. The same is true of any hard fork but that was implementing a long time ago.


It's quite possible. The forking client needs to implement replay and wipeout protection and we're good to go. This is why you don't implement a hard fork in 3 months.


Or ignore the fork entirely and the miners will stop mining their worthless coin.


Yes they did, but telling BTU they wouldn't list their currency without replay protection and BTU crawled back into it's little dark cave. Same will happen here without replay/wipeout protection.

You make a lot of assumptions about what an "idealistic" person is and then run with that as if it's fact. Satoshi publicly posted months after those private emails that he wasn't Dorian. That was his last public message.

Show me the public statement where any one of those companies have agreed to the 2x part of segwit2x. 


Again, show me a public statement.


It's unclear if any of them will list it at all without replay protection. The HF isn't until November and ever exchange has been focused on segwit activation at this juncture.


So? Miners aren't the economy. 


2x is DOA without exchange support and they won't get exchange support without replay protection. They don't have enough time for replay protection. This is DOA. None of the exchanges are going to list 2x without replay protection or they risk their clients BTC.


Again, all moot unless the exchanges list it in the first place. There is 0 value in a chain that doesn't get listed, and the exchanges aren't going to risk replays. It won't happen.

The most common protocol for communication over the Internet really sucks at being consistent. Part of the protocol is that when the person sends you something the conversation goes like this:
* Sender: "Hey I need to send you something."
* Receiver: "Cool, send it."
* Sender: "K done."
* Receiver: "Shit I didn't get this part, can you send that again?"
* Sender: "K done."
And the last two continue until the receiver actually receives the whole thing. This works fine for most cases because the conversation is (seemingly) fast. But in reality, every time one talks to the other there is a delay.
So what this does is a bit different:
* Sender: "Hey going to send you some shit. I'm also going to send you some extra shit JUST IN CASE you don't get all of it."
So you are sending MORE data, but you only ever have to communicate *once*. So you effectively trade size for latency: It happens faster, but at the expense of being bigger.

Now personally, I can't think of an example where prioritizing network traffic is a good thing, without using examples like robotic surgery which isn't a thing over the Internet.

We define rights as the things the government can't do, but we also define them as something that can be rescinded. Our Constitution is written such that any "newer" Amendment can, in fact, override an older one.

No, it isn't. Nothing happens until November. Unless you think Bitcoin ABC is a thing which I find funny. Bottom line: There is no hard fork in the near future. Any miner can signal segwit now and install core later. No major exchange besides Coinbase has indicated support for segwit2x. If all the exchanges list the HF as a different symbol (which they will), Coinbase will do the same. 
There is no hard fork until it's here. Up until that point it's nothing more than miner intent.

For the nodes? They aren't going to make money but they aren't going to lose money either. The barrier to entry here is a computer and bitcoin. 


That's guaranteed by the nature. It's a router. It receives bits, the address of where the bits came from and the address where to send the bits to. That's it. They'd have to rewrite custodial/counterparty laws in order to cover that.


Who cares? There's going to be a mountain of non-compliant nodes. You need a computer and bitcoin. There's zero barrier to entry.


Yeah I copy pasted from the last time I had to say this.


That's assuming a lot. Nodes that refuse to connect to anyone based on a custodial chain that doesn't exist simply won't exist very long. 


I think the government is gong to have a vastly harder time controlling bitcoin than you do. You think every coffee shop is going to have to implement KYC? You think every coffee shop is going to only go through nodes that support KYC? The amount of man-power to regulate that would be overwhelming.

To counter the point you made, because it was decidedly wrong.


You have no idea what you are talking about. If the miners pass segwit with 95% consensus by the end of July BIP 148 won't do anything. If they fail to a chain split is *possible*.


What the hell do you mean by "pass". It's going to activate. Period. And if it activates with 1% of the hash rate that's enough to get started. Once it his the 51% tipping point the game is over.
The only way BIP 148 gets stopped at this point is if: Nobody uses it (that's already not the case), nobody mines it (already not the case) or Jihan 51% attacks the network, which will prove his the corrupt piece of shit most of the community thinks he is.

That just ads more unnecessary complexity to the issue. If more than half the miners are signaling segwit it's pretty much over and everyone else confirms.

Nothing is going to increase the mining pool because the barrier to entry is insane. Higher fees per block is moot if you don't have the hash power to ever solve a block. And you will never have that without an ASIC farm.
Mining centralization isn't going anywhere. The best thing we can do is make their voice in community decisions less relevant. Users choose the coin, miners mine it.

No I don't. I support the Core roadmap. segwit opens the LN implementation. Both reduce network load. Once the network load gets too high *after* segwit and LN are implemented and widely used, increase the block size. 
The only reason you are paying high fees is because miners have been blocking segwit for a year. Had they implemented it, we'd be on our way to LN right now. You must vote Republican. This is exactly what they do, stand in the way of any possible progress and then complain that the other side is at fault for no progress.

That is not a fact. You are assuming that correlation is fact. It isn't. The fact that the first lower high happened at the same time as the announcement does not mean it caused it, nor does it mean its downward spiral that followed was a direct result.
You are literally saying correlation = causation and everything you state after is a strawman.


Causation != correlation


Probably true. But fact is irrelevant here since "ICOs are cashing out" is vague and can mean in number of things. 2 ICOs dumping their ETH can be "cashing out" or 2 ICOs selling 10% of their ETH can be "cashing out".


Okay, now I know you have zero concept of how markets work. Corrections happen all the time. The fact that a daily trend from $888 to $2446 happened so fast *is* a reason for it to break. That kind of market growth is *not* sustainable. Ever.


It isn't a fact. LTC is up some 8% over 7D. It's probably true for most altcoins that their market value is pegged to BTC, but there's a difference between "fact" and "probably true".


A god awful one if you don't even understand market corrections.

That would be insanely expensive. You have to understand they make these units for customers also. The last time this issue popped up for Litecoin the increase in hash rate came, shockingly, at the same time they delayed orders for customers.
Bottom line, if they have hash power it's either designated to customers or it's currently mining. And unlike Litecoin, Bitcoin has MASSIVELY more hashpower already in the system, so even if they did "borrow" (steal) their outgoing orders they couldn't affect the hash rate much more than they already can. 
Bottom line, what all the non-bitmain pools do dictates everything. If F2Pool and the (few) other major pools mine segwit blocks the issue is over.

Nobody builds an index fund on 10 fucking stocks. That's why any other index fund on the planet tracks top 500 or top 100, so there's actual room for growth.
Regardless, most index funds don't go full moron and just buy/sell when they enter an arbitrary value, they trade on a number of things: NASDAQ 100 Index takes trade volume into account and doesn't do financial sector, SmallCap and BigCap indexes track by levels of market capitalization. That doesn't take into account Composites (market-cap weighted).
So no, that isn't how indexes work. Arbitrarily choosing the top 10 by market cap then selling when they exit the top will literally only net you a profit if their entrance to the top 10 was at a valuation lower than when they exit.
That's fucking stupid.

Like the exchanges. Only one relevant exchange has decided to do anything and OKCoin is listing both. BTCC is irrelevant. Coinbase may have signed NYA, but they aren't going to do shit unless it's 100% safe to do so. 


BitPay is irrelevant without the exchanges. They don't release their actual volume, but I doubt their entire volume in a year is more than the top exchanges volumes in a *day*. 
You are correct that it's highly centralized, but there's one major issue with the NYA: None of the big exchanges signed off on it. No Bitfinix, Poloniex, Bithumb, etc.
If these exchanges do what they did last time (won't list the coin without replay protection) the HF is dead in the water. Without a means to trade for value, the HF will have no value. And BitPay and Coinbase are *not* going to risk their entire businesses on this. 
At this point, the HF is impossible without support from the exchanges. And until they make their positions public, there's nothing we can do about it.

No. The miners follow the market, not the other way around. Follow the longest *valid* chain. 2MB is not a valid block size, thus not a valid chain.

I get what you are trying to do. But first of all, you're almost certainly wrong. Even if we assume for a moment the number of possible characters is the ASCII character set, the probability of successfully guess 256 random characters (of 128 possible characters) is 1/P(256,128). Or about 4.5 x 10^-292.
In order to successfully do what we're talking about on mainnet, you'd need two things: A DDoS attack against the current hash power majority (not that difficult since most of it is centralized in one country) and enough mining power (and a lot of luck) to successfully solve enough blocks to force mainnet to get stuck.
I'm not saying this is very likely, I'm saying it's absurdly unlikely. But it's not impossible. And it's certainly more probable than what you just said.

Because currency isn't considered a long-term asset, so you can't go the capital gains route. I'm not sure the IRS has formal rules for Bitcoin as of now, but at best it's going to be considered a commodity (gold) at worst a currency. In either case, annual reporting is required.


Depends on what the IRS can get a judge to agree to honestly. Single transactions of $10k obligate reporting to the IRS by the transactor, but the bottom line is at ANY time if the IR requests data on anyone that transacted more than $10 over a month, and they get those records, you'll be on the list.

Yes it is, and there's a *lot* of money at stake but the hash rate is pretty insane as it is. Consensus is 95%. Anything less than that really restricts what they can do outside of a chain split, which they can do with 6%. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:06:39


No they can't. This is the fundamental problem with this idea that miners control all. Miners can only mine whatever chain they want if they have infinite capital. There is a point at which mining a chain that doesn't earn any income results in you no longer having any money.


2X is invalid as far as Bitcoin is concerned. It's not invalid in an absolute sense. 


I never said otherwise. But here and now, the chain is invalid. If it becomes valuable on its own, then it's a valuable currency but it isn't Bitcoin. That's not to say it can't become Bitcoin, but the market dictates that, not the miners.


Whatever the economy decides is Bitcoin. You can't just say, the moment this HF becomes more valuable it's suddenly Bitcoin proper. The market is *always* going to choose a single coin to be dictated as Bitcoin, and that is going to take longer than which ever is the longest chain for 30 seconds. 
My position is simple: The exchanges have to be included in the process. If they all agree to follow the longest chain than the HF is likely to become Bitcoin. If they don't, then even if the HF is the longest chain it can never maintain it without a market.
But this is all theory. Once the exchanges go public about their intent, that pretty much ends the debate. If they don't list the HF (and they've said they wouldn't before, without replay protection), then even if it is the longest chain it's valueless and will eventually die due to the power of economics.
If they do allow the chain, it will come down to what the users think is more valuable. Eventually, the one with the most value will be Bitcoin.

They just have to build it into their product price, but I doubt they will need to. The majority pay pretty damn huge fees as is (something like 1.5-3% + $0.10-$0.30), so LN fees would be an enormous discount. Even after conversion to fiat it would be much cheaper.
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:02:07


Wait what? I've literally never heard that before. Maybe it's because it makes absolutely no sense. You are literally arguing that, despite centralization of wealth in a massive way, it's the fact that poor people are eating that's the problem?


I don't even know how to respond to this. Wealth distribution has changed. The middle class once *did* accumulate wealth. They aren't any more, because the overwhelming majority of wealth accumulation is now occurring in the top % of wealth holders. 


I never vilified anybody. I'm saying that the majority of new wealth that's generated in this country is going to the minority of people that already control a significant majority of the wealth. That's just a fact.


This is getting absurd. We are talking about wealth not being well distributed. Now you are saying we should ignore *where* said wealth *is* accumulating because it doesn't matter? 
If the top 10% own 90% of the wealth one year, than 95% the next year how in the hell do you argue that it's the bottom 1% that's the issue?
This is a weird conversation.

It's actually quite simple: remove witness data from a transaction so more non-witness data can be put in its place. 
Shrinking the "size" of a single transaction so more of them fit into a block is hardly "Rude Goldberg" complexity. And here's the kicker: it's the only method that DOESN'T require a hard fork (thus has the *actual* least impact on the ecosystem). 
It can solve scaling issues down the line, because you can *still* double the block weight down the line, thus giving yourself an effective 2MB block size. Again, not hard. Still scales.

It literally is. Globalization is just a catalyst and that's what you seem to not understand. You are blaming the catalyst for the problem. The problem is, by it's very nature, distribution of wealth. The catalyst of the problem today is globalization. Tomorrow maybe it's automation.

The problem is the fucking fire. We are beyond the point of putting out the cigarette. Globalization isn't fixable. Automation isn't fixable. They are *already here*. The fire has begun, so now we need to stop worrying about the damn cigarette and focus on the giant fire.
The giant fire is that wealthy people (who, as you said are insulated from the catalyst) are increasing their wealth while no other class is.


The top 40% are *not* wealthy. For shit's sake, you only need to make $35,269 to be in the top 40%. You consider that wealthy? 
Besides income (wages) and wealth (ownership) aren't the same thing. I'm top 10% in income, and rank at the low end of the top 20% by wealth.

Wanted to follow up on this. Almost every exchange has already stated what they will do: BTC will be bitcoin core and BTU will be bitcoin unlimited as long as they have replay protection built in.
So technically the exchanges will support SegWit2X, conditionally. At best they are supporting bitcoin + an altcoin (which is which will be dictated by the market, not by the miners) or we'll have bitcoin + a bunch of miners mining worthless shit.
For the record, Coinbase will fold like a god damn piece of paper if BCU doesn't git listed on the other exchanges. No damn way they are going to accept worthless fake money for long (if ever).

Wait, what? Do you understand what that article even says? $12 trillion is the public held debt. That isn't the cost of the bailout. 


There are inflationary cryptocurrency too. If you think that we've solved the problem of inflation by implementing cryptocurrency I have a bridge I'd LOVE to sell you.


It's not going anywhere anytime soon. Cryptocurrency is in its infancy. Any feasible time period that it replaces fiat is well after you and I are dead.

That's not how proof works. The burden is on the person that made the claim. Proving a negative is damn near impossible. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:19:48


That was perfect.

Coinbase is going to do whatever nets them the most money. If this HF looks more contentious in November, if *anything* they'll let you transact for either coin. We don't really know where support is for segwit2x because right now the focus is on segwit. More importantly, if transaction fees plummet after segwit activates, the entire miner argument dies along with the hard fork.

Aww... another idiot that has no technical knowledge thinks "wins" by calling people tweens. You all have the same thing in common too: You suddenly discovered reddit within the last month!

It would take that many to outperform a GPU that costs under $1000. 
And this is all moot. A botnet can't publicly flex its muscles like Jihan can. The only problem with mining centralization is if they use their power to do something. A botnet runner is literally doing it for $ and nothing more. They aren't going to go public, they won't (even with 100,000s of CPUs) have the hash power to attack the network, so whatever.

He either runs segwit on Bitcoin or he runs ASICBoost on Shitcoin ABC. That's up to him.
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:14:30
This. is now the anti-segwit crowd (yeah... That's a thing). And since they all agree on that, the majority of their top posts are literally just pointless shit talking of the devs. It's a sad place for sad people.
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:43:15
That's not true. Coinbase is. You think accessing and reading on Alphabay was more approachable than putting in your bank account 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:33:27
Everyone is subject to context you fucking moron. The fact that you ignored context makes YOU look like a bitch and a dumb one at that. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:19:54


Show me where the exchanges state they are 100% replay protected from the coming hard fork. I'll wait.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:50:35
LOL. So you make broad claims about what's going to happen and when I ask for proof you say "ask them". This whole thing was a joke.

It isn't a contract, it's a membership fee. Your remedy is leaving, and with it, the exit tax (if you are eligible for it). 


None of those were conditional upon income taxes taking place. The contract is simple: You get representation (but not *only* yours) and they get income taxes.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:21:09


So, trust you, they are involved? LOL.


What the actual fuck are you talking about? nLockTime has *nothing* to do with Segwit or Segwit2x. Sure you can utilize nLockTime as a form of Replay protection, but that's user-implemented and no exchange is going to accept that as actual replay protection.


Yes, coin splitting for some SPV wallets were introduced when BU was threatening to split the chain, but who gives a shit? That has nothing do with the nodes.


Thomas Voegtlin, the primary developer behind Electrum, is against opposed to 2x. Feel free to show me any publicly accessible link where he is working with the 2x people to implement it in Electrum.


That's a step above posting terms when you don't even understand what they mean.

Most people don't own basements full of gold either. This is how most institutional investors do assets and as of right now, Bitcoin is largely considered an asset not a currency. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:37:25
Holy shit you don't even know what context means. Again, I understand how hard this is with brain damage, but my analogy was there to imply I can buy a crypto and not an ICO in the same way that I can buy a stock and not an IPO.
Do you need someone to translate that into asshole for you?
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:21:10
What defenses? Miners are already signing on to segwit. The economy has spoken on the issue. If "defenses" means "signaling before August 1st" then I guess you're right. But I don't see how doing what BIP-148 wants is defending anything.
@_date: 2017-07-05 04:03:36
It's uninteresting *because* it's a bitcoin clone. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:18:20


Yeah, and how *exactly* does SegWit do that? Everyone loves to talk about LN or sidechains centralizing control, but no one seems to *ever* want to talk about how SegWit centralizes control.
Oh that's because it doesn't and Craig Wright is a quack. Neat article.
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:29:47
False. If they try to force a feature without Core they will simply make worthless invalid blocks. Miners have no control without user software and almost all users choose core.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:11:46
Oh I figure it's a possibility so I still think 148 is the right call. More like I'm *really* hoping they don't do something so stupid. But given Jihan's shit so far it wouldn't shock me. He strikes me as a puppet. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:45:08
Literally what has been the entire time.
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:11:15
It's an inverse relationship with luck, but a metric fuck ton. It's extremely unlikely that so much dark hash power even exists, but that makes it absurdly unlikely, not impossible.

No it won't. The economy chooses, the miners follow.

Ver is an activist investor, and he tend to rub people the wrong way because he has that "I'm the smartest guy in the room" vibe, when he rarely is.
Jihans company runs a number of the major mining pools and it's generally known that his goal is to protect his profits at any cost, and largely takes the blame for holding back Bitcoin improvements over the last 2 years.
