I know Mark to be a very smart and generally nice person who really cares about the future of Bitcoin. I think himself and his organization will come to the correct decisions and they are probably focusing on getting the problem fixed right now and will deal with the consequences afterwards. The Foundation board is probably discussing the issue now as well, however I have no idea. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:13:50
I resigned for this exact reason. I did not want my own issues to get dragged into the foundation, an organization that I founded. At this point, I have no involvement with the Bitcoin Foundation - Charlie

Hey, my sister was just disgruntled due to a family issue, but thats been long solved and her and I just had lunch actually. Regarding that quote, the NY Times reported on it recently, I said it merely as a joke one night at my bar and a reporter standing next to me took it and wrote it down. Ask anyone who has personally met me, they can tell you what I am really like. Hope all is well! 
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:28:33

I studied Jewish History which included Zionism in college mostly because my family went through many hardships being kicked out of their home and having to be spread around the world. Modern Zionism has many issues, I agree with you on that, but I believe every nation should have a homeland and that includes Arabs, Christians and Jews alike. However, my views on that subject should not judge your views on me personally, I would hope :)

We would prefer if you did 1 transaction, we keep under $100 transactions cheaper to entice new users into Bitcoin, as a 'test' run and we dont make money on those.

Hey, have you contacted our support? 
Instead of creating a reddit, send me an email charlie or PM here. You can also call us 716-712-4846 or our Live Chat on BitInstant.com 
@_date: 2012-11-27 07:50:52
@_date: 2012-10-02 01:32:10
Sure, I will explain. 
If we just take your Account number and Sort code, it runs thru the ACH system (like Dwolla) or the European EFT. This is very prone to scammers who rip account numbers off checks, ect. Also, ACH and ETF take 3 days..just like Dwolla. 
Our setup here, utilizes our own system we had 91 banks sign up for. Basically, 24/7 as long as you prove ownership of the account by answering those questions, the bank will release the funds to us immediately. Feel free to try it. We are extremely trusted and will not share your data. 
This is an instant online bank transfer. We have accounts in all of these banks, your doing an account-&gt;account transfer. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Hey, 
Instead of posting this long reddit, why did you not send us an email or send me a PM or email? 
We DID NOT charge you 3.99%, we charged you 1.99%
Email me ASAP charlie

Yes sir, everyone is working 100%. It was a TH staff member who deleted the text on the website without realizing. No worries. 
-Charlie 
@_date: 2012-11-28 07:09:50
Ok, we will work on it, thanks
@_date: 2012-04-26 13:34:13
Don't forget, we pay hefty fee's for the banking contracts and legal compliance we need to do. So when you pay the 4%, our profit is actually less than 1% at times. As soon as fees rates lower, we lower rates. With the new locations, the fee's will actually be 1-2% cheaper. 
@_date: 2012-10-29 23:51:11

Hey, you should be good to go! We had to block some Tor nodes during our DoS. 
@_date: 2012-06-28 00:56:18
We understand this is a more 'premium' service, for those needing to cash out quickly and small amounts. We bring reliability, good customer service, and a legal and safe company that will protect your privacy. Customers who use us, stay with us because we take care of our customers. Competing services are great, but our volume will immediately raise red flags while their low volume won't. Due to this, we have to secure permission and pay a middleman with a special Paypal account. 
BTW- We had this live a few months ago before our competition did :) We had to turn it off once Paypal got wind.

Hey, have you contacted us and has this been resolved? 
I wish you'd wait to hear back from us before posting a negative reddit like this, funds are never lost, unless you sent it to someone elses address which does not seem like the case. PM me here and i can help

Hey, your Passport number is one of a few types of verification. Please understand UseMyFunds has been in business for 22 years and the only reason we ask for it is to make sure the bank account you are using is actually owned by you. We do not store or save this info. 
@_date: 2012-04-22 16:13:20
Your welcome! 
@_date: 2012-11-07 04:00:49
quickbitcoins was actually running their bank deposits thru BitInstant. 
TrustCash may no longer be safe to work with, so it is disabled indefinitely. Even competitors work together for the greater good of Bitcoin, and we've alerted our competitors to not continue working with TrustCash which they have agreed to. We have more, better, and cheaper deposit locations launching super soon to replace bank deposits. 
@_date: 2012-06-27 05:14:55
Hey, the fee is 3.99% for Walmart, 7-11, CVS, ect. Some Moneygram locations charge a $3.95 convenience fee but you dont have to pay Moneygram fee's. Banks branches don't have a convenience fee. 
Note that many of our costs are high, we protect our customers privacy and operate legally. Other services operate illegally, and are unsafe. 
Feel free to msg me for any questions/comments :) 
@_date: 2012-10-01 21:37:45
Guys, 
BitInstant has been around for more then a year. We are asking for these details to prevent scammers, fraud and allow the transfer to be instant. We do note store anything ever. 
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

BitInstant - Email and Bitcoin address payment re-enabled
@_date: 2012-11-08 16:34:39
Furthermore, BitInstant NEVER quotes you a BTC amount. We quote you a USD amount we will use to buy the coins. 
As soon as your Dwolla was transferred, our system automatically bought the coins. 
We also clearly write on the quote page "Coinapult takes a 1% fee on all orders" although most of the time it's only 0.3-0.7%
Charlie 
@_date: 2012-12-26 14:28:27
Hey, 
BitInstant is still instant, and has always been. The new locations actually are faster then the bank locations as the bank software told us in batch, and the new locations are a real time API. So, Im not sure your point on us not being instant is valid, nor your reason for not using us anymore. Most customers simply don't like the stores and liked the banks better, which I understand. However, saying that were not instant is simply not true :) 
Im sorry you liked the bank feature better, most of us did, but if you take a look at our blog post on why we had to drop the bank features you will understand. It was 100% out of our control.
Personally, the Moneygram location is closer then any other bank. 
Stay tuned on some new locations were about to launch. 
@_date: 2012-10-29 23:39:57
Ya, and make sure people get the best price when buying BTC
@_date: 2012-02-04 04:05:20

Thank you, and your pretty much on the ball here. 
The key is liquidity. For Bitcoin to succeed it needs to be super simple to get money in, out and btwn the exchanges. The latter one also helps stabilizing the volatile markets. Bitcoin won't succeed until the price its stable and when the spreads are thin. 
-Charlie 
@_date: 2012-12-26 16:48:44
We would not be here today without all your hardwork Pete! 
@_date: 2012-02-04 04:04:30
I agree, there's a healthy growing economy growing behind Bitcoin and thats what will make it succeed as well. 
You say " I think price stability measured in terms of the goods and services that can be purchased with bitcoins is what should be aimed for."
Your right in that statement, but in order for more business's to use Bitcoin they need to believe that the price won't double or drop within a few seconds. Volatility is great, and arbitragers love it, but for the long term to much is no good. 
@_date: 2012-10-30 00:22:45
OP- please update if this was resolved or not. Not that Im calling you a liar, but most of this makes no sense. Please email me charlie asap

Keep promoting and using! We are actively getting rid of the middlemen, which is 1 reason the bank deposits are down. 
More info: 
@_date: 2012-08-19 21:10:45
No, it will be an International and USA based card, you can be a citizen of any country. Fee's will not be insane at all, btwn 1%-2% for BTC--&gt; fiat on the card conversion and should be free to use the card. $10 to buy the card, but we will likely give a few thousand for free.

Hey Guys, 
Your card number and password/Login information for the Financial Institution is only stored between your Secure 128-Bit encrypted browser session. The information is passed through our servers to your Financial Institution. We do collect certain information from an audit perspective to identify the Buyer to the payment with the Seller. This will include the Buyers email address, Telephone Number, Name, Address, and Confirmation/Reference number from the Financial Institution.
Bank login details are NEVER stored or retained on the UMS system at any time, nor are they ever passed through to the merchant, or any other third party.

Sometimes you need to take 3 steps back to move 10 steps forward
@_date: 2012-10-30 00:23:44
Processed both!
The reason your orders failed is because you went over our limits and violated our ToS when you did a $2000 transfer. 
Our limits say "limits 500 for all transfers, 1000 for cash bank deposits, 2000 per per day, minimal order 20" right under the Send Funds button. 
In the future, please follow the limits and all will be good. 
Stay safe in the storm!

Hey, 
I'm sorry about the delay, myself and our developers have been working thru Saturday night getting this resolved. 
It seems the ZipZap and Moneygram system has been down and not alerting us of paid transfers. 
Cloudfare which we use for DoS protection changed their configuration which led to SSL certificates being changed. 
Were not the only ones effected here: 
Everything is fine, and were fixing it now and processing the orders by hand. 
Thanks for your patience. We will get this resolved asap so I can go to sleep!

Hey, yes you are correct. Our reserves ran out over night last night. They were topped up this morning. We are in the process of fixing the error so it's more accurate. 
Our SSL certificate is fine, we have some 'Share This' code on the bottom of the homepage that dosen't come in securely, we're working on that as well as the Document Type Definition header.

Hey, we're a little delayed on responding to emails. Are you owed money?

Hey, in FUNDING OPTIONS of your MtGox Account. Chose the ADD FUNDS tab (not the REDEEM CODES). Once your under ADD FUNDS, choose 'Redeem MtGox Code' from the dropdown and paste the code.

I understand the catalog for some countries are out of date, so thanks for the heads up, we will fix it before full launch!

The automated response states that your issue is in our support queue and being looked at by our CS team.  There is not need for us to contact you unless we need more info or have a solution.
I would love to try and help but you haven't provided me info so I can identify your order.  :(

@_date: 2013-06-07 14:18:32
bitcoincharts.com never shows the $80 price that you think you should receive on 4/11.  We have no control over Gox halting trading.  I'm quite sure that most people will confirm that it would be impossible to expect us to give you the lowest average price at multiple unnamed exchanges.  If you prefer the price at a particular exchange then you have the choice to go to them directly.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:14:45
Thanks :) I love BitSpend btw! Send me a banner so we can throw it on our site, love you guys.

For things like this with Order IDs, BTC wallet addresses, and such, it's better to keep a log through an email-based support queue rather than a phone-based one. Our CS team strives to answer your questions individually in a timely manner, although right now we're a little backed up. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 19:38:52

@_date: 2013-02-02 03:35:16
If you need it NOW, you can use our site BitInstant.com, but you will pay a higher fee then if you send a bank wire to MtGox.com. You can also use Coinbase.com which pulls the funds from your bank account, but it takes 4 days. All three are pretty reputable. I also like Bitstamp.net

I'm not sure where you've logged all of your info but I am here now trying to help.  Care to provide me with order info so I can at least try?  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:43:34
Hey there! To clarify, you'll get the rate at the time we receive your funds (so, when you actually deposit the money). Creating a quote doesn't lock in the exchange rate from when you made the quote. Hope that clears things up!

Hey, **your order processed fine**
Since it was the first time you did a Paypal transfer, Paypal needs to verify it. Only on the first time this happens. We will send you a refund for the delay.

That appears to be a quote ID and not an order ID.  Your order appears to have executed on 4/16.

Hey, we never markup prices. We buy BTC from mtgox auto when moneygram alerts us your deposit is made. Everything is automated. With what's been going on the past few weeks, were moving to different exchanges as mtgox is extremely unreliable. We are about 30% of mtgox daily trading volume, so when we move to different exchanges it'll make prices better and transfers faster. For more info, see blog.bitinstant.com. If you feel we owe you BTC, please post your order ID and I'll gladly resolve it :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:42:39

Thats a stupid rumor. BitInstant only buys BTC on demand when our customers deposit. We dont hold BTC. During the hack, the hacker purchased BTC with our USD reserves and sent it to himself. That rumor doesn't even make sense. This is our fault, Im sorry and will do everything to resolve this with a refund and process ASAP.

Hey, when you make an order, on the quote page we give an estimation of how many BTC. However, we instantly buy BTC and send it to you as soon as the deposit is made. We don't take any markup on the BTC price nor do we store any bitcoins. We simply buy auto on gox (which we learned last week is a bad idea see blog.bitinstant.com) were moving over to other exchanges this week.
I have found times where glitches caused a small markup, this is not on purpose, and if you search on reddit you'll see I always honor the price and send refund. If you feel your owed money PLEASE let me know ASAP. We make money on customers using us over and over again. If you felt you were scammed, we lose out, so I want to do everything I can to make it right. - charlie

Hey, I apologize if you personally have had an issue with BitInstant.
 "I bet they made a nice profit. Their site goes down for technical issues but they keep taking people's money and then only refund the people who contact them"

@_date: 2013-06-11 20:20:47
As you can imagine, with our new site launching today, we've been experiencing a few hiccups with functionality. We are actively working on resolving the issues that our customers are experiencing today and we apologize that things are taking a little longer than usual to respond to.
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:34:44
Please use our official support system...
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:46:39
This order was processed on 4/25 and sent to the Gox acct. # you provided.
@_date: 2013-02-06 21:02:12
Hey, it does work for contract phones!
Step 1) Select your country, mobile carrier, and product.
Step 2) Enter your email address and mobile number (do not add area code).
Step 3) Hit Submit button and send specified Bitcoin amount to the Bitcoin address to pay.
After this, you’ll receive emails confirming your purchase, and you will likely need to follow some steps with your mobile carrier to complete the process.
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:23:38
I'm showing your issue was closed so I've reopened it.  Sorry for any delays.

If you respond to things like, "can't find your order  and provide the info we need then we can help!  :)
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:10:28
Yes, we definitely intend to be more proactive about these kinds of things in the future and learn from our mistakes. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:37:32
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:23:14
Great!  Like I said before, I gave your order a manual push and you may see a resolution very soon.  Does this make sense?
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:57:51
I've run into this dupe issue with Moneygram myself.  Unfortunately we have no control over Moneygram's processes.
The order ID that you provided is not coming up in our system.  Are you sure that's an order ID?
@_date: 2013-05-15 01:04:25
Need to get funds to Gox?
We still do that.  :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:27:13
Probably because you waited 6 days to deposit it lol, so it expired. Give me the amount and your mtGox account and we will process it in. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:19:11
Your order was fulfilled on 4/19 and sent to the Gox acct. # you requested.  Sorry for any delays.
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:34:09
I can't help you without order info.

Every transaction has a process which allows us to complete it.  If you are unhappy with Moneygram then you are free to contact them and give them your feedback.  Let me know if you have any further questions that I can help you with.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-05 15:25:30
There are many people on the customer service team and Charlie is not handling customer service as much as he once did.  We have particular guidelines for how specific issues are handled and we do not pay customers to move their money from one account to another.  I'm sorry for any delays.
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:37:30
We've addressed this issue on our Facebook page and in a few Reddit posts. We're actively working on fixing the known issues. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:13:25
If you can provide your email I will verify that your issue is logged and in the queue.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:30:45
Locking in your order and fees are two separate topics.  I will address the locked in price per your request...
If we are in control of your BTC order / execution then we can lock in your price once we receive your order.  This does NOT mean you are locked in when you make a quote and have not yet paid.  Yes, some customers occasionally receive an amount which they believe is incorrect.  If they send their issue thru bitinstant.com/contact then their issue is researched and corrected.  I hope this helps.  :)
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:45:35
It difficult to chase customers around various locations on the internet so we offer a main support channel...
I'm not sure why my potential solution is unacceptable to you.  Did you want me to try and solve your issue?  I assume that was your goal.
@_date: 2013-02-08 03:13:21
There are many updates we can give, and as much as it hurts me, I've been told by everyone to not leak any more info except that we are still in the process of bringing it to market. We learned with the exposure of my past leak, that it can only do more harm then good 
@_date: 2013-02-14 23:39:54

We don't take support calls by phone.  Order ID  and other similar long strings of random numbers and letters do not translate well over the phone.  Support calls are not realistic and would not serve the customer with a solution.  However, I don't know the future plans for customer support and the improvements that management have in store.

This statement goes after Bitcoin businesses and miners. 
"An administrator or exchanger is an MSB under FinCEN's regulations, specifically, **a money transmitter**, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person. An **exchanger** is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. An **administrator** is a person engaged as a business in issuing **(putting into circulation)** a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem **(to withdraw from circulation)** such virtual currency."
Mind you, this is a federal statement and not a state one. US Gov't only requires Money Services Businesses to registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations. However, what they did here is clever. They said, not only is a Bitcoin business an MSB, it is also a MTB (Money Transmitter)
48 states require separate MTB licensing, failure to do this will result in heavy fines and jail time. Licensing can cost 10m+ USD and barely issued to new companies. Many states only license 10-15 companies in the whole state.

We've been very transparent.  We launched our new beta site yesterday and we're working on bringing all functionality up to speed while we resolve any outstanding customer issues.  Thanks for your patience.
@_date: 2013-03-05 21:19:43
Hey, we still have alot more auditing and securing but this is what we understand so far: The hacker changed our DNS and directed mail and domain thru proxies that we outline in the post. During this time when the DNS was changed (about 6 hours until we changed it back + TTL the reverted DNS) he was intercepting company emails, thus sending password resets to himself. He was able to withdraw from VirWox because that was the only one which we didn't have OTP enabled on withdrawing. Most other emails are done over PGP so that was not compromised and he did not gain access to our servers. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:56:48
Please bear with us as we work to bring back all functionality on the new and improved website.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:53:24

Hey, first off, I really sorry for this issue. 
As you know, we were hacked and Coinapult has been down since then, which is why your order has not processed.
I'm looking over your Live Chats and emails now, and I see Rachel offered to reroute your funds. We can push them to any exchange for you, or you can wait until Coinapult is fixed in a few days. Thanks! EDIT: Typo
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:02:59
Hey, most of the issues are related to Bitcoin Address and Bitcoin to email transfers. All MtGox orders are processing normally.

Hey, this processed! You entered an MtGox account thats incorrect so we emailed you a MtGox code on April 4th! Ending in D944B. 
Did that work? 
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:04:39
Do you have any order info?
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:48:34
Processed! and I sent a fee refund as well
@_date: 2013-01-29 05:00:53
Wow, super creepy lol..too bad we live in New York, not New Jersey. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:57:25
Most orders are processing great now.  We are toying with the idea of publishing actual stats of successful orders and how long they take.  The numbers would clearly show that we are not scammers and most orders in fact execute instantly.  Thanks for your inquiry.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:56:56
We have no power over what type of order you place or what account numbers you choose to send to.  This info is all supplied by the customer.
Why did you submit an order to a BTC address and supply a BTC address if you wanted to go to a Gox acct. which has a completely different acct. 
By the way...I would love to understand what happened here and help in any way I can.  :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:24:44
You can find your order and quote IDs in your browser history at the time you placed your order.  If you cannot find that then provide me with whatever info you might have so I can try to help.
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:56:52
Your order was fulfilled on 4/26 and sent to the Gox acct. # you requested.

It's difficult to help anyone when they don't give us any order info.  :(
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:55:07
Hey, 
First off, Im sorry about your issue. We don't ignore anyone on purpose, response times are slow while we scale up, and try to get to every customer we can as fast as we can. 
I have no memory of this, and I never did an AMA ever. 
If you are owed $500, I'll refund it right now. 
Please email me or post the Order ID. 
Charlie 
@_date: 2013-03-25 03:32:58
Hey! Whats your Order iD? 
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:12:35
This all depends on the type of order you are placing.
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:16:38
1.  Order fulfilled on 4/11
2.  Same
Sorry for any delays.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:20:34

@_date: 2013-05-31 20:34:02
A transaction like this could take up to a few days to confirm.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:43:41
Nah, just keep building a tab and pay when you leave. Mention to the waitress or bartender you wanna pay with BTC
@_date: 2013-06-11 14:05:08
We're happy to announce that our new website is now live and cash deposits are turned back on! Again, we apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. Things don't always run smoothly when implementing new technology with third-party providers involved, so thanks for standing by!
@_date: 2013-01-08 16:18:03
I can confirm its still in the works. In fact, I recently helped them bring a new member to their team who is a veteran in writing software for this type of project. Also, the Bitcoincard guys will be at the Bitcoin 2013 San Jose conference in May. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:07:35
Depending on your level of verification (we have 3 levels) you can do up to $10,000 per day! 
@_date: 2013-02-07 00:25:10
I can lookup your order specifically, PM me some info.

Sorry for any delays.  Please be patient as we work to get to your issues in the customer support queue.  If you haven't already logged your issues, you will want to do so at support.bitinstant.com
@_date: 2013-05-05 16:15:41
If you allow BitInstant to execute your bitcoin order then we can lock in your BTC price once we receive your payment.  So this means shortly after you make payment for your quote, we will receive your order and that is when the price locks in.  Let me know if you have any further questions!  :)
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:22:09
This order was processed.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:19:28

@_date: 2013-05-23 03:47:49
You entered an invalid destination account.  You are in the queue that will allow us to fix your order and resubmit it for completion.  Thanks for your patience as we correct this error and resubmit your order.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:52:25

Hey, just to set the record straight. We were not DOS'd today. 
Since our [hack last week]( we've been experiencing some DNS issues, especially in the Austria/Eastern European area. We've been making some changes and updates this weekend. While we don't/didn't expect any downtime, there has been a little of it. 
I still think your overall article is good, there is a definitely a long term sophisticated attack taking place on all major Bitcoin companies. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:52:53
Your order was fulfilled on 4/9 and sent to the Gox acct. # you requested.  Sorry for any delays.

Sorry for any delays.
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:23:43
We're waiting on the OK from our developers to start pushing these orders through. Your funds are safe, I promise. We'll be processing these orders as soon as we can!
@_date: 2013-06-08 14:24:55
No, it's not "normal," per se, but we do occasionally temporarily disable website functionality as we work on improving the user experience. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:38:01
I'm sorry :( how much do you owe you and what's your BTC address?
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:10:44
Thanks for the info.  Can you provide an email so I can escalate your issue?
@_date: 2013-05-06 04:22:02
Yes, and you did not place an order for "coins" as my quote says.  You made a cash deposit.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:26:36
Currently we buy coins from Mt.Gox exclusively on these types of transactions.  preev.com pulls current Gox data.  Most sites pull data from Gox.  Basing your purchase price on multiple exchanges that with do not do business with has no bearing on your purchase price thru BitInstant.  You purchased on a day when trading was halting on Gox for a short time.  We have no control over this.  However, you received the lowest price on 4/11 based on the data at bitcoincharts.com
@_date: 2013-02-12 14:54:24
I second this, FastCash4Bitcoins is currently the best, safest, and fastest way to get BTC --&gt; USD. They are owned by TangibleCryptography and their owners are members of the community and Bitcoin Foundation. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:20:33
Everything is running smooth currently and the support queues are not flooded.  I hope this helps.  :)
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:24:53
We are working on defining all of these issues more specifically for our customers and I believe these issues will be better defined when we launch our new website soon.
You could compare this to a stock purchase thru a broker.  You place an order and they do their best to execute that order at whatever the price is at that time.  If the stock is fluctuating wildly during your purchase then the stock is purchased at whatever price the broker is able to execute at.  We will lock in your execution price IF we control your BTC purchase shortly after you pay for your order in a similar way that a broker would purchase a stock for you.
If you believe your order was executed incorrectly then you are welcome to add this to our support queue at bitinstant.com/contact
I personally review all of these issues and help the customer understand their particular situation.  Refunds are issued if the customer experienced a delay in execution and it was a problem on our end and within our systems.  :)
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:22:49
This order was processed on 4/19.  The same day your order was placed.
@_date: 2013-05-22 15:42:19
Our cs reps will gladly respond to your emails and they have the ability to fix your issues.  Please continue speaking with them and your issue will be resolved.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:27:26
Hey, we don't steal anyone's funds. If you have an issue please post your order id and I'll be happy to resolve!
@_date: 2013-06-11 16:19:31
Yes! We are working on having full functionality on our new site. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:20:28
As I have mentioned, all of this info is supplied by the customer and it's not uncommon for customers to make mistakes on their orders.  Sometimes we can correct these mistakes but because bitcoin is irreversible by design we are unable to refund these types of issues.  I would like to help you but if you are not interested in my help I understand.
Have you done any research on where this address came from and who it belongs to?  I think this would be the first step in discovering what has happened here.  Also, I would consider your computer compromised and treat it as such until you understand what may have happened.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:23:22
I was able to find your order under the event ID   Your issued would best be resolved by going thru the support queue.  You can do this by logging your issue at bitinstant.com/contact

Hey there,
Where is your Order ID here?
Im really sorry for the delay in your order, however I dont see info here.
BiitInstant always honors the price at time of deposit and will always pay refunds. We have been doing this since 2011 and dont intend to stop now.
If anyone has an issue, please post your Order ID here.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:20:51
I know you probably hate me right now, but would it be too much to ask to resend? Itll be worth it. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 17:47:41
Going cash deposit, btc to btc address thru BitInstant is easy and quick!  Your Dwolla issue is a verification issue caused by Dwolla which you will need to settle with them before you can use them with our services.  Obviously btc to btc address bypasses Dwolla altogether.

We took it down for a few hours. We want to make sure that old orders get priority over new orders. Many people have claimed we are a scam and just using new money to fund the old. There is nothing true about this. We expect it to be back within a few hours. Thanks!

"To add a little extra security, Shrem had his father leave out one of the digits from the private key. That’s stored in Shrem’s head — and only his head."
You misunderstood. Out of the 30 characters, I replaced 1 character with a different character. You don't know where I removed it from or what I placed instead. On my newer rings, I'll probably leave out half the private key or something.

Hey there,
Where is your Order ID here?
Im really sorry for the delay in your order, however I dont see info here.
**BiitInstant always honors the price at time of deposit and will always pay refunds. We have been doing this since 2011 and dont intend to stop now.**
If anyone has an issue, please post your Order ID here.
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:20:13
Please log your issues at support.bitinstant.com
If you have already logged your issue then please refrain from logging duplicate issues as this will only slow down the resolution process.
@_date: 2013-02-07 00:22:37
I believe DialCoin.com used to exist, and TangibleCryptography used to run CellCoin but that closed as well. The issue is carriers charge a high premium for mobile billing, between 20-30% and most in only small increments. The price of BTC ends up being super high. If its demanded however..we will do it! 
@_date: 2013-03-16 01:58:34
No, its been up all day. Are you sure?

BitInstant cannot cancel or reverse BTC transactions.  This is not how bitcoin works.  Bitcoin transactions are irreversible.  You should either contact SR or start auditing your own computer security.  Good luck.

David, I already responded to your support email. Our system sent you a third email as well saying "The first attempt to reload this phone was not successful. We will try again within 24 hours. If we are unable to complete the reload within 24 hours, we will refund your points so you can try again" 
If you look at AT&amp;T, there are options to chose "Contract", "Pay As You Go", or "Prepaid". For Verizon, the Contract option is not there, so why would you chose "Pay As You Go" three times none the less when you weren't sure yourself, let it fail, and give us a bad review. Next time, contact us first. Especially when I wrote above "Please review and test"
Thanks

The main support channel offers an automated response which states that your issue is in our support queue and our team is working on a resolution.  There is no need to contact the customer unless we need more info or we have a solution.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:16:19
The best way to get a solution to your problem is thru our main support channel...
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:09:45
If a bank delays your cash deposit then you are not given additional fees to make up for this delay.  The resolution is your funds reaching the destination account.  This is similar to a Gox cash deposit.  However, if a broker is in charge of executing a purchase for you and that order is delayed due to technical issues on the broker's end then it would make sense that the broker resolve the problem by honoring the price at the time the order should have been executed.  I apologize for any delay in your cash deposit but we cannot be responsible for what you may or may not have done with those funds during the delay.  Thanks.

They are going after miners in this statement.

Hi all!
Please see this Reddit post for answers to some common questions about the issues our site has been having: 
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:09:54
It looks like some orders from yesterday had errors, and to fix them, we need to go back into the system and manually push them through. Once our developers were aware of these issues, they were able fix them, which is why orders are going through more smoothly today. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:07:37
I have multiple user names.
Once again you've responded without any order info.  Can you give me give me some order info that I can look up?  I can't work on your case if you are not helping me identify it.
@_date: 2013-06-25 14:42:33
This is just not true.  If you have an issue with your order it is corrected.  We've been in business for a very long time and anyone that has been around the bitcoin space for a decent amount of time knows this.

Charlie Shrem, co-founder of BitInstant here. 
We think about these issues every day, we now have over a dozen team members from around the world (Just take a second to ponder that, Satoshi created something that now gives me the ability to pay salaries and put food on our families table and feed our children. Insane, no? I &lt;3 Satoshi)
1- Having 12 people in a money transfer business comes with its scary security risks. We have to follow NY State and US Federal laws when it comes to who we allow in the office, in certain rooms, access to data, compliance, ect. We have many different levels of access and have to follow every bitcent to make sure nothing goes missing. To date, we have never had a theft (that we know about) All our team members go thru a thorough background check and we vet there families, friends, and past coworkers. We also have secret redundancies that prevent theft, some of these only I know about. 
2- We are currently processing no small amount. As our company grows we will have to compartmentalize who does what and what access they have. Right now, because we are still technically a 'start-up' everyone wears many hats. 
I hope I answered, feel free to throw more questions

VirwoX is a third party service that we use to help facilitate transactions to PayPal. Don't worry - what you're seeing is completely normal.
@_date: 2013-07-13 03:35:45
Hey, we turned off the ability to create new orders. If you have a paid transaction, it will be processed!
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:46:47
Check out bitinstant.com and I think you will find the answer.  ;)
@_date: 2013-03-06 00:07:10
Hey, this was not VirWox's fault. They have MFA enabled. We simply did not have it enabled for BTC withdrawals.
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:38:07
We had to turn the public Q&amp;A off at our support site because people were posting personal/sensitive information. You can still contact our support staff via email if you're having any issues.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:19:18
If you received this email then your issue is logged and is currently being worked on by customer support.  Thanks for your patience.

This feature is now live!
For 0.75% fee, you can buy BTC using your bank account! First transaction only takes 48 hours and every transaction after that  completes within 24 hours!

Hey, we sent you a MtGox code on APril 3rd ending in ACFDC
@_date: 2013-03-04 17:24:49
There's no failure. Our card is coming. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:51:39
Perhaps you should check the amount of posts recently.  There's not too many so your assumption of hundreds of unresolved complaints is incorrect and you can see that by taking note of the date and time of the posts.
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:38:18
Hey, 
The first one:
OrderID	756057aa-a41c-4153-9424-7690f294cef2
DestAccount	1ADcWdgaxG9gvQ1TQunA2afEMVtcAJCtmX
You put a Bitcoin Address, but selected 'VirWox' so the order processed to a VirWox account that does not exist. 
I will have it cancelled and rerouted now, please be careful what you choose next time!
@_date: 2013-02-06 21:10:24
Yes, of course! Its a direct integration
@_date: 2013-03-04 14:25:02
We will be back up today hopefully!
@_date: 2013-06-08 14:23:41
No problem, glad you figured it out. Thanks for using BitInstant!
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:53:18
Hey, we processed this at time of your deposit. However, Coinapult did not release the funds for some reason. Im looking into it now. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:21:01
Please log your issues at support.bitinstant.com
If you have already logged your issue then please refrain from logging duplicate issues as this will only slow down the resolution process.

This project is still in the works.  :)
@_date: 2013-05-05 15:20:14
Dwolla has recently changed it's verification process which can cause issues with Dwolla related transactions.  Regardless if you you were formally verified in the past, this could still cause a problem with current transactions.  If you are seeing a Dwolla IPN failure it is recommended that you contact Dwolla in order to go thru their new verification process.
@_date: 2013-04-26 15:04:41
We can no longer accept individual support requests via Reddit.  Please log your issue via our main support channel at bitinstant.com/contact
Thanks for your understanding.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:39:00
Do you have any order info?
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:30:34
Thanks for your inquiry.  The issue with Dwolla and Gox was a bank account that Mt.Gox had operated to handle transactions between Dwolla and Gox.  However, Gox had not filled out their Dwolla U.S. banking info correctly based on U.S. regulations so their account was shut down.
At BitInstant we are very careful to follow regulations to avoid these types of situations.
We do get some of our btc from Gox but we also work closely with many other exchanges.  It is worthy of noting that overall volume at Gox has dropped considerably and users seem to be spreading out to other exchanges.  As the bitcoin economy matures I think we will see other exchanges pick up the slack where Gox may of had issues.
I hope that answers your questions...  :)
@_date: 2013-06-13 16:12:35
No, we are busy working on resolving your issues rather then talking about it.

Have you logged your issue thru our main support channel at bitinstant.com/contact
That puts you in the support queue immediately!  :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:22:48
Please do!
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:58:44
I would agree we could be more clear about this sort of thing.  Our new website which is launching soon should have more detailed info on this.
However, I'm not sure why anyone would expect to be locked in at a price when they might be actually paying for the order days later.  We do not control the price of BTC and it's impossible for us to offer an asset to someone at a specific price when they have not paid for their order.
Let me know if you have any further questions.  :)
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:05:10
The point is to entice him to debate me.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:25:53

We are hiring more people.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:14:32
This Order was from Apr 9th so I think it deserves my immediate attention. 
In this order, customer entered his new MX account number in, when our system was still using the old MtGox Account number system. Instead, the OMS sent him a coupon code to redeem into his MtGox account. The code expired because it was not redeemed for 3 days. 
It's still our fault. Customer tried emailing and PM'ing me. For that, I'm sorry for not getting to it or any of my staff. 
I processed it and sent a refund as well. 
Charlie

Hey there,
Where is your Order ID here?
Im really sorry for the delay in your order, however I dont see info here.
BiitInstant always honors the price at time of deposit and will always pay refunds. We have been doing this since 2011 and dont intend to stop now.
If anyone has an issue, please post your Order ID here.
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:09:22
Have you logged your issue so we are aware of it?
Or give me your email so I can look up your transaction and verify it is in our support queue.
Also be aware that when the customer does not submit their order correctly then it will take longer to process.
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:39:58

Do you have any order info?
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:45:20
It can also be very discouraging when customers complain everywhere about their order but provide me with no order info to help them.
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:18:05
That is possible.  Have you logged your issue thru our main support channel?
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:41:50
Can you give me your ZipZap Account numbers?

It appears your order was fulfilled on 4/19...
@_date: 2013-06-11 23:58:39
The max limit depends on your level of verification.  You will be able to get more details as you continue to use the new site.  Thanks.

@_date: 2013-05-31 21:39:15
I've looked up your issue within our support system and it appears you've only provided an order ID # for 1 order which was successful.  Can you provide another order ID # for the second order that failed so we can try to help?  Thanks.

OKPay is a pretty well known company, they are based in Canada and Belize. The fees are pretty high though, just loading the card is like 5% or something. Nice customer support agents they have though :)

If you can provide me with your email address then I'll check if your issue is logged in our support system.
@_date: 2013-03-16 01:13:54
Sure, feel free to ask anyone who has had outstanding orders. About 70% of them have been processed and refunded. Our stellar reputation precedes us, and even though we lost over 12k in the hack, we did not take 1 cent from any customers. We're even honoring old BTC prices, in some cases as low as $35. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:55:21

I would not recommend getting into mining unless you really understand the Bitcoin economy and the mining playing field. Right now, you'd need a large investment to get your foot in the door and become profitable within a few months with FPGA mining. With ASIC's, its almost impossible to predict what the difficultly would be like and how the economy will progress. Another suggestions (although I've never done it) is to buy securities or shares in a mining pool, check out  for more info. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:57:45
Sure! Whats your BTC address and amount owed ?

@_date: 2013-06-12 20:19:38
It seems some orders are having issues connecting to exchanges, so a manual process would override the errors. Most of the time, we don't have to do it manually.

Hey, 
1- Not sure of the cost, its in the forum post. 
2- Our Meter was clocking around 500 Watts for a 4 module ASIC
3- Not sure, but the good thing is the system auto resets if there is a failure overnight or something, so mining continues! 
4-5 Not sure of the specifics, but the short answer is yes.

As I've mentioned, our new website launches very soon and will better explain all of the things you are questioning.  In the meantime we are answering questions that customers have thru multiple online channels and thru our main support channel at bitinstant.com/contact
I'll say this again so it is clear...
Just making a quote does not lock your price in when you are allowing us to purchase your BTC.  Your price is locked in once you pay and we receive your actual paid order.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:04:44

Id be glad to send you the refund, whats your BTC address and amount owed? 
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:57:56
Hey, the site is not up yet. One of our devs must have pushed it to production by mistake. We are pretty close, and I think we will launch with discounts instead of 1:1. So $50 could get you $53 in airtime. I've been pushing this project as airtime is currency in many countries in Africa, Middle East and Asia. Will keep updating. 
 please email me again (can't find correspondence) and I'll swiftly take care of it. Sorry for the delay

Hey, Ill send this over to support ASAP. The code that starts with 'MTGOX-USD...' is a MtGox code that we generate and you should redeem. A few things are possible. MtGox redeemed it if it expired after a certain time of not being redeemed, another customer / scammer redeemed it instead of you, or our system auto redeemed it for the same reason MtGox would.

I asked Yifu about this and he explained that for a while ASIC's will continue to be upgraded in performance and efficiency for the next few years. When I asked him about Quantum Computing, he briefly explained that we are still many years away from an affordable, economical and efficient quantum miner (Thats to say if even one could exist!) However, with technological advances every day, I wouldn't be surprised if something came out before then :)
