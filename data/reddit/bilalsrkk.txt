We found in GitHub an old abandoned open-source project called Peatio, which was the core of crypto exchange platform, and decided to give it a second birth.
In just a few months, with our own hands and help from the community from monolith abandonware we have created an awesome application stack of several key components that ensure the modern level of stability, scalability and security of an exchange platform and named that baby RubyKube.
The whole thing is open-source, which means you get what you see. We got people helping us coding it from all around the world.
