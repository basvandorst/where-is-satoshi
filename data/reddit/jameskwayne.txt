Wow you are such a loser. It is clear to everyone you are the one who is in denial.

We will probably see someone showing off a whole bucket of bitcoins soon.

I read your history man, you changed your statements a lot. This guy predicted the crash 3 days ago, that is not the same as predicting it will go back up tomorrow. Even that he only has 3% of the chance to be right 5 times. You seem to be someone who believes in weird ideas. In just this thread at least four guys are on his side, and you are the only one on your own. OP probably blocked you for a good reason. I am blocking you too.

Actually he was ahead of the news. I think you made a mistake. This thread was posted 3 days ago.

Didn't he predict the rallies too? Was it really obvious to you the crash would happen today? If it was when will the price go up/down next week? His also gave out really accurate timeline. No one has done that. The loans were real too, I have seen the offer on BTCC.

Then how did he predict the other four times? Also by luck?
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:01:27
Didn't he say the market will tank today? That seems to be what happened.

I use BTCC. They do offer loans.

OP might be talking about using quantum computers to beat encryption mathematically. That could be a nightmare for cryptocurrency. But when quantum computers are around, there might be other currency solutions to counter the challenge.

Or sold when it was up $1000+.

Think about it this way, if you went in 5 years ago, it probably went up 30 times for you already. Say if you use 8x leverage, you probably lost 40% to 50% last night, so you still have 15 times or more of your original investment. Right?
@_date: 2016-12-25 12:00:03
There you go. So you did well. From a simple math, you have outdone most other people by over 40% before last night. Even with the loss, you are still doing the same like most other people, including myself.

Don't use the leverage. It's very dangerous. If you really want to, I recommend 2X leverage.
