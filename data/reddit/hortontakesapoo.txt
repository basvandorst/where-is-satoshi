The bailout package mentioned in this quote was denominated in British pounds, not US dollars.  Honestly, the first thing I thought when I saw it was, "This guy thinks the Chancellor of the UK is the one who prints US dollars LOL".   
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:38:05
I'm just telling you the truth.  That's all I've done since the beginning here.  If you want to argue that no goverment decision can affect bitcoin in any way, that's your prerogative - but it's a stupid take.  Clearly more people disagree than agree with you in this thread.   That's not me being mean, that's me telling you how it is.  
@_date: 2018-09-18 00:28:26
It's a quote by the UK Chancellor printed on US dollars.   It screams, "I don't understand how any of this works".

@_date: 2018-09-18 13:58:47


What does any of this have to do with the chancelllor? lol. I mean there were plenty of US-based quotes from Greenspan, Bernanke et al that would've actually complimented the USD canvas.  Or, you know, you could've used british pounds.   Instead, the quote and the canvas have nothing to do with each other.   The strongest message conveyed here is, "I don't understand".

That's funny because I started the conversation with "8 months ago" and then you came back at me with "do you know how to read?" and "I hope you're not that dense".  Maybe you're the dense one.  Maybe it's you who needs to learn to read.   And count.  
And if I have to admit that the number has increased in 2018 (which I do) then you have to admit that the long term trend is downward.   I mean you can deny it if you want but then you need to explain how going from  96% to 54% is "upward" lol.   
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:16:17


lol 
I like how your conclusion is "you were wrong" based on 2018's move from 30% to 54%... while you ignore the fact that it more than halved a couple of weeks prior to the year even starting LOL
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:56:05
That's great but bitcoin's baked-in "currency" isn't money any more than World of Warcraft Gold or Monopoly Money are money.  Econ 101.  
I've said repeatedly that I can name *dozens* of them.  The fact that you can't seem to figure out what they are shows that you're either painfully obtuse or just dumb.   It's not that I can't help you, it's that I don't want to help you. 
I do have an idea for you though:   Why don't you go to and make a post there asking if bitcoin has any competitors?  I bet they can name a couple for you.  
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:37:45
You might want to check that definition lol.   That's not even close.   I know I said I didn't want to help you, but... you definitely need some help here so I'll throw you a bone 


And by that definition, bitcoin definitely isn't money.  So now we have two definitions of the word money, and they both exclude bitcoin.  To top if all off, at 7 transactions per second bitcoin isn't functional enough to even be money in the real world, even if people did agree to call it money.    It's pretty clear: bitcoin is *not* money. 


Go over to and ask them if they can name any of bitcoin's competitors.   I double dare you.   
Send me a link - I'll name a bunch of them there, I promise.  :D 
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:59:37

How is that any different from


My conclusion, as far as this thread is concerned, is that: 


is a bullshit conclusion.   
You can't say "you were wrong" based on 7 &amp; 1/2 months of data when the rest of the data clearly contradcits your assertion that dominance is risng.  Long term, the trend has clearly been downward, not upward as you claim (and use as the premise for the rest of your post). 
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:57:34
Dude, learn to read a chart before you go accusing people of not being able to read a chart.   It was 64.17% on December 7, 2017.    


It was above 90% for most of its life, just over 50% now... Yeah bitcoin's dominance is clearly doing nothing but rising lmao.   You're delusional bud.

@_date: 2018-08-16 06:32:08
Lol well in that case bitcoin itself isn't a competitor because it isn't money.   It's a protocol to move money - and as I said before, there are plenty of other cryotos with adequate security to compete with bitcoin when it comes to doing that.   
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:15:58
You can keep doubling down on that stupid shit all you want - you're still wrong.   Those things may have functioned as currencies at some point, but currency and money aren't the same thing.   Bitcoin is a shitty currency, not money.
It is a minor detail.   You must be joking if you think bitcoin has worked flawlessly lol.  $50 transaction fees, several-day-long confirmation times and almost zero liquidity even now.   If that's what you call flawless I can think of several cryptos that are even flawlesser lol.   
That's great that it still has more marketshare than all the others, but it started with 100%.  
You're obviously just going to keep doubling down on your stupid argument, so I'm done with you.   
Bitcoin isn't money, it's a shitty currency with lots of very real competition.   Period, the end.   Bye now - and I mean it! :) 
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:55:50
I don't have any favorites.   Nobody has to match bitcoin's security to compete with it.   Glad you finally acknowledged that fact.   
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:42:10
Based on those examples I think it's pretty safe to say you're financially illiterate.  You have no idea what money is.  You just described barter and pure exchange economies, where money isn't necessary lol.   Cigarettes in jail are NOT money.   Neither are gift cards, and neither are strip club tickets or whatever the hell you're talking about lol.   None of them are money.  
Anyway, you've admitted that bitcoin has competition more than once now, so I think we're done here.   None of bitcoin's competitors can match it's security, I'll grant you that minor detail.   If bitcoin's security set it apart from the competition so much, it would have 100% of the market share.   It doesn't.   Like I've been saying all along, security may be the only thing that matters to you, but it's obviously not the only thing that matters to investors, or to the viability of a cryptocurrency.    There are several other cryptos with adequate security to compete with bitcoin.   
You say that without bitcoin's level of security, no alt coin can compete - but look around you lol.    Alt coins have eaten up half the marketshare.   They ARE competing.   It's a fact.  
You're playing the obtuse game.  "Nothing can match bitcoin's security!" is all fine and good but it doesn't change the fact that bitcoin does indeed have competition when it comes to people buying and using it.   
Glad we got to the bottom of this!  Thanks for playing. :)   Bye now!  
  
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:06:45
It's ridiculous that you need to ask for an example lol.   If you honestly think bitcoin doesn't have competition right now you're not paying attention.

Nobody said hash rate and node count don't matter - but you seem to think they're the only things that matter.   Again, they aren't. 
If you honestly can't think of two competitors to bitcoin, you really are clueless. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:38:00
Nevermind the fact that actually acquiring the bitcoin probably cost a premium and fees too.   Oh yeah and that pesky falling price thing. You bought $1000 worth of crypto to buy silver with but ended up with $800 to spend lol
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:37:27
Why are you so worried about hashrate and node count?   Bitcoin's security is great but it comes at a great cost.  Other cryptos don't need to compete in that way - many are more than adequately secure, and compete with bitcoin at usage and adoption, market cap, efficiency, trading volume and other things.  And by the way, I can list dozens of them.    
I hope you're not one of those people who think hashrate and node count are the only things that matter - because they aren't.  
@_date: 2018-10-04 05:31:31

You're just sudddenly going to start paying suppliers, employees, insurers, taxes etc with bitcoin,  and you're just going to stop accepting fiat and only accept bitcoin/crypto from your customers...

The $ value of transactions should remain the same if the only thing that changed is the BTC price.  If you use bitcoin to buy bread, the $ value being transacted is the price of that bread in USD -- it doesn't matter if the BTC price is $5 or $50k -- the value of the transaction shouldn't change.   
For example, let's say that the price of a loaf of bread throughout all of 2018 was $3.  
On Jan. 1 2018, the price of bitcoin was about $20k.     On November 1, it was about $6k.   
Regardless if I bought a loaf of bread on Jan 1 or November 1 using bitcoin, the $ value transacted in either case was $3 (the price of the bread) - bitcoin's price has no effect on this metric.
