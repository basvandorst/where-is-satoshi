Your wallet is your responsibility. If it's lost the coins are gone. If coins are lost then the market just had to adjust for the new scarcity. The estimated number of lost coins is like 4 million.
That all said, if anyone has oh shit money in a wallet then make sure someone you trust has the ability to recover your coins.

Rising for now. I wanted a Bitcoin fire sale for Christmas ��

Note that there are different types.

This is what I'm fully expecting to happen. Pump it up, buy futures for the dip, pull the funds, buy futures for their next pump. But I'm also a financial markets idiot so, you know.

Quite a bit of work to rob an insignificant amount. Even with all that, it doesn't account for security cameras and you could bump the amount the stolen and the amount/time deposited on the blockchain.

I've been waiting for god damn winter since 7500. I need a god damn Bitcoin fire sale.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:47:36
This is awesome, thank you.

Because r/btc is a conspiracy subreddit.

Depends on the amount and what you plan to do with them. Honestly, if it's under like 500 I wouldn't be worried. Just remember that it's not truly your money till it's in a wallet that's under your control.

Probably one of the most anonymous ways of acquiring it as well.

I think you're going to see real aggressive pump and dumps but with overall upward trend.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:26:02
Holy fuck, I wasn't expecting that amount when I opened it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:57:53
Depends on the amount and what you're comfortable with losing. Personally, for a few hundred I would just use a paper wallet.

Based on what?

Gdax/Coinbase are getting slammed right now.
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:45:35
We'll see how it goes. I'm usually pretty happy with the way they go about things. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 01:19:43
Absolutely and thank you for pointing it out!

It's a currency with high volatility right now. People are using it as currency but it doesn't account for the majority. Once it finds it's value, people will start using it more. Or it's possible the value will become too high and it'll be purely a storage of value and another altcoin will be the actual day to day currency.

The very short answer is no, it's not profitable. You could buy an ASIC to mine bitcoin but most people that mine cryptocurrencies do so with another cryptocoin and the pool they mine with will cash out in Bitcoin if the miner chooses that option. Somebody more knowledgeable can correct me though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:23:14
Except for the fact that what you're recommending is skirting day trading which is an entire job and most people are god awful at it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:20:25
That happened to me in 2013. While I waited a week to be verified on the exchanges, Bitcoin jumped up several hundred and that percentage jump then was a lot more.

What's up grandkids.
