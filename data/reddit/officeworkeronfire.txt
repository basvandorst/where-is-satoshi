Because when you complain to an outlet where people begin to question(as I have) Coinbase and their practices they somehow can magically get their shit together. Weird O_o

You can check on the blockchain it would be incredibly irresponsible to release info like that publically

If you look at the hashrate graph it's always been like this. Powering miners is expensive and breaks are taken for the equipments sake and to help curb costs. It's mining 101

I doubt any altcoins were affected based on their responses and thefts like this before(that I've been involved with or read about at least)

this always sucks to see happen I hope for the very best for all the holdings on the site and that the impact was as minimal as possible. Good luck moving forward bitfinex

Since google wallet changed months back that's the only way I know of to buy through their wallet. You use to be able to buy whatever with it and google had to go and fucking ruin it : /

I've explained it like CP is like the Icing and BTC is like the cake. Each are nice but both together means lots of asset(and other crypto) purchasing power!

That's never managed to stop change

lets also take this moment to chuckle that people questioned whether or not the price would rise around the halvening.

I remember seeing redditors saying the site wasn't letting them even withdraw... :&lt; rip the last few years
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:09:15


Yep. It's just the ol internet hug of death. Nothing to see here. [Move along](

I think anyone naming altcoins right now is missing out on where the real action is at. Some of us have been waiting a *long* fucking time for this shit.

too bad youtube is a giant dumpster fire...

And as a huge fan of the series I would highly recommend watching DB and DBZ 
That particular meme is early on in the series and as far as badass magical kung-fu wizard craziness goes this show is tops. /endplug

this is awesome. I was just speaking with a friend last night on how crypto is taking over the way we think about finance and this is the proof. Good work.

Thing is if you live in china and you don't know how to get around big brother you probably don't even know what a bitcoin even is. I think China is here to stay at least in some capacity. 
A better story: China bans noobs from using internet monies.

I know I saw discussion on reddit about this in this sub so you might try using the search to see if you can find more info. Also the mods might be able to help you track down the old posts about this.

tested this out and it is broken as fuck. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 14:31:12
you can buy coins directly with purse?
