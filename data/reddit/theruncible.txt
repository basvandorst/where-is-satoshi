A derivative you say? From Goldman Sachs? How could anyone be skeptical? Please take my money.

It’s a good question. 
Gold is valuable in part because it’s physically impossible to create your own gold. 
Bitcoin is valuable in part because it’s mathematically impossible to create your own Bitcoin. 
If you want Bitcoin you have to mine it or buy it like everyone else. The tokens created are uniquely suited for exchange since they can’t be counterfeited or inflated through overproduction. 
If it makes you feel any better, in my analysis *nothing* has intrinsic value that qualifies it as the basis for a medium of exchange. Not gold or salt or feathers or interesting rocks. The value is always partly subjective even if the object has important uses.
What matters with a currency is reliability and consensus, and Bitcoin is the best implementation of this system that anyone has ever come up with. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 00:21:21
Yeah maybe it’s just a temperament thing. There are plenty of old people in crypto. Fuller *would* definitely have liked Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:46:59
It has nothing to do with his politics or intelligence (there are people are smart as Noam Chomsky but no one smarter). It’s really just his age. He can’t conceive of why Bitcoin could be important or why it could have value.
Same thing with Warren Buffett, the world’s smartest investor. He’s missing out on Bitcoin for the same reason he didn’t buy Amazon and Facebook. Something he doesn’t understand can’t possibly be worth anything. 
It’s strange really. It’s as if people of a certain age can understand the changes coming and see them happening, but they can never make the connection completely.

It’s good. I know it sounds lame, but I couldn’t believe how much I liked the show once I gave it a chance. 
He interviews people with opposing politics but he has actual conversations with them, not just setups for them to be owned. And when the panel starts arguing he uses humor to keep it from becoming a shouting match.
It a big breath of fresh air, especially compared to something on say, MSNBC, where even if you agree it feels like you’re being preached to.

I never understand these articles. What’s the  problem with them using electricity as long as they’re paying for it? If they wanted the electricity for free, I could understand people objecting, but that argument doesn’t make sense otherwise.
Also, when a mining operation is set up in an old factory, why don’t they ever say how much electricity the original factory used? They might have had that info in this article but I didn’t see it.
Wouldn’t it make sense to compare the two? An aluminum plant might have used even more electricity than a mining operation. In fact it probably did, and no one ever complained about it. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:14:20
That’s a good question. 
Inflation can be caused by a government printing more money to compensate when the value of the currency drops. This can’t happen at all with Bitcoin because the money is produced at a fixed rate and has a fixed final amount. 
The value of Bitcoin can drop if the demand for it drops, but it can’t be devalued because too much of it is produced. 
As far as whales dumping Bitcoin, that can definitely cause the value to drop, but the scarcity of it means the value is likely to go up again as long as there is demand.

I believe Satoshi is really a group of people that includes Nick Szabo, Hal Finney (when he was alive) and a few others in the cypherpunk scene. I think they will go public once Bitcoin reaches a certain value or level of acceptance, though it seems like the right time would have come by now. Maybe in January?
Regardless of who Satoshi is, we know they can be trusted because they have literally never spent any of their funds. That’s even more remarkable as there would be nothing wrong with them doing so. Bitcoin isn’t a pyramid scheme any more than a publicly traded company where the founder owns a majority of the stock is a pyramid scheme.

I just mean: do you believe in Bitcoin or not? If you think it will be more important in 5 years than it is now, then stay with it. 
If you don’t, then walk away. Doesn’t matter what the price is.

0 transaction fees. The ATM charged me 0.01 mBTC. 
Not bad. But they overcharged me for the BTC cause it was still valued at $7600, so that’s their scam.

You know most ATMs are not run by the Federal Reserve, right?

It’s in the Shirokiya Japan Village Walk. The middle section where the ATMs are. 
I don’t think the regular food court has one.

I was working tech support for a nationwide ISP when 56k modems started appearing in PCs. 56k was the upper limit of how much info you could send over a 9600 baud phone line and for some reason you could only connect at 53k in practice. 
We were all “Well, this is as fast as the Internet will ever be...”

BTC is currently using about 50 TWh of electricity a year.
In 2018 China alone generated about 6500 TWh of electricity.

Old people don’t understand the Internet.
That’s my model for explaining Bitcoin FUD. 
When everyone started using the Internet, old people said it was a fad. When companies like Amazon and eBay went public, old people said they’d all fail. 
Now there’s a new kind of currency created specifically for electronic use. An Internet of money. Surprise surprise, old people think it worthless. 
Business figures like Marc Andreessen recognize the profound potential of Bitcoin while old-school 
figures like Buffet proclaim it’s worthless. 
Buffet understands money. He understands investment. He understands value. What he doesn’t understand is the Internet, which changes the nature of all these things. 
So just remember: OPDUTI. When everyone starts saying that I want the credit.

Oh yeah! You can get ice cream in the crepe so it’s like a soft ice cream cone, which doesn’t sound great, but once you try it you’re never gonna wan to go back to regular ice cream cones.

I used one just for fun. The BTC was overpriced but it was easy and more anonymous than opening an exchange account.  And, in a week or two, the BTC might be worth more than I paid for it. 
ATMs are a glimpse of a future where everyone uses crypto. I would say that is their real importance.

While we’re on the subject - what happened to Mt. Dew Pitch Black? It won the Dewcision ‘16, narrowly beating out the disgusting Baha Blast, and it was supposed to start being in stock again.

Like 6 months ago this place was full of sock puppet accounts with well-written-but-not-really posts on how BCash was the real BitCoin.
They were all trying to mic drop but not pulling it off. It was weird. What happened back then? Did the mods just kick them all off?

They’re already working on a way to only charge you $34 for a $0.10 overdraft instead of $35.

You don’t want your transactions blocked  because you’re breaking the law? You don’t want *any* transaction blocked - that’s why it’s called a transaction.
Do you ever swipe your card at the checkout and say “I hope this doesn’t go through”?

BitCoin you say? Ha!
You can walk into any bank in this great nation, place a hundred dollar note on the counter say: “Good day, sir. I should like to exchange this for its equivalence in Gold Bullion and make it prompt!”
If they try give you worthless sliver inform them that they have obviously never heard of the Coinage Act of ‘73.

BitCoin will fail. By 2019 it will require all of the energy produced by the fusion in all of the observable universe’s stars just to send a single satoshi. And that’s before you factor in the network fees.

How is anyone still selling the power consumption angle? Millions of people use BTC and the consumption is like 000.40% and I’m rounding up.
It’s the same argument they used against the Internet in the 90s. And today it uses about 2.0% of the power generated. And I’m rounding up.
