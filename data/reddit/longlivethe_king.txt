Now you can buy legal drugs with bitcoins.

I think betting would be cool. 
Two people play Street Fighter or something and you bet on who you think will win. I don't know how that would work but it sounds fun.
Edit: Then watch it live on twitch.

5k. Not 50k.

That made me laugh.

Thanks, I have some money to spend and I want to buy BTC. I'm hoping the price will go down a bit. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:12:22
I'm excited as well. I have a small amount right now 0.45 BTC, but I'm hoping to get more soon.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:13:41
Yep, I've had no issues buying BTC with mine.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:57:47
That happens when BTC are being wobbly. 
I've heard you can try to have them push it through anyway, but I'm not sure how effective that is.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:35:59
That actually happened a few days ago, I'm sure he is trying to cash out though.

This gif makes me sad.

I legitimately thought this was for a moment, interesting ...
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:16:45
People using BTC to buy *legal* drugs, that'd be new.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:32:25
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:13:11
Can you actually do this?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:49:29
Its just the right time to jump on the Litecoin train friend.
Thats what I'm doing, mostly because I can't have BTC without spending them but also because its cheap now and I ~~theorize~~ hope they will go the same way as BTC.

Its because he doesn't align with a particular party. He is on the fringes of both parties, he agrees with both on some issues but harshly criticizes them on others. He supports the second amendment but wants to end the drug war, as an example.
In this country you need the backing of either the Democratic or Republican party in order to get anywhere close to the White House. Because of his political ideologies he can't fully commit to either side in order to get their backing.

I imagine he'll offer some or all of it up when hitmen come to his door, assuming that they make it there before the Feds do.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:56:58
I don't know of any service that will do it directly. But I know that you can set up automatic buying with Coinbase. So you could have it buy a certain dollar amount of bitcoin after each payday for you.

Switch over to Android, besides the fact that they are much more forward thinking and innovative and that they are OK with BTC apps, it is also IME a much better platform from almost all perspectives. 
It just *feels* better.
Also, I wouldn't be surprised if Android accepts BTC payment before Apple does. 
Edit: Before I get a fanboy on my ass, I just want to say that this is my opinion and I in no way judge Apple users for their decision to buy Apple products. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:37:38
Haha same here.
Although, I'm using BTC as an experimental savings account right now so I'm not too worried about the small drop.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:29:20
Because he ran an illegal marketplace that allowed for the buying and selling of many, many drugs and other illegal things.
Also, I'm sure the Feds would love to get his BTC. They could say "We have taken 176 million USD in BTC from illegal online marketplaces, BTC obviously supports and is used for illegal anonymous transactions."
The Czech police and the FBI have been alerted to the events that have recently taken place, I can't imagine that they would be ignoring it.

Go streaking at the next presidential inauguration with the QR code painted on your bare ass.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:54:47
That string of numbers and letters is your wallet. 
You can send BTC from there and you can receive them there. But first you need BTC for the wallet to do anything.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:24:32
It hasn't happened with anything else, why would they start now?
