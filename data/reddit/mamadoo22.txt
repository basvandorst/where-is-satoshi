1. Send from your wallet (eg Exodus) to your exchange 
2. Convert to CAD once at exchange
3. withdraw from exchange to bank account
4. Withdraw cash from bank account

thats fairly low, isnt it?

Why do you need to invest together? I feel like that would cause unnecessary problems. Everyone should just use whatever capital they have and buy whatever amount of BTC for their own wallets.

 A millionaire off of 300USD? :/. 
Even if you bought 10 BTC right now for 5k each (50k total) and they all become 50k EACH in 5 years, thats still only half way to 1 million. But hey, maybe you just have some really high hopes for pricing lol
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:56:55
 Have 1.3k to buy, I put $650 at about $5500USD and will see what happens regarding the dip to put my other $650.

I believe you can only get them back if you know your 12 or 24 word seed, otherwise you are out of luck. Thats why people stress about writing them down, more than once if needed.

But 10 years ago that wouldnt have meant anything
