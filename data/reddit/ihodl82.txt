Nowadays everybody's Matos.
 At least when it comes to the technology program I was trying to use on the fly to replace existing face  (  Specifically singular)  of the gummy character who seems to be getting played by the ruthless master brains behind the investment machine.  Everybody's Matos  Because the program I was using would not have the option to specifically remove a single person's face without removing the others as well and replacing them with same focus inputed image.  When I came to this bump in the road I looked for other alternatives but seemingly seemed to be a bit on the pricey side for this spur-of-the-moment need for a chuckle. 
  A person replied to the comment on my reddit page (That I mentioned down below )  saying that it would be funny if the video would have Mr. matos' face in there using his funny catch phrases. I randomly used them myself on the reddit site there to joke around with different people and enjoy a laugh. I definitely understand it is not a good situation that those people are dealing with when it comes to that company and their activities, but when you're at home watching America's funniest home videos or YouTube videos of bloopers and fails and you see that 1 hopeless person trying to jump on the trampoline.   They seem to be doing fine for the 1st 4 jumps and then you start to see the tide change. Their candlestick charts starts to prove true a very bearish Elliot Wave analysis and before they had time to create a sell stop, they fly off the edge and through the railing to be left tied up in a pretzel. You can't help but laugh even though at the same moment you are feeling the pain that they felt from hitting the rail before they went through the hole. ����
  I have no experience whatsoever  In the film industry except for what experience I got from using my phone which in some cases could be more advanced than the old rotary, but when it comes to professional experience I have none and took on this endeavor on a whim 2 days ago just for the fun of doing it. I agree my humor may be very simplistic and annoying to others but I do get a laugh off of the what may seem to be burnt out, over used, one-liners of the recently failed spokesman.
 I have no intentions of making money off of this video or something or being a star it was specifically on a whim something I wanted to try to do.  In the same token in adding to this video I had no specific ideologies or Messages I was going to bring across other than to bring specific humor concerning the recently failed company and representative.
     I consider myself an artistic person in various way.  I would assume other artists may agree that inspiration isnt always at your fingertips all the time.  When I feel inspired to do something and muscle up the gumption to do it I go for it, as anybody should. 
 If you happen to watch this video and of course I dentify right away all of the errors that I make of course it's my 1st time But definitely wanted to give it a shot and possibly enjoy a good laugh with someone else that might catch that same humor as me... weeellllll... also specifically cause the redditor  mentioned it and it seemed like a fun thing to do.
 The original video is an, "In your face, dream crushing masterpiece." 
The video was made by a fellow named Bizonacci.
Original URL is: 
He has donation links on his YouTube page if anybody appreciated his original work and wanted to donate. Definitely seems like the caliber producer that you would want to pay for and appreciate his quality work.
 Me I consider myself a jack-of-all-trades and a master of some. I can work with a lot of different things, even on the fly so I wanted to engage this small project.
 I hope that anybody that watches it that can connect with this type of humor would crack a smile and maybe even leave a good comment.

Hey hey heeeeeeeeeey
What's up what's up what's up what's up what's up what's up what's up what's up 
what's UP, BITCONNEEEEEEEEEEEECT
Hey hey hey everybody, 
My name is Carlos Matos and I am coming from New York City, New York
Let me tell you guys that I am SO EXCITED, I am SO HAPPY
I am really so thrilled to be right now, 
Sharing this amazing, glorious, SUPER and EXCITING moment of my life with all of you guys
-and let me tell you that we are really changing the WORLD as we know it
The WORLD is not anymore the way it used to be
mmh mmh NO NO NOH.
We are coming and we are coming in waves
We are starting and to actually go all over the world
We all built in the entire world
Let me tell you guys that I started 137 days ago, with only 25 thousand six hundred and ten dollars
-and right now I am reaching one hundred and forty THOUSAND dollars
WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH
WHAT'S UP
And let me tell you that I am actually earning around one hun- 
I mean around one thousand four hundred dollars on an everyday basis seven days a week
I am right now independently, financially independently, I am saying to so many people who say that this is going to be a con artist game, that this was gonna be a scammer game: “Hey, you are gonna lose all your mone-” 
My WIFE still doesn’t believe in me! I’m telling her “Well honey this is real”
“No no no no no no, that’s a scam!”
And I say “But wait I’m gonna go to the banks, I’m gonna get my bitcoins, I’m gonna actually put it into dollars, here they are right on the table!”
“Aww, that’s money that you took from one of the accounts!”
I say: “What am I gonna do?”
Then I said to myself, “You know what? When I started to put ten thousand dollars a day on her, right on her, y’know on her table” 
Then she’s gonna say: “WOOOOW.”
“YEAYEYEYEYEYE OK, THAT’S REAL”
So guys, I wanna tell you something:
Faith and belief is the one thing we will need to be able to change the world. And right now, I believe, that in this room, we have the seed, that’s gonna germinate, and that is going to EXPLODE, into an AMMMAZING opportunity for us to change this entire world.
I am so proud, I am so honored, I am so EXCITED to be here right now-
And hey let me tell you something, that each and every one of YOU, has the opportunity to become, like those amazing people that we know here FROM VIET NAM! 
HEY HEY, MY PRPL(indistinguishable)-VIET NAM, making so much money that they can probably have a real hard time counting it! 
So GUYS, let me tell you:
I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE
BIT CON EEEEEEECT

I'm sure we've all learned that lesson as well I definitely skimmed some off the top myself before it dropped so I wasn't completely down.  Hopefully with what you are doing you will definitely get it back even more so..blessings!
