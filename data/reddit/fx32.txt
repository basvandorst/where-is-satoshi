Now, if only you could pay your taxes in bitcoins...

Being able to use bitcoin at all places where you can use google wallet... that would be nice though.

Completely different businesses though. People would be more likely to buy a book with bitcoins than a $10.000 Dell server. The majority of consumers don't get their whole income in bitcoin anyway, so most of them wouldn't get enough to buy more expensive products with it.
You can buy cars and order food with bitcoin in my country, both from big corporate chains... guess which one happens most.

The most secure way is to store them, in order of importance:
* Put the coins in the wallet on your own computer, not on a website. If your own computer is safe (a private, malware free computer) and you're storing a small amount, this is generally safe enough.
* Backup your wallet to a few USB keys, to secure it from computer crashes. 
* Optionally encrypt the wallets. If you lose a backup drive, and the finder knows how bitcoins work, they could spend your coins and invalidate your own copies.
* If you don't need to spend the coins for a while, delete the wallet from your PC, to protect it from bitcoin-stealing malware. This is usually referred to as "cold storage", as you are effectively locking your coins away, even you can't access them without restoring the backup. Be sure to test your backup drives!
* Store the USB drives in a combination of places like your kitchen drawer, your physical wallet, a fire-safe vault, or maybe even a deposit box at the bank, depending on the amount of bitcoins. Treat your backup storage devices as if they were cash currency, you wouldn't keep a $100k worth of savings under your pillow, but buying a new fire-safe vault for $100 worth of bitcoins might be overkill.
Whatever your method is, be sure to test it all out with a small amount first, if you lose all backups your bitcoins are gone forever.

[Citogenesis]( ;)
Although it actually happened before the existence of the internet as well. 
The cycle was just a lot slower and a bit more well-documented, so errors were easier to trace and eradicate.
The question for me is never "does your article/paper include sources", it's "where do the sources lead to, what is the *root* source?" Sadly, it's often difficult to find perfectly trustworthy root sources, even for the most thorough journalists/scientists.

I'm actually glad they rectified their initial article (copying BBC) with an article saying "or maybe not" (citing various source, among which this thread).
At that point, anyone interested in bitcoin will probably start to do some research into sources and credibility of the news on their own. I rarely visit this sub, but have a few coins which I mined years ago, so I was moderately interested in the news. 
News agencies either have to be sure, or just report on all available sources and let their readers decide what to make of it.

To go meta, the Dutch public broadcasting organisation (NOS) is [actually referring]( to this thread as a source for doubting Wright's claim.
