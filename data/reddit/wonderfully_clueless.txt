@_date: 2014-07-01 20:57:08
Don't worry. I have a warehouse full of others just like it.
@_date: 2014-10-01 02:03:52
Have also tried. Didn't work.

Was it one of those OneVanilla Prepaid Visa cards?

"Some customers have reported successful linking, so we always suggest giving it a try, but there is no guarantee that it will link properly."
That's from an email from their support team. I'm thinking that it has to do with the "FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR 24 HOURS AFTER PURCHASE" on the back of the prepaid's packaging.

@_date: 2014-06-13 17:12:28
Damn. I was afraid of this. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:52:05
It's on coinmap now!
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:52:42
What? I never got any btc from them. In fact I haven't been able to buy from them yet. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:56:12
hahah, i wish.
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:46:16
This is the exact problem I was having. I just emailed support. I guess we'll see...
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:12:22
Figured. But it's all my poor ass could afford.
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:34:32
What are those cards?
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:43:48
Has not yet. Circle support just reached out to me and said that the are looking for the problem and the solution. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 00:20:33
Considering I an buy one for 480 new and not put through hell, I'll pass :D
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:06:40
Awesome! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:15:31
In addition to the cards, their website also features a wallet which you can use to send BTC to other addresses. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:09:49
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:26:22
Haha I know the owner's son and he asked me to put it up like that :P
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:57:29
Can't go wrong with the big O.
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:51:08
IDK if he ever showed you this, but I made a paper wallet based off the website. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:37:34
Not really planning on mining. I plan to use it for its intended purpose.
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:09:04
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:47:03
no one ever does. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:29:40
I actually ended up getting an answer after I tweeted at them. Apparently you CANNOT use prepaid cards to buy from circle. That was then though. Idk what the current situation is. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:36:38
i sure hope youre correct in saying that, that would be amazing for the development of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:15:13
yep, i have the coinbase app!
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:26:18
These look awesome! I'd love to get my hands on a few
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:47:25
Good on him. It's gonna be interesting to see how this turns out.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:32:12
I think the thing we're missing here is the fact that OP's account is 0 days old. Just a troll, move on.
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:31:41
cool! this is what i have right now!
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:49:55
This is a good point. Perhaps very soon we'll see the impact?
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:52:54
haha it happens to the best of us, right?! :P

Is this guy legit? I've been away for a couple days.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:31:28
about time to buy
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:32:31
yeah, its pretty much the entire coinbase website but in an app
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:03:21

@_date: 2013-11-15 18:43:22
well shit. my bad. haha what would i have to do to be an early adopter?
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:53:13
Note: all credit goes to bitcoinpaperwallet.com for the layout!
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:26:50
according to the app, I can!
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:30:57
could i perhaps use the coinbase app? i already have an account with them and i believe it gives me the option to scan a QR code.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:51:50
On the homepage of Coinbase you can see a "Send Money" button up towards the top right side of the page. Click on this button and its gonna ask you to input a receiving address. Find your Multibit address by clicking the "Request" tab. You should see "Your Address" followed by a whole bunch of random letters and numbers. Copy and paste that address into the before mentioned "Receiving Address" text box. Input how much BTC you want to send and then click send! You should see your Bitcoins in your Multibit wallet shortly!
Hope this helped! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:34:01
hahah yeah
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:38:38
Fuck that. Rub it in her face. (But you could probably ask to remain anonymous if you really wanted.)
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:05:24
while, i don't agree with your comment, i appreciate you taking the time to comment on my post!
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:48:00
no, he's saying that only gay liberals (what fox news directly opposes) read. Therefore foxnews does not read.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:57:44
Yes! This is what we need more of! I'm in the process of transferring some funds to the deposit address to give away!
