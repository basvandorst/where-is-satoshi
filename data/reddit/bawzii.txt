I agree with you on the banks, but from a common persons perspective it gets the job done, hope they wake up though

dark coin? wtf, litecoin, dogecoin, dark coin (50% instamined in 24h) won't succeed because nobody really going to use them outside the crypto space, they are not user-friendly at all, they won't matter much next year as real user friendly projects going to be build on top of bitcoin who actually are consumer friendly. It's already starting with 2.0 or 'appcoins' like storj and gems.

I can put my cash in a known bank and leave it there without worrying. with bitcoin you can't do this currently, its to hack sensitive and if you want to make it very secure then its not user friendly at all, thats why the big boys aren't in this yet

Not shitty altcoin, but real innovative apps build on top of bitcoin

I just saw your post history and you are spamming this on multiple places which i took a look at gems and it seems like a pretty solid project. Which makes me wonder if you could have been paid by a gems competitor by the fact of your dedication in this and how weak your actual case is which you keep repeating, it's normal to pay devs like these guys have been given. Can you mention what your profession is or are you a software/app developer by profession?
