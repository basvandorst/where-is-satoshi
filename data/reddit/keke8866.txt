Almost a 1BTC transaction fee! Am I reading that correctly?
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:35:09
My withdrawals have always been instant, as in I’ve never had to wait 11 days or even any days for that matter
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:34:50
Btc atm. They have them in most cities and all you have to provide is a phone number.
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:44:41
Okay cool sorry for the newb question but thanks for the info. Just getting into looking at all my transactions on the chain

@_date: 2019-06-30 01:47:23
Damn bro
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:49:14
Yeah I know smooth right. But thanks dude I was holding onto that last thread of hope
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:20:40
Sorry when I get excited I can’t contain myself. Should have seen me as a kid..
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:09:25
Yeah that or a bitcoin atm are my fall back plans only if absolutely necessary the mark up is pretty high from everything I’ve seen on local bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:20:59
I’m trying to find it at the moment. This was being deposited to a wallet with a changing address after its used and cash app doesn’t show me the full address
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:08:58
Long story but fortunately I have access to checking this wallet as well. And the transaction was confirmed Saturday night as of 10:57 pm but never showed
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:07:42
Where do you buy?
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:32:38
Well that answers a big question because I had been trying to figure out how to withdrawal my funds from there. Thanks
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:02:15
Well that’s what I thought too because when I tried to send it the first time it said it was an invalid address. So I realized there was an extra letter and something was lower case that was suppose to be capitalized. So I fixed it pushed send and it went through that time but never appeared in the wallet it was suppose to. And with cash app it will not allow me to see the full address that I sent it too. Even when I go in and download and export my full transaction history no where does it give me a full wallet address that it was sent to
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:08:43
Tried before but they don’t work in my state unfortunately
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:48:04
Yeah it was confirmed pretty quick unfortunately. Why do some transactions pend longer than others and some co firm extremely quick. I get it has to be verified on the ledger but are bigger amounts done quicker?
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:14:56
Well I haven’t a reason to lie about this. And if what you’re saying was the case then from it being withdrawn @ 10:57 pm on Saturday night until today Monday @ 5:14pm it still hasn’t shown up. I’d say that’s enough time to be verified on the network if it was the right address?
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:24:24
I have the first ten digits of the address is that enough or do I need the full? I apologize if this question seems ignorant
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:52:54
You’re right it’s not that’s what I have a Paxful wallet and also one with coinbase. Nevertheless it’s still convenient for quick purchases and simple withdrawals - until now. 
I’ve learned my lesson not to take the shortest/most convenient route as it can be costly such as this Instance was
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:57:12
Don’t sell!!
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:11:23
As of yesterday they weren’t. And because my bank double drafted me on a transaction so I tried to dispute it and I guess Coinbase thought I was trying to buy coin then cancel the transaction which was not the case at all. Needless to say they took away my buying rights. I still use coinbase as a wallet tho and to receive sometimes. Cash App is another story lol
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:46:09
Thought so. Needed to confirm tho
@_date: 2019-06-04 04:26:30
It was exactly 0.03868219 worth and I can post the 10 digits I have as well
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:47:06
Here for the answer. I recently switched from coinbase to Gemini / Etoro(which I really like by the way. Both the virtual and real setting they have. Pretty cool to make virtual trades @ a much higher amount than I do on my real trades to see what I can do) but wondering the best place to store my coin
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:57:05
Hope they have a respawn
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:23:35
Not currently. I have the first 10 digits to the address I withdrew it too I’m hoping support will respond with the full address
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:28:05
Yeah I’ve been investing for a while and never heard of this shit so thanks
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:54:22
Yeah I know and it never really mattered before I used my other wallet for BTC that I’m actually HOlding. But for simple transactions I used that. Really hurt me here
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:56:27
No I mean my account is now restricted aka banned from making any bitcoin purchases. I had 2 bank accounts and multiple cards used in the past and still connected to my account but when I try to purchase I just don’t have that option anymore
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:51:00
Yeah I did bring those upon myself. And while it may not be a lot of money for some for a college student like myself it’s a world of money so yeah a huge lesson was learned. Thanks
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:36:31
I know it’s pretty ridiculous isn’t it. That’s why I really like Paxful. I just used cash app occasionally because it’s so convenient to purchase and withdraw extremely quickly for pretty minimal fees really. Definitely a huge downside tho I never experienced with it until now
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:15:32
Please hit one million. That’s my wish
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:32:16
Yeah I tried that. Even exported my entire transaction history to excel and still no wallet addresses. Hopefully support has more info for me
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:19:08
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:11:11
I find it really weird to but unfortunately it is true my friend. Saturday evening I initiated a withdrawal for 0.03868219 or roughly $330~ at the time of withdrawal to an account and it never showed. The way cash app is setup unlike my Paxful wallet I can’t go in and see the transaction on the ledger and see exactly where it went.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:19:41
I’d be really interested in understanding more too. How could I find the transaction Id? In the ticket I opened with support through cash app could they tell me
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:53:26
Karma I suppose. Before the days of crypto I once checked my bank account and $500 had wrongfully been deposited into my account. Guess that’s the ebb and flow of life huh
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:22:04
Good question. On cash app it said withdrawn to the address that I sent it too
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:16:24
I can make the deposit electronically then just purchase using that bank account?
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:03:20
Yeah, I bought $50 with a green dot card just on Sunday. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:24:39
What vendors accept this bank. Trying right now to purchase. For example Coinbase doesn't accept this bank. Where can I buy bitcoin once I set up this account? Thanks a ton
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:25:19
Which vendor?
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:04:25
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:40:30
I just did it with a credit card on Sunday 
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:45:40
Coinbase
