Not exactly "buying stuff", but I have a small business that once and a while uses the services of a law firm in India.  We get bills of like $150 a month - and our bank  charges us $45 dollars to send the wire transfer (plus a warning that wire transfers to India are slow to clear).  Bitcoin would be nice here.

This is more or less how it is done now.  Servers don't (or at least shouldn't) store the plaintext user passwords.  Instead, they store an encrypted (hashed) version of the password.  
The problem is that many people use relatively short, unsecure passwords, so that when the password file is stolen, it is easy for the attacker to guess at common passwords and compare the hash of the common passwords to all the entries in the password file.  If people were to use super-long, random passwords (something on the order of bitcoin private keys), security would be really good.

A national digital currency is not a crypto-currency, as many of the comments point out, but I don't see why a national digital currency, based off bitcoin, is necessarily a bad idea (from the point of view of the issuing country).
From the user's perspective, it would look just like Bitcoin.  People would be familiar with how it works.  Existing wallet software could be essentially reused.  
The main difference of course is that there would be only one "miner", a trusted government computer, that would spit out a new block every X minutes.

They care.  Isn't that enough.  Virtually all transactions in the blockchain are in the category "nobody cares except the two people involved in the transaction."

Under the assumption that a passage is one contiguous section from a book, the number of combinations per book is not as large as you believe.  
Assuming 100k words for a book, you would need about 100k guesses to cover every combination of length N words.  So, about two million guesses to cover all the combinations over the range N from length 5 to 25 (all passages having lengths between 5 and 25 words).  In comparison, $20 on ebay will get you a USB ASIC that does a billion+ hashes per second.

There is nothing that dictates that "miners will have to recoup costs some other way."  They  may just lose money.  Rationale miners will quit until the transaction fees are enough to support the low-cost miners.  Is it a security issue - yes it may be; but that is all it is.
 The cost of supporting the mining infrastructure should definitely be ignored in these types of comparisons.  An analogy would be a merchant that gets charged 3% to have Visa card transactions processed.  The merchant's cost is 3%, not 3% plus some value to account for the billions that Visa spent building and maintaining the network.

I am not a tax expert, but I am pretty sure gambling losses can only be deducted to extent that they offset gambling winnings. 
Technically, you may even be on the hook for gains related to your trading of BTC/DOGE -I am not sure though.

It is 1% now because double spends are uncommon or non-existent.  If double spends become common, Bitpay/Coinbase will either stop accepting the risk or raise the fee.

I like Changetip, but I don't agree that Changetip is enabled by Bitcoin.  Changetip could just as easily be implemented with any currency - the only difference would be how people deposit and withdraw from their account.

I don't see why the cost of supporting the mining infrastructure is at all relevant to this comparison.  The miners get income from the block creation reward and the transaction fees.  It doesn't matter what the miners' costs are.  IF the miners' costs become too high, they will stop adding capacity or maybe even take capacity off line.  If the miners' costs are "too low," you would expect rational miners to continue to add capacity to make more money.

Anyone buying the colored coin would presumably pay for the coin itself plus the value it represents.  So in this case, if I was buying the .0001BTC color coin from you, I would pay .0001 BTC plus whatever the 1oz of silver is worth.

The patent appears to be owned by NHN Corporation, not Google.

From the merchant, perspective, Amazon would want to take bitcoin as they would avoid the high credit card transaction fees - and hence make more money.
I think the harder sell is from the customer perspective.  I've used bitcoin to buy things at overstock; it was fast, easy, and kind of cool.  Other than the novelty of bitcoin though, credit cards are still better for me.  Credit cards at amazon are super easy to use (one click!), I trust Amazon, and I get 1% cash back from my credit card reward card.

Pretty much all currencies have inflation.  The miner block reward is how bitcoin has chosen to distribute the newly inflated coins.  Inflation is a cost incurred to all holders of the currency, whether or not you do any transactions.  For the same reason, you will never see an analysis of US bank transaction fees that includes logic along the lines of "counting the X billion dollars a day of inflation, the average consumer actually pays Y per transaction."

You still need to pay for the initial investment in the dam and the generator, and ongoing maintenance costs.  
My car isn't free just because I chose to pay for it up front rather than pay in installments.
