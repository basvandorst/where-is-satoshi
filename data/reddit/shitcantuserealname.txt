The web site lightning.engineering is a good resource

If you don't have a lot of cash to spare/burn, I suggest you wait it out a bit, and let others to the testing.

A bit more important than the current price action!
For people wanting to try out LN, I recommend using `lnd` and Lightning App, both developed by Lightning Labs. That's been the least buggy experience for me, at least.

It's possible to make ASICs with memory. It's more expensive, but it will be cost effective one day.
There simply isn't an algorithm which can't me implemented by an ASIC. This is really just supper basic computer science, there's no point in refuting it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:55:08
We shouldn't trust Halong Mining, but give them an honest chance
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:07:57
You could then simply make one ASIC for each algo, and then change which ASIC you are using.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:30:20
ASIC-resitant PoW doesn't exist. What we need is a PoW-algorithm that's as easy as possible to make ASICs for. That way there will be competition in the manufacturing of miners.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:24:49
What do you mean? My point is that it's simply impossible to design an algorithm which can't also be implemented with an ASIC. One day, scrypt and other 'resistant' algorithms will have their own ASIC. When we're talking about a world currency a few years from now, there **will** be ASICs made. If those ASICs are hard to make, there will be little competition.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:10:03
And that's a good thing! That heightens the security of the network. What we need is healthy competition between several different producers. Halong Mining looks promising, so I'm somewhat optimistic in this regard for 2018.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:24:42
Ok. I then suggest you make a hard fork proposal for BTC, and see how it goes.
Vertcoins solution only works because VTC is not decentralized. That's not going to work with BTC, the only decentralized coin out there.
In addition, ASICs are a good thing for security. To stage a 51% attack, you'd need to amass an enormous amount of ASICs. Those machines simply doesn't exist. GPUs are abundant however, and that's a security flaw.

Again, what's needed is more manufacturers of ASICs. And you are correct in that not everybody is gonna afford ASICs. That's not really a big problem. The security of the network is more important than ensuring everybody can mine.
One we get more ASIC competition, I believe Bitmain influence will wane.

I'm saying that no world-changing technology is ready after only a few years of development. The internet and its underlying protocols was in development for several decades before Google or Amazon appeared.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:24:10
The internet wasn't very usable in the early nineties, either.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:27:46
It never worked as a transactional currency at scale. No cryptocurreny today does. However it has always worked as trustless, censorship resistant, sound money, and (hopefully) it will work as the same for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:25:57
Well, it is simply false. Bitcoin is controlled by all its users, and no one has absolute power. You could even look at the [codebase]( and see that it is composed of several hundred developers from several different countries, companies and backgrounds.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:25:47
I hate to break it to you, but no Bitcoin developer owes you anything. This is a permissionless system, but in that regard it's also a rightsless system. Either contribute in some way, or stop complaining.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:04:05
Do you have any evidence that they **do**? I guess the burden of proof is on you
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:28:53
That's exactly what the Core devs have been doing. Working and coding silently while the rest of us bicker.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:39:43
Can't remember where I read it first, but somebody on Twitter predicted that Trump will tweet about Bitcoin before 2018 is up. To be honest, I'd be surprised if he didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:14:08
IOTA is an absolute joke. They have had several days of downtime during the last year, not to mention that the devs was able to roll back several transactions because the entire network relies upon a single, authoratative server
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:40:31
I agree with this!
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:30:15
Of course it's worth knowing what goes into Bitcoin! And it's all open, for the world to see. On [GitHub]( you can read all the code and read all the discussions about the code.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:02:57
No users love these fees. But they are necessary in order to keep the network decentraliced and managable. There's a tradeoff here for sure, and until real scaling solutions are deployed in production, it's going to be painful.
As always there's no free lunch. Or do you have a super idea?
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:38:09
Again, check out the code. You'll see that the majority of commits are made by people who spend far more time coding than discussing. Many of the most prominent social media devs aren't among the most frequent comitters, for various reasons.

Both btcd and lnd is written in Go, and I guess that makes integration easier. The devs behind lnd are planning to include support for bitcoind, though.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:28:33
Btcdrak is behind it, I take that as a positive sign.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:52:52
He's a contributor Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:11:01
Twitter is honestly a much better medium for Bitcoin discourse right now.
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:11:21
Bye, bye, Erik Voorhees:-)

You don't keep BTC in a node. BTC are kept in addresses on the blockchain, and a wallet program (for example a full grown Bitcoin Core node) keeps the private keys needed to spend the BTC at those addresses. If you don't send or receive any transactions, there's no need to run a full node.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:48:21
I'm also all in! I have never had much savings, so there wasn't much to lose. Now there's something, but considering all the gains came from crypto I'm cool with it going up and down. My first home buy is in minimum 5 years anyway, so I'm not too worried.
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:36:19
The private keys are 'in the node'. They can then be translated into corresponding addresses.
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:51:00
In stead of saying there are 21 million BTC in circulation, you could just as well say there are 21 billion mBTC. What you designate as the base unit is completely arbitrary, it carries no real value.

That isn't really what cold storage means. [Cold storage]( refers to a wallet that has never been online. Such as for example a [paper wallet]( or a [hardware wallet] (
