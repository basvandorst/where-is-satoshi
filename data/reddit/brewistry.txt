I'm not a Clinton supporter but this claim is just stupid, she was not implying that encryption should be 'broken'.  I actually watched the debate, and she acknowledged that backdoors weren't a good idea, but admitted that having a 100% secure line of communication would make terrorists harder to catch.  Reasonable.  The Manhattan project quote, imo, implied she wanted industry to come up with a security system that was suitable for consumers, and would allow the government to have some access if needed, like most other types of non verbal communication  That isn't malicious, even if it is misguided.  And obviously you can't put the math behind encryption in a box and stuff it away.  There is nothing they can do about it, they'll accept that eventually, but until then of course it makes sense to try and find a middle ground where consumers are protected from bad actors, and the enemies of the people are not invulnerable.

Or the US citizens can use an open source encryption method without that backdoor.  I agree the idea of a backdoor of any kind massively weakens the encryption - but she did specifically say she wasn't advocating for back doors.  The government can't ban a protocol (what subreddit are we in...), so who cares if they want to do research into a different security protocol, which they could never really force people to use if they came up with a good one anyway.
I also agree that Clinton seems dishonest and I don't plan to vote for her - there are many legitimate problems with her and I just don't think the encryption topic is one.

You're right.  We should probably just dissolve the armed forces and hope for the best, that's a better plan.

Says the non-American in a thread about an American presidential candidate?  I don't like our current wars... but this is a thread about encryption, and it is ridiculous to assume that our government isn't or shouldn't be invested in technological defense.  Hillary's plan isn't the smartest around, but its hardly threatening as far as I can tell.  We can't exactly force our enemies (or anyone) to use shitty encryption, when great encryption is easy to come by.

People who want to harm the general populace.  I wanted to avoid calling out specific groups, but look at all of human history and take your pick.  Are you really implying that there are no and will never be any enemies of the american people?
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:41:19
It was either that, or invoke Hitler to try and convince this guy that defensive capabilities are sort of a great thing for a country to have.  Gotta pick your battles.
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:34:17
There probably is not a limited access solution as I acknowledged in my post, but to say definitively that there is no middle ground is short sighted - you have no idea what technology will look like a few years from now, who knows what someone will come up with. I do think they will find their efforts to be fruitless, also like I said in my post.  
I don't think Clinton is an evil lizard person out to take over the planet, I just think she is out of her depth, and making the obvious choices and statements someone in her place would make.  Cynicism can be pretty limiting people.

You can't tell me we shouldn't meddle in the affairs of others, while telling me everyone else has a right to meddle in ours because we're... Big and important or some shit.
She never mentioned banning strong encryption, you just made that up - and I'd bet she's heard that term once at most, and definitely doesn't understand it.  Again, they can't ban a protocol anyway. So why are you afraid? As you say, sheep scare easily...
@_date: 2015-12-23 19:02:40
Sure, I agree 100%, but again, that is not what was suggested.
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:26:22
That link suggests the 3.94 trillion figure in reference to the M0 currencies of 90 countries, making up 84% of the worlds population.  Given that they say that the US alone has about 0.9 trillion in M0 currency, its safe to assume that the 84% they looked at were generally poorer than most developed countries.
Your link also notes that in 2009 there were about 8.3 trillion USDs total, accounting for all the types of physical and non physical USDs.  That just about doubles the $187,619 figure you came up with, and thats assuming 100% adoption by the US only...  
Me thinks you're low-balling this a bit.  Whether or not OP is right, I don't know... but lets not make blind assertions that he is wrong based off of outdated and misinterpreted data.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:02:39
I should day... if hoarding increased alongside price, the percent of the total market transacted each day would decrease with price, leading to an average negative slope in the graph you linked to.
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:35:06
Well... 
There's 128 ounces (US!) per gallon, and one fluid ounce is 1.8 cubic inches.  So every ounce in a gallon is 1.8 cubic inches, and that adds up to 230.4 cubic inches in the whole gallon.
There! I think I answered your ridiculous question... Fitting for a thread about getting money out of Mt. Gox, yeah?
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:50:00
I think you sort of just proved his point... 
The fact that that graph is more or less flat shows that the value of daily transactions scales with the total value of bitcoins fairly well.  Your range on that plot is 0.01-0.06 of total bitcoin market value transacted per day.  Think of the price one year ago, and then where it is now - and note that we still transact the same percent of the total market value per day.  The price went up a metric shit-ton in that time, and yet every day we're still spending the same portion of the total value as we were a year ago (i.e. we are spending much, much more than a year ago using BTC).

Thank you.  I figured that had to be the case, it just struck me as off since every other thing I've read on wallet security stresses the crazy level of uniqueness for each key pair, and a shared BIP38 password doesn't fit that pattern.  But I get why it doesn't matter, they'd still need all my private keys and would still need to brute force the BIP38 encryption for the next few hundred years.

It looks like they ninja-edited that out, unless you're quoting the actual radio show?

At the very best, you can say that Coinbase made the decision to not make sales they couldn't honor.  At the very worst, they decided to cut off purchases to protect their profits on coins already in their possesion.  They are a business, and a generally awesome one at that... they won't end up like MtGox, they are a completely different kind of business.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:27:00
Still works for me... The mtgox home page doesn't, though, so who knows.
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:33:41
Ha, thanks man.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:35:13
It doesn't have the same site info on chrome now that you mention it... the mtgox homepage ID's as belonging to Mt. Gox (on chrome), this one  does not.

I guess my 25 character encryption key was a bit overkill, eh?
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:13:02
I'll be printing the paper wallets out &amp; storing an encrypted file containing the paper wallet images on a few usb drives.  That includes the private key... right?  I made it almost the whole way last night... until the blockchain.info app decided to crash on my phone every time I tried to scan my test public key qr code.  Sigh.

This is terrible, I don't have money in MtGox but obviously this is hurting everyone involved in bitcoin.  There's one thing I don't get though about everyone's reaction... why is it so implausible that they are still under some sort of federal investigation for the original silk road bust, and therefor cannot legally divulge any of the information about their financials... which may have pissed off some very large investors, who have since threatened their safety?  It's sort of a surreal scenario, but I don't see why it isn't possible.  
I will say that all signs do seem to point to insolvency or serious issues with their business, so I can't argue against the points others are making... but is what I stated above all that unlikely, really?

[Here]( is the article they cite in that link:


It sounds like this is geared towards businesses trying to get the banks to actually hold their bitcoins?

That's a real productive sentiment you've got there.  No one knows what really happened at Mt. Gox, so let's hate some faces like any decent human would. Right?

Not under patent, but not worth the investment for an ANDA application to compete with Turing.  There are ways to game the field due to the current regualtory system.  Basically they limit the supply of the available drug product by only allowing specific pharmacies to sell it... And to make a generic, you need some of the commercial product to prove you are making an equivalent generic product.  Note the lack of generic manufacturers of Daparim. What he did was majorly douchey, but totally legal and unfortunately not uncommon...

No comment on whether or not he's a total fake, which I like as a theory, but it is very common for VC backed virtual pharmaceutical companies (read: no labs, just $$ and lawyers) to be started up for the sole purpose of purchasing rights to drugs and/or making and marketing generics.
