You do realize it would take you a 20 second google search for coinmarketcap to see this "supposed" market cap, right?

Bitcoin can fulfill around 3.37 transactions per second when used to full capacity. 3.37 x 8 = 26.96 which puts it at 9973.04 (approximately) less transactions than much more robust tech (like iota) can do.

look at his interviews, whenever he gets cornered he goes into the "I DONT HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING" scapegoat 
where he dismisses arguments with rage.

I'd like to contribute by saying I grew up in a 3RD world country that's at the helm of the pc climate change hype. Electricity is officially 100% renewable and most of the population is forced to use barely any of it because of how fucking expensive it is. Of course facts don't come into play when you're shoving an agenda down peoples throats.

luffydude with the quality arguments, you're calling out that guy for being a bcash shill while you're a bitcoin shill... good luck with allowing ideologies to drive your thought process.

Not sure how pointing out the fact that you used quotations marks on a phrase that was never even uttered by satoshi is a straw man, the act of calling my argument a straw man without any basis; is a straw man.

No, it's not. I understood him fine, he didn't deliver the information that clearly but his comment is not unintelligible. He simply states that 1) despite your accusations of vitalik being a money grabber, he has widely contributed to the crypto space and 2) that you shouldn't use an assumption of what satoshi said as a literal quote.

oh boy...
Please try not to use ad hominen, control your emotions. Thanks.
1) 


No, the user named "Ben1113" said this, i quoted him so you'd understand him better
2) 


You most definitely did, see: 


It looks as if you're using an assumption of what Satoshi said to make the LITERAL point that he "shot down ethereum-like protocols"

But you did


So i actually went through the thread, didn't notice you had even linked it to begin with; i'll concede on that point. I assume you get into a lot of discussions/arguments on a daily basis which explains why you'd be frustrated with reiterating the same stuff endlessly. Please do try to not use ad hominem as often in your arguments, though. You could have settled this argument much earlier had you instantly pointed out that you did, in fact, reference a direct quote. I was counter arguing based on ignorance to that link. Either way, have a good day!
Edit: also, i'll make sure to read more carefully next time (:

They are when they take a story out of context and plaster a bullshit headline to whore as many ratings as they can.

No clue, I do know that spamming "i wonder if op was a bch shill in disguise" endlessly isn't one, though.
