Typo fixed, thanks.  
  
I understand what you are saying, but we are not here to complete with Coinimal or bitpanda, we are here to sell discounted gift cards for bitcoin.  
  
A lot of people want bitcoin, amazon gift card is an easy way to get it.

One day Amazon will accept Bitcoin, but for now, if you want to shop at Amazon using Bitcoin, you should make margin while you do it.

How Can I prove to you this is not a scam?  
Would you try a free code?

This is true for many sellers of digital gift cards, they end up buying the gift cards from carders.  
  
We have no third party supplier, we know where our codes come from, as things get rolling we will hold the gift codes for a few weeks before sale, this will further gurantee there is no charge back related problems.

From what I understand, purse.io traders buy high risk giftcards, and trade them for profit with concepts such as wishlisting.  
  
The supply side of purse is made up by traders, we supply our cards directly and gurantee they are good reliable reedemable gift codes.  
  
Plus our discount will soon be much greater than 15% ;)

These are not fake, these are just test transactions by us, to verify the system is working, once I remove the out of stock card these will disappear, It just makes the home page look pretty right now :)  
  
The website is MVP, a lot of text has not been edited yet, we do have process to protect customers, and we will provide a full refund or replacment gift card if anything goes wrong.

See my other response about why this is not the case with gift margin.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:40:23
Simply if there is a problem with the gift code we will replace it, 100% guranteed.  
  
You show us proof there is a problem, and we will replace is no questions asked.   
  
The average user is not buying from multiple purchasers, they are buying from sites like gift margin, if there is a problem we will resolve it instantly, no time or money wasted for you.

We are selling legit digital gift cards, we can provide you with a free sample to verify if you like.

Without going in to much detail: the gift card market is huge and buying Bitcoin is expensive, this allows for a narrow window of arbitrage.  
  
Did you know the average American has $20 of unused gift card credit laying around?
