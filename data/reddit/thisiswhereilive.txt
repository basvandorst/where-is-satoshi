As a creditor - this is at least reassuring that you say you will not be taking possession of the remaining bitcoins as a windfall. This loss of funds has already been devastating - and now consumed 4 years of my life. I, nor you, can change what happened in the past, but the very least that should happen is that the creditors should get the entire value of the appreciation of their original funds.
Make that part at least happen so that we get back 20% or whatever of our original funds, and I assume sometime around the year 2030.
When this is over, just fade away please and stay out of the limelight. I do not want to have anything against you personally - but everytime I see you in the news I get a swell of anger. The amount of damage you caused in our lives is enough - make it stop at some point. Please work to get us our remaining funds, and when that's done - let it be so we can just move on.

Well I hear it is also very typical for Satoshi to have access to his private keys! It is near trivial to prove to everyone he has them, and he cannot do so. The effort involved here is so low on the demand scale, that this man is either deranged, or what is more likely a fraud.

It is tough... I mean I could move coins to silence the majority of my critics but i am too wounded to silence them. At this point and it is not worth proving that I can move those coins anymore, my wounds will never heal after all the mean things people have said. I'd rather let them continue saying mean things instead of take a couple hours? to show that my claims are true.
Just iron-clad logic here folks, exactly what I would do in this situation.
