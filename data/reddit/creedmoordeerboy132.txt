They could give you a low fee transaction  that could take a couple days to confirm...leaving you sitting with unconfirmed bitcoin in your wallet.
But it's a garage sale...personally I'd let the stuff go with zero confirms...unless something u are selling is really valuable
My garage is still full of stuff cause my wife is cheap and asked too much
I'm having a free garage sale soon...just take this crap pleeaaase!!!

I break the price down into three parts:
1) what it is worth due to its actual utility ... I'll guess wildly ... $1000/btc
2) speculators who believe in the possibility of the tech .... guessing wildly .... $3000/btc
3) people who don't even know what it is but are hoping to double their money in one month...current price/btc
Group three is the bubble.

I bought bitcoin because I think that it is possible that it may one day achieve greatness and make me alot of money as a result.
It sounds like you bought it because you believed that it is a finished product.  You want to use it right now I think.  If thats true then you are the good kind of bitcoin person.  Me I am just a hopeful investor.
Im sorry it kinda sucks right now in some ways.
When I withdraw bitcoin from my exchange, I used it to trade some alts, poloniex charges me about $0.75 usd.  0.0001 btc per withdraw.  Unless they changed it and i didnt notice...not really paying attention.  Not sure why coinbase charging you so much.
If you were sending bitcoin from your own wallet you could set a very low fee of only 1 satoshi per byte.  That might take days to go through though.
Coinbase is not a wallet as far as I know.  It is an exchange.

In 20 years the millennial could have $2000 if they would just wise up and buy a bond.  Such returns!
And after 20 years the gas that now costs them $1.00 per liter will cost them $3.00 per liter...such gains.

You don't have to store them all in one address or one device or one method.
