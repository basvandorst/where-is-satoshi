You are literally trying to time the market, it rarely works.

You thinking that USDT starts flowing into BTC at some point?

Just take your $3,000 loss and add that to the price of the coins you are buying at a different price. That loss doesn't just disappear, it is added to your cost basis, until you sell.

Why do you think that?

Put the original back in, set aside the amount of taxes you will have to pay on the profits, use the profits to average in, if it goes below $7,500. 
Nobody knows what the price will do but its already up over $7,600.

I would encourage you to think 'outside the box' in terms of comparing to normal finance, which is based on easy money. I know a lot of hodlers who will sell if the price is right but that value will be transferred into other assets like real estate or other items that can also store value while serving a purpose.
I think the entire point of Bitcoin is to end our dependence on easy money that can be inflated to oblivion, by those whose policy it favors, and allow a free market determination of that.

You can zoom in, once you open it. It is on middle of right page.

I would say that the demo of those who even know and care about BTC have a higher than normal net worth. This means that 'most' of the big BTC holders are better off than the majority of the world population who is relatively poor. The issue is the price is determined on the margins and humans are subject to normal human emotions you see in every down cycle.

Any crypto transaction is taxable so going from btc to USDT is taxable, at least in the US.

It is a system that allows people to opt-in at any point in the adoption curve. In theory, putting your USD in now or later will allow you to offload an inflationary asset for an asset that holds and/or gains in purchasing power. The earlier you opt-in, the more time you have to gain in purchasing power. 
Those who don't understand it, will obviously opt-in later and not realize as much gain, but they will at least have an alternative to losing all of their USD like in other countries that have experienced hyperinflation.

whenever people think bitcoin is going to do something, it usually does the opposite. Prepare for that

I highly doubt they are buying up mass quantities of alt coins. This has to be 95% BTC, just based on demand.

I think he is referring to the pumps and dumps. Whales moving the market up, selling, then when price drops, they buy more than they originally had.

Yup, anyone's grandma would know how to use a computer, if she was born after 1990. I would BET the best generation who understands how tech works was those who tinkered on pc's in the 80's and 90's. Now, the hardware/tech is so solid and cheap that it doesn't make sense for young people to learn how they work. Just get a new one every 2 years.

This happened for 1 of 2 reasons:
1) The IRS doesn't know what they are doing
2) The IRS knows what they are doing and left this vague so that they can nail anyone who owns crypto for tax evasion, at some point in the future

That was because the market never actually corrected from the 2008 collapse, it was only bailed out. If you believe that fixed the underlying issue, then I guess your theory could hold true. IF you think that did not fix the underlying issues, we will be paying for it in the next recession/depression.
IMO, those who were entering the workforce or were relatively young in 2008, will not be fooled twice and look to ANYTHING that is an alternative to the rigged system they rightfully perceive it to be.

Why are the biggest pools in China? It would seem odd if most of the miners participating in those Chinese pools were not Chinese.

It could be ironic that those are the age group who could need it the most. Just wait until all the Boomers cash out of their stocks and expect the bond rates to keep up with inflation.

Do you understand Bitcoin, what it is and its potential? If not, read up on it and find out what makes Bitcoin unique. If you don't end up agreeing with those who think Bitcoin could really change things for a positive in the world, I wouldn't put any more money into it.

And this is the opportunity to distribute wealth in BTC. Sure, those who get in late will have fractions of what those whales had, but that is only because they didn't take on the risk those whales did, early on.
Eventually demand outstrips any dumping and price stabilizes at a large USD amount. 
I think you also have to remember that whales understand that 'cashing out' may be the dumb move in a few years. Why transfer your store of value to a inflationary asset when you can hold your btc, assuming less volatility and potential upside?

Haha, what age do you think people retire? 35?
